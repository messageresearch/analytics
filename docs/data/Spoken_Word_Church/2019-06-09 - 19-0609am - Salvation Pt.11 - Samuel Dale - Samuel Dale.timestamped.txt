[11:34] everybody together there's some of you
[11:37] that are visitors and we always say when
[11:39] you come one time here you're a visitor
[11:41] and we say to you welcome if you come
[11:43] two times you're just a part of us and
[11:45] also you know some of you have been here
[11:48] before so welcome back that's the best
[11:50] way to say it to the ones that hadn't
[11:52] been welcome to do that we've got a
[11:54] special little event this morning to
[11:58] transpire so let's get that out of the
[12:00] way as we go through into the service so
[12:04] if they'll bring the baby up we will
[12:06] have a baby dedication hey family all
[12:15] family Kondo - okay yeah come on family
[12:27] you've only here we're all family anyway
[12:30] so that that'll be part of it so I have
[12:34] to have a little one to dedicate to the
[12:37] Lord we don't believe in infant baptisms
[12:40] or something like that but we do believe
[12:42] that what the Lord Jesus done he took
[12:45] the little children and blessed them and
[12:47] you know dedicated them to the Lord so
[12:49] that's what we do we dedicate the baby
[12:53] to the Lord but now remember what we
[12:55] also do we dedicate everybody in the
[13:00] building where everybody's dedicated on
[13:04] this dedication not just the baby so
[13:07] you're dedicated to live your life
[13:09] before this child so they can have an
[13:12] opportunity in life so that's the
[13:16] greatest opera thing that I could think
[13:18] of of doing so let's get the little one
[13:21] and see if we can hold her
[13:27] maybe she won't wake up if we do we'll
[13:31] start screaming okay all right okay
[13:39] little Danielle Joy fountain so we
[13:44] dedicate her to the Lord and like I said
[13:47] now we're dedicating the baby to the
[13:50] Lord but remember we're dedicating
[13:52] ourselves to live before the child so
[13:55] that it can have an opportunity to be
[13:58] able to see God in all things so yeah
[14:02] hey you ain't gonna crowd me all right
[14:05] no you're gonna smile on me okay all
[14:07] right little Danielle joy family father
[14:11] we thank you for this opportunity of
[14:14] being able to hold this little one you

[14:24] Lord guiding each and every one of us
[14:28] and we believe you and we thank you we
[14:30] ask you now that you would just Lord
[14:33] accept the part of what we're all trying
[14:34] to do church and everybody family all
[14:37] together we're dedicating this little
[14:40] one to you for the Lord for you to be
[14:43] the great honor of all of its life and
[14:45] then we know too that as we dedicate the
[14:49] little one then we're dedicating
[14:51] ourselves to live before the child so we
[14:53] thank you for it we committed to you now
[14:55] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[15:00] and amen a I'm gonna wake up now now
[15:04] okay
[15:13] amen and amen dedicate them to God
[15:17] that's what our desire is not infant
[15:21] baptisms and or nothing like that but to
[15:23] dedicate dedicate ourselves now so don't
[15:27] forget that you that were present today
[15:30] you dedicated your heart and life to
[15:32] saying I'll live before this one so it
[15:36] can have an opportunity to see Christ
[15:38] and each one of our hearts and lives
[15:40] amen all right you'd like turning your
[15:46] scriptures turn to Ephesians two in Luke
[15:50] three we as I said many visitors with us
[15:55] and many that have been here before and
[15:57] we're glad to help
[15:58] brother brother John and his daughter
[16:00] back with us my my them back with us
[16:08] they walked with us for quite a while
[16:11] and now they come back for a few days to
[16:13] just be with us and honor so we
[16:15] appreciate it thank God for taking care
[16:17] of our sister she had a lot of problems
[16:20] and things and the Lord came down and
[16:21] just took it away so we thank God for
[16:23] that
[16:24] okay sister Monica's class is to
[16:28] practice 12:45 so remember that brother
[16:34] Louise is preaching for brother Burleigh
[16:37] remember him and all of the things that
[16:40] you have I wrote myself a whole bunch of
[16:42] notes so you know we'll try to get rid
[16:46] of some of them but just remember these
[16:48] things okay
[16:59] one o'clock today and then bottom stairs
[17:03] would meet together about the Father's
[17:06] Day outing next week we've got somewhere
[17:09] twenty-something of us that are planning
[17:12] on going right okay if the sisters go in
[17:19] another room and let them talk about
[17:21] what they're gonna do we talk about what
[17:24] we gonna do okay
[17:26] all right everybody understand visions -
[17:32] in Luke 3 father we thank you for this
[17:35] day in your grace and your love Lord
[17:37] thank you for an opportunity to be able
[17:40] to Lord stand before your people the
[17:44] purchase of your blood and to be able to
[17:46] talk about you and the great opportunity
[17:49] that we have to serve you we love you
[17:52] and we think and we ask you to just have
[17:54] your way with each one we know there's
[17:56] many sick among us you promised us that
[17:59] you would touch each one so we believe
[18:01] you and we ask you to just guide and
[18:03] direct each one and just have your way
[18:06] with all of us in Jesus name now
[18:12] remember we've been on this Ephesians -
[18:16] for quite a while so just think about
[18:20] you know what we're doing and just use
[18:25] the verse 8 for by grace are you saved
[18:29] through faith and that not of yourselves
[18:33] it is the gift of God now remember our
[18:36] point what it's been you're saved by
[18:39] grace through faith we said well I was
[18:42] saved by grace it's through faith it's
[18:44] through a journey through your life
[18:47] you're living your life as a journey to
[18:51] travel through and to see you know and
[18:54] you're saying all right now
[18:56] that's my salvation because that's what
[19:00] we've been on for quite a while okay
[19:02] look into Luke three and three he came
[19:05] into the law of the country about Jordan
[19:08] preaching the baptism of repentance
[19:11] for the remission of sins and it is
[19:13] written in the book of the words of
[19:15] Isaiah the prophet saying the force of
[19:17] one crying in the wilderness all right
[19:18] now just as the point before you're
[19:20] seated that's John the Baptist but the
[19:23] main thing is to see what his message
[19:26] was was repentance and remission of sins
[19:30] you may be seated
[19:32] Lord at his blessing through the reading
[19:34] of the word okay now we've been dealing
[19:40] with talking about salvation okay we
[19:48] know that in John 3 Jesus was trying to
[19:55] tell Nicodemus a simple understanding of
[20:00] what it was to be saved he was just
[20:04] trying to to tell him he he he tried to
[20:07] describe to him he said now you must be
[20:09] born to must be born again Nicodemus
[20:11] says oh you mean I got to go back to my
[20:14] mother's womb to be come forth again and
[20:16] he said no no no that's not the story
[20:18] that's not the point but you must be
[20:21] born to water and a spirit water and a
[20:26] spirit bringing him forth into the
[20:29] things that come from a new it
[20:30] all right the new birth the natural
[20:35] birth is a type or an example of the new
[20:38] birth right there is a baby comes into
[20:42] the world first the water breaks then
[20:45] the blood and then the baby coming forth
[20:48] into life so all right in other words
[20:52] what was simple if you'll think about it
[20:54] I tried to explain a little that Jesus
[20:58] was trying to get Nicodemus just to see
[21:00] one thing if he if he couldn't see and
[21:04] understand how that it would take this
[21:09] journey of a Christian life or a point
[21:12] and to bring forth and be you know
[21:16] showing forth to all mankind what we
[21:20] need to do to be saved our salvation
[21:24] okay all right in other words believe on
[21:27] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[21:28] saved
[21:29] all right we've got that right we've got
[21:32] our points and our thoughts in the
[21:33] scriptures right but the main point is
[21:37] I've been asking you the question do you
[21:42] what do you think about your salvation
[21:46] because if the Lord Jesus was right and
[21:49] we believe that then he was saying that
[21:51] you must be born of water and the spirit
[21:53] in other words natural birth would
[21:56] exactly be the example he's trying to to
[21:59] describe to Nicodemus what is the
[22:03] natural birth water blood and life all
[22:06] right now what would it take then to
[22:09] make the new birth if that's the first
[22:13] birth why would it not be the same
[22:15] things in example form our thoughts of
[22:19] the new birth is it was to talk about a
[22:23] natural birth see then that shows us
[22:26] where we stand then as I said we look at
[22:28] what happens in the natural we see
[22:30] what's happening in the spiritual all
[22:32] right see then what was what have we
[22:35] dealt with in our thoughts and ideas of
[22:37] trying to to bring it to a point of
[22:42] understanding that do you first must be
[22:48] drawn of God other words salvation your
[22:53] first step in the salvation is the fact
[22:56] of whether or not God calls you called
[22:58] in in John 6:44 word and going on down
[23:03] to 65 Jesus was telling them what no man
[23:08] can come to the Father except by me in
[23:12] other words and he said it can't be done
[23:15] unless my father draws it all right so
[23:19] salvation is based upon not whether or
[23:22] not you accept God that's a part of the
[23:27] story but it's upon the basis of whether
[23:30] or not he would accept you
[23:33] all right so repentance or remission of
[23:36] sins is to be priests in the name of
[23:38] Jesus Christ all right now see then in
[23:43] doing that then you see that God must
[23:48] deal with each individual person
[23:52] all right he doesn't deal with a group
[23:55] he deals with each individual the person
[23:58] sitting right next to you can be going
[24:00] through the experience and you sitting
[24:03] there knowing nothing about it but it's
[24:05] not for a group it's an individual he
[24:09] went to the individuals when he was here
[24:11] see Nicodemus was our Peter was our the
[24:15] different ones the ones the Lord Jesus
[24:17] called as he journeyed you know come and
[24:19] follow me you know it's an individual of
[24:23] fire with God it's not what mama done
[24:27] it's not what daddy done all that's well
[24:30] and good we dedicated the baby we
[24:33] dedicated ourselves to live before the
[24:35] child a life to where the child can see
[24:39] Christ that's wonderful
[24:40] all right but just remember mama
[24:44] salvation won't save you daddy salvation
[24:50] won't save you it's got to be your own
[24:53] personal experience so then the new
[25:00] birth what is it then is to be born into
[25:04] the family of God just as the natural
[25:07] birth is to bring you into the natural
[25:10] family upon earth your spiritual birth
[25:14] brings you into the spiritual family
[25:17] okay and as it brings you into that part
[25:21] of the family then you can see your own
[25:24] self in your experience all right now so
[25:30] what has been our point do you remember
[25:32] when God first contacted you or you know
[25:38] begin to deal with you know to tell the
[25:41] star in the book of Acts you know where
[25:44] that three thousand was coming
[25:45] that is they heard the message preached
[25:48] by Peter the last part of Acts 1 -
[25:51] coming through they heard a great
[25:54] message about the Lord Jesus and what he
[25:56] had done and what he come to do and how
[25:59] everything was to be done and and work
[26:02] you know and as they did then they
[26:04] become the Bible says pricked in their
[26:06] heart let's see have you ever been
[26:12] pricked in your heart you said well what
[26:14] does that mean
[26:14] they don't mean stick it says pretty
[26:17] that's you know yeah it's not not that
[26:20] point it's have you ever had anything
[26:23] something to happen to you to her that
[26:27] you knew something was dealing with you
[26:28] maybe it's a way of putting it her
[26:31] however the thought that is you was then
[26:36] you begin to pray you begin to seek God
[26:40] all right so then you can see truly that
[26:43] repentance and remission of sins is
[26:46] where you starting your journey as a
[26:48] Christian and you accepting Jesus Christ
[26:53] as your Savior all right but has he
[26:58] accepted you well I didn't know he had
[27:04] to accept me well then you do now go see
[27:08] that's the point that salvation is
[27:10] deliverance
[27:11] all right he he must accept us we can
[27:19] call all day long upon him and do
[27:21] whatever we do we can baptize we can
[27:23] repent we can cry out we can do all
[27:25] things but if he doesn't accept us well
[27:30] now if he if he's not calls you he
[27:34] doesn't have to worry about accepting
[27:35] you that's why the scriptures is correct
[27:39] see it says what repent every one of
[27:42] them be baptized in the name of Jesus
[27:44] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[27:46] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[27:48] for the promise is unto you right if you
[27:54] follow in his word then he's promised
[27:58] you
[27:59] alright now I won't the promises of God
[28:03] I don't I don't know where you think
[28:05] about it like that I sure want to and I
[28:07] don't mean this wrong there's a comical
[28:09] point but uh if there's anybody or
[28:12] anything you know I've always said it
[28:15] like this if I ain't gonna Rob anybody
[28:20] you know I'm not gonna do that I take
[28:22] one thing about it I'm gonna Rob you
[28:24] before I rob him because I won't stay on
[28:28] the good side with him all right is that
[28:32] your point don't you want to stay on the
[28:34] good side with the Lord so if I'm gonna
[28:37] rob anybody more Rob you you know and
[28:40] that'll that'll that'll set it up but
[28:42] I'm not gonna do that anyway it's just
[28:44] an illustration appoint of what we're
[28:47] talking about but really he has God ever
[28:51] dealt with you because in the Bible
[28:53] there they would come to a point and
[28:56] they would recognize that God was
[28:59] leading them and then they would move on
[29:02] into the Lord and go on has he ever done
[29:04] that to you do you remember when you
[29:06] first went to the altar say like that
[29:09] when you first had contact with God
[29:13] through some feeling thoughts or ideas
[29:17] or you know some concept or whatever
[29:21] something dealing with you to worth it
[29:26] you're you know and realize God is real
[29:33] see then that away you come to
[29:38] repentance so what's the first thing in
[29:40] God repentance he's calling you he's
[29:49] contacted you he's spoke to you now
[29:54] what's he saying what's the next time
[29:57] you do repent and be baptized in the
[29:59] time of Jesus Christ all right now you
[30:02] got to do the repentance part because
[30:05] see repentance will show whether you're
[30:07] genuine or not those who repent is not
[30:10] what we always thought it was
[30:12] we always thought repent was to say I'm
[30:15] sorry well that's good that's a that's a
[30:18] definition of it but the real meaning of
[30:20] repentance is to turn around you think
[30:24] about it it means literally turn around
[30:26] you were going one way you turn around
[30:29] go the other way
[30:30] you were living for the devil you were
[30:32] walking in his room and doing his thing
[30:34] and then you repent and say God forgive
[30:37] me
[30:38] well you don't keep walking the same way
[30:41] doing the same thing right so you turn
[30:45] around and go the other way so
[30:48] repentance and the remission of sins
[30:50] would be in the name of Jesus Christ all
[30:53] right now see if your repentance is
[30:56] genuine now we're back where was a
[31:00] second ago if your repentance is genuine
[31:02] see now you're contacting God and asking
[31:07] him to accept you right you're asking
[31:13] him to accept you as his child all right
[31:18] what's he saying
[31:19] all right I'm taking your word Enid ours
[31:26] were to me the whole Bible is based upon
[31:31] what would be the words we could use
[31:35] commitments and things like that life is
[31:40] based upon those things you make a
[31:42] commitment you you get married you you
[31:45] do this you do that you build a new home
[31:47] you get a new job you get a different
[31:49] commitment or thoughts and ideas
[31:52] let's see God simply ask you to accept
[31:57] him as your Savior and if that's genuine
[32:01] you know what
[32:02] then he'll accept you I'll remember the
[32:07] point you can accept him all of your
[32:09] life but if you're not genuine well oh
[32:15] do you know I asked him to save me there
[32:18] was you genuine did you turn around or
[32:23] did you keep living the same life you
[32:26] was living but claiming I'm a Christian
[32:29] now because I've repented you know God
[32:34] knows better than that
[32:35] he knows whether or not we're sincere
[32:38] right so don't make no commitments that
[32:43] you don't want to live by that's really
[32:46] the main points you know whatever it is
[32:48] in life don't make it commitments unless
[32:50] you intend to live by that commitment
[32:52] and see then salvation is based upon
[32:59] whether or not your repentance is
[33:05] genuine simple thought simple point to
[33:11] talk about salvation
[33:13] well I cried I've done this out well
[33:15] that's wonderful all that's good but
[33:18] what about what led you there what about
[33:22] this did did you get a contact from God
[33:28] did he come down and speak to you you
[33:31] know one way or the other you become
[33:35] convicted of your life you become you
[33:40] know said my lord I'm sorry you said
[33:47] well well the Bible says if I'll repent
[33:49] then he'll accept me all right that's
[33:52] wonderful you got the Bible but remember
[33:55] a half-hearted confession is not a
[34:00] repentance you know that's why I said
[34:04] repent means to turn around because when
[34:07] you say I'm sorry as cheap words that
[34:16] means I'm sorry a lot of it means I'm
[34:18] sorry then I got caught right it's not
[34:24] sorry to want to get rid of it it's
[34:26] sorry I got caught okay see then that's
[34:32] what we ought to think about God when he
[34:33] contacts us not to just use the words
[34:37] I'm sorry
[34:40] now come on kids come on adults you know
[34:43] what I'm talking about
[34:45] you know Mama and Daddy got on saying
[34:48] you said I'm sorry what did you call it
[34:52] that little doggie face what was it
[34:55] what's the word fart little thing you
[34:57] know that you got the doggy eyes and you
[34:59] looking at mom and dad and you say I'm
[35:02] sorry that's in about two days later
[35:08] you're standing there saying I'm sorry
[35:13] Tim order I'm sorry
[35:15] right see it's not genuine you
[35:19] understand my point God knows whether or
[35:22] not our heart is true and right up in up
[35:25] on him he knows that sure more than we
[35:27] do
[35:29] so repentance and remission of sin is to
[35:32] be preached in the name of Jesus Christ
[35:35] okay you accepting Jesus Christ as your
[35:40] Savior is a wonderful thing but if
[35:45] you're genuine your repentance is not
[35:46] genuine
[35:47] he doesn't have to accept you that's my
[35:50] point that's that's the whole goal of
[35:53] what I'm driving at to us to think about
[35:57] you know do you you you get preachers in
[36:02] them I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm
[36:04] just putting to playing but you you know
[36:07] you get a lot of people a lot of
[36:09] preachers they'd like to get up the
[36:10] pulpit and they like to condemn you
[36:12] right
[36:14] they'd like to try to make you humble
[36:16] hearted by condemning you well that's
[36:22] wonderful
[36:23] that's all right but does it last
[36:34] how long did it last the first time you
[36:36] repented I told you about man he used to
[36:45] come to church with us we would go you
[36:47] know every time we have any kind of
[36:49] revival or anything we go to them you
[36:50] know try to talk to him and he said I'm
[36:54] coming he would he'd come that night and
[36:56] he'd get an altar and he'd probably pray
[36:59] and crying he'd get up and I'm saying
[37:01] now well he never made it till the next
[37:04] night no he never made the next meeting
[37:08] well a year later you go back to the
[37:10] same man contacting you well that's the
[37:13] point of what I'm trying to say that's
[37:14] one of them I'm sorry
[37:17] I'm sorry mama daddy forgive me I'm
[37:23] sorry
[37:25] well you give me a chance I'm gonna do
[37:27] it again
[37:28] you know how I've always held it my kids
[37:32] grandkids great-grandkids they have a
[37:36] halo over their head held up by horns
[37:46] Jacobs life and he'd heard that before
[37:49] held up by horns oh we got the group who
[37:55] got the best kids in the world don't be
[37:58] deceived puppy dog crying you know ya
[38:05] tell will me well we certainly don't do
[38:08] like brother Gary Atkins dad was a
[38:11] doctor and he was a great old guy and
[38:16] the way he'd done things always mama
[38:19] would come in and say oh you know the
[38:22] Gary's been doing wrong you need with
[38:24] him
[38:25] well you know dr. Atkins would take Gary
[38:29] into the bedroom lay him down across the
[38:32] bed and get his belt he'd wind up real
[38:36] hard and he won't need he hit the bed
[38:43] a couple of times hitting the bad girl
[38:44] look at him he said you don't say what's
[38:46] going on
[38:47] he said power he said oh oh okay he hit
[38:53] a bit yeah
[38:59] no do granddaddies though do grande that
[39:04] is but we got one sitting back in the
[39:07] back here that tell you a story that
[39:09] none of the rest of the grandkids can
[39:10] tell you cousin none of them has ever
[39:14] been wilt by me yeah Zach wouldn't get
[39:22] down off the ladder where I could do the
[39:23] work every time I'd get him off one side
[39:26] he'd go up the other side
[39:27] he wouldn't about 2 or 3 years old you
[39:29] know I kept telling him boy I will whip
[39:33] you when he you didn't believe it he
[39:37] kept running up that ladder getting in
[39:39] my way I really did give him old man I
[39:41] just beat him to death you know what I
[39:43] mean pretty money and I went and I said
[39:47] now get yourself in the house and well
[39:51] he'll tell you till today that pawpaw
[39:53] beat the daylights out of him but he
[39:58] remembers it at least he did get off the
[40:00] ladder and get out him away what's he
[40:03] saying I'm sorry it's cheap just
[40:08] remember when you're telling your buddy
[40:11] your husband your wife your daddy your
[40:14] mom Lee whatever invokes when you're
[40:16] telling them you're sorry you know
[40:19] eventually they'll find out whether
[40:21] that's right or not right somewhere down
[40:23] the road they'll find out but just
[40:27] remember the one point when you tell god
[40:30] you're sorry he already knows before
[40:33] you've ever said it whether you mean it
[40:36] or not he's already knows what before
[40:41] you say it what do you mean it or not so
[40:45] there's no need of trying to pull one
[40:47] over on him you say well what do you say
[40:51] you pray you pray Lord
[40:56] I mean I ain't gonna do that again I
[40:57] don't pray that away I mean if you pray
[41:03] that way how many of you pray like that
[41:04] God you help me and I ain't gonna do
[41:06] that again a few days later you done
[41:12] done it again I don't pray that way I
[41:16] said Lord to help me take care of me
[41:19] forgive me for doing it but now Lord you
[41:24] take away the need of that your memory
[41:26] explaining about maybe if you smoked or
[41:29] something like that ask God to take away
[41:31] the need and the desire of the cigarette
[41:34] now you got it right all right see
[41:39] you've got God on your side to
[41:41] understand it you're a human being
[41:44] because that's one thing he understands
[41:46] we are and that's the point of what I'm
[41:49] getting at after where he knows
[41:50] salvation whether it's genuine or not so
[41:56] you're not fooling nobody cuz like I
[41:58] said eventually mom and daddy whatever a
[42:02] brother-sister husband why water
[42:04] eventually they're gonna catch up with
[42:06] each with us and we're gonna be in
[42:08] problems right I see God knows before
[42:13] you ever start he knows why we do those
[42:20] things he knows our thoughts and all
[42:23] before we ever even think them he knows
[42:30] whether our repentance is genuine or not
[42:32] and that's what I'm getting at
[42:34] if our repentance is not genuine why
[42:37] repent well I never heard you anybody
[42:42] reaching okay well I'm just honest
[42:44] that's one thing you'll find out about
[42:47] it I'm honest I don't try to stretch
[42:49] nothing I just tell it like it is the
[42:54] day Danny got his boat hung up in the in
[42:56] the lake he was looking for me to get
[42:59] out and he said one of us has got to get
[43:01] out I said
[43:02] not my vote
[43:09] I'm just honest being honest in a whole
[43:14] lot straighter that's what my wife said
[43:17] you stab a lot of trouble if you and be
[43:19] honest tell everything well I'll try to
[43:22] be that way than to be anything else
[43:23] what about you you see I believe in the
[43:28] salvation that works from an inward
[43:31] experience to were that it works
[43:34] outwardly through us and we are a triune
[43:39] being you know like a body and then we
[43:43] have a spirit within us that the body
[43:45] has five senses he takes fields melting
[43:47] here and in your spirit within you has a
[43:49] five senses of memory reason conscience
[43:53] affections etc that's working in your
[43:55] spirit room and then your soul that has
[43:59] one in one sentence are you know call it
[44:02] is either faith or doubt it's either
[44:04] true or not true it's either right or
[44:08] it's wrong and see then we're not
[44:11] deceiving nobody in doing it and we're
[44:14] certainly not deceiving God in doing it
[44:16] because so you you don't sin with your
[44:19] body you think you do no no no you don't
[44:23] sin with your body I'm gonna fix that in
[44:26] hurry do you think you seen with your
[44:29] body come up here and call me a liar but
[44:31] give me a hammer what do you mean right
[44:38] before you say before you call me some
[44:41] dirty night mama hits you in the head
[44:42] with a hammer I'm gonna knock you out
[44:44] you don't send with your body
[44:46] simple simple terminologies you sin in
[44:50] your spirit room or your memory reason
[44:53] your conscience affections is dwelling
[44:56] within that room there's were you sinned
[45:00] from and we send from that point of us
[45:06] that is the one that motivates us then
[45:14] we can love God actually be loving it
[45:16] with our spirit and not living in with
[45:19] inward being of what is called a soul
[45:25] the David would cry out and said Lord
[45:30] forgive me he said my soul troubles me
[45:35] he would cry out and ask God to forgive
[45:38] him but there was nothing back there
[45:41] because he was living in a time frame it
[45:44] that were there was no new birth because
[45:48] Jesus Christ had not come and died yet
[45:50] he had to come and die and release the
[45:52] life to come back into us and you know
[45:55] to make us to where we could be
[45:56] Christians but David would cry out in
[46:00] his heart and longed for God to help him
[46:03] you didn't go right back and do things
[46:08] but you see we're supposed to be
[46:10] Christians we're supposed to be to the
[46:13] point that when we ask God to forgive us
[46:16] that we're crying out from that inward
[46:18] part of us that part of us that's so
[46:25] longing to see God you ever been that
[46:29] way you were just desired to see God you
[46:37] desire to disable or died like to was it
[46:40] job that basically and perforating it he
[46:45] wanted somebody that he could go you
[46:48] just studied the book of Job he wanted
[46:50] somebody that he could go to a knock on
[46:52] the door doctor yes that's fire phrase
[46:56] in the old Bible or what he wanted he
[46:59] wanted to contact that God that had
[47:02] created him brought him into being and
[47:04] contacted him and time he wanted to
[47:06] contact he wanted to go and knock on his
[47:08] door and him to come out and talk to him
[47:12] that should be our whole Christian
[47:15] desire is to be able to contact our
[47:20] maker and be to the point that we could
[47:25] say lord I can't do this
[47:31] you know if for our problem is we think
[47:34] we can live a Christian life by
[47:35] ourselves but we can't do it we can't
[47:38] live a Christian life by ourselves
[47:40] it takes guard to live a Christian life
[47:43] there's a saying knows it takes Christ
[47:45] to be a Christian right and you know
[47:50] what I'm talking about is true we can do
[47:52] fine for a few days but then all at once
[47:54] we fall back that's you then we go right
[48:01] back to God and say God forgive me help
[48:03] me you know what he'll forgive us but
[48:10] then when he comes to a point to after a
[48:11] while he says straighten up get straight
[48:18] you've been here too many times your
[48:21] little puppy-dog face it's not doing any
[48:23] good cuz I know why you're doing these
[48:25] things David would cry out he said Lord
[48:32] my soul thirst after thee there's a deer
[48:38] panteth after the water Brooks we
[48:41] hunters know what that is you get to
[48:43] shoot the deer it wants to run to water
[48:47] it's thirsty it's got to get to water to
[48:50] live see that's what David was crying
[48:52] out lord or just come and help me
[49:04] now what's the point I'm trying to get
[49:06] to and quit you see the disciples they
[49:12] had walked with the Lord Jesus to his
[49:14] life for three and a half years been
[49:17] trained and taught by him and tutored in
[49:20] Hoorn things great things were happening
[49:23] they were praying for the sick there
[49:26] were many different things were
[49:27] happening the healing of the sick was
[49:30] taking place by the disciples and yet
[49:35] they could never get to a complete
[49:38] release that they wanted the potatoes
[49:44] hired but you know they come a day when
[49:50] it like I like the scripture overhead
[49:53] since I give it to you the other day you
[49:54] know or the pilot in disciple says or
[49:57] Jesus says it as I was sitting out do
[50:00] you now believe you know that's a pretty
[50:02] good point there's D and I believe you
[50:05] know they said well we believe this we
[50:07] believe that we think this he said do
[50:09] you now believe in other words are you
[50:12] really sincere about you believing do
[50:16] you want to be a Christian everybody
[50:20] wants to teach to you and talk to you
[50:22] about going to a great happy hunting
[50:23] ground or a beautiful place or going up
[50:26] to glory or to heaven or whatever we
[50:29] want to do but do you really want to
[50:35] give up everything here to go there what
[50:39] if he asked that what if he asked us to
[50:42] give up what we joy we enjoy here you'll
[50:45] be able to go there would we consider it
[50:50] to be worthy
[50:57] worth it all to give up everything you
[51:01] remember the rich young ruler well he
[51:04] done everything and Jesus didn't argue
[51:06] with it
[51:06] I've done all these things kept him off
[51:08] my youth he didn't argue with him says
[51:10] wrong he knew he had but he hid him
[51:16] weren't hurt he said go sell everything
[51:20] you got and give it to the poor
[51:21] come follow me he knew the point that
[51:28] would cut the man more than anything was
[51:31] his money but you know what the money
[51:37] didn't mean anything cuz I'm like this
[51:46] honest and sincere heart is what God is
[51:50] looking for that's the corner of the
[51:53] scripture our good doings our good lives
[51:57] is fine if it's little from a Christian
[52:02] life within to come out and let others
[52:07] see Christ in our lives but you see
[52:13] there was one walk there with them with
[52:17] the disciples there was a man walk with
[52:21] the disciples he had part of the
[52:24] ministry the Bible says he healed the
[52:27] sick he cast out devils and things like
[52:29] that he walked out with him his name was
[52:35] Judas they nothing wrong with Judas in
[52:41] the writings of the scriptures you have
[52:45] nothing until you come now we know that
[52:47] Jesus being Almighty God knew whether
[52:49] Judas was gonna be right or wrong sure
[52:51] we know that but get to point he was not
[52:56] beaten and hammered about his life he
[53:01] had his own choice to make as I said has
[53:05] God called you will see he called each
[53:07] one hundred apples and said come follow
[53:10] me
[53:11] he called Judas and said come follow me
[53:18] you know what Judas followed him for a
[53:20] long ways Judas followed him as far as
[53:26] repentance he fathered him as far as
[53:33] baptisms he went a long ways walking
[53:45] with the Lord
[53:46] each day fellowshiping with it but what
[53:54] made the difference then well ninety
[54:01] differs in the 120 and Judas
[54:13] could it be but the Lord knew he wasn't
[54:17] sincere and his heart would not that be
[54:23] the best answer he done only could do
[54:27] and walked and done think any honor did
[54:30] he he accepted Jesus Christ as his
[54:33] Savior as we'd call him you know but God
[54:35] he'd say well you know we believe you
[54:37] we've living on what you're doing and
[54:40] your works and was trying to do the one
[54:44] made the difference
[54:49] something came up that became more
[54:51] important to him than his salvation
[54:56] there was money the money's gonna get
[55:05] most people right popularity the ones
[55:11] money is another bad thing it's gonna
[55:15] get most all of us some one way or the
[55:17] other
[55:19] none wrong with having money I believe
[55:25] it's the rich young ruler I'm serious I
[55:27] believe that if the rich young ruler
[55:29] when Jesus said go sell what you got
[55:31] give it to the poor if he said Jesus
[55:33] I'll give him my thumb is that okay I
[55:35] believe he'd he said okay no he didn't
[55:38] need his money right anybody that could
[55:45] send somebody down to the river and
[55:46] throw in the line and draw out money out
[55:50] of a fish
[55:50] he didn't need nobody you understand
[55:54] wasn't getting out God don't need your
[55:56] money in mind it's the pleasure to get
[55:59] to give it to it it's a joy to give it
[56:02] to him it's an honor to give it to him
[56:03] he don't need it
[56:11] but you see Judas come to that point
[56:13] that he made a decision come on I quote
[56:21] the Prophet to you know that he said
[56:24] Judas come to justification Judas come
[56:27] to sanctification in his salvation you
[56:38] can't say Judas was any different than
[56:40] Peter than him I mean Judas didn't wind
[56:47] up cussing about it Peter wound up
[56:48] pretty well got fouled up when he didn't
[56:51] want to be recognized as being with the
[56:54] Lord Jesus right you remember that in
[56:56] the Bible
[57:01] and Judas after seeing what he done he
[57:04] went out and hung yourself cuz he did
[57:11] but the man he had walked with for three
[57:13] and I've years all the time knew his
[57:16] heart knew him well enough to know who
[57:22] yet trusted him he was the treasurer of
[57:25] the church he didn't beat him and a
[57:31] hammer on him what good is that that's
[57:33] what most people think salvation is you
[57:36] know you'd beat somebody some enough to
[57:39] get them on the altar
[57:40] there's two ways of breaking a horse
[57:42] he's gonna break it with love or you can
[57:44] break it with a whip both of them will
[57:51] achieve the same then but which one do
[57:54] we want I'm just talking about salvation
[58:05] Jesus told Nicodemus said you must be
[58:07] born again
[58:12] you say well well he just didn't
[58:14] understand all he had to do is believe
[58:17] and wait a minute you got a man that was
[58:20] coming to Jesus that was putting his
[58:22] life on the line his job on the line and
[58:24] they had a lot of trouble if they found
[58:25] out he was there because they were
[58:28] certainly gonna be ice cream right if
[58:32] they found out he was there the church
[58:37] I'm just asking a simple question is
[58:39] what I've been asking can you go back in
[58:42] your life and find a place that you
[58:44] found God or you started is that still
[58:55] holding you today can you still remember
[58:56] that are you like this soldier was you
[58:59] know that was dying you know chaplain
[59:04] went in and talked to him he said where
[59:08] was your last contact with God can you
[59:11] remember it well he laid there for a
[59:14] little while and looked around and all
[59:16] at once he says now I lay me down to
[59:18] sleep he knew what he left God do we
[59:28] know where we've left him at you know
[59:31] where he's at
[59:32] right where we left it he's waiting on
[59:37] me and you because that's the point
[59:40] we're talking about what we make our
[59:42] commitment we accept him as our Savior
[59:46] we make our commitment then he accepts
[59:49] us and well we walk with Him and we have
[59:51] a wonderful experience in love do you
[59:59] remember were you life's contact was
[1:00:09] what about it me what constitutes as
[1:00:17] we're ending up the natural birth water
[1:00:25] good life what constitutes the spiritual
[1:00:31] birth believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:38] as our Savior accepting him as our
[1:00:40] Savior pleading the blood to cleanse us
[1:00:44] and set us aside and then let him come
[1:00:50] and fill us but remember a simple little
[1:00:54] story that always had helped me your
[1:00:58] beginning of your experience your
[1:01:00] example of that is like that you're
[1:01:02] laying out in our chicken yard your
[1:01:05] glass or a cup mister story you're a
[1:01:09] glass or a cup laying in a chicken yard
[1:01:13] someone decides they have a need for
[1:01:15] that so they reach down and they pick up
[1:01:19] the glass you don't put nothing in the
[1:01:23] glass cuz it's dirty you don't pour the
[1:01:26] water in it you don't wanted to use it
[1:01:28] right but you've got a reason for
[1:01:31] picking it up that's what God done with
[1:01:35] you and I he stooped all the way from
[1:01:39] glory to come to earth to pick us up
[1:01:49] remember Saint John 17:17 he he
[1:01:53] sanctified them he said a mossad he
[1:01:58] cleansed him that's what he's willing to
[1:02:01] do any me and you see that's what
[1:02:02] repentance does repentance works on the
[1:02:06] basis of cleansing because you take that
[1:02:09] glice and you taking the house and you
[1:02:11] scald it you know you wash it you got it
[1:02:16] right but it still ain't news yet you
[1:02:19] got a purpose for it
[1:02:23] when you put it to the purpose that you
[1:02:25] do and you fill it with water or
[1:02:26] something to drink or whatever you're
[1:02:29] doing you know a liquid something you're
[1:02:31] using it for now you got it to the basis
[1:02:33] what you're using it for and that's what
[1:02:36] God is doing with every one of us see
[1:02:39] we're making their own decisions as to
[1:02:43] where we stand
[1:02:50] let's say you say well I've asked God to
[1:02:52] save me that's good but did you make any
[1:02:59] promises in that time just remember if
[1:03:05] you don't keep them you don't have to
[1:03:06] keep it you don't keep them you know how
[1:03:11] to keep this all on the basis of what
[1:03:15] you keep well I believe I believe I'm
[1:03:20] saved oh great but do we live like the
[1:03:27] devil and claim to be saved if we live
[1:03:36] like a devil that's the one that's
[1:03:37] living within us right well what about
[1:03:44] your salvation can you put it on the
[1:03:48] basis of saying I believe the Word of
[1:03:53] God what it says to do and don't do I
[1:03:57] try I said
[1:04:05] you don't say I'll do because you might
[1:04:08] not do it just say Lord I'll try cause
[1:04:14] you'll find out one day that trying will
[1:04:17] turn into a definite commitment then
[1:04:21] you'll realize that hey I done the best
[1:04:23] thing in the world what's to say unto
[1:04:25] Him God help me cuz I need help
[1:04:35] what about it can we put our salvation
[1:04:41] into the Word of God in other words take
[1:04:45] the Word of God and see our experiences
[1:04:53] how are we gonna wind up like Judas
[1:04:56] they'll go good for a while and then
[1:04:59] leave that's our choice
[1:05:06] Jonah 2 & 9 says salvation is of the
[1:05:09] Lord okay I accept what he'd done for me
[1:05:18] but you know the way I live and where I
[1:05:21] act will determine whether or not he is
[1:05:24] accept didn't they what about it come on
[1:05:35] musicians what about it
[1:05:43] is your salvation holding you now here's
[1:05:46] the point we end with it's not where are
[1:05:49] you hold on I ain't know a day whether
[1:05:56] you hold on it's whether or not he hold
[1:05:59] them and remember he'll hold on as long
[1:06:03] as you keeping it work then if you stop
[1:06:06] keeping his word whose fault is it right
[1:06:12] whose fault is it it's our fault let's
[1:06:16] stand together thank own salvation
