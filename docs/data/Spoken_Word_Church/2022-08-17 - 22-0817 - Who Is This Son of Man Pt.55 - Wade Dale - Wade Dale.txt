51-0729A  THE.RESURRECTION.OF.LAZARUS_  ERIE.PA  SUNDAY_
«  E-67       †        Then God told Aaron... Now, He said, "Now, don't try to keep any of that over. If you keep it over, it'll spoil."
That's what's the matter with a whole lot of the Pentecostal people. You keep it over. "I had an experience twenty years ago." Brother, that experience has got wiggletails in it today. What about right now?
You say, "When I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I had joy, peace, and suf--longsuffering." What about now? That experience back there is done gone. What about a new one today? Each day they gathered new manna. And a manna is a perfect type of the Holy Ghost coming from God, the Sustainer to take them through the wilderness, as the Spirit is the Sustainer for us today to take us through this journey. We're on our road to the promised land. Is that right?
"In My Father's house is many mansions. If it wasn't so, I would've told you. And I'll go and prepare a place for you." Is that right? We're on our way to the promised land.
Notice. And we're fed daily by the Holy Spirit coming down from God out of heaven, sweet to our souls like honey in the rock. I have to have it every hour of my life or I die. That's true. It has to come to me or I can't live. It'll come--have to come to you or you won't live. That's right.

JOHN 1:1 & 14
»     1     †      ¶  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
»     14     †     And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

I THESSALONIANS 4:4
»     4     †     That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 

ROMANS 12:2
»     2     †     And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God....

you just be with us in the furthermount of this service lord you be the active participant you be the one who does the speaking and the one that does a revealing father i pray that you just be with each one that's sick not with us be with the ones lord that are traveling myself brother bob different ones that are traveling in june and regina different ones lord we pray that you be with them thank you for bringing the ones that were traveling back home to us lord we pray now that you just sanctified for this journey lord we've all had our hands up lord with many requests and i pray lord that each request will be mentioned not so much mentioned by the word being preached of that exact word but as the word goes forth someone will catch something and say that ain't nothing but the truth and then you can take that and and hold on to it and take it with you in your daily walk lord thank you for all the things you've given us forgive us of our sins and bless us in jesus name amen john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and first thessalonians we were talking about sunday we'll get back on to this i was thinking about something a couple days ago about continuing on and i haven't got ready to get to start with the virtues because that big old thing down there says faith and it's a big old wide foundation so we're gonna have to preach a little bit wider a little bit wider foundation to get where we need to go before we can have virtue before we can have the knowledge of god the virtue of god we have to come under a place to where like i say in sunday the holy of holies is where we need to be but we don't need to stay in that holy of holies we got to come back out live our life then we got to go back through that second stage again of justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost as if you never did it you die daily and the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost to make you to make your mind to renew your mind to take it over to the part that where god wants you to see these not in a natural form but in a spiritual form but you got to apply it naturally all right everybody with me you gotta apply it naturally but it comes in a spiritual form because if you look up the word virtue it's just virtue means virtues live a virgin life that's not what it is you can be a virgin every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the virtue of god and that strength coming out of you and dying that i said the virtue of god going out forth from you that means you're born again all right first thessalonians says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel that's what we're doing we're learning how to possess our vessel i hope we all in this in this um 55 parts now we've we've learned a little bit about the new birth we've learned about justification we've learned about sanctification we've learned about about more about the baptism of the holy ghost i've learned more since i've started speaking than i knew before so it's not for just y'all it's for all of us it starts from here and goes back that way that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by what the renewing of your mind not your neighbor's mind not your wife's mind your mind so it's an individual affair with god it's you and god alone in that holy of holies and he has transformed there is no way i don't believe there is no way that uh that a high priest could go in that holy of holies and be the same person when he walked out he was in the presence of something supernatural he was in the presence of something he'd never felt that presence before he was in the presence of something that what changed his life and the life of a nation amen so the renewing of your mind that what that you may prove listen god's going to prove it but he's going to prove it through you he's going to prove his word through you if not it's just dead letters on the page all right nobody with me that you may prove what is that good and acceptable that priest had to be acceptable as he went through he was accepted here he was accepted here he had all the clothes he had to put on and then he was accepted by one man only and that was god in the holy of holies all right good and acceptable and perfect will of god hebrews 4 verse 15 this is where we were looking at the we'll look at in just a minute for we have not on high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need now something changed from that old testament where only one person could go in and the whole nation had to depend on that one person to go in to where now it switched over to where now the curtain the veil has been rent every person that does not go in is doomed all right so something changed so what changed i believe it came in that rod there's a reason that rod was put in that art now we read why it was put in the ark but the bible tells us and we'll read in just a few minutes that we're promised a rod to come out of the stem of jesse a lineage of humanity because i was looking at brother branham in 1955 brother brown said on the message the art he said wood always speaks of humanity so there was the there was the wood wood speaks of humanity so let's look at the only way to get there though is by the new birth you can't jump from the from the curtain on the outside and just jump your way all the way through you can't get in because it's sheltered it's covered it's a secret it's a mystery but that mystery is not a mystery if you've walked through into the number two court if you walk to number three court it's not a mystery anymore christ is the mystery of god revealed he's the one that you got to go meet and once you meet him it shouldn't be a mystery anymore amen so now let's start we know the first stage of this whole thing we've been talking about it for 50 sermons is the birth for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god those people were israelites for you have not received the spirit of bondage against fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry have a father now that's that's baby form all that we've been talking about justification sanctification that's the outer court the inner court the holy of holies you were born again in the holy of holies but you're not going to stay there because now there's a new and living way you're not going to stay there you're going to come out and you're going to declare that you need to go back there you need to go back there you need to have the new birth you need to have what i got amen thereby all right the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god listen that high priest didn't become a high priest when he got to number three it was required he was already a high priest it was required that he started living a better life so he started he had a renewing of his mind he he had his clothes changed hey man he had his clothes changed he had to change from just common clothes and put on the right kind of clothes the right color had to be together it had to be made with holy hands we read it and then he had to walk a certain way where the pomegranates and the bells were holy ding ding ding ding ding ding and everybody was listening to it and when it stopped he was either in front of god or he was dead then all of a sudden you hear him in just a few minutes amazing grace how sweet the sound i bet he came out of that thing not like some of y'all bunch of cypuses he probably come out of there going i've been with god i have met god face to face in there now moses pretty common to him he's meant god lip to ear face to face and he's talked to god all the time but this one individual whether it be aaron whether it be his sons or whether it be different ones the lineage of levite only one guy got to go back in there and he had to go through all kind i was reading it today i think it was that's all the things you had to they didn't just say all right boy it's your year to be the high priest no no no you had to go through stages you had to prove yourself you had to make yourself available you had to do certain things you had to do things right do it the right way because if you didn't do it right what was it it was death it was literal death for them now you and i come to this thing called spiritual death we can be just as alive as we want to and be spiritually dead but that high priest his very breathable human life was in jeopardy if he was wrong when he went behind that holy of holies all right but see by grace he didn't have a sure he had a a grace covering but not like me and you he'd have a grace covering like we have a grace covering we have a grace covering that if we do make a mistake come on people you think if you do make a mistake you're still you're still able to go to the holy of holies you're still able to go behind the veil amen because somebody the supreme high priest went there for you he just laid that grace veil down and like what i said about the the water coming down you know the blood he walked and you to get to it you got to walk through it amen and if children they are the heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together i want us all to be glorified together i was thinking about the uh when we were baptizing sister sharon last saturday i didn't want us i want us all to be baptized i want us all to be filled with the holy ghost and i want us all to be living breathing instrumentalities of god everybody even those who either sat there like this something's gotta stir somewhere but you know what it can't be stirred unless it's planted that's why i want to talk to these people i was listening to another preacher watching the other day you know he was preaching again on the seed and how that all the seeds in genesis were laying in the ground well that's okay that's creation but that's not me i want to be like matthew matthew said a sower went to soul seed the sower was the son of man the only way you're going to get the new birth is know who jesus christ is and he's the one that sows the word it's not that the word was already in you and he just walks up to you and [Music] and this thing comes to life no no why did he tell the parable why did he just tell the parable here stands us a sower and here stands the devil no remember son of man is throwing seed seed is what seed is the word of god he's planting the word of god satan's planting his word god's people's coming up satan's people are coming up they weren't there they had to be sown in you got to have the words sewn in your soul got to come through the outlets up here and then it's what goes into your ground your fertile ground your humanity as we're going to talk about this afternoon for a minute brother bob i couldn't get away from the from the rod i just i just kept listen you know and what you can see all down through here you know even the bible says spare the rod spoil the child but you remember one thing when we get to it we think we think that is a rod of correction how do you correct somebody by jesus christ the rod that came out of the stem of jesse is how you correct your children yeah they need to have a little protoplasmic stimulation as brother brown said that means a spanking and i doubt you ever got one you either you either you either and you either and maybe them four back there was next to ryan may maybe gabby's pretty tough i'm blaming her not you blaming her gabby's going a model couple they keep their kids in line but instead of envying them we that never mind whatever then the nvm we talk about them that's kind of the way the devil is you know you get a holy ghost-filled person doing something right and you always got the devil going yeah but yeah but what so anyway we'll get to it in a minute so justification is what the outer court sanctification is the inner court and then the holy of holies and we'll look at it in a minute is the new birth there's always three is perfection is that correct seven is completion three is perfection so god is perfected and three's the prophet of god tells us there's a three-room house that we live in what kitchen living room bedroom everybody with me all right also there's what justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost we can't do without any of those can't skip one you can be at a certain one but you can't skip one to get to the other how can you be sanctified if god hasn't already forgive you of your past think about it and how can he give you the baptism of the holy ghost if he hasn't got rid of your sin amen he won't dwell in an unclean vessel he's not going to just come and just go i'm in here no there's a process that we have to go through we have to go through we thank god for a prophet that told us what a body was and in five senses and what his spirit was with five senses and what a soul was with faith or doubt one one sense somebody said the soul doesn't have two senses it's one faith or doubt not faith and doubt because until you're born again you doubt everything amen that old critical spirit gosh i hate that thing can't find nothing good about nothing we win a million-dollar lottery and think you should have won the billion dollar one out of court inner court and holy of holies you've got an outer court we'll look at a min an inner court and a holy holies as you go further toward god it gets more secret everybody with me it gets more intimate it gets more close because outer court there's just hundreds of people walking around hundreds of animals being sacrificed and probably hundreds of high a priest then you've got a certain amount of high priest though that go into the next court curtain falls but remember it's got candlesticks it's got shoe bread it's got altar of incense then you've got in a holy of holies you've got one thing you've got one thing but inside that one thing is three things everybody with me inside this one thing there's three things the word the manna which brother brown just said was the top of the holy ghost all right right and your humanity this is what ties you to this whole thing not this this ties you to it wood represents humanity why did they put wood that's not wood that come from heaven that's manna god created that man did not in nowhere in any restaurant has this ever been created brother brown said it had everything you needed everything they needed for their journey and how can lord can you do without the word the ten commandment was the word of god brother brown said the seals god wrote these on a mountain wrote them with his finger and pulled them out and said here take these down there and give them to the people so inside this ark there's three three things everybody with me all right so i give you a new spirit so the second realm or justification you go in there and there's the shoe bread shoe bread altar of incense seven golden candlesticks they had to keep the candlesticks going they would go out so you had to keep it going sanctification the unclean spirit goes out i want us to realize when we get into number two and number three that unclean spirit is we just got to keep it's got to be a daily i was reading back there because i i've got this my mind's on sticks and rods and and stuff like that we'll go back to sister shepard's dream what was coming out of the of the of the top box what was coming out sticks you've still got sticks rods you need to get rid of sticks we need to get rid of sticky things we need to get rid of amen the stick will stick you so i'll give you a new spirit now remember it's not god's spirit until you get to the holy of holies that's where you get god's spirit all right the baptism of holy ghost seeing you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit of the unfaint love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and bite us forever but everybody's all right amen i'm going to drop this down a little bit make it where it won't be so where i can get it in hey move back over there technology is wonderful okay so now that you're not the tire here's the tabernacle so down here you go in we're going to see a picture of it a minute you've got your outer court the altar of sacrifice many many many thousands of sacrifices the bible tells us i believe it's the book of kings when when um you come up to uh solomon solomon's temple that they couldn't even count the sacrifices that were being made because they wanted to do one for this one and have one for this one untold thousands so that outer court was a mess and until you're born again you're a mess but at least you get inside them walls get inside get into that court get into that outer court where there is an altar of sacrifice which was made out of what brother louise brass signifies what judgment device judgment is going on then the lava where they wash off and then they walk into the holy place not the holy of holies because your next step of sanctification you're getting in line for god to give you the holy ghost so you've got to go through that but i want to read you a quote in just a little while but i want you to realize something aaron's rod had to go through that room but it never came to life until it got in that holy of holies the high priest carried that all them sticks you know moses got all them sticks he walked through every court not a one of them done anything but when he went in that holy of holies and laid him down the next day aaron's rod buddy it had to be in front of life before it could have life because listen we were all born dead sticks i'm getting to something here we're all born dead rods and without the holy ghost you're still a dead rod right jesus even became a dead rod we'll read it in just a minute amen so this is now is the most holy place ark of the covenant nothing in there but that ark but inside that ark there was three things she bred i mean not she bread sorry manna and then there was the ark the two tables of stone and then aaron's rod why was aaron's rod mixed in with all that why was there a rod because it had to be something tied with humanity and it had to be dead before it went in there i mean what in the world it would look really rough look up there in the corner you see that green tree that they've kind of got planted out there that'd be kind of rough to pick that tree up you've helped jacob so have i big old roots or something you just don't reach up and pull it out no you get you a big old backhoe or something and you get a forklift and when you pull that thing up a ball of roots comes out this big around now we're going to drag that through the through the holy hole into the holy holy no god requires one rod one person one you because he's gonna do something with you after he's gonna plant you according to psalms one by a river of living water amen praise the lord well i was yeah i had a good one but there's the outer court i like the way they got this little bless his little heart they got a little lamb laying right here a little little figurine laying on the table but that's what it was but it wasn't that pretty i promise you there was red flowing everywhere there was guts flowing everywhere and in your justification you are a mess and listen even when you're born again and come back out when you go through that second second stage of justification you got to go through that same process again because sister shepard was going through that same process again and that right she was already born again brother brown been born again she was standing in pure water brother brown said but but coming out of that pyramid or her life with sticks and trash we still got sticks and trash we're gonna be sticky the prophet of god said until we're finished with this thing but praise god he made provisions that we can get in there and that dead stick can come to life and be a miracle because it it was not planted in there it was just laying in there laying in sin and trespassed you were just laying there you were dead oh yeah you had a cigarette and a beer and you were partying you were alive no you were dead as that dead stick was before it went into that art but you still had to go through that outer court the inner court and holy of holies aaron had those sticks those rods he had to move them through there they no life no life but when he laid him before god when you lay yourself before god there will have to be life come it's got to be the right kind of rod too because there was 11 of them laying there that didn't get it one in a million okay so there's the ark there's the tables of two tables of stone with the message of the hour come on somebody with a message of the hour all right then there was the manna that they eat every day that was their sustaining portion now listen now if you were outside the court and you left it over to the next revival the brother branham said or to the next camp meeting come on somebody or to the next camp meeting it gets wiggle tails but when you take this manna right here they ate it every year it just stayed in the ark they'd reach down and get one of them and that was some if you read tradition tradition says that's some of the original manna that fell in the wilderness way back when it first started falling if you'll read your bible god tells moses gather up a basketful and put it in the holy of holies and he'll never have wiggle tails i've never read a passage of scripture or a quote that had wiggletails in it amen i've had i've read in the passage where i had some wiggle tails but not where god had any wiggle tails he takes the wiggle tails out when he puts it in the holy of holies you know i was thinking today i preached my the first sermon i preached in 1990 i believe it was in november i took a parallel between um moses jesus paul and brother branham if i don't know if you remember or not i think brother dick's already still got the or he doesn't but she sister gail may still have the video of it it was back then it was a vcr some of you who don't know what that is it's a big piece of equipment with a big old thing about that big you slide it in and it tapes like this but anyway i was thinking today i missed the point because here's three correlations with moses paul and brother branham that maybe i mean moses paul moses moses brother jesus moses jesus paul and brother branham moses was connected to a tent jesus was the tent the prophet of god tells us that he stretched his tent over the people paul was a tent maker and brother branham had a dream about a tent a three-room situation just as we're talking about and that's that's what i believe i mean you believe what you want to about the tent i don't think it's a physical tent because the physical tent has never saved anybody a physical putting up a tent no has not saved anybody it's going in that holy of holies yourself in that little room along with god and listen your healing is going to be your salvation not just the healing of your of your infirmities yes god will work that out but you got to be born again amen so they were all connected with the tent so there must be something about a tent because that's what you are you're a tabernacle during the feast of tabernacles what do they do they build a tent or they build a shelter out of what wood wood sticks and you sit in that booth you and god alone in your tabernacle are your little tent now notice these holy places now when you come into the courts the first was the court the outer court next was the altar where the sacrifice was offered to brazen altar then outside of the brazen altar there was a veil hung over where it went to the holy of holies and there was the mercy seat and there were the cherubs that's what i want to get to in our next lesson let's continue on to them now now notice as they entered in the congregation could come there congregation could come there the priest could stand here but just the high priest could go in there now he's talking about out of court in a court holy of holies everybody with me he's either pointing to something or showing something because the priest stands here many priests stand here lest priest stand in here because look sanctification is not for everybody especially when you get up to the higher form of sanctification amen then when you get in a holy of holies listen there's only a certain amount of people that's born again listen the prophet of god said eight was saved by water that didn't type the new birth right that type the souls that made it up the foods version that made it through that went over what over right he said there was one one enoch god took his tent and took it into another dimension that's us one in a million and he had to be dressed a certain way a certain garment had to have a bell and a pomegranate one to another when he walked he had to walk a certain way praise god as he walked he played holy holy unto the lord holy holy unto the lord those bells and pomegranates ringing together holy holy why he was approaching god having the blood of the covenant in his hand what could you imagine if that blood you don't spill it it's got to be taken it with the fingers sprinkled seven times on that altar and then that's when israel sins man you can't be doing this you know why if you're doing this because your life's not right back there come on somebody your life's not right back here if you're doing this up here anointed with certain perfumes his clothes had to be made by holy ghost filled hands registered hands makes his clothes so clothes must have something to do with it the rose of sharon the anointing all poured it on his head and it ran all down his beard and then down over in other words over his whole body he was placing the royal perfume a pomegranate a bell take the blood of an innocent lamb and he look he dares approaching that veil outside he'd die right where he was standing so he had to go walking a certain way and when he went there and offered the blood on the mercy seat once a year and while he was in there he was privileged to see this you kind of glory when the pillar of fire the amber light that came down that led to children of israel he even smoked up the temple so no one could see it the glory of the lord fell till it was all smoked up and he came in himself and went in behind the veil and settled down like i said before there was nothing going on and all of a sudden brother branham he he told us how that came remember he said two times two is four two times two four two times two's fourth he said it comes and accelerates he said when he comes there he is you're in the presence well that's god can't do it any other way he had to be doing it the same way inside there but you have to be addressed a certain way walk a certain way anointed a certain way he was a special person to go in there how the congregation must have envied him you don't have to envy that today you can go back there with yourself by yourself listen if you don't make it do not blame the preacher amen amen i'll amend that too blame yourself when jesus died the temple veil was rent not only a high priest but whosoever will can now have that same anointing of the shekinah glory and walk a holy life holy holy unto the lord and approaching the very presence of god look what through the blood of jesus christ which is now grace not judgment take him lord jesus he lays a sick man he's my brother he's on deathbed right now to die i'm approaching you holy holy unto the lord what for as a high priest what for on behalf of my brother holy holy holy and to the lord there you are your daily walk your daily talk your daily behavior not at ten and two and seven sounds like a dr pepper commercial ten two and six but at ten two and seven it's not just what that is it's 24 as 7. song says 24 7 365 days a year we still have our ups and downs folks but we got to start this this god told us we got to do this and he made a way to do it holy holy one to the lord look no roots of bitterness no nothing else holy holy hole into the lord holy holy holy unto the lord as we begin to approach on behalf of our brother whosoever will may come anointed blood in front of him the blood going before him playing holy holy unto the lord now that was the outer course the holy place and the holy of holy that was god's sanctuary where on earth now remember we told you it was mobile because it didn't stay in one place it wasn't a statue it was a stature and that stature would move that place they would take it apart they would pull those staves out when it was there and they would put those staves in turn around and they would walk that holy of holies out the priest did it not just the congregation but now that's not right now come boldly to the throne of grace come bowling to the ark of the right now this is where we were talking about last sunday talk brother louise was talking about bearing fruit well now that's what we're getting ready to talk about we're going to talk red talk about bear fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering and we're going to call them almonds okay we're gonna call almonds we're gonna talk about ver almond virtue almond knowledge cause that's the fruit that that that tree why was it an almond tree we'll get to that later on why wasn't a willow why wasn't an oak we'll not get to it tonight but we may get to a little bit later just keep digging deep you'll find something but look let's read number 17 and the lord's speaking to moses we know what this is and i was reading where brother branham was talking about it he said god was separating his people out and that's pretty much what's happening because nathan and cora is walking up to moses saying hey they looking up to you a little bit too much they need to be over here going to my church 200 of them i believe it's 250 actually and we know what happened to him so we're not getting into that because listen god has a provided way he is that provided person brother branham was the person we have to listen to to get the revelation to deliver by fifo ministry to the people not filtered from your own ideas william branham than you and then some you understand what i'm saying speaking of the children of israel but remember brother brown said he preached god's provided way of worship there is a provided way and we've got to go that way because we're human beings we're humanity speaking of the children of israel take one of them every one of them a rod according to the house of their father of all their princes according to the house of the father 12 rods we know that's for the 12 tribes now remember where was aaron from he was from the tribe of levi everybody with me so aaron's was the tribe of levi when the stick came up that was aaron's rod and he wrote his name on it right or moses did all right and thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony that's called the testimony because that's a testimony that god was with those people he was with nobody else when that thing got stolen took to another country remember they put it in the in the temple with dagon and they'd walk in and they're gonna be smacked on the ground set him back up come back the next day dagon was smacked to the ground come back the next day and they said get that thing out of here that's kind of like a a christian or a sinner hanging around a christian finally if they don't become a christian they say get out of here leave me alone brother dick says i think i still got it in my pocket that their spirit irritates my spirit i love that i believe i'm gonna quote it again bless brother dick some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons praise the lord sometimes brother dick did irritate us a little bit every once in a while that's okay but it was my demons that it was irritated i guess so and it shall come to pass that the man's rod whom what whom i shall choose god shall choose not moses god shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel in other words he'd heard enough whereby they murmur against you see they were murmuring to moses but remember who was it that he said oh lord they're they're against me and he said i don't they're not against you they're against me all right and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod according to their father's house now remember they were dead sticks they had been cut off you know they had been cut dead sticks and aaron's rod was among their rods and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle witness i don't believe it i don't believe moses turned around said oh i'm gonna put aaron's right over here next to them right up under the ark and i'm gonna put it's a car and ask her over here on this side no i believe he just laid him down because god's not that way he's not partial he gives everybody a chance but he knew and it came to pass on tomorrow moses went to the tabernacle and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was butted and brought forth buds and blossomed bloom blossoms and yielded almonds you know these are almonds these are not green baby almonds that it produced it produced edible almonds that day these were almonds that were ready to harvest what a mighty god we serve and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord and to all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the lord said unto moses bring aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmuring from me that they die not so there's the rod but let's go to psalms 23. psalms 23 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake yet though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fill for no evil for what for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now rod is giving forth my staff they comfort me now rod is given for authority all right sepulcher or separator not sepulcher like a death place for death but a septum scepter thy rod and thy staff they comfort me not kill me they comfort me psalms 89 if they break my statutes and keep not count my commandments then will i visit their transgression with a rod what with the word with jesus christ think of the rod as christ that's christ that was in there that's his humanity we're going to see a few minutes from now that he was cut off from the land of the living he came a dead stick and he died a dead stick but all on resurrection morning what an almond then i will visit their transgression with a rod and their iniquity with stripes proverbs 13 verse 24 he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasing him many times foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but what the rod of correction he is not talking about an old-fashioned hickory switch if not then uh all the other times that that we got whipped with um hairbrushes and knives and belts and everything else wasn't scriptural you had to go get rod that's not what he's talking about the rod of correction what the your humanity that has blossomed how do you correct your children how's the best way to correct your children live the life in front of them live the life in front of them yeah we got to holler at them and scream at them and try to smack them every once in a while but what is better god smack you like that all the time no he gives you a rod of correction what does he do he gives you this right here and you have to take this and put it in your humanity and if you will i promise you this has got life in it it will bring your old dead stick to life don't have to be planted but what's going to happen after he makes your dead stick cup to come to life we're going to read it in just a minute he's going to plant you everybody with me genesis 2 9 and out of the ground may the lord god now look we're going all the way back to genesis and remember the prophet of god told us in genesis 2 7 i didn't bring it but you ought to know that when when god that genesis 1 26 man when he put it in into adam the 2-7 man what did he say come on he said it looked like his toes were roots and he was a tree planted in the garden of eden but he was in his humanity so he could walk around symbolism he was he came out of the ground he was what he was attached or connected to the ground everybody with me he was connected to the ground but watch this and out of the ground may god the lord god to grow every tree what that was it was they were attached they were attached to the earth but somewhere that's got to be pulled up because we didn't come the way we were supposed to come we were supposed to come to tree of life look the tree of life also in the midst of the garden who did brother brown say that was jesus christ the branch the rod but what happened we turned that down and we came off the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen which was also stuck in the ground satan is stuck in your ground until you get him out isaiah 11 1. i love this because what a what a uh what a promise and there shall come forth a what a rod out of the stem of jesse in other words jesse's lineage if you'll understand what i'm saying it was mail it was coming out of him it was coming forth it was issued up from jesse do you know who jesse was who was jesse jesse was the son of ruth and boaz david's grandparents but he's not talking about david here he's talking about jesus christ so there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall what grow out of his roots so in other words he's got to come to earth and plant himself in the ground listen jesus christ didn't come from this earth he came from his own earth so he was cut off from your earth come on somebody and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding you say oh that's jesus that's you we know he did all this we know we came to all this we know he's the rose of sharing the lily of the valley but i thought we were heirs enjoying ours with this guy i thought whatever stick he got we got whatever rod he got we got whatever fruit he got we got amen one day y'all might get happy and the spirit of counsel look the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord to me that's the statue of a perfect man and shall make him what quick understanding and the fear of the lord some of us don't fit that me either the quick understanding and he's look he shall not judge after the side of his eyes woman where are your accusers because if you're going back in this story just a little while we didn't go back far enough we went to boaz and ruth are you going back a little bit further a generation before that there was a involved rahab yeah hmm so you didn't see through these eyes did we but we see through god's eyes the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the lord it shall make him a quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness he shall judge the poor and repu reprove the equity for the meek of the earth and look he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth the word of god listen the word of god was put in there by god himself but he put a rod in there he put a rod in there with the word in it right what made that rod blood the word that was in there made that rod the word that was in there made that rod bud the word that was in you makes you a rod blood he shall my look the saints will judge the earth listen if you don't get anything from this sermon that ride was you surely it was jesus christ but he was cut off he was cut off so he could die believe that let's read isaiah 53 this is my fist don't stir you stir you just don't stir yet who has believed i report and to whom is the arm of the lord reveal for he shall grow up now wait a minute grow up means he was planted somewhere this tree didn't grow up at first it was growing everybody with me it was growing but it got cut off that means it died for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and has a root out of dry ground in other words he had to come down here come through the womb of a woman and be planted on this earth because that's the way you came you were planted here by your mom and your daddy everybody with me so he had to be planted the rod out of the stem of jesse humanity genealogy he had to come that way through a male not through joseph through god who was a male anybody with me remember brother brown said he said he said if you're born of a woman you'll die he says if you're born a man you'll live come on somebody if you're born of a woman you'll die if you're born of a man you'll live and he shall grow up before him as a what a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he had no form of commonness he probably wasn't the prettiest rod or stickers tree in nazareth any good thing come out of nazareth that looks kind of crooked i don't see anything i like about that when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him the most beautiful thing that man ever done is not make a nice picture of himself it was he died the most horrible death anybody ever died that's the most beautiful thing that ever happened on the face of the earth and it happened on the earth because he was planted in the earth but he had to be plucked out listen i'll show you right here as a root out of dry ground he shall he has no form or commonness when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire he is despised and rejected of men listen we we love the heirs and join ourselves that's you too you got to bear this you'll be despised and rejected of men you'll be a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we hit it as it wears our faces from and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our grief he became an ugly stick so you could be a pretty one you sit there look at me all you want to but there's still to be something stirring in your soul so this is you guys i know we're talking about jesus christ you know what this is talking about but that's you yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god i'm sure the high priest stood there and said he's being he's being um tormented by god for the way he is because we have god is our father who is this guy all just they didn't know that he was that rod that came out of the stem of jesse he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed all we are like sheep have gone astray we in that outer court just running everywhere we have turned everyone to his own way boy in that laodicea my way or the highway and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed this depresses me to say this he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth bless god i'll get him no he knew his word would and if that rod of judgment it's not jesus christ it's you the saints will what judge the earth by what by the rod of correction that rod you are that's why brother louise i couldn't get away from this rod man i just could not get away from it because it's you it's not just a dead stick that was laying an ark he was taken from prison and from judgment look and who showed it i preached on this many times who shall declare his generation with a tree that's planted there's a genealogy almonds ground tree almonds ground tree almonds ground tree almonds not so with this man who shall declare his generation for he was cut off he was made a dead stick he was made a dead rod but all when it got put in the ground amen on easter morning what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is almonds were blooming almonds were being born the fruit of the spirit walked out and said all heaven and earth all power's been given unto me i'm not a dead stick anymore i'm alive and i'm here to plant these people back in the ground because everybody has come through a woman has died folks my blood pressure was 145 over almost 90 a little while ago but i'm feeling good right now who shall declare his generation i will plant me lord amen just plant me i come un-plan i come uprooted i come cut off i couldn't get back to you so you came cut off you came smitten afflicted whacked off despised hey listen come on we love beautiful branches and trees and right we love well i don't like crap crape myrtle i don't like them at all never mind let's put roses roses are good crape myrtles are horrible thank you sister they poop everywhere but anyway but it's the plan of god okay so it's okay but you see now walk to a garden it's all live stuff right all beautiful but when you went to god's garden that morning before the resurrection everything was dead there was just stick sticking up but that was the most beautiful thing because he was getting to resurrect coming to resurrect and he was going to resurrect you and me take you out of the earth you were planted in the earth that you had nothing to do with but you had to come that way you had to come plant it into the ground but planting got in the ground though when you come to the age of accountability you got cut off you got cut off from god you became that dry stick that dry rod and there's no way you can get that back listen if you take one and cut it off and graft it it's got to be alive but you can't take a dead stick and graft it to a live tree won't grow because what there's no life you had no life that's right brother you are a dead stick sticking up in humanity he was cut off out of the land of living he came here planted you know what happened man cut him off man cut him off the greatest religious people in the world cut him off they hewed him down they put him on a tree and said we'll get rid of this guy oh he's dead now let's make sure let's roll that big stone they could have put stone mountain and all the rocky mountains together on top of that grave and that would not have held that man because he had life for the transgression of my people was he stricken he was cut down for me and you because he knew you were cut down and if you're his you're gonna have to be planted and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he hath done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth what a man yet it pleased the lord to bruise him why because he could see his seed you when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper he must have planted this somewhere a dead stick does not prosper what i do with that stick now put it back all right we'll leave him in there he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand look he shall see the travail of his soul what that's where the life of the plan is it's in the soul he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied this is good by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify wake dale for he shall bear away dale's iniquity because i was born a dead stick a dead rod no way back couldn't bring forth fruit you can't get fruit i never did right branch john 12 23 now watch him prove what he's going to do and jesus answered and said the hours come that the son of man this is the hour that the son of man is to be glorified fairly fairly i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if if it die can't do that naturally it's got to have some life in it it bringeth forth much fruit on the day of pentecost was 120 little almonds then 3 000 little almonds came budding god started planting them because what this is the promise of god folks blessed is a man that walketh not the council of the ungodly nor standing in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted planted to bring forth life planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season you and i are bringing forth fruit in this season a measure of faith faith for the time this offense together and bringing forth his fruit and deceit his leave shall also not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but they are like chaff what is chaff jeff is something that's been cut down amen they're coming to a time where they're going to be harvested which the wind the wind of doctrine driveth away matthew 15 verse 13 says but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up romans 6 4 therefore we are buried with him in baptism we read this in the baptism that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been what planted together in the likeness of his death we all show we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection amen a dead stink did not walk out of that grave he was fixing to bear almonds 11 days later he started bearing almonds peter stood up on the day of pentecost and said have you took of this tree yet have you eaten these almonds that we got have you protected this holy ghost esau shall be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed and henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin let's read a few quotes if you don't mind just for a minute 1955 a hidden life you ought to read this or listen to this message in this same place we don't have much time because they got a hurry but just for another thought in this same place they put aaron's rod to make a decision who god had chosen and who he hadn't are you with me and that rod that was a dead stick in one night's time at an altar somewhere in lula georgia or anywhere you come from there was a decision made and one night's time came to life brought buds brought flowers brought almonds if both come to life bro blossoms yield fruit a very typical pattern of the sinner being brought to god into the holy place remember that rod watch this this is where i got this from remember that rod passed over every one of those other elements right the the laver the the brazen altar aaron had to carry it right by them it goes into the into the holy place and there's some pretty good stuff in their sanctification you know getting clean set aside for service you got the candlesticks you got the shoe bread you've got the altar of incense didn't bloom a had to thing in the right place i had to get to the holy holy see that's the problem that's the problem with the foolish virgin they stop at this court they got their rod but it's dead because remember without the holy ghost you're dead so they didn't get the holy ghost they got in a position but they didn't go all the way in if they went all the way in their rod would have started budding everybody with me on this it never came to life when that rod passed every one of those other elements that got inside the holy place still dead remember the holy place is the second not the not the holy of holies the second one all right sanctification good place to be bad place to what stay it never came to life when they first brought it in there that's the reason the holy spirit watched you since you received the holy ghost see your attitude toward his kingdom wow if it's been selfish motive if the things that you've thought of has been in furthering a denomination boy or if it's doing farther better you your position if it's to make you a man that i me me i prayed for that person and they i pray i thought god get the glory if it well i'm just reading brother brown said if you want to better your position better you if it's to make you a man looked up to in the world if it's to build you a big church somewhere bob build your kingdom there's a story behind that bob sent us up with you that sent us where that preacher was the denominational preacher he was boy he was letting people in the back have it you know how they were building their own kingdom well he was tearing them up on youtube so we talked about building kingdoms but look build you a big church somewhere or some popularity or some other thing outside of increasing or in bettering the kingdom of god brother something's wrong something's wrong now when that old dead rod was brought in there and laid in the presence of god himself what happened it budded it blossomed it yielded through showing that we were born in in other words born in sin that rod was off of an almond tree and when it was cut off it died you and i were cut off we died but when a man was cut off from god he died spiritually but once brought into the place of god before the presence of god he comes to life and yields life yields fruit yields blossom yields fruit power of decision 1955. put aaron's rod in there old dead almond tree but as it went under the shekinah glory everything it was was restored again back to that genesis 1 26 back to the garden of eden that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the shekinah glory of the holy spirit the veils drop behind him everything that he ought to have been a son of god blooms out in him again let's stand our feet i could keep on going but we'll stop right there i'll read this one musicians come on they took aaron's rod and laid aaron's rod in the presence of this holy place and when they did in one night's time it budded blossom yielded almonds in one night's time think of it in the presence of god this old dead rod this old dead rod lying there in the presence of god blooded blossom yielded almonds in one night what was it then what kind of a rod was it it was an almond tree rod that's what he'd taken it from the stick was off of an almond tree and you are a stick some kind you think i got this just out of my own head i had a quote for it the stick was off of an old almond tree and you are a stick some kind and you was taken off the branch of humanity which was god's created son in the beginning you may be fallen dead alienated from god but by that in creation you were created to be a son of god you were created to be an almond tree but you got cut off so god had to come down here and get cut off for you you may be falling dead alienated from god but by that in creation you were created to be a son of god you may bounce around and be respected and honored out here in the courts but if you ever get in that glorious place and hide away with god you'll yield what you're supposed to do live the church let it out yield what you're supposed to yield all of us are going to anyway all of us are god bless you let's sing a song there's power in the blood power in the blood full of victory wind there's wonderful power in the blood there is power power [Music] there's life there's life that'll come into that old dead stick if you'll just let him [Music] in the blood [Music] there is power [Music] that you gave
