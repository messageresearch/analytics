him good to see everybody in the house of the Lord be like turning your scriptures turn back where we read this morning and we'll try to have them comments and questions so you get everything ready and just remember to pray one for another and we keep praying for our wife in this time of a problems with the working that knee and things because it's got to be done to be able to make it better for later on you know so it's a hard thing to do but we thank everybody for praying and all that's been done amen Hebrews 11. now remember the announcements remember the ministers meeting will be this coming Saturday to the Ministers of it brother Bill yountz and then remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother Christian's on the 20th so remember that and keep these in mind you know of these meetings and the different things I think that's the main announcements but just keep them all right father we thank you for your love and your grace and kindness we thank you for everything we know and realize that without you there's no hope whatsoever for any of us we just pray that you would help us and guide us now and forgive our sins the thoughts of our minds the things that we think about that are contrary to you and things Lord of life it is not according to you and Walking In Your Love in Your Grace we just ask you father to help us and keep us fill us with love and understanding forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace Lord Just Have Your Way in Jesus name amen okay Hebrews 11. now Faith is the substance to things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it what by faith the elders obtained a good report all right now but then Paul would get on over and he'd say verse 13 of Hebrews what did he say these all died in faith having not received the promises right then he drops over to the 39th verse and he says in all these having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise that you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I pray that this part has been at least an eye-opener to you to help you to understand and you know that we spent a lot of time and doings in it but uh I pray that it would help you but my point was in this morning you know we had some company different things and so you kind of change things a little bit but so you get ready for your comments and your questions about what we're talking about but what has been the theme of what we've been speaking of is for you and I not to necessarily look back and recognize you know everything and see everything and that's well and good you know because that's the background but to recognize and see who we are and what we're doing here because our Point has been what that uh no one in the Bible or no one of anything has ever amounted anything without a positive attitude you know to be positive about it be you know be certain about it and uh you know it will turn out in the correct way if we put the right mind to it because the prophet would say write me in latitude toward any promise so bring it to pies well but recognizing all of those and seeing all of those down through the Bible and then coming down to the end time to talk about the prophet and the the signs and the Wonders and the things that that you know has taken place or did through the ministry and then uh you know if that's all we can talk about then uh you know I believe we're missing the theme of the whole thing I thought all of that was to build up our faith into realizing Who We Are all right and then as I've emphasized now a couple of messages that Paul talks about these obtaining you know the position but then turned around and says they didn't Attain well that's you know that sounds kind of a little contradictory but it's true they did attain unto what God promised them for the day they were living in the time all right and then in doing that see that's a great faith Builder for you and I that we can look back and see they did a Time but then also to realize that there was something they didn't attain them to you know and to see that we would have something to do with the ending up or bringing them to a completion or Perfection not as we try to make them perfect but as a completion or a finish of what they should have done but to see and I hope you follow that line that as we ended up at the end this morning through their unbelief the mercy of God was extended to you and I know all right then and the point was that if that brings Mercy to you and I why wouldn't we have mercy for others all right and in doing it that we would have a a park to do with this you know by them turning down did you follow the thought whether you believe it or not just let you just have to pray anyway because I can't reveal it but to know that they turned down the gospel Israel all right and we accepted it right what if we had not have accepted it where would we be all right but what if they have accepted it where would we be all right so then it's a wonderful opportunity for you and I to be able to understand the whole layout of the Bible and to see doing it but see then everything points to you and I because all before us could not be made perfect Without You and I now could not be made complete could not be brought to a end of what they were supposed to have been brought all right and I don't have that wording I don't know how the education to express it just my own thoughts but when they turned down the gospel and the Gentiles received it it put Israel in a blinded state all right and when it did you and I would be able to run that into the prophet's message and study it just look so you say no no no Israel God didn't blind Israel brother Ryan said God put his hand over Israel's eyes he blinded them why because he knew we would come in now don't you think don't you think that God would have the ability to enter into um a person and explain what he wanted to come on now don't you believe God would have that ability I believe he could take a dog and make it do what he wanted it to do all right you know but see if you'll study on it you'll find the prophet saying that when Jesus kept saying son of man I was just looking at it a moment ago you know he said Israel couldn't understand that because they they couldn't comprehend you know why he would say son of man all right and that was the secret that was hidden down through all of the ages and came out in the end time with this prophet in probably 1947 when he first started you know that we out of the records of the tapes that recorded that he probably mentioned son of man then you know but do we understand it because he said that Israel was blinded because of him coming exactly the way the word City would come all right so now sure there was a lot of people that blinded their own selves this agent where we're at the Gentiles the biggest portion of the people are blinded to the truth right because it came the way that he came right we were talking about it last night in the Bible study I know maybe my mind is all I don't know maybe I'm just gone wacky studying the word of God but leave me alone I'm happy I may be wacky but I'm happy all right we were talking about last night what do you think about the 300 ministers who questioned brother random about the water baptism you remember when he got to explaining it they said we want the tapes we are going to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we want those tapes for the people he said not one minister now I was expressing it to him last night do you think those 300 preachers went home and taught their people about water baptism I don't think they did you know I don't think the water baptism was mentioned that away if it was it was mentioned in the point that we proved him wrong we're going to stay with father-son Holy Ghost see they were blinded blinded to the truth well you know what that done to the people blinded to people right all right and like us telling them it took a a man with like brother Brandon with no education of things and I know you've heard me say this hundreds of times but when brother moat said why do you believe about the godhead I said God in three persons Blessed Trinity he said you're a trinity like everybody else I said explain yourself sir he said you're a father you're a son you're a human but there's not three people of you there's only one we're talking about dire in the scriptures where it says even the Eternal godhead could be understood by the things that you see what about how simple brother random could make it explaining a father a son and the Holy Ghost as a father a human being a person a and you being one but because of our educated mind you know what that done that blinded people right to the truth what we've been taught is what's blinding us right Israel had it figured out as I said this morning this group had it that way this group had it done with that group had one and because he didn't come that way they were blinded to the truth but you know what he came exactly the way the word said he would come now is it true that according to Malachi 4 that we were promised in the last days a prophet would come is that true you know and you know what by coming the way he come people wouldn't have it but if he'd come as a great Billy Graham or Robert's great compromiser they would have accepted it but because of him being the way he was it blinded the people and they wouldn't have it but you think about it Church I got this message I was going to preach it this evening but I had we better stay with the comments and questions a little bit but I wish you would think about it until next weekend Lord willing to fail what's the greatest thing of sin what's the greatest sin you could think of I wish you would just put that down and think about it for a week what is the greatest sin you could think of when we know it's not drinking gambling smoke and run around with women homosexuality perverts it's not that brother Dale I've not sinned in 40 years you know but I just don't believe that you're talking about that one God I just don't believe it when you're the biggest sinner there is to think on those things but think about what happened to Israel and it blinded them by him coming the way he said he would come then wouldn't it end up in the same way to the Gentiles by him saying the way he'd come and he came that away that it would blind again some are blinded willingly all right and some of natural Israel back there were blinded willingly because even gamelion in Nicodemus you know gamaya would say you better leave this alone if it be of God you're fighting God if not it'll come to all you know not it'll come no good and you know what what if we are that blind today but what do you mean brother Dale we studied the message we do why are there so many different doctrines from the one message what don't you think that brother so-and-so had the right to believe what he wants to sure that's the Constitution says it but the Bible don't there's no scripture in the Bible it says it's one Faith one Lord one baptism one God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ right but that's just the way he sees it all right I believe in was asked the question about it I believe in everybody I I don't believe everybody believes you know is identical no we sat down and talked we're going to find a place that we don't agree you know what are we going to split and refuse to listen to the other person if we do we made a denomination because we denominated we die all right if you see blindness then is covered in a lot of ways some are willingly blind willingly ignorant the Bible says but some are blinded because God done that but get to point that it's not that God just oh this blinds you that's not I mean I don't I don't look at that away he said I'm going to come the way the word says I'm going to come you're going to have it figured out your way and that's going to Blind you but said the Gentiles will accept it and that will preserve you to a time that I'll come back to you but he'll never marry Israel back as bride I want any word you can show that in the Bible the prophet's message he won't marry him back his bride because they rejected that and by not being bride they won't be sonship you know they rejected sonship but he gives them a place I've studied the message for all these years and even like the fifth sealed Jew the only thing I can find is one thing where brother around and said they are given white robes under the seventh seal you remember the scripture where they're giving white robes and told to wait a while you know and uh he said under the seventh seal we'll see I don't I don't know what that means do you you know but they are given you and I are not given white robes our white robe is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's given unto us as a new birth but it's not there later foolish virgins are given eternal life one day but they don't have it now yet they confess it and they die believing it right so then we're in a vast time and a vast doing but I want to make this these few comments and then but have you ever thought about the promises made for this age do you realize if we are the end of all things you know we don't worry about time do we we're not concerned about when we're concerned about what's taking place you realize then that we're promised in this day this is the greatest day that has ever been running around and said if I stood Before Time and God asked me where would you like to live it should have been good in certain ways and certain times but he said let me live down here look but brother there just ain't nothing going on you know I mean nothing's going on we don't see no signs and wonders no wonder I'd run around and said it wouldn't wasn't meant for you well not the way he said it it wasn't meant for you all right but you see we look at things in our own way but yet the promise is made for this age if it was no more than to read Hebrews 11 40. according to my understanding of the English language when you would read that you'd say God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect well you know what that means everybody from here back is that English is that just reading well no it meant for so long here and our salvation is tied to everybody in the world right then everybody's waiting on us well the promises is down here then I would love to live there when Jesus walked on the shores of Galilee wouldn't you sure but you know what I'd have been just like everybody else I'd have been blind as a bat so would have you oh no I would have understood it oh yeah no you'd have been blind it's been on the wrong side we would have been choosing Judas as the great guy right is that the way the prophet said he would have been chosen over the other but what about the promises of this day I'm going to say that and I want to read a couple of quotes and then you get your your uh your questions or comments or whatever go ahead brother if you will pull up number three but I told him I didn't know which way it's going this evening so we'll go this way look at number three on you notes there which is taken from paragraph 367 through 371 of the stature of a perfect man and that's number three now that we're still on the conduct I mean the comments and questions brother like I said I got both Stacks here okay you want to go all evening we'll just stay here and we'll see the Sun go down uh I wouldn't do it would it well look what brought around says now you get it these who these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection now that kind of looks like it's dependent upon somebody reaching perfection right and look at you goes back and and they're sold under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come he explains it getting smaller doing how it works and how that it comes but I'm just interested in the promises go to the next one number four this has taken what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 51. they didn't underline it I didn't underline this for them so I'll have to pick the spot but when we need it we're at what's he doing he's pouring in his spirit and those who are resting out under in the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture said or crying how long how long how much longer God's waiting on me in you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the Dead and we're going to rapture the promises for this hour promises to you and I look at number five which assured we would see Jesus e 13. we're living in the day that the Gospel made many great promises for this day now is those promises true and if they are then we should live by them if they're not true we should get away from them and find out what is true now for me to walk out here today and tell you look how close it could be I'm expecting in the last days of worldwide sweeping Revival that's part truth but yet it's wrong it's not true why because we're not promised a worldwide sweeping Revival said that's where people miss it looking at that seeing the two witnesses to Israel and thanking it's for us no but what if the promises for this day I got a little message I'll probably preach on that note get a little time what about a Revival oh yeah you could say Revival's over brother Dale wrote around and said that he said the United States turned down the gospel in 56. Revival's over but then he'll turn around and say that the people that failed to see The Awakening of the Bride see then they can be a Revival to the bride which would be individuals but no Revival to the world right and like I've told you ever since I came in this message I've been in a Revival I told you the other day you ought to think about it wrote around the one that said this he said every time a Revival went forth he said insane asylum is filled up that's what he says you're checking well you know they're kind of full right now so there must be something going on right right let it begin in me all right so let's find out whether it's true or not we're to have a Revival for ourselves in the message and the continuing that's true what a worldwide sweeping Revival is not to the Gentiles now we know what truth is okay going to the next one just the promises the presence of God unrecognized and look what he says paragraph 118. so many things look at this days what he said would take place look at the promises that he made would take place this day and then examine it of what is going on and see where we're at and you see whether he's still in his word or not they wanted to see the sign of Moses son of David and all of them but those things showed clearly right wrote on up just a little bit what day they were living in what day each one Moses David whatever was written in the Bible right and they've seen their declare day because they've seen it manifest and they wrote it what about you and I he's doing the same thing right now search the scripture you who believe the Bible what is supposed to take place right here before his coming it was promised that the word for each age well then we must have a word for this age but have we recognized that the world is waiting on us God is waiting on you and I right God is waiting on somebody to realize who they are now we'll never do that by trying to find out how goody goody we can be I love the way God talks so wonderful when you really understand the way he's saying it you know that Moses had a lot of failures smiting the rocks and the different things have you ever read when he called Josh you would have started his ministry you ever read that as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee I read that one day and I thought what a God he was simply saying Joshua I'm going to take you through the failures of Moses never hindered the promise neither will your failures hinder the promise come on that's where we're at you know you go out there right now and say son go down it will it's going to take a few hours Sean Sam Steele no those are not for the day that we're living those were for the day that God used them you and I have a promise in this day to take this message and bring forth the Dead from the grave of course now they've got it figured out they got this about brother Branham to do this they got this about other ministers to come and do this they got this about waiting on so-and-so to do this they're waiting on this out of the other everybody's got it figured out I'm not going to argue with you about you figuring out I'm just going to say one thing for sure the Bible doesn't say that we're waiting on brother random to come back I believe you will thank God for it I've explained that over and over to you he's got a 30 40 days he can preach all he wants to from the time of the Resurrection I have no problems with anybody that believes in all kind of doctrines like that my problem is is when you won't open your eyes and look at what's taking place that's what we just read to see what's going on the Bible says without us they cannot be made perfect the prophet said God is waiting on you and I right we said it on one thing of event to take place we have narrowed that down to the wrong place I think when we put it to the word of God and believe that the world is waiting on you and I to realize Who We Are all right let me give me one more that I didn't give them because I've quoted this a lot to you but it's taken from if they pick it up and put it up they can get it uh page 15 of the church age book The revelation of Jesus Christ you started by now remember this so they're running in dark you can run it in today what hey they beat me to it don't they and remember this Christ in his true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works what's his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit Discerning withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her it's like he was with the Lord Jesus by him knowing who he was but I just can't see that brother Dale of how that we can be what we are and we can do the Greater Works now there's messages all over the land on what the Greater Works are but think about it I thought that we believed then as I've brought out in the last two or three messages or a little maybe for a long time that when God wrote about Abraham he never wrote about any of his problems when you wrote about Sarah he didn't write about any of his problems I'm talking about in the New Testament through Paul he said he's staggered not well then you say we can never attain unto this statement here well that means you can't Attain but if that statement's true they may not be but one person but somebody is going to stand in that place and why can't I contend that I am that person right so then everything is dependent upon whether or not somebody can take this word and walk right up to death and life at it and say move on I'm going on we look no we can't do the Greater Works then you get hung up trying to figure out what Greater Works are we know we can't do nothing greater I need to see come on Church there's the 500 preachers a 300 preachers that went home and taught their church not the correct form of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but taught them that brother random was a false prophet and they wind up to be blinded you'll find there's the greatest sin is to say I can't do it but you know what most people justify that you can't do it right I don't see that in you do you ever see it in yourself if you don't see it in somebody else you've got to have a way of saying that ain't right you got to have some standard to judge by right when you say I don't see it you got a standard to judge by so you must be the standard like I've always said there's no such thing as an atheist that don't believe in God there's idiots because they believe they're greater than he is because if I say there's no God I've got to be greater than he is or I wouldn't say there is no God what about it what are you expecting brother Dale just what the prophet said in one of the quotes that Jesus Christ would become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we'd go into rapture I don't see it well do you mean it's not true I've never been up in a spaceship went into them Mars and things or anywhere else and you who was it talking about that the other day but Joe I guess you were talking about that they say that there's a son out there on one of those solar systems out in there that you know I forgot how many years it would take a jet airplane the thing is so big till it would take a jet airplane flying at top speed he told how much it was was like years to be able to fly around a sucker and we think we're big well I've never seen it I don't believe it's out there I've never been healed so I don't believe healing is for us you'll lay on your bed one of these days and you'll beg for somebody to try to convince you that there is a healing I just pray it's not too late my whole point of this whole series was aiming at this life part all those great warriors of faith and what they've done and then Paul says they didn't receive the promise so there's something greater for you and I to bring them to their promise and it's a simple matter we just become what God said we would be is that hard to become what he says we would become because if he said we would become it somewhere he's going to make a way is that true it's up to him to save us because we can't save ourselves right then it's up to him to keep his promise what's your problem is see we can hinder the promise we can't stop it we can hinder it and then by doing that we can prove we're not a part of it right all right questions and answers comments take on these things Brother Gary hang on a minute we got to get to things we will we want you on the thing too we're people can hear you maybe they got the same question go ahead brother you've uh mentioned many times in the past several sermons and today uh about they without us cannot be made perfect well as you know there is a teaching that believes that there is Those Old Testament Patriarchs that raised in that Resurrection when Jesus resurrected there that they did go on and receive the end of their promise which was an eternal body and there's even quotes about Brenna made sure that sound that that's what's being said and could you spend just maybe a minute or two just going over those the other side quotes and kind of bringing the the truth of what you believe down through the middle of all of it like I said this morning it's easy to think about the New Testament Saints and kind of see how they're depended upon us because we're all in a body but then the things before you know the ones in the Old Testament I heard a man just recently in a meeting that he was expressing just that point he said that the blood of Jesus Christ made those Old Testament Saints so perfect until he went right in the presence of God well what is the presence of God see is it then that Those Old Testament Saints have totally gone on into immortality if it is you better rip out Hebrews 11 40. because they wouldn't be waiting on us and we wouldn't be waiting on them so there wouldn't be nobody waiting on nothing right I believe Those Old Testament Saints raised I believe that the ones that was in Paradise I believe Paradise was taken up I believe that but where did they go that's all I've ever asked you can get a quote from Brother Branham he went right into the presence of God I believe that you can get a quote where he said open up your left Everlasting Gates the kingdom of Glory come in and he goes right in and takes them right in I believe that all right but where did it go and how did they get to immortality because if they raised in glorified bodies literal physical glorified bodies they went into immortality into Resurrection that's sensible all right where did it go when the Bible says that Jesus is the only one that has immortality which no man can attaining to all right so the thought is the Old Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus to make them perfect good and one brother had it this way and he said that in the church ages they're waiting on us and that sounds real good you know but the only question I've asked is were did those Old Testament Saints Go and run around them went beyond the curtain of time where did he go six dementia right all right he said they were there in their souls theophany sixth dimension I forgot the wording he actually used it something like where's Jesus he said you can't go where he's at he said because he's higher well that's why I don't see that the Old Testament Saints achieved a position that they could go to when even the people who had died in Christ were not allowed to go to that position that there are their bodies here all right I know that I'm facing a lot of questionable things but I've been asked to State it and I will and if I'm wrong then I can be helped because I will tell you what I believe but you'll sit there and sire up and won't tell me what you believe but go tell everybody if I don't agree with brother Dale About That Old Testament Saints well why didn't you come tell me eat it okay but listen when they came up did they come up in glorified bodies right around says they did hmm well we'll say what he said well okay keep on saying what he said you don't never hear of the ones I gave the other day where they brought around and said one day Adam will reach over and get Eve he will reach over and gets Abel able to reaching it saith brought it all the way down to Abraham and said they'll raise up and go up and then you won't go to the Future home where brother random says Those Old Testament Saints will raise in the resurrection and we will fall right in line and go up now to keep you from going too far don't try to Bumble jumble that up and try to get it straightened out I know what I'm talking about on this I never preached it to you but I do know one thing that has to be put in the correct order because remember his secret was fall right in line it doesn't say what order it comes you say yeah he said they raise all right you got Old Testament Saints what are you going to do will you feel sealed you where do they come up and 144 000 are not raised until after we're done in glory right three and a half years later it's the key is fall right in line there will be a resurrection and wrote around and says those in Christ you know what he's talking about Old Testament Saints but they weren't born again no they wouldn't but they were the Christ of their day put all the quotes together put all the message together I've asked this simple question is Revelations 5 a literal group of people or is it a Heavenly scene of not more people but in Revelations 5 you've got 24 elders 12 Apostles to have Patriarchs at the time that was written John was one of the Patriarchs hadn't died yet right so there have been 23 elders right and John would have said and I get there we'll make 24. he didn't say that but I don't believe Revelations 5 is a Corporal mortal people I'm going to give you the quote in a minute worth it it goes to and then maybe it'll open their eyes Revelations 5 is the Lamb that climbs upon the throne and sets down is that Revelation 5 Revelation 4 receives the throne he sees this Revelations 5 he sees one Cloud upon the throne and sit down you know that brother random said when those Old Testament Saints entered into that City now what city is he talking about that's the quote that entered into the city open up your Everlasting Gates that the king of glory may go in may come in he said he went right down through the city he said he went Jesus right up to the father stopped and said father it's finished I have completed this run the quote and say he says climb up on the throne and sit down and I'll make your enemies your footstool where does he come upon the throne and sit down chapter 5. chapter 5. chapter 5 is where he went to the throne he's the lamb that takes the book it wouldn't allow him right you know physical it was Jesus Christ I'm not going to argue with anybody about it but I'm just going to State what I believe I'm the pastor I'm responsible for stating it I believe Those Old Testament Saints I have preached it to you not to try to argue with nobody I believe Those Old Testament Saints when they died their soul was not eternal and that Soul was put in Paradise Paradise would be called the Muslim of Abraham which is the faith of Abraham provided by the faith of Abraham that's Bible right we're the place it was it's just you know and Jesus had to go there and bring those people out but he also went to hell to the souls that were in prison but he didn't bring them out when he brought the Old Testament Saints out I'll let you question it could it be that when they raised that they raised in theophany raised to a Eternal Soul making them capable of going to chapter five and be in the Twelve Apostles and pale 12-page Rock and then it would be that they achieved a place but yet their body's still in the ground and one day there'll be a resurrection and they'll come up that way I don't have to backpedal jump around and bypass quotes I can take every one that is put there run around and said they raised in Mortal bodies I will remind you that he will call a theophany a mortal body he will call it theophany a glorified body keep reading he'll call those by those names but the only thing I've asked you simple question if they raised back there why did Paul spend Hebrews 11. 39 verses talking of the Old Testament Saints and cons I mean finishing it up in the 39th verse as the saying they never received a promise in the 40th verse said because they without us cannot be brought back to a completed stage of mortality because that's totally what he's talking about he's not talking about the New Testament I searched it and searched it brother random and I gave it to you on the Statue of a perfect man that we read is the only time he connects the New Testament saints that I can find you know to that point of anywhere connected in Hebrews 11. because Hebrews 11 was all Old Testament people right well then why would he say that why wouldn't Paul say that they've done been made perfect and a brother explained that like I said the Old Testament Saints was made perfect by Jesus Christ but now the New Testament people are waiting to be made perfect complete finished because of a bride I believe one thing I don't believe Those Old Testament Saints raised in a mortal body to go to immortality because immortality is the position Jesus reached when he was raised from the dead when he was raised in the dead he stepped from Mortal to the immortality and the Bible then is right that no man hath reproached unto that but Jesus Christ if I'm wrong I want you to show me but I want you to show me the message not well this is what I believe well brother Dale you're just too dumb to read well that may be true but bring the quotes and let's read them I've told you when I believe sure they moved out of that place into another place which would qualify him to be in Revelations 5. there's a 24 elders because the New Testament Saints at that time could be represented there as apostles the Old Testament was represented as the Patriarchs and the lamb had a book in his hand he climbed up on the throne and sat down waiting until the life the enemy to be destroyed which is Mortal dying that's the promise for you and I somebody is going to be made Immortal Immortal if I mispronounce it they're going to be made eternal Body Spirit and soul and everybody else will fall right in line because we have achieved it that's what I believe anybody else you come in more comments brother anybody else will say hey I don't agree with you well explain it but the problem is like we were talking about last night like the five of the 300 preachers oh yeah we believe that and I was relating to when Wade and I spoke in a Minister's meeting about the Daniel 70 weeks and for preachers and we had proof of the drawings as being correct we had two one of them was a hand drawed drawing signed by Brother Branham and we had the one that I picked up in 68 in Jeffersonville Indiana as a drawing from what a randomly drawed and he said seven six or seven times in the message referred by Iran is to refer back to the draw and if you got any question you know what a big man in this message you know what he does he made his own drawing and totally changed everything around him said I'm at least not going to be that far off anybody else and they call me as questions talks be glad to answer any question or tell you I don't uh sister Trudy croissant okay my question is for you to explain again um acts 9 7 together with acts 22 9. 97. yeah and 22.9 and 22 9 that was one brother Bob was on Wednesday yes you gotta answer that one ask him I'm not it's a it looks like a total contradictory form because it says in the seventh verse of the nine that they stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man all right then they come over and what is it 22 9. and we're afraid but they heard not the voice of him that Spate to me okay sound like it's contradictory don't it sounds contradictory I wouldn't stand here at all if he had or showed me that I tell you I don't know see so let's read it stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and over here it says they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me that's the key they heard of thunder you're in a voice they heard a thunder they heard something happen seeing no man so he gets on over and he don't talk about the man because they uh they couldn't see the one I remember with the man standing there right it was a pillar of Fire standing there and they didn't see it remember Moses saw the pillar of fire but the children of Israel didn't see it right right see they with a voice one was a thunder you know something happened that would have took you remember into Jesus over there said some said it thundered but the voice spoke to him see those people never heard who's talking to Paul right they never heard who was talking to ball they heard of little blue Bloom some kind of a form of Paul knew who was talking right so the key is you're not looking for the man because they say they didn't see no man no here they don't mention it but it's just talking about a voice well see you can sit here today the whole congregation can hear my voice right but what if there's only one person knows what I'm saying yeah Danny's the only one that knows what to say it you know what he's on one heard my voice the others heard jangling words or sounds or symbols because the key over there is what that what happened but they heard not the voice of him that spake they saw the light that's part of it we'd like to back up to that they were with me so indeed Delight and we're afraid to don't mention a lot in the other so we'll go back to pick up that little point that they thought it was the sun shining down Paul that light spoke to Paul they couldn't understand that but they seeing no man verse 9. what was it what was the other one nine and seven and nine seven speaks this you're in a voice and seeing no man this is over here says they saw a light see they saw no man but it wasn't a man standing there was the Lord Jesus he said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted none of the others heard that right you can hear the voice of God as brother Bob said there I enjoyed it you can hear it every day of your life and not know what's been said you know the Bible never did teach water baptism in Father Son and Holy Ghost you know the Bible never taught a trinity the voice of God is correct but have we seen God or are we looking for a man to try to help us or look into God you understand Sis one says they draw a light the other doesn't mention the light because it means to see no man well there was no man there one says hearing a voice the other one's talking they didn't hear what was speaking to me all right so it's correct they never heard what Paul heard they heard a room they heard that on the day when Jesus was standing there but it had to be interpreted won't say it okay that confused you sometimes I talk enough to confuse people okay okay brother Bob brother dick Oh Me Oh my I do things and I talk to preachers and what have you and I hope they bring things back to me the reason why I talk to them and like sharing with something with brother brothers the other day and he jumped up I said and he said he's never seen that that way my question is about this scripture it seems contrary one to the other and what Abel I can't but is that all you see yeah I was I don't know I've been here since 84 or something like that I was around Atlanta and this happened sometime before then I was sitting in a warehouse rack it's almost reading and I was reading that scripture there and I realized that to me personal to me that that was the second G Jesus was showing Paul the second coming of himself and I believe if we if in this is personal to me me seeing that I know who I am today yeah I believe that people don't know who they are today they're just a quote or something like that but you know Paul held held the clothes of the men that stoned uh Stephen yeah he had no big experience there right but when that happened when that Pillar of Fire said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted I believe he realized who Stephen was and I didn't catch that to about three or four five months ago or something like that but I realized that Paul on the road of Damascus with papers in his pocket to persecute those that was preaching Jesus Christ and I believe that pillar for I told him right there those people that you're Prosecuting that's me that's it and it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what I become right and you say this and people say you're making yourself God and all that put that far as out as your mind as you can get but a Christian today is a manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ in human flesh exactly and I explained you know when they had that band right now what would Jesus do that really means more to me today yeah and people were putting it down and what have you but that means more to me today but on that Pillar of Fire when I realized what that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost the second coming of Christ the lord Jesus said in you the hope of glory right I hope I hope and pray everybody sees that and if they don't see it I hope it comes to them you know but I've been sitting here all this time thinking about that I said I say when I hear preachers preach it they'll say I'm Jesus whom I'm Jesus Lord who aren't I I'm Jesus all right I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted right got the papers in the pocket for the people of that day right someone you in that song We Sing it's no longer I that live now that Christ that liveth in me I thought when we started that I thought that'd be the next national anthem people don't know who they are right you know I I just won't say that I hope it helps somebody yeah uh you know because I I believe that right I mean to make me disbelieve that there's some kind of catastrophe you'd have to have right yeah yeah it would take away everything I believe right because I believe and I've taught it I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ started on the day of Pentecost in his bride he come first to redeem his bride he comes a second time to catch her away third time with her so we are the part of his coming and why can't we believe it who's next anybody else yeah comments questions thoughts sister Freda um you have told us that we will be I mean maybe not literally me I mean but that we the bride will take this it'll be this message that goes to Israel okay um won't be us to take it says Moses well you know brother Adam told us it was Moses and Elijah right well well or do you know will the the people Moses and Elijah that takes this back to the Jews will it be a present day person to people with a spirit of Moses and Elijah like brother Branham had the spirit of Elijah so that person could possibly be alive I mean could already be born and yeah wrote a Brandon will mentioned one time as we go up they come down but that's still terminologies and words you use um I personally believe that it will not be a resurrection of Moses and Elijah you know in the form of that way it will be the spirit of Moses and Elijah in the two witnesses and they will take this message because this message is the Bible and brother Branham in the seal book Seventh seal I'm pretty sure it's a little close to the end he says there he said they'll tell them look you missed it you turned it down but said these people have become that see so it'll be they got to tell them about us because of how they're going to how they're going to tell them they rejected it they got to tell them about a bride that becomes one you know so it'll be the Bible that goes to Israel through two witnesses but I personally believe that it will be the spirit of Moses and Elijah through to men and I have no problems with the statements you said could they be here now uh if they don't just drop down out of the sky they evidently supposed to be here but they will not be working not saying they wouldn't be prophets not saying they wouldn't have the ministry of prophets but they're not in the Limelight today they're waiting on us to leave because you can't have them here preaching about the Jews with us here preaching about the Jesus right you you can't have a tear together so we got to get out of here and brother random says that Israel we'll see God coming for his bride and think he's coming after them that's a direct quote they will see a bride walk off of this Earth one day how much of that will be seen I don't know physically I ain't concerned about it I just believe somebody is going to become the word and that'll be seeing it what would be the difference in them literally seeing us on a TV screen are the two witnesses walk out and say the Gentiles has accepted this and they've gone into rapture now's your day you're going to have to be killed as your brethren I feel sealed Jew people they're gonna are killed he said let me over with pretty quick they got a short time right anybody else foreign they got to beat two Prophets and one brother in this message believed that it was a gentile bride and a gentile prophet of course he believed he was the prophet what else would he say it that way right I looked at him I said no way don't take gentiles he said you don't believe it could be that way I said no sir I've got the quotes from The Prophet that Israel won't exceed receive a gentile Prophet They will receive Jews not gentiles let's cut it off now because he's done the end of the tape okay let's go right on the end to the communion you got any more let me know and we'll we'll try to cover it but I pray and hope that you see what I'm talking about and uh you know and like I said if I'm wrong come and tell me I'm wrong don't tell everybody else I'm wrong you just come tell me you know because that's the way it's supposed to be I tell you what I believe why won't you tell me what you believe all right let's stand together we'll go right on into the bless we like to always do one thing I do because I like to give everybody a change to get everything right so let's just saying I love him as we prepare for the communion and you know if you got anything wrong get rid of it get it out of the way let's do it all right I love you I llah yeah because love me and purr just my salvey Asian own God the rain saying it unto him and think about him uh he loved him I I look why do you love him because he for got me and her just mine brought it to me give it to me paid the price oh okay yeah read history father we thank you for this day and the time and we pray that what we've been said is worthy of being said and we just done the best we could do and just help us Lord God is as we go on into this communion part Lord as we partake of this we ask you to make us all worthy because we're not worthy in ourselves to do anything which you can make us Worthy you wrote about Abraham that he's the tiger not so you could write about the little bride did she become your word we love you and we thank you we just ask you to forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness May the thoughts of our mind the meditations of our heart come to a place to be acceptable in thy sight but until that time would maybe come may they be wiped out by the blood of Jesus Christ that they be not in your presence that we may be perfect in you as we read your word and take the communion we pray you would bless and got each one in Jesus name Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take he this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner all so we took the cup when he had Subs saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this New Year's office you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoes the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body but it's called many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this but when we are judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherever my brother wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger that he meet at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest of us said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying for one another we love you and we thank you in Jesus name two the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread and we pray that you would just sanctify to each one of our bodies that as we're partakers of it that we would remember that it's a symbol of the body of our Lord and savior not to physical but assemble it's also a symbol of Thy word Lord there was there that bled for each one of us sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in Jesus name laughs but we always think about Israel in their Journey coming out the last thing they done was had communion they got together they ate together and then everything was said in order and they left for the Promised Land it would be a good thing I believe to be taken to communion and see the Dead Walk Among Us wonderful opportunity father we thank you for this wine it represents your blood and Lord we pray that you would just sanctify the wine and the partakers and as we eat a little piece of bread and we drank the little bit of wine that tomorrow it would be blood cells in our body because it's a natural thing and we know this is a natural thing but it has a spiritual application that you shed your blood for each one of us that your word could be revealed into our hearts bless us all together in you in Jesus name come morning by the river I'll rest knee the evergreen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I'll take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the streets too go on come morning hour by the river I'll rest sniff the evergreen tree I'll carry he might cross through the midnight come morning for me a solemn time a point of really sincere if we realize what this is and what's taking place it is not then no more symbol you know it's a reality in our hearts and lives and then we can just look right straight at it and say well thank you Lord thank you Lord it's for me you made me Worthy you gave me the opportunity now Lord just come on the scene and make the rest of it manifest is that true let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment well we're preparing getting ready reading in John the 13th chapter verse 2. and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is Care at Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do that I know it's not now but Thou shalt no Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus saith unto him he that is worse needeth not saved to wash his feet but it's clean never wit and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happier ye if you do them let's stand together and be dismissed and sisters can go downstairs for the foot washing Lord Jesus we thank
