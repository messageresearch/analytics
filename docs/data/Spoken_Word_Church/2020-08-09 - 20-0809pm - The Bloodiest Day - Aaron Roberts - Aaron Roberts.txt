elbow surgery and i thank the lord every day that the lord touched me amen you know i i've been many places and you know i've had opportunity you know i always want to share that testimony with people right because you know when they looked at my x-rays when i first broke my elbow you know when you you break your humerus contrary to popular opinion it ain't funny yeah right but you know they have a lot you have a lot of nerves in your elbow the handle does controls your hand and everything and that was one of the first things that that was dr davis was looking at one after my surgery was over with and i went back after posting for my post stop and he was checking to make sure my hand was okay and he was so relieved and he said you know he said i like to think i'm good but he said we had to find intervention and i appreciate doctors and surgeons amen who believe in god and uh yes sir the lord the lord knew what was going to happen but he sent the right man for the job that's right amen that's right and uh amen you know even when i had my went through my therapy and everything and when they went to do my permanent impairment rating when that physical therapist saw my x-rays she didn't believe i was the same person they said i only lost three percent of use in that arm and most of the days i don't even realize i've missed three percent so i always thank god for that every single day you know i had a i've had uh physical therapists and even dr davis my surgeon you know there's other people that's had the same accident that i did breaking your humerus and you know they never gain use of their arm or very limited use and you know it's just the grace of god that i was that's right got back all the use that i did and uh i thank the lord every day for that so praise god that's always i remember lily's birthday i had a had a great had a great day you know you have trials and tribulations come your way but you know if he if he's gonna bring you into a trial the scripture tells you tells us that he's make a way for us to get through them so i just thank the lord for that every single day so if you have your bibles this afternoon we're gonna read from uh three different places in the scripture of isaiah 53 then we're going to go to hebrews 9. kind of talk about some of the things that wade said this morning and uh i told him i said i was going to say as brother wade said this morning so but uh hopefully hopefully it'll be a blessing to you amen but uh i want i want to speak on odd title the bloodiest day but i'm i want to talk about some things and hopefully it'll it'll be a blessing to you but uh let's just all bow our heads and we'll speak to the author this afternoon dear heavenly father lord we thank you for another opportunity to be in your house lord lord that we can come and gather around your word father you said where two or three are gathered in my name amen i'm in the midst lord it doesn't even have to be a physical location lord but as long as we are gathered in you and lord many are watching via the internet today lord jesus in their homes or wherever they may be lord i just pray that you'll be with them lord because we all gather in you in christ and we just pray that you come and speak to each heart and each life lord just help me to get myself out of the way lord anoint each one of us lord lord that we can receive from you it's it's not a man lord but it's you speaking through a man through a gift and lord we pray that the holy ghost has preeminence in this service today lord jesus lord i've studied and i've looked at things and lord i've just committed myself to you help us today lord lord we just want to lift you up we want to live praise your great name for all that you've done for us lord you've brought us through many trials and temptations lord as the scripture says song talks about lord we've come through many things but lord lord you led us all the way through some through the water some through the flood some through great trials but lord we've all come through the blood and lord we just so thankful for that blood today lord jesus as we look into the scripture and speak lord what a what a marvelous thing that you've done for us lord we can't praise you enough for it lord let us just have our hearts and our minds on you today lord lord just give us what we have need of give us our daily bread this day in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen amen isaiah 53 and it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed he said for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hit as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not now going to hebrews chapter 9 says but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not with this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead sins to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that we were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead now i want you i want you to pay attention to that otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry if i don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission first timothy 6 12 we're just going to read one scripture he says fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses amen god bless you this afternoon have your seats and i want to i want to read a little a little story to you and imagine a place where there was a law or a word that declared freedom and liberty to all no bondage to anyone but in this place through unbelief and the hardness of hearts they broke this declaration this law and great turmoil continued which was the condition of the time and so as as it continued said there was two laws during this time came into existence to govern the people but you know what they never could get away from the first law that was written the first law had to be fulfilled and so during all this great turmoil in this time you know they never could get away from the law that was written this this word that was given and because because of this unsettled condition there had to be one that come and settled that question why were some free and well some were not and why were they in the condition what was the land in the condition that it was in and one day there was a man that was born he came and he came from humble beginnings here was a man who was born in one place and he was raised in another place it was said that his mother believed that she had a word from the lord her son would do great things a number of folks saw nothing special in this man as a young man he amazed people with his speech and understanding though he had no formal training or education he was known for making things out of wood one day one day while speaking he declared to the people that a house divided against itself cannot stand but there were a lot of people that wanted to hold on to their old traditions and they just wanted to hold the the old men the old ideas they just wanted to cling to their traditions and stay in a lukewarm condition they didn't want to ruffle anything they just wanted everything try to keep everything as as it was they treated a temporary condition that only pushed the question forward and then the question never was answered and it just kept going forward but this man that was his desire to settle this question he was so hated that they tried to kill him before he ever got started he had to come secretly to a place to fulfill his oath to come to come to the place where he was to fulfill the the law the word that was written of him this man did not act sufficiently to suit some he did not act the way that some people thought they thought his his behavior was rep reprehensible and beneath the station of his life and people saw if this man only knew what was going on how could he act like the way he did but see they didn't understand him this man was identified with the old testament prophets yet they called him a devil and this embodiment of the word that was written of him walked out and declared and made a decree that all who were bound would be set free that was his decree that he made that liberty and freedom would be of those who desired it there came a time in this and this great struggle we see that there was a war taking place and it and it raged on and there was no place for it to come to an end there come a day where they that they they say is the bloodiest day and nobody saw the the great thing that was taking place that day but it was a it was a it was a bloody day but on that from that bloodiest day of that shedding of blood a decree went forth that the enemy's power was broken but you know what it was not realized on that day said the war still raged on but it never changed but after this decree went forth and it came into effect they were people that started to walk in a realm that they had never walked in before that people could walk in in a realm and because they could walk in the law that was written the word that the decree that had went forth they could walk in that in that word and it was totally new to these people but it was it was totally new but you know what they were victorious in what they were doing because and they began begin to walk and they began to decree to everyone of the liberty that they had and you know even during this time there were ups and downs and they were victories and there were defeats but you know what they were still an enemy that was defeated and they still did not see that enemy defeated but you know what after that time as time went on they saw that the enemy came to a total defeat amen and one day after this the men who were in rebellion to this kingdom had to give reverence they had to swear their allegiance to this man and his domain they had to they had to show their their reverence even even though they they were acting in a rebellion and they didn't like what was going on and everything but yet they had they had to a voice who he was and his position now i want to ask y'all a question who do you think i'm speaking of this afternoon does anybody have any idea who very good you probably read that don't read it already abraham lincoln abraham lincoln that's who that was the bloodiest day was the battle of antietam the battle of sharpsburg maryland and the decree that went out from that battle after that battle was lincoln's emancipation proclamation and you know many people think that when you when you read that most people think you're talking of jesus and they think that's the plan of salvation but you know what they don't real you know they don't see what what a great man that lincoln was and you know you kind of know where i'm where i'm going but i i just you know what's so amazing is we had opportunity a few weeks ago we went to springfield and we actually got to go to kentucky see where lincoln was born where he grew up and we got to go springfield see his tomb his home and you know we got to spend a little time looking around and you know most people don't know this my birthday is february 12th i was born on i think it was the 165th i had birthday of lincoln i i was born on abraham lincoln's birthday and he's one of the greatest people to me brother branham said in the influence of another he said but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president that we ever had in this nation was abraham lincoln now not because he was a republican because what he what he was because he was what he was a godly man and he raised up to serve god he said if there's anything that i want to give praise to he said or my life was influenced by was a godly mother who taught me to pray and how to know jesus as my savior you know that was one of the reasons why i read the scripture that i did a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief you know he lost he lost lincoln lost a lot of uh family members he lost sons his sister his mom but you know he had a he had a mom that passed away when he was young but he had a stepmother that came and his stepmother was a godly woman and she said from the first time she met abraham lincoln when he was a child she knew god was going to do great things through him just like jesus you know mary had a had an angel visitation that told her who jesus was and he would do great things but you know we talk about these these things and you you look at the life of people and you know brother branham said that you know abraham lincoln didn't have a didn't have an education but he said he didn't he didn't allow that hold him back you know all the you look at all the things that he done in his that he done in his life all the things that was against him and you know brother man talks about as christians you know we have all these trials and and problems and temptations but are we using that as a crutch are we actually using that to our ability you know because you know we have we have the same goal and we have the same commission to be the best that we can be to to do all that we can for god and you know to see these things and you know to do what god has called us to do god didn't call us to all be the same thing god didn't call us to all do the same thing but he called us to be faithful to what he called us to and you know brother branham speaking here this is from jesus christ the same yesterday day and forever 1955 he said did you ever come to think of it that most men who ever did anything great for the kingdom of god stand alone do you ever think of it you have to stand by yourself jesus stood alone and all down through the ages other men who stood along finney sankey and calvin knox even to abraham lincoln that's right stood alone men who do great things men of vision men of spiritual understanding stand alone and to think that's because that jesus had to stand alone himself so you know you look at the you look at the life of abraham lincoln and you know when you read the things that that he that he went through you know lincoln said one time that he said that uh my best friend is a person who gave me a book that i've never read you know he had an insatiable desire you know his dad wanted him just to work but you know his his stepmom she encouraged him to study and because he had a learn had a desire to learn brother branham said that he had two books that he wrote that he read from he said he had a bible he had the fox's book of markers he said one of the books that he read the most was the other book that he read a lot was the pilgrim's progress you know there's there's people today that read abraham lincoln's writings not for the things that they say but because of the style in which he wrote they said there's not there's not a writer that they can find anywhere that was so influenced by the scripture in his writings that that that they compare him to the to the scriptures to the scribes of the old testament and the in the bible because he was so influenced by the scripture in his writings and you know you know because in lots of times when he began to speak and and uh make speeches and everything there's a lot of things that come out of the scripture to to uh the way he the way he uh answered questions and different things was all scriptural because he was so influenced by the scripture and you know it's so amazing because you know many times people talk about you know stonewall jackson and different ones that brother ram talks about you know being so influential you know jackson was the one that you know he talks about you know he said i i thank god there was a man that wrote to him it was a friend of his and wrote to jackson and he said he said the scripture says pray without ceasing he said i don't understand that he said i find that very hard to do and general jackson said that's very easy for me he said he said i can't drink open as just as natural it is for me to open my mouth to drink a take a sip of water he said it's just that simple to thank god for the water he said everything he said just taking out we take out paper and pen to write a letter he said it's just that simple to pray for the person that you're writing it to and he said when i took a letter that that i go to open he said i pray to god for to prepare me for the contents of it and he said you know he said when he taught in school at the virginia military institute you know he said i pray for the students he said i pray for me that i'll be the right kind of instructor for them because you know he was he was uh molding these young men that had been given to his charge and you know and so everything that that he had to do and you know lincoln was the same type man everything that he done everything that he said had to be influenced by the scripture why and so you know and today you know are we that influenced by the scripture are we so influenced by the scripture by the word that that everything that that you know people will hear us speak are we so worldly are we so are we so relaxed or are we are we so involved are we so you know full of the word that people see that you know because you know that's what we have to have in this hour you know are you are we holding on to the word that much do we do we stand out against the things that are wrong do we speak out against the things that are wrong you know lincoln's lincoln's greatest thing i i guess the thing you know because the the uh thing that that he was so against the thing that he stood against the most that he's so uh known for was slavery and you know when you go to the we were at the the national muse of the presidential museum there in springfield and you know there's a there's a a um a statue it's a saying big stage there that you can look at but it it shows the new orleans and the slave trade and brother brown talks about those women are you know and the husbands being pulled away from each other and and mothers being separated from their children being sold off as animals and you know he talks about you know he saw that in new orleans and it had such had such a profound effect on him and he said you know he said i'm gonna strike i'll hit against that thing he said if it takes my life you know and and he's and he said it it did cost him his life but that was the one thing that he was going to stand against and you know in the beginning of our nation in the beginning of our nation you know when the founding fathers sat down and began to write about our nation you know what they had come out from underneath bondage you know because they didn't have they didn't have the rights and the freedoms why because they were mistreated by great britain and they separated you know we were going and we just decided that we were going to establish a land a nation based on laws not based on mob rule not by just some willy-nilly whoever's in charge fluctuating back and forth but you know what because the founding fathers said that god had given us rights that no man can take away from you they were given that unalienable rights and and our government was established to recognize those the government didn't give you your rights god gave you your rights we were given those freedoms because we were we were creations of god you know when when lincoln went back to that you know as they said you know he was looking back at what the founding fathers had said and you know even in the beginning they they were anti are abolitionists that wanted to get rid of slavery from the beginning but you know what they couldn't they would because they had to hold this country together long enough for it to get started and the only thing they could do is create a compromise and you know what it started a struggle and you know what it always had struggled all the way down through history there's a story that said that lincoln's family moved from kentucky because kentucky allowed slavery and his dad was against slavery and so when he went and then they had some other personal issues that took place some land disputes and different things that happened in kentucky which led them to illinois but you know all these things you know he went back and was looking at at this struggle that took place and you know and it ju and it was as time went on you can't you can't just cover it up you can't just hide it you just can't bury it why because there had to come a time when somebody had to answer this question this question had to be answered because that's the reason when lincoln stood up that day in in 1858 and he made that speech he said a house divided against himself cannot stand he said he said this country cannot be half slave and half free he said because at some point in time he said it's got to be all free or it's got to be all slave you can't have both of them it's not going to continue this way and we see all the way through the scripture we see different ones who who raised up and and you know they they wanted to to continue the president before lincoln was president buchanan buchanan didn't want to take on the the idea of slavery he just wanted it to continue the same way it was we've always had slavery it's always been this way why don't they just continue why because you know what the fabric of this nation wouldn't stand you can't live that way and as it continued to bowl over you know what there had to come a time that there had to come an answer and it so fractured this nation that there was no well you know they had to have somebody come that was that would stand up and either be total slavery or be totally against it there had to be one that would come to answer that question and you know even lincoln was personally against it yeah he said yet if if the government allows it then it has to continue that way but until there's a time in which it can be eliminated but you know what and that's the reason that you know people thought that that he acted too slow or he was he didn't act in a certain way and he went he didn't just go in and just bulldoze everything as as the saiyan is why because he had to go according to the law you know and jesus we're going to you know uh look at look at a few things in in jesus's life you know jesus hung out with a bunch of sinners and publicans and all these are and people's like do you do you know why why is he if he's exactly who he says he is and why does he fellowship with these type people why does he do the things that he does and jesus said you know he said the the physician doesn't go to the people that are well he goes to the people that are sick these are the people that need it they they need this help and he said i'll come to them he said because this is the people that i'm i'm to come to but you see lincoln came to do this one this one thing god raised him up why because it was a time that it had to be answered but you know they hated lincoln so much that they tried to kill him multiple times had on the way from springfield to washington dc for the inauguration they had the presidential train coming from springfield but he got to a certain point before he got to baltimore i believe it was they had to swap trains alan pinkerton who is from the pinkerton agency the great american detective you know he was uh able to um intervene found out about the plot and then he was able to make a way that he came in secretly into washington without anyone knowing he was already in washington before the train ever made it and you know they tried they wanted to kill jesus too you know they wanted to kill jesus and you know he told the disciples one day he said um you know that uh there in uh believe is a mark where he talks about going up to the feast of tabernacles and he said you know he said i'm not going but you know he didn't go the way they said they thought he was but he went secretly to fulfill that oath because you know the one thing is that jesus had to fulfill the law that was written of him amen he with the scripture the word was written of him and he had to fulfill it and so when he went to go fulfill that just like lincoln when he went to go fulfill the oath that was because the law said that he was supposed to go take this oath of his office well he had to go fill the law just like jesus did jesus had to go and do the do the same thing he had to go fulfill the law that was written of him so he had to go because he had to present himself at the feast because that was that was the law of god and so you see all these different things that that he done in his life as he went through you know you know the of the the the humble beginning in his life and you know you he he read they said that lincoln had about if you totaled up the whole time that he went to school it equaled up about less than a year of time that he had spent but you know he learned on his own but you know here's here's a guy to come from the backwoods of kentucky and you know people just thought he was some kind of country bumpkin that didn't know anything but you know what he had read and god had blessed him with it with a skill that when people come even when peter cartwright who was the the methodist preacher the circuit riding preacher that brother ram talked about when they were when he first met lincoln lincoln was just some backwoods kid that uh like in his early 20s that he didn't think anything of until he started talking to lincoln and come to find out lincoln want no pushover he come to find out he met a guy that actually knew something he was astonished at what this man knew they just thought he was some kind of country bumpkin out there splitting wood and hoe and corn but you know what he had actually had had a a gift and actually had studied and people were surprised at what he knew but some people didn't see any greatness in him you know just like jesus you know jesus being 12 years old in the in the temple discussing with the scribes and the and the doctors and the pharisees and all and they were amazed at whose kid is this that he had done all these great things but see all these things you know and most people didn't even know who he was well they didn't know who jesus was he was virtually unknown until he began to speak and you know even when he began to speak people thought you know that he didn't know what he what he believed because you know they had already had all their all the great scribes and all the pharisees and all you know they had all of their traditions of how everything was supposed to be they don't they they believed everything a certain way you know they want to hold on well we're we're abraham's seed and you know we release we've received the law of moses and we've always done it this way but you know what there was one that come to he was he was the fulfillment of that word he was the embodiment of that word when lincoln come into into the presidency he was the embodiment of this word he was the of this country he was the embodiment of this country and he came to to fulfill the word the law the constitution that was written of him and when he came then he came to do this job was to fight this great stain on our country and so we see how this thing went they were fighting you know there were so many that you know they they hated lincoln for for what he stood for he's going to destroy our way of life well you know what this is the la you know because when you look at it this was the needed to be destroyed one because it couldn't continue the same way it was but this but the word that was ultimately written of us by our our law said that all men are created equal amen so you couldn't have some that had it and some that didn't and so when you when you see how this all was to play out then you know we see this great war that took place and you know it wasn't though that lincoln wanted this war but you know it was what took place it's the way that people reacted to it you know he didn't he did not want that but he wanted to bring the people to the place that they needed to come to to see the truth and you know they they come up with this great war and and you know we see how it just it was such a terrible war that took place and in the midst of all this fighting and and everything taking place you know there was there if you look at it there was no way this war was ever going to come out the way it did it took because when that when you saw the the first fighting and the union just taken a beating uh beating and beating and you know all of the generals that lincoln had there was none of them that were worth anything and you know he struggled with all that and he had so many people that was against him and you know brother brahm said he that he was a man that had to stand by himself because nobody else agreed with him you know here he was standing there and he was saying no we need to fight because this is a place we've got to have unity we've got to hold this union together this is this is the job that is required because that's that's what this nation was founded on that we that we all stand together in unity and we and we see how all of this fighting took place and and everybody just ridiculed him and you know and you you find you find black some of the former slaves that have been freed and they were out there you know they identified with him with every old testament prophet they called him the messiah and you know what and all of the southerners called him the devil and they they they ridiculed him and done all kinds of terrible things about him and and you know he lincoln got to the point where he wouldn't even allow a newspaper in the white house he's like because he didn't he didn't need any of that kind of stuff but you know even all the people that he worked with that worked for him none of them would uh agree to what he wrote and he had to stand alone but you know it was because if you're going to do anything great for god you can't have everybody else telling you what needs to be done that's right you don't need to have somebody else putting it in your ears you need to come to a place where you hear from god for yourself and you know it was so amazing because all of this this fighting that was going on and and one day there was a at the the battle of antietam was they call it the bloodiest day we lost more soldiers that day over 22 thousand almost 23 000 men were killed in one single day the bloodiest day in american history they call it and that one bloodiest day we mcclellan's forces were able to repel these forces they were retreated and because of that see it wasn't it wasn't a great victory that day they couldn't see any great war you know anything anything great took place but you know what they turned the forces of evil back the south yeah and you know because of lincoln saw seeing that take place you know he had already written out the emancipation proclamation before that battle ever started he had already come up with of what he was going to do you know a lot of people make you know they always criticize lincoln for the things that he done but you know the things that he done was you know he was just like everybody else you're growing grace and knowledge just like jesus scripture said he grew in grace and knowledge he didn't have all the answers even later on jesus told the disciples he said i don't know when when the second time coming is going to be i don't know all these different things he hadn't told him he said it's up to the father to know these things but you know he had to grow in grace and knowledge but you know he had one one thing that he held on to was that god would lead him in the direction that he needed to go he had so many great things one of the one of the things that i always liked when they asked him said do you do you know if the lord's on our side or the lord's on their side he said sir i'm not concerned whether the lord's on my side he said i want to be on the lord's side because he said the lord's always right that's right you know that's that you know instead of us trying to trying to bring the word to our idea we need to line up our thoughts to the word we need to see what the word says that we can line up our thoughts and compare it to that to make sure that we're right because you know what the lord's always right we may well you can read the scripture and a lot of people have read the scripture and looked at a lot of different things but you know what it's not it doesn't match up many people have read matthew 28 19 and you know and that's what the bible says but you know that's not right many people have read read the scripture from cover to cover and quote the scripture to you and believe in a trinity so if we're going to read the scripture we need to make sure that we line it up to god's thoughts not our thoughts because you know what our thoughts can be wrong and we're many times we're wrong more than we're right because you know what if we don't take it by what god gives us and shows us what the truth is we have a lot of things wrong we have a lot of questions but you know what when we see this battle that took place and and you know then this decree went out you know there was it wasn't it wasn't a great day it didn't it didn't change the world it didn't it didn't destroy all the powers of the enemy it didn't it didn't it didn't end the war but you know what it started it started on that day when that took place it took that one thing that one battle and when that occurred then you know the south lost recognition throughout the world great britain didn't back them france didn't back them so you know what they were kind of cut off from the world and that you know people thought well you know they still had and you know what they still bought a lot of battles that they lost the union still lost a lot of battles after that and people were still concerned that the union was going to collapse the war had got the war effort had gotten so bad that they didn't think lincoln would get re-elected but you know what everything had already been put in place had already been put in motion for this thing to go the way that it did yeah but people didn't see that and so you know and and then as time went on we saw that they were men that was that raised up that can tell you know that continued the the fight general grant general sherman different ones you know they didn't hold back you know when the when when general grant was put in charge he told him told lincoln he said you know he said it's going to get ugly it's a battle can a contrition you know attrition you know we're just gonna keep on going forward we're not going back for anything and it got ugly it got bad but you know what they had they had a resolve that they were gonna end this thing they were going to crush it when they when they realized that and a lot of people and different different generals you know they were they walked in a realm that they were so afraid of different things and they thought you know they couldn't win and and all you know and they were so ill-prepared for things but you know you you have to you have to be prepared for what you're going to do and if you get to that place where they they got into the you know the different ones that got in in charge you know when they got into battle you know they didn't give up and they and they fought to they got they got the victory and they kept pushing them back and because the south was in the in the position that it was in it began to collapse and you know it took a long time for it to come through and actually get to the place where it needed to be but you know what they after it after this great battle and then you see this war continue and continue you know what they finally had to uh admit lee finally had to surrender because you know he couldn't he couldn't fight any longer he had to give up and so you know and then all those all those men you look back all those men that were fighting for you know and then a man of mercy and grace lincoln could have went through and just just massacred so many of them he could have hung them shot them done so many different things but you know what he let me in go back with their horses with their weapons a lot of men got to go home for the simple fact that they swore their allegiance to the united states and that's all he required of them when a lot of you look at a lot of wars that's taking place in the in the in the world they don't you know when you surrender it's on then they murder them left and right but you know they there were so many people that had so much resentment and and just anger and and everything against these people and and lincoln walked out there and said listen he said y'all need to put all that behind you he said because we're brothers and let me tell you if if you can't see if you can't see christ in in in in the life of lincoln i don't think you can find it anybody you know because you know many times we find people in the scripture and we read the scripture but you know people say you know who who in this world can you see that you see the life of jesus christ people want to talk to want to go to the bible and they want to look and say well this is it people so who in this world can you stand up and and point to somebody that's actually had to go through the great turmoils and things and and live the kind of life that that saw that people saw jesus christ in their life you know and so what we see these kind of things in and and you know i i just wanted to bring out a few things to show you uh because it really just it just stirs me up inside because you know that's what that's what god wants us to see in this scripture but you know you go back from the beginning god god give us a word god never wanted us to live bound brother brother branham said you know god never give us a a place to be bound he wanted us to be free god never wanted us to live in sin he you know he said there never was a time in this world he ever wanted to have a funeral service there was none of those things sickness heartache disease all these things were not part of god's plan but you know what that was man's plan that was man that got away from god's eternal word because the word had declared what was what was ours but you know a man had to get into his own own way and create his own own way of of doing things and having his own thoughts and it created death and it's and it's ever been ever since then it's just been all this contention that has been in this world we live in a world that is full of contention even from the beginning there was an enmity between god's seed and the seed of the serpent and we see this great enmity between the satan and and god this fight this conflict that was taking place and you know and so satan has always thought that he could beat god because you know he said i'll be like the most high you know he was going to be just like god he was going to do these great things but you know he never could be like god he can try as much as he can but he can't be like god but you know all this fighting is war and going on and you know we see that there were times in history when when when god when people the children of israel and different ones walk close to god and the next time you turn around and they're following all the the idols of the world and and doing all the things that were contrary to the word and they would go back and walk with god and try to live right and they would go right back why because there was no answer there was no final answer there was there was no way to settle this question it had to come to a finality that it had to come where it was actually answered and you know you go back and and and look in the scripture when as brother wade was speaking you know you go back in and you think about and and passover and the different ones and and you think of all of the blood that was shed all of those lambs that went all of those bullocks all of those turtle doves every one of them that they brought forth and all of you know every time that a child was born when when they came they had they had to bring an uh offering a sacrifice to the to the priest for the for the children and passover and all the other different things that they had to go through in their life every time you they had to bring different offerings and all of this bloodshed was taking place all the way through life they were all the time bringing their gifts but the scripture tells us all of that all of that blood that was shed all of those animals could not change anybody it could not change the fact that that they they were still had that same desire they were still living in the same way but you know what there had to come one who could bring the answer and he said you know and he typed there was one that could could answer that question you know when it when when it came time for him to come into the world because it had been prophesied that he would come that he would come and fulfill this word well you know what people didn't agree with him people didn't even recognize him he had a terrible name and even you know he just come from a poor background and nobody ever cared anything about him and you know they said who is this guy and then he said well you know this man has a devil yeah you know they had all these terrible things to say about him but you know what he had a word and he and he knew what god had told him to do and he said he said the son can do nothing in himself except what he sees the father do he said that do it the son likewise one because he had been given a commission to come into this world and to answer the sin question one because god never wanted us to be bound he never wanted us to be sick he said he wanted us to be happy this he said look at the way it was in the garden of eden god made a perfect place for man to live and he never would have to get old and he never would have to deal with all these things it was a perfect place to live and then god wanted us to come in and live in this condition but you know what god people but man adam and eve got away from god's word but you know what when he came he made a way back but the problem is is people don't want to take this word and come back you can't get them to see because they they have their old traditions as you know because they're living by the old man okay like like president buchanan thought well you know we're just going to live the same way we've always lived well you know that's the same old man same old traditions people want to live by that old same same old way the same old thing the devil has told them all these years and they still want to live the same way but he said i've come that you might have life and have it more abundantly see so when he came into this world he came to do one thing he said i come to seek and save those who are lost [Music] and we've seen all of that bloodshed all the way down through the time as the scripture said and it couldn't change anybody but you know what there was one that came that he came to shed his blood that you might have an eternal inheritance and you know what he was fought all the way through scorned and mocked and everything else but you know what they didn't deter him from from the work that he was supposed to do you know what he just put all that out of his mind and you see the and you know speaking of lincoln you you see you see how he had he had to do the same thing he had to go and he had to come to a place that he had to realize you know it didn't matter what anybody else said he knew what his commission was and god was going to call him to that place in the right time he had to do what god wanted him to do and he came to that place and jesus came to the place one minute people were cheering him and praising him and singing his praises and everything and the next minute they were all calling him the devil and they wanted him crucified and you know and he and he stood out there and he watched these people and though you know some of them that just loved him so much and the next minute they hated him so much and he stood up there and said father forgive them for they know not what they do and he went and he went to the cross willingly nobody had to take his life from him he gave his wife his life willingly because he he had such a love for us and knew what what the end result was going to be that he went out and and gave his life no one had to take it from him so when he went on the cross and he said and lord into my hands i come in my spirit when the spirit left him then you know he just died that that body was gone you know the life had left that body is just hanging there you know they pierced his side but you know you look at you look at the the bloodshed you know when we talk about the bloodiest day you know you think about well we talk about the old testament and all that bloodshed but you know you think about the the the one that came who knew no sin who left who left the splendor of heaven when he left everything to come down to be lower than the angels when he came to be man to walk in in sinful flesh not that he was sinful but he came to live the same kind of journey that you and i walk he knows what what sickness is he knows what a heartache is he knows what all the problems that you've been through he knows exactly what it is so that he can be the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that he knows all these things that he walked and you know what he gave up his life but when he went he took all those stripes on his back that he become to look like more than just just you know unrecognizable as a human to look like hamburger meat and he'd done all that for you and i that we can stand here today and and and be recipients of eternal life that we can be sons and daughters of god now if you and i can live just like that because he gave everything that he had everything about him he gave his all because he had one desire amen you know you know lincoln stood there and you know he he said i'm gonna give he said he said if it takes my life he said i'm gonna do this he actually he because nobody there was a lot of people in this world that didn't didn't even believe black people had a soul and yet and yet lincoln said that he believed that black men were black people were just like him they were creations of god that's right and and fought and fought the fight that he had to fight and you know what was so amazing people didn't recognize what lincoln had done while he was here you know jesus came and walked in flesh and to be this the great sacrifice the propitiation that for you and i and here he was given his life and it cost him his life this great bloodshed but you know what he he left he he left a legacy lincoln when you see the kind of life you know because if you see if you can't see jesus christ in that man and you know that that's the way we ought to wake up every single day to have a desire to live like jesus christ when you when you see how jesus came and all the things jesus jesus could have had many things in this world he could have had a family he could have done many things but you know he sanctified himself that he could be to to the job to the to the uh commission that he was given to fulfill the word he sanctified himself to the father that he could do the work to be a willing vessel for the father and come and fulfill all these different that fulfill all the word that was written of him that you and i can can be given all the great things that we have been given in this in this life and you know one of the things one of the saddest things is there were people that don't want to live that live below their means you know they still live in bondage when they know there's a way that's been to been made to be free you know brother brother branham talks about he talks about those slaves when that decree went out you know he said they began to they began to hear about this decree and when it when it was made known he said you know they started climbing the mountains he said when the sun came up they were waiting for the sun to rise on that certain day the emancipation proclamation that from a second came into effect on january the 1st 1863 but you know they were waiting for that thing to come because that was their day of freedom they had heard the word and they were waiting for that day and then and brother bram talks about in the message letting off the pressure and he's talking about those slaves when they when they heard about that and you know they had been waiting for this day and they you know talk about all the ones that were climbing up the mountain the strongest christians you know the ones that climbed up that mountain to get up on the top and he said as soon as they started to see the light cracking through when the sun was coming up and they started to see the light he said then they were started screaming back down the mountain we're free we're free wine because we're seeing the sun come up we're seeing the sun rise we're seeing the sun and where he's he's declaring to us that we are free you know and he said you know even though even though they were walking in darkness they didn't see what other people saw but you know what they had heard the word and the word were told them that they were free and you know what in time they began to see the light of the word that they had the decree that had been made and you know brothers and sisters we've heard the word we've heard the word that we're free you know what that all that god has he poured into us he said holy the god was he poured into christ and all that he all the christ was he poured into the bride he poured into the believer so the thing is is he said you are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ and if you and i are the same then you know what we don't have to live we don't have to take the things that that satan puts in front of us we don't have to listen to this we can we can stand up and claim our god-given rights one because the son has been has risen in our day and he said whom the sun has set free is free indeed and the question is to you do you see the sunshine do you see the sunlight have you seen the sunrise is the sun shining in your life are you seeing the effects of the sun that's right are you seeing these things are you seeing it what god has given us in this day i thank god for it yes amen i don't want i don't want to live the same way that i used to i don't want to go back through the old things i want i you know because i want to walk in newness of life i want i want to walk you all that god has called me to i don't want to live the old way you know because i tell you what the old man is dead i don't want to go out there digging him up if he's dead and you know what dude it's time to put all that behind us we don't we don't need to be digging it up we don't need to be trying to rehash the past one because if it's in the blood then as paul said you know he said putting those things behind us he said we need to press toward the mark of the high calling why because god has called us to a place that we need to not worry about the past because if it's if it's buried if it's in god's sea of forgetfulness then we don't need to be trying to worry about it anymore people so worried about things that happen in the past you know you need to not worry about that anymore why because god has called us to a higher place god has called us to greater things and we need to be climbing that mountain because if you're in darkness and you can't see the light very well then there's a mountain to climb on top of and see the sunshine god has called we need to go and see where we can see what what god has given us where is this light is shining on the word to show us who we are that god has called us to a place that you know we have been commissioned we've been called we have been given the word right for a body change you know other people desired to see our day and god has called us to a place that we can see the things that god has he's always wanted this to be to show these things he always wanted these things this was god's mystery secret the brother ram said in christ the mystery he had a mystery that he wanted he wanted to but it was a secret it was a secret that had to be revealed and you know there was only a few that saw that but you know in time through the prophets he began to express amos tells us that it was a secret surely the lord god will do nothing except he reveal his secret to his servants the prophets but revelation tells us that we that it's a mystery because in the beginning when something is uh when something is hidden it's a secret so he's like if if i told wade something earlier and y'all didn't know that i had told him anything it's a secret because y'all don't know anything about it but you know as soon as i declare that i told wade something and y'all don't know what it is then it becomes a mystery because you've been made aware that something has been spoken right right and as soon as it becomes spoken then it becomes the mystery so what laid in the back part of god's mind was a secret but when he began to declare that then he was declaring what he knew to the prophets that was a secret to the prophets because he was making himself known then he began to declare to the people what he said and that became a mystery and then the mystery had to be made known [Music] and so that's what god has desired in our day is to all through the scripture all the things that people go back and they read things but you know what it's a it's a it's a mystery so sure they're reading all the stuff that jesus said in isaiah and and jeremiah and moses and all that but you know they don't see jesus christ in that and then and then they they read things and the problem is is they don't see themselves in the scripture it doesn't speak of them it speaks of people that have it's been in the past but see the thing is is we god wants us to read the scripture where we see jesus christ in it you know it's it's not that we're learning historical facts or anything but just see just like in the feast days when you say if you don't see jesus christ if you don't see your relationship with jesus christ and then it's just historical facts it's just history but if you don't see god wants us to not to be just just words on the page but he wants us to have it to be a living instrumentality he wants us to see that it's a living thing speaking to us he wants us to see that it's a relationship it's a life that's there if we don't see that then we've missed it god wants us god wants us to see these things and i just want to want to share this with you you know so many years later brother brown was talking about the he said that there was a black man he said he was standing in a museum and that black man saw that dress that was in that window and he said that man that man saw that thing and he said you know he was just crying and he was so overcome with emotion so brother branham come over to where he was at you know he said uncle he said you know what's wrong you know what's going on and he said all i could see was a dress he said i didn't see anything else but he said that that black man stood there and told him he said on that dress is the blood of abraham lincoln he said and he said i was just thanking god he told brother branham he said he said parson put your hand in here on my side you know brother brown felt he said that's where that slave belt was on that man had him bound and he said it was the blood of abraham lincoln that set me free and he said if a negro if a black man could see a blood of a man the blood of abraham lincoln could cause a man to react that way he said how much more should the blood of jesus christ cause us to react how much more should we react to the blood of jesus christ not just not just that we can say that a physical belt or a physical bondage was on us but you know what if we wake up and realize you know what spiritual bondage has been broken off us if we remember where we came from to realize where we are today then you know what there there's there's nothing in this world that can compare to that you know if it's you know as a soul is worth ten thousand worlds then you know what you know you can't put a price tag on that and you know you know many times people they they you can go along and you can you can live in the world and you can you can have fun you think you're gonna sneak around and do different things and you know you can just walk walk that little line between good and you know bad and right and wrong and all that kind of stuff but you know what you know you'll you'll find out that you won't play that game too long why because sin will carry you further than you'll ever want to go people you know young people they they get so wrapped up in things and not realizing it's it's a lot of fun for a while right just like moses the scripture says that he enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a season well the problem is is you never know when it's going to run out that pleasure is going to run out after a while and you never know there's a lot of people in this world that's been left with a lot of scars because of sin and just like that black man stood there and told brother branham about that slave belt you know he still had those scars but you know there was a blood to set him free but let me tell you you don't want to have there's a lot of scars that that we have that other people have you know that you don't want anybody to have to go down the same roads that you've been down to be free from these things and and we don't know how much longer we have but i i want everybody to be ready to go you know because i don't want anybody left behind you don't want to be left behind but i want to i want to share everybody i want to i just want to share with everybody there is a blood that can cleanse you from all unrighteousness it's the great it's the greatest day because you know what that blood still is still available today it's still as powerful as it ever was and he's still seeking and save and saving he's still calling those my question is are you going to answer the call are we going to be the one because you know god's not god's not going to just speak out of the air it's you and i that have to live the life to speak to those that need to be spoken to it's it's our job it's our it's our job to speak to people to tell them there's a better way just like brother wade was saying this this morning talking about you know can they see that life in you when they go do they see something different about you not not that you talk different and that you don't do certain things but when they walk into your presence do they realize there's something different about you amen you know i want to be in his presence so much that people around me feel his presence also you know it's as i preached some time back i preached on you know you're creating an atmosphere a difference between an atmosphere and you're an environment that's right you know do you live in the atmosphere or you dealt with the environment i told you know the children the hebrew children you know the environment they were in was a fiery furnace and you know the people that that led them on their way to the furnace after it was heated seven times hotter it killed them but the atmosphere that the hebrew children the hebrew boys were in was they didn't smell like smoke they didn't get sins there wasn't there wasn't a hair on their head that was injured they didn't have anything and they stayed in the fire the other people didn't even get into fire and it killed them so are you you know it's just are you living in the atmosphere because we create the atmosphere that we live in by the word you can create an atmosphere that you know what you can block out the environment we live in satan's eden you can't control the environment you know what devil's always going to fight you you're always going to have devil trying to put thoughts in your head there's always going to be things coming your way but you know what you create the atmosphere that you don't give place to the devil you you resist the devil and he flees from you so we have been called to that place to stand and fight this battle as first timothy 6 said fight the good fight of faith that's our desire god has made a way for us but we got to fight this fight let's let's fight this this battle we've been called to an eternal inheritance amen god bless you this afternoon let's all stand have the musicians come what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus and what can make me whole again is nothing but the blood of jesus i'm so glad i have that that blood that blood has been applied to me you know because it it's just like he told the the children of israel they had to take that blood and it didn't and it wasn't that they just had to have the blood they had to apply the blood and we have to have the blood applied not just to know about the blood it's the blood applied to every aspect of our lives you know we all have sins and shortcomings and failures but do we apply that blood that we can be what god would have us be i'm so i'm so glad that we have that apply the blood that's right as brother weeks was speaking on the other sunday let's have diligence in the things that god has called us to to make our calling and election sure amen god bless you
