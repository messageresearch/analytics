[9:24] amen don't let us forget I have a prayer
[9:27] cloth in handkerchief in my pocket that
[9:31] we will fix some more prayer claws this
[9:33] afternoon all right Revelations 1 we've
[9:36] been reading this for quite a while
[9:39] verse 12 and I turned to see the voice
[9:41] that spake with me and being turned I
[9:43] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[9:46] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[9:48] unto the son of man clothed with a
[9:50] garment down to the foot and G about the
[9:52] pals with a golden girdle his head and
[9:55] his hairs were white like wool as white
[9:58] as snow and his eyes eyes were as a
[9:59] flame of fire and his feet like
[10:02] undefined brce as if they burned in a
[10:05] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[10:08] many Waters you say well you sure have
[10:11] read that a lot of
[10:13] times uh I remember one time that I read
[10:16] the same scripture 60 something services
[10:22] so it's not too bad to just keep reading
[10:24] it maybe we'll learn what it means you
[10:25] know all right John
[10:28] 3
[10:29] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[10:31] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[10:34] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[10:37] Rabbi now notice he recognizes him Rabbi
[10:42] great something not just an average all
[10:45] right we know that thou art a
[10:47] teacher the teacher is uh you know would
[10:51] be uh bringing it to because he
[10:53] recognizes him as the teacher too in
[10:57] Israel and says um thou art a teacher
[11:00] come from God now what for no man can do
[11:03] the these Miracles that thou doest
[11:05] except God be with him now that's a
[11:07] great recognition right Jesus answered
[11:10] and said unto him verily verily I say
[11:12] unto thee except a man be born again he
[11:16] cannot see the kingdom of
[11:18] God Nicodemus sath unto him how can a
[11:21] man be born when he is old can he enter
[11:24] the second time into his mother's wound
[11:25] and be born Jesus answered verily verely
[11:29] I say unto theee except a man be born of
[11:32] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[11:35] into the kingdom of God that which is
[11:38] born to the flesh is flesh and that
[11:41] which is born to the spirit is Spirit
[11:45] Marvel not that I say unto thee you must
[11:47] be born again you may be seated
[11:51] which trying
[11:56] to
[11:57] okay
[12:03] okay trying to get an understanding
[12:07] trying to get to a place to see who we
[12:11] are and what we're
[12:13] doing and uh you know what we're doing
[12:17] here as we were talking about it last
[12:20] night then this age is the age to where
[12:24] that everything is winding up and and
[12:27] the word is to be revealed in this age
[12:30] to bring us to that place and we thank
[12:33] the Lord for
[12:35] it now a lot of people seemingly in the
[12:38] message has gotten away from many years
[12:40] ago from preaching on the new birth it
[12:42] was just uh one of those things that you
[12:46] you're a Believer you believe the
[12:48] prophet uh you believe this you believe
[12:51] that and that means that you're saved
[12:54] well we'll get to that in a little bit
[12:56] and all because today I want to ask the
[12:58] the
[13:00] question is and we'll read what the
[13:02] prophet says in a minute but why must
[13:05] you be born
[13:08] again say well this is just a good old
[13:11] Baptist message you know well maybe
[13:13] sometimes we need a little good old
[13:15] Baptist message to understand what's
[13:18] going on and all but I didn't know we
[13:21] were to take out scriptures because we
[13:24] had Advanced so much into the word
[13:29] until the little things were not needed
[13:33] anymore uh I thought we were believing
[13:35] that you know uh we all the word all
[13:39] right now we've been speaking for quite
[13:41] a while about how that man is a triun
[13:45] being not to spend much time on this but
[13:48] to make a background part that he's a
[13:52] triun being he's Body Spirit and soul
[13:55] right and that makes him to be a person
[13:59] you know a man of a a a
[14:04] being and then speaking of how that God
[14:09] condescended down to Mankind and he
[14:12] comes that way through Body Spirit and
[14:16] soul all right and giving it to where
[14:19] they we would uh see that we were not
[14:23] only created In His Image in Genesis 1
[14:27] but then he came in our image amen you
[14:31] know as to the things that we are and uh
[14:35] you know that's a wonderful part we can
[14:37] look at that and see it we see ourselves
[14:40] and we can see God in that part we see
[14:43] God and we can see ourselves because you
[14:45] know even the the Bible says the Eternal
[14:48] godhead can be understood by the things
[14:50] that we see amen all right then it's a
[14:53] wonderful thing to be able to follow it
[14:55] that way uh thank God for the message
[14:59] cuz we didn't know it that way amen we
[15:01] were just to the bases of this that or
[15:03] the other as we'll try to cover more in
[15:06] the message today but as I was making
[15:09] the point while ago what about a
[15:12] man that
[15:14] was you know and and Jesus says th the
[15:20] teacher you know in Israel in other
[15:23] words top he recognized him as to be a
[15:28] great
[15:29] uh
[15:31] leader he gave him a great compliment
[15:33] about him and talking about the teacher
[15:37] all right but see Jesus then but but
[15:40] Nicodemus didn't come to him just as an
[15:43] argumentive form of what that basically
[15:46] we do you know uh what do you believe
[15:49] you know uh what do you believe about
[15:51] this that or the other he came to him
[15:55] and he spoke to the man well when he
[15:57] spoke to the man
[15:59] the man didn't make anything derogatory
[16:02] as the other Pharisees and things did
[16:04] the man gave him a greater
[16:07] honor he says we
[16:10] know in other words that had to me more
[16:13] than just him amen we know that thou
[16:17] art a
[16:20] teacher because we
[16:22] recognize that you do bring us the word
[16:27] all right
[16:29] he
[16:29] said and you've got to be something
[16:32] about you that I even recognize you to
[16:36] say and call you
[16:39] Rabbi which can be many many many
[16:41] thoughts to related to calling him Rabbi
[16:45] you know of even father you know or
[16:49] different things great things but he
[16:52] said no man can do the things you
[16:56] do unless it be of
[17:00] God now that was a great compliment am
[17:04] or great thought especially in the day
[17:07] and hour when everything he would
[17:10] say 90% or more or 99% of the people
[17:15] would jump on to him about the things
[17:18] and you're a man making yourself God and
[17:21] and you know we know who you are and and
[17:23] you're born illegitimate you're you're
[17:25] this that or the other the only man that
[17:29] really gave him now even the Peter and
[17:31] all of them that followed him and and
[17:34] all of that Nicodemus was giving him a
[17:37] whole lot more greater uh
[17:41] position and placing him in a con a
[17:44] situation of bragging on him right well
[17:48] what about after all of
[17:51] that Jesus would look at him and
[17:54] say
[17:56] Nicodemus you must be born again
[18:00] y well he never heard words like that
[18:03] before right in his understanding but
[18:06] way do we get down and read a quote in a
[18:08] minute you know that brother Brown said
[18:10] Nicodemus if you hadn't just hadn't have
[18:12] stayed with your traditional
[18:15] ideas you would have know I come to die
[18:18] for the sins of
[18:22] man and see then but here's this great
[18:25] man giving all of these things and Jesus
[18:29] said you must be born
[18:32] again
[18:34] well Nicodemus didn't paraphrase it in
[18:37] the words we will and say why must I be
[18:40] born again he knew the man was talking
[18:44] about something but he couldn't
[18:45] comprehend it and so he goes to the
[18:48] Natural thought and he saids you mean
[18:50] I've got to go back into my mother and
[18:52] come out
[18:54] again and and
[18:56] Jesus kind of
[19:00] B how do you use that brated him belated
[19:03] him he he kind of went put him down a
[19:05] little bit he said you're a
[19:08] teacher and you don't understand these
[19:14] things and see Nicodemus he he couldn't
[19:17] follow it but yet see we come along and
[19:21] we say but poor Nicodemus here's a good
[19:24] Baptist you
[19:26] know poor nicod
[19:29] all he had to do is
[19:32] believe well you're not listening to the
[19:36] statements I just
[19:38] made he believed this man to be from God
[19:42] he believed this man to be a great
[19:44] teacher he even recognized him and
[19:46] called him Rabbi he would say God is
[19:48] with you he sounds like a pretty good
[19:51] believer and he did get to
[19:54] Jesus
[19:55] right come and talk to him right where
[19:58] the others wouldn't talk to him sound
[20:00] like a pretty good believer but see
[20:03] that's one of the thoughts as we'll get
[20:04] to in a minute that when you know you
[20:07] you you try to say something to people
[20:09] about the new birth
[20:15] and well I've got the new
[20:19] birth now you you'd have to be with
[20:22] understand me but you keep on you'll
[20:24] find it out brother dick I tell him
[20:25] things he'll go find him a good Baptist
[20:27] one these days and a good old Baptist
[20:29] would tell him I got the Holy Ghost I
[20:32] got the new birth he may not use the
[20:34] word Holy Ghost cuz he don't like that
[20:36] afraid of ghost you know but he may use
[20:38] the word Holy Spirit but he the reason
[20:41] he say he said the reason I've guided it
[20:43] come on to death
[20:47] Pentecost well what's that got to do
[20:51] with it you
[20:52] know right I mean did it come on the day
[20:56] of Pentecost means you got it
[21:02] so think about
[21:04] it the most religious
[21:07] sincere wonderful
[21:10] person and Jesus never brought anything
[21:13] up against him in his
[21:15] life never said a
[21:19] thing he just say you must be born again
[21:26] amen he couldn't follow that
[21:30] line right now Jesus could have reminded
[21:33] him you you remember that the the Bible
[21:37] speaks of the uh Christ
[21:40] child he would agreed with
[21:43] it he said you know he could have
[21:45] reminded him that God was going to be a
[21:48] man right you
[21:51] know he could have told him a lot of
[21:53] things and and Nicodemus would have
[21:55] agreed with
[21:57] him if you understand what I mean this
[21:59] is a sincere man coming to ask the
[22:01] question not a man that does like we
[22:05] do okay I quote brother Brandon he said
[22:08] the biggest portion of the people asked
[22:11] the question and said they're not
[22:13] listening to your answer they're waiting
[22:15] on you to shut up where they can refute
[22:18] what you said that's kind of a
[22:20] paraphrase quote it's close enough right
[22:24] but this man was very sincere very
[22:26] humble very good man
[22:30] amen and he says You must be born
[22:35] again
[22:36] now brother brand on the message you
[22:39] must be born again they can pull these
[22:40] up as we go along if they want to but I
[22:43] don't think it's necessary to that much
[22:46] but he said that this was the first
[22:48] Doctrine that's right of the Lord Jesus
[22:51] amen
[22:52] right what it you must be born again all
[22:56] right
[22:58] and he says goes on and says it's a very
[23:02] deep
[23:04] one but yet we think the new birth is
[23:06] just some shallow something it's just
[23:08] you know it's going to take us months in
[23:11] this relation to the new birth for to
[23:14] cover this so don't get dragged out on
[23:17] it if I repeat a lot of things and keep
[23:20] bringing out a lot of things because
[23:22] we're going to get into some things that
[23:24] maybe you had never tied together as to
[23:28] thinking about the New
[23:30] Birth all right and like brother
[23:33] brandham would
[23:35] say I can conclusively prove that you're
[23:38] born
[23:39] again right and then baptize into the
[23:46] body then we've got the ones we've just
[23:49] got to covering a lot where he says you
[23:51] you say you got the baptism of the Holy
[23:53] Spirit he says you can have that every
[23:55] day of your life and be
[23:56] lost right
[23:58] all
[24:00] right he says you believe unto eternal
[24:04] life
[24:07] right but you're baptized into the body
[24:10] by the Holy Spirit now those things have
[24:13] got to be brought in brought out into an
[24:16] order for us as human beings to follow
[24:19] it and to understand that all of those
[24:21] things are
[24:23] right uh we we're not ones to say we'll
[24:27] take so many these things but we won't
[24:29] take this cuz that don't sound too good
[24:32] you
[24:33] know well I the day I get to be doing
[24:37] that I'll stop quoting brother brandham
[24:39] as a
[24:40] prophet you know all
[24:42] right but just think about it the first
[24:47] doctrine that the Lord Jesus
[24:50] brought was you must be born again right
[24:53] amen all right the beginning Doctrine
[24:56] would be the most important
[25:01] one you said no it was this or that no
[25:05] there is no need of talking about them
[25:07] things until you're born again that's
[25:11] the thing that I've tried my best for
[25:13] almost 50 years of studying this message
[25:16] 40 something years as a matter of fact
[25:18] this 4th of July will be 40 years
[25:20] pastoring here that you know for all of
[25:24] that time is to try to get us away from
[25:27] this little petty ideas and thoughts and
[25:31] get down to the seriousness of God's
[25:35] word Jesus didn't say you need to be as
[25:38] we'll read the minute you ought to be
[25:40] and maybe it's okay to do it
[25:42] no he put it there and he said verily
[25:45] verily which means that anytime God says
[25:48] something double
[25:50] times you pay attention to what he's
[25:53] saying more than you the other times
[25:56] that he just says verely
[25:58] because he's emphasizing something you
[26:01] know he's bringing it out into the open
[26:04] unto you and and read the Bible for
[26:07] yourself and learn the things for your
[26:10] own you know and study the word of God
[26:14] but a very deep
[26:16] subject is you must be born
[26:21] again I think it's so deep until that's
[26:24] why most people don't preach on it right
[26:27] sure
[26:33] okay but is't it odd here comes along an
[26:37] old
[26:40] Baptist that when I started trying to
[26:42] preach about what I saw about the New
[26:44] Birth 40 or something or 50 almost 40
[26:47] something years
[26:48] ago the first sermon was that the Bride
[26:52] of Jesus Christ would be the son of
[26:55] man and that was in Athens Georgia 19
[26:58] 1969 and uh a good old
[27:03] Baptist that still believes
[27:06] in justification sanctification the
[27:10] baptism of the Holy
[27:12] Ghost you
[27:14] know and to see the
[27:17] Pentecostals of this
[27:20] message do as brother Bram said if you
[27:23] Pentecostals won't go in what did he say
[27:26] he said he'll raise up abst and
[27:29] Methodist
[27:30] right well
[27:35] okay but to see that most of the people
[27:38] of this message no longer teach
[27:40] justification sanctification the baptism
[27:42] of the Holy Ghost is the new birth
[27:43] that's right it's just some act or form
[27:47] as you do
[27:50] whatever you know or some legalistic
[27:53] form as we'll get to the end of the
[27:55] message where brother Brown
[27:59] said when it says You must be born again
[28:03] he said we want to tell the people what
[28:05] to do and not to
[28:08] do he said the Philippian Jailer didn't
[28:11] ask the question like that he ask what
[28:14] must I do to be born again he says we
[28:17] tell them what to do or not to do
[28:21] right we tell them to quit this we tell
[28:24] them to quit that not do that and do
[28:26] that
[28:28] that's not what the man asked about he
[28:30] asked how to be born
[28:33] again well now it's believe the
[28:38] message well okay that's everybody their
[28:43] own idea I still believe the same thing
[28:44] I believe back then when I came into
[28:47] this message and heard brother Brown
[28:48] talking about justification
[28:49] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[28:51] Ghost I knew immediately that I was not
[28:54] born again yet I was a deacon in a
[28:56] Baptist Church for about about fromwhere
[28:57] into 5 years I was teaching the adult
[29:00] Sunday School classes when I left from
[29:02] there which was the deacons and Elders
[29:04] the elderly people of the church that's
[29:05] what I was
[29:07] doing but yet I saw that I was not born
[29:16] again I've seen God when I was 11 years
[29:19] old I've had great experiences with God
[29:21] in my life but none of those do I count
[29:24] as the new
[29:26] birth
[29:30] okay that what most people would be glad
[29:33] to say is their evidence I don't say
[29:37] that
[29:39] amen because evidences is getting into
[29:43] attributes we'll read what the prophet
[29:45] has to say about
[29:48] it you know smoking drinking gambling
[29:51] and stuff like that it's not a sin right
[29:54] what is it it's an attribute of
[29:56] unbelief amen well why would you want to
[29:59] tell somebody something and somebody
[30:01] come up to the alar I want to be born
[30:02] again well you need to do this you need
[30:04] to do that you need to do
[30:09] that you need to quit this you need to
[30:12] believe the message well that's
[30:14] good amen
[30:17] wonderful but that's not the
[30:23] question since when have you heard
[30:25] someone preach on that you need to
[30:26] repent
[30:28] repent believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:31] repent and get
[30:34] baptized and then you need to follow the
[30:37] word and be Sanctified by the word
[30:41] that's
[30:43] right and then you need to receive the
[30:46] baptism of the Holy
[30:48] Ghost I hope everybody's got it all
[30:50] figured out how that comes to pass well
[30:53] don't okay if it's right right how would
[30:56] you like for the prophet it says it
[30:57] we'll read it in a minute he says
[30:59] there's nine over 900 different
[31:02] churches now that's that's that's way
[31:05] back and it's about that meaning the
[31:07] message
[31:08] right you understand what I mean
[31:10] doctrines and ideas right and he said if
[31:13] we ask every one of them we'd get 900
[31:17] different understandings that's
[31:21] right well all
[31:26] right but what do you put yours
[31:33] on the question
[31:35] is why must you be born again that was
[31:40] the question Nicodemus was asking in a
[31:42] simple terminologies of thinking he was
[31:46] saying I got to go back to my mother I
[31:47] got to do this would you please explain
[31:49] to me what I need to do and and the best
[31:52] that I see that I need to do is
[31:53] according to what you're teaching that
[31:55] if I was born once I need to be born
[31:57] again and and that way I need to go back
[31:59] to my mama's wound and come out again in
[32:02] simple plain language Jesus said that
[32:03] wouldn't help you you you'd come out a
[32:06] two-fold child of hell if you went back
[32:09] and could come back again it wouldn't do
[32:11] you any good but why must you be born
[32:18] again now for heaven's sakes don't lay
[32:20] it on how good you were in your
[32:26] life you know don't put it on I never
[32:30] done this or I never done
[32:33] that CU we'll go with the Apostle Paul
[32:37] and say a Pharisee of the Pharisees a
[32:40] Hebrew of the Hebrews concerning the law
[32:46] blameless but you know what he had to be
[32:48] born
[32:50] again he had to be born
[32:55] again struck down by great light y
[33:00] called it Lord
[33:04] right brother BR said he would have no
[33:06] way the man would have no way recognized
[33:08] that to be the Lord had he not known
[33:10] that's who it
[33:16] was but he winds up over there in a
[33:18] little hole somewhere and he's
[33:21] blind right until a man comes yep and
[33:25] speaks the word to him
[33:28] his eyes is opened and he receive the
[33:31] new
[33:35] birth so let's don't go on any thoughts
[33:37] or ideas if you don't get nothing out of
[33:39] the message today get that cuz that's
[33:42] what we'll be on for quite a while of
[33:43] dealing with this because you know I'm
[33:46] accused of being so deep that I bring
[33:48] out things that people can't follow
[33:51] well and let me say it the deepest thing
[33:54] this morning I can think of is you must
[33:55] be born again
[33:58] now you want me to prove that to
[34:01] you the prophet said one of the
[34:07] Mysteries in this
[34:10] day was the receiving of the new
[34:13] birth without a
[34:17] sensation we'll read in maybe this
[34:20] afternoon but it's either morning or
[34:21] afternoon where brother Brown says the
[34:23] new birth is a mystery yes it is amen
[34:26] right
[34:28] right it was so much a mystery until it
[34:32] was hidden totally to the Old Testament
[34:38] people yet we're on this side of it you
[34:40] know what they say about it Hinds side
[34:42] is 220 or something like that or you
[34:44] know you can always see behind you
[34:46] because what's been but like I started
[34:49] off while ago saying you know we can say
[34:51] all that Nicodemus had to do was believe
[34:53] the poor old fell I mean all he had to
[34:55] do was believe
[34:57] well I I would like sometimes for you to
[35:00] study Matthew Mark Luke and John and in
[35:03] that would you follow a line in Matthew
[35:06] Mark Luke and John and would you write
[35:08] down every time that it was spoken of
[35:11] about the belief that's right or
[35:13] believing or believeth that's
[35:16] right amen you
[35:20] know he that believeth in his baptized
[35:22] shall be
[35:23] saved don't say the baptism saves you
[35:27] but I wish you would just go through it
[35:29] and and write down believe believe us or
[35:32] believed or whatever when a disciples
[35:35] come along one day and they said now we
[35:36] believe and even Jesus one day referring
[35:39] do you now believe
[35:44] right they still wasn't born again come
[35:46] to run like a bunch of chickens when it
[35:48] come time for for Jesus in this
[35:50] crucifixion right right but a few days
[35:54] later they wouldn't run in at all right
[35:57] right cuz they had something that
[35:59] anchored within them
[36:01] right of their own
[36:04] experience now don't ever think that
[36:07] brother Dale believes that you can't
[36:09] have the Holy I mean that you can have
[36:11] the Holy Ghost without an experience
[36:14] you'll never find that in brother
[36:15] Brown's message I want to see it he says
[36:18] you got to have an experience but he'll
[36:21] say you can have it without a
[36:24] sensation a sensation remember according
[36:27] to
[36:29] Webster and that's the only thing we got
[36:31] to go by is a English language it means
[36:34] a sensation means an ex a a stimulation
[36:38] upon your fleshly being you know through
[36:41] your spirit of things an experience is
[36:44] something you live through yes sir amen
[36:48] all
[36:49] right I had a first
[36:52] birth I live through
[36:54] that all right
[36:57] well then what would my second birth be
[37:00] and why would I need that second birth
[37:03] well let me just read to you and let him
[37:05] let him then that way that's the reason
[37:07] I like to read a lot of the Prophet says
[37:09] to you or give you the quotes because
[37:11] that way it's not my
[37:13] words you know because on 90 90% of the
[37:17] people are not going to go look up what
[37:19] you
[37:21] say they're going to remember what they
[37:24] thought he said and they're not going to
[37:27] like I was telling them yesterday about
[37:29] it uh at church one time and I said well
[37:31] brother R said so and so and this person
[37:34] said he didn't say
[37:36] that I said well he
[37:38] did said no I just listened to that tape
[37:42] and he didn't say that I just went and
[37:45] got the book and laid it down I said
[37:46] well there's something different between
[37:47] the tape and the book because according
[37:49] to this book right here supposed to be
[37:51] that he says this well I didn't know he
[37:53] said
[37:54] that you know sometimes we sleep through
[37:58] things and it's not always sleeping
[38:00] through things it's just our mind blanks
[38:04] out no brother Dale I said glued in and
[38:08] that's when you're glued
[38:10] out because your mind doesn't work that
[38:13] way some of you're worried about dinner
[38:15] and whether your stuff's going to be any
[38:16] good today or not cuz we're going to eat
[38:18] together and all the way through the
[38:20] service you'll be concerned about
[38:22] that right that's human I do the same
[38:27] I remember brother Jeff I laughed at him
[38:29] one time he figured out how to fix a
[38:30] tractor or something listening to a
[38:33] service here at the church I said boy
[38:35] you really enjoyed it didn't you but he
[38:37] said it just come to him how to fix that
[38:40] tractor he was locked in
[38:43] good all
[38:45] right well why must you be born again
[38:49] that's
[38:52] right if your lineage is so great and
[38:55] you were wonderful and you came over on
[38:57] the May flow
[38:59] okay you know your lineage everything's
[39:02] beautiful down to there nobody committed
[39:05] any adulterous acts nobody ever had was
[39:08] no divorcement in the family no no
[39:11] things and it's all beautiful line all
[39:13] the way down for 20 Generations well
[39:16] what does it matter P are you still
[39:18] going to hit something
[39:21] but see we think there some
[39:23] reason that God saved us
[39:27] well what would be a good reason that he
[39:29] would save
[39:33] you now I know what the biggest portion
[39:36] of the message people believe he saves
[39:38] you because he put a seed in
[39:45] you well according to my
[39:49] understanding I believe what he said
[39:51] about the seed I believe that but they
[39:54] failed to quote this one that that he
[39:56] put the seat in you before the
[39:58] foundation of the
[40:01] world they don't want to quote those
[40:03] things they don't like to follow let's
[40:06] go ahead with number two and let's think
[40:07] about it off the message you must be
[40:09] born again cuz I would invite you to
[40:11] listen there's two I believe two
[40:14] messages seem like one in the 50s this
[40:16] one is 61 uh
[40:19] 12:31 uh no excuse me this one is from
[40:23] 58 uh 819 the one that we were right
[40:26] above there quoting from which says
[40:28] about two or three messages but look
[40:30] what he
[40:31] says and when Jesus said to this great
[40:36] ruler you must be born
[40:40] again then why must I be born
[40:44] again that's what I want to
[40:50] know now look at him if I'm a minister
[40:54] of the
[40:55] Gospel
[40:57] if I'm a good
[40:59] person and I pay my debts and I'm just
[41:03] and honest and walk upright before men
[41:06] what more could god require of
[41:12] me all right now relate this to
[41:15] Nicodemus in the
[41:17] situation of the great life that he was
[41:20] living but related to brother randam in
[41:22] the great life that he was
[41:25] living right
[41:27] why must I have some kind of an
[41:29] experience as people tell me that I must
[41:33] be born again why did Jesus say to this
[41:36] ruler who lived high and
[41:40] holy and was requested that now what are
[41:43] not requested but commanded that he must
[41:47] be born again
[41:51] amen great
[41:53] man but you must be born again
[42:00] look what he says on spoken word is the
[42:02] Original Seed number three of our
[42:06] thoughts paragraph
[42:09] 12122 then except a man be born
[42:12] again why must he be born
[42:15] again he's dead the flesh is
[42:20] in why must you be born again he's dead
[42:24] right the Bible says that the person
[42:26] that lives say the woman lives in
[42:27] pleasure is dead while she liveth see
[42:29] we're every one dead right amen from Eve
[42:33] sin
[42:34] right right we're born in Sin from Eve
[42:38] sin in the
[42:40] garden all right no hopes whatsoever far
[42:44] us we're born dead now watch what he
[42:47] goes on to say he's a hybrid all right a
[42:50] hybrid cannot reproduce
[42:54] itself right that's right
[42:58] it won't come back sure now okay come on
[43:00] you can take you take corn you plant it
[43:02] and a hybrid and you plant the next year
[43:04] you get a stalks you get this but you
[43:06] get old naughty looking things you don't
[43:07] get nowhere nothing right we're not so
[43:09] far off until we don't know a little bit
[43:12] but look he's a hybrid he's dead he's a
[43:16] hybrid he's got to be born again why he
[43:20] was born in Sin from Eve sin shaping in
[43:23] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[43:26] he's a liar to begin with no matter how
[43:29] smart educated what more he is he's a
[43:32] liar the Bible says he is how
[43:36] holy his parents was or anything about
[43:40] it he's a liar to begin
[43:43] with now you don't like that cuz I don't
[43:46] make it as a joke but you look down at
[43:47] that little baby that you're holding you
[43:48] say Hey Little Liar how you
[43:52] doing see you you think you're throwing
[43:54] off on the baby no no I'm throwing off
[43:56] on
[43:57] you
[43:59] okay I mean if you're going to get your
[44:00] feelings hurt for me saying something
[44:01] about you baby get your feelings hurt
[44:02] for me saying something about
[44:04] you you were the liar that brought it
[44:09] here
[44:11] right but see that doesn't have anything
[44:13] to do with
[44:14] it see that would go into what is this
[44:17] or how good or what you you can't do it
[44:19] right well look he's a
[44:24] hybrid I think I've got it in here I'm
[44:26] sure I'll use it but brother Ram said
[44:30] I'm a hybrid he said don't matter where
[44:33] you're
[44:34] priest king or who you are you're a
[44:38] hybrid now that you back up just a Hur
[44:41] you know because see your honor into
[44:44] that and that's wonderful that's all
[44:45] right but just
[44:47] remember he had to be born again that's
[44:51] right when you put it to the bases that
[44:53] brother brandom never had to be born
[44:54] again then you're making him go God
[44:56] that's right now you got your
[44:58] deities into the line cuz he was a human
[45:01] being just like the rest of us all right
[45:04] but he's a
[45:05] hybrid he was born in the eve
[45:08] sin now we we're you
[45:12] know uh we quote a lot of times
[45:15] scripture
[45:17] um when it's really a little bit offline
[45:21] from what we say born in sin sheap in
[45:23] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[45:26] that's that's not
[45:27] verbatim that's saying what it
[45:30] means because you get into Psalms 51 it
[45:34] says behold I was shapen in iniquity and
[45:37] in sin did my mother conceive me all
[45:40] right then you go into Psalms uh 58 and
[45:42] 3 The Wicked are strange from the wound
[45:45] they go astray as soon as they are born
[45:48] speaking
[45:50] lies all right
[45:53] now I thought of something Wednesday
[45:55] night I really enjoyed brother Bob's
[45:57] message and I admit I got lost in my own
[45:59] thoughts for a little while because I I
[46:02] don't say that's wrong for you to do it
[46:04] when it's in the right order cuz I was
[46:06] thinking about something that he made me
[46:10] think of you know language is an ability
[46:13] to
[46:16] communicate you know there's thousands
[46:18] of thousands of different languages in
[46:21] the world and you know God can
[46:23] understand every one of them it doesn't
[46:25] matter as brother ROM would say is they
[46:27] say goo goo gaga he said that means
[46:29] something in their language all right
[46:32] but you know language being the ability
[46:34] to
[46:36] communicate then you must understand
[46:39] what each one's doing but you know that
[46:41] person like I said there the other day
[46:43] it you know we could say in English uh
[46:46] let's go to town maybe Spanish it says
[46:48] to town we go I just you know I'm not a
[46:51] major on those things I just uh saying
[46:54] it as a point
[46:57] but you know there is a thought in the
[46:59] word of
[47:04] God that brings out God the word of God
[47:08] brings God's thoughts to whatever
[47:10] language we
[47:13] are and I remember brother uh Dan
[47:16] daisley speaking here one night it's the
[47:19] only time I've ever in my life seen
[47:20] anything to me now a talking about
[47:23] something else but brother uh
[47:27] done go I'll think of it a minute
[47:29] brother LeAndre brother from from
[47:32] Venezuela believe that's right he was
[47:35] speaking and brother daisley was
[47:37] interpreting for him well I wasn't
[47:39] following the words to be able to
[47:42] understand but I I got into the thought
[47:45] with brother LeAndre as to what he was
[47:48] saying and there was no way that I'm
[47:50] telling you this other than an honor but
[47:53] I begin brother daisley with stone for
[47:56] words and I was sitting there and I tell
[47:58] him the words to
[47:59] say and he I guess he was shocked he
[48:02] probably thought I was understanding no
[48:05] I was understanding the thought that was
[48:08] being presented
[48:11] right that way you get away from your
[48:13] own concept or what your word
[48:17] means you
[48:19] know because if you have and you know I
[48:22] make light not of people in their
[48:24] language but I I make a thought a point
[48:28] I say in English we say
[48:30] dog well what is it in
[48:33] Spanish see p petrol everything not gas
[48:37] but the P
[48:38] something what is it in Zimbabwe where
[48:42] sister
[48:44] dogy okay what is it in
[48:49] uh all right we've got about four or
[48:52] five different
[48:53] words relating
[48:56] to the word dog and that's what I asked
[48:59] everybody I say sister when you think
[49:01] are you thinking of dog and they said
[49:02] yeah I said why don't you say
[49:05] dog well they do say dog but it's their
[49:08] language that the word they
[49:11] use that means dog see it's uh It's
[49:15] ability to
[49:17] communicate because if you don't do it
[49:19] that way you're going to make the
[49:21] educated to be
[49:24] superior right and then you're falling
[49:25] out of the
[49:27] scriptures that the Common People heard
[49:29] him
[49:31] gladly he spoke their language he said
[49:33] things are s of Southern maybe as Paul
[49:36] would say you
[49:37] all you know well
[49:41] Lord great you're great for us but do
[49:45] you understand what I'm getting at all
[49:47] right now there's many ways that we're
[49:49] going to approach a thought not today
[49:53] now so I'm laying this attit time where
[49:55] you won't get when we get there you
[49:57] won't get confused and say he's doing it
[49:59] there's many ways we're going to have to
[50:01] approach this point of why you must be
[50:04] born again and
[50:06] then what is the new
[50:09] birth and and how do you know you got it
[50:12] and the evidences and things we're going
[50:14] to approach it from many different ways
[50:16] but remember my thought will be the
[50:22] same no matter if the prophet says
[50:24] you're born again baptize into the
[50:29] body in no way are we going to try to
[50:31] correct him CU that'd be stupidity
[50:35] right right but we've got to get the
[50:39] thought that's
[50:42] involved now that's the only way that I
[50:44] can go with it I'm
[50:46] sorry to not to try to change nothing
[50:49] that's what people of the message do
[50:51] brother BR said oh when was that that
[50:53] was in his early
[50:54] Ministry
[50:59] all I want is after that's not me not
[51:02] say all I want is after the seals
[51:09] broke cuz that is the spoken
[51:18] word I can take the definition of the
[51:21] new birth from 65 up and say one thing I
[51:24] can take it from 65 down or 63 down and
[51:27] say something
[51:29] else and both of them be
[51:32] correct but you'll think I'm mly
[51:37] confused see you you you think that I
[51:40] just try to be a smart elic and when
[51:42] that for many many many years and you've
[51:43] probably heard it 20 times in the past
[51:46] 27 services that where brother brandham
[51:49] would explain in his early
[51:50] Ministry Body Soul and Spirit
[51:57] but then in the later part of his
[51:58] ministry he would say Body Spirit and
[52:04] soul but he never changed the senses of
[52:08] the position that he
[52:10] brought C taste feel smelling here for
[52:12] the body second real memory reason
[52:15] conscious affections
[52:17] Etc third one was either Faith or
[52:20] doubt and see that way you can tie the
[52:23] message together through the entire
[52:25] thing you don't have to deny anything
[52:28] because most of you never came through
[52:30] the old two Soul people their point was
[52:32] always laying about the
[52:34] soul we get a New Soul that's a
[52:39] quote then you say we get a new spirit
[52:42] that's a
[52:45] quote like we were talking the other day
[52:47] about you know you you
[52:49] you well why must you be born
[52:54] again
[52:57] let's just approach it from there and go
[53:00] on well we've read that we're
[53:04] dead and according to Colossians 2:13
[53:09] and you being dead in your sins and
[53:11] uncircumcision of your
[53:13] flesh but he has to be quickened having
[53:17] forgiven you all
[53:20] trespasses so then we're dead while
[53:23] we're living right amen
[53:26] right why would God refer refer to a
[53:30] person being
[53:32] living to be proof that you're
[53:35] living and
[53:37] yet say you're
[53:40] dead well we're getting to a point it's
[53:43] pretty good now that you know that
[53:45] they're computerizing everything so much
[53:47] until it won't be long you can't prove
[53:50] it you're
[53:54] living and you you go down to the bank
[53:57] and say I'm Donnie
[54:01] faush I've come to check out some we
[54:04] have no record of Donnie
[54:08] faush according to our records and the
[54:11] Bureau of Senses we have no donif fa
[54:16] Bush and you're standing there trying to
[54:18] prove your Al and they say prove your
[54:20] alive and we'll give you
[54:23] this okay
[54:25] but
[54:28] listen High breeding brought death
[54:31] spoken words Original Seed paragraph
[54:36] 142 he said she's
[54:40] hybrid he said I'll ask you why what's
[54:42] these funerals and things about she was
[54:45] a hybrid every one of us are hybrid from
[54:48] the
[54:50] original that's the reason you're
[54:53] constantly dying
[54:56] right all
[54:57] right is because that we were born
[55:02] wrong all
[55:04] right and see even the original when we
[55:07] get into it this afternoon and where
[55:09] that that Jesus says You must be born
[55:11] again the original translation says You
[55:14] must be born from
[55:21] above but see does that change our
[55:24] thoughts
[55:26] so here it is off spoken word Original
[55:27] Seed number 7A go ahead and then pull it
[55:30] up but every man no matter whether he's
[55:32] a pope priest bishop or whatever he is
[55:36] he dies because he he he's a hybrid
[55:38] that's exactly he was born between Satan
[55:42] and
[55:44] Eve and they called it whatever you want
[55:47] to it was Satan and Eve the original
[55:52] word had nothing to do with it was a
[55:54] hybrid it brought
[55:57] death no my Mom and Daddy was
[56:01] married what that got to do with it you
[56:05] know I mean I know the point you're
[56:06] making you're trying to make a purity of
[56:10] yourself you're trying to make a lineage
[56:12] of
[56:13] yourself hey there's nobody in the
[56:15] building that love their mama anymore my
[56:17] mom raised us nine of us that even four
[56:21] died young and nine of us I'm the baby
[56:23] of 13 and she raised us you think I
[56:26] don't honor her I honored her so much
[56:29] until when she told me to be at home at
[56:31] 10:00 I was at home at
[56:34] 10:00 I can stand here and say that she
[56:37] could raise and tell you it's true I was
[56:39] late one
[56:40] time I apologized to her when I got
[56:43] home because I knew and I could hear
[56:47] her she wasn't to sleep till I went to
[56:51] bed I honor her but you know what
[56:56] my mother wouldn't a
[56:58] saint maybe you think your is
[57:01] worse and I don't mind saying it because
[57:04] I honored I just give that
[57:07] honor she could have had all kind of
[57:10] affairs with
[57:11] men well you're not talk like that about
[57:14] your mama I'm just trying to be honest
[57:17] and
[57:18] straight cuz that's the way I am is
[57:23] straight and it wouldn't matter she was
[57:25] pure and holy all the way through what a
[57:27] back behind that what a back behind
[57:30] that hey come
[57:32] on but we came over on the
[57:36] Mayflower I don't know how the Dales got
[57:38] here there probably was a stowaway on
[57:40] the ship somewhere cuz I know they
[57:41] wouldn't worth very
[57:43] much you think this the honor all I try
[57:46] to tell it like it is I say my kids what
[57:49] their Halo was held up by horns the
[57:52] grandkids are the same way the great
[57:54] grand kids are the same
[57:57] way that's not throwing off on anybody
[58:00] that's
[58:02] truth you don't know what lineage you're
[58:05] from but irregardless what does it
[58:08] matter and how great the prophet could
[58:11] speak it they were born between Satan
[58:14] and Eve now watch he never said that's
[58:17] why you don't have that you got the seed
[58:19] of the serpent you're dealing with you
[58:21] don't have the seed of the Beast right
[58:24] right it doesn't mention seed of the
[58:27] Beast come on it's the seed of the
[58:29] serpent who's the serpent
[58:32] Satan Why didn't it say well some people
[58:34] is born between Eve and the Beast but we
[58:37] were born between Eve and Adam and do
[58:40] you know that a lot of the ministers
[58:42] this message preach out
[58:45] lineages Paul said you keep lineages I'm
[58:48] scared of you all right what good is
[58:53] it
[58:56] but to realize that we're all lost and
[58:58] born between Satan and Eve do you
[59:01] realize then what he's saying and what
[59:03] the scriptures I've given to
[59:06] you in sin did my mother conceive
[59:09] me he wasn't saying that he was
[59:14] illegitimate right he knew who his daddy
[59:17] was and his mama right he was just
[59:20] saying it like it meant right repr
[59:24] uction of what the big old words y'all
[59:27] use for it I just say reproduction
[59:29] getting kids here you know that simply
[59:31] comes by a sex
[59:33] act I have never heard of anything more
[59:36] doing it other than these implants they
[59:38] have today but you know what implants
[59:40] got to come from somewhere so I don't
[59:41] make no
[59:42] difference how it gets tired ain't got
[59:45] nothing to do with it it got
[59:48] tired it had to be a a a egg from a
[59:52] woman and a seed from the man or germ or
[59:54] whatever the terminologies you use to
[59:56] bring a
[59:58] child all right they have never been
[1:00:01] able to create either one of them right
[1:00:04] because that would be a creating life
[1:00:07] they can't do it but you see we're all
[1:00:09] born between Satan and
[1:00:14] Eve and that way we don't glory in the
[1:00:17] flesh
[1:00:18] that's we know we thank God for people
[1:00:23] see right I mean for people to say that
[1:00:26] I never done this or never done that
[1:00:28] that's
[1:00:30] wonderful
[1:00:32] right but I don't save you that's right
[1:00:36] amen I can say that the only drink I've
[1:00:38] ever taken was a communion
[1:00:43] wine but that don't save
[1:00:46] me as a matter of fact it makes me on
[1:00:48] the wrong side of the situation and Paul
[1:00:52] would say of all of the great things
[1:00:54] what did he say about himself he said
[1:00:56] I'm chiefest of Sinners what does that
[1:00:58] mean to be chiefest that means you're
[1:01:00] the closest to the
[1:01:02] truth and there he was all of those
[1:01:05] great things and this great Nicodemus
[1:01:06] standing here all of those great things
[1:01:08] that Jesus never brought one thing
[1:01:10] against
[1:01:12] him and said well now Nicodemus reading
[1:01:14] you need to be born again it says
[1:01:16] because I can look back through your
[1:01:17] lineage and way back under that you
[1:01:20] don't know about but you're great great
[1:01:21] great great great great great great
[1:01:22] grandma done something wrong
[1:01:25] he didn't go through that he probably
[1:01:28] could look back through the mandoline
[1:01:29] and see that he didn't do any of it but
[1:01:32] what did that
[1:01:34] do he turned to a man and said you must
[1:01:37] be born
[1:01:39] again what about you and I amen what
[1:01:43] about
[1:01:46] it let's jump a few we'll bring them
[1:01:48] back later go over to quote number 10
[1:01:50] which is you must be born again
[1:01:53] 1961
[1:01:56] and he says now out of there there are
[1:01:57] so many different meanings that people
[1:02:00] put to it you must be born again see as
[1:02:03] it St nearly all churches say that you
[1:02:06] must be born
[1:02:08] again but each one has their their
[1:02:11] different interpretations to that what
[1:02:15] it means to be born again I might go to
[1:02:18] the Methodist church this morning they
[1:02:19] say we believe that you must be born
[1:02:21] again how do you interpret it
[1:02:24] I go to the Baptist Church we believe
[1:02:27] you must be born again how do you
[1:02:29] interpret it I would do to and I would
[1:02:33] go to each church and we'd find if we
[1:02:37] went to all 900 different denomination
[1:02:40] of churches there'd be 900 different
[1:02:48] interpretations right that's
[1:02:52] right look like a couple
[1:02:55] agree but you know the
[1:02:57] point
[1:03:00] look going on down reading what did he
[1:03:02] say now remember it didn't say you ought
[1:03:04] to be born again but you must now we as
[1:03:08] English-speaking people understand what
[1:03:10] the word must
[1:03:12] means that is it's
[1:03:14] absolutely you got to do it see it's a
[1:03:17] must not you ought to you'd be better
[1:03:21] off if you did but you must be born
[1:03:23] again amen oh if we could just take that
[1:03:26] word this morning and break it down what
[1:03:28] it means how that it's totally
[1:03:31] impossible and then if it's that
[1:03:35] essential and that great that it's
[1:03:39] totally impossible to enter the kingdom
[1:03:41] of heaven or even see it until you're
[1:03:45] born
[1:03:46] again and so many different
[1:03:48] interpretations of that word born again
[1:03:51] we ought to seek it out with all of our
[1:03:55] heart to find out what it
[1:04:01] means what does it mean you must be born
[1:04:04] again now as I said 900 different he
[1:04:07] says well then you got about
[1:04:09] 900,000 this
[1:04:11] message of all kind of
[1:04:14] ways and ideas of saying there's a
[1:04:18] reason you know you're born again is
[1:04:22] because but
[1:04:27] well let's just read the next one let
[1:04:29] him say things then you can't argue with
[1:04:30] you can argue with me you can cut me off
[1:04:32] and a little computer look what he says
[1:04:35] off the investment
[1:04:37] 1963 let not these words be in vain you
[1:04:39] must be born again you must now I'm not
[1:04:43] talking about you might scream shout
[1:04:46] speak with
[1:04:48] tongues I mean being born again now
[1:04:52] watch him really with with that deep
[1:04:55] confession of sin that's right all
[1:04:59] right let's read the next one where we
[1:05:01] get our thought Hebrews chapter 5 and
[1:05:05] six now speaking in tongues
[1:05:08] shouting in
[1:05:10] there that's just
[1:05:13] attributes that follow this kind of a
[1:05:17] life all right and you can take
[1:05:20] impersonate these
[1:05:23] attributes
[1:05:26] and never have that
[1:05:28] life we see
[1:05:31] it how many knows that's the
[1:05:34] truth surely surely we ought to know
[1:05:37] that look what he drops down to
[1:05:39] paragraph 11 141 I've seen Visions in
[1:05:43] the sick healed the dead raised when
[1:05:46] they're laying out dire and the doctors
[1:05:48] walk away and say they're finished and
[1:05:50] gone lay there a couple of hours in the
[1:05:53] Holy Spirit come right down and show a
[1:05:56] vision go down there and raise that
[1:05:58] person
[1:06:00] up I've seen those who are deaf dumb
[1:06:03] blind
[1:06:05] crippled
[1:06:07] well that's just
[1:06:11] attributes read it that's just
[1:06:14] attributes we like to talk about and
[1:06:16] we'll use it with drinking G and smoke
[1:06:18] and it just attributes it's unbelief but
[1:06:20] what does he saying all of these things
[1:06:22] that you do it's just attri
[1:06:27] Utes you cry you shout you believe you
[1:06:30] walk you do you do see the dead rais
[1:06:33] that's what he's
[1:06:38] saying he said you can impersonate any
[1:06:41] of those
[1:06:46] attributes well all
[1:06:48] right upon what basis do you put it
[1:06:52] because the Bible is saying You must be
[1:06:54] born
[1:06:56] again but why must you be born
[1:07:01] again cuz if you don't admit you need to
[1:07:04] be born again you will never be born
[1:07:07] again that's why that I've told you how
[1:07:10] many years have I made this statement I
[1:07:12] would to God I could preach a sermon
[1:07:15] that every person in this building
[1:07:17] including myself would realize if they
[1:07:20] are lost that they could say I'm lost
[1:07:23] and let me do something about it
[1:07:26] now not try to build a church up full of
[1:07:32] Sinners that's why I Don't Preach to
[1:07:34] bodies and
[1:07:37] Spirits I look you in the eye when I'm
[1:07:39] talking to you cuz I want you to look me
[1:07:42] in the eye and listen to what I'm saying
[1:07:47] right I'm not trying to discern your
[1:07:49] spirit that doesn't work right cuz if I
[1:07:54] discerned a lot of your spirits I'd be
[1:07:56] in bad shape if you discern mine you'd
[1:07:58] be in bad shape you
[1:08:01] know but why must you be born
[1:08:04] again cuz you're born
[1:08:07] wrong amen but I I'm a good person I've
[1:08:11] been a good person all of my life praise
[1:08:14] the Lord so was
[1:08:18] Nicodemus so was the great Apostle
[1:08:22] Paul
[1:08:26] but they had to be born again that's
[1:08:27] right so was brother brandham don't
[1:08:29] smoke Don't drink don't chew cuz it'll
[1:08:32] work for you one
[1:08:34] day but he didn't have any trouble
[1:08:37] explaining that he had to be born again
[1:08:40] and even the things that he would say
[1:08:42] and I will admit there are a lot of
[1:08:45] statements that must be put together
[1:08:48] because one time he'll be in the
[1:08:50] Woodshed the next time we'll be running
[1:08:52] down the railroad track
[1:08:55] the next time he'll be doing this or
[1:08:57] that or the other there are different
[1:08:58] ways he would speak of his new
[1:09:00] birth because that's just PL doings
[1:09:04] talking you know you tell me something
[1:09:07] one day and the next day you'll tell me
[1:09:09] something you'll add a few words to it
[1:09:11] or leave out a few words right that's
[1:09:14] human
[1:09:16] beings but see none of those his
[1:09:19] shouting speaking running down the
[1:09:21] railroad track none of that was his new
[1:09:22] birth right right that was
[1:09:27] attributes he wasn't against shouting
[1:09:30] right he was not against speaking in
[1:09:32] tongues he was not against crying and
[1:09:34] screaming and all of those things he
[1:09:37] believed in them every one of them he
[1:09:39] said he done every one of
[1:09:42] them but he never put any of
[1:09:45] it as to be his new
[1:09:50] birth a baby is born it's is
[1:09:54] born is alive then it starts
[1:10:00] crying
[1:10:01] right starts screaming starts doing why
[1:10:05] those are just attributes of an alive
[1:10:08] baby that's not your
[1:10:14] birth the birth was when the baby got
[1:10:19] here spank it or whatever and it come to
[1:10:22] life but then it does those
[1:10:27] things well brother Dale you're trying
[1:10:29] to tell me I'm lost if I can convince
[1:10:32] you brother Al can I quote brother you
[1:10:34] brother Al brother Al said I wish you'd
[1:10:36] go up part to brother Dale and let him
[1:10:37] talk you out of your what you think you
[1:10:41] know God if you can talk you out of it
[1:10:43] you don't know
[1:10:44] it I ain't hindering nobody that's born
[1:10:47] again that's right and the ones that
[1:10:49] would hinder is proving you're not born
[1:10:52] again
[1:10:54] see if you're having doubts about things
[1:10:56] because of what I'm saying to you then
[1:10:59] you're the one that's got the
[1:11:01] problem and you need to work on
[1:11:05] it you need something to where you can
[1:11:07] say this is my
[1:11:10] experience let me anchor down
[1:11:13] here do we want to profit he said take a
[1:11:16] steak drive it downen sir see then you
[1:11:20] can say Satan do what you want to
[1:11:24] that took place back there here's the
[1:11:26] date here's the time here's what done
[1:11:28] now you just go
[1:11:30] on and if it's real he'll go on but if
[1:11:33] it ain't he going to make you do
[1:11:35] everything in the
[1:11:36] world but do you understand why you must
[1:11:39] be born
[1:11:41] again cuz you're born
[1:11:44] wrong
[1:11:46] am right Born
[1:11:51] wrong you're dead
[1:11:55] that's why I've always tried to get you
[1:11:57] to see those things that those Old
[1:11:59] Testament
[1:12:01] Saints no matter how great they
[1:12:04] were and honorable right they needed to
[1:12:08] be born again
[1:12:11] right amen right
[1:12:14] amen all right then we go over in
[1:12:17] scripture because it says that that
[1:12:19] Jesus had not been you know the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost had not been given all right
[1:12:23] that's Wonder we got the quotes we've
[1:12:25] got the thought but why not take it in
[1:12:28] plain simple
[1:12:31] language he that is born of a
[1:12:35] woman is full of Sorrows right troubles
[1:12:41] and but hey thank God we got here yeah
[1:12:46] right right amen and I wouldn't care I
[1:12:49] don't I don't mean this to derogatory to
[1:12:50] my mother or water I wouldn't care if if
[1:12:53] if I was illegitimate all the way back
[1:12:56] to the Garden right
[1:12:58] amen amen if every parent I had leading
[1:13:03] back went straight to Cain boy the
[1:13:06] preacher this message I hear him on that
[1:13:08] he don't believe in the no I don't
[1:13:11] believe in all that garbage you talk
[1:13:12] about that's right
[1:13:14] amen amen I believe the Bible that said
[1:13:18] to Cain would you not have been received
[1:13:22] if you'll go do what your brother done
[1:13:25] I'll accept you now you go read the
[1:13:28] Bible and see what it says but see no no
[1:13:31] we we're so
[1:13:33] holy my lineage come on it's been in the
[1:13:36] message you that been around a while you
[1:13:38] know what I'm saying true they've always
[1:13:40] brought two lineages absolutely a
[1:13:43] lineage coming from Adam a lineage
[1:13:46] coming from the Beast through Cain
[1:13:50] that's right and if you was born of
[1:13:54] Adam you can be saved but if you born
[1:13:58] from the cane you can't be saved now
[1:14:02] that's the biggest garbage can that
[1:14:03] could ever be amen that's right
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:10] amen because you'd be B Mak it on the
[1:14:13] basis of who my mom and daddy happened
[1:14:14] to be you wouldn't be giving me a choice
[1:14:19] righten and even my mom and daddy would
[1:14:21] give a choice Adam and Eve that's right
[1:14:24] right sure but you'd be making me to
[1:14:26] worth
[1:14:27] it so you're not seeing why you must be
[1:14:30] born
[1:14:31] again you're trying to make it so holy
[1:14:35] the reason I come into this message I
[1:14:37] never done like
[1:14:39] you if I had done the things you done
[1:14:43] the Lord would have never saved
[1:14:45] me oh it's wonderful isn't it you
[1:14:50] remember the story that I told you one
[1:14:52] time about the man that told me that I
[1:14:55] kept trying to get him to get baptized
[1:14:57] he finally got baptized in the name of
[1:14:58] the Lord Jesus Christ but he talked to
[1:15:01] his wife and she wasn't going to do
[1:15:04] it and she wound up saying that God come
[1:15:08] in the hospital room and poured water
[1:15:10] over her and baptized her in the name of
[1:15:13] the Lord Jesus Christ because he didn't
[1:15:16] know now this is the word because God
[1:15:19] didn't know whether she was going to
[1:15:20] live or not to be able to go out and get
[1:15:23] back baptized now that's what the man
[1:15:28] said and I don't care if he went there
[1:15:30] in the bed was floa I don't care if the
[1:15:32] room was full of
[1:15:36] water so
[1:15:39] I being the mean God that I am I asked
[1:15:43] him a simple
[1:15:45] question I said in other words you say
[1:15:47] you're wife says that God baptized her
[1:15:49] he said yes that's right I said now
[1:15:51] brother if if I come to you and told you
[1:15:54] this story most of you know what I'm
[1:15:56] saying some of you know who it
[1:16:00] was I said if I come and told you this
[1:16:03] story that my wife said God come in a
[1:16:06] hospital room and poured water over her
[1:16:08] and baptized
[1:16:11] her I said would you believe my wife was
[1:16:14] right he said no brother I just don't
[1:16:18] think I could believe your
[1:16:20] wife I just never did talk to him no
[1:16:23] more you know why because his wife was a
[1:16:27] woman preacher whether she ever preached
[1:16:28] a sermon or not she doesn't preach the
[1:16:30] doctr to him the same way Eve did in the
[1:16:33] garden and he was not going to go
[1:16:36] against her that's
[1:16:39] right right he believed her but he
[1:16:41] wouldn't believe my
[1:16:44] wife you see
[1:16:47] 97 different
[1:16:49] ways of trying to answer the question
[1:16:53] that you must be born
[1:16:57] again from shouting to speaking in
[1:16:59] tongues to crying to seeing Vision
[1:17:03] seeing
[1:17:05] Angels speaking the word of the
[1:17:08] Lord do you realize that in the Psalms
[1:17:12] that
[1:17:13] it's actually the prophets were speaking
[1:17:17] as the personal
[1:17:20] God right
[1:17:24] the psalmist David Solomon one the two
[1:17:26] what would he cry they pierced my hands
[1:17:28] and my feet you remember the Ethiopian
[1:17:30] unic you remember he said this man
[1:17:31] talking about himself as he speaking
[1:17:33] about
[1:17:35] another right speaking to first person
[1:17:38] and still be lost as far as the
[1:17:42] humanity cuz old Those Old Testament
[1:17:44] Saints could not be born
[1:17:49] again because you got to have the death
[1:17:51] of the testator right it's like I was
[1:17:54] you know I say this to you and I don't
[1:17:56] do it to be funny or anything like that
[1:17:58] I say to most people say turn to the
[1:18:00] first book of the New Testament some of
[1:18:03] you would probably even do it right now
[1:18:04] you'd turn to Matthew and want to read
[1:18:05] it to
[1:18:10] me that ain't the first book of the New
[1:18:12] Testament the first book of the New
[1:18:14] Testament is the book of
[1:18:16] Acts because in Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:18:18] John the testator had not
[1:18:21] died there was no new birth even though
[1:18:25] he breathed on them at the end right in
[1:18:28] the last days he breathed on them and
[1:18:30] said receive you the Holy
[1:18:33] Ghost but it was not given P until
[1:18:39] Pentecost the New Testament started on
[1:18:41] the day of Pentecost that's why Jesus
[1:18:44] told the
[1:18:47] people come
[1:18:49] on Jesus told the people in the gospels
[1:18:52] right to go offer the sacrifice of
[1:18:56] Moses am I in the
[1:18:59] Bible read Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:19:02] you might find a lot of other things
[1:19:03] that's right read it for yourself he
[1:19:07] said go offer the offering of
[1:19:12] Moses go wash in the pool go do
[1:19:20] this right
[1:19:24] because he was still under the law
[1:19:26] himself that's right the Bible said he
[1:19:28] came under the law to redeem them that
[1:19:31] were under the law that we may be able
[1:19:33] to be the children of God paraphrasing
[1:19:36] the last part
[1:19:40] right but see we think it was just
[1:19:43] believing we'll get to that one too it's
[1:19:46] just
[1:19:50] believing
[1:19:51] well
[1:19:56] when I say unto you you must be born
[1:19:59] again what do you say
[1:20:01] back I've done this I've done that now
[1:20:05] let me end the last one with a quote
[1:20:06] from the
[1:20:09] prophet he said that
[1:20:12] Cain offered his
[1:20:15] sacrifice you know and he believed what
[1:20:17] he was bringing was the correct one and
[1:20:19] he says it one day like this about Cain
[1:20:22] he said Cain said to
[1:20:24] God I've done all I'm going to
[1:20:30] do he said take it or leave
[1:20:36] it now that enough was enough to let you
[1:20:39] know what kind of a spirit he had amen
[1:20:44] right in the face of God to say take it
[1:20:47] or leave it come on
[1:20:49] Brothers I've done all I'm going to do
[1:20:55] I've offered my sacrifice you set for me
[1:20:58] to do it I've done
[1:21:02] it that's why I love the scriptures
[1:21:05] where it says you know
[1:21:11] that you're not you're paraphrasing but
[1:21:14] it says you're your offerings your
[1:21:17] things has become a stink in my
[1:21:20] nostrils I don't look to
[1:21:23] that he said but I look to a man with
[1:21:27] with an honest and a contrite
[1:21:30] heart what's the difference in
[1:21:33] David committing adultery or anybody
[1:21:36] else committing
[1:21:40] adultery but yet Joe Blow as we call him
[1:21:44] was killed because of what he
[1:21:48] done but
[1:21:50] David Nathan himself had to speak
[1:21:53] it but he said David you call down your
[1:21:57] own
[1:21:58] judgment cuz David said bring the man in
[1:22:00] other words I'll kill
[1:22:03] him he said You' brought your own
[1:22:07] judgment but said you won't
[1:22:13] die he said God done told me you ain't
[1:22:17] going to
[1:22:17] die amen well what was so good about
[1:22:20] David oh he was a
[1:22:29] God I've always love David because of
[1:22:31] one
[1:22:33] thing he had an honest and a contrite
[1:22:37] heart scoi even verifies the same thing
[1:22:40] brother brandham said maybe that's where
[1:22:41] he got he said that David on his way
[1:22:43] home from the bed with basba cried out
[1:22:46] in his heart return unto me the joy of
[1:22:50] thy
[1:22:51] salvation
[1:22:56] he had that honest and a contrite
[1:23:00] heart cuz there was no way to take away
[1:23:02] the nature that was within the
[1:23:04] man he went back and had a dozen more
[1:23:07] kids out of women he capture from
[1:23:08] different people and done all kind of
[1:23:10] dirty
[1:23:11] things but yet in the Bible he's called
[1:23:13] a man after God's Own
[1:23:17] Heart I'd rather see somebody that's
[1:23:19] honest and
[1:23:20] straight than to see all the goodness we
[1:23:23] could
[1:23:26] do because we're still all
[1:23:28] facing why must we be born again l 10
[1:23:33] because we were born
[1:23:37] wrong born lost go ahead brother 206

[1:23:44] going to eat
[1:23:51] together

[1:29:12] it was back
[1:29:15] there in the book of
[1:29:19] Acts it took the disciples
[1:29:22] three and a half
[1:29:24] years to come to a place of being
[1:29:28] Believers to come to a place of being
[1:29:32] Sanctified cleansed and set
[1:29:35] aside to where they could receive the
[1:29:38] new
[1:29:41] birth yet they had raised the dead
[1:29:43] healed the sick cast out Devils even
[1:29:47] Judas was a part of that
[1:29:50] Ministry
[1:29:54] but yet he failed to make it to
[1:30:00] Pentecost well Judas just couldn't be
[1:30:11] saved upon what do you Bas
[1:30:18] it
[1:30:20] save
[1:30:24] hear my AR
[1:30:32] more
[1:30:34] why on others
[1:30:48] down amen and amen and amen white tells
[1:30:52] me they're getting together a good bit
[1:30:54] of money to be able to send to the
[1:30:56] Philippines and things to help those
[1:30:58] people and we thank you for all that
[1:31:00] you're doing to try to help and to do
[1:31:02] and and all to uh you know to help those
[1:31:05] brothers and sisters and what they're
[1:31:08] doing if you ever went to some of those
[1:31:09] countries and see it even the ones that
[1:31:12] are here that live there uh you know
[1:31:16] maybe they don't see it like we see it
[1:31:18] because they live there and they don't
[1:31:21] think much of about it but you go there
[1:31:23] and see them and the way they lived and
[1:31:25] the way they're doing and then you come
[1:31:27] back home and and you just want
[1:31:32] to had three three full luggages going
[1:31:35] to Jamaica the first
[1:31:37] time clothes packed everything was tight
[1:31:41] candy to the kids but still a lot of it
[1:31:44] was three-piece luggage you know big and
[1:31:47] you know I came back without one stitch
[1:31:50] of clothing
[1:31:54] well I said did you even give away your
[1:31:56] underclothes I said they got washing
[1:31:59] machines they can wash them I gave away
[1:32:02] everything I
[1:32:05] had because when you see them to
[1:32:10] think that they have no opportunity like
[1:32:13] we
[1:32:14] do and see them to be poor people but
[1:32:17] yet to be good
[1:32:20] people happy people
[1:32:23] it's no joke to what they say that in
[1:32:25] the Philippines if you see a man with a
[1:32:27] frown on his face that he's faking
[1:32:29] it because they're happy
[1:32:33] people Jamaica they're happy people but
[1:32:36] I did see some standing there that I
[1:32:39] looked at him and I
[1:32:44] cried I could see in their eyes no
[1:32:49] hopes I said brother r
[1:32:53] please please take the gospel to these
[1:32:58] people cuz they don't have no hope
[1:33:01] whatsoever in anything
[1:33:05] else take the gospel to
[1:33:08] him if you've never done that to be able
[1:33:11] to look in the set of eyes of a person
[1:33:13] that has no hopes and then look in
[1:33:16] comparison to a person that has Jesus
[1:33:18] Christ in their heart you can see an
[1:33:20] entirely difference
[1:33:22] if you're even spiritual at all you can
[1:33:25] see that they do have hopes and thoughts
[1:33:28] where others has none that's right you
[1:33:31] just want to give everything away to try
[1:33:34] to help them that's
[1:33:37] right come that's just the way it
[1:33:40] is you think about
[1:33:43] it God keeps up and knows who's helpen
[1:33:46] with what we do too and we thank you for
[1:33:50] the needs and the helps
[1:33:52] you know amen and the things that we've
[1:33:54] been able to do over the years to be
[1:33:56] able to send thousands of thousands of
[1:33:59] dollars to the foreign field that's
[1:34:00] right to help those
[1:34:02] people that we could have took and stuck
[1:34:04] it in our pocket and bought a new
[1:34:07] car you know but yet we had never chose
[1:34:11] to do
[1:34:13] that he just chose to try to exist as
[1:34:17] well we can and we do
[1:34:20] good but to go back and see those
[1:34:22] countries after you there the first time
[1:34:24] and then go back years later and see
[1:34:26] them and just just to see how the econom
[1:34:29] is a little
[1:34:31] better the first time we were in Jamaica
[1:34:34] man you were riding in cars with no
[1:34:35] shocks you
[1:34:37] just and there wasn't no door handles
[1:34:39] cuz it' all been knocked off there
[1:34:40] wasn't any mirrors on them and you'd
[1:34:42] just be going somewhere and the thing
[1:34:44] would get hot and it have to stop and
[1:34:45] put water in or do something or probably
[1:34:48] you know get on a little further and and
[1:34:51] you never seen it to where they be
[1:34:52] running on tires that I told you about I
[1:34:55] saw the tires on a car one night when
[1:34:57] they drove in and I thought that's a
[1:34:59] funny look I've never seen a tire like
[1:35:01] that and there was things sticking out
[1:35:04] the side of the tire you know and it was
