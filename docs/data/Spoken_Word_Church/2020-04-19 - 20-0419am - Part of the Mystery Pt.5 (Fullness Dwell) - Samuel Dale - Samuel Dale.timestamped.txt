[4:52] that something that's the outside some

[5:25] turning in your scripture turn to mark 4
[5:28] in Leviticus 23 we'll read mark 4 in
[5:32] Leviticus 23 I want to try to carry our
[5:35] thought on I'm trying to get to a
[5:38] position for us to think on some things
[5:42] and I'm hoping that what its dwelling in
[5:45] is what the Prophet said and he said
[5:47] when the bride realizes who she is and
[5:51] what she's doing here of what she's here
[5:54] for
[5:55] said she'd be an invincible army well
[5:57] alright we just keep believing who we
[6:00] are and keep accepting what the word
[6:02] says we are and I pray that the thought
[6:07] went across there I've mentioned it a
[6:09] couple of times you know Wade preached
[6:12] back yonder on earth you know he said we
[6:14] we talked about Abraham but said you
[6:16] know it's it's us they look back there
[6:20] and see yourself read yourself all the
[6:22] way through the Bible
[6:24] when you see Moses and what happened
[6:27] read yourself there and see what's
[6:29] happened and see what's taking place now
[6:31] and come right on out to the very hour
[6:33] that we're living in the word
[6:36] the Lord Jesus we thank you for this day
[6:39] and your grace and we pray that you
[6:41] would just bless us together in you and
[6:44] as we ask that you would be with each
[6:46] and every one they were the ones outside
[6:47] Lord that are listening in today and and
[6:51] being able to view the services and
[6:53] things thank you for them coming and
[6:55] taking their time Lord because they
[6:58] don't have to they could sit at home and
[7:00] do these but some choose to come in
[7:03] fellowship so we pray that you would
[7:05] just bless each one because it's it's a
[7:07] hard thing to not be able to go to
[7:09] church and and Lord that's hurting her
[7:12] our very beings of everything because
[7:15] we've always just been ready to go it
[7:17] wouldn't no thought about it it was just
[7:19] already gone we'd already dire we didn't
[7:22] care about anything else we ask you now
[7:24] to just have your way be with the sick
[7:26] ones among us we were brother our Lord
[7:29] and just touch him and remember the
[7:31] hounds sister Aldrin Lord never brother
[7:33] Dale it's just a Mary dougherty there
[7:36] Lord be with her brother Colley and just
[7:39] bless each and every one of all together
[7:41] in you in Jesus name Amen
[7:47] mark forward
[7:50] begin verse 26 and
[7:53] he said so is the kingdom of God as
[7:58] if a man should cast seed into the
[8:02] ground
[8:02] and should sleep and rise night and day
[8:06] and the seed should spring and grow up
[8:10] he knoweth not how
[8:13] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[8:16] herself first the blade then the ear
[8:20] after that to full corn in the ear but
[8:24] when the fruit is brought forth
[8:26] immediately he put us in the sickle
[8:28] because the harvest is coming ok we'll
[8:31] go to Leviticus
[8:34] to pick up her point and just go with
[8:38] this weights been covered knees so we
[8:40] just reviewed a lot of it but we're
[8:42] going to Leviticus 23:10
[8:47] speaking to the children of Israel and
[8:49] say unto them when you come into the
[8:51] land which I give unto you and shall
[8:53] reap the harvest there then you shall
[8:56] bring a of the firstfruits of your
[8:59] harvest
[9:00] unto the priest and he shall wave the
[9:03] sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for
[9:06] you on the Marah I've through the
[9:09] Sabbath the priest shall wave it and ye
[9:13] shall offer that day when you wave the
[9:16] sheaf a lamb without blemish of the
[9:19] first year for a burnt offering unto the
[9:23] Lord you may be seated the Lord that is
[9:26] blessing to the reading of the word now
[9:28] remember here in Leviticus we just
[9:31] mention it if you notice it's talking
[9:35] about the sheath wave and we'll get back
[9:37] to that but there's always a there's an
[9:39] offering that goes with that
[9:41] the you know there was an offerings and
[9:44] it was a lamb it was offering there's
[9:46] always in those type of things there is
[9:49] an offering to be made you know by the
[9:52] people in doing it so to me I think the
[9:58] greatest offering that you and I could
[9:59] make according to the Bible is
[10:01] presenting our bodies of living
[10:04] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the
[10:07] Lord which is our reasonable service
[10:09] alright so as we come to understanding
[10:13] about the sheath waves and the things
[10:15] and what happened back there in the
[10:17] natural we see and we don't forget that
[10:20] sacrifice it went with it our the
[10:23] offering that went with it you know and
[10:25] that's what we're to be an our day and
[10:28] to see the hour that we're living so
[10:31] we'll get back to those things kind of
[10:33] end to the message alright now we've
[10:35] recovered
[10:37] we covered last Sunday on the Easter
[10:40] time but
[10:42] the service before that we were covering
[10:45] we were talking about the son of man or
[10:49] the revealing of the Son of Man and I
[10:52] pray that this will help you and you
[10:56] know I want to keep reading some things
[10:57] because I want you to think about it
[11:02] alright now we we went through in the
[11:07] son of man and dealing with it you know
[11:10] that you got in in God you got the three
[11:12] that the son of man son of God son of
[11:15] David all right so then in the son of
[11:18] man is the Old Testament dealing of the
[11:21] prophets each one of those were son of
[11:24] man all right now they were not the son
[11:29] of man
[11:30] they were a son of man all right that
[11:34] the son of man was speaking through now
[11:36] I want you to do it and I'm gonna repeat
[11:38] this in a minute where you'll remember
[11:40] it remember the prophets all said thus
[11:44] saith the Lord
[11:47] all right which meant
[11:51] it wasn't them
[11:54] they were saying what something was
[11:57] telling them to say
[11:59] all right and bringing it down to
[12:02] personal to getting to the contact all
[12:06] right and they would say thus says the
[12:08] Lord but Jesus never said thus saith the
[12:10] Lord
[12:11] he was the Lord all right see now if
[12:15] you'll tie together and keep it in the
[12:18] correct order of understanding you'll
[12:20] follow the message out and see what you
[12:23] know what the Prophet is talking about
[12:25] that the Son of Man was the Old
[12:28] Testament the prophets
[12:30] all right that was the the father's
[12:33] dispensation as we call it you know God
[12:38] back there with those people speaking
[12:40] through the prophets because they chose
[12:44] that they remember to Moses they chose
[12:47] it they said we don't want God to speak
[12:50] no more so we want you to speak so he
[12:53] said okay from now it'll come through
[12:56] the Prophet the Prophet would bring the
[12:59] word alright not leaving out the father
[13:01] of the Old Testament because that would
[13:03] be the very father himself the Creator
[13:06] God and it's like I told you there on
[13:09] that last message I was preaching on
[13:10] this that isn't it amazing that in the
[13:14] Old Testament you have the Creator God
[13:16] the word
[13:18] alright that's who it was who was the
[13:21] creator the
[13:23] word created all things alright and the
[13:27] word is you know the son of man
[13:31] was the word himself because he come on
[13:34] over in the scriptures and him Gordon
[13:36] the prophet said who is this on a man he
[13:38] said in the beginning was the word word
[13:39] with garden the Word was God that's the
[13:42] son of man alright so then when you're
[13:44] dealing with the Old Testament you can
[13:46] look at it as son of man that's under
[13:49] the father the dispensation and you can
[13:51] see and go all the way back and I hope
[13:53] you followed the point that's making
[13:55] little little statements
[13:58] let's see then
[14:00] the word being the Creator who created
[14:02] over the world and mankind and the
[14:05] angels and thing the word
[14:07] who the Son of Man the Son of Man the
[14:11] word
[14:12] the Creator God well then you come over
[14:16] to the Gospels and you read how that the
[14:18] Son of Man is the sower of the seed
[14:22] well see if there's any creation it has
[14:25] to deal with son of man
[14:28] right son of man so I hope you put that
[14:32] into your log book and keep it with you
[14:35] to think about then you can watch the
[14:37] creation coming down through the Old
[14:38] Testament and coming out and the climax
[14:43] or thoughts of the Old Testament came
[14:46] forth into the creation of the Son of
[14:49] Man in human flesh the word
[14:53] John 1:14
[14:55] the that was made flesh and dwelt among
[14:58] us and there stood all mighty God in
[15:01] human flesh the Son of man
[15:05] all right so he didn't have to speak
[15:08] thus saith the Lord
[15:10] he was the Lord and what he said was
[15:14] that part and if you're thinking it and
[15:16] keep it up maybe shouldn't mention it
[15:18] but if you'll keep your mind in the
[15:20] correct talk of looking at flesh and
[15:24] seeing that that cedar learn because to
[15:27] me it gets down to brother Branham
[15:29] see brother Branham come to the point
[15:32] because that's what I'm trying to get
[15:34] all of us to come to to see brother
[15:36] Branham come to the point to bring in
[15:38] the Son of Man and he spoke thus saith
[15:42] the Lord
[15:43] because it was the Lord giving the word
[15:45] to him to speak but then he says now
[15:50] it's not what I say
[15:53] you remember there in the scripture he
[15:56] says what you say
[15:58] alright see then if you'll take it I
[16:02] said real carefully so you can follow
[16:04] Moses down to actually Moses wound up
[16:09] speaking the very words of God
[16:12] riding the Bible rain in all of those
[16:15] things and a lot of times he didn't say
[16:17] thus says the Lord he he'd lean over to
[16:19] to maybe to Aaron and Aaron would say
[16:23] thus saith the Lord see Aaron never said
[16:26] let it be let it be Aaron was the
[16:30] prophet so the prophets going to deal
[16:32] with thus saith the Lord
[16:35] all right and that means God is speaking
[16:40] to you to tell you that's a wonderful
[16:43] thing to think about all the things that
[16:45] brother Branham spoken and said that's
[16:47] the staff the Lord
[16:49] in order to show you what I'm talking
[16:51] about see then men remember who was it
[16:54] sister Hattie right when or wonder of
[16:58] them there you know when he told him to
[17:00] say it they stuttered like in other
[17:02] words they paused a little bit and he
[17:04] says that's thus saith the Lord will see
[17:07] they called it
[17:08] because they could could hang on to the
[17:11] staff the Lord because they'd heard him
[17:13] down through his ministry
[17:14] speaking thus saith the Lord but did it
[17:16] come to a time
[17:19] no come on it came to a time that the
[17:23] word as they begin to unfold through the
[17:25] Prophet
[17:28] when he got into the seals he'd be
[17:30] preaching alone he say now that's thus
[17:33] saith the Lord see he wanted to keep
[17:35] your mind in the point of knowing where
[17:38] it was coming from but in that opening
[17:40] of the seals was bringing forth the word
[17:42] that had never been brought before
[17:46] the same creator that was back tyre
[17:50] the same one that stood back the artist
[17:53] said let there be and the world came
[17:55] into being which was the Word of God
[17:58] the Son of man
[18:01] stood then on earth
[18:04] the brought forth by the prophets right
[18:08] I'm off the message forgive me
[18:12] see the prophets built the body
[18:17] right John came to introduce the head
[18:22] then the Lord Jesus came to be the head
[18:25] of that see that's why those prophets
[18:27] then would thus saith the Lord because
[18:31] we were building the body but when Jesus
[18:34] came he didn't have to say that because
[18:36] he was the Lord Himself to speak the
[18:39] word brother Branham starts out son of
[18:42] man what does say if the Lord sure God
[18:46] used it thousands of thousands of times
[18:48] through the Ministry of the process then
[18:50] all at once he says now I say
[18:55] see his ministry begin to change
[18:58] he said I'm looking for this great thing
[19:00] to come and people missed it because
[19:03] they were looking for something to
[19:05] physically happen you know things and
[19:07] then you know all that they were had in
[19:09] their mind it's got to take place and
[19:11] this was going to be and that's going to
[19:12] be instead of looking at what he was
[19:14] saying
[19:15] his ministry changed just as it did
[19:19] there was Moses could say thus saith the
[19:21] Lord but then one day Moses wrote the
[19:24] entire book of the Old Testament
[19:27] and he didn't have to write the staff
[19:30] the Lord thus saith the Lord it was the
[19:32] Lord just come down so much and engulfed
[19:34] the man until he and the man became one
[19:38] tool even what did the Prophet say he
[19:40] said I used to wonder about how that
[19:42] Moses could tell God a better way of
[19:44] doing something he said till I seen it
[19:46] was Christ in Moses now that wasn't the
[19:49] staff the Lord
[19:51] see when it comes to the Christ in Moses
[19:54] he didn't have to say thus saith the
[19:55] Lord he could say it and then come to
[19:57] Paes
[19:59] keep that in mind
[20:01] because that's what I'm talking about
[20:04] the bride of Jesus Christ
[20:11] see it's left in our hands sometimes
[20:14] until actually God leaves it to you and
[20:17] you can you could actually say something
[20:20] you ever had something so real until you
[20:23] could you could actually say thus saith
[20:24] the Lord oh
[20:26] no no no we're not well I'm thus saith
[20:30] the Lord I've Illustrated through when
[20:33] we're talking about Jesus
[20:36] was the Lord he didn't have to say that
[20:41] the prophets had to say thus saith the
[20:43] Lord because that was God speaking
[20:45] through them
[20:46] right
[20:48] okay now what are we talking about when
[20:51] we get to mark 11 or whatever it is into
[20:54] what we've quoting our moment ago when
[20:56] it says if you say if you say to this
[20:59] mountain
[21:01] he said not if I didn't brother branham
[21:03] I got it laying right here on the
[21:05] message speak to this mountain he said
[21:08] not if I say but if you say
[21:13] they speak the word
[21:15] that's too strong well don't worry about
[21:19] it if it ain't the word it ain't gonna
[21:21] work
[21:23] but at least you can step out on
[21:25] something every once in a while to begin
[21:27] to think a little bit about it and
[21:28] that's what I'm talkin about the Bride
[21:30] of Christ if the bride is part of the
[21:33] mystery from Christ the minister of God
[21:36] revealed all God was reporting the cross
[21:38] all Christ into the church and she's
[21:41] part of the mystery and must be revealed
[21:44] then being part of the mystery sees then
[21:47] it would be identically to the other
[21:49] ministries of the Bible it's not adding
[21:53] to or taken away yeah but but brother I
[21:55] we can see brother Branham now on
[21:57] whether the said well can you see
[21:59] brother ran him with a I say
[22:05] cuz he would actually as I said a lot of
[22:08] times he had to say that's that's thus
[22:10] saith the Lord to knock people back to a
[22:13] position that they would believe it
[22:15] because they had lost what he was doing
[22:18] but he was standing there saying I
[22:22] say I
[22:26] say
[22:28] no no that's nice too strong for - now
[22:31] you're getting on the wrong side of the
[22:33] car you know the thing go now you're
[22:36] you're beginning to doubt your prophet
[22:38] being able to say it
[22:42] but just remember that if you look at it
[22:45] correctly you'll say that's what I said
[22:47] about the Bible look at Moses back there
[22:50] who was that it told Moses now
[22:54] told Moses what happened in the garden
[23:00] but he wasn't sitting down her writings
[23:02] in well yo huh yeah that's dust saith
[23:06] the Lord okay no he and God had become
[23:11] so close
[23:13] Moses and God was so close together
[23:15] until it was this one person and
[23:20] he could write what happened right there
[23:22] in the garden
[23:24] that's what I told my brother he was he
[23:27] was talking one time about you know how
[23:29] that we use making too much of this at
[23:31] the end you know you can't I said if
[23:33] you'll just tell me what told Moses what
[23:36] happened in the garden wings solve the
[23:37] whole problem
[23:39] as there will be no argument me and you
[23:41] about the word just tell me who told
[23:43] Moses to write five books of
[23:46] course you know what that done cuz
[23:48] they're smart what most it's getting
[23:50] right before
[23:52] see trying to trap you out that don't go
[23:54] me off
[23:55] when it's four or five don't throw me
[23:57] off a lot of people
[24:00] Moses they're arguing about it and they
[24:02] do the the the
[24:05] religious rim argues over where the
[24:07] Moses wrote four books or five books
[24:09] maybe I shouldn't tell you that but
[24:12] what's it matter
[24:13] if they wrote two I
[24:17] still want them to
[24:19] you know just wrote one
[24:22] but get what I'm talking about you go
[24:25] back and you take what I'm trying to say
[24:28] to you and have been in the past few
[24:30] services trying to get you to see what
[24:32] you are and seeing it from where you
[24:35] come from from the Old Testament
[24:40] that Great Creator created the world
[24:44] and that was what was so amazing see
[24:47] when brother Branham made a statement he
[24:50] said it was the Sun that created
[24:55] but then he tells you real quickly that
[24:58] sunny is the word the word
[25:01] the word created I
[25:05] see the Son of man standing back they're
[25:08] saying let there be
[25:10] same one it was standing on earth one
[25:12] day only when he come into the flesh he
[25:14] didn't have to say let there be
[25:16] he said it is
[25:21] we're going to realize that
[25:25] think that's what I believe the Prophet
[25:28] was was talking about in the great
[25:29] things that he would say and he said
[25:31] we're looking for greater things to
[25:33] happen and then he would preach about
[25:38] Moses and speaking the word
[25:41] why Christ speak
[25:45] well that's just to Moses that was just
[25:48] a brother branham
[25:49] it's like the big man he's died and
[25:52] going on that's his business but he said
[25:55] that the third pool was only far brother
[25:59] branham and the Lord Jesus
[26:04] you know I mean that's we see everybody
[26:08] would quote that today well brother
[26:10] so-and-so said well I don't care
[26:14] that don't make it right because brother
[26:17] Dale said it
[26:19] but it makes it right when the Bible
[26:21] says it and the prophets message says it
[26:24] it makes it right to realize who we are
[26:29] we are his wife
[26:32] is that true and who does he who does
[26:36] the wife you know what does the husband
[26:38] put the emphasis on always on to the
[26:41] wife
[26:42] that's what Paul when he got over in
[26:44] their downfall speaking of Christ in the
[26:46] church
[26:48] making it equal and no one didn't
[26:51] realize him to start with that Eve was
[26:54] made co-equal with Adam
[26:57] unless she was made co Huichol with Adam
[27:03] can't you just see this is what kind of
[27:07] funny but somebody was bringing it out
[27:09] and opposite directions that's okay Oh
[27:15] what about it if if Adam was waiting on
[27:19] Eve to speak
[27:24] what's the problem with letting in speak
[27:27] the word I
[27:29] don't see the byproducts either quick
[27:32] thinking quick quick reaction but it's
[27:35] no good
[27:38] we'll see a byproduct of another product
[27:46] when you don't even look up the word
[27:48] by-product even the study nothing out it
[27:51] means of equal value our greater value
[27:54] as a by-product for
[27:58] let's see we don't want something like
[28:00] that because that that makes too much
[28:07] see to me I've just come to the place to
[28:10] preach
[28:12] I'm talking about the past year or so
[28:14] it's just built to the point to actually
[28:17] coming to the basis to preach God's Word
[28:22] no but the devil he's he's there in it
[28:25] that's good
[28:27] but what about it
[28:30] where would be the problem for Adam
[28:32] saying Eve what do you call dad
[28:35] she's the one that's a dog
[28:38] he said well that's good said God what
[28:40] do you think about it he said I think
[28:42] it's a dog you know I miss
[28:48] he's waiting on you and that's what I
[28:50] thought I
[28:52] thought that was the emphasis of the
[28:55] whole message that God is waiting on his
[28:58] bride to
[29:00] what
[29:02] speak the word and go forward with
[29:07] why cry speak only to brother branham
[29:10] or did he preach the message trying to
[29:13] get us we need to quit crying and start
[29:15] speaking
[29:21] then to see that the bride of Jesus
[29:24] Christ
[29:27] will be
[29:31] the Lord himself
[29:34] in human flesh called the son of man the
[29:44] word
[29:48] why can't you think about her being the
[29:51] word
[29:53] why can't we believe what the prophet
[29:56] has said
[29:58] well I just don't know you just see you
[30:03] just you making it you just make it too
[30:05] strong you make it you know yeah you
[30:08] make it like we're something I thought
[30:10] that's what we was
[30:13] [Music]
[30:19] come on I know we do it whatever you go
[30:23] to the wedding you
[30:24] go to a natural wedding
[30:27] hmm and what happens
[30:33] everybody's laughing and talking and
[30:35] won't know and they're getting this
[30:37] ready and they're getting that ready and
[30:39] they're making that ready and this gets
[30:40] ready for that way you know and when he
[30:42] do then here comes the preacher he comes
[30:45] walking out everybody gets a little
[30:46] quiet you know close when he starts out
[30:48] and hour comes to preacher and here
[30:51] comes the best man and here comes to
[30:54] the groom
[30:59] they're finding their places they're
[31:01] getting in place and everything happened
[31:03] all at once
[31:05] something takes place
[31:08] they're laughing and talking oh you got
[31:11] everything ready you got the ring you
[31:13] see that's what we have to do we have to
[31:15] go through all of that make sure
[31:16] everything's in the right place
[31:22] don't natural waiting
[31:24] all at once
[31:27] something happens
[31:31] if you can hear it the first you would
[31:33] hear a click mmm when is that the doors
[31:37] closing
[31:39] the real wedding that's where it's
[31:41] supposed to be now we don't go through
[31:43] all of them
[31:44] close the door
[31:47] nobody is to enter after that click
[31:51] comes to that closing that door I
[31:54] don't care who's outside he's not to
[31:58] enter why because the bride is fixing to
[32:03] step forth
[32:08] the most important party of the entire
[32:15] time of happening
[32:17] he's fixing to step forth all I want to
[32:21] hear
[32:26] everybody rises
[32:32] no more talking no more life and no more
[32:35] going on
[32:37] and then it starts from room to room and
[32:41] you're she comes walking down
[32:45] the most important party of the whole
[32:49] wedding process is now in view and the
[32:53] doors don't open to let in the
[32:56] maybe two or three maids or whatever cuz
[33:00] they're supposed to really go out first
[33:02] you know and do we know the story but
[33:04] get my point nobody enters the building
[33:09] when the bride enters
[33:11] there in
[33:17] nobody moves
[33:20] think about it
[33:24] here stands the groom up the front you
[33:27] know
[33:27] and go he's
[33:30] spellbound
[33:33] he's looking
[33:37] still nobody you know nobody said are
[33:40] you doing alright groom everything's
[33:42] okay we you know nobody don't don't
[33:45] the bride get what I'm talking about
[33:48] then we'll go on with the message
[33:51] if the bride is the most important part
[33:54] of a wedding that why would we be
[33:56] concerned about it now thinking about
[33:57] what thinks about you and me you realize
[34:01] he has put everything he's got
[34:02] everything he could ever make or think
[34:05] of he's put into the ark into us as the
[34:08] Bride of Christ and brought in the lice
[34:10] what I'm getting come on is the life
[34:12] days we get the revelation of all of
[34:16] this
[34:18] in the life stage we get to Revelation
[34:21] see
[34:23] not if the others didn't get a
[34:25] revelation but they didn't understand
[34:29] what
[34:31] Paul was trying to explain Christ in the
[34:34] church and he said I'm talking about a
[34:36] man and his wife and
[34:41] see
[34:43] why can't we think about then that
[34:46] the bride of Jesus Christ is the alive
[34:51] word
[34:57] and the alive word is decent of man
[35:05] the Lord Jesus Christ but he's in bride
[35:08] form
[35:09] then we get to the Book of Revelations
[35:11] and we start off with revelations 1 and
[35:14] he says
[35:16] when in the midst of the seven golden
[35:18] candlesticks like under the son of man
[35:20] Girt about the paps with a golden girdle
[35:24] before he ever starts anything about the
[35:26] ages and what's taking place chapter 1
[35:28] he describes the bride
[35:31] the whole chapter 1 is description to
[35:34] the bride sure it starts off with the
[35:36] groom because the groom is important yes
[35:38] and this
[35:40] but then he starts describing his bride
[35:45] then the church ages is what happens in
[35:47] the time elements of life
[35:51] we said 1-lakh unto the son of man
[35:54] who is that the Prophet said bride for
[36:01] Brod phone
[36:04] then he says it this way he said
[36:07] revelations 1 in revelation 10 1 is the
[36:10] same no no no no PN goes over to them
[36:14] see now you're making the group you're
[36:17] making the best man more important than
[36:21] the groom
[36:22] the lone making it more important than
[36:24] the bride itself
[36:29] see the Word of God the alive word is
[36:35] the son of man that's what I've taught
[36:37] from 1969 to where I am now and I
[36:40] certainly didn't gonna back off from it
[36:42] now and do it and believe in it because
[36:44] that's where I started at that was the
[36:47] first service I've ministered in this
[36:49] message oh
[36:53] yeah about 82 34 some of these others
[36:57] started talking about it and they
[36:58] started with Jordan I didn't make no lot
[37:00] of nobody I've never made no light
[37:02] because of that
[37:03] what you see we were already here in far
[37:07] advanced
[37:08] by the eighties
[37:12] in the son of man and that's been a been
[37:16] an upward thing ever since in for me but
[37:21] can we believe what the Prophet says
[37:28] well
[37:29] you just you're just making it a little
[37:32] bit too much emphasis too much emphasis
[37:33] on what when God put all of his whole
[37:37] emphasis if you ain't listening listen
[37:38] now the whole into our Bible is the
[37:41] emphasis God has put on the bride of
[37:43] Jesus Christ
[37:47] every Buddha this speaks of her
[37:53] she's the most important thing that
[37:55] there is
[37:58] that little bride okay come on What did
[38:02] he say
[38:07] and we know now what's my point I want
[38:10] to emphasize this back over brother
[38:12] branham was not decent man
[38:16] he was a son of man
[38:19] but now listen brother branham as a son
[38:23] of man that's where I've always put my
[38:24] emphasis for people to think on the
[38:27] greatest could be ever thought of you
[38:28] ever thought about this man was a
[38:31] born-again believer
[38:33] until that brother branham now okay
[38:36] because this is where I've always put it
[38:38] and believe it brother Branham was a
[38:40] born-again believer
[38:43] huh he was an adopted manifested son
[38:48] bringing him up to statue of a perfect
[38:50] man etc bringing through the adoptions
[38:53] in the stages and things like that only
[38:56] he was a church age messenger
[39:00] not to lady ousia but the eighth day
[39:05] messenger
[39:09] come on he's not the seventh church age
[39:12] messenger brother brothers not that you
[39:14] you better get in the message he said he
[39:16] said that make me lady Oh see huh
[39:19] huh but look at it he's a born-again
[39:23] believer he's an adopted manifested son
[39:28] he brings forth the
[39:31] word
[39:38] he's not the son of man he's a son of
[39:40] man well greater what greater could you
[39:43] make of him
[39:45] and what's he doing a
[39:50] church age messenger would be a great
[39:52] thing
[39:53] Paul cherry says he said his messenger
[39:56] to the Gentile
[39:58] but think about it a
[40:02] prophet
[40:06] very close to being able to say the
[40:10] Prophet
[40:12] so close to the man's ministry until
[40:15] it's hard to separate and let me say it
[40:18] the way he said it this message and the
[40:22] messenger can't be separated
[40:25] this message and the messenger can't be
[40:30] separated you can separate until you get
[40:34] to the message because the message the
[40:38] you understand brother branham was to be
[40:42] the answer to malachi for luke 1730
[40:47] revelations 10 7 all of those scriptures
[40:50] that were waiting to be fulfilled
[40:56] what greater highs could you make him I
[41:02] always liked about what Paul brings and
[41:05] we just Paul is so straight when he says
[41:08] some and he's talking about that I'm a
[41:10] messenger to the Gentiles he says
[41:12] and he gets through there in a little
[41:15] bit and that while he says I magnify my
[41:17] own office
[41:21] didn't ever thought about what he said
[41:23] yeah
[41:25] he's not just saying he's trying to
[41:28] explain who he is and what he's doing
[41:30] and he said I'm magnified my own office
[41:33] I
[41:35] believe he was the fivefold ministry
[41:37] prophet don't you
[41:41] but I believe these church age messenger
[41:43] made him into the line of being a
[41:44] fivefold ministry prophet now you may
[41:46] differ women are but I said to messenger
[41:48] the messenger to each age I believe
[41:50] would Court would classify as to come
[41:52] into be
[41:53] to that position that he's higher than
[41:57] anybody else the Apostle Paul being the
[42:01] foundation to start with look at it he
[42:03] said and I magnify my own office
[42:06] he said I'm this and I'm that I'm done
[42:09] this is done he's an artist magnify my
[42:11] own office what did he step from a
[42:13] fivefold ministry prophet not into a
[42:16] prophetic realm
[42:19] that would cover all the ages in time
[42:23] that we all have to look back and here
[42:25] comes brother Branham run around and
[42:27] jump up above he had to look back
[42:30] he looked back to that prophet Paul
[42:34] bringing that word
[42:36] you know because he was spoke of in the
[42:39] Word of God to be that the messenger to
[42:41] the Gentiles
[42:42] all right see then he could come forth
[42:46] and find his self written in the word do
[42:49] you understand what I'm getting at you
[42:50] just think what it was for a man to
[42:52] stand here like a brother branham did
[42:54] and one day he would be as Malachi for
[43:02] that he would see itself as Malachi 4 in
[43:05] the scripture
[43:09] how much higher could you make it but
[43:11] look what he says
[43:14] he's revealing himself
[43:20] the Son of man spoke through a prophet
[43:24] to reveal himself to you and I
[43:28] then the prophet speaks right back to
[43:30] the bride to tell her who she is
[43:35] it was a great marvelous thing for Melek
[43:38] afford to be fulfilled but what about
[43:40] the bride of Jesus Christ to be
[43:41] fulfilled to realize who she is
[43:44] and that all the Bible speaks of her
[43:47] points at her
[43:50] and all of it is her come on
[43:57] let's just read a couple oh yeah I
[44:01] know I'm not gonna get to the end of
[44:03] this but I'll try to get part of it but
[44:05] I'm trying my best to get you this is
[44:07] this this morning has been just a price
[44:10] run-through of what I've been doing for
[44:12] 50 years
[44:15] I'm preaching
[44:18] 40-something years bump in
[44:21] 52 preach
[44:24] to get people to see who they are
[44:28] well
[44:32] brother told me one time he said he
[44:34] preached a message here and I didn't get
[44:36] it I mean I'm honest I didn't get our
[44:38] wasn't worldly talking about he's he
[44:41] kept preaching don't feed my sheep feed
[44:43] my sheep
[44:45] you know I knew him see and I knew he
[44:49] was beating at me I mean he ain't got no
[44:52] problem I knew what he was talking about
[44:54] but what was he talking about you know
[44:56] what was he trying to say
[44:59] then one day I kind of run around
[45:02] talking with him brought it into that
[45:04] realm he said I was trying my best to
[45:06] tell you to feed my children and get
[45:08] away from preaching on them shields and
[45:10] things that
[45:14] was the one that surprised me
[45:20] to think that somebody would think
[45:22] preaching the seals was something you
[45:24] don't need to preach you know or
[45:26] something you need to preach salvation
[45:28] but you know what I guess was up to it
[45:31] and walked away you know because of what
[45:35] he would come to this church of a
[45:37] morning service go home at my house and
[45:40] eat dinner with us get up and go home
[45:42] and never come back to the evening
[45:43] service
[45:45] he was wrong all over the country with
[45:47] his family see I wanted to say it but
[45:50] Ivan people thinks I'm so hard and so
[45:52] that it see I had an illegal right to
[45:55] say to him take your problem with your
[45:57] children's is you you taken him all over
[45:59] the country
[46:01] you're the one that's taking them out
[46:03] and doing it you need to be preaching to
[46:04] them
[46:07] living it before them I wanted to say
[46:10] that but on
[46:13] country too popular penny and I'm a
[46:15] better guy in there
[46:18] but you understand what I'm getting out
[46:22] he was preaching a couple of messages
[46:24] feed my sheep
[46:27] meaning I was preaching too deep for his
[46:31] family how can you preach too deep I
[46:33] won't know what deep is
[46:35] look the more I see this message of
[46:38] shallow way against whether you like
[46:41] that statement or not then you then you
[46:43] if you don't believe it you don't know
[46:45] what it's about it's the best way for me
[46:46] to say it the more the more you preach
[46:49] it the more simple that becomes I
[46:55] can see now how that Old Testament comes
[46:58] down and bring down that man God himself
[47:02] till he comes into human flesh and there
[47:04] it was the Son of man standing on earth
[47:07] and had to die in that position but
[47:10] before he died he created his bride
[47:13] because he spoke her into existence
[47:21] he planted the seed in other words the
[47:24] Bible says
[47:25] the Son of Man is the sower of the seed
[47:28] if there's any seed planted fields plant
[47:31] I mean the things you know imagined
[47:34] aboard any missions gotta come through
[47:36] there
[47:38] through that store of the seed
[47:43] here the rock I said I want to go here
[47:45] comes a prophet standing up there he
[47:47] doesn't get up there in the first field
[47:49] he said this is the staff and Lord now I
[47:51] want y'all listen no he starts preaching
[47:55] and he preaches
[47:58] he just keeps moving up moving up moving
[48:03] up and I thought he's gonna preach on
[48:05] the see you I
[48:07] admit it
[48:12] you never noticed you're going to see a
[48:14] book that starts off with
[48:16] God in simplicity
[48:20] and then it goes to the breach
[48:24] and to messages he had to preach before
[48:27] he could preach the seals
[48:30] you know why because he didn't know what
[48:32] they were cuz that's what he said he
[48:34] said Lord met me today or I'd have made
[48:36] a horrible mistake on seal number one
[48:39] you know what he was to do it he was
[48:41] preaching
[48:41] you know what he was doing he's taking
[48:44] all the Bible just what I don't want to
[48:46] go to go back to the son of man he was
[48:48] going back through that Bible and
[48:51] making sure that he had everything lined
[48:54] up to that word and then he comes to
[48:56] that breach and he could see hey wait a
[48:58] minute this thing got something to do
[49:00] with me now I realized that but I can't
[49:03] blast it out before I have to wait he
[49:06] doesn't come out on seal number one and
[49:08] say I'm gonna give you the staff the
[49:09] Lord he preaches it
[49:12] two three if you'll notice he gets on
[49:15] over about the third seal I believe one
[49:17] right now you can check it for danger
[49:18] you know I'm just making a point with it
[49:20] then he gets over into therefore he says
[49:22] this is the staff the Lord
[49:26] because like I said while ago people
[49:28] wouldn't believe in what he was doing
[49:29] but when he clicked him with us that the
[49:32] Lord is they'd so used to that till they
[49:34] clicked back hey wait a minute listen
[49:39] and he starts bringing that out and he's
[49:42] and then we can see the son of man
[49:44] the Lord Jesus Christ coming on the
[49:46] scene
[49:47] through the revealed word
[49:52] then he comes over to seal number one
[49:55] and he stands there this is about 156 or
[49:58] something steelbook and he stands there
[50:01] and he says
[50:03] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[50:05] hand
[50:06] then out are goes the white horse rider
[50:09] looking like he was talking literally of
[50:11] his own self in that sense he was but he
[50:14] said here stands a lie him but he was
[50:15] talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and
[50:18] said out there goes a
[50:21] white horse rider he says that I cannot
[50:24] be
[50:25] that cannot be the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:28] that we thought
[50:29] because here stands the Lord Jesus
[50:32] Christ with the lamb in the book in his
[50:33] ass and said after going he was making
[50:35] it so personal under when he said in a
[50:37] minute he said I'd done it he's talking
[50:39] about to open into the seals in and I
[50:41] remember the brother preaching it and
[50:44] saying to me one day said you think that
[50:47] might have been brother branham
[50:48] you know when he said
[50:51] it he he could he was preaching it like
[50:55] so much of his own self I said no
[50:58] brother that wasn't that
[51:00] wasn't brother Branham he wasn't when he
[51:03] said I done it
[51:05] it wasn't him
[51:08] he put the emphasis in the right place
[51:10] come on listen but think about it let's
[51:13] just read a few
[51:14] cuz I want you to keep this part about
[51:17] the son of man
[51:19] because to me the son of man
[51:22] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[51:25] all of these things that I've been
[51:27] preaching on lately getting up to work
[51:29] wanna preach on the wave sheath and time
[51:31] all of that is about the bride in her
[51:35] word
[51:37] and her message is
[51:41] but it's so simple going to number one
[51:48] take him to the message of trial in
[51:51] these last days a son of man making
[51:54] himself known among his people in the
[51:56] form of his people
[52:01] not son of God that was down to the
[52:04] church ages as a son of God because see
[52:07] when he died at Calvary he released that
[52:09] life that was in him which was the holy
[52:11] spirit there's your son of God through
[52:13] the seven churches was that holy spirit
[52:15] but that Holy Spirit is put out you say
[52:19] run around and said it was you say what
[52:21] no no no no then people out there
[52:23] walking they don't walk the Holy Spirit
[52:25] they don't want the word the Spirit
[52:27] being one oh
[52:29] they want to shout they want the glory
[52:32] they want to healings and signs and the
[52:34] wonders they don't want the word they
[52:37] put the word out
[52:39] then he can come forth when he did it
[52:42] can come forth a son of man listen they
[52:46] not son of God my son of David was son
[52:49] of man
[52:50] look at him the son of God was the
[52:52] supernatural they put the supernatural
[52:56] out claiming to believe it
[52:59] no wonder they didn't want brother ran
[53:01] him around he's telling them to go to
[53:05] the message and study where he talks
[53:07] about Azusa Street and how that they put
[53:09] God out of the church and he's on the
[53:11] outside knocking to get back in that
[53:13] ain't the son of man
[53:16] son of man I ain't trying to not to get
[53:19] back in the church called he the son of
[53:21] man was never put out of the church he's
[53:23] got to come forth in a manifestation to
[53:25] be put out the Holy Ghost came forth in
[53:27] a manifestation
[53:29] and they put him out of the church
[53:35] no no no they won't even if you're er
[53:39] they wanted for healing and signs and
[53:42] wonders they don't want the word
[53:46] wise the people this message hate it so
[53:49] much why
[53:53] are they trying so much now to destroy
[53:56] the very message that they claim to be
[53:57] right and I ain't talking about all of
[54:00] them to put it out I'm talking about the
[54:02] ones that does it under current
[54:06] you know
[54:10] what about it Church
[54:14] the last days in the forum are in
[54:18] Moorthy

[54:25] people in the form of his people so you
[54:29] can preach spread around on that son of
[54:31] man he's priests brother branham there's
[54:33] no sign and everybody's so tickled to
[54:35] death
[54:37] but no
[54:38] he's talking about the people
[54:45] didn't say when the Prophet realized who
[54:47] he was gonna do know he had already
[54:49] realized who he was when the bride

[55:48] Lord seven Thunder virtuous perusing all
[55:51] that I was the one that it's like that
[55:54] was in The ministers meeting one day and
[55:55] they were having it about some and then
[55:57] they said come on brother Dale I said
[55:58] well I got a speak

[56:07] but I want to keep my mouth shut cause I
[56:10] like people

[56:15] people ain't gonna like me
[56:19] I've always tried to do everything I
[56:22] could to try to help the people of this
[56:23] message yeah
[56:28] let's see you go on dinner yeah okay now

[56:43] Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is
[56:49] in you tonight
[56:51] it's still God manifests himself in the
[56:55] last days now what a wonderful statement
[57:02] if Jesus was God in flesh
[57:06] we know that
[57:10] he come down in sin he work out he come
[57:13] down when in him that's the same way for
[57:16] you and I and if Jesus is in you tonight
[57:19] it's still God manifest himself in the
[57:22] last day the Son of Man revealing
[57:24] himself in his church
[57:31] the human flesh making himself known you
[57:34] get it God down here in his church
[57:36] making itself again the word the son of
[57:39] man being revealed in the last days as
[57:43] it was in the days of Sodom

[57:57] destroyed brother Branham or

[58:12] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[58:14] of the world they come down through the
[58:16] apostles inside are excess and then the
[58:18] Holy Spirit wasn't only in one person
[58:22] it's in the entire Church Universal
[58:26] doing the same works that Jesus did
[58:29] hallelu you know what what he said I
[58:31] challenge the world to believe that and
[58:35] you'll see a revival breakthrough in
[58:37] this country I say it to the church in
[58:41] Lula if you want to see a revival a
[58:46] lot of who you are and what's taking
[58:50] place
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:52] you don't have to worry about it it'll
[58:56] take care of itself okay
[58:59] number five
[59:03] and then there would come a time from
[59:05] across the mystery God revealed on 4th
[59:07] when he could express himself in
[59:09] fullness of his Godhead the deity
[59:12] through the end time prophet now that
[59:15] any what it says but that's what you
[59:17] reading
[59:18] because you'll read it for that and amen
[59:21] but you won't read it when it says
[59:22] through his church having the
[59:24] preeminence in his church oh my what the
[59:27] anointed man now the anointed people oh
[59:30] my to bring back the anointed bride and
[59:34] the bridegroom
[59:37] anointed by why excepting one Eve
[59:40] turndown and Adam coming back with the
[59:43] anointing of the world God he said my
[59:45] word is spirit the anointing with the
[59:47] word what Eve turned down he comes back
[59:50] and we accept
[59:55] the pride
[59:57] the bride
[1:00:00] anointed with the word
[1:00:03] okay go ahead to the next one the
[1:00:06] unveiling God
[1:00:08] notice now he came first as the prophet
[1:00:11] okay now there's the Old Testament one
[1:00:14] becomes the profit and they crucified
[1:00:15] him his own crucified him he came as the
[1:00:19] son of man okay they crucified the Son
[1:00:22] of man they did not crucify the Son of
[1:00:25] God on Calvary because the Son of God is
[1:00:27] spirit God and he couldn't die in that
[1:00:29] way so he had to take and that anointing
[1:00:32] that came on him that we've all tried to
[1:00:34] preach in the northern came on him on
[1:00:37] the river Jordan it had to leave him in
[1:00:40] the Garden of Gethsemane the Prophet
[1:00:42] said where he could die as a man they
[1:00:44] couldn't kill him with that anointing on
[1:00:46] him
[1:00:47] now listen here's one thing I've always
[1:00:49] tried to say so listen they couldn't
[1:00:52] kill him with that anointing on him
[1:00:55] it had to leave before he could die you
[1:00:58] can't die with the anointing that's on
[1:01:01] you now if you'll believe it and accept
[1:01:04] it you can't die
[1:01:07] cuz see we're not gonna do like it goes
[1:01:10] off of us and let's go by the grave
[1:01:11] we're going in a rapture
[1:01:14] so the anointing not gonna leave us
[1:01:16] the anointing gonna take us out of here
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:25] come on
[1:01:27] and after the Holy Spirit came he was
[1:01:29] then the son of God God is a spirit he
[1:01:32] was His Holy Spirit son of God he lived
[1:01:34] through the church ages as son of God
[1:01:37] then the Millennium he'll be son of
[1:01:39] David sitting upon the throne of his
[1:01:40] father David he is the son of David now
[1:01:43] you remember I remember I've always said
[1:01:45] this when I read that I always said it
[1:01:47] when we believe it see he's son of that
[1:01:50] he he's son of God son of man son of
[1:01:52] David Rose of Sharon living a valley
[1:01:54] bright morning star Alpha Omega he's all
[1:01:57] those things to us already because we're
[1:01:59] talking about by revelation but
[1:02:02] physically he hasn't come to them since
[1:02:04] those places he hasn't come - son of
[1:02:07] David yet but we can call him son of
[1:02:09] David come we know who he is and
[1:02:15] then if nothing else happens we can say
[1:02:17] and well let me get the crumbs they
[1:02:20] falls from the table at least a little
[1:02:23] bit give me that and the Millennium he
[1:02:25] be son of David sitting on throwing his
[1:02:27] father David he is the son of David now
[1:02:29] and remember between the Son of God in
[1:02:32] the lady of C an age they put him out
[1:02:35] and in Luke he said he would be revealed
[1:02:38] again a son of man the Prophet
[1:02:40] fulfilling the rest of it and the
[1:02:42] Scriptures type perfectly together son
[1:02:44] of man son of God son of David what was
[1:02:46] it it's the same God all the time just
[1:02:48] changing his form he morphe he just
[1:02:51] changed it it's a great drama to him he
[1:02:55] is acting it out what about at church do
[1:02:59] you see what I'm talking about through
[1:03:01] the church ages he would be son of God
[1:03:03] but in all that wants just something
[1:03:06] happens right at the end of the seventh
[1:03:08] church age something takes place and
[1:03:10] when it does the ours were Malachi 4
[1:03:12] comes in
[1:03:16] Malachi 4 comes in at that point Luke 17
[1:03:19] 30
[1:03:21] just as it did back
[1:03:24] just as the Old Testament was ending
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:29] and you come in with Elijah John the
[1:03:32] Baptist then the Lord Jesus came well
[1:03:36] that's what we're supposed to do now
[1:03:37] brother Branham was to come in the last
[1:03:40] days return the hearts of the Father and
[1:03:42] the Lord Jesus is to come on this thing
[1:03:47] or
[1:03:49] in his pride
[1:03:53] because it's not a form there to put it
[1:03:56] anywhere else if you're listening
[1:04:01] see you gotta go son of man
[1:04:05] son of God son of man made way for the
[1:04:09] Son of God to come into be
[1:04:11] son of God in the church ages makes way
[1:04:14] for the son of David to come into be
[1:04:16] which you can't go from son of God I've
[1:04:18] tried to explain this and people just
[1:04:20] look at you you can't go from son of day
[1:04:23] a son of God in the church ages to son
[1:04:27] of David that's too far of a jump you
[1:04:30] can't do it you got to come back to the
[1:04:31] son of man let that son of man come in
[1:04:35] for just a little bit then we can go to
[1:04:37] the Millennium and he can be the son of
[1:04:39] David
[1:04:40] but he'll work on the beers hug his wife
[1:04:43] in the Millennium we ain't gonna be
[1:04:45] worried about worthy son God son of
[1:04:47] David he's gonna be our sweetheart we're
[1:04:50] gonna have pet names if you want to get
[1:04:53] with it we'll talk about it you say well
[1:04:55] what about the new name well what is the
[1:04:57] new name
[1:04:59] ain't got rid of Jesus yet I'm still
[1:05:03] believing in that but they did there's
[1:05:06] going to be a sweetheart named
[1:05:09] right it won't be Redemption it won't be
[1:05:12] nothing like that if you want a new name
[1:05:15] make it to be something that sweetheart
[1:05:16] you know
[1:05:19] well you call her boy babe I
[1:05:27] hear you say babe I don't think he's
[1:05:30] talking about my wife
[1:05:35] I know who he's talking about but are
[1:05:38] you getting it I
[1:05:40] hate to keep repeating
[1:05:42] but through the church ages all right
[1:05:45] let's go to number seven this depicts
[1:05:48] have another movement try to catch up
[1:05:51] who is this son of man
[1:05:55] what he's asking the question
[1:06:00] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:06:03] Word was with God and the Word was
[1:06:05] caught in the Word was made flesh and
[1:06:06] dwelt among us can I say it like this
[1:06:08] who is this son of man the Creator God
[1:06:12] who
[1:06:13] creates all things and without him
[1:06:17] there's not anything made of corn or the
[1:06:19] Bible said that was made unless he
[1:06:22] creates it
[1:06:24] in every bit of it everything is always
[1:06:27] a new creation
[1:06:30] everything begins for the new creation
[1:06:32] has got - okay look the Book of Luke
[1:06:35] here as we just quoted and Luke the 17th
[1:06:38] chapter in the 30th verse Malachi for
[1:06:40] the different scriptures that we are
[1:06:42] acquainted with that word again is waved
[1:06:45] over the people that the dead traditions
[1:06:48] of man is dead and the Son of God is
[1:06:51] alive again with baptism of the holy
[1:06:54] spirit right among us and he's giving us
[1:06:57] life
[1:07:00] among us
[1:07:02] the bride
[1:07:04] what about it
[1:07:09] what about it I
[1:07:11] don't want to go too far because
[1:07:14] you know you get into different
[1:07:16] situations
[1:07:17] but I want to say something to you just
[1:07:22] to ask you a question
[1:07:24] do you believe it's possible
[1:07:28] after all we've studied to the Bible and
[1:07:30] the message and thing
[1:07:32] is it possible for us to realize who we
[1:07:38] are
[1:07:42] and to realize that
[1:07:47] he has done ever better this himself
[1:07:54] and made manifest about a group of
[1:07:57] people that can believe him
[1:08:03] well why not he's talking about us when
[1:08:07] we're gonna realize that he's talking
[1:08:09] about I said she all makes the whole
[1:08:10] whole thing a whole lot easier to talk
[1:08:12] about if you realize he's talking about
[1:08:14] you brother Ryan
[1:08:16] no I
[1:08:18] mean should that be the most wonderful
[1:08:21] thing to think about that we've come all
[1:08:22] of these years to come to find out but
[1:08:25] God all these years he's been trying to
[1:08:26] talk to us about this to get us to see
[1:08:28] who we are I
[1:08:31] mean I've been around 50 years some of
[1:08:34] you 20 30 40 whatever you know your -
[1:08:37] whatever
[1:08:40] about it
[1:08:43] even the whole thing has been pointing
[1:08:45] to the bride of Jesus cry
[1:08:51] see how much God values and honors its
[1:08:55] wife
[1:08:58] that's why it says overdone revelation
[1:09:00] you know he said and his wife has made
[1:09:03] herself ready didn't say bride in that
[1:09:05] situation now come on he doesn't leave
[1:09:07] it out cause you turn over about two or
[1:09:09] three more chapters you tell them it's a
[1:09:10] bride so don't just understand it
[1:09:11] understand what's being say it a wife is
[1:09:14] a greater point of understanding than a
[1:09:16] to say a bride a bride is the little
[1:09:19] girl walking down the are know the
[1:09:21] aisles and you know the that situation
[1:09:26] whereas a a wife is a seasoned
[1:09:30] lady I
[1:09:33] say it was respect of all things she
[1:09:37] seasoned because she understands
[1:09:42] that's a real wife
[1:09:45] he knows the different things right all
[1:09:48] right now listen let me let me get this
[1:09:51] but is it possible to you to think about
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:58] without the bride
[1:10:02] the fullness of the Godhead is
[1:10:04] incomplete
[1:10:11] you remember that how many services and
[1:10:13] we went over and over and over
[1:10:18] the message leaning hundred I don't
[1:10:21] understand him God isn't complete
[1:10:24] without you
[1:10:26] you realize if you're talking about the
[1:10:28] fullness of the Godhead bodily you've
[1:10:30] got to be talking about the bride
[1:10:33] because without her in her correct
[1:10:35] position
[1:10:38] the fullness is not here
[1:10:42] yeah but that's making to it no it's not
[1:10:44] making enough
[1:10:46] we ever get around to preaching on
[1:10:48] predestination we'll go back before the
[1:10:51] foundation of the world and start back
[1:10:53] dire and see what the word really is
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:10:58] the word was dire the word was that
[1:11:01] creator that cut step forth and said let
[1:11:04] there be
[1:11:08] No
[1:11:09] what about it
[1:11:12] what about it Church
[1:11:16] let's just read a few of these right
[1:11:18] here and then I'll quit on it I'll drop
[1:11:20] off the I want you to get on the wave
[1:11:22] sheaf and stuff like that and we'll be
[1:11:24] on that neck so you know do it let's go
[1:11:27] to number eight and we're gonna try to
[1:11:28] read fast and run okay
[1:11:40] but all of God
[1:11:41] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:11:43] bodily
[1:11:44] all of God was poured into Christ all
[1:11:48] that God was in Christ and all that
[1:11:51] Christ he is is poured out on the church
[1:11:54] I
[1:11:58] just can't see how that wait a minute I
[1:12:02] wonder is that one he said Dan but you
[1:12:05] keep refusing it
[1:12:09] you keep refusing who you are
[1:12:16] well I just I just don't ya see what you
[1:12:19] need is the new birth
[1:12:20] kind of say it that way without hurting
[1:12:22] feelings what you need is the new birth
[1:12:25] you know what I've had to do it well now
[1:12:27] you need more feelings
[1:12:29] you need more growth in the stature of
[1:12:32] perfect land
[1:12:34] right but look what he says but you keep
[1:12:38] refusing go to the net that was off the
[1:12:40] message at Good Shepherd this is off the
[1:12:43] paddlers vision
[1:12:45] God being revealed in Christ how many
[1:12:47] believes it God was revealed in Christ
[1:12:49] Joel were revealed in Christ now where's
[1:12:52] God to be revealed
[1:12:55] in his church
[1:12:59] with his people in us the same spirit
[1:13:03] the same works the same on manifestation
[1:13:06] the same love the same forgiveness the
[1:13:09] same long-suffering gentleness patience
[1:13:12] peace mercy all that was in crisis in
[1:13:15] the church remember keep that in mind
[1:13:17] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:13:22] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:13:24] bodily and all that Christ was he poured
[1:13:28] into the church
[1:13:30] what would that be God above us God with
[1:13:34] us God in us died try unity of God God
[1:13:39] manifested in three different manners
[1:13:41] father son long ago
[1:13:45] take
[1:13:47] take the distal little call fullness of
[1:13:50] the Godhead bodily spell it two
[1:13:51] different ways now when you when you
[1:13:53] type it in spell it he was the full ful
[1:13:56] in ESS go with that then back up and go
[1:14:00] with he was the fu ll in the SS and you
[1:14:04] pick up a whole lot more and read how
[1:14:07] many times brother Branham uses that
[1:14:10] statement and it ever time that he uses
[1:14:12] it he finalizes with what all God was he
[1:14:15] poured into Christ all Christ is poured
[1:14:17] into the church take us back to the
[1:14:19] Garden of Eden Christ the mystery of God
[1:14:21] revealed
[1:14:22] and read how many times he says that but
[1:14:26] we know now here's the reason we can go
[1:14:30] ahead to the next
[1:14:34] because this is our problem God's only
[1:14:37] provided place of worship no leaven
[1:14:39] among you
[1:14:41] that brings the entire fullness out of
[1:14:45] Godhead bodily among you
[1:14:51] what's 11
[1:14:57] let's let him say it couldn't do it
[1:15:01] Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's
[1:15:03] age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age
[1:15:05] but in the day when the Son of Man will
[1:15:08] be
[1:15:09] manifested revealed brought back the
[1:15:11] church together with the entire deity of
[1:15:14] God amongst his people showing the same
[1:15:18] visible signs manifesting himself like
[1:15:21] he did at the beginning when he was
[1:15:23] manifested on earth in the form of a
[1:15:25] prophet now what was it
[1:15:29] he couldn't do it in Wesley's age why
[1:15:33] absence of word absence of people to
[1:15:36] realize who they are can I stay at that
[1:15:38] away
[1:15:39] couldn't do it Wesley absence of people
[1:15:42] who could not take the word for what it
[1:15:44] was they come up with a Trinitarian con
[1:15:46] fail
[1:15:47] Pentecostals come up with a corner with
[1:15:49] the Trinity and signs and and things
[1:15:52] like that you know speaking in tongues
[1:15:54] etc etc they couldn't stand the revealed
[1:15:56] word
[1:15:58] so they put it out
[1:16:03] though when the word goes out of a
[1:16:05] church the Holy Spirit automatically
[1:16:06] goes
[1:16:08] cuz that's what it is working spirit of
[1:16:10] one
[1:16:11] no livin what is living
[1:16:14] denominationalism your ideas and my
[1:16:17] ideas contrary to God's Word
[1:16:20] is living and we've had them until these
[1:16:24] virtues come in us we are subject to all
[1:16:28] of the faults and failures of life and
[1:16:31] understanding and denominationalism
[1:16:33] xingtai well I've been out of the
[1:16:35] nomination that's what I said when I
[1:16:36] left the Baptist Church just ended up
[1:16:39] from a church or in games when I said
[1:16:41] somebody said something and I said well
[1:16:42] I
[1:16:44] got out of the Baptist now I want the
[1:16:48] Baptist out of me
[1:16:51] you said well I left the denomination
[1:16:53] will have their denomination left you I
[1:16:56] mean that's as serious as I can be
[1:16:59] because see I preach like that things
[1:17:01] that you don't believe in gifts and
[1:17:02] signs and wonders you don't you don't
[1:17:04] talk like that to this land
[1:17:07] when I have told you many many
[1:17:10] manifestations of God in what has
[1:17:12] happened even to be able to smell the
[1:17:15] presence of Almighty God
[1:17:18] what I said you don't do it when you say
[1:17:20] well we don't have these signs and
[1:17:22] wonders why
[1:17:29] we've seen the dead raise the sick heal
[1:17:31] we've seen strong spoke into existence
[1:17:33] we've seen rain come rain leave we've
[1:17:36] seen everything could be thought of in
[1:17:37] every room that could be thought of in
[1:17:39] this little church
[1:17:43] when I ain't don't see it well why don't
[1:17:46] you go somewheres else where you can see
[1:17:49] I'm not sarcastic and their hateful with
[1:17:52] that I'm just saying if you're sitting
[1:17:55] here well I don't see it well go
[1:17:56] somewhere else where you can find it
[1:17:58] because we got to get out of here
[1:18:05] when wife was asking me yesterday she
[1:18:07] said how long do you think this thing
[1:18:09] can go I said I don't know I said I know
[1:18:11] this much
[1:18:14] if things don't happen pretty quick the
[1:18:16] economy's gone
[1:18:17] you say what you want to they're doing
[1:18:19] this they're doing that I'll get back to
[1:18:21] that sort of what I told her it's gone
[1:18:24] but then they turn around and open this
[1:18:26] thing back up
[1:18:28] and all at once you get a double portion
[1:18:31] of that demon of death coming upon the
[1:18:33] people you're gonna be blaming the
[1:18:35] president for it you're gonna be doing a
[1:18:36] whole kind of thing and you're gonna be
[1:18:38] down
[1:18:40] one of them two is going to take place
[1:18:42] pretty quickly
[1:18:45] how quick I don't know ain't nothing
[1:18:49] but I know one thing for sure
[1:18:54] only those who are anchored in the word
[1:18:58] will be able to stand the trials and the
[1:19:01] tests this fights coming in on us and
[1:19:04] you think I'm gonna just quit on that
[1:19:06] part and you think oh
[1:19:10] it can't come on us
[1:19:13] you said that six months ago a
[1:19:17] lot of you did this can't happen that
[1:19:19] came out but we're bride six months ago
[1:19:22] you said that
[1:19:24] I'm even making no dates and I'm just
[1:19:27] saying it I'm just saying related to
[1:19:29] what you seeing who thought six months
[1:19:32] ago that they could just shut down
[1:19:35] schools they take a shutdown
[1:19:38] cafes they take a shut down businesses
[1:19:41] General Motors close
[1:19:44] has to be set down because of somebody
[1:19:47] with one disease
[1:19:51] see now the Buffalo point of behind is
[1:19:56] got out of the kind of the way and now
[1:19:58] your news media is dealing with what
[1:20:00] were to dis start and they're already
[1:20:04] declaring now that they know it started
[1:20:06] in China and they're already demanding
[1:20:09] China to make payments
[1:20:17] what if this was a man-made thing let me
[1:20:21] say it this way I don't care what you
[1:20:23] think it was it was a man-made thing
[1:20:25] something went wrong
[1:20:27] diseases and things comes and stuff
[1:20:30] going wrong not necessarily somebody
[1:20:32] planning for it to be that way if
[1:20:34] something goes wrong
[1:20:38] you think we're not in the end time
[1:20:43] all they got to do is say no
[1:20:47] more traveling what if they come out now
[1:20:51] what if what if things started turning
[1:20:54] around a little bit and all that once
[1:20:55] they spent we later dive downward what
[1:20:57] are they gonna do you won't be able to
[1:21:00] travel you won't be able to go nowhere
[1:21:01] you won't be able to go to church you
[1:21:03] won't be able to go to work you won't be
[1:21:05] able to do nothing they don't know they
[1:21:06] can close all that down what are you
[1:21:09] gonna do
[1:21:14] the I'd be I'd be so scared to death so
[1:21:18] I could understand it if I didn't know
[1:21:20] what the Prophet is talk I
[1:21:24] would I'd literally be I probably they
[1:21:28] said they're jumping out of the
[1:21:29] buildings and everything else you know
[1:21:30] there's no depression my lord i guy I
[1:21:33] blow the building up with me in here why
[1:21:37] because listen there's nothing you can
[1:21:39] do
[1:21:42] there's nothing they can do they son
[1:21:46] said it it's done
[1:21:48] they can face all the laws that won't
[1:21:50] too thing bar all the money they want to
[1:21:52] but who's gonna pay it back
[1:21:57] if everything went smooth and the
[1:22:00] disease died today and no more - you
[1:22:03] realize how long it take to get this
[1:22:04] economy back going and rolling
[1:22:08] and you realize all the money it would
[1:22:10] take to do it with and you realize where
[1:22:13] you gonna get that money from
[1:22:17] and you realize that according to now
[1:22:20] I'm talking about loaning like you think
[1:22:22] loaning I'm talking about world
[1:22:24] governments etc and and all of that you
[1:22:28] realize that China is one of our biggest
[1:22:30] lender
[1:22:32] now through the money market of the
[1:22:35] world I'm talking about we borrowed
[1:22:36] money from China
[1:22:40] you realize how close we are to what
[1:22:42] could happen
[1:22:52] but can you say
[1:22:54] come on
[1:22:57] Lord and get us out of here
[1:23:01] help us to realize who we are and what
[1:23:03] we're doing here help us to get out of
[1:23:06] here
[1:23:07] get away from this plane
[1:23:10] they will serve Him and be what he wants
[1:23:14] to but it's still no matter what happens
[1:23:16] or takes place we still glory in our God
[1:23:19] and Savior and then knowing that he is
[1:23:21] the only one that can carry us through
[1:23:23] anything
[1:23:28] let's tan what about musicians come on I
[1:23:34] really meant to try to get on in to the
[1:23:36] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:23:38] God brother Branham talks about that to
[1:23:40] the bride so I wrote these down in my
[1:23:42] Bible in 1969 and read them I
[1:23:50] have a whole lot more than I had then to
[1:23:53] put my basis on I
[1:23:57] realized when that bride realized who
[1:23:59] she is and what she here for
[1:24:03] she's gonna be an investable army why
[1:24:06] cause it's not afraid
[1:24:10] not afraid
[1:24:13] no what are you gonna do if they come in
[1:24:16] close the doors
[1:24:18] we'll figure out some other way
[1:24:22] we'll take care of it we'll do the best
[1:24:24] we can
[1:24:29] little bride has not been forsaken
[1:24:35] he's being tried
[1:24:37] to see what she'll do
[1:24:42] we can't go out what is the scripture
[1:24:45] for you knew with the footmen what about
[1:24:47] when the horseman gets here you know and
[1:24:50] if you can't dwell in the what is the
[1:24:51] swelling of the Jordan and all I had the
[1:24:54] scriptures
[1:24:56] if you can't keep up with a footman if
[1:24:58] you can't abide with things little
[1:25:00] things happening and going on what about
[1:25:03] one that really fired I am
[1:25:07] until you 19 and 74 they passed a law in
[1:25:11] Georgia you could not travel over 25
[1:25:14] miles to church
[1:25:16] that pretty well ends just about all of
[1:25:19] this church
[1:25:26] what we're gonna do
[1:25:31] but the thing about it is he took care
[1:25:33] of us so far go ahead pass
