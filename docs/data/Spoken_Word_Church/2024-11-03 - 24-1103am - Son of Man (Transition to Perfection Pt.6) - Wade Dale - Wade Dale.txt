we're coming back here to live amen there's a few of the the couple questions this afternoon this afternoon to be questions and answers um I'm going to say it's not going to be long but it is one of the questions is what is the difference in like paradise um heaven and and all that so we're going to answer that and one question that says please in 20 minutes or less explain Daniel 70 weeks so uh with the help of the Lord cuz he's going to have to do it I can't but I think I've got it condensed down where we can talk about it and get the Gest of it because what's going to happen is now later when we get we're into now uh we're going to read in Malachi 4 about the Prophet Elijah coming we're living in that day listen we're not people say we're living in Bible times hold on a minute you didn't come in here in a horse carriage and you didn't go home to a cave or a thatched house no you're living the Bible time you're living what it said and I know some of us bad rich increas with Goods have need of nothing and all that stuff but still we are living what the Bible's always been looking for is this group of people right here do you know one thing for sure you are one of the five wise virgins who's it talking about they went to Rapture they that us so there were identified right there in the Bible just in one little scripture we'll read some more maybe a little bit later so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day you've give us thank you for this time Lord that we have we pray that you would be with the ones that are not here that are sick Lord just bless the ones that are sin sick father and bring them into fold be with the ones Lord that are traveling Lord in different ones father we pray that you'd just bless us now anoint the word through the people's ears in Jesus name amen we're still on transition to Perfection all right we're on part six and I think we got this thing working man said one time a man named Toby Mack everybody know who Toby Mack is most of you that listen to contemporary Christian music he said practice the pause when in doubt pause when you're angry pause when you're tired pause when you're stressed pause and when you pause pray good thing to do not just jump in right pause and then pray so let's read Malachi 4 very familiar but we're going to break it down a little bit today for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud ye all that do wickedly shall be stubbled and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor Branch now this is the last prophet to the Old Testament there's 400 years between him and Jesus or John the Baptist all right there's going to be 400 years but this is what the Jewish people even of this day right here are looking for Elijah because that's what this says right here not knowing that they missed the Messiah they missed this Elijah but when that Elijah that the spirit of come from here that goes over the into the for the Jews for the 144,000 he's going to take this message and they're going to see that Elijah anointing all right and they're going to accept him but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings so there had to be a healing campaign to start this out and you shall go forth and grow up grow up you shall mature under this ministry as calvs of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayth the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in for all Israel with the statutes and judgments because remember this is Malachi coming out of the Old Testament into the new they don't know anything about a messiah they know he's coming they've got a few characteristics but they thought he was just going to come and take over they were going to kill all he was going to kill all the Romans and they were going to set up a kingdom right cuz that's what they kept asking him are you going to set up the kingdom now it was a wrong Kingdom right so behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so see it the Jews are reading this because they read the Old Testament they don't do they don't read the New Testament but they read the Old Testament the Torah so they're reading this they're looking for Elijah before the great and dead Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now we know who was that that was John the Baptist everybody with me father's Old Testament fathers New Testament young people brand new ministry brand new message right Christians and the Heart of the children to the fathers brother brandom or Elijah number four lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated so they are looking for an Elijah to come on the scene before God curses this Earth all right but we know one thing for sure he's here brought his message and left all right and now Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery remember that's not plural the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so this man the seventh angel messenger has to be on the earth at this time and he has to be a prophet all right not only a church aged messenger but a prophet there were many Church aged Messengers that were not prophets identified in the word like brother brandom everybody with me so now let's go to Zechariah 4:5 we'll try to get finished here by 12 and then we'll have our our time back again but that um make sure everybody changed their clocks I didn't see everybody got here so let's good the angel that Tau with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord These Old Testament people they didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't have the baptism of Holy Ghost to lead them and guide them into all truth right they had an anointing that was true that would come on them and come off of them and cut them on them and come off of them come on David prophesying the first person right they pierced my hands and my feet and but but that anointing could come off of him and he would be just a normal person he'd commit adultery commit murder and all these different things all right but that's what was coming though this new message is that God's going to live inside of you not just on you as an anointing is going to live inside of you then he answered and spake unto me saying I said he said no my Lord this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel now zerubabel was a builder right in the Old Testament actually the word zerubabel means out of Babel out of Babel so where did Brother brandham come from he came right out of Babel this is Babel and that's why he stood and said come out of her my people he brought him out by the new birth and gave him a message gave him an angel gave him gave him a sign gave us a sign and then he said okay let's not follow the sign of the person follow Jesus Christ cuz he's back all right so come out of her my people so come out of her he was in in it he wasn't of the world now remember he was a sinner just like the rest of us all right is everybody with me he was not God that's right he was born of sex he made mistakes he had to eat he got sick he was a daddy father everybody understand that he wasn't Immaculate there was no Immaculate Conception except one so the Bible tells us in zeru that zerubabel being this great Builder that now zachariah's going to tell zerubabel said look he answered and spake unto me saying now this is the Angel talking to zerubabel this is the word of the Lord or talking to u to Zachariah all right so this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so the word of the Lord came to zerubabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who out thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain in other words he had to start somewhere and build up to this Mountain so it's going to be a plane when he gets here it's going to be flat all denominations were flat when brother Brown got here you understand what I'm saying this is a little bit of tip this is what I say Bible days but now that Bible days is correct is to me and you because we're supposed to take the message and now Build That Mountain yes right there's not a real zable here brother ROM's not here that's right we have Mighty Men though that can build this thing that can build the temple back not the temple over there in Israel but the temple right here sir all right everybody with me and he shall bring forth The Headstone so there is your identification that that zerubabel is our last seventh day messenger cuz no one brought the headstone message except William Mar brandom no one pieces parts I'll agree with you the whole bringing of The Headstone uhuh only one man and you and I are under that message to her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age listen everything we do is final everything we do now remember God moves on and goes to Israel but everything we do in this Gentile dispensation is over when we leave this place right no one else will be saved I listened to a um a minister the other day I I watched listened to the Moody Bible Institute cuz this big time in Chattanooga and green and Nashville so when I'm going to the to the uh hunting camp I turn them on and listen and they they one brother he did the best he could they asked him about certain things and you could tell it was denominational because he didn't understand he didn't understand he was putting us into tribulation and being able to get saved now that's their Doctrine y'all know that I hope you know that now right the doctrine is if you don't make it you're a Baptist if you don't make it you got another chance to make it into the you know when you in the tribulation and all he had the souls under the altar being tribulation people and thank God for a prophet I didn't sit there and I didn't sit there and criticize a man but I said Hallelujah yes sir I know what you were talking about Lord cuz you sent me a prophet to tell us exactly who the souls under the altar are where do we go in the not in the tri we're not going to be in the tribulation where are we going to be we're going to be in glory so there he's going to bring forth The Headstone Now who is the head of the church Jesus Christ is the head of the church so he's going to bring Jesus Christ in power back to the Earth again by the word of God not bringing back physical right all right therefore shouting crying what Grace and that's what I was thanking God I said Lord thank God for grace that you gave me a message not criticizing the man he was doing he was stumbling through that it was a it was a a questions and answers they call in and say hey what about this what this and probably 50% of the questions he answered wrong but he answered he said that's he said that's all I know they asked him about where we're going to be he he said that when we got into tribulation period there would be a there would be some kind of transition for us to get in the Millennium but he never answered it he said well I'll just leave that up to God well that's okay but God sent us a message and God spoke to us and told us what these things are all right moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it what is his hands his hands is his workmen you work with your hands right we are his workmen Made In His Image so zerubabel is not here in type brother ROM was Rubble I hope you understand that he laid the foundation but then his hands shall finish it which is us the laborers the ones that are still here and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you we know God sent us a prophet I hope you do for who H has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice they they is you so let's say I shall rejoice let's say I shall rejoice are we rejoicing cuz God sent us a prophet he sent us as a rable he sent us a master builder put the foundation down and say all right guys build it I'm not waiting for Brother Brown to come back and build it you'll be left here with the 10 foolish virgin five foolish virgins now watch this right here and they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel now I I know um some of y'all are not old enough but when when I used to watch them old men build houses and so did Brother Gary it was called a plum Bob right had a piece of lead that had a that had that was sharp almost looked like a top a spinning top you understand what I'm saying and it was made of lead really heavy you put it on a string and you would take that string and if you wanted to start a start a corner or take a corner a point it wasn't laser like we do now you just laser shoot it you had to literally put that well what happened that plummet was straight that's the straightest you could get right at the time that was it remember brother Dell telling us how a long time ago men used to they didn't have levels so they put water in the Floor of a house to make sure that it was level that the floor was level what we come to now we just we got to level I got to level on my phone among other things but but zerubabel was sent with a plummet in his hand in other words to get it all straight you got to have a plummet or we called him a plum Bob that's right which would be something that you hang down it had to be straight it couldn't be crooked it had to be straight and what you do is is you'd put get it right to the ground and you just sometimes I've watched them just touch the ground and there's the point sticking down there's the point make a divot in the ground right brother Gary that kind of put the divot in the ground and that's where you started from so thank God he sent us a prophet with a plummet in his hand all right so let's look at this just for a minute with these seven that's what I said this is not Bible times this is Bible being made real to me and you all right with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth so let's look at these points remember the zerubu meant sown in Babylon all right so he come out of Babylon he came out of the Baptist Church he came out of denominations right and brought us a message and this man is going to bring the headstone something no one else has done before ever even even brother Paul as great as he is he did not bring us The Headstone message he could look at it he could look at the glass Darkly he could see something but he could not put it together you know why cuz you and I were not there to feed on it remember God's not going to cast his bread Before Swine he's not going he said whatever I preach in other words if I cast it it's going to come back well it's got to fall in the right people first that's right so I'm telling you folks this is all we got World ain't going to make us better this is the only thing that's going to Rapture us is this message of the hour nothing else right nothing else so the word hands like I said before means power I even looked it up that word you know that the right hand mean or the hands means power so zerubabel was going to have the power to to build and then the power to hand it to somebody by hand hand it to somebody and then use a plummet a plummet is a leveling tool so what did Brother random do when he came here he leveled the word up the word wasn't off man was off man got off even got off that whole Foundation man got off of it everybody with me so now let's go to First Kings I've quoted this the other day but just for something short we'll um you know brother Bown said one time he said if you can't read read every verse and see Christ Now where's Christ Christ is in you Christ is in you so if you can't see you in every verse something the good and the bad but the good watch this and it came to pass when midday was passed now what happened Elijah is on the scene first first Elijah was on the scene he makes a challenge come on up here and let's see if Ba's God or let's see if God be God the god of Israel or the god of baale one of the two which we're going to have a showdown right here on top of this mountain remember brother R said we would have a showdown in the end time it'd be on Mount Transfiguration amen Mount Zion I mean which is us and it came to pass when midday was passed all Church Ages were over right midday we're not in the middle of church ages were in the evening time yes so they fought and they cut each other and they it was a horrible scene and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice yes are we not in evening time oh yes now they had got so where they couldn't even talk that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded there was nothing happening all Church ages nothing happening they actually jumped up on the Altar and pitched such a fit they tore it all down the altar was scattered everywhere right a safe space I didn't read that but you'll go up a little bit higher you can read that and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar that was broken down brother randam started with the just shall live by faith he went to Wesley's message Pentecost and then he brought his message but he didn't deny all that other amen but he did tell those Pentecostals he said look you got your church order wrong Baptist you got your church order wrong all your different ones you got your church order wrong you're doing this you're doing that this is the way to do it that was he was a repairer of the altar of God which what is in Your Heart Right and all of us obviously were broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came and saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones now what is a stone a stone is a revelation so he takes these Revelations and he puts them together and God's not going to show up until he does he hasn't showed up already right right now watch he built the altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altars great as would contain two measures of seed that's that's us and he put the wood in order he didn't just throw it up there he put the wood in order cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood four barrels of water justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that Elijah brings us the word amen he's fixing the water the fire's going to fall but there's water going to be there which is me and you washing of the Water by the what by the word he wanted to make sure they didn't have a they didn't have a issue with well that was a real dry sacrifice so it just got consumed no he wanted to wet her down he wanted to make sure that it was impossible that's right impossible to dispute that's why brother random I believe when he started the healing campaign he wanted to he wanted the people people to see without disputation that he was the prophet in the end time but not so much say I'm your Prophet that's right he wanted the people to realize it listen you got to realize it for yourself he said do it the second time second pull and he did do it a third time sir and he did it the third time now when the third pull come guess what's fixing to happen fire is fixing to fall and the water R around the Altar and he filled the trm with water it came to pass now watch at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so in the evening time is when this happens amen that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant yes and that I have done these things at Thy word remember brother Brown preached at Thy word Lord he did it at Thy word he did exactly what God told him yes hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou H has turned their heart back again he's identifying who he is and he's identifying there's a group of people that's going to have their heart turned back they're going to be able to worship right they're going to be able to sacrifice the right way if that don't excite you then you need to find a good ball game or something then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stone and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench we took a Rapture there was not the left brother Dy there was a whole bunch of stuff there there was a whole bunch of stuff here yeah but when God got finished when brother randam finished his message and then somebody picked that message up the fire of this message which is the ministers and the and the Ley of the message it takes this and puts you to our heart and burns out all the junk inside come on somebody and he's going to what he's going to consume you listen we're consumed with everything else but the word of God we're consumed with this or that or the other but we need to be consumed with the fire of God and if you got the Holy Ghost guess what listen they didn't leave a thing they AR going to leave ain't one bride going to be left here and we're going to leave this place because of brother ROM's message we're going to leave this place because God has revealed not that brother random was a prophet that should be already settled but that what he said was a Vindicated word directly from the mind of God knowing what to do with it he said she'll know she has her his potential not brother berner's potential Jesus Christ potential Joshua stood there and the Lord said said Joshua thy servant Moses is gone he's dead right but Joshua didn't just curl up on the side of the road and just start crying and stick his thumb in his mouth because God said as I was with Moses I'll be with you as I was with brother brandom I believe he's going to be with his people cuz we're the Joshua of the day we're the we're the Holy Ghost that's going to take us out over into the promised land right that's are tight that's right that's right all right now Matthew 17:9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man I had been up on the mountain Moses and Elijah had appeared to him um brother R said they told him about his second coming all right so he's come down off the mountain the three um Peter James and John they see this and then they started you know well this just build an altar for all these people no Jesus wanted to build an altar in them right Jesus didn't come to build an altar not a physical altar he came to build an altar in me and you that's the reason that God couldn't get into your altar in the Old Testament there was nothing but bulls and goats to cover your sin it couldn't take it away so God won't dwell in an unclean vessel sure he's anointed them sure at the day that he died he saved those people in the Old Testament come on somebody Elijah's not going to be in Hell Samson's not going to be in Hell sir they're going to be in heaven but they're not going to be bride that's right there is no bride in the Old Testament not a gentile one now remember he had a bride Israel and he divorced her put her away to marry a gentile bride we're going to be the ones in incapacity and I mean get stay in the city the great Elijah the great Abraham the great Moses if they're bble to live in that City then it's something set aside for him because brother Brown said that city was made just for the bride right amen Moses is not bride Elijah is not bride Malachi is not bride they spoke of a bride they spoke of a bride that's why I said we're living the time now we're not just living in Bible days that has become alive in me and you right now it's our day yes to make that manifest amen Matthew says okay and says tell the vision to know man in other words don't tell anybody what you saw cuz they're not going to be able to understand it until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then shall the scri now why then say those disciples are going right back to the scripture I just read you they go right back to Malachi because they read Malachi remember Malachi was in the Old Testament and the disciples said why then say the scribes that Elish must first come they're actually quoting Malachi for okay and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now stop right here John the Baptist didn't do that right that's right right he was the hinge pin between the Old and New Testament and he introduced the Messiah he didn't straighten anybody out he tried one time and got his head chopped off for it so Jesus this by Revelation you can see that he said you're not going to understand this until the son of man be risen again in the end time remember they killed him through denominational ideas brother R said you crucified him again amen remember he indicted this whole generation he indicted the Baptist Methodist Pentecostals he said you killed Jesus Christ and put him out on the cross amen that's right that's the problem with they can't get him off the cross and get him inside of oh yeah Jesus died we know that beautiful wonderful he's got to get inside of you first for him to do any good Jesus answered and said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now he's talking to me and you yes sir this is the day that Elijah that Elijah cuz watch what he said right here in just a minute that Elijah right there but I say unto you that Elias is come already now he's talking about John the Baptist CU physically they know him they see him he's right there they know he's a little bit weird he eats a little bit his diet's a little weird but he introduced the Messiah he introduced in other words the disciple says hey we know that's John John introduced us to you but what did Brother random do he didn't introduce us to himself he introduced us to Jesus Christ then we came out of the prison amen thank you Lord but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever the original says that was listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of what now who did who did the son of man suffer from he suffered from the denominational world of the day amen he suffered from the scribes and Pharisees and caiaphus and high priests that's where he got it he suffered that's right so also the son of man suffer them so when the message comes back in the end time like it today we will suffer that kind of persecution you will suffer if you try to tell somebody about the truth of the message of the hour right you know there's no way I'm not going to cast my pearls against uh to the swine I'm not going to call that guy on the phone and try to give him a a f minute dissertation how wrong he was amen I'm just thankful in my heart and I pray God get him s what the the the the prayer should be God get him to somebody that can help him he was trying to help people and he was giving them the wrong answer they said oh great that's fine thank you he'd hang up next one the call and say what about this well yeah okay thank you and they just took and accepted it as as as what you know what God was saying and absolutely is not true we will not the bride will not see a speck of tribulation we'll be out of here by that time praise God's name forever don't worry about bomb falling his whole world is worried that somebody's going to press a button there's one button I want to press That's the eject button and I want to be like that sacrifice I want to be laid on the altar I want to be told that here comes the fire and I'm out of here the Bible even says that there wasn't even dust left aren't we not dust there won't even be dust left pieces and parts are you not going to be scattered around everywhere we're going as a whole we're going home it's going home time it's 100% it's going home time yes likewise shall also so the son of man suffer of them who's them the religious world then the disciples understood that he spake of them John the Baptist obviously that was their Revelation but our PR present day Revelation is that that was not the Elijah that was sent to us that Elijah was sent to them see what it says right there that Elijah that Elijah was sent to them cuz he's come already and they knew him not not but the scripture before that he's talking about brother brandham he's talking about Elijah number four cuz he didn't nobody restored all things except the Elijah in the end time that's right He restored everything back praise God God didn't send us God didn't send us a half message he didn't send us something to wonder about he sent us something to believe and then let that connect to what's in your soul and you got to be able to say that ain't nothing but the truth folks if then ain't the truth come on you can't find it you sit there and listen and I listened to that brother and he was some theologian he had some kind of doctor degree and he was from whatever College Moody Bible college or something like that and he' been taught those things right I'm like man all that learning and half what you're saying is false that's what we've come to now this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelations 10 is going to do two things we read this before but we're going to read it again because if you don't see that brother random had a transition from a Healing Ministry to a a to a Perfection Ministry or transition from partial to perfect then you've missed it and if you still think about all the healing you missed it again God has moved on through that he's moved into the healing of the Soul not so much the healing of the body I know God heals us every day we know that right but we're looking as I read y'all 100 quotes in the past sever months where brother R said not in the years of preparation you've missed you're majoring on a minor a minor is that first part of his ministry all right the major is what we're sitting in today we can't go back I'll promise you one thing if William brandham stood in this pull pit right here there'd be no more people than they are today come on cuz you know what they'll say well I don't think it's him well it looks like him but might not be him well what he's saying is he's saying that we're all wrong well that's not Willam brandom then out the door you go hello somebody well brother Brown was here I'd get healed you're a weak Christian absolute weakest there ever was in in your life you're as weak as you can be if you think brother Brandon's going to heal you by coming back sir sir no I'm sorry it may it may uh rub your feathers but guess what I'm not waiting around for somebody to come back except Jesus Christ to pick me up amen cuz nobody can change your body except Jesus Christ now the message of the hour plus you is going to get us out of here it's going to change our body so one according to Malachi four he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers Pentecostal babies to mature adult Christians all right cuz you know brother Brown brother brand brother Dell told us years and years and years God's not going to Rapture babies amen the body change is not going to come to babies it's going to come to somebody that knows how to handle the word of God and if it means sitting here and listening and praying and reading your Bible that's the only way I know you're going to get it so that first part he going to turn the hearts of the children what go in among the Pentecostal babies bring a healing Campaign which is the bait on the hook but they just got the bait and left the hook yes the hook was is to bring them into this second part but guess what didn't happen you know why the fish that he needed to catch is sitting here right now the fish he wanted to catch was not in there now there might be some of you sister cing someone been in meetings before but I'm not talking about that I ain't talking about being in a place physically I'm talking about in spiritual form you you can be 90 years old and be a baby praise the Lord anyhow age has nothing to do with Revelation I believe God can speak to these young people and give them Revelation that will help them dur their during their daily journey and it don't have to come from Mom and Daddy now I know Mom and listen Mom and Daddy's got to be your head that my that that we have a headship don't tell me that don't tell me kids that you can go over here and say now now God spoke to me and told me I could have a tattoo now let's go back over to Leviticus and talk about marking your body with ink all right put it back in the word kids if you can put in the word of God we'll deal with it but if it's just some thought you got I'm talking you adults too number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders we're going to get into all that we're going to get into all the major doctrines here pretty quick it's coming up cold weather and now the times changed and y'all won't have so much to do maybe you start coming to church two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals now the Seven Seals were sealed up right right why were it sealed up cuz God over here in the beginning gave that book to Adam amen amen and the ability to open it right and that book has a book of names in it and it's mine and yours but when he couldn't do that when he had sex with Eve just be plain when he po when the womb was polluted first in her brain then him he accepted it and took a part of it or don't knock that over then he accepted it and sold out brother Brown said he sold me and you out he said he sold the whole human race out listen we blame Eve for a lot Adam was the one that sold us out that's the first Adam couldn't take us to Perfection I just got that the first Adam could not take us to Perfection he wasn't a savior he tried to be and en type he was cuz he saved Eve he took her and said no no no if you're going to kill her you got to kill me and know what Moses did Moses said if you're going to kill all them people you got to kill me first you got to come over me ain't what brother said about Abraham and Sarah God would have killed Sarah if it was for Abraham so sure Adam typed Christ but he wasn't Christ right we have Christ now folks we don't have an Adam first we have a second Adam it's going to take us out of here oh praise the Lord it will be be it will be these divinely not just revealed divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pastal fathers that's why I said we are literally making the word of God manifest literally as I said before and you're not I know you don't get it some of you don't some of you do we're not a type that's right everything in the Bible types the bride everything types the real literal means real listen I'm not I'm not coming to church I'm standing in church I'm literally here you ain't got to guess you ain't got to wonder if I'm going to get here I'm standing here right now so guess what no more guessing about Revelation no more guessing about Mysteries no more being able say well that's your opinion that's my opinion Jesus Christ is the only opinion we need to have we're going to get it right or we're wrong you can't be in between that's right correct but consider this this Prophet Messenger will be in his nature and manner as Was Elijah and John the people of this now watch the people of this Prophet messenger's day that's me and you right will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's and since it is only the children whose Hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen yes that's it you've heard about us old people we're all set in our ways except maybe sister Regina she ain't got there yet you started this right can't teach an old dog new tricks can't change an old person they're setting their ways oh you young people are shaking your head like this well all got parents and different ones you're not going to change them only God can change them right amen but what about children though you can change children you can influence children that's my brother of ROM was sent to children now you and I were not Pentecost now some of you come out of Pentecost but we were all babies in Christ when we come in this message what do you mean we got to be baptized it different than than than what I've been living the past 20 years in the Baptist Church what do you mean it's different uh what do you mean this is this what do you mean this is over here what are you talking about you're a baby that's what a baby does but when you grow up you say oh oh that's where you get that from book of Acts acts 238 Peter was saying exactly what Jesus said praise the Lord first Thessalonians we'll be done right here for this we say to you by the word of the Lord now this is Paul talking to somebody for this we say unto you today I say this unto you you that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are sleep that's right as I said before the other day we are not looking for a Rapture yet I know everybody says well I see in the Rapture and we got the rapture's coming there's some things got to happen before the Rapture takes place we got to get this thing right you better have a resurrection inside yourself before you going to be raptured out of here cuz listen in our condition quote from Brother BR in our condition we can't take a Rapture in our condition we better hope God don't come in the morning know everybody's like boy I hope God comes tomorrow well you better check up a little bit Hey listen we're having communion today you better check up a little bit before you do that but you better check up a little bit when you say Lord please come tomorrow you better check up and make sure that you want him to come right and from me all the way in the back right yeah right I want the Lord to come but I want my kids saved you want your loved one saved and you got to hold on till the they quit sucking air right now watch that we which are alive and remain is't that us until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder brother Bown said them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend now we know according to Revelations 10 7 he has already descended in a message everybody with me he has descended in a message and that message is where right here why I said we can take and narrow this thing down and we're we're living exactly what the Bible said right amen for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout three things got to happen voice of the Archangel Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first resurrection first all right then we which are alive and remain are going to be changed yes and caught up with them in a Rapture so we got to get them here you know what the son of man message is in a nutshell the son of man message is the proof of the Resurrection you say how do you know that brother I'm stood he said I can prove Jesus Christ has resurrected he said because number one one he's here and if you can't see him I'm fixing to tell you that last week you ate potato chips and got choked and the doctor was um from India and he drove a green car and he just went right down through your life that wasn't brother random that was the Lord Jesus Christ amen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another Comfort one another that you know this message of the hour comfort that you know that you can come to a church that at least you can hear some of the word of God Rapture message now here brother R let's let him explain it then we'll be done three things happen now this is the rapture message a voice a shout of voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's descending all right he descended in Revelations 10 the mighty Angel comes down with an open book in his hand is that not where we're at now right what he descend in the word the word that brother randam brought opened the veil so that Christ could come in and give it to the people amen a conduit that was used of God to bring it to the people so that you and I cannot be confused like we were before amen a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so there had to be a message come to bring a bride that could hear what's being said that can know what's fixing to happen and they can manifest what's going to happen Rapture again first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it listen if I go stand over here somewhere outside and I open that door and I go hey what are y'all going to do everybody's going to turn their head you're not going to look that way that's right you're going to turn your head toward wherever that shout was that's right why because it what it gets the people's attention listen is a mess what is it it's a is a message to get the people together not separate us get us together a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time remember he's talking about the virgins rise and trim your lamps what watch was that the seventh not the sixth amen the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamp but it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi four time what he proom is Luke 17 is Isaiah all these prophecies that it can that it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scriptures we see it living right there continue on now he's getting pretty personal right here now this is 1965 this is actually about 20 days before he before he died um or or close to it I think he had to W or he died on Christmas Eve so this is getting close 1204 1965 actually he was coming back from Arizona when he got killed so he was preaching this is his last part of his message when I went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I came with a message all right if any message Goes Forth it's a true message if it's the true genuine miracles of god and hangs right in that organization you know it's not of God cuz that thing is already declared in other words it's already cursed it's dead Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes the people then his message that's right it has to have something that God is going to introduce amen right I'm asking you again is we know the first part of the message has been introduced to us the healings and the signs and the Wonders and all that it's undisputable right but when we get into that second part people dispute cuz if you don't have the revelation of the son of man you'll not see it amen cuz Kus and them they were very religious and they didn't see it listen the 12 disciples or the 11 didn't know who Judas was except for the son of man he the only one who knew who it was amen his miracles like just catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message that's what is there's what is what comes from in here he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him for there's some in there that's ordained to life so the shout is brother randam a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of a resurrection which is what the voice of the son of man because the son of man was standing there when he raised Lazarus from the dead and that was the voice of the son of man in other words the voice of the Resurrection same voice a loud voice in St John that called Lazarus from the grave and I put in parenthesis that's where the son of man was standing there amen getting the bride together then the resurrection of the the dead see to be caught up with it now watch these three things take place the next is what a trumpet a shout a voice and trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of the trumpet is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky so you and I are now listening to what the shout we've heard the message the voice of the Archangel is going to come through the bride it's got to right right at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him now remember they all woke up all 10 woke up but five were ready and five were not then all those virgins Rose and trimmed the lamps and the foolish said un the wise give us over your oil for our lamps are gone out we didn't study like you did we didn't go to church like you did we didn't get the correct message like you did hello somebody and that what it is they got something wrong somewhere cuz they didn't make the Rapture if you don't make the Rapture you going to have something wrong and it's not God's fault and we know what happened proving his word let's read this one right here not no more as a church cuz the son of man is being revealed now watch not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this what through this message yes nothing else amen when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together your human flesh amen the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the Manifest ation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy right see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already United when you get born again you're you're we have a marriage marriage down here then we go to the supper all right everybody with me when the word here unites with the person and they two become one and then that and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done now if you want to know how the end time people act read Matthew Mark Luke and John that's what the son of man acted like CU it was him and he's our example whatever the son of man done he was the word and the church does the same thing amen let's stand to our feet come on musician just for a minute we'll sing a song He said look he says in the form of people not Son of God not son of David but son of man the Son of God was the supernatural what first part of his ministry was the son of God under the Son of God Ministry he was just bringing back the gifts he was just restoring what had been done for for years through prophets they had prophesied they had told people they had told dreams Daniel was a great dream teller and or revealer and so it was different ones uh but it wasn't just that it was the message that was behind that is what we're to catch but just before the promised son come God revealed himself as a man in human flesh and read the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in the room behind him now if you just take that right there and read that he's saying he's the son of man but that's not right you know that as well as I do that's not right just before the promised son come God revealed himself as a man in human flesh yeah he's going to anytime Jesus is going to be be revealed in the end time it's got to be through me and you it's got to he picked it that way it's got to be through human flesh it's got to be through the bride in the end time when the son of man shall be revealed the son of man being revealed not the Son of God in the church age that's why we're done with the church age he's put out of that right now he's son of man reving himself the word is becoming flesh Among Us do you believe that let's sing a song Jesus is myi I shall not be moved in his love and favor I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water oh I shall not be m sing it to him oh I shall not be I shall not be mo why don't somebody come to tell you brother R's a false prophet that shake you and move you water oh I shall not be moved oh in my Christ abiding I shall not be mve in his love I'm hiding I shall not be moved just like a tree that's landed by the water oh I shall not be moved sing it to him oh I shall whatever come I shall not be moved the devil raes I shall not be moved just like a tree that's pled by the there I shall not be moved amen you love the Lord it's almost 12 we come back at 2:00 we have communion and foot washing and answer a couple of questions it shouldn't take too long till we get to that second one but uh I'm looking for great things in the Lord amen he's revealing his word people are catching it people are catching on but let's pray for the ones that that's not catching on let's pray for those people that um that are dilatory I mean we have to this is if this is lamp trimming time we better trim our lamps you know what how many people know what a lamp trimming is not many in the old times we have two we have two hurricane lamps at the house in case the power goes out flashlights are okay but boy them hurricane lamps they got the oil in it already and this got a wick and you turn it like this all right is everybody with me just for a second then we'll go and that Wick goes up like this right right then you light it and it it it sucks that oil up through that cotton right up into this place right here well now as it burns when you get finished when when the power comes back on praise God for the power company amen well until you get your bill and uh then you you blow that out what happens it gets real black and and the residue is still there all right now when you try to light it again it'll Li but it'll go it'll spit and sputter and spur and it won't be very good but if you take a take a a of scissors and trim your lamp trim the part you don't need off anymore go right down there below that uh soot burnt spot cut that off and man when you light that baby up it'll give you light like you wouldn't believe well that's what he's talking about lamp trimming time we've got we've got oil we've got some light but it's dim but there shall be light in the evening time when it is the dmst time there shall be light and you are that light because we trim our lamp we come to church we read our Bible we do the things we're supposed to do you love the
