he got married was six foot tall he's been downhill ever since Hey Brother Ray it's that same law that I always say about Joyce it must be the uh unless they would have to call it the moat and since Kathy I don't know your name before you got married whatever that name is but they changed the law now you can't marry without getting your mom and dad to sign it after 18 and I know you saw when when you married Brother Ray that he was a lot younger than 18 when you swept him off his feet like Joyce did Danny Danny was 14 when they got married so and there is a law against that now they've changed it sorry to say but we will sing happy anniversary if you all right y'all look into that camera right there brother Ray sister Kathy and get red turn red and all that yes because they're looking right

be seated well brother Terence beat me to it but I was going to say something about Brother Ray sister Kathy heaven anniversary today and uh you know we're on the week of the Fourth of July and that's on the fourth of July is when all our liberties and Freedoms come into existence back but 250 years ago I forget what it was anyhow but they're slowly but surely being taken away from us and I think it's because the people forget and I think that that's the reason why we're in a situation well with the scriptures today is they uh coming out of the upper room and on in they started watering it down watering it down you know and we had to have a profit coming in time to straighten all of these things out so anyhow I believe that that's what our situation is and we was talking down there a while ago was getting to wear certain things if a preacher won't marry a uh a gay or a lesbian couple that they'll shut the church down and stuff like that you know and we're getting in that position and the reason why we're getting there is because we're allowing it to happen amen we're going to start off we're going to sing a battle human Republic that's going to be 387 in the red book and it's uh I don't know what the same words or not but it's in the anyhow we invited mine eyes are seeing the glory of the time I don't live even believed it I can't read the righteousness he has sounded

little uh thought just a minute how America's changed amen I was my brother and I are 18 months apart and we lived outside up in Indiana up north outside Chicago about 130 000 people in the town but we were the age of Paul and his little brother there and we would get on a bus and we could ride 20 bucks or so anywhere we wanted to go nobody bother you we'd go to her grandmother's house we get off at the right stops but that's not the way it is today amen I had a song on my heart here but it's a cassette and they don't do that anymore so we got another song hey man B flat once my soul was a stream as could be by myself for me foreign I was Nearing to her when he came to be there and he showed me that I could be free Glory complete Winnie rebound his hand for me my heart does Rejoice

like turning your scriptures during when we've been reading from Romans 7. really enjoyed brother Bob this morning done a wonderful job I told him I said here I got to go follow you up and preach behind you you've done a good job amen remember the announcements remember Wade and June and them will be traveling back he's preaching over at brother Dutch's this afternoon or this morning this afternoon and then he'll be preaching Lord within Wednesday so remember him and keep him in your prayers and I'm traveling more the Lord will be with him Bible study is coming Saturday six o'clock the topic is the rapture and Minister's meeting will be here on the second Saturday of July in the next few ministers want to come and be and come ahead we have a time set aside for that I think it starts at 11 o'clock if there's any difference in that you check it out it's got to be 10 or 11. so it's somewhere right in there maybe 10 o'clock all right but then the fellowship meeting will be at brother Tom corsaine's uh on the third Saturday anybody wants to go with us let us know ahead of time it is 10 o'clock okay The Minister's meeting um got the officials said it was 10 o'clock so we'll make sure and do that all right we really appreciate you know this coming Thursday will be the Fourth of July and we really thank God for our freedom that we have to at least this time to be able to serve the Lord you know we came to America not as a freedom of religion that's actually not what it was it was a freedom from religion he said well what's the difference well there's a whole lot of difference in being you know from religion or freedom of religion because we you know we came here and you'll see in the message today you know we came here to get away from religious ideas right right that was the reason of coming to America freedom from religion you know to get us away from all of the the man-made ideas and things and and all and the Lord has helped us and blessed us in this nation greatly you know it's fastly going away like brother dick was talking about that you know maybe there'll come a time when if you won't do a wedding for lesbians or gays or whatever uh they'll close the church well there's only one question I want to ask and this is not funny at all if they ask me will I do a wedding for something like that and I refuse to and they closed me up I want them to answer one question is it all right for me to do a wedding for a man or a woman to marry a monkey ain't nobody life and so you know it's not a joke if we believe in evolution and we believe we all evolve from one thing down we just hire a form of animal well why don't you just let the people marry their dogs and their cats and get them off on their income tax that's true right I thought we just saw monkeys but it's all people all the same oh that no no no no no no no no well all right that's what I said it ain't funny it's true it's a serious hour right all right Romans 7 uh is that all announcements have I missed any I generally missed some announcement brother George Quinn will be with us on the uh about the Second Sunday in August and I think it's the 10th 11th 11th of August so remember that and be much in prayer for him father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us we pray today that you would just help us and guide us and give us understanding Lord Of Thee in Your Love and Father we pray that you would just come this day and truly we do thank you for our freedom and Lord It's your freedom from a religious Society that a group mankind so much until we came here to try to get away from all of those ideas and establish a land that we could have the freedom that you could not force religion upon anybody that we could all serve thee out of our thoughts of our own minds and hearts and Lord that we see that fastly going away but we know that you said you'd raise up a standard against it so we pray that you would just bless and God we love you and we thank you just have your way Lord let your grace be sufficient for us today as we speak about you in Jesus name Romans 7. oh another thing too uh some of us talking the other day you know we have the ability to now to find out whether or not you that miss the services a lot of times are listening come find out some of you that are missing there's no listening in your town okay see we can just search and see just to get ill if there's anybody in Doraville listening and you say well I listened you say what I okay not funny it's true Romans 7 I want to try to bring this to a possible conclusion today maybe be a little bit lent if it is forgiving uh I'll try not to go too far but then we may have we will have questions and answers on this if anybody has any questions anything you know comments Etc turn them in we will try to cover those but trying to bring this down to a conclusion no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how does the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband now remember the prophet said on invisible Union that this is a prophecy for the church in the end times so now what we see here move it from the new birth that's what we want to do today move it from the New Birth up into marital situations of life and then take it into the greater portion he called it of marriage and divorce the greatest portion law and Grace now that's what I'm trying I want to try to bring if I can today to that point so then we see that for which I'm which for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband lives she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brother and you also are become dead to the law how by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death see there's your new birth marrying to Christ verse 5. marriage and divorce situations of Life while we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law you know not the Ten Commandments the law the the things that we interpreted it to be why did the prophet say we had to marriage in divorce situation misinterpreted theology all right now watch through this next verse but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were hail that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldest of the letter you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word what is it the scripture the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life all right now as I said a prophecy for the church that's paragraph 23 invisible Union he said this is pertaining Romans 7 to a greater portion of marriage and divorce paragraph 35 which unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy what is it we talk about prophecy a setting in order of scriptures aligning up of scriptures of showing that what you start with in Genesis you wind up in Revelations not changing and having a white horse here and a black horse here and doing those things but coming to a basis of seeing something all the way through the Bible all right and then coming out to the end to where we're at now remember what we were speaking about and been speaking on of the the church choosing law for Grace or instead of Grace thinking it was Grace or God's will and then thinking about it as we've tried to bring out the other day in a couple of messages that the children of Israel did not want a great big bunch of burdensome roots I mean I don't believe that if you do then that's all right that's your business but I'm I'm just don't think that away and you know who would want to stand on your head for the rest of your life you say watch silly they wouldn't have done that well it's burden some rules any rules you have is a burdensome thing to try to follow unless you want to do it out of love now come on sisters be honest with me sometimes it's a burdensome thing to have long hair right because you got to fix it you got to do it you got to do everything but yet why is it that you have the long hair because you know it's following the word because the word tells you not to cut your heart and then the scripture says even don't don't the the nature teach you your nature of a new birth puts you to a position that when you're combing that higher and fixing that you may be saying well you know this is burdensome but yet I'm doing it out of love it's not a burdensome thing to be a Christian it's not a book of rules to be a Christian it's an opportunity to serve God from an inward experience of a life that would be made outwardly that if there would be no other reason than be then just try to show the world to God in your life all right now you see why did I spoke a couple of services about that the children of Israel wanted to be like the neighbors the Nations around them that was what they were wanting not a book of rules to keep put something to be like the others they could see those people doing things and working and building churches and and God was just letting them just travel along right they wanted to be like the neighbors and they got down into it trying to express it there the other night what is it that we want to do well we want to go through rituals like the so-and-so does you know churches denomination we want to speak in tongues like the Pentecostals we want to do this we want to do that we want to have something that we can train a people come up and get them to go back and you know that's done in organized religion it's either get up and make a statement then you got to make it perfectly like you told me in the when I was being ordained as a deacon at 23 years old some of the old deacons told me said you know if you don't have an answer just tell them you don't have an answer don't try to make up one because it they'll trap you well see he'd been through it himself you know but but the thing that I've tried to get you to see is they wanted to be like the Nations around them but you know God never did want them to be a nation well they're called a nation of it right there's a reason for that see they were not to be a nation none whatsoever until they had crossed the land the Jordan River into Canaan land it was the only time they were to be settled down right they were the people of God God told them there in Exodus 19. you are this your Royal peace or you're this you're a great people they wanted to be a nation I didn't want him to be a nation he didn't want him to settle down in no place but once they crossed into Canaan right they could settle down and God could use the word of nation for him but he didn't want him to do that in the beginning you know what they were little brown said when they were down in Egypt he said they were the people of God he said but then when they left Egypt in their Journey they became the Church of God the called out see they should have waited until he went to Canaan to even think about a nation or a nationality or or whatever because they they wasn't they were just so many from tribe of Judah so many from the tribe of this so many of these tribes they were just fellowshiping together because they were Ken folks you know but they had tribes set aside not didn't want him to be a nation God don't want us to settle down he's always wanted the people to move on that's where the trouble was see they settled down in the days of Martin Luther and formed an organization out of it tried to be a nation like everybody else wanting to be a nation you know we're not a nation we're individuals right God don't deal with Nations but around the city don't deal with two people at the time you say well that's just talking about a prophet well that wasn't exactly all of it or he he doesn't deal with two people at the same time he deals with an individual now as individuals then we can form into as to being what we are called to be of the parts we are to be of the body of Christ with a hand armed feet you know we can become an organism as the body of Christ but like Israel we form an organization and when we do we denominate and die where is any denomination that ever formed organized and formed come back to be any church that God is dealing with and he said but they're having revivals they're having this and having that well don't you see my whole point of what I'm driving there the children of Israel looked over and seen them people over there and they were working theirself to death for their gods and they wanted to do it they were never just happy to say we're the people of God if we need help we just call on the prophet because that's what Nathan and core said you're too spiritual you know you you want nobody to have it with you they couldn't believe us he said to one man message nah thinking about those things because that's what I'm looking down on the notes of the prophet they were never chosen to be a nation I said that Wednesday and I knew that probably it didn't go over by a lot of people so we'll read a little bit about it but there was never to be a nation see when I say something some of you here you know maybe argue that point Lee well what do you mean of the nation of Israel well that's why I read what the prophet said then you're not arguing with me you're arguing with him all right so then let's get a few little points out of the way and then we'll get into the thought of the message go ahead and pull up number one which is a tie Tire in church age in 1960 1208. look what he says coming down has not just Doctrine to Bible we found out last night that Israel coming through Moab there was not a nation it wasn't a nation they dwelled in the face upon the face of the Earth and they was a people free is that right there was no Nation like I said the only time they would have had a point of being a nation would have been when they went into the land of Canaan and then they would settle down with building a temple building a a worship thing and building a central location for them all to be kind of linked around up until that time it was never to been nothing like that it was not to be a nation look at the next one I'll read look at number two dedication of a building 59 708 in the morning God dwells among his people as he called him out of Egypt they were the people of God now look he chose them as a nation well you know you just got to say anyone the nation Angel it wasn't a nation when it come out that's words that's getting over to a point that he chose them out of the Nations it wasn't chosen to be a nation well that's what he said now we'll go ahead do what you want to but he said to Peculiar people or royal priesthood he chose this certain people but as long as they were dwelling in Egypt and Scattered they were the people of God but when he called him out they then were then the Church of God because the word church means separated called out they become the Church of God the not a nation they become the Church of God okay look at the next one Earnest we continue for the face it was once to deliver to the Saints 53 614 a God said I've seen him from the hilltops Hallelujah his church his group one day wasn't a nation there wasn't an organized like the rest of the people they win the nation they weren't organized they had organism but no Nation he said the people will dwell among themselves there will not be a nation and that's the way the Church of God today the called out group of people it doesn't mean because it's your Methodist here it doesn't mean because you're a pinnacle it means out of every group God's calling people giving them the Holy Ghost and that's the the church the called out certainly it is he calls them out they're not an organization they're an organism their hearts are beating together they're one in Christ Jesus Hallelujah all right now watch what he says in the next one just once more Lord 63 uh one 120 in the evening a paragraph just wants more and that we're on yeah excuse me I'm on it you got it this is sure there's somewhere and then you got number four yeah that was just another about organization where he said brother run said he rejects organization he don't reject organism but organization organism we have to have that the children of Israel were a chosen people but when one of them got into trouble they all went right because they were the people of God don't want us to be a nation he wants us to be his people serve him as an individual to be what is done and then you see then the show that is right you'd see in each case sometimes like uh the the great ones that would raise up and fought you know and kill people individuals he doesn't want us a nation but we only do like the Baptist we want to get a prettier Church we want to build a bigger building we want to get everything just right we want to be like them well we're not supposed to be like them that's why in this church as long as I stay here as a pastor there'll never be a membership role because you don't join the body of Christ you're born into it there's no membership here it's not where you you come here you know nobody puts a collection plate under your nose expecting you to pay your tithe I expect all Christians to so if you're here anywhere else I'd expect you to because that's a Christian if you don't then I question your Christianity come on it's no problem but we're not to be we're supposed we're not to be like them no don't you think we could get this together oh brother dick don't mind this one but he said when we first met see he was in that Presbyterian and they had their four spiritual laws and ways of explaining he said ain't there some way we can get this together as a group to explain it I told him in I said can't be done well I know that kind of throat him because he wasn't thinking my way it can't be done you can't put this message into a cubicle of some form or from and try to pass it out to the people that way because everybody's an individual everybody's an individual I'd like to deal with you individually because you're an individual I'd like to talk to you individually you see that when we go outside I I go and shake hands with everybody because it's individuals if I don't shake your hand it's your fault go and I do try individuals then make up the body of Christ in that way the body of Christ is the called out of the system right so God don't reject organisms but he rejects organizations he said what's a different organization organism an organization says this is it or the period on the end of it an organism says this is the word of God with a comma anything God will reveal well no bless God we're in the message now what's an organization Spirit jump up we're in the message this is the it this is it this is the period this is the period this message is a period and when you do that you know what you've done you just died I don't care you don't make nothing for me we're individuals when you denominate the prophet said you die you organize you die you say this is it don't you believe brother Dale this message is it yes but there's a message of tear down through the endless ages that this Prophet spoke of so he put a comma onto his sermon his message never ended with a period he said there'll be a message of tear down through the ages to come after we leave here so he never denominated it he never organized it let's see if we say this is it we ain't taking nothing else remember we ain't got that message of Jerry yet so what if you turn that down listen Church I think it's you know finishing up time I believe it's a very serious hour all right but listen God deals with individuals watch what he says on the next one getting these in the way and through and then we'll read look at number five which is just once more watch what he says happen now the church this is just once more 63 uh 112 an evening the church Pentecostal Church turned right back around and married into the thing that God pulled him out four right that's what he says can't deal with a group God can't deal with a group one two people two opinions right two people two opinions right God deals with an individual it's always been his policy two men has got two different ideas God gets one man in his that's all he has to have one man that's what he's trying to get today he's trying to get you in his hand because I ain't speaking just him is it you in his hand he'll take one year and one dire it'll never be a group she'll just get that out of your mind well brother don't you think that we could come on you know compromise a little bit and associate with some of these churches I don't compromise to associate I've been accused of being an antichrist spirit because I go to the fellowship meeting and I don't tell you to go if you want to you're welcome to Ride Along all right because I'm not going to compromise with nobody you remember we were red right around and said the Christian businessmen was the only group he was a member of he said but when they organize I'll get out of it he was talking to the businessman at the time he said I don't want to get around them spirits well go ahead go to Walmart while we're going to the fellowship meeting no that don't go over good does it that makes me a smart alec I might be an illick but I never have been smart when you're organized right then you lose watch what he said now when you organize or read it to you the other day he said you die look what he says happen when you organize right then you lose you're you lose your Birthright I want to ask any person where did you ever see a man raise up with the message of God and as soon as he left the Earth they organized it and as soon as they organized it died and never did come back again now show me one of them I'm honest Today Show me one of them well my churches look at what's going on yeah and what do you got in church painted face Jezebel shorts wearing even bikinis in some you call that of God but it never was come back it's not an ounce of the Living God in there your thermometer is gone it's 40 below zero he says you lose your Birthright now you mean to tell me another I'm honest if you lose your Birthright that really means you must not have never had the birth you just had to birth right you were in line for it but if we went back and went to an organized religion today then I'd be proven I never had anything to start with I mean that's no problem it wouldn't be that way but see God deals with individuals what organizations do is one thing I want to just get this and then because I'm bringing down this point then we'll quit and preach a little while look at the next one what he talks about what organizations do which is Satan's eating I had a whole page of Satan's Eden I'd suggest you listen to the whole message 65 829 Satan's Eden paragraph 65. and he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the stars and he would sit like he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his stretch brother Reynolds said one time when they accepted Barabbas and rejected Jesus it exalted Satan to the throne that he wanted now look what organized religion does my brother Dallas Good Feet right we're not against organisms we're against what did the prophet say the system the system you ever looked up word system let me get that before we even go too far you ever looked up the word system to see why brother random was against the system well I know because it was systematically it means a system is an assemblage our combination of things or parts forming a complex or unitary hold you turn w-h-o-l-e-ho it's an ordered or comprehensive assemblage of facts principles or methods what is a system then why would he be against a system a system would be the organization of gathering together an assemblies he was against the organization not against the organism you say I'm not even against organization because he said that's all right that'll lead you there you know they can do good things but where are we at if you can't see by the last couple of messages I've preached now and I know this is hard and I'm sorry but the biggest portion of the people of this message had already organized if you can't see that then you're blind so I'm not talking to y'all just preaching the rest of them you get your eyes open one day you'll see what I'm talking about be that way give us a little something do something what sugar tits when we're supposed to be Sons and Daughters of God I thought the prophet said that you couldn't hurt a child of God's feelings that was my understanding did I miss it somewhere no I'm sure that don't mean all my feelings can't be heard he didn't say his feelings couldn't be hurt but what you can't take a person that's born again they're going to understand and if even they don't understand they don't understand one thing they'll pray for you right because that's what we're supposed to be as Christians but look at what he's talking about and look what people do he said it was all himself Satan's he succeeded in carrying out his stress he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his stress how by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age now he succeeded in explaining the way in every age the value of God's promised word to that age right now watch that's exactly how he's done it in every age he explained it away all right so whatever age he has succeeded in explaining away the truth and he said the reason we're into this problem with marriage and divorce is misinterpreted theology why is it there so many churches in the world today when we all claim to be serving the same God I have to agree somewhere I believe somebody missed it don't you I think that's the problem but Satan's what does he do in the church age book he said it his way was to discredit God's word all right now what do you see in the people of this message of preachers what are they doing they're discrediting the prophet to try to show that he's wrong right and when they can discredit that profit then you won't believe him okay so they explain it away now let's go with that first is discredited then explain it away what's the difference in somebody saying brother random was wrong on dates or wrong on this or wrong on that in the spiritual realm now what's the difference in that didn't explain in the way what he taught if we explain away what he taught then the people can't be ready I don't say things to be horrible I know you think I am but some of you saw the man that was supposed to be flying the airplane to haul blood around him around him and his brothers some of you saw the videos he said for that plane to be able to fly take two years to get it together so he plainly telling you Lord can't come for two years I told you my opinion if I believe he's going to do that I'd Hawk and steal everything I could get to get me a 747 and a in about 10 Pilots where I can make sure they would all somebody could fly the booger you know he'd be sitting on the runway and every day they'd have to fly and they'd have to remodel it what you say that's wrong in front of mohammad's grave they have a white horse a guard standing and they changed a white horse every four hours so evidently they believe more than we do I know it that makes me sarcastic hateful arrogant amen find a few more things you can say about me it was like I've always said my worst enemy knows one thing I've got one thing in mind that I said Wednesday night that's to bring you an opportunity to be able to receive the word of God what else is with it I don't care if I die and go to hell that's what I my appointees and wanting to do is to get you an opportunity to see Jesus Christ now so with that out of the way now for a little bit let me just preach to you Heaven helped me to express it the way that I've see it I told you and asked you to the beginning to take the invisible Union and read it over and over and over and in that invisible Union you would find three things that he dealt with one of them is your new birth and he was dealing with that new birth to show us that our old husband which was our old nature coming from the fall it made us lost that that was her old husband and that old husband wasn't just to be divorced and put away he's supposed to be dead if he's not dead we're not born again and we're not free we're not a Christian if that old husband is still alive now you're looking at the old husband the body and spirit of this individual standing here because it's still in his domain and still belonging and operating sometimes according to him you know the devil right now brother Dale don't talk about me and my flesh like that well turn it off what do you see when I'm trying to bring you you read that in invisible Union he said that old husband's got to be dead for you to be married to Christ the word the old husband has got to be dead then he moves on into him talking about and he says this is about marriage and divorce and it gives a little bit on the marriage and divorce situation all right then we know and realized it when he did preach marriage and divorce that as that day came about there were people there that were married four or five times he said they were three four times or something but yet by the grace that he gave they went home with one wife and one husband if they really believed it now what did he cover on the new birth sin to the individual is put into the Sea of his forgetfulness everybody else around you can remember it but God can't okay so you get into the marriage and divorce situation and when you do you know literal things and you see that you needed the grace but if you can believe it that it's for you then you can be free from your marital situation but to go and hide won't do you no good as I said you can always find another organ an organization somewhere in this message it will let you go there and tell you you're free well see I can't do that I can't tell you you have the new birth right because I don't know because you're the only one that knows I can't tell you you're okay in your physical life I can tell you and point you to the message in Christ but I can tell you by the new birth if you have it then that old husband of the world of natural world is dead then we can be as Paul would say not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me that old husband is dead then if you can truly believe it and follow it correctly and line up with it that you can say my old marriage and where I've been married before is placed in the sea of his forgetfulness because that's what that Prophet said when he said that day go home as you are right he said Paul saw his people in this shape Moses saw these people he said and God counted righteousness so God put our old magical lives and things into his sea of forgetfulness but then I don't agree with people that would say what if you got the new birth everything's taken care of that's only for the soul right well I've always said that and I said stay with it that new birth is only for the soul is not the body and spirit then if we have problems in life we have to straighten them up why would if it's true that your new birth takes care of everything his people want to believe why would it be that Prophet would have to preach marriage and divorce all right why would he be on invisible Union to say if you women said you've done something wrong in your life and said you don't tell your husband he said in 10 years later you tell him he said he has a right to put you away in Mary again that's what he said why would you need that it was a new birth you birth just wipe everybody clean another New Birth just started a process of us being clean and then we get into marriage and divorce into the literal and we look at it and we say well there's any hopes for me only through Christ Jesus but it's like I say go ahead you can go somewhere and find you a church he says you're okay they'll make you deacons preachers and things but we take that stand here and we operate according to you know if a man's been married twice he's not going to be the preacher here he said well people have done that yeah because I had nothing to do with that they started preaching before I come come along I'm saying what I'm dealing with are you saying brother so-and-so's wrong that's none of my business and none of yours that's between so and so and God you get upset at me because you're saying I made my statement right for you to listen I said people have done things and married before they come here to this church I have nothing to do with that but I do have something to do with this church as being pastor and that's why we don't put nobody in office as a deacon that's been married before or the wife being married before you know because we keep that as a rule huh but to do that see that makes it into a situation was sometimes horrible but that's all right I have to take my stand and I've took it and I've made my stand all right what you see there is a Grace of marriage and divorce if you can believe it but you got to accept it and you can only get it from God you can't get it from no man I don't care where you go just because somebody had walked up you think I'm all right brother I'm gonna shake your hand over there you take that handshake cleans you ain't but one way to be clean that's when God can put it in there sea of his forgetfulness in your marital situations can be cleaned because if not that old husband is still alive and you know we're all women in the body of Christ feminist so then our problem was the other situation we're going to deal with now that we all had an old denominational husband whether we ever went to a church or not now don't just don't just get it plain see where we ever went to a church or not we had an old denominational husband and that denominational husband bound Us by things that he explained away and see that's the guy we got to deal with now the new bird sets the soul free the marriage and divorce the grace can set the bodies or whatever you want to call it Spirit body free in that basis but we've got to have something to set us free from that Old husband called denominations I never was in one brother Dale I have you to know well okay it makes you one by yourself foreign started the first organization right she organized in the garden with the devil speaking to her through the Beast and caused us to be like we are that's why brother random we'll call her our adulterous mother Eve that's an invisible Union right or adulterous and you know who we were mad from you say if if I can just prove that I was come from Adam I'm all right that's what they preach in the message if you come from Adam you're capable of being saved but if you come from the Beast you ain't capable of being saved that's the doctrine since I started in the message 40 something years ago when my Bible says in Adam all die so it blames Adam then it says Eve is the mother of all living so she's the mother of all living then what it brought around to say he said we were all born between Satan and Eve he may have used the word devil there and Eve but it's the same old guy we were all born in sin shaping and iniquity espoused where mother's wound so I don't care how pure your lineage is Abel his brother Bob was preaching this morning he made a sacrifice right now if he's so pure why'd you have to make one far and only been Cain the way that everybody's treaches it but you see organized religion has been from the garden and even though the new birth can kill that old nature of being that we are the soul part and God can come in and live and as I told you when it first started kind of known this I said everybody wants to take the new birth and then they want to go to a marriage and divorce go to we get these bodies free we're ready to go well now if you if you followed my lineup the way I believe it you work it first then you can deal with your natural life but there's still that life stage to be dealt with and that's what's killing us is the organizational spirit that dwells through us and if that old husband ain't dead we're still married to organize religion whether you like it or not that's what your Prophet said I've got it in here in invisible Union you read the book you've heard it he said there ain't no denomination can take the word now we I'll say it again over and over we're not against people no difference in them you remember I read you a quote the other day said their church is this the church not your church is a church it's a building you know we may not have the fanciest in the country but we do have a building you know and I'm happy with it but listen that old husband organized religion is what's caused in our problem and I've made the statement before and might as well go ahead and make it now and then you can do what you want to on especially internets and sister thanks see your prophet came through organized religion no no wait a minute no profit I'll agree with you 100 on that well that no Prophet ever come to an organization or from an organization he said I'll agree with you 100 percent because the prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ you can't organize him so then when the prophet seen it he saw in the opening of the seals he said for one time in my life I see why I was against denomination of sometimes why it took the opening of the word for him to realize what was really killing us what did we read while ago Satan explaining it away yeah I'm up here preaching away and you're out there figuring it out well I don't quite agree with all what he said this and I just don't I think it's this way I think it's that way yeah kind of like we had two brothers and a Minister's meeting one time and they were just going at each other so and they were just raising King I finally just stopped him I said holy this to me I said are you saying so and he said yeah you're saying so yeah I said everybody in the building knows you're saying the same thing but you too both of you so stubborn you won't admit if you're saying the same thing all right you see Church that old husband of organized religion is what's holding you and I here now some of you amen back a few Services ago when I brought it around Horeb and said we went around horrible long enough you know talking about the message people in the doctrines of organization that's among the message well I'm not preaching out there I'm preaching here what's wrong with Lula is organizational religion and that husband the prophet said invisible Union has got to be dead right let's see if I can pick that one up he speaks to you've got to be born again to find out all right go to number 11. do the number 11. invisible Union and to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first denominational husband well brother Dale he just using denominations as as a way of explaining the husband oh I'm glad you thought of that because there isn't one of them that can take all the word of God so he's not talking about just some explaining it he's explaining what we are whole makeup is organizational right car dealer right I don't I don't know what uh Richard's selling now but used to sell insurance sister Johnny was in computer with chiltons or something and what it was Aaron is working on down at the University of Georgia everywhere you had is an organization right what is an organization a group of people getting together for a common cause to try to produce a product to sell it that's in the natural right bring that over into spiritual then you'll see why there's so many people in this message that they're following all kind of doctrinal ideas and they'll ask you real quick who do you follow Heaven Help for you to say Samuel Dale because I'll be the first one to tell you you're wrong because you can organize on that and die just as quick doing it that way as you can to believe a two Soul seventh under virtue perusia or polygamy I fought that from the beginning don't do it except what God gives us and thank God for it but don't organize around it don't come to me won't know what kind of cars could you buy I'll tell you a Chevrolet you know why my check comes from there I get a retirement check in General Motors come on Church that old near first denominational husband he's got to be dead to yourself from your first denominational husband because there isn't one of them that can take all the word of God to show me where the one is at oh you say mine the other Feller says he is to put them together put them together and you find out you're both wrong now watch soon as you denominate read revelation 17. now come on watch revelation 17. the old mother and the Harlot daughters right right see if you think your church is this or that just read the Holy he says they're both wrong as soon as you denominate read Revelation 17. you see you've got to be dead from that thing and I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together Across the Nation you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are what lady osia we've got to be birthed out of Lady of SIA into the message of the hour there has never been and never will be a part of the body of Christ that is a denomination he said no wait a minute they had their they had their day but there wasn't no denomination out of it it was not a denomination in the days of Luther Luther was called out to be the people they denominated after he got gone right every organization formed after their leader preached his message then they started as quick as this Prophet went off the scene to organize and denominate this message and like the prophet said you're arguing over whether he's coming on a white horse or on a cloud he said either way he's coming I want to be ready what about a man like that but yet until those seals broke to the prophet he had the white horse rider as the Holy Spirit so he was deceived oh that'll go over good won't it he was deceived by modernization just like John was went on Patmos he admired that church read your Bible read what the prophet has to say he admired the church beautiful situation you look at it across the land out there today there's churches today that are spending all of their day taking up money going to Foreign Fields feeding the poor doing all kind of things right come on are you against that no what am I against then what's killing me and you now if you're listening listen very carefully even the garden organized started to death until we get rid of her problem and her problem wasn't uh a woman that was so sexy that wasn't her problem right what was her problem she wanted to help God now can you see what I was talking about the children of Israel does feel like the Nations around us they wanted to help God something they could do Eve couldn't accept the fact that it's just happy and be in the garden and God would come every day and lay them down at night and put him to sleep and say have you enjoyed today Drew her memory reason conscious affections whatever REM you want to call it through that realms Satan began to interpret explain it laughs and she began to accept his lie was the secondary attribute from that he had to First enter her mind and that's what Paul said lest Satan through his septility like he did even the garden through the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus you come over here in the end time this is the worst age of all ages there's never been age like this organized religion has brought the people together and you and I could sit right here in Lula and do the same thing we can be a two Soul seven Thunder versus whatever you want to call them doctrines we got a choice God gave us Grace now that's what I want to talk about a minute and then we'll just quit he gave us Grace by bringing this message this message is not a book of rules I was talking internet Sunday school class today they asked brother random one day what must we do to be saved he said you know for a lot of people said uh you know he said they asked them during the Bible what can we do but he said to most people today said we'd said quit this and don't do that and don't do that you know cut don't cut your hair no more don't wear them don't paint your face and don't do all this don't drink don't go he said they didn't ask him that they said they asked him how to get born again did we give them a book of rules now come on Church be honest show me a church that don't base things on rules come on well brother now the church got to have rules I agree but if they're organizational rules there's a lot of difference in that in God's word to be plain because you can make an organizational rule out or don't cut your heart don't worry your pants don't paint your face right and you can tell the people that are on the way they but that's not the question what must we do to be saved repeat every one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ organize it that old denominational husband has got to be dead as long as you whole we read to you to man's traditional tradition of denominations you're called in the word God's word adulteress as long as you're a denominational Creed seeking Seeker belonging to a denominational church that denies a word you're an adulteress that's what the Bible said are you down to number 11. burger at 158. back up to 11. 158 I'm right there neither can you buy our sons of God neither came by our godson of his word to this illegitimate denominational group you cannot do it in your incubator you cannot bring forth a word Son of God I am speaking to the church but still you claim to be very religious so was kind The Prostitute of son very religious Bill dollars offered sacrifice paid his tithes and done everything that any other religious man would be would do would he fail to keep the word he failed to have the Revelation go ahead and roll it up and the Revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what is it what is a revelation Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church in the gates of hell can't Prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed Abel by faith offered by Revelation Faith offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain by revelation Revelation is the only thing that's going to let you and I know that we're a denominational Creed seeking bunch of people but brother Dale I want to meet you in the office called I want you to know I don't think no Creeds girl look at number 12. I ended up the other night talking about the eagle look at paragraph 120 128. ends 127 you mean to tell me that an eagle would eat that you couldn't do it no sir neither will a Christian eat on that dead akarians from our old denominational from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour God promises rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal and the full seven course meal for all the Seven Seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive pray for me because on The Minister's meeting I've got to speak on the seventh seal and how can you speak to people about a seventh seal when automatically before we ever start the argument's going to be whether the seal is open or whether it's not you say what causes that preachers explaining away the word see you say well what about them anybody can read the Bible says the seventh seal was opened that's right but you go explain that to the people of this message they'll quote you to death but look at the last one and then we'll get through look as he finishes up the invisible Union and what he's saying paragraph 305 307 I think saying this now this goes across the nation in New York now it's 25 minutes after 11. well Philadelphia around through there your Saints sitting there listening right now in churches all around lay up way down and around Mexico way up around the Canada reading this is to show you where it's all over the world and all around the cross 200 miles anywhere within the North American continent here almost people is added listening right now thousands of thousands listening that's my message to you Church you that's a union that's an organization oh that's an organism right do you Church bride right knew this a union organism spiritual union by the word and that you're dead to these old husbands you're born to new don't try to dig him up he's dead and if you're a born-again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you is word coming on word on word on word on word and coming to full stature of Christ that's right so we can come to get his bride now we're just ready for that one thing that's the coming of the Lord denominations old husbands you go home and you run in organization in your computer you run in denominations and just read I've just picked a few just to make a point organized religion was used even to bring us to Christ Paul calls it a Schoolmaster because of all that but a random cause of denominations a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ all right we've been called out of organized religion right into the message of the hour because that's the only ones that will receive the message of the hour but we've got to have a birth from word upon word upon kind of looks like he's talking about the Statue of perfect man don't it word upon word upon word to set us free from organized religion I said it the first day I was in Gainesville years ago when we left the Baptist I said God's got me out of the Baptist now I want the Baptist out of me organization is man's ideas I tried to make my point about using it as Paul does with the law see there's more laws than just 10 of The Commandments you can't even take the Ten Commandments as a brother was saying this morning and even deal with it as uh our doings because the law was spiritual Paul says it was the word of God what man done with it by explaining it away made to people more lost than there ever were to start with now listen you know how I am and the way I talk I thanked every preacher that's ever helped me when I was back there in the denominations and things we was going through them real fast sometimes one of the last three months we kind of shuffled them around a good bit you know I thanked them all for helping me I had to walk out of two churches in this message I personally thank both of the pastors for helping me I thank God for people that's helped me and wanted to do for me but we didn't realize the danger of everything you see you take those little children and you put them in a Sunday school class and you you say we will sing about Jesus what are you saying they said Trinity father son Oliver what did the denominations teach us they used to tell me as a deacon and if the preacher got off the word I was supposed to go to the pulpit close his Bible dismiss the congregation and we'd put him out of the church I said all I know the Bible said it's supposed to wait on tables I didn't get along then either I was too independent I guess because I told him I said I don't see it in the word you see in the Baptist the deacons run the church that's that's the way it is then you move up to some of these others and they're called other things you know but listen God has led you and I to the truth there is no making fun or lighter or thrown off on anybody that's tried to help us bring it to where we are that's not the way bless God I don't know how to do them an organized religion I've always told you you introduce somebody to the message and they start talking about organized religion being wrong you watch that person 99.9.9 of the time three months later they're gone because they're going to find something wrong where are they coming to but if you get them stationed in the word of the one true and living God the water baptism the things of the Bible of the truth a lot of them will stay what do you give the first thing a church H book right that's the first thing I give to anybody that's a new convert and I don't give these people sitting here to tell you that I worked with them for months before I mentioned brother random was a prophet they asked me where I got it never told them why because it wasn't getting them to just a doctrinal quote just trying to get him to Jesus Christ you go back in your mind and you think it over the people that you know preachers and all they got in the pulpits and screamed and hollered how bad organized religion was and you know yourself most of them are not in the message today if they are they're still preaching about organized religion how bad it is that's all right but you see the more that's being revealed to me the more I find out I'm the guy that Jesus said was standing in the door and wouldn't let the people go in and wouldn't go any South you remember that you know he's talking about preachers preachers standing in the door wouldn't go in and wouldn't let the people go in right he said hold that left it's all back there and Spirits ain't dead I know what I got to preach on the next one you know that brother random said the Holy Ghost is being Bound 2 000 years it's only been 2000 since Calvary so evidently never was loose to what he wanted to be Paul was fighting it he will come back it's what your Prophet says it's been bound for two thousand years at the door of Creeds and you either said dogmas or denominations they got them lay in their home you say well I'm out I'm out well praise God I want him to get me out I like that song about what is it each step I take just leads me closer right come on brothers let's sing that there's no need of trying to preach a whole lot and read a lot of quotes if you don't see what I'm talking about you're in bad shape denominations still have you and I bound limitations well we're not perfect now are you trying to say you're perfect are you trying to say you're the only ones going we will all be good right or I'll be good and just love one another it don't matter what the brother believes or the sister just just love them well I thought we're supposed to do that anyway I thought the Bible spoke of a Christian loving everybody have you ever seen me get upset and mad in front of somebody that was trying to talk to him about the Lord some of these are here that I introduced a message to ask him sister Johnny back there her brother brother dardy he got all mixed up in an old religious cult up at Lula Georgia boy she flew all the way from New York to come down and try to get her brother out of that old denominational cult not trying to say anything but just comparing it you remember Welch Evans and them it was going straight and brought around him out you remember that and when they come down to straighten him out every one of them got converted well sister Johnny comes down to see us all to see what we was she was going to straighten us all out well she said they made a good thing had a good service and good spirit good talkings you know good preaching and what caught her heart not all we talked about not all we could convince are in the Bible of the prophet she'd heard all of that right but there was a little old girl about probably might have been eight years old or something I don't remember exactly it's a little young girl her name was Anna sister Johnny was leaving that day and everybody was telling him bye and she said well that's good called him old folks they know how to be be nice you know they deceive you you know they make you feel like he's being nice to you but when Anna went out there and said sister Johnny we enjoyed having you glad you came and I love you Glad You Came Down ask her what brought God to her it's not all that hoopaloo she said them old folks can deceive you but said them young ones won't they'll tell you like it is is it not that the prophet said a life lived is the best thing for anywhere a life lived wins more people to Jesus Christ than everything else brother I don't like it because you do this or you do that all right you're not the pastor and a sister sit here and played the piano for 17 years with us I'm probably 10 out of that she's smoking I didn't throw her out of the church ain't nobody get on my platform like that that's your church I had would you see church I have to remember where I come from and I can still remember where I come from and that's why I Don't Preach like all these other preachers I only try to preach the word to you because all of this other of lives and things if I can get you born again it'll take care of it you know what in your house you'll be wanted and one day you're looking boy look at that look look at people away how can brother Dale let them women come in here looking like that now folks out there on the internet I mean you Joe you're welcome to turn around and show the people here there's not a bunch of bobbed hired women and shorts wearing and stuff like that we do have rules and regulations they're not rules and regulations they're just the fact that we've had people come here and once they see the ladies here and the way they dress they just start dressing that away it's not to been preached to they just see it it's the organized religions what's killing us an organized religion is that old husband now you want me to finish at this point any thoughts we have let's tie all three messages together one second the new birth marital situations of life are your old denominational husband tied together with one thing the law what is the law brother Dale you've preached on it now for 27 sermons give us your thoughts on what the law is the law is not just the Ten Commandments Paul said the Lord Spirit of Life sent me free law sin and death there's many laws law is man's ideas that he has acquired over time right well the how I was telling the other day when we're up there fishing about a time when a tank was burning Underground well I'm going to run he told everybody else they better leave but he knew one law and that was if he could cut that iron off but he knew by cutting that air off if that thing caused a spark after then it's going to blow up and he is gone but he runs over with a rag and his mother's out to pipe it was burning and he stopped that from happening willing to give his life to save others laws are man's ideas right speed limit this that doing that through and you know what you got to do you're buying homes you got a law you got to go buy a way to buy them you gotta law is man's ideas so they didn't get what they thought they thought they got a buck a bunch of rules you know no they got God in letter form now how can you make that wrong I've never in all of preached in my life tried to make the law wrong I've told you the law is spiritual the man's ideas on the law to interpret it see they didn't listen you want brother Brown's words he said God wrote now he ain't talking about just Ten Commandments he's talking about all of the ordinances and the things that was written in Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy written by Moses he said God wrote Moses interpreted that's why he was Christ to the people God wrote and brother Branham interpreted law is man's ideas the word of God is Not man's idea the word of God is God's word so now you take the Ten Commandments and make them wrong his brother Gary was saying one time about it you read it a little different you know you heard the story of the guy that was overseas and his wife kept writing him you know writing to him and he couldn't read he got somebody else to read it and he's he kept reading her letters every time and she'd say we need money send home money we got bills to pay well you just wouldn't do it and one day he had another guy that letter you know that would you just read that again to me look what she says the man says we're hungry we need something to eat we need food did we need to pay the bills he said I'll tell you what since she's changed her mind I'm going to send her some money let's see if we'd ever take that amount in the word of God and brother Gary my point was Brother Gary said he was here talking about and you read it I shall not kill we'll read it Thou shalt not kill is anything wrong with it Thou shalt not steal oh we want this deep hard Stern boss God help not kill us then he turned around and says go out there and kill all them people and don't even leave babies alive well he looked like he's done broke his own word no but you change it to Thou shalt not kill that's your not steal if you're a Christian you're not going to steal you're a Christian you're not going to kill if you're a Christian you're not going to commit adultery you're not going to lie cheat and steal if you're Christian right there's nothing wrong with the Commandments the Lord not God is one is any problem with that you'll have no other gods before me is any problem with that totally changes what we think the Ten Commandments says to be a book of rules it turns into a revelation of Jesus Christ you know what Jesus was when he walked out there you know that the word the Bible was written by the prophets is that right and you know what he was a fulfillment of that was that laws and rules and regulations or was it a person a lot of things different people think about it but I hope you understand what I've tried to drive down trying to get down to this point but really I should probably spend 20 sermons on this and I may do it because I don't know I just I don't know what I'm going to preach on now I know a few things but my point is one thing You and I by our own understanding is what's taking us to the Grave we have heard the word we've marched around Horeb but it's now time to move on and to see Christ what do we cover let's Stand Together Christ is what we need to see the revealed word each step I take to know that he will die you're right anybody have a need to know that God is a person he's a person he's been explained away to us that he's just a spirit my little sister has a hurting in her back to what you're back Mighty young will be having back trouble all right I want you to do
