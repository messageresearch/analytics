those that are away as parents was announcing Wes up in Tennessee brother de's down at his brother's preaching and brother G's brother Aaron is down at brother Colin's preaching so praise the Lord for that they're out taking the word you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Romans 8 and Romans 10 we got a little visitor back there with us today we always say when you come one time you're visitor you come time two times you're part of us so we've got little Matthew Ace with us and know that to have him with us today and good to see Matt and B but he's a fine little fell and growing like a weed so just keep praying for him he he has a little problem with his um bow movement so just keep praying that everything will be all right and I believe it will I think it'll all be normal and everything will be all right so we just pray that the Lord would bless amen remember the announcements that are made we was brother fory was to be with us this coming Wednesday but he's not going to be with us on Wednesday he's going to be with us the next Sunday which will be you know the 23rd I think it's right and then remember that we will be having brother um Ron Spencer will be with us on the 29th and the 30th so we've got these brothers kind of back to back so just remember these and and all in pray the Lord would bless each one is any other announcements also remember to you that were downstairs uh there will be a chili the annual chili cook off over here to the church beside of us brother uh Buster and them on uh November the 5th so we're going to be having a wedding here and a cook off over there on Chile and they'll have a car show and all so we're going to have to pack up in the area out here to make sure they have enough room and that we have have enough room so we may have to bring the van and carpool people from somewhere parking up to here on for the wedding so just remember that cuz they will have a a big cook off and it'll be on underway during the time that we're having the wedding here so just don't get all excited about it we'll take care of it and park you somewhere else and haul you backwards and forth for the wedding and everything so just you know do it that way amen Romans 8 and Romans 10 amen father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have upon the Earth here we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for you most of all because without you it would not anything be possible whatsoever and we pray that you would just bless and guide each one Lord and just keep us in your love forgive our sins because we want to be covered and led of you and Lord you know our mind is is today kind of Twisted because we changed the service around and things and and all Lord because of it thought you gave us and we just ask you to come on the scene now and be with us and guide us now as we read your word let your love be with us in Jesus name amen got one of those where did I thought I was set schedule to preach two Services I already had them laid out but had to pick up another thought because it came to me this morning and it relates back to the message on Wednesday so we will just do it oh George Danny Wade said don't worry about that get Hope on said me to make sure and give you that word okay Romans 8 we'll go to verse 26 and 27 likewise the spirit also help with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we all but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God now what is the will of God the will of God is his word okay we can read the whole chapter of Romans and and trying to Romans 10 to try to get to the point but let's go uh over and you have it up on verse 10 but we'll read verse 9 but if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness but with a mouth confession is made unto salvation you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I got to thinking about this uh and uh I'll get back to more into the message but I've been a thought's been on my mind about something for quite a while and what I want you to title this is a negative confession all right and I'm asking the question do we have a negative confession or a positive attitude come on that's right now which one is it do we have a negative confession so anything that is not positive all right anything that's not positive positive you understand me would have to be negative cuz there's no middle ground between positive and negative so anything that's not positive is negative but you understand what I'm saying see if it it may sound like it's positive you can say well that's positive you can you can take a car and you can say well we we've we've got a a a car here you know that according to the battery post it's showing that it's uh you know 12 14 volts but if they can be a little bit of a problems maybe uh a dirty uh battery post or whatever see then it it won't transmit over into the car so a lot of times the car won't crank especially this new model stuff now the old models we we trying to get by but this new models takes at least 12 volts to crank so you know you can say well I've got 12 volts on my battery meter here well it may not crank though because you you've got to have enough to get it to go so that's now that's my thought anything that's not positive positive will fall in the line of negativism all right so as everybody got the point now we'll try to get to the the point we're talking about all right because as we were we're trying to cover Wednesday I see another little buddy back there I don't know where he's been with us before or not but we say to him welcome and just be part of us too there was Sister Barbara all right now we speaking about this past Wednesday of what is death what is death right all right we found the best definition for or I did the best definition we can that I can find for death it's not going down to the Undertaker and seeing somebody Dead all right you know that's what we call death somebody dies we call that death but remember death was in the garden before Cain killed Abel all right death is what caused the problem that's what I trying to get across Wednesday see death in the garden caused a problem death is still facing you and I amen dying is naturally facing us all right you know dying going by the grave because of the death that's was in the garden and is stilling you and I no brother Dale I'm a Christian uh you know I'm a Christian and and all like that I I I'm a you know I've been a Christian in a long time well that's true but Paul said the life the enemy to be destroyed was death all right now is he talking about the life the enemy to be destroyed is dying that's part of it but see the real enemy that's facing you and I is the carnality of the mind because that's what happened in the garden it said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman all right now enmity is carnality all right so just translate that I'll put carnality I I'll give you a carnal mind and Paul said the carnal mind was that enmity amen division right we don't we don't need the carnal mind that's right and we have enough of that cuz that's where we live right the prophet of God would even State he said the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith all right now hold on to it and it can become spiritual Revelation that's right but take any thought into it contrary to the truth it becomes a negative confession that's right no matter how positive you think you are amen and that's what I I try to tell you and I'm not throwing off on anybody we'll get into some things here but you see people that come up and they'll say uh you got cancer well then they they they'll go along a little while and they build up a faith like within them and they start saying you know I'm Healed I'm Healed I believe I'm Healed and as long as they're feeling good their confession is I'm Healed all right but then when it comes to the basis they begin to feel bad see then you see them weakening on their confession when it's really that's when you're supposed to keep saying I'm Healed because the prophet said you know that's the greatest sign that you're healed is for you to get sicker because your body is purifying the the situation you know it's having to pump blood it's having to do things uh your white blood count runs up and and it's fighting against all of the uh of the the enemies that's in the body but instead of that we start weakening down then after a while we say well well you know the doctor says I got cancer and I guess I do but then you're weakening down right so You' turned from a positive attitude or confession to a negative point right all right see why not just to start with say the doctor says I got cancer but I say by Stripes I'm Healed and then just keep confessing it now we're going to read the minute where the Prophet said say it out loud all right now we read in Romans get the point what I'm saying now we'll move on that death then is to reject the revealed word we something revealed to you and you go do it right you're dead that's right that's right like I told you about the man that that told me and said the Lord spoke to him get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well he got a Methodist fell to baptize him and he baptized him both ways he said I said before you say anything I'm going to tell you how you got baptized and I Wouldn't Die you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then you got baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost see I done it both ways I said no you erased it you erased your baptism CU you didn't believe that's right well see that that was then you can say well the Lord spoke I believe the Lord spoke to the man no argument but when he brought it over see he thought that satisfied the point and I said no sir I said the problem would have been you know if you have went and done to Father Son and Holy Ghost and then the Lord Jesus Christ might have been a different thing but you see water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and won't go do it then until you get that out of the way you're dying that's right now that's you know I'm just I'm not I didn't know who's going to be here or what's going to be and so you just take it for whatever now I'm just I try to preach whatever to to everybody that I can but this thought came to me that what we have is the biggest portion is a negative confession right now does everybody understand what I mean yes let me let me say it over again now negative is anything less of positive there is not a area gray we call it gray area between negative and positive because the the battery won't work if you don't have the right amount of juice it won't work it can be positive up to the certain point right is we'll get to it in a minute the prophet says keep saying it over and over amen that's right you know have you ever done that I've got these little things on the back of my neck they call glands and you know I go to the doctor and he looks at them he says they're not growing any I said okay fine no problem but you know every time I reach back there and wash or anything I said by Stripes I'm heal you say you do it every time every time I think of it I sure do it why because I'm going to say what he says because I'm a liar see you say no no no here's where we are now now brother if I say that I'm Healed and I'm not healed I'm a liar that's what I'm exactly say now listen what I'm getting there you say I'm a liar now you born one right you automatically one am amen anything contrary to positive is a lie now you're following me there's no no gray area in this time amen it's either positive or negative amen all right right now let's keep confessing till it comes you say I don't want to lie about being that I'm sick and I don't want to lie about it why are you lying when you say what God says God says you're healed am you're lying if you don't say What God Says are you following me but see anything now that we see and we reject that then we turn ourselves into death right it doesn't make no difference about what what it is or what cost it is there is no cost cuz God paid the price amen I'm just being blunt now and straight because see this was the the message I received and I didn't get it till this morning so I had to rewrite the notes and had a problem we did back in the back trying to get everything together to where I could change the message all right so now we get to Point anything to return down anything turnning down the revealed word it turns out to be death okay now and we read in Romans here that he makes intercession Upon Our confession amen now the Bible says as we read there believe in your heart right right confess with your mouth now leave either one of them off what have you done negative confession right so you're negative if you leave either one of them all you say well I believe in my heart well if you confess with your mouth well I done it secretly you know like say well I think I receive the Holy Ghost I don't want nobody to know it you know I'm keep no no it's like trying to put out a fire on a windy day and that's pretty hard to do all right but get what I'm saying now we first must confess the Lord Jesus Christ and believe in our heart that he saved us that's what brings us to Salvation amen all right now here's where the problem is we come through and we we start making our confession and we we confess that we're saved we confess that we're healed all right then things changes a little bit you know maybe having no problems and all at once you start having troubles and you start saying well well I I I wonder you know maybe I didn't get saved well you know what God's got to say what you say that's right now you following me this thing is not that God's going to override your confession right he's not going to ride your free moral agency right so whatever we say let's keep saying it amen it don't make no difference how sick we get keep saying it right I walk in the office the doctor there years ago you know and he done his test and said I'm going to take your kneecap off well I went in hurting I come out hurting I've seen many a day that I would have I would have loved to let them ride with somebody something that's why I started this riding by myself God I'd be riding with other people you know be cramped up in the back seat I seen a many a day I'd love to walk 10 miles because my knees was killing me I wanted to get out and walk you know all right but you see when I went in the doctor said okay Sam proved it X-rays and all of it this is an orthopedic surgeon and he said we just have to take your kneecaps off at least that one I just looked at him and grinned I said you a taking my knap off he look back and gmed I like him really you know when he come in there he come in there with eating scrubs on the what you know what he come in Old par of ragged and clothes he was my style of a guy you know pain all over his shoes and pants and nothing like he been in there painting he was my kind of guy he just looked at and GRE he said well Sam we'll take them off I said you'll never take them off well I still got him that's probably about 30 something years ago and you know what I didn't instantly get healed you know what I'm saying delivered from the pain the problems and but I had made my confession now what if I had got home and I went back to another doctor because he wouldn't sign me out from work most of you know story so I had to go back to my family doctor to get him to sign me out a couple of days from work and he said Sam that gu knows what he's talking about he's a he's a professional you know he he he's a higher than I am and I said but listen I got irritated kneecap get me off my feet for a few days he said I'll give you two days he said I can't give you any more cuz if you got crippling arthritis like he says he said you sit down you'll lock up I have enough sense to realize that but I had enough sense to know too I was confessing God had healed me will you know what God healed me thank and lay up in the hospital down there with my back just to killing me and the doctor I finally begged him to let me off cuz we were scheduled Services here Friday Saturday and Sunday and uh but Mo was I I don't remember who come preach but anyhow the doctor he said if you'll go home and go to bed I'll let you go well I guess I kind of halfway lied to him I said I'll try to do what you say I went home got a heating pad come sat down in the Pew sat there Friday Saturday and Sunday you know what God heal me I'm trying to get you to see folks that's the point of what I want us to talk about we can take a negative confession and we can go right on doing what we're doing it's not no problem for you to say what the doctor says right right that's right well I'm honest that's where my wife she gets on to me all the time ain't no need going down there to the doctor where you talk I said well I talk plain go into the doctor's office and say he says what do you need Sam I said by I'm I'm I'm doing wonderful doctor so I finally changed the way of saying it I go in and say look everything's oky dokie except this coal I got all right so I guess I broke down to say it like it is maybe but you know like she says ain't going need to go if you're going to tell them you're okay well that's true so they when they look at me and it's green I go in and the the cancer doctor he walks in he's used to seeing all them patients is out there you know and the nurse she she lies herself to death that me because when I go in and she'll run up all this you know I said am I still living she said well according to all the signs you are so we just have a good time you know laughing and talking the doctor come in how you doing I'm doing wonderful and I told you Wednesday night about how that the the blood count from what they say I've got leukemia you know that's their business that's their machines but it went down it was on 22 and it went to 40 and it started back down now it's on 14 Hallelujah that's only four points above normal for keep saying you heal don't take nothing contrary to it hey if you're sick take an aspirin come on go to to the doctor that's right you answer no I'm not hurting yeah you are yeah I am go on do what the doctor says as long as you're not contrary to the word of God all right just get off of that try to get on what I'm talk about but see he makes confession upon he makes intercession Upon Our confession all right now as long as our confession is right I was looking because I had to change this but R actually made a statement one time he said you're saved as long as you confess you're saved but he said you quit saying you're saved and you're lost oh that don't people don't like to swallow that one right but get what he's talking about that's it justification and sanctification you can be saved and then you can be lost according to your confession but once that baptism the Holy Ghost comes now right it's him confessing you're saved that's right it's not you saying it anymore all right so then he couldn't be talking about a born again Christian to be lost that's what we trying to get across Sunday about I mean Wednesday about death brother R said man fell from eternal life to death now how can you fall from eternal life to death they fell from eternal life to where they would went on to be made Eternal in Body Spirit soul and everything to death and went to the grave and that's what I told you you might not have liked it but I said we are in the same shape right now right we're in the same position they were in in the garden all right because you and I even though we're born again we can't lose eternal life no in the soul but we can go by the grave cuz that's our confession so let's start confessing what we are why can't we cuz he makes intercession Upon Our confession yes see if we don't confess it how can we expect God to do it right well I think I'm heal well that's all he can say I think you are right come on that's all he can say he saids whatever you think I'll confess it but see we're supposed to believe in the heart and then confess with our mouth so we believe in the heart and say what the doctor says with our mouth right come on we go to the doctors we're not against going to the doctors we're not against any kind of doing but when you're built on what the doctor says instead of what God says you're in unbelief I don't care who you are and what you're talking about you're an unbelief cuz the doctor he he just practicing amen all right but God is done and finished When God says we're healed that's finished amen all we got to do is say what he says and for me not to say what he says I'm a liar that's right don't ride on no tombstone that that that brother Dale died of so and so right on there he died saying he's healed amen is because I believe it let me confess it until it can take place cuz if I don't confess it what can do what can he make intercession upon right how can he make intercession upon anything that we don't confess but see we take a negative approach and that's why we're dying now come on I believe the message is here now down Through the Ages and time man confess the best they could do yes right yes but there wasn't enough that's what I wanted to preach this morning was that part of the message I'll get back to it see they wanted to confess it and they confess the best they could do right right Luther said I have eternal life he sa I just choose Luther cuz everybody argued and say they didn't have this I differ we totally Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is eternal life Wesley had it you know the people of that day and they were part of the body of Jesus Christ but they could not come to the change of the body why because now listen first off God had not brought the message right right right and that now listen don't you think Luther said by his stripes I'm Healed don't you think Luther said I'm Healed don't you think he said I'm saved don't you said don't you think that he read and probably preached that we' be changed in a moment in the twinkle of the ey come on don't you think that he probably preached about the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of an archangel Trump he preached those things yes but what was it it was partial realization right right cuz they couldn't understand how that would take place when we're not in those days right if we're not if this is not the message we better find one right come on we're getting old you know what I mean we we've all set stood here and talked about and turned gray-headed right brother colie and turned loose headed some of us is coming out but you know there's got to be somewhere right that's true amen that somebody is going to start saying it that's right right amen and if we don't say it God can't bring it to P amen all right now so follow what I'm talking about now let's pull up number one Brothers e14 as I was with Moses look what he says let him that's weak say I'm strong watch you see just say in your heart I am now strong I have accepted Jesus Christ as my healer yes and never have a negative testimony anymore amen just believe it God is under obligation our Christ is sitting at the right hand of the father to accept you for he setting there the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for it's your confession that he done all right confess it let the weak say I'm strong am you know what is our problems we think we're so educated revelated until we've lost the Simplicity of life that's right maybe I don't know how to say that but you take these guys that are what's known today called Faith healers and things like that we know they come off of the prophet's message but of healing but you know they're doing a good job and they get people to confess and they're healed and as we say how many times in here do we say I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed you know get caught up in the spirit of it but we sure get caught up in all of the world can't we that's right yeah we come to church I'm problem well that's right we all have problem we're hurting right we're human beings that's no problem we saying what's you're wrong with you right but when that's all we can say well that's all we can talk about that's right is what we say like I said now when we get to and you go down the stairs before we hit the bottom of the steps 75% of he was going to start talking about what the doctor said or the world says or something say I know that cuz you're human you're going to do it how you feeling I ain't feeling too good what don't you say praise the Lord I feel good I'm hurting I'm dying with P Glory Hallelujah I'm still alive sister Johnny said you st ain't down yet she used it a little bit different she said God woke me up this morning morning but you know B Church what are we talking about look the next one accepting God's Gift E9 Now read this real careful with me now healing is not are you reading it now something that you just say now read the whole thing but keep in mind what he's saying this is not the power of positive thinking right right where the little kid went down you know thought his mama was dead there's no power of positive thinking well yeah I believe it I believe it now that's all right if that's the best you can do listen to it just Mally or just say well I yes I I see it I believe that I accept it then if you accept it on those basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until actually you believe it amen and when you believe it then it's going to take place amen but now stop confessing it what is it that's not a point right now don't have a negative testimony we read every time when you confess well I still feel bad today I guess you go right straight back in the same rut that you was in in the beginning right that's right now read it you say this is what the prophet said we we depend upon it well then here are simple things the what he says don't have a negative at testimony every time you confess well I feel bad today I guess you go right straight back in the same rut that you was in in the beginning there's not a man or a woman in here that is baptized with the Holy Ghost but what would start your confession I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me they said you wouldn't do that I believe you'll go right down you will never you're not going to say you're lost right that's right right you're not going to say you're lost right well why can't we say the same thing about healing amen but you'll confess yourself totally out of your healing now now here's what I I get and I I I look at and I know sometimes God let people go through things to where that they can have a testimony well you you that have been here for any time at all you know the testimony this man has been that I've been sick in many ways and you prayed for me and thank God for that but you seen me walk through them with the same confession and the same attitude I am I'm Healed thank God for the doctors and what they can do but I'm Healed right now you got to admit that I'm not a preacher that stood up before you said well brother collie you feel well I'm feeling pretty bad too you know I just we just all feeling pretty bad you know we just all down and out we all just next just none of us ain't got nothing you know and you never heard that out of these lips that's right you've heard me confess it so you can't say people out there on the internet can't can't do it but there's one thing about it there's the people sitting in the congregation if there's anybody can get up and say that brother Dell has ever been down and out negative you have the right to do it right now so they they can hear it on internet you know I've been sick you know I've been through all kind of things but you know that I've been healed too you know my blood type has totally been changed from a neg a positive to a negative medically proven and that's impossible my eyesight was healed that I went 8 years and did not have to wear glasses I do not have to wear them now except for fine reading as far as reading this I can read it off this page so then don't think well now he's just up there you know telling us what we need to have CU he's now you see a lot of people do that a lot of people preach healing but they're the worst ones about going to the doctor that's ever been now I'm just plain okay always down and out at the mouth about something this man not down and out at the mouth right I've always tried to have a positive attitude because I'm going to preach positive you I need to be positive myself all right and not have a negative point about it look at the next one which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever E1 just the part you read what we got underlined and you can go let your testimony be positive every time you get sick and you were prayed for you go out and get a little sick you say well I guess I lost my healing then your testimony becomes negative and Jesus can't say no more for you he's the high priest of your confession sitting there making intercession on your confession what you believe right so you say well I guess I'm sick come on there nothing wrong saying you're sick the wrong long as where you take the wrong attitude about it and you confess what the doctor says that's right instead of what God says right come on look the next one blind B e44 your faith when you set in a meeting like this where the great powers and miracles of god was being done and the Holy Spirit moving the gospel being preached how are you going to stand on a negative confession now how you going to stand on if you word the word pre don't you want don't you want him to stand for you when I see those gates open you under and I see that every Sinner's got to go and Jesus sits right there in the road pleading for us not to go why don't we say what God says that's right when are we going to say what God says yeah skip the next one because it's a very long one but any of you wants it you can have it go down to number six brother confirmation of the commission and there he is the high priest to make intercession Upon Our confession when we accept his word believe it in our heart receive it in there and don't take back but believe exactly it's going to happen the true s of Seed of Abraham will hold on to that word word no matter how long it takes he will bring it to pass there's not a wave in in it nowhere he will bring it to P that's right make an intercession Upon Our confession not a negative attitude look at the next one have not I sent thee 1962 124 e136 you got to believe it because see you can't make the word contradict itself it's got to run perfect just like them blocks and things it's got to run perfect one dove tailing with the other and you lap them over see you can't do it so Christ is perfect so his word's perfect now he's the high priest to make intercession Upon Our confession we confess of anything that he did for us he's there before the father to make it right let the redeemed say so let the redeemed say so listen let me get the last one let's just go to it perseverance number number eight brother let's go to it just now we find it find today it's so much on decisions you hear that all the time making decisions they what to do that's my brother R said Billy Graham said he goes in said he makes an all Rec call said he he goes to a meeting he said I had 30,000 here converts during this healing campaign I mean the the the uh Salvation campaign he said come back to year and don't have one or two maybe it's decisions why cuz you say you're healed you say you're sick you say you're you're delivered you say you're saved but then when things start going wrong I like what brother Gary's Daddy back there was a a doctor he was my kind of doctor because I like what he said first off he said we pray before we operate you know but he said if you can get to people said the first let's see I may misquoted this to her but he said if they told him in in college where he went to the medical school said if you can get the people to believe believe that they're you know they're healed of what are going on or medicine's okay for them something to that degree he said as long as you don't hinder them right said 80% of them will get well something like that maybe 50% or something say they'll get well all right brother said 85 so then he they told him out in the school right if you don't hinder him that's right they're going to get well huh well see then why can't we confess it praise the Lord yes decisions decisions he said decisions are confessions confessions are Stones what does good does it do to to pile up a bunch of stones if you haven't got a stone cutter who can shape them by the sharp two-edged sword of God into Sons and Daughters of God let them run around here with all kind of women dressed like a skin down Wier and call them Christians and Men letting them do it and then call themselves Servants of Christ the Church of lukewarm formal condition and all like that denying the power of God all right what we need is stones and somebody to cut them well like I said you can think what you want to about me as far as what I'm saying but I'm not one that's up here preaching to you about something that I haven't seen come to pass when I say God has healed I've experienced it right when I say God is saved I've experienced it I can talk about it right and I've preached it for 40 years now the people think you come along we got to have some kind of a positive attitude Brother D I agree if you haven't had one but my attitude ever since I come in this message has been very positive and I def gave you the definition of positive when I started anything less of positive is negative I've never had a negative confession about this message it's always been this message is right right amen whether or not I Know It Believe it or can produce it has nothing to do with it that's right because I know now since we know the message is right and listen to what I'm saying now we know the Bible is right we had misconceptions of the Bible right trinitarianism Eternal hells and all of that God we had all kind of except conceptions you know thoughts about it that it said there was three gods and and all these other things water baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost you see now we ought to be able to get to realize that those things was not right that was our ideas this message see has to be the same way our confessions must be right right let me confess it no matter what that's right whether I can produce it or not doesn't have anything to do with cuz see that's what people do they say let's see you produce it and I know you're not going to like this statement but I just stood here and testified of the many things that God has done in this old human body as to be healed of many different things that you witnessed it as a congregation you witnessed that so I'm not out here running my mouth amen that's right I'm not talking about what God can do I'm talking about what God has done looking at you and seeing many of you knowing that and seeing you come through many things right right see you face cancer and things and see you come through it right and sitting here knowing that there's somewhere around close to a 100 of us and nobody's unemployed right now that's a miracle that's right that how we're all from all different ways of the world you know as far as the distances and things and different different situations but yet we're still have our job amen we pray for somebody to get a job you know when they get a job Jesus amen we pray for healing and people are healed just because God don't come and instantly do things then we begin to doubt what he's doing we begin to question him about things I'm talking about me now begin to say why Lord come on I'm human just like you we need rain right now desperately need rain well let's start saying it's going to rain and believe it you don't have to beg God for anything right that's our problem see then we we get into what we think is some form of you remember like brother brand said that when he first you know come trying to come to the Lord said he he seen people pray this way people pray that way and he said I tried every one of them he said I found out that wasn't what it was you know you don't have to beg God for nothing or plead with him just take him at his word right and stand on his word and believe it I always asked a question back some time ago said do you believe that we have the faith of the fathers I said yes didn't back off in the statement and don't back off today right yes later in a discussion I said I will go further than that I'll say we have the headstone bless amen now that doesn't mean everybody's got it if you understand what I'm saying that doesn't mean everybody in the building's got what I'm confessing right that's right it's just what I'm confessing cuz if you don't know what I'm talking about just it's hard for have what you you know have something that you don't know what I'm talking about I'm not saying everybody in the building's got the faith of the fathers I've never said that but I believe the faith of the fathers is hearing right well I just don't see it open your eyes amen what do you need I challenge you you do it all right I don't don't need a challengeing it's just let out in plain truth take the book of Acts which was about 30 years it lasted at least up to the church age of of 853 so that would make somewhere close to at least 20 years and you write down how many healings was done now listen I'm not blind I know the Bible of what it say if the things that were done were written the books couldn't contain it I know that come on but I'm just putting it out in plain language in the book of Acts you take the amount of healings that's done in the book of Acts and you lay them down in this church and see what's taking place we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick healed I've seen everything except blinded eyes open it's on proof dead raised we don't have to argue we're not arguing with nobody cuz it ain't going to change nobody anybody out there on the internet ain't going to change you one bit for you to listen to what we talking about cuz I ain't talking about what's here I'm talking about what's in this around the world to the Bride of Jesus Christ as you'll believe right amen it's here for us if we'll accept it but if we don't start confessing it how can we have it now you tell me the answer to that one well when I see the signs and wonders I believe it you're an unbeliever and you always will be cuz it'll never come to that cuz you'd be looking at the book of Acts and saying the same thing God don't play he's healed and delivered and and guided us through the word amen but if we make a negative confession out of it I believe the faith of the fathers is here for the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe the headstone is here I believe the change is here amen I believe the Rapture is here Amen Let me at least say it cuz if not I'm negative right anything outside of positive well now one of the one day the Holy Ghost fell and they said this is that you know I'm glad you thought of that cuz what you're thinking is it took place right there now the man that said this is that wasn't the one that's right Peter was quoting right from Isaiah amen now what if Isaiah had not said words don't go back or I look for this is that come on Isaiah prophesied that one day and and uh Joel I'll pour out my spirit right that's right was a prophecy saying this is that he looked at it from where he saw it to him it was already there that's right that's the way a prophet saw things to him it was real when non saw chariots joshing in the street he saw Buick and O mobile running together running like lightning with headlights on he saw that but he couldn't go back and tell them Buicks and old mobiles he didn't know what the word was so he said chariot josin in the streets but when he saw that he said it you know what it could not have taken place in the book of Acts had not Jo Isaiah those prophets spoke of it before it came when are we going to start getting that positive about it when we going to get out of our negative confessions right well when I see I believe it believing is see it no it's not right Satan can impersonate what you can see that's right so don't go that route right let me say it's here and get out of my negative confession let me stay I'm Healed no matter what I've got to do let me say I'm saved this is what I said a moment ago we did it badly with healing but we we're we're more positive about our salvation and how can you be more positive about your salvation you can you heal it when both of them the same atonement amen come on both of them the same atonement sir when our transgression BR very NE try some heal same atonement you know what's wrong with us we won't say What God Says on we want to say what we want to say if we can see it well we'll we'll talk about it we'll tell you what you know but sometimes put it on the line put your own experience on the line right and say what God says it says by his stripes we are already done finished healed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are already sealed in the body of Christ amen when I told you it's 30 something or 30 over 30 years ago I stood right here and I said I'm I'm telling you what I see that the biggest portion of the people of this message are going to die and go by the grave and I said I may be one of them but I'm just telling you what the Lord showed me because the people cannot stand on this what the word says they got to have some feeling idea or emotions or thoughts let me say it we're God can bring it to pass yes Lord but then if my life don't live up and back up what I've said then what I said is a blabbering mouth and not a confession from the heart I heard that preached in the Baptist so long until I used to I didn't even like to read Romans 8 through1 why because it said like the prophet was saying he said not what you just say but he said if that's all you you got we read that a minute ago he said keep saying that till it comes right right biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith right speak it until it becomes spiritual Revelation say it amen that's why how many of you go to a doctor's place and tell them say you ain't taking my need help he just life and said I will I just laugh and said you won't and it's not always instant I walked in one day i' got where that I couldn't even shoot a gun with iron sights I had to go to a scope that was the purpose of going to cuz I couldn't see the sights they fuzzed between the two you know it just blurred up and I'd look out you under and it would just wave like that and just distance w eyes I was getting where I couldn't see good had to turn a had I don't know what was wrong with my eyes I I ain't doctor anyway but I had to turn a a book to read it I had to turn it sideways and kind of lean it right and then I could read I don't know what the difference was but I walked in the doctor's office I changed doctors eye doctors went to a different one walked into his office and he run the test and he looked at me he said what are you doing with the glasses in your pocket I said well doctor so and so gave him to me and I've been having trouble all these years and I can't read without it he said well you got 2020 you know what that second I had 2020 that was an instant one I walked out of that doctor's office and it so beautiful to be able to see Terrence was the only one that had better eyesight he used he used to he had what is it 1020 or something we' read signs going down the highway to see who could see them The Furs and tell clearity of it you know read them he could beat me on it but you see I went 8 years today I can still see I chunk I just need a little glasses to help me read you know make things out right why because I believed it my blood pressure was running 180 over 110 170 180 to 110 GLE Motors I kept up with it for quite a while I went to the doctor before I went I came here and I said you pray that when I get there everything will be all right but when I got there and they was doing a physical and that nurse run that blood pressure thing up and she looked at me and she said my Lord what a blood pressure you know what I was expecting maybe 210 over 150 I'm like come on I but I had said God had healed me she run it up she just 120 over 80 I looked at her I said would you believe Friday I was on Monday I said would you believe Friday it was 170 over 110 she said no and doctor got through and come in to tell me about my physical cuz i' went to a new doctor he told me about my physical and he said wonderful blood pressure I said Doctor would you believe Friday that and for a long time it's been running 150 170 like that over 10010 he said no I went outside and I told my wife I said get me another doctor I will not go back to an unbeliever i good I ain't going to it I asked him are you a Christian or are you a Believer I only one I didn't answer that cancer doctor I looked right straight at him when he came in I said you can do what you want to doctor but I'm not taking your chemo he said well I got good news for you you don't have to Lord he said you got the kind you'll die with not die of I said I don't give a hoot what I've got I'm just only going to go so far why can't we have a positive attitude why can't we say God has healed us why can't we say God is has saved us why can't we say God has is here in the faith of the fathers why can't we say God is here in The Headstone why can't we say that the Bible has been fulfilled in this day we're living amen why can't we say the Rapture is already in process oh and I don't mean coming from 40 years ago that's where everybody wants to put it they wants to put it back there something coming why can't we say we're already changed and let God take it to P you know make it come to pass cuz he makes intercession Upon Our confession if we don't say it he can't do it now brother D you saying God that's no I'm just saying his Bible says it and if his Bible tells me that then that's what he said all right I'm not arguing with God nobody I'm just telling you the Bible says it if the Bible says it then that's what God said he said he made intercession Upon Our confession man believes in his heart confess with his mouth right but when are we going to start doing as I emphasized while AG go when are we going to start saying out loud I am healed you remember the man that was blind sitting in the barber's chair and for weeks he had been right on the street corner selling paper saying and he said I can see by Stripes I'm Healed you come in Old Barbara was cutting his high and doing said you know making light of him you know I heard you said just healed he said yes I am and I ain't seen about that time his eyes open he goes running out of the barber shop see our problem is we won't confess what God has said righten so don't ask me brother Dale do you think that we have this do we have that I'm going to say yes now brother Dale can you produce it that's a different thing right cuz I might not be talking about me but somebody has it right then why don't we just keep saying brother here one time wanted us to take a sister to up to a certain brother in the message CU he had heard about his doings and I told a brother I said if you want to go I'll pay your way and take you and your wife up there if that's what you want amen I said but when I get through and the man prays for her we're going to believe she's healed but man better not ask me do I believe what he says you know his doctor cuz I tell him right in front of the person being healed that I don't believe your Doctrine cuz it's not the word the brother told me he said there's no need to go in there same God is here if the same God is here why can't we believe the same God is here oh if brother Brandon was here to tell us so you see what everybody is waiting them that's right and I've never argued with anybody about the tent visions and the things I've told you what I said there's 30 40 days after the resurrection we going to sit around and look at each other oh the dead ra brother Marlo no we going to be shou and Glory Hallelujah because we're going to know it's a reality and brother random can preach 30 40 days to us that's right but he's coming out of the ground because somebody says he's coming he's coming out because somebody confesses it cuz Hebrews 11:40 says they without us cannot be made they can't be complete without you and I when are we going to start saying that and get away from our negative ISM get away from our little thoughts and ideas of this say What God Says keep say it until God brings it to eyes then everybody can see it I mean everybody sees me I still got my kneecaps you know everybody can see me my blood type is totally changing I gave gallon pins at G Motors under a positive I can prove it medically and gainful on their own records and prove it at General Motors and I gave gallons of blood cuz that's a good way to get off the line not have to work came my 6 weeks and we gave find of blood go eat the cookies and drank the juice and set up there oh Lord all right but now say nak the story is about an to read you know or she would be born correctly but listen church when are we going to start being positive about things I'm going to make this statement you can life do what you want to whatever I I'd rather to be positive about something that's totally not right did you understand what I said something ain't even right I'd rather be positive about it I was positive when I believed in the Trinity what was you at least I thought I was come on brother think on these things negative confession is killing us it's taking us to the ground right it's is destroying us but how many of us now will admit to this last statement that when we was Mist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal Etc whatever and we believed in the Trinity we thought we positive didn't we right right we thought we're positive but we couldn't be positive on the word but you know we had probably a positive attitude maybe a better attitude than we have now let us say what God says let's Stand Together 113 fire 113 fire anybody has a need the altar is open if the world from you
