better sorry just those of you from tennessee sorry that's just where you live it's on who you know it's on where you live so now we're going we're going to talk about grace again and i was thinking about this this morning or this afternoon yesterday afternoon and this morning when i talked when i tell you that you know grace is the only thing the only man cannot develop grace god was the only one that could develop this thing called grace because as we've been talking about the eternal redemption are you catching it that's grace and it was put before there was even a person on the earth to sin grace was already there and i'm going to read you if we get down far enough we don't we'll continue on where paul says says do we in other words are we going to sin that grace may abound no god forbid that grace has come to take away our sin not for sins forward but for the sins that we did in the past like brother branham was talking about here on the on the tape this morning about how that that throne of grace if you're born again that throne of grace is inside your heart and every time you do sin as a sinner with human we sin it takes that away if you quickly say god forgive me then it's completely wiped out now see that's grace that's not us because we we as human beings hold grudges we don't forget you can say you do but you don't amen you be honest with yourself no you do not forget what either somebody did to you or what you did or what something went on you do not forget it but god thank god he's the one that will forget it so he forgets if you're born again if you have that holy of holies inside of you because what did the holy of holies do and i'll read to you here in just a minute did you ever realize that there's 185 scriptures that talk about grace and only about 30 of them are in the old testament because it was not unless it was the grace of god himself there was no grace in the old testament it was the law you worked on sunday you you know they had they killed the guy for picking up sticks on sunday they did this if you don't do this if you committed adultery you you didn't go to a court of law you were stoned you and the person you committed it with there was no grace there but now still grace was there for remember grace didn't develop in the old testament grace developed before the foundation of the world right that way it did cover david when he committed adultery and had his best friend killed it did cover rahab because she was a harlot in her old past life and all the different ones ruth being a moabitis and all the different ones that we read and we're going to read them again but we do see grace when you look at adam when god came down in the garden of eden that was grave because adam should have died for what he did eve should have died for what she did but there was grace there and it was grace that was developed before the foundation of the world but now remember you can't have grace that's why this that's why this grace great subject that we're discussing between brother dale and all the ministers myself talking about foreknowledge because without foreknowledge god was a judge and he couldn't be a righteous judge it just this is the way it was amen that's why the prophet of god had to come and give us a grace of marriage and divorce because there was a grace there but remember it don't go over into greasy grace he can't override his word his word says all right so you've got to find grace or unmerited let's look at the at the hebrew lexicon grace is favor and then we're not going to talk about the charming part because that's when you say well somebody walks gracefully or they talk gracefully that has really nothing to do with god that's grace for man on the earth but now see favor and then we're going to look and see that the prophet of god tells us unmerited favor in other words like i just said it's all in who you know well if somebody gets you a job you think you owe that person and you do owe them a little bit of gratitude somebody does something but now not with god god saved you whether you liked him or not but he knew by foreign knowledge that when he presented this to you this grace that you would accept it because see to me grace is the same as the pardon the pardon was extended to the man that killed the guy the grace was or the pardon was extended to the man listen he shot the guy he was a murderer in under the law he was a murderer but now remember what happened he had somebody go and appeal his case like christ appeals our case and then we see that we're going to get into this part where brother brown talks about the real you didn't do it to start with that's what god's looking at he's not looking at the old you he's looking at the new you that he saw before the foundation world that never sinned a day in your life that way you can't stand in judgment you've already stood judgment because when christ was judged you were judged and see that's why in the old testament there's not so much the word grace in the old testament it's a hundred and something scriptures in the new testament because when christ came he brought he was grace he didn't bring grace he was the grace of god because remember everybody thought as brother branham thought that jehovah hated me because it's do's and don'ts and i'm gonna kill you with a firebolt and you know i'm gonna open up the ground and if you don't do this i'm gonna right and then he says now but i thought jesus of the new testament loved me he said come to find out they're the same person but what happened from jehovah of the old to jesus of the new he became flesh he was born like me and you he was now your kinsman his body was judged now saul wasn't judged but his body was judged he gave his soul a ransom though and truly he did christ did go into the holy of holies for me and you and took our judgment he didn't take his judgment he took our judgment so he said whatever they got like boaz he stands up and he says now whatever they've done it doesn't matter i'm taking my shoe off and i'm going to redeem naomi and that's going to restore back everything that she lost when her husband died amen that's what christ did he stood he took calvary and he said i'll take whatever they got right place it on me and that's why that we see this great grace only comes through christ being the son of man our grace now there was grace for every need you know the song there's grace forever need but the grace me and you needed was somebody to come down here in human flesh according to john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so he brought grace to the human being by coming on earth and then we can look at the next one says unmerited divine assistance unmerited divine assistance giving to humans see an animal doesn't need grace it didn't fall it's part of the fallen right but it didn't fall man fell and man being here man being the headstone of the human race when he fell though everything below him fell that's why romans 8 says the whole world is groaning and waiting what for us to get right back up to where adam was to be a ruler of this world but what had to happen is the headstone of all had to come to do that because remember the headstone was rejected it became the chief cornerstone which started grace on the day of pentecost to the bride of jesus christ now from the bride of jesus christ look from the bride of jesus christ that's where grace continues jesus is not hearing human flesh except in your flesh and when we stand in judgment we can't have one mark against us or we're going to have to be judged now as brother dale's been preaching there is a judgment that we have because we walk in this flesh and we have five senses of memory reason conscious effects and imagination have you ever had a bad thought now why does god not take that away i was coming up the road today meditating and i had a bad thought just come out of nowhere and i thought lord why please take that thing away i don't want to think that thought all i heard was the prophet preaching did not my prophet preach the greatest battle ever fought there would be no battle if all those bad thoughts would be done away now we know they're going to be done away when we get a body change amen it's going to change us in our spirit realm and we're not going to have to the bible says the former things have passed away all things have become new but now you got to remember you got to run that to a filter though because i'll always know that sister jim was my wife i know what the prophet said you'll always know that that's what went on but you won't remember all the other junk that you did the fights that you had and when you had to sleep on the couch one night and all these different things you know so i've never done that before but maybe some of y'all have you can tell me about it but but through grace though through grace though what happens in grace even grace that you have for the people around you that's where that god's gonna judge through the grace that you give somebody as i've always said somebody changes your tire somebody gives you a cup of water when you read that scripture that word grace is not in that scripture but that's the most that's the most graceful thing that god could ever do was to give eternal life to somebody that didn't want it see that's unmerited favor amen now remember you and i can't we can't do that though if we've been to remember the bible says in romans if we come to a knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice for that you're not going to be able to plead ignorance that's right but that guy out there can that's never heard anything except through me and you and what we give him so it is all in who you know but you got to know him first that's right then you can extend him out to the people and see that's grace for this world listen we are the only grace on this earth at the moment once we leave this place there will be no grace for the gentile world which is 99 of the world will become ungraceful and that's why they're going to try to kill each other now the grace is going to go to the jews to get 144 000 so grace has not left the earth completely but don't think you can make it there is no grace for me and you once the rapture takes place gentiles you might be a foolish version but i don't think you're going not sitting here today you're not going to play the foods virgin you know too much so you need to get in but it's unmerited divine assistance given to humans for for their regeneration or sanctification a virtue coming from god so it is it to me it's the highest virtue it's grace if you don't have grace you're dead all right a state of sanctification enjoyed through divine assistance and then i like this one right here approval everybody wants to nowadays we're all online and everybody wants an approval rating everybody wants a four-star or a five-star right everybody wants a review and that's how google and all the people put you up here where people can see you is because of your approval rating well i want to ask you a question can your neighbors and can your friends give you a four-star rating for being a christian or do we have lesser reviews and comments that we need to work that we need to work on y'all been through and y'all know what i'm talking about you buy anything online the first thing you get is an email that says can you review this product how did we do how did we get it there fast did was it the product you ordered was it at a competitive rate well that's the same thing we're doing now we've been doing this forever we just not do it been doing it in a computer because if we're going to judge the earth come on if we're going to judge the earth we need to have a four-star rating that's right we need to have you know no negative reviews and by grace we can or by our approval rating so let's go to genesis 6 verse 8 where noah found approval in the eyes of the lord and he wasn't even born again but he was a chosen vessel he actually said lord i believe you're going to reign on this earth and you're going to have to have somebody to build an ark or somebody to get away for these people to make it through because i see you're getting ready to destroy the world right and we'll talk about this afternoon a little more about prophets that's why god sends prophets on the earth he sends prophets for what judgment but he also but it's judgment to the world but his salvation to me and you it's judgment to the world but it's grace to me and you amen and that's what we've come under i don't know i i don't know why people have a problem well i do know why because you look at brother branham and you and you call his name and the first thing they say is well we can't you know he's way off the norm we can believe a prophet over here because he's normal prophet so-and-so and prophet so and so and prophetess so-and-so because because they don't hurt my feelings they let me do whatever i want to do it's way over here on greasy grace but then you got brother adam sitting over here a prophet a vindicated prophet and they don't want to listen to him but see when god sends a prophet that's unmerited grace to a generation a merited approval he sent noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so let's go to exodus 33. and let's just go over this but look therefore i pray that if i have found grace what approval now wait a minute at this moment of time moses is still a murderer he murdered an egyptian god didn't pay any attention to that he did let him go 40 years in the wilderness to get all that burn out of him the prophet said but he came back by a burning bush experience and by that burning bush experience he found grace in the eyes of the lord because listen god was god was going to kill those people moses get out of the way i'll i'll destroy him and one time the bible says he said moses get out of the way i'll destroy them all and i'll raise up a whole another generation when i listen that's exactly what god did god's not ever going to say something and it's not going to happen because eventually the ones he wanted to kill died and a new generation rose up and went into the promised land so noah found i mean moses found grace in thy sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and the lord said my presence will go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not hence for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou go us with us now what he's saying he's just like he said one time before and i think brother adam even made the comment and i'm trying to stay away from so many quotes that will just give you scripture so that if anybody is watching they can see justice by scripture that we can prove everything that we're that we believe it's not just the prophet of god said everybody understand that amen and we love quotes but there is some time that you have to move them out of the way so that you can explain that it's been in the bible the whole time but what moses is saying moses is saying god they're going to laugh at you the nations are going you brought us out with a mighty hand you brought us into this wilderness you picked these people you know what he said you chose them you picked them now you want to kill them and all the nations are going to say well this god just brought them out just to kill them all that's what he's saying and moses said i beseech you lord please don't destroy him and in one place remember what he says he says if you're going to take them you got to kill me in other words you've got to come over me now what was that that was grace of god that moses had a revelation [Music] that god wasn't going to kill them people if he didn't kill moses but now what happened remember god backed off but what did god say he said i'll make sure they don't make it into the promised land so he did destroy and did raise up another generation for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name he's talking about the lord the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken now see you got to look at this it didn't change god's mind but every you moses has got to speak it for it to become something remember brother brown said a thought a thought then you speak it and it becomes word moses what did he do he caught the thought of god and then he spoke it well see he caught the thought of god that god was not going to destroy him because the lord said i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found favor our approval in my sight and i know thee by name and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory and he wanted to see god and god showed him now let's go to ruth we were covering this last week but there's so much about grace we look in this sea with boaz and ruth we know that boaz saw this woman out in the field and he didn't know her but he didn't know that there was something different about her and then what did he do he said okay he said i'm going to protect you in other words don't leave this field do not leave this message do not leave this grace that you're under amen because if you leave this grace that you're under i can't protect you if you go glean in someone else's field i can't do what i'm supposed to do but if you'll stay in this field which he knew she would god knew she would by foreign she the bride the real bride would stay in his field but now look what she done verse 10 and she fell down on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes and i see it at us we're so unworthy we go through every day we go through every hour we have all these bad thoughts we have all these things that come among us and we say man how can i be saved listen the prophet of god i think he was using a quote from someone else but he said that you can't help for the birds to fly over your head but just don't let them make a nest there now see that's what you and i should learn because when we were sinners what happened when that evil bird flew over we let him make a nest right and he laid eggs and he stayed there he resided there but see that's why the bible says when the unclean spirit goes out of a man in other words you drive him out of that nest you better get filled up with god or that same demon is going to come back with a bunch of his other bird friends and you're going to be 10 times worse or seven times worse so we must not worry about our thoughts unless we entertain them have i got that don't entertain them if you just say lord i don't want to think that thought and you know what most of the time start singing start praising the lord starting thank you lord and now that thing will leave you because the devil doesn't like to be around when the lord's around so why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou should take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger and boaz answered and said to her it hath fully been showed me so see bill as topping christ he knew before the foundation of the world now boaz didn't but in topping christ he knew he said i know i knew that you were going to be here and all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law in other words he probably had a few spies boaz was a powerful man and he didn't have ties to ruth but he had ties to naomi and in having ties to naomi he was watching naomi and he was watching this new girl this new bride he was watching her to see what she would do that's why when the bible tells you that if you're good to israel the nation that's good to israel is good to you well that israel naomi tops israel right the old old israel the old woman though typed israel and then that's why we don't say anything about the jews we don't have anything bad to say about them at all and then god's going to honor that that's why that god has honored this united states of america for all these years as we have been a friend of israel now the first time and it's coming up during this administration now the first time it's going to come up you watch and see we're going to turn against israel and then that's when all heck's going to break loose because i just feel that's what's keeping it until all this is going on now you let it you you let us withdraw from israel and you're going to see the firefall because of the bible that's right because of this right here boaz's answer says look it's been fully showed me all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how that thou has left our father and our mother in other words she gave all she left everything left the land of thy nativity and now what is the land of not by nativity and we'll stop right here that was her first birth you must leave the land of your nativity your first birth amen you need to go to a land that's not of your first birth because she left everything she what left all of her world all of her friends all of her family didn't jesus come up and say you got to forsake father mother sister brother and come and follow me so she went to the when you got born again you left the land of your first nativity and you became into a place of bethlehem which is the house of god you came into the house of god and then that's when boaz took over with ruth is when she came into his house not just stick house his domain and then he said i'll protect you so we're gonna have to stop right there the lord recompensed i work and a full reward be given thee of the lord of god of israel unto whose wings thou art come to trust like i said before israel is a type of the bride it typed in the old testament under even the law but we'll cover next sunday or maybe not we're not going to do it next sunday we'll be the sunday afternoon we won't have any bible study or bible school next sunday at the july 4th so let's stop right there and then we'll continue with grace but just remember grace was only given by god himself when he became human flesh for me and you the bride he came to get a bride by grace are you saved i didn't get to that but it's in here by saved by grace or you want saved through what faith ruth had to believe though that boaz could do what he said he would do and remember what she did she had to go back to naomi and tell naomi what was going on and naomi said stay in this field he's going to be your he's going to be your spouse one of these days you need to stay right where you're at in other words when the when the lord left israel and came to us he came to a gentile bride so god bless you let's bow our heads when i get finished praying musicians come on the heavenly father we thank you today for this love that you give us call grace and it is not grace lord that we can just do whatever we want to lord but it's grace according to the word of god and that way we pass from death into life and pass away from judgment that you gave us lord unmerited favor but then as that unmet merited favor's been extended lord we do as ruth we didn't just take that frivolously and go running back off to our other country no we stayed and we fell in love with you and we became your bride and we lord cherish you lord that you gave us this grace and that will not ever turn it into lasciviousness like the bible tells us that we'll not take it frivolously that we'll take it lord is unmerited approval from my almighty god thank you lord for all these things we ask in jesus name you'll take care of this service amen musicians come
