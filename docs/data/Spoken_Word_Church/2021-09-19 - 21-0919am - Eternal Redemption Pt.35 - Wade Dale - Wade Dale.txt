========================================

uh tim calhoun this morning he'll be back this afternoon and then today after the second service we need to just we're going to just stay up here and then we'll meet about next weekend what we're going to do um food wise because brother andrew glover will be here and it'll be our youth service and uh we'll have it saturday starting at three o'clock so and we'll have the same format that we had last time uh we're going to also make sure that we all wear a mask inside the sanctuary during that time so we're going to need to announce that if you have some people that are coming tell them that we'll be wearing our mask inside the sanctuary just like we are now all right and also let's see wednesday brother aaron will be preaching wednesday and i think that's all the announcements i have good to be here good to have brother russ dunker with us from minnesota and uh good to have him with us today he's uh he's been down fellowship and some it's always good to have him here so if you turn to hebrews 9 we'll get started kind of background a little bit from wednesday and then try to finish up this afternoon on the future home we're not going to we're not going to say much about the future home because i have not seen ear hath not heard all the beautiful things about that future home that the only way we're going to know about is we're going to be there just don't miss it if you don't miss it you'll be there but i the prophet of god said that he built it by your desire so whatever desire you have that's what that's the way he built it and he built it for you um now we're going to talk about the millennium where we build and inhabit not us the bride but where the 144 000 and the different ones in the millennium they build houses and they will inhabit it but you and i will have to we don't we don't need a house all right so hebrews 9 11. just remember the sick ones good to have brother gary back and sister julie and all the different ones gathering them back together getting over this old uh coveted business and and um we still hearing reports of people passing on uh around the message and brother russell and i were talking about yesterday we're not immune from it but we still got a god that answers prayers we've still got a god that'll answer prayer amen and the prophet of god and the bible tells us these light afflictions these light afflictions that we have to go through are for our perfection if you're the bride of jesus christ amen so let's go to hebrews 9 let's pray before we get started the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you sanctify us for this journey that we're on lord i pray that you touch us in spirit lord give us revelation you be the one that does the speaking father also touch the ones lord that are sick and body that you'll raise them up for your honor and glory father we know you are the healer you even heal people that don't even ask to be healed all over the world there's people being healed right now that doesn't even know you as their savior father what a good god that we have lord so what much more if a child of god gets on their knees and cries out to the father and says daddy i need help and we need help as the bride lord to get ourselves ready to get out of here lord we pray that you'd be with each one that's not here lord be with the ones that are traveling the ones that are on vacation in different places we pray that you'd give them traveling mercies and be with each one father as we participate in this service may you come down lord and be the active participant in jesus name we ask these things amen all right so let's finish this should be finishing today and then we'll start on something else lord willing a little bit later on but i've enjoyed this eternal redemption it's just it's brought out a lot of a lot of things to me that we we think sometimes we and we do we know the we know the the overlying plan of redemption we know that we were lost and now we're redeemed but then you've got all these little things these little blessings is what i call them they're blessings that we get along the way and the real blessing is is over there at the end in the future home that's our real blessing and then that we can uh have a body change on the earth and then go to that place it's just supernatural that's never happened before like that where a center-borne person takes a body change all right like we're going to so let's read hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us let's go to isaiah 65 for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind let's read one more matthew 25 31 and we may pick this up some on the son of man later on but watch this when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him now what is the son of man in his glory that's me and you that's me and you the glory of the son of man is me and you all right because we become the son of man and then we continue on as god in human flesh called a bride and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory now this is this is um this is at the white throne judgment nobody got that because watch it says and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divide us his sheep from the goats now it doesn't mean they are sheep but he's dividing them as sheep and goats as the great shepherd would stand and the goats go over here and the sheep go over here all right you may be seeding the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word but it all begins with this in matthew 16 verse 15 he said and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said in him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed that unto you but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee they are peter and upon this rock revelation i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it knowing that the gates of hell has always been against the true church of god and as we were talking wednesday night you got to remember that that thank god that a prophet came and told us that we can read in the bible and we see a group of people and the world wants to call them church god calls them bride because there's now a separation between church and bride the wife has made herself ready not the church the church is the church nominal that's the church out there that's the that's the foolish virgin that's the cup of water in my name that's even the ones that's not going to make it amen that's the church now we know that brother branham talks about us being the church of the living god but now as we come to the end time though i want to hone that down to where we're the bride we're his wife we have been married to him and we are getting we are going to make ourselves ready to go to another dimensions everybody got to have to say amen i will build my church so now when we interpret that that's not going i will build a church because there's many churches out there you know god said i will build my church so my church is the bride it's not anything else my church is the bride all right so now and then all then what happened to that bride that went through seven church ages they had seven messengers they had seven messages they had a group of people that come under their messenger that they lived it the best they could and they got the baptism of the holy ghost they died some of them under-martyred them some of them died from just natural causes but now we've come up to this last church age and if you're born again today you've been called out of that church age you're not in that church nominal and then after we see that and and then we're after we come to a position and we've already talked about this that's why i'm trying to get through it a little bit but you got to put in there and i like brother russ we're talking about something yesterday i hadn't really seen it this way which so i'll bring it out i'll just use it buddy just if it's copyrighted just chart send me a bell but we were talking about you know the bible doesn't tell us to have the faith of enoch now you know it was translated that he could didn't see death enoch was the top of the bride right but now why does the bible tell us we must have the faith of abraham it didn't say have the faith of enoch it says we must have the faith of abraham we are we are part of that abraham covenant why abraham took a body change on this earth and produced the promised child that's why we should have the faith of abraham the bible doesn't say like i said it doesn't have the faith of enoch we must have the faith of abraham the faith of abraham was that he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he took a body change from that old vile 99 year old body that he had changed back to a young man well that's the faith that you and i gotta have is for a resurrection a body change and a rapture and it's gotta be in that order a resurrection voice of the resurrection the trump of god will sound the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain will be changed and then we'll be caught up as here in revelations 4 1 says after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither i will show thee things which must be hereafter now he's fixing to show john after the church ages he's fishing show john prophetic prophetic um happenings from now until the future home comes there in revelations 20 something 22 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne so we took a rapture we went up come up hither and then we know that after we leave this place matthew 24 21 for then shall be great tribulations such as not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be the great tribulation listen you and i go through tribulation tribulation worketh patience right but we will not go through the great tribulation the great tribulation is the wrath of god poured out upon a sinful earth there's nobody here that's got the holy ghost once 144 000 leave there's nobody on earth with the holy ghost so god just there's no reason for him to hold back his wrath because everybody all the players that were that were put into this eternal plan of redemption has been plugged in and taken out all right because remember the sinners are not considered in redemption you know what the prophet of god said we're the only ones considered in redemption and then connected to us is the foolish virgin and connected to the 144 and then the cup of water in my name and then after that there's no connection amen they have decided to go the way of the goat and there's nothing we can do about it but see that's all that's going to be here when this great tribulation happens and he says even except these days should be shortened there will be no flesh saved for the but for the elect sate those days shall be shortened and thank god we always complain about uh you know the year's getting shorter but you know what i don't want the years get longer i want the ears to get shorter it gives us one more day to get out of here all right so now let's go to revelations 2 verse 20. notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffered that woman jezebel now what's he talking about he's talking about the religious world he's talking about the church which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication my servants see how close it is and eat things sacrificed into idols and i give her space to repent two thousand years of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into great tribulation if you'll read in the bible where we're looking at the great tribulation and we see that even when russia puts the bomb down the middle of the vatican and and all that that if you read your bible the bible says merchants of the earth and the great men and the and the and the politicians or whatever you want to call them they're standing in all and they're standing away from the city because they don't have anything to do with it now but they're they're wondering what is this great thing well they've all been deceived by it and at that time it's been years they've been deceived by it but they lean to their economy and their money rather than leaning to god amen behold i will cast her into a bed and them that committed adultery with her into great tribulation except they repented their deeds and most will not so revelations 13 4 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is likened to the beast now who is this this is the people of the earth they're in love with this guy and they they just think they think so much of him they think he's christ he's you know he's the he's the man of the hour he's the christ of the hour and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things in blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 42 months that's 260 days and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it would give them him to make war with the saints to overcome them and power was given unto him over kindred tongues and nations now here in all that dwell upon the earth all every person that dwells on the earth excuse me shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that's the bride that's the eternal section of that lamb's book of life not the section that judas was in and was taken out of or then the same way with people that judas wasn't the only one that got his name put on the boat and took out no there's millions and probably billions that hazard was put on the book as a religious order and they're going to be taken off just like judas was because they didn't go get the holy ghost only the people with the baptism of the holy ghost has those names written in that lamb's book of life the eternal section amen the eternal section not just the section of the book the eternal section that's the genesis 1 26 man that's the one that that the everybody talks about the seed and the seed the dock to the seed doctrine the seed seed that genesis 1 26 that's your seed but it was withholding that you come here with it because you can't have to come here a sinner to be redeemed to be redeemable listen there's some people it's not redeemable adolf hitler but he decided that god didn't he decided to not be redeemable that's your free moral agency amen so now let's go to revelations 11 3 and i will give him power give power to my two witnesses now here we've already took a rapture we've gone into rapture we're going to the wedding supper we're in another dimension doesn't matter what we're going to be doing but what's going to happen on the earth is continue because listen once we go to come to a body change and once all the dead saints come out of the ground and they take a body change they've completed their redemption okay we've completed the bride will complete their redemption when we take a rapture off of this earth we've completed our redemption we're just going to be here on a honeymoon or we're going to be in a wedding supper in a honeymoon and then we're going to stand in judgment not in judgment but not to be judged but to stand in judgment to judge and then we're going to a future home that's our house and there's no other position i mean i don't know where there's some place that we're going to get crowns and all the the things that the bible tells us about but i really don't know where that position is at and it really doesn't matter just make sure you get there i don't mind if he gives me one crown just look at me and say you've done a good job you kept the faith you fought the fight and now here is a crown of life what eternal life but listen see we receive that eternal life crown here we receive our white robes here you see what god's done for his children he's he's made it we think we think this is so hard but he's made it easy life is hard life is hard but being a christian shouldn't be thou hard in the soul part of you whether you're hurting and whether you're whether you're laying in a bed of affliction or not that's not your soul your soul if it's born again is already in the future home it's a part of the future home it can't there's there's no way it can be pulled out there's no way it can be judged as far as eternal versus not eternal it's done it's finished as we were talking about wednesday night but you got to remember that old husband's got to be d-e-a-d not d-i-v-o-r-c-e dead if it is dead it'll never resurrect again did i misspell that i didn't okay and was looking at me laughing divr's oh don't be singing the song come on people good grief so now we'll talk about tammy wynette and um george jones for the rest of the service because that's the rest of y'all going to be singing it in your head or whoever that was the thing that's on oh geez so anyway so it's not that's the problem that is the problem is the divorce part because listen if that old husband's dead he can't be resurrected you you can't have you can't have the old um what is it luke what luke something that the unclean spirit goes out well see that unclean spirit goes out but now if it comes back it's still alive but you gotta have you got to kill that thing or it will reside back that's why it divorced but it's still alive and it came back and found the house sweat and garnished okay and then he re-entered that house well now the bible says the good man of the house kills that thing in another scripture the good man of the house so you take if he's the strong man or the strong man of the house if he kills that spirit it won't come back anymore now listen the devil's too smart for that he'll try to get you in another angle or another way or as we were talking a couple days ago you know like dad said he never drank beer in his life but boy once you get saved and born again somebody pops open a beer and you're going that looks so good why the devil the devil has lost his hold on you going and participating in that again but he knows there's a spirit realm of you that still remembers what you did and he absolutely reminds you listen god doesn't remind you of your past because he doesn't know it's there because it's d-e-a-d when it's put in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again there's that death that we're talking about that we put it in that watery grave and we leave it there we don't pull it back out that's our problem sometimes we drag things back out under the blood don't do that because see you'll have a problem and the devil knows it just as soon as you do it because he'll start pounding on you and pounding on you but he's that's his job but now we've already taken a rapture so we're gone up in the wedding supper and we're in another dimension but god is not finished with the eternal plan of redemption because the connection that we have with 144 000 is they're going to get the same message we got right they're only going to get it though through two witnesses where we got it through a gentile prophet they're going to get it through moses and elijah being jews over there that they will be able to what they'll be able to understand them all right and i will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and then they're going to preach to them go to daniel 9 24. and we go back to the 70 weeks of daniel boy i've really i've really been wanting to get back into 70 weeks of daniel so we may do that later on if the lord tarries but 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things what's the first three finish the transgression who did the transgressing israel are you all right who did the sinning you did israel did and who's going to reconcile us for the iniquity that we that we had it's going to be god so listen we get saved the same way they did as as as we've been talking before you're never going to get away from justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost that's the three stages or or steps of grace and even the 144 000 that they're going to be preached to by two witnesses and they're going to realize that what they did they killed the messiah well they literally killed him their lineage we didn't literally kill him but we did put him on the cross amen i mean we weren't there but when they said let his blood be on us and our children it carried through the 2000 years that god was dealing with the gentiles they had that curse on them they had a transgression they had a sin they had an iniquity that god was going to purge as we'll maybe read it a little bit later well here in jeremiah you talk about jacob's trouble not ours jacob's trouble all right so let's read that in jeremiah 30. now we know the other three we had the we didn't read the last three bringing everlasting righteousness self-division prophecy in north the most holy we know that's going on into the millennium alas for that day is that day is great so that none is like it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it look at all the promises that god he condemns i've been reading in amos and all the little all the little prophets man they just cut israel to the core they call them and prostitutes and and i think it was amos or one of them god told them to go marry a prostitute to show israel that they married the prophet that they were prostitutes and have children by them and god condemns them condemns them condemns them then all of a sudden he says but i'm going to save you i can't forget you i'm going to save you even in the 70 weeks of daniel well if it wasn't for the 70 weeks of daniel israel couldn't be saved but even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him strangers russians germans americans wherever they've been dispersed the jew has been persecuted everywhere i mean they kicked them out right and left it was just that they got them down in one place where hitler could deal with them during the during the holocaust but that was god though bringing his children back his children that he worked with the first time but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king who i will raise up unto them now we're heading toward the millennium therefore fear their fear they are not o servant jacob saith the lord need to be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity russia germany united states italy wherever they're dispersed i'm going to save you from that but now remember daniel 70 weeks is talking about the people and what the city they got to get back to the city they got to get back into their homeland and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee and measure and will not leave thee all together unpunished now remember they weren't unpunished my lord look at israel they've been persecuted since the time that they said let his blood be on us and our children they've been killed and slaughtered and six and a half million of them just because they were jews were killed not because they did anything they were just jews and they were killed because satan hated them so bad through hitler and all stalin and all those so let's go to revelation 6 verse 12. and we get to the sixth seal like we were talking about wednesday night i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal although there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and ireland were moved out of their places wow and see here the kings of the earth and the great men the rich men chief captains the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman brother russ and i were talking about you know we we're looking for a total collapse of the economy and it will happen there'll be a crash for us at least the united states but somehow it gets all put back together under something called the catholic church or the rome some way they get look it says the rich men it's not that everybody's destitute now we don't care because we're gone but the world's gonna have to build an economy back up to have all these things the kings great men rich men chief captains mighty men every bondman and every free man that's us the ones that don't have the money hidden themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains instead of the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb now we're heading toward the battle of armageddon here for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand so now let's read revelation 7 1 and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds water winds wars that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the scene or on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and cry with a loud voice of the four angels to whom was given to hurt the earth and sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants now listen you and i are not servants okay we're bride so that's not us but it is a group of people that's going to be saved till we have sealed what is the seal the baptism of the holy ghost until we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads all right appear they're intelligent and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel in other words 12 000 from 12 tribes okay 144 000. everybody got that i'm sure that that's pretty simple but just make sure that we realize this is not the bride this is servants we're already gone that's why you have to realize that when brother branham said from revelations 4 1 to 1921 has nothing to do with gentiles because we're not on the earth at that time remember revelations 4 1 we go up we're not here we don't come back till we read it in a minute to revelation 19 21 come back right into the millennium but now in between that we must get the spiritual part of that because it's part of the eternal plan of redemption amen so it is part of your redemption the seals the vials the plagues you and i will not see this with our physical eyes i hope not but we get the spiritual aspect of all these seals vials plagues that's what we talked about wednesday night on that sixth seal let's read daniel 9 27. we'll talk about that just for just for a minute and he shall confirm the covenant who's that he the antichrist that's the one that's going to what he's going to confirm the covenant with israel not the world he's going to have a covenant with israel for one week because we're still on daniel 9. who is it daniel's people and the city all right so it's not talking to the gentiles it's talking to daniel's people and in the midst of the week in other words after three and a half years that's the midst of the seven years that are left after the rapture of the church according to the bible and according to the prophet's message he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease whatever he made that covenant with whatever it is he's going to break it and say we're not going to do that anymore all right and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation now what is the consummation that's the millennium because the consummation to the jews is entering into that jubilee of the millennium see this is not to us remember this is not to the bride we're gone but there are going to be a literal overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determine shall be poured out upon the desolate in other words there's going to be a war there's going to be two prophets that's going to cause this world to just turn upside down because of the sixth seal i read it there where he opened the sixth seal and the prophet of god thank god for a prophet that told us who opens that sixth seal that six seals opened by those two prophets it is man or not man but god through man holding all nature just like adam did before the fall but i believe it's going to happen to me and you before that time comes because there's got to be a type we've got to see the type that they're going to do it literally on the earth but god's going to have to as we were talking wednesday night that we're going to have to have a sixth seal sanctification like never before that that statue of a perfect man is going to have to burn out all the mountains burn out all the valleys he's going to have to take off whatever this is right here says i'll be held when he opened the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake i'm telling you folks if you hadn't been shook these past two years if you hadn't been shook and you're right to down to your own physical being in these last two years you got a problem but you know what god's doing i was thinking yesterday he said there was ease in zion hadn't needed nothing in revelations 3. i mean look at us we're driving cars that cost more than our first house cost we got jobs that make good money if this is tribulation it's not so bad but god's going to make it to where we don't like this place anymore we've come to a point to where god said i've had enough this is too easy you're not praying enough you're not seeking god enough because what's going to happen to those two witnesses they're going to call down anything they brother brown said whatever comes out of their mouth that's what's going to happen now i believe that you and i are going to see that in its in part here as the gentile church age ends or gentile age ends you're going to see it with the two witnesses but you're going to see it before that in me and you because listen to come to adoption it's got to come to what full authority so what's the two witnesses going to have full authority over nature so now god is going to have full authority over your nature that's our problem there's too much of us still alive amen so that six seal sanctification has got to come to me and you and remember what is it it's what proceeds out of those two witnesses mouth it's a sharp sword it's a it's a flame of fire it's the word amen so you and i have to come to word maturity first and coming to word maturity because if you don't then as we were talking yesterday power without character is satanic so if you got the power but you don't have the character you might destroy somebody you just really don't like and that's not for you to do amen same thing with this sixth seal because what happens after the sixth seal opens the two witnesses are killed right but there's a rapture takes place after the sixth seal opens the seventh seal produces itself which is christ brings christ to the earth to fight for israel but it brings christ to the earth for me and you to take a rapture with amen amen so we are we're looking at that six seal sanctification before the dead can come out of the ground that's what we're looking at we're look we're under that six seal sanctification to where we're looking at something that will happen that's never happened before that you're going to call all the dead saints out of the ground but it's going to have to come by the word proceeding out of somebody's mouth that comes to maturity see because the two witnesses and the 144 thousand they don't have to come to that maturity they're promised the holy ghost they're promised that then they're going to have to die and then they're going to take a rapture they're going to you know resurrect and then take a rapture in just a few days but we're looking at there's no telling how many thousands of bride that's laying in the earth that's going to come up in that day and they're going to be here as as brother russ was talking about yesterday you know that's going to happen and we're not even going to have a glorified body think about it the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed but remember there was somebody did it before we did the lord jesus walked up to the tomb of lazarus in a human corrupt body and he said lazarus come forth he wasn't in a glorified body when he caught lazarus and stuff out of the ground he was just a human being man now i say just but the almighty god was inside of him well listen that same almighty god if it's inside of you you've got the new birth it's the same identical thing that's what i'm trying to tell everybody we're thinking we're something separate from that but brother brown said the resurrection lies inside of you well where where was it in jesus it was inside of him he didn't have to go find it or go get it or shout it up or pump it up that's the only time he ever raised his voice i believe he said lazarus come forth because about the bible said he cried with a loud voice that and when he died ain't no need to be screaming at the devil screaming at the devil ain't going to bother him one bit but i'll guarantee you if you go get those virtues sealed in you and the headstone comes that's what he can't find he can't fight that because he's not he can't come to it so he's not going to fight it he can't fight him all right so let's look at revelations 11 verse 7-12 and when they shall have finished their testimony the beasts that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so they're going to kill them and their dead bodies shall line the streets of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified so that would be jerusalem and they of the people and kindred and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts one to another i was reading a quote where brother brown said the only there was one country that started that and that was rome when they'd have a battle and they'd come back from the battle they'd be given gifts and i think some of them even talked about the uh the little thing you see the little reeds on around the headbands of some of those romans they were given those as gifts because they came back and won a battle or they won something they were always giving gifts so that's brother brown said that's what's going to happen is the gift giving is going to be from rome because you know what they're going to persecute if rome controls the world that's who they're persecuting the two witnesses because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither same as revelations 4 1 come up ether so they're going to take a rapture and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them so let's look at the chart for me if you would pull that chart up brother brother anderson not the daniel 70 wheats one but the one for the eternal plan of redemption so now where are we at make that a little bigger right over there bringing it this way come on over a little bit more there you go all right so all born-again believers are going into rapture revelations 4 1. two prophets are going to prophesy three and a half years the tribulation period revelations 11 the two prophets and then what is going to be a rapture for the jews so that takes everybody off the earth that has anything to do with the holy ghost everybody got that there won't be a holy ghost of in anybody in this group that's left so what's going to happen what's going to happen is you're going to see the battle of armageddon you're going to see the termination of forces and we'll talk about that in just a second but let's go to revelations 19 verse 6 because this is going to help me and you i want to i want to bring something in here and i heard it as it were the voice of a great multitude in the voice of many waters the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted that she be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god you remember brother branham talking about the armored meat packing girl or the armored meat packing guy and then the the sisters or the girls well it's real strange i was talking to brother claude the other day and he said you know he said brother branham he tells that story all through his ministry till he gets to the sixth seal and on the sixth seal he tells the same story and he never tells it again what is your sixth seal sanctification the bride has made herself ready and the armored meat packing girl i don't know you know most of you know the story but there was armor armor hot dogs everybody knows with armor meat packing they were a meat company in chicago and they went out west and they were going to have a little shin dig out there and they were going to have a party and they were going to dance but the the son of the meat packing company went out there to find him a wife so what happened was is all the other girls got their self and put on their paint and their you understand what i'm saying but there was one girl that was off in the corner that was doing what she was doing work brother brown said she had an old tattered dress said her hair probably wasn't even fixed up it was just tied up in a bun and she washed the dishes she didn't participate in any of those as brother brown said those denominational ideas she kept herself separate and in keeping herself separate one day the armored meat packing boy walked outside to get away from all that that was going on inside as brother brown said all them denominational ideas he was getting away from trying to get away from those denominational ideas what those women that was fixing their self up and you know what they were trying to make their self ready listen there's not a nominal christian in this world that doesn't think jesus christ is coming and there's not a nominal christian in the world that's not trying to get ready but they don't know how they don't know how to get ready but that little girl she was so special and he walked outside just to get some fresh air the prophet said and he said he looked down there and he looked close to the wash bin and said there she was and he said that's what i'm looking for i'm looking for that character of somebody working and then what happened was to make the story short so we can continue on the armored meat packing guy fell in love with this girl and he said in one year i'll be back to pick you up now the problem with me and you is if the armored meat packing boy would have told us that we would have just said man we got it made no this girl the prophet continues with the story he said i don't know she may have made 75 cents a week or 75 cents a day he said she saved up and bought her wedding dress she saved up and bought her bouquet she made herself ready she went up the statue of a perfect man she didn't set that one year and just say well we're the bride and one year from today he'll be back no the bible says the bride his wife has made herself ready and the prophet of god said oh within that one year said she got herself ready and she bought the dress she bought the the um flowers and said on that day she stood on the porch and said her little denominational sisters were just laughing and giggling saying ah he didn't really mean that he didn't really mean that he was he was coming back she said he said he'll be here and he said for me to be ready he said now she said no i've done my part it's his time to do his part and you know the story five minutes before the time to come up of the hour here comes the buck board here come the armor meat packing boy and she run and jumped in his arms and he said i'm going to take you home you ain't got to wash them dishes no more you ain't got to cry over a dead body anymore you ain't got to cry over a child that's wayward anymore you don't have to cry over needing something from god he said i'm here and that's what this is right here the his wife has made herself ready this girl i believe she worked more that one year to get herself ready than she had worked all the other time she wanted everything to be right but knowing he was coming he was coming together anyway but in one quote brother brown said he kept up with her during that year there's one quote i believe it's in the sixth seal where brother brown said oh he kept up with her he didn't just leave her and then not not he said no he kept up with her that whole year what just to make sure that she was making herself ready and that's what you and i are doing today is we're making it doesn't matter if you go if you listen to one tape or a week or one tape a day as long as you get what you're listening to as long as you let it become a part of you as long as you don't let the devil steal your joy because all the other girls were running around you know they probably were trying to get ready too but they he left them no instruction god left us instruction to get ready and be ready at the time that he comes for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready blessed are they what you're called into the marriage supper now that's when we leave and go out of here to the marriage supper of the lamb forever how long a period of time until the battle of armageddon and all that other listen we've left that part when you take a body change and then you take a rapture you've left all that in this dimension that doesn't carry with you all that stuff the former things have passed away behold all things become new thank god that none of that carries with us see if you have to stand before judgment guess what if you die without god today that baggage stays with you all the way until the white throne judgment that baggage that you wouldn't let go of stays right there with you until the white throne judgment but if you'll give your heart to god and receive the baptism of the holy ghost you'll never have to worry about that garbage anymore amen sure we're having a hard time in life sure there's things going on that never had happened before but listen something's fixing to happen and never has happened before we're getting out of here amen we're looking at something that amos talked of joel talked of nahum ezekiel isaiah because there's always scripture in there that pertains to me and you moses they talked about me and you oh sure they talked about israel but i thought we were the type isaiah told us about the future home told us about the millennium told us about jesus christ was going to come so what are we doing about it are we getting ourselves are we making ourselves more prepared now than we did when he became in love with us and said i want to be your husband and you accepted and said i want to be your wife is it more dear now than the year when he's going to come and pick us up no i believe she was absolutely like i said before she was so meticulous even right up to the moment with whatever she had to do with whatever you do you the word that you read the praying that you do the testifying all the things that we do what are we doing with it because listen he is gonna come and he's gonna pick up somebody he did get one of them four girls the other three got left behind but he did pick one of them up because that one made herself ready amen so what are we doing with it revelations let's read 16 verse 13. all right and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast now the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirit of devils work in miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them to the battle of great day of arm of god almighty now look think about this a little bit yesterday we know what the what are those unclean spirits like frogs the trinitarian doctrine where did it come from out of the mouth of the beast the dragon and the false prophet for they are the spirit of devils working miracles look which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them together into a place called armageddon fighting over religious matters not just economical matters religious matters the three unclean spirits like frogs somebody's going to stand against all this because there's going to be a battle called armageddon and he said behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keep us his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his vial which is going to be the last woe and there comes a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done the battle of armageddon let's read now in victory day let's read what brother brown said about that we talk about several wars wars and rumors of wars v days v days v days and it'll finally wind up into the great battle of armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth so what continues is what what i'm looking at that sixth seal is is that those two prophets release the power over nature and then when they leave it just continues on into this man starts fighting each other she re-purifies herself with atomic blowing we know this is going to be an atomic battle because tonight or this afternoon we're going to talk about a spiritual battle because look this this will kill human flesh beings not spirits not devils now we'll read in a little bit where they're bound and can't work because the people of the people on the earth but it doesn't kill them they have to be put in a place of holding for a thousand years because they have no one to work through but they're still very much alive but listen you and i are going to have to see that spot where all those demons are going to be destroyed all right so then look at again the millennium and the future home is you can you can intertwine some of the things and then some of the things you can't put together to say well it's going to happen in the millennium and it's going to happen in the future home because there's things in the millennium that can't carry over and there's things from the future home that can't back up into the millennium so thank god for a prophet that told us exactly that if we would build houses that's in the millennium the future home was built by god himself for us so it's two different things but see the lamb will be i mean the line will be gentle and the lamb this one will be tame it's takes both sides because when this world's destroyed and we come back to that thousand-year millennial reign it's going to be no war there's a lot of things that we'll read here the bible even tells us there won't be but those demons are still going to be there they're just not going to be able to work all right so let's keep reading she re-purifies herself with this atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and things sinks this soaked blood of men and upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic braids out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here amen i say like that yes sir there's coming a time when it will be great all right let's go to ezekiel 40. now this is we've seen the battle of armageddon everybody okay we've seen the battle of armageddon that's the termination of all forces that's when man dies that's when the flesh of man is destroyed by an atomic explosion all over the world all right everybody got that then there's something got to happen to finish the da and see this is in the middle of the daniel 70 weeks this is in the midst of the week there'll be a battle of armageddon that'll last the battle armageddon's not a one-day battle it's going to last a year or more because of nuclear fallout because of all the different things it's going to probably last maybe a year but somewhere down the line there's going to be a group of people come back in to this dimension according to daniel 70 weeks the last half of that 70th week and they're going to build a millennial temple and it's not going to be built by us but it will be built by them so this is ezekiel 40. like say again thank god for a prophet that could positionally place this because this is the building of a temple but we didn't know that it was going to be a millennial temple and we didn't know we were the ones that's going to rule and reign in it but according to daniel 70 weeks the last part the north the most holy is the anointing of us going into the temple because listen 144 000 if they built it they're going to be the servants not me and you we're not going to build anything in a honeymoon what be a wonderful thing don't ever if you get married don't ever tell your wife so all right tomorrow's the honeymoon we're going to build a house won't last long no what are you going to do you're going to lavish her with everything that you got that's the same way with god and the vision of god brought me into the land of israel so now where are we going back to we're going to israel because remember it's to thy people and the city and the city includes walls and buildings right all right so the people have been purged from the 144 000 they've been purged they took a rapture they're not here in this dimension but somebody's got to come back into this dimension and build this temple in jerusalem and the visions of god brought me into the land of israel and set me upon a very high mountain mount of olives whatever you want to call it by which was as the frame of a city on the south and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose appearance was like into brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood on the gate and the man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that i shall show thee for the intent that i might show them unto thee are thou brought hither declare all that thou seest to the house of who israel all right so now from that scripture down to ezekiel 44 it talks about rooms it talks about putting a wall here it talks about putting a court here that's the building of that temple and they're going to build it the prophet of god said they're going to build it end up getting ready for the millennium they're going to have to build this city to make daniel 9 24-27 come to pass because when they build that city and we go into that city that finishes those 490 years it takes the jews for the city and the people to come to full redemption everybody got that that's why daniel 70 weeks is so important as far as positionally placing things and to get it right when you do positionally place it okay so now let's go to revelations 19 11 because somebody's got a ride back into this place all right after it's being built why would a why in the world would you spend a year or two building a building and then just leave it empty revelations 19 11 says i saw heaven open behold a white horse and he that set up on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war who is this jesus christ we know that his eyes were his flame of fire in his head on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name was called the word of god in the beginning was the word where was with god the word was god that's jesus christ all right and the armies armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fined linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword and that with it he shall smite the nation so what's he coming to do he's not coming down to smite the nations that are there he's going to rule the 12 tribes of israel that is coming into that millennium everybody got that because remember the millenniums to the jews the jews are going to be ruled and reigned for a thousand years by the son of david sitting on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel so if you rule the 12 tribes of israel there's got to be something there to rule so this is what it is and the armies which were in heaven followed him and 0.1 horses which that's us clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his style a name written and we've been through this a hundred times look at that all capital letters not king of little kings and lord of little lords no we have become one with the master we have become one with the king king of kings and lord of lords because for me and you buddy it's finished all we're waiting for is that future home to come listen to this number two and then we'll stop right here it's only that clock right it's only 20 minutes after 11. good grief wow all right on the 70th week of daniel now notice that's where we've seen her coming back to the millennial temple over here at the end of the what what is the jewish age the 70 weeks of i i don't see why people don't see that the jewish age the gentile age finished when we left then there's a time of the 490 years 483 is already done three and a half years was preached by the two witnesses there's three and a half years left after the battle of armageddon now that's finished and at the end of the jewish age they have been saved filled with the holy ghost and built the city they finished daniel 9 24 through 27. over here at the end of the jewish age the anointed here he comes riding on the white horse now he's talking about revelations 19 we just read it those followed him on white horses horses powers dressed in white blood or vesture dipped in blood wrote on him the word of god he cometh the mighty conqueror yes sir to set up the millennium coming to the temple there he meets that 144 thousand so 144 000 has to be down here building the city god's going to be somewhere with us the bride because we're going to ride into that from the dimension we're in into this dimension down here and there he meets the 144 000 and then if you keep going on a little bit further uh i didn't bring that quote but he said the anointing to the temple was me and you he's anointed we're anointed because of the kings and kings and lord of lords we've come to a position that we're going to rule and reign with him for that thousand years but now remember we're not going to rule like he's going to rule because he rules the 12 tribes of israel as the son of david sitting on the throne of david ruling the twelve tribes of israel you and i are just there on the honeymoon because you can if you get a little further we'll read we'll read this afternoon we'll um let's read the millennium a little bit about it and then we'll stop because that millennium there's a lot of things that goes on let's go to the chart just for a second and go all the way over to the right here millennium so we got battle of armageddon everything everybody's killed this is the purging of the earth and all that die they go into the fifth dimension because there's nowhere else to put these people because they're not bribed they're not foolish virgin now they could be cup of water in my name i mean foods virgins in there in the in the cup of water in my name they're not up here with us they don't resurrect because the bible tells it says the second death has no hold on me and you so there is a second death which means that these people that die all down through here that are not born again they're going to have to stay in that fifth dimension until the white throne judgment right here all right then they're going to have to be judged you and i don't have to be judged but the 140 i mean the and 144 thousand but the foolish virgin and the cup of water in my name given eternal life for being good to the bride whatever you want to call it they're not showing up in this millennium everybody got that now the fifth sealed jew you can make an argument for that you can make an argument for the heathen being raised up which i don't understand that but listen just make sure you get there because remember it's not to me and you it's not going to stop me from taking a body change if i can't tell you who's going to be in the millennium okay it's me getting myself ready here i got my revelations 19 they got their self ready then they rode into the millennium and surprise okay but that's what's going to happen there's going to be 1 000 satan is bound there's going to be a thousand year millennial reign so let's read where this comes from ii peter 3 verse 8 says behold beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day genesis 2 verse 17 says but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now we we got to make this scriptural a thousand years of the day days a thousand years now they didn't physically die the day they committed adultery the day eve committed adultery and the day adam did what he did they didn't physically die they spiritually died and they started dying on the outside guy but that very day because remember that curse was put on them and methuselah got closer than anybody 969 years and then adam was 900 and something years and this was 800 and something years they got close to it but they couldn't live that thousand years because the curse they cursed the ground didn't curse adam curse the ground well that's where they all started coming from well and adam was spoken into existence everybody else started coming out of the ground amen you come out of the ground your body come out of the ground so let's go to isaiah 65 then we'll stop right here musicians get ready to come when i get finished reading this and then we'll start right here tonight this afternoon for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem that's where we're going to be jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy now who's the jeru who's the people that dwell in jerusalem jews so the millennium is to the jews it's not to me and you okay and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people who is isaiah jew and the voice of weeping shall be no more hurt in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more than an infant that's an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days now i can't get into that because i don't understand that for the child shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed see the prophet of god that's why he could somebody ask him said well could there be babies born in the millennium he said looks like they can looks like they can't so if he answered it that way i'm not going to argue with him it really doesn't matter to me and this doesn't either but it would be good that god would reveal it if somebody knew what that was but i didn't think anybody was going to die in the millennium so it says a man to die 100 years old a sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed so maybe we can deal with that later on and they shall build houses now look and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them now that's not going to happen in the future home that's going to happen in the millennium because it's still time it is a day it is a time you have weeks and months and days because somebody's got to live a thousand years they shall not build and another inhabit in other words die and give it to their kids they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands that's not me and you now that's the elect of god for for that time the jews but that's not me and you because we're not going to work we'll do what we want to but we're not going to build a house they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord what a promise they will not destroy or hurt in all my holy mountain we'll stop right there and then we'll continue on the millennium and then get into the uh white throne judgment battle of gog and magog and finish with the future home this afternoon so let's stand our feet i know this has been a long subject but if you'll just get some if you just get some pieces of it it'll help you i believe in your uh and your walk with the lord because anytime you talk about the plan of redemption it's got to be you and me because we're considered in that plan of redemption amen let's sing a song worship just a little bit it's only 11 29. let's sing a song oh i am blessed i am blessed are you blessed today think of all the blessings that you've got
