[15:41] dunker from Minnesota sent me a text

[15:47] inches of rain on the ground so the
[15:51] difference the difference both Donnie

[16:05] to be in the house of the Lord let's go
[16:06] and turn to the book of Revelation six
[16:08] let's continue our thought we're on the
[16:11] second part of the of the fifth seal
[16:14] we're just gonna review again today and
[16:20] bring a few thoughts a couple of
[16:23] thoughts I want to cover today but let's
[16:25] go ahead and and start go to revelation
[16:28] 6 verse 9 and let's bow our head before
[16:32] we get started the only father Lord
[16:34] today we've set aside a time to hear
[16:38] from You Lord now I pray Lord that the
[16:40] time will be not it'll be not just a
[16:44] waste of time Lord that it would be a
[16:46] revelation in our heart something to
[16:49] keep and hold and and nourish us through
[16:52] the week and nourish us through our life
[16:54] Lord we're coming down toward the end
[16:56] and the final push I believe it's going
[16:59] on now so Lord just come among us and
[17:03] reveal yourself to us because without
[17:05] you here Lord doing the speaking Lord
[17:08] they would be just a meeting of minds
[17:09] but lord I pray that that meeting of
[17:12] minds will all come under the come under
[17:15] the umbrella of the Holy Spirit today
[17:16] Lord and that you'll come among us Lord
[17:19] and heal the sick ones out in the
[17:22] building father and the ones that are
[17:24] not with us Lord may they may they
[17:27] receive their healing now father you
[17:29] already did it at Calvary
[17:31] may they just believe now Lord let's
[17:34] just be with us take care of us be with
[17:36] the missionaries on the foreign fields
[17:38] give them fruit for their labor father
[17:40] just forgive us of our sins and our
[17:41] mistakes clear our minds and our hearts
[17:43] for just a little while that we speak
[17:45] about you in Jesus name we pray amen
[17:49] revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had
[17:51] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[17:53] altar the souls of them that were slain
[17:55] for the word of God and for the
[17:57] testimony which they held and they cried
[18:00] with a loud voice saying how long O Lord
[18:02] holy and true dost thou not judge and
[18:04] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[18:06] the earth question and white robes were
[18:09] given unto every one of them and it was
[18:11] said unto them that they should rest yet
[18:12] for a little season until their
[18:15] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[18:16] that should be killed as they were
[18:18] should be fulfilled you may be seated in
[18:21] the Lord as blessing to the reading of
[18:24] the word prop man brother Danny is not
[18:28] here today so he's little under the
[18:34] weather
[18:40] Regina did you did you make this the a
[18:42] team just because Terrence is on this
[18:44] side huh
[18:46] he's always talking about sending the B
[18:49] team to do stuffing so now you got the B
[18:52] team over here and a team over here I
[18:53] don't know if he paid you to say that or
[18:56] what no you didn't okay all right maybe
[19:00] it was just a devil I don't know but
[19:07] some said they couldn't see this so I
[19:11] want to kind of go over it again but I
[19:15] know it's got a glare to it and it's not
[19:18] real black looking but whole thing I can
[19:23] tell you to do is is tomorrow when they
[19:26] are this evening when they upload it
[19:28] guys I want you to zoom in on this thing
[19:31] here they got a camera on it now to zoom
[19:33] in on it and just kind of if you want to
[19:35] see it happen go to the website and view
[19:42] this again and then you can see what I'm
[19:44] talking about so just get a flash of it
[19:47] and you'll know kind of what we're doing
[19:50] I know it's hard for the ones in the
[19:51] back cause a long building to see but I
[19:54] know there's that was about four people
[19:57] came up to me Sunday afternoon and even
[19:59] Wednesday night and said that that kind
[20:00] of cleared up a lot that that they had
[20:04] that we admit doing the four seals
[20:06] because we come under here and we see
[20:08] that that we take a rapture so when we
[20:12] take a rapture then what's going to
[20:15] happen is is God starts dealing with the
[20:18] Jews right so God starts dealing with
[20:21] the Jews then that's not for us but but
[20:23] Co five six and seven to me is one of
[20:25] the most important ones because it has
[20:27] to come back under here and as I said
[20:30] before steal one two three and four
[20:33] tells us the whole plan of redemption
[20:37] that's the whole plan of redemption
[20:39] that's what that's thanks that's the
[20:41] mind of God all right
[20:44] seal five six and seven tell us how this
[20:46] happens tell us why and the all white
[20:48] brother Brown will read it in just a
[20:50] little while but I want to cover two
[20:51] things real quick
[20:53] I want to read that quote that I found
[20:54] because I want us to realize we are I
[21:00] read you the quote the other day about
[21:03] 20 times where brother Branham says that
[21:06] when when we come under the revelation
[21:08] of the Son of Man it comes in a
[21:09] different way it's different from the
[21:13] Son of God revelation the son of man
[21:14] revelation is something that man has
[21:16] never come under and then we ting up now
[21:20] listen though because of our traditions
[21:22] are we staying where we added up moving
[21:25] on into the son of man revelation is
[21:28] that okay all right brother brother
[21:31] Dale's talking about the horse forehead
[21:32] well yeah it's all of our ideas that we
[21:34] have we got to get rid of the
[21:36] denominationalism in our mind it's not
[21:39] in your soul
[21:40] well the denominational lives them
[21:42] wasn't in Martin Luther so we'll either
[21:45] because if he had the true baptism of
[21:48] the Holy Ghost that true baptism the
[21:49] whole goes never never spoke out of
[21:52] Luther's mouth that there was a Trinity
[21:57] but you and I have come to place that
[22:01] we're not looking at sinless perfection
[22:03] and but we're not also looking at the
[22:06] devil gonna beat us up all the time but
[22:08] you know what if you if you take the son
[22:10] of man take the Matthew Mark Luke and
[22:13] John and look at the things that with
[22:15] Jesus's life I was telling them in
[22:17] Sunday School class this morning he was
[22:19] so much man he was so much mantle they
[22:24] didn't believe who he was his humanity
[22:29] hid everything that whole the whole Old
[22:33] Testament that the priest lived by
[22:37] everyday they knew that word
[22:40] letter-by-letter and Jesus came exactly
[22:43] the way that the Old Testament said he
[22:46] didn't miss one scripture and they
[22:50] called him a devil
[22:53] they called him a demon they said you're
[22:56] a wine-bibber so he must have drunk a
[22:58] lot of wine you you what you sure don't
[23:01] hang around us Messi's believers
[23:10] where'd that come from you didn't hang
[23:14] around those message believers that
[23:16] really that's what they were saying
[23:17] you're not a Pharisee you're not a sad
[23:19] you see we can't put you anywhere so we
[23:21] just gonna make you a devil but he came
[23:24] exactly the way they said and you said
[23:25] well that's don't have anything to do
[23:26] that with the fifth seal yes it does
[23:28] because they were blinded the Jews were
[23:32] blinded so that we could come in they
[23:35] were blinded they had the Torah to the
[23:38] letter and Jesus came the exactly was
[23:41] supposed to but in his humanity because
[23:45] he didn't because he didn't go right up
[23:47] the Caiaphas and sake office I'm God and
[23:50] you're my partner you know Joe Caiaphas
[23:53] wanted a little bit of the credit
[23:54] conference was little he was a high
[23:56] priest and I believe you had a little
[23:57] head a little hot problem itself not
[24:00] that statue height but you know what I
[24:02] mean but because he was a high priest
[24:05] but because Jesus didn't come the way
[24:07] they thought it was they called him bill
[24:08] Zebub they're gonna do the same thing to
[24:10] you when we move into the son of man
[24:12] revelation the reason I'm bringing you
[24:14] this it's going to be something that the
[24:17] traditions that you've been brought up
[24:19] under and I've been brought up under has
[24:22] to be changed it has to be a totally
[24:27] different mindset than what we've ever
[24:33] experienced and you know what's going to
[24:35] happen they're going to call you
[24:38] belzebub they're gonna say you don't
[24:42] believe the message like we do praise
[24:46] God
[24:49] but that's what the seals are for folks
[24:51] that's the son of man revelation
[24:53] revelation we've never had before that's
[24:55] a revelation we got to come under that
[24:58] when brother Branham starts speaking of
[25:00] these things and speaking of the son of
[25:02] man and the son of man himself start
[25:04] speaking Matthew Mark Luke and John we
[25:07] must adhere to that not him to us so we
[25:12] must see what he's talking about you
[25:13] know I want to cover a couple of things
[25:15] number one
[25:17] even Jesus didn't have sinless
[25:19] perfection he learned by the things he
[25:23] he learned by the things he suffered and
[25:27] being made perfect thank you being made
[25:30] perfect I'm just reading the Bible right
[25:35] so let's get this thing you send this
[25:37] perfection thing out of the way it's
[25:41] like us me and brother Bob was talking
[25:42] you know you it's kind of it becomes if
[25:47] you need something God's gonna be there
[25:49] but if you go driving down the road in
[25:51] your car sitting on a and you drive by
[25:53] five service stations and you run out of
[25:57] gas and you say God why didn't you fill
[26:00] my tank he said I sent you five stations
[26:02] back in under I like what brother Brady
[26:07] said brother Brady said you know what
[26:08] we're all Christians we're all spiritual
[26:10] people but God give us five senses use
[26:12] them just because your motor blows up in
[26:16] your car you know it might mean it's got
[26:18] 400,000 miles on it I told the church
[26:21] they are downstairs this morning listen
[26:23] like it or not we're trapped in this
[26:26] first three dimension life light and
[26:28] matter we're trapped here we can't go
[26:30] into four four comes here we surely not
[26:33] going into five if you're born again and
[26:35] cinch
[26:36] you're just a place to hold him but in
[26:38] other words we can't we're stuck in one
[26:40] two and three all right so you know what
[26:42] if we need something God will supply our
[26:45] needs if you know even that brother
[26:48] Cleveland when he when he was giving his
[26:50] testimony about brother Branham praying
[26:52] for the his brakes or whatever that was
[26:56] it was it was the brakes or whatever it
[26:57] was it was going bad
[26:58] well now brother Cleveland didn't tell
[27:00] the whole story now he might have never
[27:03] put brakes on that till he sold it but
[27:04] I'll guarantee you the tires rested wore
[27:07] out I'll guarantee you he had to put all
[27:09] in the motor and he probably had to fill
[27:11] the gas tank up you see what God what
[27:14] we're talking about you said well if we
[27:15] are who we say we are then our car
[27:17] should be come on people please summer
[27:20] no church age brother Brown says the
[27:21] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[27:23] sign of God's disapproval neither are
[27:27] bright skies in Stillwater
[27:30] of his love and approval his approval of
[27:33] any of us it's only in the beloved his
[27:36] love is elective which he had for us
[27:40] before the foundation of the world
[27:42] does he love us yes but how shall we
[27:46] know we shall know because he said so he
[27:51] said so I said that's why and then I
[27:54] want to cover another thing we were
[27:56] talking to Bible study the point was
[27:57] brought up and I want to I want to go
[28:01] over this again because I may have made
[28:03] it a little bit strong but I want to
[28:07] read you what brother Brown said we're
[28:08] talking about laying on of hands and
[28:09] prayer lines I don't have a problem with
[28:11] prayer line if you need them
[28:15] but it's not the way it should be it is
[28:19] not the way it should be
[28:20] I'll prove it to you brother Bramson
[28:22] hebrews chapter six baptism laying on of
[28:25] hands even paul covers this paul covers
[28:27] laying on their hands and all these
[28:28] things get away move up go on to
[28:31] perfection that's what I'm telling you
[28:32] about the Son of Man our problem is is
[28:34] we get stuck in a rut we get stuck in
[28:37] our old beliefs that we have to have
[28:39] this we don't have to have this
[28:43] it's not even for us
[28:47] baptism Lent little hands that isn't
[28:50] perfect
[28:51] that's only carnal reform that brother
[28:55] brown calls the laying on of hands
[28:57] carnal reform and that's where the
[29:01] church leaves off today is on that
[29:04] carnal reform Wow Jesus Christ same
[29:08] yesterday day in there from 1958 there's
[29:10] very few people that are really come up
[29:12] and contacted by laying on of hands my
[29:14] ministry is not that now where did we
[29:17] get it from where do we get it from
[29:20] Pentecost my ministry is not that we
[29:25] realized that that's a great ministry
[29:27] because you can't take Leno hands out
[29:29] because it's in the Bible but the Bible
[29:31] says lay hands on the sick and they
[29:32] shall recover
[29:34] but ministry of laying on of hands was a
[29:38] Jewish son
[29:40] the roman centurion said just speak the
[29:43] word that's it the Gentile Jesus turned
[29:46] to said I haven't seen any faith in
[29:47] Israel just speak the word because what
[29:50] happened now bear this in mind that
[29:51] Roman knew that every sickness and
[29:53] disease was subject to his word now if
[29:56] we can realize the same it's all over
[30:03] see when you can realize the same that
[30:06] every demon every sickness every disease
[30:10] every fliction is subject to the Word of
[30:13] God just beat the word of my servant
[30:18] will get better
[30:19] 19:59 my new ministry now in the
[30:23] American people has been caught he said
[30:27] caught caught a Jewish custom of laying
[30:31] on of hands this is my new ministry in
[30:32] 1959 East 7 Los Angeles California
[30:36] that's not a Gentile custom everybody
[30:40] got that say Amen I'm just reading what
[30:43] he said the ministry has not been my
[30:46] ministry to lay hands on the sick it's
[30:49] not being it it's been to make by a
[30:52] divine gift to bring presents the Lord
[30:56] Jesus Christ in presence by discernment
[30:58] of Spirit which is called in the Bible a
[31:01] gift of knowledge and in doing so make
[31:03] him manifest before the people and then
[31:05] they receive him as their healer that
[31:07] settles it blind bartimaeus 1959 I want
[31:13] to speak to the audience just a moment
[31:15] my ministry is just a little later
[31:16] signed to the church than laying on of
[31:18] hands
[31:21] hmm laying on them hands was a Jewish
[31:24] custom when Jairus daughter was dying
[31:26] was dead Jairus said Jesus come lay your
[31:28] hands on them now we've had signs of
[31:31] laying on of hands all down through 2000
[31:34] years but now we're at the closing of
[31:37] the age it's something different now I'm
[31:41] telling you what the Prophet said it's
[31:43] something different now my ministry is
[31:46] through a spirit of discernment that it
[31:48] might manifest Jesus Christ presence
[31:50] that lamb that we are speaking of this
[31:52] been slain conferences with God 1959 now
[31:56] we've been preaching this week the
[31:58] Jewish custom for people in the Jewish
[32:00] time was to go way hands on the sick
[32:02] that's what they did everything was
[32:05] laying on of hands it was a Jewish order
[32:07] but it never was that way with the
[32:11] Gentiles never never all right let me
[32:17] read this last one right here let's
[32:18] watch this from here this is it is I be
[32:21] not afraid in 1960
[32:25] so we have America is full of Jewish
[32:27] believers the Jewish people had a custom
[32:30] of laying on him hands that never was to
[32:34] the Gentile Church that never was to the
[32:40] Gentile Church no sir it was for Jews
[32:43] alone but we've seen many great things
[32:47] happen that's why I'm telling you I will
[32:49] and I'll stand in the prayer line with
[32:51] anybody I'll pray for you up here I told
[32:53] them you know to brother Branham we
[32:54] don't like the quote and brother Ram
[32:56] says you get weaker every time you come
[32:57] to the pulpit every time you come to the
[32:59] altar you become weaker why because you
[33:01] depend on that one day you're not going
[33:04] to be able to find somebody and you
[33:05] better depend on what you got I was
[33:08] thinking today I said the greatest army
[33:10] was the one that was trained well before
[33:12] they got to the battle not wait until
[33:15] they got in the battle and figured out
[33:17] what was going on no they got trained
[33:18] before they got brother Don he didn't
[33:20] they didn't just then just stay here
[33:22] drive this tank drive it over there in
[33:24] that field and shoot somebody you'd have
[33:26] died quick right same way with the Word
[33:29] of God I believe what God is doing now
[33:30] for 50 something years he's been
[33:32] teaching us he's been training us and
[33:35] he's wanting us to what believe in your
[33:37] seat so when I said I didn't I didn't
[33:42] never said I didn't believe in prayer
[33:43] lines I said I just don't think they
[33:45] work like they're supposed to and I just
[33:47] proved to you they don't they don't work
[33:48] like they're supposed to even laying
[33:50] over hands nothing worked like he's
[33:51] supposed to he said that's a Jewish
[33:53] tradition alone you saw that not even
[33:56] for the Gentile Church we have developed
[33:58] it and you know what brother Branham
[34:00] remembering the third pull where the
[34:03] angel says brother Brown this is the
[34:05] third pull right but remember when he
[34:07] was talking about the fishing and he got
[34:08] the line all tangled up what did the
[34:11] angel tell him you've explained in other
[34:14] words you've explained this gift you got
[34:15] away you keep explaining it to the
[34:18] people he should have come out and said
[34:20] believe what I say and that's it because
[34:24] that's the Gentile way but what he had
[34:26] to deal with that Pentecostal like
[34:28] brother Dale was talking about they sold
[34:30] a Pentecostal doctrine brother Branham
[34:34] came out of that
[34:36] didn't stay in it he came out of it he
[34:40] was he was what was coming out of that
[34:42] Pentecostal idea but what happened a lot
[34:46] of that came with him and he allowed
[34:47] that he never wanted that he wanted it
[34:49] to work the way it was supposed to work
[34:51] he never wanted to have prayer lines he
[34:55] said that's not even his ministry's
[34:57] laying on hands so that's what I'm
[35:00] telling you we need to look at it
[35:03] different now if we're going to the son
[35:05] of man revelation then we're gonna see
[35:07] that Jesus just spoke the word even the
[35:12] Centurion said you just speak the word
[35:14] Lord and it'll happen we come to that
[35:16] and I'll guarantee you will come to a
[35:18] place we got to come to place nobody's
[35:20] ever come to before so why is why I'm
[35:24] like this if we're going in this
[35:26] direction and we get nowhere we're
[35:28] hitting that wall for fifty five years
[35:30] and the hole is open over here you know
[35:36] what we do as humans we keep going well
[35:39] it's kind of like to think what's
[35:40] insanity
[35:42] what's told what's the definition of
[35:45] total insanity it's doing the same thing
[35:47] over and over thinking you get a
[35:48] different results that's insanity but
[35:52] when the hole opens up over here when
[35:54] the son of man revelation opens up and
[35:56] we're supposed to go that way we need to
[35:58] go that way we need to start believing
[36:02] pray up before you get here and you may
[36:04] not need prayer for the city I'm talking
[36:08] to me two lane time I just you know one
[36:11] person I'm coming all of us if we come
[36:13] prayed up we might not need prayer right
[36:18] there by okay without me because really
[36:20] really I mean we got to come to a place
[36:23] to where all these other traditions
[36:26] tradition he called them traditions all
[36:29] these ideas that we had before sure God
[36:31] worked through them and winked at their
[36:33] ignorance but when we come to place of a
[36:34] body changed listen the prayer line was
[36:37] fine the prayer line would be lay hands
[36:39] on the sick and the people would have a
[36:40] great anointing and they would get
[36:42] healed but they're gonna die
[36:46] 99% of the people brother branham prayed
[36:48] for it in the meetings or probably
[36:50] already passed away physically dead so
[36:53] it didn't do them any good
[36:55] it just prolonged their life I'm talking
[37:00] about up that's right it's all we won't
[37:02] even tell what dick said that's all at
[37:04] 80 something years old that's all we
[37:05] won't anyhow just one more breath but
[37:09] what about a group of people though
[37:11] that's promised to come to a place to I
[37:14] was talking about this morning where
[37:15] brother Brian said limbs would be
[37:17] restored that you would speak the word
[37:20] and it would what pop now it didn't say
[37:23] every preacher it said you you say to
[37:28] this mountain it didn't say go to your
[37:29] priest or go to your preacher it says
[37:31] you say to this mountain be moved well
[37:33] you know what you got to move into
[37:34] something then that you don't put all
[37:36] your faith that's telling the church
[37:39] last night and this morning I believe it
[37:40] I like the way this church is set up
[37:42] because brother Del's he's not gonna
[37:44] patch you and pitch you and you know
[37:47] what that's good because you become a
[37:48] little bitty you're not it's strong in
[37:55] faith is you should be Aaron how'd you
[37:57] like that that good that better y'all
[37:59] thought I was gonna say something
[38:00] different in it but we're built the West
[38:04] sure we like brother Dale to pray for us
[38:06] because we know he's a man of God we
[38:07] know he can connect God but one can't
[38:09] you could it be God what if you can't
[38:11] get him one day I couldn't find him one
[38:16] day I couldn't find him you know why cuz
[38:18] I needed my priest to pray for me but
[38:22] you know what at that moment in time I
[38:25] needed to realize that God was dealing
[38:28] with me not dealing with him he wasn't
[38:31] dealing with me he wanted to talk to me
[38:33] brother Donny he won't talk to me
[38:34] through him he won't talk to me
[38:36] same way with you and I and see I
[38:40] believe that's what that's what the son
[38:42] of man revelation is the son of man
[38:43] revelation is is that Jesus Christ is
[38:46] here and he's in the form of the whole
[38:50] bride form of the whole bride you embody
[38:54] God
[38:57] and I got a quote I'll read later on
[38:59] we're brother Brennan well yeah we're
[39:02] brother round says you have enough power
[39:04] if you're born again to create a world
[39:06] and go live on it when you get born
[39:11] again it didn't say when you come up you
[39:13] know when you're wimping the headstone
[39:14] he said when you get born again you have
[39:16] inside of you the ability to co-create a
[39:19] world and go live on it he said what
[39:23] you're held by a bar which what these
[39:24] three dimensions and what the word says
[39:26] we got to wait till a certain time and
[39:28] then I believe you know when we get over
[39:30] to the other side create your world go
[39:33] live on it for a little while I I'll
[39:36] just be there if I want to go see you
[39:37] and what I mean gonna matter
[39:41] but listen our thought process should I
[39:43] hope and pray that our thought process
[39:46] is changing as we all ministering as we
[39:50] all come to this place of perfection
[39:51] that we see that it's not then that the
[39:55] blue skies is going to be the day that
[39:57] you get the greatest revelation or the
[40:01] gloomy days like spend the past three
[40:03] days is not a sign that God hates us
[40:06] it's just a sign that we're living in a
[40:09] perverse world that is what controlled
[40:12] by Satan he brought all that God didn't
[40:16] so we just got we can't do away with the
[40:23] situation we're in at the moment we
[40:26] can't do away with it we're locked into
[40:28] this but we can start from the inside
[40:31] and work our way out inside and work our
[40:35] way out and that's and that's we've
[40:37] already begin with all the material then
[40:38] we've already been given you know the
[40:41] the United States government wants to
[40:45] give their soldiers the best equipment
[40:50] now the United States don't build
[40:52] equipment to give to the Russians to
[40:54] kill us now that may happen but you
[40:56] don't want that to happen so why am I
[40:58] saying God didn't give the material to
[41:00] the devil doc didn't give his material
[41:02] to the Devils kids he give the material
[41:04] to you to give the material to me to
[41:08] what to understand what God's talking
[41:10] about
[41:10] and to realize that we've got to move
[41:12] from the horse forehead which is the NE
[41:18] denominational idea against that center
[41:20] part of the word of God
[41:22] you can't move one way or the other like
[41:27] bob was talking about you know you say
[41:29] well you gotta have balance really
[41:32] balance means you got that much weight
[41:34] on that side as you do on that side
[41:35] they ain't two sides of the word dead
[41:39] center there is a center pivot that we
[41:42] must come to we may have this idea over
[41:45] here and we may have this idea over here
[41:47] but that ain't violence the Word of God
[41:49] is what it is Jim jr. okay but I didn't
[41:57] throw anything you know I don't like
[41:59] that statement it is what it is I'm just
[42:00] kidding all right so let's get started
[42:03] so let's just review but I I want us to
[42:05] I want us to come come higher God tells
[42:09] us in the word come up higher come up
[42:11] here the revelations for come up hither
[42:13] in other words what John you got to come
[42:16] up and you got to go through that door
[42:18] remember there's the door open in heaven
[42:20] you got to go to that door well that's
[42:22] another dimension
[42:23] this right here happens in the three
[42:27] dimensions we live in this whole thing
[42:30] does but I'm going to show you something
[42:32] in a minute to get to this revelation of
[42:36] seal number five we got to go into
[42:38] another dimension
[42:42] not the fifth dimension we know where
[42:45] that's that but we got to go into
[42:47] another dimension to see this because
[42:48] John went into another dimension to see
[42:51] this Amen so we got and you know what
[42:55] we're gonna we remember we call this
[42:58] seal the grace seal ice telling them
[43:03] downstairs you know grace is unmerited
[43:05] favor right that's why you and I can't
[43:08] come up with grace you and I can't come
[43:11] up with the word grace and put a
[43:13] definition to it a human definition what
[43:15] you know why because we have this right
[43:17] here a list we make a list why this
[43:25] didn't happen while this person's this
[43:27] way while this person's that way
[43:29] that's not unmerited favor that's favor
[43:33] you do something to me I do something to
[43:36] you you've done something to me I don't
[43:37] have to do anything to you grace is not
[43:39] any of that if you did one thing to
[43:43] merit grace it's not grace it becomes
[43:45] works now your works as your faith
[43:48] expressed or you works as your grace
[43:50] expressed I know that but grace is
[43:53] unmerited favor now we're gonna get into
[43:56] that in the fifth seal so let's just
[43:58] review right here real quick now
[44:02] remember seal number one two three and
[44:04] four is everybody all right listen I'll
[44:08] do anything to further the kingdom of
[44:09] God but I don't want us to go backwards
[44:11] I don't want to go backwards going
[44:14] backwards is what backsliding backwards
[44:17] in God does never work go forward it
[44:22] doesn't matter if you move one grain of
[44:23] sand off that mountain move that one
[44:25] grain let that one grain roll off and
[44:29] believe what God's give us he's give us
[44:33] the Word of God and I believe he's give
[44:37] it to us in a progression that we can
[44:41] all progress now I just stay flat the
[44:44] whole time that we can progress and grow
[44:47] amen I just believe that if you don't
[44:50] then you need to find somewhere you
[44:51] where you can because we're the hours
[44:54] late
[44:55] we got to start growing up we got to
[44:57] start doing doing you know doing the
[45:01] they have the son of man mentality
[45:03] because that's what we're living under
[45:04] we're living under the son of man meant
[45:06] out we're living under the anointing of
[45:08] the Son of Man which was Jesus Christ
[45:11] walking on the earth among humanity
[45:15] right among humanity preaching the
[45:18] gospel done all right not to me that's
[45:21] percent that's pretty simple that's the
[45:24] son of man message all right still
[45:28] number one types the first Street Church
[45:29] age is still number two tops to fourth
[45:32] church age seal number three tops the
[45:34] next to church ages and seal number four
[45:36] types this is the layout of sin church
[45:39] age that looks kind of like Snoopy done
[45:41] that for those you that can see them and
[45:43] get that lawfully but that look
[45:45] most of you can't see it anyway so just
[45:47] laugh Julie just laugh Julie said I
[45:51] can't see that I said I'm a walk it just
[45:53] but then let you look at she
[45:55] don't want to let right Gary you'd be
[45:56] the one to go under the seat not you but
[46:01] I'm doing the best I can do all right so
[46:05] you got your there's your seven Church
[46:06] ages so in the seal one through four
[46:08] which is your wild horse your red horse
[46:10] your black horse and the pale horse is
[46:14] paralleled in the church ages everybody
[46:17] got that same am paralleled in the
[46:19] church ages the white righteous church
[46:22] wrote out in the first church age pure
[46:24] and unadulterated word they didn't have
[46:26] any denomination they sure they were
[46:28] sayings and things right but then Satan
[46:32] rides out with a white righteous church
[46:33] looking like the same then you come to
[46:36] the red which is red is what blood 68
[46:40] million people were killed right here
[46:42] because they were a Christian that's a
[46:45] lot of red all right then the black is
[46:48] in the man age which is your line ox man
[46:51] and eagle in the man age was the black
[46:54] horse rider and the black horse rider
[46:56] that was the blackness we can say the
[46:59] blackness of denominations because right
[47:02] in here is where denominations began to
[47:04] be set up now Luther didn't set up as a
[47:06] nomination Wesley did not set up a
[47:08] denominator
[47:08] they were denominated after they left
[47:11] after they died all right all right
[47:13] there was a Lutheran in a Westland and
[47:15] the Baptist started and all the ones
[47:16] will see that was that was a name they
[47:19] were living by but we're dead
[47:20] my brother Dale was talking about you
[47:23] know you got the seven women let us take
[47:25] your name but now we don't want to live
[47:27] with you we don't want to be intimate
[47:29] with you we just want your name we'll
[47:31] buy our own clothes we'll buy our own
[47:33] groceries we'll go wherever we want to
[47:34] go but we want to be called by your name
[47:36] and he's right you go and look outside
[47:39] any new church and even now I think
[47:42] blacks replacement is not Baptist Church
[47:45] anymore it's some kind of you got 12
[47:47] stone you got new River you've got
[47:50] Worship Center you got you don't hardly
[47:54] see any new Baptist Church pop-up or any
[47:56] new Methodist Church up maybe some
[47:57] Catholic churches do but most of them
[48:00] are worship centers well who's the god
[48:03] of worship the devil is the god of
[48:10] worship I'm sorry I'm just telling you
[48:13] what the point the Bible said it was the
[48:16] anointed cherub so what he's going to do
[48:19] is is hey don't put no don't put my name
[48:21] in there don't baptize in the name of
[48:25] Lord Jesus Christ right that's too much
[48:27] of my name in there you know or Satan
[48:29] saying no don't put too much in there
[48:31] you know but let's be a worship center
[48:32] and and truly it used to be in the
[48:36] Pentecostals where they would worship
[48:38] and they wouldn't even have a service
[48:39] because the the anointing was so strong
[48:41] well I had a baptist friend of mine just
[48:43] about five or six years ago he come in
[48:45] and said they had the most wonderful
[48:47] service Sunday they'd ever had in their
[48:49] life they worshiped for two and a half
[48:51] hours and had no preaching now that's
[48:55] not in the Bible there's a time for
[48:57] everything the word is always first okay
[49:00] so if you put everything in place it
[49:02] works perfect so you got the blackness
[49:05] of man that comes in and what it begins
[49:08] to denominator
[49:09] then you got your pale horse which is
[49:11] everything mixed together in this church
[49:14] age that's our church age right here
[49:16] where everything's mixed together all
[49:19] right now then we type justification
[49:22] sanctification
[49:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the
[49:24] Word made flesh and then we see now that
[49:27] in the coming up to the statue of a
[49:29] perfect man this is not baby form
[49:31] justification we're talking about in the
[49:32] seals we've come up a little bit higher
[49:34] we've come up a little bit higher is as
[49:37] if you never done it it wasn't you got
[49:39] your past sins dropped off but we are
[49:40] beginning to realize I hope you're
[49:43] beginning to realize that the real you
[49:45] didn't do it
[49:46] that motivating factor inside of you if
[49:49] you'll let it work it never sinned so
[49:52] let it work its way out it's as if you
[49:55] never done it then we're gonna get a
[49:57] little bit higher where the real you you
[49:58] got it when you seek really when you see
[50:00] grace you see that the real you never
[50:02] did it and this doesn't mean anything
[50:08] this doesn't mean anything you want me
[50:12] to prove it
[50:14] you mean to prove this doesn't mean
[50:16] anything again one more time the woman
[50:19] at the well she had she was polluted by
[50:24] five different men and was living with
[50:26] one she was polluted with that one you
[50:28] understand what I mean physically in her
[50:31] body she's gonna be in the bride
[50:36] so God cleaned her up inside wasn't
[50:40] worried about the outside now she didn't
[50:41] go do it no more but she was defiled
[50:45] that girl Rosella or whatever name was
[50:48] there brother brown prayed for us he was
[50:49] a prostitute she was a drunk she had
[50:51] give herself over to men she's gonna be
[50:54] a bride but now if a girl comes up and
[50:57] twenty year-old girl she's virgin never
[50:59] been touched by a man but if she don't
[51:00] give her heart to Jesus Christ she's
[51:01] going to hell right never been defiled
[51:07] you got the purest body that ever was
[51:09] never been defiled in her life but if
[51:12] she don't give her heart to Jesus Christ
[51:13] she's bound for hell why so that's the
[51:15] inside person so this inside person
[51:20] we're working the inside out we come up
[51:23] here now we look at st. duplication
[51:25] which is to meet that sanctification to
[51:27] a higher level God sanctifies you what
[51:31] he cleans you and set you aside for
[51:33] service well what's he doing here he's
[51:34] burning the trash out
[51:36] to set you aside for service then
[51:41] adoption we come to the baptism of Holy
[51:44] Ghost we come to the top effective
[51:45] pyramid and we see now death is
[51:48] destroyed in the body change has to take
[51:50] place in this fourth seal when it opens
[51:53] death is destroyed
[51:55] why is death destroyed because we take a
[52:00] body change and a catching away right
[52:03] here so we must know that all this
[52:07] happens during this time so when you got
[52:10] pale horses everything mixed together
[52:12] the Word made flesh death destroyed the
[52:16] actually listen folks in in the bride
[52:20] not only death is destroyed but that
[52:23] Antichrist spirits destroyed in you the
[52:29] horse forehead all those things we're
[52:31] talking about that's destroyed in you
[52:33] that's destroyed by the brightness of
[52:36] his coming and the coming of the Lord is
[52:38] what the revealing of his word then this
[52:40] last age oh let's get this this is us
[52:46] put your name right there wherever you
[52:51] are put your name right there
[52:55] cuz if you'll put your name right there
[52:57] then God can work with you put yourself
[53:01] in a position make yourself available
[53:02] that God is going to make your flesh the
[53:08] word not just n-type not just like I
[53:15] said like Sunday night that's not here
[53:17] say it has been here safe for 2,000
[53:21] years we've heard a lot of hearsay
[53:23] remember we've heard a lot of hearsay
[53:27] Mama's walking the streets to go with
[53:29] Jesus today no she's not but remember
[53:32] like I said we're not going out and
[53:33] telling people this but we know that we
[53:36] know about the Alpha knees and we know
[53:38] about the white robes and we know about
[53:40] the position that everything goes into
[53:42] and how the death is destroyed in us in
[53:46] us we are the ones that destroy death by
[53:54] what by the revealing of the word not by
[53:57] kernel reform our carnal impersonation
[54:03] that all right so now there's the first
[54:09] four seals we've been thrilled it took
[54:12] us about a half a year or maybe three
[54:13] quarters but now we're on the
[54:15] homestretch
[54:16] because we have to lap this back under
[54:19] here to bring in steel five because
[54:22] remember steel five is white robes were
[54:24] given to those that were Jews that God
[54:26] blinded their eyes right so you would
[54:28] think that would have nothing to do with
[54:29] us but it really does and we'll cover in
[54:31] just a little while and then your sixth
[54:33] seal is definitely to the Jews it's over
[54:36] hearing that last 70 at 70th week of the
[54:38] danger 70 weeks right amen
[54:40] so that's the two prophets the two
[54:42] prophets brother Branham identified the
[54:43] two prophets as that seal the sixth seal
[54:46] is those two prophets right all right
[54:48] and then the seventh seal brother
[54:49] Branham said the seventh seal brings you
[54:51] back to earth well he's going out to
[54:52] come back to earth with us first he's
[54:55] got to come back to earth and ice first
[54:58] then he comes in what fights for the
[55:02] Jews remember revelation 12 Michael
[55:05] comes down I mean story Daniel can
[55:08] twelve where Michael comes down and
[55:10] fights for the Jews coming into the
[55:12] Battle of Armageddon that's what the
[55:14] Bible says all right so the Seventh Seal
[55:18] brings him back to earth the Seventh
[55:19] Seal to you and me brings him back to
[55:21] earth earth our earth Bodhi earth or
[55:26] earth
[55:27] I don't everything when I think of God
[55:29] doing something on earth or in earth
[55:31] I don't think of this ball that we're
[55:33] living over we are the earth where the
[55:38] earth you know what I believe Adam said
[55:47] when God put Adam in that human body
[55:49] I believe Adam looked and said man if if
[55:53] this earth then I own the whole thing
[55:57] I'm standing on I'm a recipient of what
[56:01] I'm standing on what I'm standing on is
[56:04] earth and I've been mater that's what
[56:07] you and I you and I yes the whole thing
[56:11] alright let's go let's read a few things
[56:13] here mmm everybody all right
[56:16] I don't want to sound harsh but I want
[56:19] us to shake ourselves
[56:21] get out of that you know that mentality
[56:25] that we used to have all right let's
[56:29] read number one because we must realize
[56:36] and remember now see that they're from
[56:37] brother branham comes to this fifth seal
[56:39] now remember every seal if you'll read
[56:41] them brother branham said I had my view
[56:43] on it but I had to change it okay
[56:47] I had my view on it but I had to change
[56:49] it I had my view had my view and he had
[56:51] his view on this one on the fifth seal
[56:54] he thought that was the souls of the
[56:56] church under the altar cried how long
[56:59] how long right but it wasn't it was the
[57:04] Jews that were given white robes so
[57:06] let's read a few things right here on
[57:08] the fifth seal Lamb of God come forward
[57:09] we Prague we call on you Lord the great
[57:12] Redeemer so see we still have to put
[57:17] this under the plan of redemption
[57:19] we have to put this under the plan of
[57:21] redemption you can't say well what now
[57:25] we're look redemption is over really
[57:28] come redemptions over know it you got a
[57:31] lap that thing back and redemption won't
[57:35] be over until this guy comes in you that
[57:40] okay that's too strong swallow that
[57:46] comes that's you we're going to see when
[57:50] we get to the seventh seal the seventh
[57:52] seal is you you are it you are it but
[57:59] come forth and show us your plan of
[58:00] redemption that's been hit through the
[58:01] years breaking this fifth seal for us
[58:05] tonight and reveal what's beneath that
[58:07] seal for us that we might go away a
[58:09] better Christian than we are now might
[58:11] be better fit for the task that lays
[58:13] ahead we ask in Jesus name Amen
[58:15] number two fifth seal paragraph 25 well
[58:19] now I get startling in subjects we just
[58:20] talked on and the people around the
[58:21] walls sitting standing so I'll get right
[58:24] straight to the message and I want to
[58:26] say this now I want to give thanks to
[58:27] him whose omnipresent and that today not
[58:30] knowing one thing about that fifth seal
[58:32] it came in that same mysterious way this
[58:35] morning just about an hour before
[58:36] daybreak when I was out praying okay so
[58:40] it was a mystery to him okay now let's
[58:44] go number three fifth seal paragraph 40
[58:46] now this is rather a mysterious now for
[58:48] the sake of tapes and clergyman and
[58:50] teachers that sitting president now if
[58:52] you have a different view from this I
[58:53] did too but I'm just taking it from the
[58:57] inspiration which completely changed my
[58:59] view of it see all right so it changed
[59:02] his view of it so if it changed a view
[59:04] of a prophet why wouldn't it change our
[59:07] view if it changed the view of the
[59:11] Prophet in the end time if I got that
[59:15] because remember it was God and brother
[59:17] branham they wasn't nobody in between
[59:18] there's nobody you can insert but will
[59:21] come under our prophet messenger with
[59:23] the final boys to the final age right so
[59:27] I'm telling you what he said he it
[59:28] changed his view of it
[59:31] in other words let me paraphrase he said
[59:33] the Bible became a brand new book it
[59:35] should come to become a brand new book
[59:37] to us don't read it with carnal reform
[59:41] don't read it with the horse forehead
[59:43] read it with total understanding now
[59:45] we've all had to understand you but we
[59:47] want to have a hundred percent
[59:48] understanding fifth seal nineteen I mean
[59:53] paragraph 69 now notice there's no
[59:56] mention of another beast or a living
[59:57] creature to this announcement of the
[59:59] fifth seal now remember there was on the
[1:00:01] 4th there was on the first second third
[1:00:03] and fourth but none here all right so
[1:00:06] what's that the combat beast that's the
[1:00:07] Holy Ghost all right in the people in
[1:00:10] the Gentile church age their bow right
[1:00:13] with that now a number of paragraph 83
[1:00:16] number five now notice I love this as in
[1:00:19] the times of the right of the four
[1:00:20] horses the rider singular of the four
[1:00:22] different horses there was a beast that
[1:00:24] announced the power every time the right
[1:00:27] riders straddled another horse and come
[1:00:29] forth to ride another kind of beast come
[1:00:31] out and announced it that's a great
[1:00:33] mystery that see that is the mystery why
[1:00:36] announcing the mystery why isn't there
[1:00:38] one on this fifth seal to announce it
[1:00:40] here it is according to the revelation
[1:00:42] of the Lord Jesus give me today or this
[1:00:45] morning early that is what the mystery
[1:00:48] of the church ages are already finished
[1:00:50] at this time the mystery of the
[1:00:54] Antichrist is revealed at this time the
[1:00:57] Antichrist took his last ride and we
[1:00:59] find him on the pale horse mixed with
[1:01:00] many colors and rides all the way into
[1:01:03] perdition now let's skip the paragraph
[1:01:05] 87 but the reason that he reveals that I
[1:01:08] as I understand that it is because the
[1:01:11] mystery of the book of Redemption he's
[1:01:13] still talking about the seals being the
[1:01:16] book of redemption whose redemption
[1:01:18] yours and mine
[1:01:21] not Israel not the world you and me
[1:01:27] as far as the Antichrist being revealed
[1:01:30] and at the same time the church is gone
[1:01:32] and these things don't even happen in
[1:01:34] the church a church age at all that's
[1:01:36] right there away from the church age the
[1:01:40] church absolutely is raptured at this
[1:01:42] time the church goes up in the fourth
[1:01:44] chapter revelation and it does not
[1:01:46] return until it comes back with its king
[1:01:47] in the nineteenth chapter but these
[1:01:49] seals here are revealing what has been
[1:01:52] what is and what will be see and now
[1:01:56] what was to be for the church ages was
[1:01:58] revealed by these seals and now watch
[1:02:01] what takes place the four stages of his
[1:02:03] rider has been revealed the four stages
[1:02:06] of the Antichrist rider riding has been
[1:02:09] revealed at this time therefore they
[1:02:10] don't have to have any more any more
[1:02:12] what any more combat beasts and there
[1:02:16] was four living creatures of God to
[1:02:18] announce the rider as they rode four
[1:02:19] beasts are four powers so the Raptors
[1:02:23] took place we know that but that's what
[1:02:25] I'm telling you
[1:02:26] the first four seals if you if we if we
[1:02:29] parallel them with the church ages
[1:02:30] that's in this time element life light
[1:02:33] and matter John and when the first Hill
[1:02:41] open the first beast said John come and
[1:02:45] see they were standing in them in the
[1:02:47] dimension John was in but now the fifth
[1:02:50] dimension he's got to be away from all
[1:02:53] this it's got to be in another dimension
[1:02:58] our thoughts have got to come from
[1:03:00] another dimension because like I said
[1:03:03] you can't you can't take this you can't
[1:03:06] take this capstone grace and give it to
[1:03:09] anybody it's got to come from Almighty
[1:03:12] God Himself everybody all right with
[1:03:14] that all right now look now watch number
[1:03:19] six now notice now in the ninth verse
[1:03:22] souls under the altar now here's where
[1:03:24] I'm going to get some real disagreement
[1:03:26] but just watch for a minute think about
[1:03:30] brother Branham think about a man when
[1:03:32] he thought when he says on the seals
[1:03:33] you're not getting it of course he's not
[1:03:35] said it yet but he's fixing to say it on
[1:03:37] the question and that's on the seals but
[1:03:39] when he come into his son
[1:03:40] man ministry I'm not talking about
[1:03:43] hundreds I'm talking about thousands and
[1:03:45] maybe hundreds of thousands of people
[1:03:46] kicked him out right and when he
[1:03:52] preached mayor's in divorce he said
[1:03:54] thousands of my friends will walk away
[1:03:55] from me so he just in other words he
[1:03:57] here we go if he is what he says he is
[1:04:01] he ought to been the most popular
[1:04:02] prophet in the world Rob to the day he
[1:04:04] died
[1:04:04] no he go he didn't get worse but what
[1:04:08] his following got worse and worse and
[1:04:10] worse to where he preached the rapture
[1:04:13] message to twenty something people in a
[1:04:16] trailer that they were having a
[1:04:18] community in Arizona because they went
[1:04:20] out there to be together so they could
[1:04:22] be a brand of mine that's what they were
[1:04:25] twenty something people where he would
[1:04:27] preach to fifty thousand or he'd have
[1:04:28] five thousand in a in a in a tent but
[1:04:34] see watch he had to change his thought
[1:04:35] though but you know what it never ever
[1:04:37] discouraged him sure in his humanity he
[1:04:40] got discouraged but you never saw it on
[1:04:43] the outside you never saw it and you
[1:04:46] know he didn't woke up after the seals
[1:04:47] he goes now y'all bless God yeah
[1:04:49] yeah ain't nobody coming to visit me no
[1:04:51] more and ain't nobody coming to see me I
[1:04:53] think I'm just gonna know he preached
[1:04:55] right on just like nothing happened he
[1:04:57] preached 224 like he preached to 24,000
[1:05:00] you know why cuz he had a message to
[1:05:02] bring and knowing that nobody in that
[1:05:04] building that was sitting there at the
[1:05:06] time would probably be alive when it
[1:05:08] become manifest
[1:05:12] knowing that another group was coming
[1:05:15] your that group your the group if
[1:05:19] there's any of these and brother Brown
[1:05:20] head of a group of people who's gonna
[1:05:22] make it it was the people sitting in
[1:05:23] front of me today you and me
[1:05:25] they don't excite you but I bet I guess
[1:05:27] it must put you to sleep y'all have
[1:05:29] Turkey for lunch today
[1:05:30] I thought now notice not a nice verse
[1:05:41] older than the altar now here's what I'm
[1:05:42] gonna get some real disagreement but
[1:05:45] just watch a minute I thought that too
[1:05:47] but it didn't come that way there was
[1:05:49] our thought process that his whole
[1:05:51] thought process had to be turned you
[1:05:55] know why so it could turn mine and yours
[1:05:58] or we wouldn't went right on in the same
[1:06:01] way
[1:06:01] loping right along but no God come to us
[1:06:06] in the form of a prophet told us the way
[1:06:09] and then he didn't leave he come right
[1:06:11] back into the message when I say message
[1:06:17] do you think these this when I say
[1:06:22] message how many of you think of books
[1:06:24] and tapes
[1:06:26] it ain't books and tapes it's you it's
[1:06:33] you you're the living message see that
[1:06:39] live it don't you listen don't walk with
[1:06:42] your head stuck up because I'll promise
[1:06:44] you look as much rain as we're having a
[1:06:46] lot of your dream but if you walk humble
[1:06:51] that God showed it to you and not fifty
[1:06:56] million other people in the world he
[1:06:58] showed it to you he give it to you it's
[1:07:01] your message you are the books in the
[1:07:04] tapes because look rapture and faith
[1:07:06] lies in the books and tapes well there's
[1:07:09] the books and tapes gonna take a rapture
[1:07:12] so what is he talking about
[1:07:14] if rapture and faith lies in the books
[1:07:17] and the tapes rap from faith lies in me
[1:07:19] and you I thought that too but it didn't
[1:07:24] come that way
[1:07:25] I've always thought that these souls
[1:07:27] under the altar look he's going to one
[1:07:29] direction we're the martyrs of the early
[1:07:31] church and I'm sure that dr. your R
[1:07:35] Smith and every one of them says it is C
[1:07:37] but I thought so myself but when the
[1:07:41] Holy Spirit showed division to it it
[1:07:44] wasn't it isn't the souls now now you
[1:07:47] say well I don't know about that well
[1:07:48] now wait a minute
[1:07:49] we'll find out these are not the souls
[1:07:52] of the bride Church waiting their souls
[1:07:58] under the altar you see crying how long
[1:07:59] Lord how long let me read it again then
[1:08:03] you read open when it opened v else on
[1:08:05] the altar the souls of them that were
[1:08:07] slain for the word of God and for the
[1:08:09] testimony which they held and then we'll
[1:08:11] cover that later on I'm just going to
[1:08:13] try to cover the whole top of it then
[1:08:15] get started next Sunday into the depth
[1:08:17] of the revelation see the Word of God
[1:08:19] and the testimony which they held now
[1:08:22] see it wasn't the testimony of Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ
[1:08:24] it was the testimony they held all right
[1:08:28] we'll read some scripture which talks
[1:08:30] about the testimony of Jesus Christ they
[1:08:32] didn't have the testimony of Jesus
[1:08:33] Christ these souls under the altar
[1:08:35] didn't even know who Jesus Christ was
[1:08:36] right all right and they cried how long
[1:08:41] Lord how long holy and true dust our
[1:08:43] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[1:08:44] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[1:08:46] given to every one of them and it was
[1:08:47] said to them but they should rest yet
[1:08:48] for a little season until their
[1:08:49] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[1:08:52] so it's got to be then somebody alive on
[1:08:56] this side and the ones dead on this side
[1:08:58] that are brethren so they got to be of
[1:09:00] the same nationality well it's going to
[1:09:05] be the same nationality they should rest
[1:09:08] for a little season until their
[1:09:09] fellow-servants also in brethren that
[1:09:10] should be killed as they were should be
[1:09:14] fulfilled now for they at this time now
[1:09:17] that was the scripture now he's this is
[1:09:19] his quote if you notice this fifth seal
[1:09:21] being open see the church is gone so it
[1:09:26] can't be it just can't be the souls
[1:09:30] under the early church he's talking
[1:09:32] about he's talking about born again he
[1:09:35] was actually putting this fifth seal
[1:09:38] group of people in the sixth dimension
[1:09:43] because he thought it was the Saints
[1:09:45] that had went on even after he went
[1:09:51] behind the curtain of time and so I'm
[1:09:52] standing there thought about that huh
[1:09:58] this is after he went he went behind
[1:10:00] coming onto curtain time in 1960 this is
[1:10:02] 1963 he still had that same view when he
[1:10:07] saw the ones and will read it in just a
[1:10:09] minute I got something I want to show
[1:10:10] you now please if you ever did give this
[1:10:12] attention now because this is a great
[1:10:14] controversy so I want you to listen real
[1:10:16] close and you've got your papers and
[1:10:18] things too right now I want you to
[1:10:19] notice now these cannot be themselves
[1:10:20] but them soul the righteous church
[1:10:23] because the souls of the righteous
[1:10:25] martyred and the righteous people the
[1:10:27] church the bride has done been took up
[1:10:29] in other words they've already got their
[1:10:31] glorified body they're not standing in
[1:10:32] white robes somewhere they're in their
[1:10:34] glorified wearing our glorified body and
[1:10:36] worried at the wedding supper people
[1:10:40] with flesh on them right okay
[1:10:45] maybe it's a lot to process they cannot
[1:10:49] be these souls because the souls of the
[1:10:51] righteous martyred and the righteous
[1:10:52] people the church the bride has done
[1:10:54] been took up so they wouldn't be under
[1:10:56] the altar
[1:10:59] now let me explain to you a minute I
[1:11:01] tried to find how brother branham
[1:11:03] explained exactly under the altar pretty
[1:11:05] much the way I see it because I can't
[1:11:06] get enough quotes to to put anything
[1:11:09] together it's just like he said there's
[1:11:14] a there's a bar there that they can't
[1:11:15] get to Jesus Christ so there under the
[1:11:18] altar of God brother Brahim explains at
[1:11:22] one time that Jesus has you know member
[1:11:24] his body is at the right hand of God
[1:11:26] forever making intercession and
[1:11:28] everybody's underneath that that's the
[1:11:30] altar there's not an altar there with a
[1:11:32] bunch of people at the altar no it's
[1:11:35] just there in a holding place that
[1:11:37] there's a cap over that holding place
[1:11:38] that they can't get no further at the
[1:11:41] time their bow right with that so that
[1:11:44] souls under the altar okay they're not
[1:11:47] under an altar somewhere it's a it's a
[1:11:50] it's a metaphor that they're under what
[1:11:52] the sacrifice of Jesus Christ laying on
[1:11:55] the altar and they can see there's one
[1:11:57] quote where they says he can stake and
[1:11:59] see the sacrifice I don't know other
[1:12:01] things see it physically I don't know I
[1:12:02] ain't gonna argue with it but in other
[1:12:04] words that's what that altars for
[1:12:05] there's an altar of sacrifice and the
[1:12:07] blood of Jesus Christ in and the the
[1:12:11] body remember brother Brown said the
[1:12:12] bodies up there laying on the altar what
[1:12:15] ain't laying there on the altar like
[1:12:16] this lifeless we understand it's a
[1:12:18] position Jesus was at the right hand of
[1:12:21] the Father he's not standing at the
[1:12:23] right hand of a man he's the power and
[1:12:26] authority all right there by okay
[1:12:29] without so you like to look at these
[1:12:31] metaphors you have to look at these
[1:12:32] examples so they're under the altar when
[1:12:34] I look the sixth seal right now to m60
[1:12:38] oh the sixth dimension is under the
[1:12:41] altar when brother Branham went across
[1:12:44] the curtain of time what did the guy say
[1:12:46] the guy said these are souls under the
[1:12:48] altar not them not the fifth seal Jew
[1:12:54] not to fish he'll know it was souls
[1:12:57] under the altar in the sixth dimension
[1:12:58] killed he said where's Jesus he said
[1:13:00] he's higher you can't get to him at the
[1:13:02] time in other words you're right here in
[1:13:03] a holding place all right so he
[1:13:06] separated its church the bride has done
[1:13:08] gone see the six seals I I mean the six
[1:13:10] when I say six sealed
[1:13:12] that's the sixth dimension the six
[1:13:14] dimension is emptied out right here it's
[1:13:20] empty there's nobody in the sixth
[1:13:22] dimension because that is the bride of
[1:13:24] the 2000 year church age they've done
[1:13:28] come back that's been destroyed they've
[1:13:30] took a body change it we're somewhere in
[1:13:32] another dimension at a wedding supper so
[1:13:36] it's not those people about okay with
[1:13:42] that they'd be in glory with the bright
[1:13:45] notes that has done been took up so they
[1:13:46] wouldn't be under the altar they'd been
[1:13:49] in glory with the bride because remember
[1:13:51] Jesus Christ is the only one that's
[1:13:52] reaching immortality
[1:13:53] he's right here all the sixth dimension
[1:13:56] is under here but when they come back
[1:13:58] here and get their bodies remember what
[1:14:00] they told brother Brown we don't eat
[1:14:01] here but when we come back we're longing
[1:14:05] to come back to get our bodies so that
[1:14:07] we can what be human again because they
[1:14:13] don't have flesh bodies over there
[1:14:16] they're not theophany now you can say
[1:14:20] well there's a flesh body that's okay I
[1:14:21] don't care but it ain't that body to eat
[1:14:23] because they said we don't eat here okay
[1:14:26] for they are gone in the rapture in the
[1:14:30] fourth chapter of Revelation so the six
[1:14:32] dimensions been cleared out so there is
[1:14:34] no souls under that altar so they're
[1:14:37] gone therefore this must be a different
[1:14:40] set of people okay let's go to the next
[1:14:44] one please
[1:14:45] so in other words to see this open we
[1:14:49] must enter into another dimension to see
[1:14:52] this seal open because what did John see
[1:14:55] he saw theophanies he was in the spirit
[1:14:59] realm that okay with that you and I must
[1:15:07] enter another dimension of thought
[1:15:09] process
[1:15:14] if you still think what you're thinking
[1:15:17] now that's what's got us we're at right
[1:15:18] now
[1:15:24] is that okay we must enter another
[1:15:28] dimension of thought listen I've already
[1:15:31] said you don't get a revelation in this
[1:15:32] dimension this dimension is not even so
[1:15:35] this dimension shouldn't even been here
[1:15:38] hello it should not it was permitted
[1:15:43] when time began because life light and
[1:15:46] matter or time brother Brennan puts in
[1:15:48] there is what these three dimensions are
[1:15:49] for that we're called in now they'll
[1:15:52] come with that and our problem is as we
[1:15:56] lean toward that and not the spirit
[1:15:57] realm because truly there are other
[1:15:59] dimensions and like brother Dale said
[1:16:02] there's that there's an angel standing
[1:16:03] right here with me now there's an angel
[1:16:06] sitting right there with you right now
[1:16:10] when you get up walk out that door if
[1:16:12] you're a born-again believer there's an
[1:16:14] angel with you you're sitting in the car
[1:16:16] there's an angel with you why that's a
[1:16:18] spirit realm brother brown said one time
[1:16:21] he said oh Lord
[1:16:23] he said break back their eyes so they
[1:16:25] can see angels satin on the banister
[1:16:28] setting on the where add the pilaster in
[1:16:32] other words sitting in other words if
[1:16:34] what did Elijah do well I just said man
[1:16:37] Gaza said we're looked because guy hazel
[1:16:45] was in this 1 2 & 3 dimension God let
[1:16:48] Elijah being a prophet seeing another
[1:16:50] dimension and he says there's more force
[1:16:52] than there are them and haze' goes one
[1:16:59] two one two fifty thousand twenty
[1:17:02] thousand fifteen thousand the largest
[1:17:04] like we got a million angels over here
[1:17:07] there's a me he said Lord open thy
[1:17:09] servants eyes and he said what he saw a
[1:17:13] ring of angels all the way around the
[1:17:17] camp well hey they're there for me and
[1:17:21] you if they were there for them they got
[1:17:24] to be there for us
[1:17:28] but remember we're not angels and angels
[1:17:32] are not human
[1:17:35] we are theophanies we are born again
[1:17:40] word made flesh
[1:17:41] this is the theophany of God inside of
[1:17:44] this guy you're looking at today in the
[1:17:46] same way without any of you it's the
[1:17:48] theophany of God down inside of this
[1:17:50] thing right here it's not an angel I'm
[1:17:52] not going to an angel they're not going
[1:17:53] to an angel and he's in the fifth
[1:17:55] dimension or not angels they're people
[1:17:59] souls
[1:18:00] it says souls under the altar so we must
[1:18:04] then change our thought process entering
[1:18:08] in another dimension but watch what's
[1:18:11] what brother Branham had and we'll
[1:18:13] finish this and be done for this time
[1:18:15] I'll save a few but let's go to the next
[1:18:18] quote here's what brother Branham of
[1:18:20] thought before he went across the
[1:18:22] curtain of time all right so this is
[1:18:25] this is a pre-1960 this is 1953 I can't
[1:18:29] touch brother Neville in there because
[1:18:31] John saw them they were souls under the
[1:18:34] altar crying how long now brother
[1:18:36] Branham is going to the fifth seal John
[1:18:40] saw them their souls under the altar
[1:18:41] crying how long Lord how long you know
[1:18:43] why we went through revelations and how
[1:18:45] that in there they desire to return and
[1:18:47] be clothed upon with mortal bodies they
[1:18:49] were crying how long now they knew each
[1:18:51] other but they couldn't talk and shake
[1:18:53] hands or I beg your pardon
[1:18:54] the Lord stopped him he said I beg your
[1:18:57] pardon they could talk because they said
[1:18:59] how long but they couldn't shake hands
[1:19:02] and so forth
[1:19:04] and we know that's not true but remember
[1:19:07] the old thought process that we had
[1:19:09] playing hearts Casper the Friendly Ghost
[1:19:12] that can move through the walls and move
[1:19:14] through you and he would say me and
[1:19:16] brother never walk by and said we
[1:19:17] couldn't shake hands because there was
[1:19:19] nothing there but when we die when we
[1:19:22] die now we go directly into the presence
[1:19:24] of Almighty God in a celestial body if I
[1:19:28] would meet brother Neville up there if I
[1:19:30] died both died now in an hour from now
[1:19:32] I'd meet him I say greetings brother
[1:19:33] Neville talk to him I couldn't show you
[1:19:35] them now that's the prophets idea that's
[1:19:38] his revelation he gets an updated
[1:19:41] revelation a few years later but that's
[1:19:43] his revelation of what it is because you
[1:19:45] know what that's the old thought that
[1:19:47] were spirits floating back and forth I
[1:19:51] could not shake his hand he's in a
[1:19:54] celestial body I could talk to him he'd
[1:19:57] looked just like he does there I'd look
[1:19:59] like I do but we could talk to one
[1:20:01] another but we couldn't touch one
[1:20:03] another because we haven't got any of
[1:20:05] the five senses of see stay still
[1:20:07] smelling here Wow hmm Alice he's going
[1:20:14] to change in about seven years ago God's
[1:20:15] gonna send him across the curtain time
[1:20:18] all right there okay so now let's look
[1:20:20] at the curtains time
[1:20:22] ghostly just go back up keep going this
[1:20:25] is where brother Branham explains this
[1:20:27] is even in 1965 so I wanted to get an
[1:20:30] updated as as late as I could get not
[1:20:33] just the 1960 version and it helped me
[1:20:37] because I used to have an idea when a
[1:20:38] person died just their soul went off but
[1:20:41] he Quinn he quoted that to me if they
[1:20:42] search the tabernacle her habitation
[1:20:44] beat we already have one see we got to
[1:20:46] have everything in threes to make
[1:20:47] perfection seeing there's one body here
[1:20:50] and that body which is the celestial
[1:20:52] body then the glorified body in the
[1:20:54] resurrection see that makes it complete
[1:20:55] the body here the celestial body in the
[1:20:58] body and the resurrection that's the
[1:20:59] three there buddy got that say ma'am all
[1:21:02] right wake up for just a minute see that
[1:21:05] makes it complete it's not a myth it's
[1:21:07] not an idea it's not a spirit it's a man
[1:21:12] and woman like you are just exactly and
[1:21:14] then years ago I've seen the regions of
[1:21:17] the law
[1:21:17] then was there I tell you friend as an
[1:21:19] old man let me persuade you this across
[1:21:21] the nation this morning don't never want
[1:21:23] to view that place there's no way at all
[1:21:25] that I could if I was an artist with a
[1:21:27] brush I couldn't paint the picture as a
[1:21:29] minister I couldn't describe do you talk
[1:21:31] about Hell being a burning place it'd be
[1:21:33] a million times worse than that the
[1:21:35] horrors that goes with it in heaven or
[1:21:38] this place wherever it was I don't know
[1:21:40] what to call it he referred to it there
[1:21:42] as souls under the altar but when it was
[1:21:45] I have never there's no way to explain
[1:21:47] how great it is there is now you just
[1:21:50] have to take my words I'm just a man
[1:21:53] but these tell about the vision is
[1:21:54] always coming too fast keep going now
[1:22:01] here he is he asked him he says I said
[1:22:04] do you eat he said not here we don't eat
[1:22:07] here but when we go back to earth will
[1:22:09] receive a body we eat in well I could
[1:22:12] feel them now that's totally contrary to
[1:22:14] what he was thinking before I could feel
[1:22:17] them they was just like that see and I
[1:22:20] said well you have oh yes they have a
[1:22:22] body just not a myth it's a body we knew
[1:22:26] we know one another they all knowed me
[1:22:28] was hugging me millions of them and I
[1:22:31] said I want to see the one that brought
[1:22:32] me here says you can't see him you have
[1:22:35] to wait why did you put me they said
[1:22:37] you're a leader on earth do you mean all
[1:22:39] these are Brandan's he said no they're
[1:22:41] your convert so I looked around then it
[1:22:43] hard night the trials passed away when I
[1:22:45] could see their face a young woman run
[1:22:47] up there and one of the most beautiful
[1:22:48] women she throws her arms around me said
[1:22:50] precious brother and when she passed by
[1:22:52] now she was a woman but in there there's
[1:22:54] never be sin see our glands were changed
[1:22:56] there they won't raise children no more
[1:22:58] there see all the same so what it was in
[1:23:00] other words when he hugged her he knew
[1:23:01] she was a woman that's how real that
[1:23:03] person was that's how real these people
[1:23:06] are in the fifth dimension but you got
[1:23:08] to separate the two you can't put on the
[1:23:11] same they're totally separate because
[1:23:14] these are given white robes we get our
[1:23:18] white robe we've already got them own if
[1:23:20] we're born again you've got the
[1:23:22] righteousness of God in your soul right
[1:23:25] now if you're born again you don't go
[1:23:28] get it in another dimension the only way
[1:23:30] you're gonna get
[1:23:31] something in another dimension is is you
[1:23:32] gonna hope your foolish version you
[1:23:36] gonna hold a cup of white Saul I hope
[1:23:38] but if you got it now see we take our
[1:23:42] robes with us this group gets white
[1:23:45] ropes that makes the difference of the
[1:23:47] two these this group of people are not
[1:23:50] born again this group this group that
[1:23:55] group he's talking about is alright now
[1:23:59] let's look at number nine and then we'll
[1:24:01] close right here and then then we'll
[1:24:02] start on the we'll get into the
[1:24:04] specifics of all the where we're going
[1:24:07] what we're doing now look now this is
[1:24:10] 1961 this is after this is after he went
[1:24:17] across the curtain of time but now the
[1:24:20] steel hadn't broke to show the two
[1:24:22] differences but he's gonna watch what
[1:24:23] he's don't say to me and you this is
[1:24:25] this is this is our prophet talking to
[1:24:29] this group of people today right here in
[1:24:32] this room no one else
[1:24:34] all right so shake yourself if you want
[1:24:36] if you want to be in enough if you want
[1:24:38] to sleep in another dimension go ahead
[1:24:39] but you may miss something when we die
[1:24:42] our souls will go under the altar of God
[1:24:44] where I was privileged to see a few
[1:24:46] morning's ago as you know in the vision
[1:24:48] where the Bible speaks up our spirits
[1:24:50] will go to God who give it our body
[1:24:53] shall return to the dust of the earth
[1:24:54] but some day with us when the scriptures
[1:24:57] fulfilled our spirits will be released
[1:24:59] from God will pick up the soul and the
[1:25:02] soul to the body and the power that'll
[1:25:04] raise us up is right in us now we are
[1:25:10] now in heavenly places we are now in the
[1:25:14] power of the Resurrection see that's why
[1:25:18] we got a lap this thing back under here
[1:25:19] because right here's where the
[1:25:21] resurrection that's where that power
[1:25:22] comes made manifest right here's where
[1:25:26] it's made manifest not over here is made
[1:25:27] manifest right here
[1:25:28] it's seen it's got to be in you now to
[1:25:30] carry you somewhere if there wasn't a
[1:25:33] law to that sons and daughters of God
[1:25:35] would create them a world out there and
[1:25:37] go live a private life it be your own
[1:25:40] little world some of you do that anyway
[1:25:47] you have the power in you to do it if
[1:25:50] you've got a shadow a shadow of the
[1:25:59] power of God in you you've got the power
[1:26:01] to do it
[1:26:02] God is omnipotent see what I mean the
[1:26:05] power that's in you will make you could
[1:26:07] speak a world into existence and go live
[1:26:10] on it hallelujah
[1:26:11] there you are now that's not this group
[1:26:16] of people okay they're powerless they
[1:26:23] don't get all the benefits of these but
[1:26:26] they do get a benefit a great one and a
[1:26:29] great revelation but the great
[1:26:31] revelation to me is is it happens we
[1:26:33] have to go to another dimension to see
[1:26:35] this thing take place and we're going to
[1:26:40] find out about that white robe next
[1:26:41] Sunday and about why they were given to
[1:26:43] them but we're gonna also see that if it
[1:26:46] how many times in the fifth seal I'll
[1:26:48] count them if you read the fifth seal
[1:26:50] count how many times brother Branham
[1:26:52] talks about grace go there's no way this
[1:26:54] has to be the Great Seal of the of the
[1:26:57] Bible because how in the world can God
[1:27:01] give eternal life to a group of people
[1:27:04] that hated him literally hated him said
[1:27:09] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:27:12] but God put him in a place so he could
[1:27:15] break a seal to show you that the real
[1:27:20] you never did it because if you come to
[1:27:27] these people right here and if they've
[1:27:28] got one little speck that God can see he
[1:27:31] can't give them eternal life they have
[1:27:35] to be totally wiped clean and white
[1:27:37] robes had given to him because of what
[1:27:40] God did now you and I you said boy
[1:27:46] they're kind of Rascals no you not come
[1:27:48] under that same thing we were a group of
[1:27:51] people that didn't want God
[1:27:54] you didn't come out of the womb crime
[1:27:56] for God you went and did your thing
[1:28:00] right I went and did my thing I didn't
[1:28:04] want nothing to do with God but you know
[1:28:05] what he had a place called grace he had
[1:28:08] a place called grace that we could come
[1:28:10] to that one day that he'll call your
[1:28:13] name and you answer and then the
[1:28:15] predestinated that are here we get our
[1:28:20] white robe here they get their white
[1:28:22] robes in another dimension they're
[1:28:26] already dead they're already there their
[1:28:28] bodies are laying somewhere they've been
[1:28:29] burnt up they've been shot they've been
[1:28:31] gassed but someday God's gonna honor
[1:28:35] what he said he's gonna give them
[1:28:37] eternal life just for being a Jew and
[1:28:41] for him blinding their eyes but he
[1:28:44] blinded their eyes so that you and I
[1:28:47] could come in let's stand our feet he
[1:28:51] blinded their eyes so that you and I
[1:28:54] could come in you and I would have never
[1:28:57] had an opportunity of salvation if
[1:29:00] Israel would have accepted Christ the
[1:29:04] way he was when he came to earth you and
[1:29:06] I did not have a chance though look what
[1:29:09] we didn't have a promise
[1:29:10] we had no promise until the Holy Ghost
[1:29:15] fell that's the only promise we had all
[1:29:18] right hey man the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:29:20] promise would thinkable is the only
[1:29:22] promise we had and that came after Jesus
[1:29:24] left so we thank God
[1:29:30] maybe we'll see now that that what grace
[1:29:34] really is when we get finished with this
[1:29:35] sale that it's amazing grave sting God
[1:29:38] came to us but that he also brother Kern
[1:29:41] allowed us to see this thing happened
[1:29:45] see these seals not literally open out
[1:29:49] there but we see them open what in our
[1:29:52] room we see them open to us and they
[1:29:55] become something to me like brother
[1:29:57] brems said he says the greatest realm
[1:30:00] he's ever worked in why because all the
[1:30:04] things he had thought
[1:30:06] was this way and when those seals open
[1:30:09] they were that way and what happened God
[1:30:14] enough grace to God to do this he turned
[1:30:19] that prophet to where the back side and
[1:30:21] the front side finally matched and then
[1:30:24] what he give it to us and what do we do
[1:30:27] what do we do do we do this no we need
[1:30:30] to come back and learn that thing have
[1:30:33] it lined up so we can see what God has
[1:30:35] for us musicians come you know I'm sorry
[1:30:38] we got communion today let's bow our
[1:30:40] heads chamblee father thank you for this

[1:31:14] Lord is so close to where we're going to
[1:31:17] take that communion with you with our
[1:31:19] glorified bodies where we can eat Lord
[1:31:22] the ones that are in the sixth dimension
[1:31:24] are longing to come back because they
[1:31:27] can't take communion they can't eat
[1:31:28] while they're where they're at they're
[1:31:30] not complete the Lord just told us in
[1:31:34] Hebrews 11 they without us cannot be
[1:31:39] made perfect
[1:31:40] so the perfection comes when we stand on
[1:31:43] this earth and a glorified body that's
[1:31:45] the Alpha knew that was before the
[1:31:47] foundation in the world has took over it
[1:31:50] took over every cell and every fiber of
[1:31:52] our being and made us in a glorified
[1:31:56] condition father just give us grace
[1:31:59] forgive us of our sins Lord as we stand
