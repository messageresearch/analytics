[9:48] your words you come and speak to our
[9:50] hearts and let your light shine to each
[9:52] one in Jesus name Amen
[9:56] we've been reading this scripture for
[9:58] quite a while but we still will keep on
[10:02] reading and I guess for a while too so
[10:04] we're going to first Peter 1:22 and 23
[10:08] seeing you have purified your souls and
[10:11] obeying the truth through the spirit
[10:13] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[10:16] that you love one another with a pure
[10:18] heart fervently being born again now how
[10:22] not of corruptible seed that we're not
[10:26] caring about the seeds and the things
[10:28] because everything is corruptible but
[10:30] other in what is the incorruptible seed
[10:32] of God but by the end corrupt
[10:35] by the Word of God which liveth and
[10:38] about us forever so let's go over now to
[10:42] 2nd Peter 1 or we've been reading from
[10:47] we'll read about 7 vs. silent Peter
[10:51] servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[10:53] them that have obtained like precious
[10:55] faith with us through the righteousness
[10:57] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ who's
[11:00] Peter riding to not to the world he's
[11:03] writing to the church those that are in
[11:05] Christ ok grace and peace be multiplied
[11:08] unto you through the knowledge of God
[11:10] and Jesus our Lord according as his
[11:13] divine power hath given unto us all
[11:15] things that pertain unto life and
[11:18] godliness through the knowledge of him
[11:21] that have called us to glory and virtue
[11:24] so there's a position you're called to a
[11:27] position the position is glory and
[11:30] virtue all right
[11:31] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[11:33] great and precious promises that by
[11:37] these you might be partakers of the
[11:39] divine nature having escaped the
[11:41] corruption that is in the world through
[11:43] lust and beside this giving all
[11:45] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[11:48] to virtue knowledge and the knowledge
[11:50] temperance and to temperance patience
[11:52] and to patience godliness and to
[11:54] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[11:56] brotherly kindness charity you may be
[11:59] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[12:02] reading of the word now what have we
[12:04] been doing for all of these time is
[12:08] studying on the stature of a perfect man
[12:11] all right so Peter is here writing to
[12:15] you and I to tell us how to come where
[12:18] he was he had reached that position of
[12:23] faith he had reached that new birth and
[12:26] they had been tutored for three and a
[12:29] half years by the Lord Jesus and then
[12:32] when the Holy Ghost fell on them it
[12:34] placed them at the point where we know
[12:37] on the pyramid is called a Holy Spirit
[12:39] you know just above the brotherly
[12:41] kindness and coming in there too
[12:45] bring to that position but that was lost
[12:48] down through the ages by the cankerworm
[12:51] pommel worm locust caterpillar eating
[12:53] away
[12:54] they ate away these things and had to be
[12:57] restored
[12:58] all right now as I said about Peter he's
[13:00] speaking to those of the same faith so
[13:04] everybody has the new birth you're born
[13:06] again at faith faith is a revelation
[13:09] from God and what is the new word Christ
[13:11] the mystery of God revealed it's the
[13:13] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[13:16] you not to everybody personally to you
[13:19] bringing Christ into you so Peter had
[13:22] that and he's addressing it to people
[13:24] that had received it as a new birth on
[13:26] the day of Pentecost but as I've always
[13:28] tried to explain it to you you go to the
[13:31] day of Pentecost and you got a split
[13:33] condition you got a hundred and twenty
[13:36] that was Peter and James and all of them
[13:38] and they had been tutored three and a
[13:40] half years and then when the Holy Ghost
[13:42] fell it positioned them to what we call
[13:45] the faith of the fathers are the the the
[13:48] point you know they're the opening of
[13:50] the word all right but then there was
[13:53] 3,000 see in just a little short period
[13:57] of time that they received the Holy
[13:59] Spirit but it didn't put them it made
[14:02] them babies desire in the sense fear of
[14:06] milk of the word that they may grow
[14:07] thereby it didn't put them where the
[14:10] Apostles were all right so the Apostles
[14:13] start writing the word you know they're
[14:16] writing the word and Peter's writing to
[14:19] tell us how to come to where he was
[14:21] because brother branham what was he
[14:23] trying to do trying to tell us how to
[14:25] come to where he was what is the purpose
[14:28] of anybody's preaching her thoughts they
[14:30] I'm trying to bring us out to you I'm
[14:33] wanting you to understand where I'm
[14:34] talking about what I'm doing and I want
[14:37] you to come to this place to heard it
[14:39] I've come to that place and telling you
[14:41] about it now what our problems has been
[14:43] a lot of times is people talking about
[14:45] something they didn't possess they had a
[14:49] confession but they didn't have a
[14:51] possession and that's been the problem
[14:53] through the ages at times but you know
[14:56] now we should be at the end time
[14:59] because we've received the message we've
[15:01] got the entire Bible unveiled before us
[15:05] because of the prophets message bringing
[15:07] it to us and in allowing us to follow it
[15:11] and understand and that's why that to me
[15:14] it's so marvelous to think about the
[15:18] Prophet and the things he was doing and
[15:21] I've tried to make a little illustration
[15:23] for the past two or three services that
[15:26] you know in the Bible we read something
[15:29] and we use words because that's not the
[15:31] way we can express what we do it
[15:32] it's through words all right and we say
[15:34] words what I like but a word here if you
[15:38] said and we heard brother Branham you
[15:40] know he'd say oh we're going on we used
[15:43] to his little boys we used to go down
[15:44] here and go singing no he was saying it
[15:51] right because that's northern word let's
[15:54] see we're southern and seen and didn't
[15:56] you know it took me I had to go to the
[15:58] Webster one day I kept hearing that and
[16:00] I thought I'm gonna see what that is
[16:02] that's the same word I know see we call
[16:04] it signing but it's the same word it's
[16:09] just from north and south you know and
[16:11] you know but that way I'm trying to tell
[16:15] you that a prophet comes and he gives
[16:19] you the understanding of the word even
[16:24] though the words are not spelled that
[16:26] away right and that's what we've driven
[16:30] pretty hard in the message of like
[16:33] virtue the faith then go to virtue will
[16:37] enter natural terminologies we would go
[16:40] to virgin birth maybe that way our a
[16:43] person being a virgin
[16:45] we wouldn't connect it but a random when
[16:48] he brought it he said now it's not like
[16:50] that word here in other word in this
[16:52] statue of perfect man it's more or less
[16:55] to the point of a virtuous life and
[16:57] power and strength and thing all right
[17:01] then we come on over to very faith
[17:03] virtue or knowledge temperance see
[17:06] temperance to us means don't drink
[17:08] alcohol all right let's see he said
[17:11] that's not according to
[17:12] this is here this is not that he said
[17:15] this is the controlling of that temper
[17:18] in things all right of course we didn't
[17:21] like that because we didn't think we
[17:23] still had any temper you know we thought
[17:26] we we taught that it all went out when
[17:30] we got saved and then you cross from
[17:33] just a little bit and start getting the
[17:34] red face and start puffing up you know
[17:36] and when you do then you find out that
[17:39] maybe somewhere there's a little bit of
[17:41] need of patience you know into our lives
[17:44] but the point of what I'm getting at is
[17:47] when we get into this when we're gonna
[17:49] talk about godliness and why would
[17:52] brother around him say you know a man
[17:53] like that he said I looked for the word
[17:57] godliness and in many dictionaries well
[18:00] the way it sounds like that he couldn't
[18:02] find a definition of godliness what now
[18:04] that's not what he's saying because he's
[18:06] saying I couldn't find what I wanted he
[18:10] wanted to find a definition of godliness
[18:12] that would be according to him and these
[18:15] scriptures and what to expect to see
[18:18] because you pick up any dictionary check
[18:21] it any dictionary you look up godliness
[18:24] it'll give you the definition of
[18:26] godliness but it doesn't refer to what
[18:29] he's saying of godliness I've checked
[18:32] you know a little bit of it
[18:33] it simply means to be to be like God is
[18:36] to be possibly religious to be a good
[18:39] Christian to do different things like
[18:41] that but when he comes to godliness
[18:43] he said godliness is to be like God will
[18:47] you say well that's supposed to be the
[18:49] possum to do this that no no it's not
[18:51] anyway it's to be like God because
[18:55] that's the definition we're beginning to
[18:57] but I want you to see that see a prophet
[18:59] gives you the definition of a word it
[19:04] gives you an understanding of a word
[19:06] that
[19:07] Scofield's and Webster's and Strong's
[19:10] and all won't give to you so we depend
[19:13] upon what he's saying you know all right
[19:17] see then to talk about godliness today
[19:19] now we're going to talk about to be like
[19:21] God then you'll say is we'll get to and
[19:25] reading a little bit you'll say well we
[19:27] do that well we'll get to the point in a
[19:31] minute to see what it is because see I'm
[19:35] a firm believer tried to express to you
[19:38] 40-something years or more preaching on
[19:41] this that we have to have these virtues
[19:45] that is spoken of in Peter it's not just
[19:49] a message of a good thought or something
[19:51] he's trying as I said a moment ago
[19:53] Peter's trying to tell you to get where
[19:55] he was at which he was up you know up
[19:58] here where it says Holy Spirit when he
[20:01] received the Holy Spirit on the day of
[20:03] Pentecost it was right here
[20:04] we received the Holy Spirit of the new
[20:06] birth down here as a baby
[20:08] come on coinsurance not I don't mean
[20:11] this sarcastic but it's the truth
[20:12] well it gets me as the people of this
[20:14] message can't understand we taught that
[20:16] in the Baptist Church we talking about
[20:22] this church that when you're saved you
[20:24] was only saved as a baby in Christ we
[20:27] taught that in a Baptist Church what's
[20:29] wrong with our understanding was we said
[20:31] well we don't the brother Dale he's he's
[20:33] this out of the other no I'm just trying
[20:35] to get you to see something straight a
[20:38] lot of these things were taught but it
[20:41] was not able to put it together the way
[20:43] the Prophet wrote then he brought it and
[20:46] he said now these things here are
[20:47] required of you when I remember Richard
[20:52] when he first time he said it today he's
[20:54] read it and everything he said I didn't
[20:57] know that these things were required
[21:00] what see we find what we were Christian
[21:02] we were born again we're automatically
[21:04] on our way to heaven we got every time
[21:07] we packed up and ready to go and then
[21:10] Peter says but you still got a little
[21:14] problem with your temperance you got a
[21:17] little problem with your patience and
[21:21] the whole of the hat you know and we say
[21:25] no no we don't have no problem we were
[21:26] we were we we got everything that's good
[21:29] badness we got everything when we leave
[21:31] and I know I said it to them back then
[21:33] as well as I say it now I said why does
[21:35] the Bible say being born again
[21:38] you know why does it say that's what I
[21:41] asked a pastor that was there when I
[21:43] left I said why does the Bible say that
[21:46] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[21:49] be saved I said how come y'all told us
[21:52] all we had to do is believe they said
[21:56] well I don't know I said you know
[21:58] yourself that that's the way you teach
[22:00] it you teach it all we got to do is
[22:02] believe and the devil bleed and trembles
[22:07] about it and he said well I guess you're
[22:10] right I said well that's true
[22:11] you didn't tell us the whole truth the
[22:14] word is believeth continually going on
[22:17] being born again continually going on
[22:20] it's not just walk up the altar accept
[22:22] Jesus Christ hey glory hallelujah we're
[22:24] on the way to heaven well that's kind of
[22:29] our thoughts but that's not gonna work
[22:30] out that away all right now but you you
[22:33] get what I'm saying then that these
[22:36] things are required of us to be back to
[22:41] the faith of the father's the faith of
[22:43] the father's is a revelation of the
[22:45] father's see then that has to be in the
[22:48] Bride of Christ and we read it to you
[22:50] there Wednesday from the Chrysler
[22:53] mystery of God I mean from statute of
[22:55] perfectman paragraph like 354 words
[22:58] brother Branham is talking about the
[23:00] church and he said the church that has
[23:04] these virtues in other words he said
[23:08] that's the church that's going in going
[23:10] to rapture huh and he said on the end of
[23:14] visual that has these virtues is the
[23:16] person that's going in the rapture so
[23:18] what's the requirement of a rapture we
[23:21] spoke of a rapture for 50 years right
[23:23] since we've been in the message we
[23:24] talked to the rapture but what is the
[23:26] rapture rapture is a revelation is that
[23:30] the way the Prophet said if you don't
[23:32] raptures a revelation
[23:34] well I I'm expecting a revelation more
[23:37] than I am some kind of a move or some
[23:40] point I'm looking for the opening of the
[23:42] word all right so then he says without
[23:46] these virtues you're not gonna have a
[23:48] rapture
[23:50] then he goes on in the same message
[23:53] another paragraph or so and he says
[23:55] you're not going to have the
[23:56] resurrection without these virtues but
[24:01] brother Daly can this resurrection
[24:03] didn't come rapture is gonna come you're
[24:05] not listening to what he's saying if
[24:10] somebody don't get these virtues I
[24:12] didn't say it he's the one that said it
[24:14] and the Bible said it they without us
[24:16] cannot be made perfect and we're gonna
[24:19] get to that in a minute
[24:20] in the godliness to try to tie that
[24:24] together the that they without us the
[24:27] whole thing is waiting on somebody to
[24:30] come to the place to walk where the
[24:33] apostles were walking as a possession
[24:36] and not a confession right the
[24:39] difference in the confession and the
[24:40] possession you can walk on a possession
[24:44] confession you can't walk on it it will
[24:46] hold you you'll sink but you won't sink
[24:50] if we walk in my faith all right that's
[24:53] that right
[24:53] see they know what did he say he said
[24:56] that that church would have to come now
[25:01] I'm on three sixty four seven statue a
[25:04] perfect man the church has got to come
[25:07] he said to these virtues and he called
[25:14] it perfection right that's what he
[25:19] called it he said perfection the church
[25:23] he's got to come to perfection
[25:26] then he said then it'll bring the
[25:28] resurrection and he said and they are
[25:30] waiting on us what to come to perfection
[25:35] well we can't be perfect so they'll
[25:37] never be a change he'll never be a
[25:39] rapture we'll just keep on going but
[25:43] somebody's going to come to it because
[25:45] God said it all right he promised it
[25:48] it'll be there we may not be part of it
[25:51] but we got an opportunity to be part of
[25:53] it we see he says that the church has
[25:57] got to come to perfection in order to
[26:00] bring the resurrection
[26:02] to perfection that's literally his word
[26:05] to use the word perfection twice in that
[26:07] paragraph showing that we've got to come
[26:10] to a place where the disciples were
[26:14] because they're waiting on us
[26:17] well I wish you would get this one
[26:19] natural little point if things are
[26:21] waiting on us then we're gonna have to
[26:23] match what they had they're not waiting
[26:27] on it doesn't say that the church is
[26:30] just waiting you know the Paul and Peter
[26:32] and all them was waiting on somebody to
[26:34] get born-again it don't say that it's a
[26:37] position it's a place that they were at
[26:41] you're not gonna pull Paul out of the
[26:43] ground with a Baptist doctrine I don't
[26:45] care it may be a true doctrine it may
[26:48] have brought eternal life to the people
[26:49] back there but it will not do it today
[26:53] right see it won't do it now it's a
[26:57] position this endtime is going to have
[26:59] to reach to draw the dead from the grave
[27:03] see then what God wants to do after the
[27:06] resurrection we're going to be here
[27:07] thirty forty days we can have a great
[27:09] glorious time shouting and and
[27:11] everything you'd be preaching all across
[27:13] the land and running back and forth
[27:15] doing everything brother Branham spoke
[27:16] of but there's got to be a resurrection
[27:20] first because remember according to the
[27:22] Bible it says the dead in Christ shall
[27:25] rise first and we wish to know Ivan
[27:27] Tremaine it's alright
[27:29] those are the windows go not to raise so
[27:32] I'm looking for as I've always told you
[27:33] I'm not looking for a rapture I'm
[27:35] looking for a resurrection all right
[27:38] because that way we're resurrected out
[27:41] of our denominationalism awake thou that
[27:44] sleepless the scripture says this
[27:46] prophet said that was the bride that was
[27:48] the sleep in organized religion brother
[27:52] Dale I wouldn't sleep okay you are you
[27:58] won't do about it I just said what he
[28:00] said
[28:01] I admit where I come from I admit we was
[28:05] coming down through there sleeping in
[28:06] slumber and then thought was right don't
[28:09] you but come to find out the Prophet
[28:12] said no you're not that's where you told
[28:14] the Pentecost
[28:15] he said you say you got your here you've
[28:17] got lighter rain lighter rain you got
[28:20] all these movement he said you ain't
[28:21] even had to form a rain yet how do you
[28:26] think those people felt when he said it
[28:29] like that alright but now listen and
[28:34] we'll get to godliness in a second to
[28:37] pick up that it means to be like God
[28:40] all right now Hebrews 11:40 says they
[28:44] without us should not be made perfect
[28:50] alright now when Paul wrote that he was
[28:54] not in the grave but he was writing it
[29:00] as an us which would apply to everything
[29:03] in everybody you know what the next day
[29:07] maybe he was in the grave you know what
[29:09] he was doing waiting on us
[29:11] he wouldn't waiting on him we're not
[29:15] waiting on Paul that's where everybody
[29:17] puts we're waiting on this now no no
[29:18] we're not waiting on those things
[29:21] they're waiting on us to simply believe
[29:26] the prophets message and walk out on it
[29:29] the whole world is waiting on us what
[29:33] are we here for we're here to prove to
[29:37] Satan the Prophet said that we wouldn't
[29:39] fall like Eve fell we're here to prove
[29:43] those things all right bring it on devil
[29:47] I mean make us go what did the Prophet
[29:50] say he said the bride always done better
[29:53] on the persecution now I ain't won't no
[29:56] persecution I ain't won't no slim
[29:58] bellies because you know that I could
[30:00] they took a food away from me I'm not
[30:03] talking like that I'm not crazy
[30:05] little dumb but not crazy I'm talking
[30:09] about that somebody has got to become
[30:11] the word to draw the rest what's going
[30:16] to draw them out we're not going to walk
[30:20] down to the cemetery it's a Cologne no
[30:22] that's why I've got the pictures
[30:24] downstairs of the people that have
[30:26] passed on
[30:27] get to see your sister back there with
[30:30] we say welcome to UK we've got a
[30:33] teachers there of the people that have
[30:35] died I won't know what you look like you
[30:38] know why because I won't know what you
[30:40] look like when you're raised when they
[30:43] walk among us I don't problem I go to
[30:44] hey we got your picture you know because
[30:49] I believe the resurrection is going to
[30:52] come and one day they're gonna walk
[30:54] among us but it's not going to be on
[30:57] impt and cemeteries it's not going to be
[30:59] running down to the cemetery to pray and
[31:01] in the race no it's the faith you're
[31:05] walking in when that faith drops in the
[31:09] heart of the people you're gonna see the
[31:12] dead race that's as simple as I can make
[31:15] it when the faith drops in the heart all
[31:19] right then
[31:21] somebody's gonna have to not go out and
[31:26] call the dead but somebody's gonna have
[31:30] to call all of us dead heads out of our
[31:33] sleep and wake us up into Jesus Christ
[31:37] and then he'll take care of the rest of
[31:40] it where's the glory going to him no
[31:44] resurrection they no resurrection
[31:46] without Jesus Christ all right but I do
[31:49] love one thing the Prophet said you know
[31:52] I don't mean I don't love the rest of it
[31:54] but that's the point
[31:55] he said the resurrection was inside of
[31:58] you your resurrection is in you it's in
[32:02] your spirit and as I said the other day
[32:04] that's not in your memory reason
[32:06] conscience affection spirit it's in the
[32:09] Holy Spirit because like that word is if
[32:12] brother dick Addison was here he'd need
[32:14] amen this point because he you take the
[32:16] word spirit and the word soul and you
[32:20] run it through the Bible and you'll find
[32:23] out it's a totally interchangeable word
[32:28] it glows so legs together till when
[32:31] you've got to find out what they're
[32:33] talking about to see what it means in
[32:36] that's that part you say well that's
[32:38] just my spirit Jesus's spirit
[32:41] him in the garden now if his spirit left
[32:45] him in the garden as a prophet said it
[32:47] did and we play that as his spirit
[32:50] before then he died because you can't
[32:54] live without your spirit what left him
[32:57] in the garden the power the anointing
[33:00] the things that was there with him that
[33:03] would not let him die
[33:04] he had that had to be removed from the
[33:07] human element so he could finally die
[33:09] for our sins
[33:11] all right now so then this is to the
[33:15] point of what we see the wordings but do
[33:20] we understand the terminologies or
[33:22] thoughts that goes with the things like
[33:25] I said there the Prophet would say now
[33:27] this year word virtue said it doesn't
[33:30] mean just being a virgin well he
[33:33] wouldn't against being a virgin no he
[33:37] believed in that but that was not the
[33:38] definition to be used in understanding
[33:41] Peters wording when he used the word
[33:44] virtue and probably he didn't use the
[33:47] word virtue we just used the Greek or
[33:49] Hebrew or whatever that word was see if
[33:52] we could go back and read those things
[33:53] we may be catching better onto what
[33:56] those word actually say you know but we
[33:59] take Webster's definition cuz we're you
[34:01] know yet we're English and you take that
[34:05] word virtue over to Germany there's no
[34:10] telling what you might find the word for
[34:13] you get me
[34:14] let's see Peter he brought it and then
[34:17] when they put the King James into it
[34:19] they used the word virtue what's the
[34:23] thing we had the definition it means
[34:25] virgin
[34:27] that was not Peter saying Peter was
[34:30] looking at a virtuous life with power in
[34:34] Christ see that way you can get the
[34:38] meaning of the word and it unfolds the
[34:42] rest of the story to where you can
[34:45] follow it and see that way then it
[34:48] doesn't matter about the educational
[34:49] side of you the most illiterate person
[34:53] can understand God
[34:55] because God can speak to them they don't
[34:58] have to speak inaudible voices talking
[35:01] inner word or whatever you know they can
[35:03] do all of those things because that's
[35:05] the way it is that he can talk to
[35:08] anybody and do but now that are you
[35:10] following me then we'll get to the word
[35:12] godliness because we kind of take one
[35:14] thing in another thing another me this
[35:18] is the one that is the I don't know what
[35:24] you could use that a big fancy thing
[35:26] they say this is the catchphrase or
[35:28] whatever you're saying you know in other
[35:30] words this is something to anchor and it
[35:32] settles it
[35:33] I've waited a long time to get to this
[35:35] part right here to where I can say what
[35:38] I want to say about this and I believe
[35:41] it will help us to understand all of the
[35:42] background of the virtues and the things
[35:46] that's required and what it is because
[35:50] we look at it as being something that
[35:52] cannot be attained and not come on if
[35:58] you're a human when you first read about
[36:01] the word virtue that the way the Prophet
[36:04] used it our definitions was different
[36:08] from what his thinking was especially
[36:14] now as we getting out to godliness and
[36:18] he looked up in the dictionaries now he
[36:22] got four dictionaries he said four or
[36:25] five he said and he looked up the word
[36:28] godliness well he didn't get the
[36:32] understanding from all of those
[36:36] dictionaries that he knew Peter was
[36:40] saying so you can say well godliness
[36:44] means pie or you know the different
[36:47] things I'm getting it's in here
[36:48] somewhere but it means all of those
[36:51] things the word see godliness but then
[36:55] he said it means to be like God all
[36:59] right now he entered it in so marvelous
[37:03] a way of understanding until it's
[37:05] amazing to the human mind to think that
[37:08] you have to realize it had to be God
[37:10] irregardless of you using godliness do
[37:14] you realize that it has to be God to
[37:16] reveal to us even what that means what
[37:20] does it mean to be be like God what does
[37:26] that mean well it's supposed to be like
[37:28] God we're just supposed to be like no no
[37:31] the Toki's of the day we don't want to
[37:34] be like God
[37:34] that's the Antichrist he likes to be
[37:38] like God no huh now we don't want to be
[37:42] like God the children of God is not like
[37:45] God the children of God is God made
[37:48] manifest in another form called a church
[37:50] right or whatever the words are we were
[37:53] discussing something there last night
[37:54] and it came to me on the penet night
[37:56] after because we were discussing like
[37:58] where it says you know that this group
[38:02] of people receives eternal life that's a
[38:04] bride well this group has to go
[38:05] somewhere else to get eternal life you
[38:08] know
[38:08] well that I brought I thought laying
[38:11] there thinking about it and then you
[38:14] know kind of halfway asleep and I
[38:15] thought about it you know to me now we
[38:20] know adoption and we know how it works
[38:21] and all that and it goes into the
[38:23] spiritual but still in the physical
[38:26] you're thinking about it and what I've
[38:29] thought about saying see that we wonder
[38:33] well how come it cause this group abroad
[38:35] and this group over here a foolish
[38:38] virgin remember according to your
[38:42] prophet it's the same material of the
[38:45] dress right the bride ain't no piece of
[38:53] material different from the foolish
[38:55] virgin it's the same piece of material
[38:56] it's the same religious realm but made
[39:00] possible by the blood of Jesus Christ
[39:02] alright now see then that means this
[39:05] group in this group the materials are
[39:07] same it's just and we were talking about
[39:09] how that it means that one can have a
[39:11] confession and the other one has a
[39:13] possession well I thought about it this
[39:16] way maybe a hippie
[39:19] see adoption all right
[39:26] you adopt somebody else's child now we
[39:29] you know we go into adoption we dropped
[39:31] his own children etcetera that's not
[39:33] what I'm trying to express and I'm
[39:34] trying to get you to look at something
[39:35] see we we our children are our children
[39:38] by blood right there are our blood
[39:43] children but an adopted child is not
[39:46] your blood children but they're just as
[39:50] much your children after they're adopted
[39:53] as it is for your blood children there's
[39:56] the difference between the bride are the
[39:59] you know the church and the foolish
[40:02] virgin it's the same material it's just
[40:07] what's chosen this is his people his
[40:10] offspring
[40:12] these are adopted in to him being an
[40:15] offering and we'll get to it on adoption
[40:17] see we Gentiles had to be adopted in we
[40:21] had no right of adoption the right of
[40:24] adoption was to the Israelites then the
[40:27] Bible says that we had no we'll get to
[40:29] that later as was covering the message
[40:31] but you think about it see that way you
[40:34] can see this is blood relation this is
[40:37] everything this is looking just exactly
[40:39] like it look it is not to blood relation
[40:43] God's children our God made manifest now
[40:49] why wouldn't we believe it that well
[40:50] yeah but brother Dale I thought the
[40:52] Bible says I thought Paul said it's not
[40:54] our that liveth but Christ that liveth
[40:56] in me and the life that I now live by
[40:58] the faith he wouldn't count nothing he
[41:02] had he was going on to what God was
[41:05] calling him all right
[41:06] see God's children is God made manifest
[41:09] it's in another form right so then take
[41:13] that as to the thought that when you're
[41:16] saying godliness is not to try to be
[41:19] like God because the Antichrist wants to
[41:24] be like God everything is to be like God
[41:27] the religious world is because they come
[41:29] on we come from all over we we
[41:32] we taught the bloodline of the new birth
[41:37] but in actuality we couldn't separate
[41:40] all of this other so we just lumped it
[41:43] all into one and we just had everybody
[41:46] that could ever get eternal life they
[41:49] were the children of God no that's not
[41:51] according to the scripture only the
[41:54] born-again believer that gets born again
[41:55] here is the child of God foolish virgin
[41:58] has to go somewhere and get eternal life
[42:00] and by doing that see they're not the
[42:02] children of God in the bloodline they're
[42:05] the children of God as he's imparted
[42:07] unto them the way all right follow that
[42:10] thought and then you'll think about
[42:12] godliness that it means to be like God
[42:18] but not to be like God like somebody
[42:21] wants to be like God it's to be God
[42:24] now it'll clear up then why he's
[42:26] bringing all of these things but now I
[42:28] want to quote these couple here see this
[42:35] church marker 367 a statue of a perfect
[42:39] man they can pull it up they went to
[42:41] number two this church has got to come
[42:44] to perfection in order to bring the
[42:49] resurrection well uh we can't come to
[42:55] perfection brother Dale not there is our
[42:58] argument an old Baptist argument we
[43:00] argued over Matthew 5:48 be therefore
[43:04] perfect and we had ever form of a way to
[43:07] try to explain that instead of just
[43:10] saying what it said that God says we're
[43:15] perfect as far as God is concerned with
[43:18] perfect as far as everybody else is
[43:20] concerned we'll never be perfect
[43:22] you will never be perfect I'll never be
[43:24] perfect in the people's eyes and mind
[43:26] but in God solves all things so then the
[43:34] church and it says and they're under
[43:37] sold under the altar waiting for the
[43:40] church to come to prove to its
[43:43] perfection that when Christ
[43:46] come waiting somebody's waiting on you
[43:52] or not me no I'm not the window flames
[43:58] or flicks blanket for everybody right
[44:00] now if it's in the grave is waiting on
[44:02] the end town bride no we're just waiting
[44:09] the time runs out and then okay it's all
[44:11] right
[44:12] without any according to the scripture
[44:14] if the Bible's right I say that for your
[44:18] concern not mine
[44:19] then if the prophets right of expressing
[44:22] how to come to perfection what is it
[44:25] going to require he's going to have to
[44:28] give us the definition of perfection
[44:30] that will fit to what we can follow and
[44:33] then he's going to how to give us a way
[44:35] are Short's the way to come to that
[44:37] perfection well we just get born again I
[44:41] don't understand brother Dale he just
[44:42] always want us to what do you want us to
[44:44] do we come to church we pay our tithes
[44:46] we we do this we love the Lord another
[44:48] all I want you to do is just die what a
[44:55] man that's read over he was here when
[44:59] Jim Jones happened you know and he had
[45:02] them people they died you know this guy
[45:05] as Fred said Freddie Sam ever tried to
[45:07] get you died he's that ever service that
[45:11] he tried to kill me as long as he's
[45:12] known me and ever service preaching to
[45:14] me he want me to die out to myself and
[45:17] we come into Christ all right see we
[45:20] can't come no other way that into Christ
[45:22] to think about perfection because
[45:24] perfection in the human race cannot be
[45:26] accomplished you think you get something
[45:29] out of the way don't worry about it
[45:31] they're gonna be something flop you down
[45:32] and just two minutes from time you think
[45:34] you've got that straightened out there's
[45:36] going to be another one
[45:37] there's no perfection in the human race
[45:39] the perfection is Jesus in Jesus Christ
[45:42] art if we have then a perpetuation if we
[45:47] have an offer and if we have a sacrifice
[45:49] is not it's though that in the Old
[45:52] Testament when they offered that
[45:54] sacrifice that at least maybe for that
[45:57] year you know it made
[46:00] Buuren had to offer it again or another
[46:02] year but do you realize when that
[46:03] sacrifice was offered God's coming into
[46:07] destroyed about the time the blood comes
[46:10] up he backs off he can't come over it
[46:13] because he's the one that said it he's
[46:15] the one that made the way and you're
[46:17] just doing what he says so what makes us
[46:19] perfect oh we're good I remember one of
[46:23] the Baptist Church talking about David I
[46:25] mean that's the dirtiest guy you've ever
[46:27] seen Judas Iscariot ain't no hype of a
[46:29] mean guy when you compare it to David
[46:32] the Bible says David was a man after
[46:36] God's own heart well it's got an
[46:39] adulteress no no see no no no that's not
[46:42] what it is
[46:44] David had a heart to cry out for
[46:48] forgiveness he had an honest and a
[46:52] contrite heart he had a willing heart to
[46:56] repent
[46:57] Scofield even declares it better rent
[47:00] him to closure on the way home from the
[47:02] bed with Bathsheba he cries out Lord
[47:04] return unto me the joy of thy salvation
[47:07] see but he couldn't do it it was under
[47:09] the blood of bulls and goats it couldn't
[47:10] take away those things enough to clear
[47:12] him but it would take and make him be
[47:14] that and the Bible says that you're a
[47:16] sacrifice and offerings he said they've
[47:19] become a stink in my nostrils
[47:21] that's God's definition to word in our
[47:24] offerings that he said for us to offer
[47:26] to make ourselves free for that year he
[47:30] says become a stink in my nostril but he
[47:32] said a man that's got an honest in the
[47:33] Contra heart till repentant heart in God
[47:38] means more than all the sacrifices
[47:43] because see a repentant heart leads you
[47:46] back to here alone how he asked maybe he
[47:49] has to he has to make away if he
[47:53] required us to do something he has to
[47:56] make away and he did through his own
[48:00] atonement through the blood all right
[48:03] see then it comes to that place run
[48:06] around gets over on walk ride excuse me
[48:08] why I'm against organized religion and
[48:10] he says don't just stand still
[48:13] you haven't got patience virtue all of
[48:17] these things and temperance and things
[48:20] and godliness and brotherly kindness all
[48:23] these things that's required of you the
[48:29] names of things that's required all of
[48:31] the virtues he said don't just stand
[48:34] still in other words we ought to be
[48:36] seeking he see Luther Wesley him in the
[48:43] coming down they didn't understand this
[48:45] so they were only trying to go to church
[48:48] and be good and give their lives and
[48:50] suffer for those things but we've got to
[48:54] be concerned with trying to come to
[48:56] perfection okay now let's go to number
[49:00] five when we read statue of a perfect
[49:03] man let's go to godliness and to see
[49:05] what the prophet has to say about
[49:06] godliness but then ye says it that away
[49:12] that's the point you can say well he
[49:14] said this out of the other sometimes
[49:15] you're writing sometimes you're wrong
[49:16] get the court already comes to these
[49:19] it's fearfully had godliness godliness
[49:21] be added what does godliness mean I
[49:23] looked in four or five dictionaries and
[49:26] couldn't even find what it meant
[49:28] nowadays the dictionary laying right in
[49:30] there are checked a while ago whose will
[49:32] brother Herman garland used to say he'd
[49:33] say the Bible says so and so I just read
[49:35] it while ago I know it's dark so I know
[49:37] in Webster there's a dictionary laying
[49:39] right in there
[49:40] that gives you the definition of
[49:42] godliness but it means Pais it means of
[49:46] that you know kind of like into a realm
[49:50] of holiness and thing but listen to what
[49:53] your prophet says about godliness what
[49:55] was he looking for a definition that fit
[49:59] what he was preaching not a definition
[50:03] to give him understanding of wordings or
[50:05] whatever he was looking to see what
[50:07] somebody brought it and he finally found
[50:10] it he said I looked in four or five
[50:12] dictionaries and couldn't even find what
[50:14] it meant finally I was down at brother
[50:16] Jeffrey's darting we found it in a
[50:17] dictionary godliness means to be like
[50:21] God
[50:23] oh my my you got faith virtue knowledge
[50:26] temperance patience and then see faith
[50:30] first or knowledge temperance patient
[50:31] then which means at that time or shortly
[50:34] thereafter it comes to a point of
[50:37] recognition of a starting because that's
[50:40] one of the word then is you see all
[50:42] right then after all of this then be
[50:47] like God then we're reading you realize
[50:55] God doesn't require you to be perfect
[50:57] until you reach godliness we're gonna
[51:03] read it let's see if you believe it
[51:10] that's why that you've got temperance
[51:14] and things like that that shows if you
[51:16] do have problems but like we were
[51:21] discussing yesterday the brother brought
[51:24] it out about the brother and we won't
[51:26] use his name on therefore the point but
[51:28] he talked her brother on him and he said
[51:30] there's no conscious of seeing or
[51:32] something no no condemnation he had
[51:36] reached a place that he could say
[51:39] there's no condemnation he had wetzel he
[51:43] had reached had achieved all right think
[51:46] about this then God then this means to
[51:49] be like God oh my you got faith virtue
[51:52] or knowledge temperance place then be
[51:54] like God he said we this listen you say
[51:59] I can't do that brother branham and I
[52:05] agree with you he was agreeing with cuz
[52:07] we can't do it we can't be perfect
[52:10] because will condemn our own selves
[52:13] there's nothing else but if he says I'm
[52:15] perfect why can't I say what he says
[52:19] come on I can't do that brother branham
[52:22] oh yes you can let me just read you now
[52:27] where did he go
[52:30] now listen look at what I'm talking
[52:33] about it's reading I told you that I've
[52:34] waited for months to preach this message
[52:37] all right he's talking about godliness
[52:44] right and the definition of godliness
[52:48] what's the first scripture he goes to
[52:50] when you would I would say back to him
[52:52] but brought around him I can't do it he
[52:54] said oh yes you can I'm gonna show you
[52:56] in the scripture where description he
[52:58] went to he didn't go to all of the paths
[53:04] and the deities and the things that you
[53:06] could read about God and how great he
[53:08] was and how he could be he didn't go to
[53:09] that look where he went to the very
[53:15] scripture we always argued and said we
[53:18] couldn't figure it out how can we be
[53:20] perfect
[53:21] oh that means this and it means that
[53:23] yeah this means is this means that
[53:25] that's mean and see I remember in the
[53:27] Baptist Church reading it and putting
[53:30] the dictionary and reading the
[53:32] dictionary and come to find out that
[53:35] perfect means complete hmm perfect we'll
[53:42] give it means full age perfection
[53:47] alright we see we're looking for perfect
[53:50] to be how great we are and how we didn't
[53:53] see in all week long I haven't done a
[53:54] thing all week long I haven't I like
[53:57] what would Jack Cole said that time when
[53:59] that lady come to him and said sir said
[54:01] I want you to pray for me I said I just
[54:05] can't control my tongue no Jack Cole was
[54:09] pretty stiff like me you know when
[54:10] there's talking a lot of time and he
[54:12] said back to her he said lady he said
[54:15] this pulpit only 14 or 15 feet long said
[54:18] ain't enough room for your tongue he was
[54:22] blood she wanted to do something bad we
[54:26] want to find out what it means to be
[54:27] perfect well we didn't do this we've
[54:30] done all of our penances we've done all
[54:33] of our praying we read all the books
[54:35] this week we've done everything
[54:36] correctly that we're supposed to do as
[54:38] Christians we've been wonderful and
[54:40] sweet and ever I think other thing to do
[54:42] with perfection
[54:44] that's if anything that's an outworking
[54:46] of perfection but it has nothing to do
[54:48] with perfection that don't make you
[54:50] perfect because you don't
[54:51] do wrong if it did what do you need a
[54:53] perpetuation why do you need something
[54:58] to take your place are you going to deny
[55:04] the scripture that we have an advocate
[55:05] with the father Jesus Christ the
[55:07] righteous why do we have an advocate
[55:11] because we're going to do wrong but us
[55:14] Christians don't do wrong that's where
[55:16] you lied that's as much as saying it you
[55:20] could say well line is a bad thing well
[55:22] you just lied Brazil I don't never do
[55:24] wrong I had a wrong thought all week
[55:26] long you hadn't you've been asleep all
[55:28] week and then there's dreams in that
[55:32] Wright brothers asking these if you
[55:36] dream I said crazy and then I have him
[55:40] weird ins I don't get them good ones
[55:43] that y'all talk about I get them weird
[55:45] ones it's just all messed up and when I
[55:48] get through I wonder is that me you
[55:51] don't ever do that and you have your
[55:52] dreams and then you say the Lord is that
[55:57] ripping me cuz the dream show how bad I
[56:00] was you know I would tell you when I've
[56:03] had for 40 years a dream and it keeps
[56:07] coming back and every once in a while I
[56:08] get away from another waiter well I
[56:11] could tell you that and you just die
[56:13] life and what it does it and then here
[56:17] comes runaround said if you have the
[56:19] same dream two or three times it means
[56:20] something well why does all that 40
[56:23] years being Lord am I that dirty I sure
[56:30] I'm glad there's a pot of beans that you
[56:31] can eat and mess up and can have a bad
[56:34] dream
[56:35] come on listen get you life and then now
[56:39] we'll go okay he says but I can't do
[56:46] that I can't be perfect I can't be
[56:50] excuse me I can't be like God then he
[56:52] goes to perfection and he says oh yes
[56:56] you can let me just read you a few
[56:58] scriptures here just a minute Matthew
[57:00] 5:48 will take this one and see what it
[57:02] sounds like
[57:04] Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed
[57:08] to be like God rah we're gonna take
[57:14] Matthew 5:48 to see if he's supposed to
[57:16] be like God we'll see why that he
[57:20] couldn't use the word you know godliness
[57:24] from other definitions they would not
[57:27] match this part because he would
[57:29] expecting the word godliness would go to
[57:32] piety deities in and all kind of things
[57:36] in that word of meaning and it would
[57:39] never match out how to that we can
[57:41] conquer this being that we are and come
[57:44] out of it as to be in what God wants us
[57:46] to be there's no way we can be perfect
[57:51] but I don't think we need to just keep
[57:54] volunteer and you know what I mean by
[57:56] that I don't think we need to justify
[57:59] all I can't help it Lord I know I said a
[58:01] dirty word while ago but I can't help it
[58:03] yeah you can you can zip your mouth up
[58:09] that's what I like about that one the
[58:11] other day was written where brother Owen
[58:12] said and over to faith virtue knowledge
[58:15] temperance and he said how to control
[58:17] that tongue
[58:19] he said that tattling tongue that was
[58:23] having to do with you I got a good one
[58:25] now that because it's my tongue all
[58:28] right listen he said let's go to Matthew
[58:31] 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be
[58:33] like God he's going to give you a
[58:36] definition of godliness right I mean
[58:42] right now you're going to give the
[58:43] definition of godliness so let's see if
[58:46] we can be like God what does God require
[58:49] for you and I to be to be like God what
[58:54] is his requirement so here you go
[58:58] you know the Bible says your gods jesus
[59:03] said so why all the virtue all the
[59:08] things that's in God is in you Matthew
[59:13] 5:48
[59:15] how are we gonna be perfect by these
[59:19] things coming within us that we didn't
[59:23] get when we were born again right or
[59:28] else why would you need them okay now
[59:30] watch what he goes to Jesus speaking in
[59:33] the Beatitudes be therefore perfect
[59:35] what's that
[59:35] perfect even as your father now he's
[59:38] going to this Christian in evidence
[59:39] perfect now look I read that you've got
[59:47] way up here now before you're asked to
[59:53] do that listen you got up to godliness
[59:59] because that's what he's talking about
[1:00:01] before God asked you to be perfect you
[1:00:12] come all the way to godliness then he
[1:00:14] starts talking about perfection that's
[1:00:20] to be like God that's not your past and
[1:00:22] your deities and the thing see that
[1:00:24] you're trying to make yourself to be
[1:00:25] some kind of goody-goody no come on you
[1:00:32] got it well be there for perfect what's
[1:00:35] that perfect even as your father in
[1:00:36] heaven is perfect
[1:00:37] you got way up here now before you're
[1:00:40] asked to do that all these things has to
[1:00:45] be added first then when you get up here
[1:00:49] he's ask you now to be perfect godliness
[1:00:54] sons and daughters of God you see why I
[1:01:02] waited so long to try to get to this
[1:01:03] message because it shows what that we've
[1:01:09] got problems we get born again we have
[1:01:13] troubles and heartaches and problems
[1:01:14] then we got virtue to come in and that
[1:01:17] means that we we're it turned out to be
[1:01:20] a virgin life you know virtuous life
[1:01:22] then we come to knowledge not head
[1:01:24] knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge of God's
[1:01:27] Word
[1:01:28] then we come to temperance and then we
[1:01:30] come to patience and after we come all
[1:01:33] of that way then evidently we mixed it
[1:01:38] all the way down through there because
[1:01:39] we tried to figure out what Matthew 5:48
[1:01:41] men now according to your prophet he
[1:01:45] puts Matthew 5:48 at godliness on the
[1:01:49] pyramid reading it but he puts it down
[1:01:58] with a perfect understanding that where
[1:02:01] we have the understanding instead of
[1:02:03] trying to figure out you come all the
[1:02:09] way then God expects you to be perfect
[1:02:14] well what about it you got way up here
[1:02:27] now before you're asked to do that
[1:02:35] before you're asked to be like God
[1:02:38] he's explaining Matthew 5:48 be
[1:02:41] therefore perfect he's explaining it now
[1:02:49] how do we come to perfection come on you
[1:02:57] want to quit and go home we listen to
[1:02:58] wait this evening or you want to
[1:03:02] continue a minute what's the next
[1:03:04] scripture brother Branham went to he
[1:03:12] went to Matthew 5:48 be therefore
[1:03:14] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:03:16] perfect and brother instead it's
[1:03:18] required of you and I to come today but
[1:03:21] he says now God didn't require this
[1:03:23] until it comes up here to godliness
[1:03:25] he didn't require those things to be the
[1:03:27] cause he understood
[1:03:32] he winked at her ignorances of not
[1:03:34] knowing and understanding and he would
[1:03:38] allow us in the body of Christ knowing
[1:03:40] that when when we come into the body of
[1:03:42] Christ we would still be babies babies
[1:03:44] blabber and run and do things wrong and
[1:03:47] he knew we would need virtue to cover up
[1:03:50] into those things but he knew the virtue
[1:03:53] that we would have to get a Bible
[1:03:56] definition of virtue and not a
[1:03:58] definition of it being just because
[1:04:00] you're a virgin but because that you've
[1:04:03] come to a virtuous life in Christ he
[1:04:08] doesn't say you're perfect guy did you
[1:04:14] come to knowledge and you come to
[1:04:15] tempered you come to patience and he
[1:04:17] knows that we're still gonna have a
[1:04:19] problem
[1:04:20] you said well I don't want no problem my
[1:04:21] temper is gone well I'm just don't let
[1:04:25] me rub the skin too much I might find
[1:04:29] out in a flare up just a little bit mine
[1:04:32] does you gonna say yours don't know I
[1:04:36] don't have no problems you lied who fits
[1:04:40] this 24 feet it still ain't long enough
[1:04:43] what's the difference in line cheating
[1:04:45] and stealing all the rest okay hey come
[1:04:48] on I'm trying to get a point across
[1:04:50] what's the next scripture if God is
[1:04:55] going to require us to be perfect
[1:04:59] and the Prophet says you say we can't
[1:05:02] intercept oh yes you can
[1:05:04] see we were approaching it wrong to try
[1:05:06] to find a some form of godliness
[1:05:10] something that we could say we had done
[1:05:13] or didn't do oh I believe the word well
[1:05:15] that's what I'm reading from right so
[1:05:22] what's the next scripture that he uses
[1:05:26] bring that back up brother call we want
[1:05:28] to come down so bring that up I want to
[1:05:31] just make sure to get this point and
[1:05:32] we'll quit on the rest of these other
[1:05:34] because listen right you don't back down
[1:05:37] where we get to Matthew 5:48 to get it
[1:05:40] in line to understand he's looked up in
[1:05:43] the dictionary trying to find godliness
[1:05:45] he can't find it he finally finds one
[1:05:47] definition says to be like God amen now
[1:05:50] we've got the Bible definition of the
[1:05:53] godliness that's in the statute of a
[1:05:55] perfect man we're not dealing with
[1:05:56] trying to be some deity or some pious or
[1:05:59] some super religious something we've
[1:06:03] come to something that can be attained
[1:06:07] what perfection but we can't be perfect
[1:06:12] that's what I mean
[1:06:14] there's no way we can be perfect that's
[1:06:17] why the word perfect we kept looking it
[1:06:19] up trying to find something worded it
[1:06:21] mean the word perfect means to complete
[1:06:23] complete let's see if I've got that now
[1:06:25] didn't read it off and yeah Matthew 5:48
[1:06:34] this is the definition of the word dark
[1:06:36] we're talking of be therefore perfect it
[1:06:40] means to well they've got it okay what's
[1:06:45] the definition from the word perfect it
[1:06:49] means a full age three days it don't
[1:06:53] have anything to do with how goody-goody
[1:06:55] we are there's no definition of how good
[1:06:59] we are
[1:07:00] oh we've become good so we're perfect we
[1:07:03] don't do that no more we're perfect that
[1:07:05] ain't wanted it listen a full age
[1:07:09] something that's brought to its end
[1:07:14] cross it into the law of the right
[1:07:18] wanting nothing necessary to
[1:07:22] completeness
[1:07:25] wanting nothing that would be necessary
[1:07:29] to completeness all right perfect that
[1:07:34] which is perfect consummate human
[1:07:37] integrity and virtue of man full grown
[1:07:41] adult of full age or mature there's
[1:07:45] anything in there about how we need to
[1:07:47] quit this need to quit that and he'd do
[1:07:48] that then we could be perfect there's no
[1:07:54] wording of those things that's why he
[1:07:57] didn't want the definition of pious and
[1:08:00] good innocent and great things of being
[1:08:02] gone he wanted to what he got he wanted
[1:08:05] a definition of to be like God how can
[1:08:08] any human being ever be like God he can
[1:08:17] do it when he becomes a full-grown he's
[1:08:21] gonna be a baby and blabber until he
[1:08:22] comes to full grown he's gonna grow up
[1:08:25] into him the head of all things I'm i
[1:08:27] quoting scripture so what's the
[1:08:33] definition of perfect to come to
[1:08:35] completeness all right I thought we
[1:08:38] believed we were in the life stage I
[1:08:39] thought we believed that there were
[1:08:41] seven seals to the Bible and the seven
[1:08:44] would be the number of what what is the
[1:08:47] number seven completion they know eight
[1:08:50] completion right all right eight is
[1:08:54] eternity going on place where we're at
[1:08:55] so where are we at we're in the life
[1:08:59] stage showing that that well the ages
[1:09:02] all of the things is comparison and
[1:09:04] bringing out to understanding to come to
[1:09:08] completeness God keeps pouring in his
[1:09:12] life until he becomes complete in you
[1:09:16] and me what do you stop well we'll break
[1:09:20] down when we get to this completeness
[1:09:21] are we gonna stop sinning no that's
[1:09:25] where you missed the whole thing
[1:09:26] you're trying to get a sinless
[1:09:28] perfection I want a forgiveness
[1:09:32] I don't justify well I can't help it you
[1:09:36] know I can't help but drink a little bit
[1:09:38] now you know or Lila now now y'all for
[1:09:40] that that order ended with a new birth
[1:09:42] that order begin ended when you started
[1:09:45] serving Christ right but when you start
[1:09:49] saying well well alright now we've got
[1:09:52] to come to a place of completeness that
[1:09:56] there's nothing else that can be done
[1:09:58] alright see when you come to godliness
[1:10:02] now look what's gonna come next
[1:10:06] brotherly kindness we got a long ways to
[1:10:08] go get that okay
[1:10:11] you see I've waited for months to preach
[1:10:14] this but now watch brother branham
[1:10:20] you've described to us the fact that
[1:10:24] there is a possibility of a church
[1:10:28] realizing they're perfect to match up
[1:10:33] Matthew 5:48 now we've got the
[1:10:36] definition because you gave the
[1:10:38] definitions to it of understanding that
[1:10:40] that does not mean a great religious
[1:10:42] Society a great thing of no sin why
[1:10:46] because the Prophet said as long as
[1:10:48] you're in this flesh now he didn't say
[1:10:50] you had to he didn't say it was okay
[1:10:52] he said long as you in this flesh you
[1:10:54] gonna be a sticker don't worry about it
[1:10:58] don't worry about it it's gonna be there
[1:11:01] if we worried as much about it try to
[1:11:04] keep that away as we do okay all right
[1:11:07] let's see something brought to an end
[1:11:13] that's worth a great message I'm hoping
[1:11:17] way to hurry up
[1:11:19] because see the 7th seals the end of all
[1:11:22] things
[1:11:23] that's what's your profits I didn't like
[1:11:27] that statement he said the 7th seal is
[1:11:30] the end of all time he says the end of
[1:11:32] the millennium is in to this the end of
[1:11:33] time either
[1:11:33] he said time even runs out on the
[1:11:35] seventh seal
[1:11:39] we're coming back to a simple little
[1:11:41] thoughts of our mind and doing that live
[1:11:43] in every day and find it out we're right
[1:11:45] in the midst of the seals seeing seeing
[1:11:52] it in the simplicity what it's supposed
[1:11:53] to really okay
[1:11:54] now brother branham what are we gonna do
[1:11:57] now so when I remember the paragraph
[1:12:01] number 302 where's that we jumped a
[1:12:07] thrill for real to going up or down
[1:12:10] there which way y'all go going to 304
[1:12:12] now this is a continuation of where we
[1:12:15] were okay when he was describing the
[1:12:20] Matthew 5:48 and the perfection and how
[1:12:23] that is the way it's supposed to be all
[1:12:26] right now watch what he said so now he's
[1:12:28] going to tell you how to become perfect
[1:12:32] let's see if you'll accept this one okay
[1:12:36] let's turn to Ephesians 4 okay and find
[1:12:43] out over here what in the book of
[1:12:45] Ephesians it says about this thing let's
[1:12:47] find out what it says about this thing
[1:12:49] of to be like God and perfection and
[1:12:52] completeness let's see what it says
[1:12:54] about it about how that we should how we
[1:12:58] should do Ephesians 4 chapter see now
[1:13:02] get what I'm saying before we read all
[1:13:04] of this it looks like that that you
[1:13:08] asked brother branham's okay now brother
[1:13:09] branham we've got this laid out about
[1:13:11] the 5:48 and the perfect number now how
[1:13:14] do we do it and then he start writing
[1:13:17] down don't do this don't do that
[1:13:19] quit doing this do that do all these
[1:13:21] things he doesn't do that he goes
[1:13:23] immediately to Ephesians forward how are
[1:13:29] you gonna be perfect I didn't write the
[1:13:34] book it says by the fivefold ministry
[1:13:38] right we don't want this one okay how
[1:13:45] should we Ephesians 4 chapter and begin
[1:13:47] with the 12 verse he's in for 12 and
[1:13:49] again with the twelfth verse alright
[1:13:51] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:13:52] prophets remember last night don't try
[1:13:55] to take the other man's office National
[1:13:57] Adoption right and some evangelists and
[1:14:00] some pastors and some teachers for the
[1:14:03] perfecting of God does it read that like
[1:14:07] that congregation says no now he said
[1:14:12] the perfection of what Saints
[1:14:16] listen Saints who are the Saints now you
[1:14:25] can go through all that definition we
[1:14:27] know who the Saints are they're in
[1:14:28] Christ okay great but give what a saying
[1:14:30] who are the Saints the sanctified ones
[1:14:33] listen the ones that started from down
[1:14:36] here the ones that started from down
[1:14:41] here at faith the ones that started with
[1:14:47] a new birth and all of that will be for
[1:14:51] the perfecting or the work of the
[1:14:54] ministry the ministry Jesus Christ for
[1:14:56] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:15:00] we all come into the unity of the faith
[1:15:02] and the knowledge of the Son of God into
[1:15:06] the perfect man unto the assurance oh my
[1:15:09] to the measure of the stature of the
[1:15:11] fullness of Christ now you know yourself
[1:15:14] what I've always talked to you you show
[1:15:17] me any other thing any other scripture
[1:15:19] that shows you anything other than the
[1:15:21] fivefold ministry for the perfecting the
[1:15:23] Saints I want to see it I want to see a
[1:15:25] quote from the Prophet I mean I want to
[1:15:28] see a quote I want to see a scripture or
[1:15:31] a quote that perfection will come any
[1:15:34] other way than the fivefold ministry
[1:15:40] well you know if that's true if that's
[1:15:46] true I believe it is that's leaving back
[1:15:48] that away but if that's true then if we
[1:15:52] don't accept the fivefold ministry
[1:15:53] there's no hoax or perfection now we
[1:15:57] read when we started off that they were
[1:16:00] was going to be no rapture without these
[1:16:02] virtues we
[1:16:04] we're quoting it at least and there's
[1:16:05] gonna be no resurrection without these
[1:16:08] virtues all right now he's putting it
[1:16:12] too far for ministry but I just can't
[1:16:14] believe it I agree with you now I don't
[1:16:16] know how arguing with nobody this goes
[1:16:18] out on internet but I got no argue with
[1:16:20] nobody I wouldn't listen to the biggest
[1:16:22] portion of the ministers of this message
[1:16:23] myself I don't have time to fool around
[1:16:25] I don't mean that
[1:16:29] derogatory or nice theory and I just
[1:16:31] mean the truth I ain't going to sit and
[1:16:34] listen to somebody that taste has to
[1:16:36] tell me what you need to be perfect is
[1:16:38] you need to quit this now if we could
[1:16:39] just get our women straightened up if we
[1:16:41] could get all them women it's always the
[1:16:44] preacher is always picking on the women
[1:16:46] it's never the preacher picking on the
[1:16:47] men the man's got the money it's always
[1:16:54] picking on the women well I kept quoting
[1:16:57] that until finally you know there is a
[1:16:59] direct quote on is your life or the
[1:17:02] gospel there is a direct quote another
[1:17:05] drug around there is your wife worthy of
[1:17:07] the gospel now read the message you'll
[1:17:11] find it I don't think he's picking on
[1:17:14] women to you I think he was talking
[1:17:18] about the bride
[1:17:20] but listen even if he was talking about
[1:17:24] it why should we not be willing to take
[1:17:26] the correction that goes with it as I
[1:17:31] said the other night about the virtues
[1:17:32] in sight if we say we need them if we
[1:17:35] say we don't have them and we need them
[1:17:37] were to be on her knees crying out to
[1:17:39] God and all I'm doing is trying to tell
[1:17:45] you what he's saying that the Bible says
[1:17:46] what is for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:17:49] the fivefold ministry why because
[1:17:53] they're supposed to brain and brother
[1:17:54] branham I gave you a quote out of statue
[1:17:56] of a perfect man he said to file full
[1:17:58] ministry to bring these things into
[1:18:00] being how is the virtuous gonna come
[1:18:03] into be there's one thing for sure you
[1:18:06] order no they brother Dale hollers and
[1:18:08] screams enough to your to have patience
[1:18:10] by now so I've done that much now
[1:18:15] waiting all the old brothers you take on
[1:18:17] wounds and are
[1:18:17] because I've at least got the people to
[1:18:19] patience why cuz I screamed and hollered
[1:18:21] for 40-something years trying to get
[1:18:24] people to this place
[1:18:25] alright you pick up and take it on cause
[1:18:28] it's a 5-4 minutes right in one fold
[1:18:31] well I'm rather short so well no brother
[1:18:35] so annoying outside the five fold
[1:18:36] ministry I don't care what his name is
[1:18:38] I don't care who he is or what he's
[1:18:40] saying he ain't outside the five fold
[1:18:42] ministry brother branham was outside the
[1:18:44] five fold ministry cuz he was a
[1:18:45] messenger to the aged but the others is
[1:18:50] in the five fold ministry so anybody
[1:18:51] that the Brother sewing souls in the
[1:18:53] five fold ministry he's only in the five
[1:18:55] full minutes just like everybody else in
[1:18:56] the five full minutes which means
[1:18:58] there's apostles prophets evangelists
[1:18:59] pastors which means we gotta have all
[1:19:01] five of them not one well all we needed
[1:19:06] Lulu is a teacher uh uh you see who I
[1:19:10] bring in I try to bring in people that
[1:19:13] are evangelists or more up being than
[1:19:16] beating than I am and more you know to
[1:19:19] preach to you the things you can
[1:19:21] comprehend and and follow along the line
[1:19:24] because that's for the perfecting I'm
[1:19:29] buddy holler and scream at you for weeks
[1:19:31] and months and some brother come walking
[1:19:33] in don't know a thing in the world and
[1:19:35] then he starts preaching and all at once
[1:19:37] everybody says glory hallelujah I see
[1:19:40] that now
[1:19:41] well okay we got it it's a five full
[1:19:46] minute you know what I gotta have a
[1:19:48] fivefold ministry I've got to have a
[1:19:50] pasture well I thought you was the
[1:19:54] pastor the pastor's gotta have a pastor
[1:19:58] who you gonna pay you tithe to you got
[1:20:01] to pay you power tithe to the pastor
[1:20:03] know who you're gonna pay it to it you
[1:20:05] can't send Ertz jefferson bill I'm sorry
[1:20:06] I'll put it bluntly playing because
[1:20:08] that's where I am some people ain't
[1:20:10] gonna like that but you can't send your
[1:20:11] time to Jeffersonville oh you can do
[1:20:14] better now since Joseph has announced
[1:20:15] that he's a pastor of that you can send
[1:20:18] it that's fine but you know what I'm
[1:20:20] talking about for 40 years he ain't
[1:20:22] declared that and people just flooded
[1:20:24] the money desire but you got to give you
[1:20:28] Todd to where your pastors
[1:20:33] what are you listening are you listening
[1:20:37] this simple little thought go ahead to
[1:20:44] number seven continuation of the reading
[1:20:46] from where we're at from the statue of a
[1:20:49] perfect man perfect godliness you have
[1:20:53] to add to your faith godliness see you
[1:20:57] start off down here with virtue then you
[1:21:02] go to knowledge then you go to templates
[1:21:04] then you go to places then now now your
[1:21:08] own godliness godliness oh my our times
[1:21:11] are not two but you know what godliness
[1:21:13] means we sing the song could be like
[1:21:16] Jesus godliness how do we achieve to
[1:21:21] godliness now is it true musicians come
[1:21:29] on is it true that in the Old Testament
[1:21:32] they had a high priest trying to give an
[1:21:36] illustration now so following it is it
[1:21:38] true under the Old Testament they had a
[1:21:40] high priest it was not the
[1:21:43] second-in-command that made the
[1:21:44] sacrifices right he wasn't a god that
[1:21:49] was in training to be the high priest to
[1:21:51] come up after this high priest died or
[1:21:53] you get what I mean you can't put it on
[1:21:56] something else the high priest was the
[1:21:57] only one that could take the sacrifice
[1:22:01] he's the only one that could go behind
[1:22:03] and come out alive maybe not carrying
[1:22:09] nothing but come out alive meant that
[1:22:12] the people had been accepted right you
[1:22:16] remember what the story they had a rope
[1:22:17] tied to him and had to bail tonight if
[1:22:19] they stopped they took the rope started
[1:22:21] pulling because nobody couldn't go back
[1:22:22] there they had to drag him out if he was
[1:22:26] dead meant to something wrong then it
[1:22:28] had to get everything right
[1:22:29] hey come on if I had high priests I'd
[1:22:32] have said to Moses and Moses no boy no
[1:22:35] check me one more time to make sure that
[1:22:38] I'm right what God told you to dress me
[1:22:40] is everything in place he's my hair comb
[1:22:43] right
[1:22:44] he's my everything my ride and he says
[1:22:49] far as I know I said okay I'll go go
[1:22:52] don't want no problem because it was the
[1:22:54] only one can go behind the veil then
[1:22:57] we're not trying to go behind the veil
[1:22:59] of five full ministry that's where they
[1:23:00] messed it up see they think that brother
[1:23:02] Branham brought a message now that gotta
[1:23:03] go get a message we don't have to go get
[1:23:05] a message this message was brought by
[1:23:07] the Prophet now I've preached that to
[1:23:09] you so you don't have no right to frown
[1:23:11] upon me about it you know that that's
[1:23:12] true we don't have a message well
[1:23:15] brother Branham come to introduce hey
[1:23:18] I've been through all of that I've
[1:23:20] listened to that in the 70s when a man
[1:23:23] sit in my house and said something I
[1:23:27] said yeah I know what y'all teach you
[1:23:29] teach it brother Branham just swept off
[1:23:30] the foundation but now you got to build
[1:23:32] a building but I said do you ain't got
[1:23:33] no quote from brother Branham and you
[1:23:35] ain't got no Bob Walker he didn't like
[1:23:39] it but that's all right I'm sorry he
[1:23:41] asked me and I told him if you don't
[1:23:43] want to know nothing from this old war
[1:23:45] don't ask him right I'm the baddest
[1:23:48] Terrence on that you asked if you want
[1:23:51] to know something terrorists just ask
[1:23:52] him if you don't want to know what he
[1:23:54] got to say you better not asking because
[1:23:57] he's more blunt than I am he's preached
[1:23:59] he told Sunday school one time five
[1:24:02] minutes and quit he ain't done it since
[1:24:03] then I told you I said you don't want me
[1:24:08] over here I don't mean anything wrong
[1:24:12] about it he just straight honest you
[1:24:15] know but that's the guys we need behind
[1:24:17] us thank God for that but do you
[1:24:20] understand what I'm driving at what is
[1:24:22] it to be godliness it's to be like God
[1:24:25] and God is perfect then if he requires
[1:24:30] us to be perfect
[1:24:31] he makes away and it's still his blood
[1:24:34] to make you and I had to come to the
[1:24:37] place to be in perfect being complete
[1:24:39] being to a finish of all things bring Mr
[1:24:46] godliness the brother Brown said you've
[1:24:49] come all this way and said now they
[1:24:53] requires that you be perfect
[1:24:58] well that order show us then that
[1:25:02] somewhere down through there he had to
[1:25:04] bypass a lot of things if he's anybody
[1:25:07] ever reached that garden in this he had
[1:25:09] to bypass a lot of things you say well
[1:25:12] brother Dale where are you at what is it
[1:25:13] I've only told you one time that God
[1:25:15] spoke to me he said to me one day he
[1:25:21] said if you'll have patience with the
[1:25:25] people said it'll prove you got patience
[1:25:28] you know heart ain't proved it got
[1:25:30] patience yet cuz I don't I get all upset
[1:25:36] I still got that down in that virtue and
[1:25:38] that temperance and things I get upset
[1:25:40] because we don't follow the word but to
[1:25:42] work what I get upset at coz we won't
[1:25:44] listen to the true word we want some
[1:25:47] other big thing to tantalize our ears
[1:25:49] and think instead of reading how do we
[1:25:51] come perfect the fivefold ministry your
[1:25:54] prophet just said that and without the
[1:25:57] fivefold ministry there's no way to be
[1:25:59] perfect they didn't maybe water settled
[1:26:08] I am but it's like I've said and I'll
[1:26:11] say it again I'm not gonna listen to a
[1:26:13] lot of em preachers I try to claim to be
[1:26:15] preachers they don't come in here to
[1:26:16] preach ain't gonna let them come in here
[1:26:20] to preach to you some garbage can that
[1:26:22] they've got the great glory bypasses
[1:26:24] sometimes now get caught I have to come
[1:26:27] back and straighten it out you know but

[1:26:32] gonna leave things dangling you know I'm
[1:26:36] gonna do the best I can to try to bring
[1:26:38] us all to perfection and perfection is

[1:31:01] father we thank you this day and we have

[1:31:06] said but we waited a long time on this
[1:31:09] studies and contemplating on this Lord
[1:31:12] to try to get us to see there is a
[1:31:15] possibility of coming to perfection
[1:31:17] there's a possibility of a human being
