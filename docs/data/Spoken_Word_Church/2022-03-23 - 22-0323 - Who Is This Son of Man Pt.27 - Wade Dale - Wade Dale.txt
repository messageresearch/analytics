him i like what brother brown was talking about the fivefold ministry that's where you're going to get it from you're not going to get it set at home hello somebody i'm going to get it sitting at home i can't understand why people can do that and the prophet sits right there and tells them exactly what to do and they don't do it they got their own idea man i would just uh i would just uh the two sundays i was out when i had coveted i about went crazy i told you and i said we gotta get back to church i don't see how people sit at home watch i know some people have to do that some people have to and thank god that that we're able to send it out and a good quality now this is some good quality stuff that we got here and thank the lord that we've got good quality people to run it amen amen and thank god they're spirit-filled men because you know what happened if they weren't hmm everybody's quiet get a little testy maybe every once in a while but they've done a good job man it's it's clear it's real clear but we thank god that that uh that we've uh come this far we were mom and i and dad were cleaning out the back with the some of the cds and i saw some of the cassettes in the back go put on a cassette i ain't even talking about eight inch reels i'm talking about go put a cassette on that we did in what was them 95 96 and then come on a little bit and just keep listening but you listen to the quality it sounded horrible back in the 90s you couldn't hardly hear some of the things that was going on ask christine about the where's sister christina about the seal tapes yeah kind of hard wasn't it uh yeah she was transcribing the seals from brother dale in 1982 and it was it's a little rough but now we've got some good quality stuff and we've got good quality people and thank god remember sunday brother bob will be preaching for us also brother ryan will be doing sunday school for you brothers and sisters and also brother luis will be doing wednesday next a week from today uh remember us this weekend we'll be going to ohio uh leaving friday morning early for the boy in maine june um by louise and sister christine so remember us as we travel uh it's gonna be cold up there but that's okay i like cold weather don't bother me a bit maybe warm people up there though they're warm folks and we appreciate them so we're going to go up there and anoint the church for them and might get into some might get into some light sunday i told brother joe canada this afternoon i said man the spirit of the lord failed sunday in this room and we worshiped i want to see us do that i want you to feel free to worship feel free to shout feel free to cry feel free to express your feelings to your god amen because we the we're the only people that know who who to really fellowship with we're the only people that know the one true and living god intimate with him and being intimate with him then we can be we can come to a place where it doesn't matter if the person over on this side of you or this side of you is just singing the songs if god's ready to strike you let him strike amen we've had enough of the devil striking us i hope y'all have enough of that yeah i get it five or six days a week out there in the outside world and and on sunday so that's why i like coming to church because we gather all of our licks of fire together and we can burn that rascal amen he's going to get burnt but we're going to burn him now amen also remember we will have bible study on april the whatever it is first saturday in april remember that and our subject is the rapture of the millennium and the future home isn't that what we were talking about the rapture because we were going in progression what's going to happen at the rapture what's going to happen in the millennium and what's going to happen in the future home so just keep us in prayer and please show up if y'all keep showing up we're gonna have to get a auditorium to get us get all of us in because it's tough down there in that common room with 30 or 40 people in it so but you come on we'll make it we'll do something also remember the april the 15th 16th and 17th brother joel forney will be here on friday brother homer longoria will be here saturday and keep remembering him because this week he's got one more roto-rooter job on his heart and we pray that they'll get all that and man get all that plaque off of him and out of his arteries and then on the 17th brother mike ulti will be here and also just for your information in july the third that sunday we'll have a special meeting brother chris long's gonna be doing it that'll be our 51st anniversary so that we'll meet there just like we did last year so just remember all these things in your prayers um we got some good ministers we've got we've had some good ones come in brother matthew did a good job this weekend thank you again for all your help this weekend really really enjoyed the services it all goes smooth when everybody helps and man when people scatter and go home that makes the people that stay here mad sorry holy ghost people can get mad i'm sorry they can they just don't stay mad amen and don't say bad words at you so let's go to john 1 one and and just for a little uh background again like we were last week and i want to bring something out tonight that i hope you enjoy we've been meditating on some things and i hope you meditate there's your quiet time i mean if you want to meditate with god yeah meditate with him let him talk to you and it's an intimate relationship amen so being intimate with god and say look i need some help lord or i need this or i need that or and sometimes it might not be a physical need uh maybe it's emotional or maybe spiritual you know maybe something that you a question that you have that's why i like questions and answers brother dale has had questions and answers in this church for 30 or 40 years and that really helps the people it helps you to not have questions what's hard is when you go to another place and you preach and then they haven't been taught and you leave more questions than you do then you and you shouldn't do that but but the way we minister and the way we preach we we try to bring you know some some meat along with the potatoes and um and sometimes it causes people to have a lot of questions and i i i'll tell you one little story it's happened about three times i'm preaching at another three different churches and and you know you're never gonna get called back when the people start asking you questions and um the pastor's not included so you won't get called back to that church i promise you i don't know why they do that i know they try to protect their sheep but if they're sheep starving that's what brother adam was talking about you didn't want to feed them uh what do you call it fireweed or ragweed or whatever that was yeah what yeah loco weed whoa now that's what i'm getting into now brother brown said loco weed you've seen some of these doctrines around it's white local weed amen so so thank god we got some good green pastures amen to eat on so let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day lord that you give us this middle of the week service lord that we can shed off some of the some of the cares of life and sit down just a few minutes lord under the anointing of the holy spirit and listen to you lord and lord it may each heart be touched tonight father there be any sick among us you said you sent your word and healed them lord we have many that that are sick not in the building lord and we pray that you would bless them lord our confession is that by your stripes they're already healed and lord may they walk into it may we all walk into it lord then we'll walk one day we'll walk right into that body change lord somebody's gonna do it and you've already made a way so let it be us lord let us be the one that takes the baton that takes the that takes the revelation lord that you give us in this hour and give it to the people lord we pray lord as you be with the foreign missions lord bless each one there all the little bride around the world lord we pray that you'd be with each one forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord and may we just for a few minutes let you speak to the people father in jesus name we pray amen john 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god verse 14 and the word was made flesh that's important he didn't stay just the word that word became flesh and we'll get into that in a few minutes because you got to have a foundation to get from to get somebody redeemed you got to have a foundation all right and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now let's go to romans 8 verse 18 for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared now watch worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now that paul is prophesying there was a revelation for him to get in his time so that revelation was revealed in us at that time a.d whatever that is being spoken 80 50 80 60. but now remember that's past that's past that revelation we got to have plus because we got to have a revelation of the son of man as uh men somebody else was talking the other day god never goes backwards now he'll go get you but he'll never he'll never take his word backwards he'll never reveal you this and then say all right well now next time i'm going to reveal no he moves forward always moving and where is he moving he's always moving up so we've got to move out listen to me close we got to move out of just a revelation of the son of god that we get born again and we have a happy time you know what brother brown said get just enough to get born again live a good life go to church and pass away that's not the son of man ministry we can stay where we're at or we can move up to the son of man ministry but we can't move up and then move back we can go back and get somebody and bring them to this pot that's why brother branham had to be the the first fruit part jesus was the first fruit but brother brown became the first fruit here the first one to come to maturity besides jesus the first one to come to what adoption the first one to come to speaking the word the first one to come to the third pull to what to do what show us it can be done and show us what is going to happen when it happens an example how the world are you going to know an example of something if you don't know anything about it there's no example there like like going to like we're going to ohio um oh you may be seated y'all want to stand up and keep you from going to sleep so you can sit down now i'm sorry but like we're going to ohio and i don't have one i don't have one inkling of what lorraine ohio looks like but i looked it on google maps and i know where it's at because you know why somebody's been there before somebody has mapped it out before and we don't have a google we've got a god it's already been there he's already seen it in his own mind he's seen the whole thing develop he saw the plan before the foundation of the world and he's just waiting on us to fulfill that time that he's already seen amen but let's get into this right here let's go to um well let's finish reading this for i reckon that's the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so it's got to be revealed in people and it's plural not singular revealed in us not not me the great one and nobody else is going to get it no god's not that way for the earnest expectation of the creature our creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god and as i've said many times before you look in the sixth seal and you see where there's a total disruption of nature brother brown said earthquakes happen tornadoes whatever all that can be called by those two prophets but guess where those two prophets get that anointing from they get that anointing from the bride because right around the coming of the lord we're going to need all that third pull we're going to need that speaking condition we're gonna god's gonna need you to say god needs yeah god needs because he needs him before jesus to fulfill his plan god decided he can't do this by himself i said god decided he couldn't do this by himself with this plan of redemption it takes people it takes people it takes a bride it takes somebody that's alive amen the resurrection message was to live people those angels didn't turn around and look out in the graveyard and say he's not here he's risen know what it was it was to those live people that were standing in front of them to that congregation that come to church and listen to what god had to say for the earnest expectation do we have an expectation you should be expecting listen we expect everything else what's russia going to do what's ukraine going to do what's this one going to do have you ever said what's god going to do have you ever said what's god going to do god what are you going to do today no we get up and say what's my job going to do is my car going to start is my bill's going to get paid is that postal guy going to deliver my mail to me my bills they don't like me sometimes when i deliver all the bills to them but but if we ever changed our as ernie villanueva said our thinking thinking have we reversed that thing to where we are expecting god when we put our feet on the ground what's god going to do for us today or what's god going to do because remember the day starts with you now i'm not trying this is not a feel-good message but when you wake up and put your feet on the floor if you're a bride of jesus christ there is something about that day or the day to come and you're going to sometimes go brother wait i don't even feel like i'm alive well you you got up you are alive all right you did go do something i was listening to brother branham in the adoption series darn he's talking about going back through the adoption series again that brother brown preached he brother brown never said anything about being some great something a little washed woman going about her duties brother brown i'm positionally placed i want to be this everybody wants to be a preacher everybody wants to speak in tongues why can't you just come to church that's a victory for some of y'all a lot of y'all said amen but he said the man with his lunch box under his arm going to work but they got the holy ghost if you got the holy ghost something's going to happen in your life whether you see it or not you're going to influence somebody and that's why we talk about predestinated to adoption we're walking this path that we're on uh thinking about this this morning a little bit or yeah this morning and then you you see that we're on this path god's already know he already knows what it is but you and i don't remember but remember we must be prophetic people in this end time there is a map there is a google earth there is a god that's already seen what you gonna do but now i'm gonna tell you something though like brother matthew was preaching this weekend you're a free moral agent yes or no take it or reject it have a good day or have a bad day right and god is orchestrating what you're going to meet all during the day brother brown said god god will have a brother say something to you to see how you'll react you know what he said god not the devil we blame the devil on all this stuff that we do he said god will put somebody in your in in front of you to see what you'll do about that situation now who's it for not for god not for the guy that spoke it our sister let's don't leave the sisters out the god that spoke it or the sister or brother is for you and how are you it's not like well they stomped off and i don't know why i'm doing this but i'm doing it anyway they stomped off they didn't listen to what i had to say well maybe it was your attitude did you come in a forgiveness attitude instead of a it ain't my fault hey listen this is positionally placing this is adoption i'm not talking about just i'm not talking about just being a good christian because you listen you can be a good christian and not have all these virtues from from from uh 80 30 on the day of pentecost until today there is people that's born again that's not god the virtue that you and i have knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you know i wonder sometimes i was reading in the bible i went back through matthew mark luke and john because that is the son of man and that is his characteristics if you want to know what the character the son of man is read matthew martin luke and john because that's the man doing it himself jesus stands up one day and he says i have not come to bring peace now wait a minute through the whole bible he's the prince of peace amen prince of peace mighty god everlasting father he stands up one day and he says i didn't come to bring peace but a sword i have caused a division between father and son mother daughter i have caused that what it's the preaching of the word of the son of man listen we can be mr goody two shoes that's okay but you know what jesus was doing though he was doing it with a heart trying to save them and is that what you're doing it with that's what a pastor like you see brother dale you know a lot of times years ago i may have told you this before but i'll tell it again because it always struck me i thought i thought well man brother dale he's just he's just the best pastor and he don't have no problems and there's nobody you know doing anything wrong in the church and yeah foolish me when i asked when i was out in the world but brother dale would come to my house he'd come to my house later on after y'all got done with him one more time after y'all got done with him some of you were here some of you weren't back in the in the early 90s he come to my house on sunday afternoon he'd say let's watch a hunting video and he'd sit down and he wouldn't say a word and i knew there's something bothering him it was y'all it wasn't me because i wasn't sitting there i'm just kidding but he would i mean the the toil of all that pressure that you don't see that's why a lot of times the decisions are made if a lot of things are done and and and you wonder why it's done well you don't know everything about what's going on but a pastor knows every little minute detail even though he's got discernment by from the lord and sometimes just common sense to see what's going on in the church and not have somebody to come up and confess everything that they're doing and and oh my heavens let's get out of here i will go home i don't i don't deal with this no i don't want to deal with this anymore but you know what it's part of the job and brother dale never shunned that job we got a lot of good pastors that never shunned that job they don't shun that job we've seen people run from it but not around here but if you preach the word of god like i'm gonna read here just a minute ago teaching places of man in the body and what does it do it settles the church so that's what it's done it's settled the church but now as settling the church now can we get too settled yeah we can build that nest and we can wiggle we can wiggle our tail in it and get real soft remember the eagle she puts all those beautiful feathers in that right at first because when you lay the egg you don't want the thorns to stick through the egg and kill the little chicken right but you wait till that little chick is our little eagle is hatched what's mama start doing she don't want you to stay in that nest all the time she wants you to learn to fly so she starts pulling them feathers out give you a little trial give you a little temptation give you a little sore spot and then what are you doing now you're doing this and then you're gonna fly away and that's what god wants us to do and what am i saying grow up we need to all grow up just a little bit more because that's what we're predestinated to and adoption is not babies adoption is for mature adults they'll be okay with that amen so let's go to ephesians one paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which at ephesus to the faithful in christ jesus we're going to read here in ephesus and see what like we were talking about sunday this is our pre-this is our predestination this is our predetermined god saw somebody was going to come to it you just got to match that piece you've got to match that peace that god saw before the foundation of the world it's got to literally happen jesus was crucified in in the mind of god before the foundation world but there had to come a time 2 000 years ago that he literally went through this you know why because you weren't predestinated to just go from baby to an adult christian with no trials trials build character jesus went through trials and built character so don't think we're not going through them but look it's not it's not that we're not going to have them but we'll know how to handle them we know how to come out on the other end of victor amen not beat down we come back and we come out of this thing as a victor how many trials have you ever had that you just lost everything and it just it just stayed that way no way no way if you stayed in one battle for 20 years you ain't died or something happened i don't know what's going on you need to fight that one kill it and go to the next one that's what we talk about with with joshua joshua never lingered in one place they kept battling because he had to give this to this land he had to give this and that's what the ministry is doing now they're battling with you to get you this part because look i wrote myself a little note remember moses moses was the prophet moses was commissioned to what bring them out but not take them in bring them out with a strong hand all right so he brought them out in a prophetic ministry everybody with me brought him out in a prophetic ministry didn't place them but got them right at the land right on the border and then what happened god said okay you've done what i want you to do now i've got joshua a type of the holy ghost is one that's going to place you all right we've had a prophet in the end time i'm just telling you the way it is we've had a prophet in the end time he brought us to a place he brought us to where he showed us everything the seals everything was open and he could see the promised land but i believe he knew he wasn't going to make it all the way because he was prophesying all down through there and then all of a sudden 1965 he's gone that didn't just happen because it happened it had a purpose moses thy servant is dead but his ministry was not joshua was the fulfillment of moses's ministry you and i are the fulfillment of the prophet of the end times ministry the final voice to the final age will have to be the bride listen let's just get in let's just get into this nitty gritty brother branham was he brought us what back to the faith of the fathers he gave us the most beautiful foundation the zerubbabel to build on and he built it up but he built it in prophecy not reality he built it in prophecy there was nobody in the sixth seal i've been read that a hundred times to you you're not getting it it's not for you you're in this part right here get this and stay happy because there's a group coming over here that's gonna get it now there's no other group but you and i there's no other group but the bride of jesus christ matured in the end time that's going to take the seals you know i agree with some some of the brothers say that the seals are not open to a lot of people they're not they literally closed the book back up but remember god's the only one who can open a book god's only one who can close the book so he what do you do when you close a book you do what you blind them how many times the bible tells us that you've got eyes and can't see you got ears and can't hear you're blinded by what you're seeing i mean really that's you're being blinded by what you're looking at but you're not really seeing or getting the prophecy you're not getting what's behind all that um brother isaac sent me a uh marco polo the other day and we were discussing something earlier and he said he said brother you didn't even mention nothing about the seals as a joke so i sent him back i said i said no i was talking about him all the time i said you just didn't get the love letter you didn't get the in-between you didn't get the revelation i said you you were just reading on paper and that's what we're doing and that the bri the bride does not just read on paper joshua absolutely he acted on what moses brought he didn't change the ten commandments to ten suggestions amen he acted on that and took a people a group of people into the promised land had to circumcise several of them again you know i was thinking about that it's kind of funny it is it's only further in my notes but i'll tell you now it seemed like moses never had time to do anything wasn't brother brown about the same way he had a message to brain though he had a purpose sure he had family sure he had this but but here's moses listen he's the one that told the people from abraham to moses he said eighth day circumcise your kids he has circumcised one person i mean if he you know if he was supposed to be this bringing this commission and this whole group over here is going to have to be circumcised again they were standing there when moses was on top of that mountain getting ready to die or go wherever he was going and then moses getting ready to go to the to the to the uh to egypt didn't even circumcise his own kids there's a lot of things you put out there's a lot of things that the prophet to god we think man he was sure he was a great man but he he had to literally single himself out only see his wife two or three times a year sometimes how many sisters you put up with that well some of you could put up a lot but that's okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to go there some of you would be slap happy to do that but anyway some of you wouldn't jim wouldn't she doesn't shook her head no that's my baby but look what moses had to give up look what brother brown had to give up but now remember but look at joshua here joshua goes into the promised land he doesn't give up anything he knows what to do circumcise them people get them ready and then god gives him commission as i was with moses i'll be with you same thing with me and you tonight as i was with the prophet i'll be with you because if he was a prophet he told us we were prophetic people so we should understand the prophetic we should understand that that god sent us a prophet but he sent us a prophetic message through that prophet that prophet's gone off the scene but what he said joshua acted on what the prophet said you and i as the fivefold ministry should be acting on what the prophet said not a suggestion everybody all right paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which is us at ephesus and remember ephesus was a grown group of people big old powerful church had a big great auditorium 12 people but they were all full of the holy ghost give me a church full of the holy ghost every person that walks in the door that's my prayer is that everybody gets the holy ghost not an anointing but against the real baptism of the holy ghost that's my prayer and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ now watch what he's telling tell us now watch so this is this is prophetic look at verse three let's go to the next there you go in the mind of god before time we were doing this the other day so let's go through it again every time i say us you need to say us i know it's wednesday night you know we get a lot of volume out of you but please say us okay let's practice man that's good let's be the god father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ so now when you get born again that sits you in a heavenly place oh brother i had nothing but trouble you're looking at circumstances your soul is god if you're born again your soul is almighty god you've just got it so encapsulated and so you've got that you've got that i watched them uh guys across the road they're making pots and they start with just a big old lump of clay and you know how that is and they start to wheel you know i think man that is that's art but that's what god did but you know what our problem is we close that sucker up we we don't let it out how have i been telling you let it out let what you got out our humanity gets in god's way more than anything amen so let's work on our humanity if that's one thing it gets in god's way let's work on it oh but brother we i'm i don't want to hear that anymore i'm telling you what the bible says who has blessed with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen in him before the foundation of the world that should be holy and without blame before him in love now that's what we're working on when you got born again your soul yes it was as holy as it'll ever be it never sinned never going to sin that's what we got to realize that thing that's inside of you is already sealed up it's already ready to go in a rapture your rapture started the day you got born again but the rest of you got to catch up because we were born in sand shaped and iniquity but see that's the plan and that's okay god that's all right god's got it all done it's all figured out it just takes our free moral agency to plug ourselves into that all right is everybody okay with that and it's not just like and i like what brother matthew said if you watch some preachers like brother matthew if you talk about the seed and you talk about these different things if they throw out three free moral agency get away from it but if they'll always come back to free moral agency that settles the whole deal that makes the doctrine correct when you take for it's your it's your choice i know god saw you before the foundation world i know you're sitting in heavenly places i'm reading it on the screen it's the bible but you gotta plug yourself into them amen that we should we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will which is his what word to the praise of the glory of his grace now look god don't need grace he is grace so what are you talking about it's not about us we need grace he's extending the grace to us we're in he hath accepted made the beloved which is jesus christ listen we're already accepted if you're born again tonight you're already accepted there's that wide foundation but look as we go up this statue of perfect man though look how it narrows it narrows because number one not everybody's gonna attain to it i'm just telling you sorry not everybody but whoever attains to it you've got to have a lot more faith than you do virtue a lot more faith than you do knowledge it all starts with faith because i'll read you this quote in just a second when i get finished with this so now that was all in the mind of god he accepted us before the foundation of the world he went to the cross and died to what to make sure that that would happen to make sure that you and i would be released that you and i would be to where we could make a choice now let's go to the next on earth here's redemption in whom that was totally weak in whom have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of whose grace his grace we're in he has a bounded toward in all wisdom and prudence now that's what that's growth you're heading into some growth here everybody with me having made known unto the mystery of his will wow according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself that's why that look that in the dispensation what is our dispensation now son of man that's our dispensation that in the dispensation of the fullness of times what right here at the end two thousand years listen redemption is fiction to be this plan of redemption for the gentiles is fixing to be over i mean totally over no more gentiles will be saved god will only go to the jews and he'll only save others at the white throne judgment under what they did and what they didn't do is everybody okay with that so this thing this plan that he started from the garden of eden literally i'm talking about literally from the garden of eden until until now is fixing to be culminated in a bride taking a body change and going up and god coming back to the jews everybody all right with that but we got some growing to do look that he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also have obtained an inheritance you had to make a choice god knew your choice but you had to make a choice that's why that that that in in one page of a book brother brown says you were saved before the foundation of the world you weren't saved on any certain day and then five pages later he said your eternal life begins at the altar he's not confused that was done in the mind of god this is literally what's going to do you're going to receive it right here that's what me and brother bob was talking about you know you somebody tells you uh it's really you don't have to have a lot of discernment but they they say i got born again i got born again i know i got born again wake her up thank you you can't listen when i was close i got born again and you do the same thing you'd been doing you don't change groups that you hang around you don't change places that you go used to go to you didn't get born again no no no you did not get born again listen everybody that i see that i believe is born again you didn't bring your friends in this church did you hello no i'd be scared to death i'm sorry they would be scared to death for me to bring them into the church they would be scared why unfamiliar spirit you had an unfamiliar spirit when you were in the world that's why you didn't come into the church until god saved you right so if you're still doing the things you used to do and hang around with the same people you've been hanging around with you ain't get born again born again will separate you ask that black he's back there in the back you ask him your friends will automatically leave if they're not born again now if they're born again then that's okay you get together and we like we did and fellowship meeting or are you meeting this weekend you come together and you know you read the scripture says of light precious faith well you know what they get together just in like faith it ain't precious but what birds of a feather flock together so if you get born again it'll show prove it it will prove itself i'll agree it's hard young people i know it is i see the world out there but god's greater than anything the world's god his spirit is holy his spirit is stronger than any other spirit that's out there in the world so if you get the holy ghost yeah you're going to have problems but you're going to have you're going to learn that you can deal with them and you'll know where to go to get answers that's the problem with the world out here today they do not know where to go get an answer they watch this program and they watch this one they watch this program and they watch this one and none of them coincide with each other right thank god for the continuity of god's word that it can come together and you get the same answer every time having made it known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together not separate gather together in one not in 20 not in 13 000 different denominations in the message sorry you know there's a lot of times that when jesus was walking on the earth i'm gonna try to pick my words right here i get in trouble for no there's a lot of times that jesus put up with stuff paul did paul put up with that woman that followed him around for all them all them days aggravating him and then all the tanner and all the different ones that paul put up with but one day he turned around and he said you vile spirit i've heard enough of you remember one of them he struck him dumb where he couldn't say another word so he made sure that guy shut up what am i saying jesus did the same thing brother brown did the same thing i don't say he compromised with the with the denominations never but he dealt with them in their time but when he come to the seals and when he come to marriage in divorce he said hundreds i think one place he said thousands of my friends are going to leave me why that's the son of man ministry jesus put up with him pharisees until the very end and he finally said you of your father the devil i've got a different daddy than you do religious world he didn't say that to the prostitute he didn't say that to somebody else he said that to the religious world the son of man listen the son of man ministry will not compromise oh well maybe they uh if it don't ring if it don't that bell don't ring it ain't true one word off today folks one word off that's why some people feel we're too adamant about what we believe you know what the world's adamant about what they believe why can't we be adamant of what we believe amen clap your hands you clap on everything else because jesus stood alone by himself even his disciples didn't understand him because he didn't have the holy ghost but once they got the holy ghost on the day of pentecost they're like we know what he's talking about we know why he did what he did because you know what peter and them did the same thing they stand up in the temple and they're preaching jesus christ they get thrown in jail by who the sinners know by catholicism by all the different religious people and you know what most of them were living under the law blameless paul said in the book of acts he said a pharisee of the pharisees blameless according to the law but he was having christians killed because he didn't move his ministry up to where he's supposed to be that's our problem we talking about by the way we're going to get into positionally placed and we want to positionally place you got to know where to go you got to know you're not in that place or you got to know you are in that place jesus knew where he was at brother brown said jesus knew where he was he was in a world of faith he knew where he was at at every moment now sometimes we do and sometimes we don't sometimes we go what in the world are we doing here but if you're a child of god you're right where you're supposed to be if you yield to that and we'll get into that way later or later on in the the you take manassas and and all those different ones and as long as they stayed in their position they were okay but when one wanted to move somewhere into this one because this one looked better than the other one it's got this one got more property than i got this one's got a better this than i got this one got a better that they started problem listen they started fighting each other in the promised land think about that they started fighting each other after joshua had already placed them where they supposed to go of course that was a natural story but it's also a spiritual story also everybody okay then in a dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which on earth even in him and whom also we've have obtained an inheritance being predestinated by the mind of god according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will which is his that should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom you say we also trusted after that we heard the word of truth after everybody wants to be on top of the ladder without listening to the word or doing what he said the gospel of your salvation and him also after that we believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of the promise you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now that's the foundation that's where that's just where you start growing when you get sealed in with god that's when you start growing everybody okay with that that's when you get started on your journey that's your foundation brother branham many many times i read you a few quotes where brother brown said that's where you pentecostals fail you get into the land you get right there at the border in the land and you think this is it brother brown said no you're just getting started why they needed character listen folks i'm going to say this with with reverence of all the people that we've known from 2 000 years backwards there's nobody projected the the character of the son of man like jesus and like william branham and now it's got to be like the bride it's great listen it's great for us to see i know i don't i don't want to call them relics but there's things that people worship that are back there aaron quit laughing they're they're back there what about here listen i just as soon have a prayer cloth from donny's billfold then i had one that brother branham laid over and prayed over i know we want to hold that deer we want to hold to that but my lord that's moses where's my joshua where's my joshua that's going to place me in a land that's going to help me fight my battles where is that at listen when elijah went up right he's the type of brother branham because he was the third elijah or the second elijah first elijah and number two was standing together but brother brown said elisha topped the bride right so elisha grabs the mantle of elijah and starts running after him and trying to find him no no he's got the mantle he goes to the same river they just crossed and hit that river with that same anointing and said where be the god of elijah he wasn't asking he was telling the world that right here is the same god oh elijah they went he went up and he was in a chariot and oh you ought to see he never said that elisha never stood there for 60 years help me somebody they just he didn't stand there for 60 years and go well i wish he'd come back i i i saw it but i wish he'd come back no that joker grabbed that mantle and he went back across the river and he went over and did twice as many miracles as elijah done so i say tonight where be the god of elijah he's in his bride he's not a relic he's not something that we have to lean on to make sure we get a here i go to make sure i get a lure that looks like one that brother branham yeah that's an ouchie but it happened if y'all didn't know that it did that's okay but man that ain't real to me i wasn't there when that happened i'm gonna get in trouble with this but where are we going to see that you and i it's great that brother brown came to adoption it's great that all these things happen honestly but but i've heard people say that they'd rather listen you know there was a um there was a tape came out that jeffersonville well they put out they just had prayer lines that's okay that kind of gets you motivated kind of gets you faith build up a little bit but there's no growth in that there's no growth in that i gotta hear the word that was in before that because listen if i can preach come on somebody if i can preach the same message he's preaching then i'm going to expect the same result in this prayer line i'm going to accept what happens now if i preach the same message where be the god of elijah amen he's right here you we you us they us brad not to the world i'm losing my voice but that's what we're looking at folks we're looking at this updated revelation and if people want to think that we're different please do amen he was different the world hated him and he was god almighty and human flesh fulfilled every characteristics of that statue of perfect man every one of them you say brotherly kindness yeah he loved him pharisees if they were to listen to what he said but they weren't supposed to he came to the most religious remember was um there they crucified him there the most holy city in the world jerusalem those were god's people they weren't heathens they were god's people because god said you're my people there they who the most religious people in the world were right there in jerusalem listen they didn't have the internet back then nope word of mouth crucified god in the most holy place brother braham said that is what's happening again that is what's happening again i'm like paul in a way that's called heresy please think i'm crazy please call me different when it's according to god brother brown said you're going to be odd anyway he said don't be odd you're going to be on anyway if you'd be a christian an oddball didn't he preaching oddball i'm sure he did all right look let's go to the next one we're not going to get done but we'll get a certain spot and we'll stop so now look which is the earnest of earnest now look you got a house you go and sit down with a lawyer if you like most of us you're poor and ain't got the money to pay for the whole thing at one time you know what we're supporting sin the same thing we couldn't pay for it all at one time but he could he paid for it all at one time but you and i can't but you know what he give us a down payment but remember we are the ones that give the bank the down payment the bank of heaven give them a down payment then as long as you make the payments you know what that that title may not be all in your name but if you if you meet all the requirements meet all the requirements of the payment book at the end of the 30 years or whatever you got the loan for your name goes on that title and there's nobody can take it away from you but before that you goof up guess what free moral agency takes over god takes his house back now don't take his he don't take the new birth back but he anything you need to go up that statue of a perfect man if you stop it then god's going to say okay i can't make you make the payment that's right you choose this day who you'll serve choose this day if you'll make a payment or not but you get the earnest when you get the new birth until what the redemption of the purchased possession what did he what did he possess at calvary body spirit and soul not just your soul he claimed it all unto the praise of his glory everybody all right with that so let's go to number one look he said now preaching usually catches the center brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith watch let me let me not let me interpolate like paul did i don't get in trouble if i interpolate but if i stick it in there myself they say that you're not saying what brother brown said kind of like claude said you can you can misquote the bible or paraphrase the bible and people go it's okay he just didn't he just didn't know the whole scripture but you misquote a quote yeah that's when the phone starts ringing but teaching places a man positionally what he is people are funny and we can never rightly be able to have faith rapturing faith you get faith in your birth but he's talking about positionally placing so i want to put that right there have rapturing faith until positionally you know what you are i mean how in the world are we gonna know where we are if we don't know where we are i mean that's kind of crazy but we're we're christians yeah okay you can be baby christians but will you decide to go higher to get more let's go to number two real quick now what is adoption so let me get this now i don't know whether i have time to get through this if there's a question you can ask me a little bit later your adoption is not your birth now we've already been through that we've separated it and we're going to do a little bit more tonight your adoption is not your birth because the children of israel became the children of israel when god said you're my children knowing they weren't going to do anything he said they took them through he took them through the wilderness brought them out with all those mighty miracles and they hated him we loathe this bread that we get every day that's fresh and good why have you brought us out here to die we'd rather have leeks and garlic back in you see what i'm talking about how people are i'd rather have this back to what we were doing look god don't go back i remember brother dale a long time ago preaching on the you know the israel sin what was it ten times in the wilderness god never said he never said he never gave him a spanking as soon as they would see him he'd say okay when you get in the promised lands he's just talking he's just talking right over that group of people same way with us down through the 2000 years he's put up with father son holy ghost baptism he's put up with a trinity doctrine he's put up with these things but there was a time when he said i've had enough of this my word says this is what you do and you need to start doing it same way that's why brother brown had to come that's why god had to send a prophet he sent a prophet to bring us a positive message that says this is it there is no other no compromise sorry did god compromise oh well that's okay i'm gonna save you anyhow no he's gonna save you because you wanted to be saved you're gonna have to act right you're gonna have to what approach him right approach him with an honest and a contrite heart approach him with a broken heart and then god will save you but your adoption is your placing that's what we're going to get into a little bit later not now when you were born again john 1 17 i believe when you're born again of the spirit of god you're the sons of god but we were predestinated now what brother brown said he said all right you were sons of god you received the new birth but he's referring to we were predestinated unto adoption all right we are sons of god but we are production now here's what i'm trying to get to you for the sons of the last day who that that's us to see we were predestinated unto adoption that's going down a little further but yet that ain't what i'm talking about he's talking about the pentecostals i got the holy ghost listen the true holy ghost fell on the pentecostal people they will be there as bride but they're they were not called to a because god knew they would only take it so far and stop martin luther took it so far not him but the people took it so far and stopped that's why folks we can't stop we cannot stop it's got to be fresh it's got to be a fresh revelation it's got to be something that every day that we don't loathe coming to church we don't loathe having to listen to a tape we don't load this light bread god we literally enjoy it give me some more but remember when he got into promised land what happened that man has ceased and they ate of the old corn of the land they ate what had already been grown up that had already been given to them listen don't get in trouble again you can't really eat the old corn of the land number one not be born again because remember they eat it in the promised land so that's your position it's coming to a position where you're going to be positionally placed but without the message of the hour through a five-fold ministry that's the old corn of the land the manna is anything it drops on everybody the manna dropped on two million israelites that 99 of them were not going to make it to the promised land right joshua and caleb and the ones under 20 years old they were able to eat of the old corn of the land because the manna had ceased once they walked into the promised land god will spoon feed you for so long then he's going to say now you got to go out there in that field and get it for yourself amen but your adoption is your placing everybody got that but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you were predestinated into adoption adoption is placing a son and we'll read that in just a few minutes all right let's go to the first stage of adoption we already talked about this but we'll fly through it pretty quick because in romans 8 verse 14 through 17 we see where paul is talking about for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god listen you can't be the son of a devil and be born again you can't be the son of the devil and be adopted you got to be a son of god you got to be a daughter of god so that's where you start remember brother branham said and we make it to it may not that when those hebrew women had the babies which was the 12 tribes you know when when the bible talks about the children of israel do you know what they're talking about they're talking about everybody because not all israel's israel the children of jacob hello because jacob's name was changed to israel so it's the children of jacob which was reuben gad manasseh all the way down and remember leah had some i'm not gonna break it down leah had some of them rachel had two right which was uh reuben i mean um joseph and thank you joseph and benjamin all right then you had concubines my lord that that had these children of israel that was named the 12 tribes so that's what god's talking about it's talking about the children of israel those 12 tribes listen when they went into that promised land the mixed multitude had died see when they all came out of egypt if you'll watch the the ten commandments the movie the one from whatever in 1930 something that brother brown said you know you could go watch whatever it was charlton heston moses you're as old as he is so anyway uh but you see that that nathan and cora all the different ones they were mixed multitudes they came out with them you just see this whole herd coming out that wasn't all the children of israel because you always got that group that says i think i'll just kind of i think i'll just kind of follow along with them you know if something good happens to them then something good gonna happen to me that ain't what's gonna happen because god don't have that remember he's not a compromiser he swallowed about two hundred and something of them one day and accused moses of killing the people of god they weren't the people of god the ones that went in that hole were not because it was dathan and core a bunch read about them in the bible what we got a lot of now got a lot of death in the car hanging around sorry listen you hang around this message you die spiritually and naturally because you're not going to take a rapture how many people stood at the door of the ark if it was as many people then as they are now there was a spectacle so there was thousands of people around that ark all the time i believe just kind of waiting on let's see if what he preaches is true but remember who shut the door noah didn't want to shut the door god shut the door he said i've had enough and i'll promise you folks they were claw marks on those doors on the outside of the ark when that thing started hitting water but the hebrew children as they were birthed now remember hold on they were birthed over here everybody with me we'll just stop right here because i'm not going to get any further and it's only eight it's 8 25. all right you got the children of israel that were the children of jacob sorry let's start with the children of jacob now they weren't in the promised land they were running around all over the place remember you had you had abraham then you had isaac and jacob let me get it right abraham isaac and jacob jacob that's who we talking about jacob because jacob's name was turned to what israel so they started having babies over here well now then somewhere down the line a pharaoh raised up that didn't know joseph and they got put into captivity for 400 and something years right then when god took him out with a mighty hand they were 40 more years in the wilderness you see your journey see you get born again right here the prophet of god said and there's only one there's only one man could say that brother william marion branham he said they screamed the names of the children and that's what positionally placed them in the land not that group their descendants it was 400 and almost 500 years god waited 500 years to complete the promise of placing those children in the promised land they stayed tribes they stayed in the message they listened to moses then moses leaves joshua takes over and puts some positionally places them prophetically 500 years they were spoken where they were going to be by the by the hebrew women let me read that real quick just so you know i'm not crazy i mean you know i'm crazy but still y'all didn't have to life hurt my feelings anyway quote number eight return and jubilee now we find that when joshua divided the inheritance to the people brothers that's way on down the line that's almost the last quote when joshua divided the inheritance to the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these hebrew mothers named those children how they were placed in palestine just at their place asher gad naptali and each one judah everyone just placed in their position now when they were born by the hebrew mothers they screamed their name and that placed them so see that's why you and i are all predestinated to adoption everybody that gets the new birth you get born again you can come to adoption but what kept them from coming right then they did they did they wandered for 40 years because of who moses no joshua no caleb no they listened to 10 lion preachers that said in message churches saw the glory of god could have preached the glory of god but they listened to 10 people that told them a lie rather than listening to two people who told them the truth guess what god wiped them off he even killed those 10 preachers or 10 10 uh spies or whatever you want to call them but they were liars they lied to the people and the people that rather believe a lie i guess than to believe the truth but what was joshua and caleb looking at they weren't looking at circumstances they were looking at the promise they had faith that god would deliver all of them you know joshua was one of the greatest military leaders it ever was if it hadn't been for aiken how many people did he lose hero brother brown said no red cross right no uh you know they have no hospitals unless aiken did what did what he did unless sin gets in the camp god's gonna accomplish everything he said he's gonna accomplish but despite that he still accomplished everything he was going to accomplish he just had to get rid of aiken and you know what it wasn't just bacon that died his whole family died burn them in the tent where the wedge was and the garment was let's don't get that way but we'll look what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of god placing in the church listen himself every member every stone every place every christian to itself each one of us has in our particular way has a place in the house of god wow like solomon's temple when it was cut out from all the world you remember what happened with the solomon's temple not a sound of a hammer if brother joel canada was here there's david said but good to see you hey buddy and and josiah is it like real quiet when y'all are building a house i mean you can't hear nothing no because what's going on you shrug your solid your hat well you don't hammer anymore you pop but it's a kind of a noisy place in there not when god's temple was built they cut it in another country another country and had it shipped to israel or to jerusalem and it just all fit together it all fit together without the noise of grumbling and complaining and this don't go here and that don't go there and i'm preaching it this way i don't care what you say i'm preaching it that way i if it was done then you say that we can't all agree i disagree i really didn't mean to say that but it sounds pretty good this son of man ministry listen jesus never fought against himself he never took a message back that he preached and he called the people that were one word off the devil snakes vipers oh by the way you're too militant now adam wasn't militant enough and he let satan get under the wall of the garden of eden a son of god a son of god let satan get in because he compromised with his wife on one word brother brown said one word off got him out of the garden he said one word off will not get you back in the garden so yes god i believe will watch over his word and he will have a group of people it may not be me may not be you but somebody in this world i believe is alive today that's going to do that it's going to not compromise with one word off that's gonna preach the word the way it's supposed to be and if you have to preach to the walls he preached to the walls but let's read this last one while we were here while we're at number nine as i was with moses so i'll be with thee now he had to divide the lands and there was 12 tribes to divide it by now what if he had some look what if he had had some picks and pets hmm our pet doctrine what if he'd had some picks and pets what if he liked the tribe again better than he'd like the tribe of ephraim tribe of joseph better than he did judah but he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided it according to tribe and noticed he done it by the revelation by discernment why because he wasn't there when those hebrew women screamed their names that was 500 years that way but the holy spirit didn't forget them brought those names right here and joshua said okay your name's reuben you're going to be your feet and oil we'll read that later on you're going to be with this and you're going to be with this and you're going to be with this and like brother brown said he didn't compromise because you know what everybody wants oil but not everybody gets oil listen god's going to give you what he knows you can handle what he knows you can handle and if we're mature enough you know what we'll do thank you lord you gave me the desert thank you lord i don't have a bit of water but you're the god of water you'll send rain when i need it if i need water i know where i can dig a well because you'll tell me where to dig that well i know that you're going to give me something even in my dry desert but like brother brown said what do we want to do we want to sneak over on ephraim's land because he's got green grass and we want to hurt our people over here i mean our cattle over here right because this one preaches a little more fiery that i'm i'm going there i'm not going there anyway by the discernment of god's spirit he did it so one of those mothers one each one of those mothers giving birth to those babies called their name and each one of their name has a meaning and what's our name tonight the bride of jesus christ not just the bride of jesus christ sister rebecca the bride of jesus christ that will come to adoption that we'll come to we haven't even got to that part yet where we're just now at the place where god gives you the checkbook and he's already got his name written down at the bottom of it right you just refilling what you need and hand it back to him but now what's what's full adoption get the blank check right and you write your name on the bottom and god doesn't go nah i don't think i'll do that no when you get when your name's written on there he knows that you're writing the good check and that's what we got to come to i believe that's what we're looking at just right here right here in front of our nose is we're coming to full adoption because remember look we'll get to it later on full adoption does not that's not the body change well adoption is the second stage the name is good on the checkbook is jesus's name the third pool whatever you want to name it our updated revelation is third pull where that will speak and god will answer all right brother branham didn't go on top of that mountain when he called the storm out of existence i don't even see where he was where he was praying he may have been praying in himself but remember the lord came to him and actually he was worried remember the story he was worried because that storm was coming in and he's trying to get them brothers off the mountain he said i knew i could make it because i'm a woodsman he said but some of them bless their heart probably probably didn't know anything about the woods and they were going to die so he was he was what concerned about his brothers and what god say whatever you say it'll happen and brother brown didn't just say storm go away he said storm go away sun come out and we'll have good weather for three days remember how many days that was he said but he was very specific about what he said storm we got to start first with the storms in our life we got to first start with the storms in our life you call that thing out like somebody was preaching the other day if you don't want it in your house get rid of it and if you get rid of the physical thing that's okay what about let's get rid of the spiritual stuff the spirits that what anoint us to do bad things christians mm-hmm yeah us time to clean house know who you are stand up for who you are and just say it let's stand our feet just say it whatever you need whatever whatever's going on in your life whatever disaster or or you know it's brother zach may have a problem with something that i don't even have a problem with but you know what it's real to him i may have a problem that some of you don't have and but it's real to me and we think oh they should get over that well no hang on a minute if you went through something somebody probably was standing over there going they should go they should be able to handle that it's like i told that girl it works for us at the post office dee was talking to some guy and he's real loud and kind of boisterous and when he left she said i said he's just kind of difficult to be around after he left and i looked at dee and i said we say that about you when you leave the room too so so you got to be careful that's what god will say he'll say i say it about you too buddy put you through a trial like somebody else did and just because you didn't make it out the same way that one did we're all individuals and that was what the placing was reuben if he would have stayed where he was at had been fined but remember they go all the way down and it gets down to where even before david's king judah separates from all of them now you've got two kingdoms you can't have two kingdoms in god's kingdom that's why they had a problem judah was always fighting israel israel fighting judah they were brothers same way with us get it back together let's sing a song 403. y'all pray for us i've been to the water and i've been baptized i've been washed in the blood of the lamb i've been changed from the creature that i once was and redeemed and it's now my name i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has your life been rearranged ask yourself [Music] but today i am free i was lost in the darkness but now i'm found i was blind but now i see have you been changed i've been [Music] been changed all my life see what i'm talking about your life is being rearranged you don't have the same friends that you had before [Music] you don't talk like you used to everything's been rearranged in his presence i stand up he will wipe every tear from my eyes and i'll thank him for giving come on people wrecks like me a new home beyond the sky saying it to him i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed amen that's why that the change your body change started at your new birth many blessings it started at your new birth and it's just going to keep moving and keep moving out and keep moving out and keep moving out listen he rearranged your life when you got born again but he's also wanting to rearrange your spirit realm give you a new thought give you a new purpose i want everybody in this church to think about it this week what is my purpose what is my purpose for doing this what's my purpose for being here lord and you ask the lord just talk to him like he's like he's your friend he's supposed to be if it's hard to talk to god you need to be born again amen but just ask him said lord i don't i may be i may be over here in ephraim's field but i need to be over here in manassas because this is where i need to be like i said everybody a lot of people want to be this and want to be that it's what god wants you to be we've seen people that god rearranged their life so much to you look at them and go man only god could do that you know there's some people that that you meet in life and you know one thing's for sure they need god but when they get god you go man how'd that happen well your thought was how well you know how it could happen because you're praying for it lord change these people but let's start with lord change me change me first change me either so that i can be a conduit [Music] i want to be so yielded to god that he just speaks through me and not me myself want to do the speaking amen that's when we get something from the lord when we come here to this church expecting to not hear your favorite song or your favorite preacher or your favorite this but hear from god in worship you know we we're going to do that um we're going to dedicate the church up there and if they're watching in close your ears but we're going to dedicate that building up there but the people the one that needs to be dedicated because you take solomon there in the kings he built this great beautiful like we were talking about this great big temple that stood for hundreds of years never had a hammer never had a saw everything just fit romney just boom boom boom what would it be josiah if you had if you walked in tomorrow and every board was already cut every everything was already put right there and all you did is put it together like a like a lego or lincoln logs it don't happen that way we know that right because we have some saws and all these different things but when god anointed that temple he so anointed that temple nobody could talk [Music] the anointing of god fell so much in that building so the bible says the priest had to be quiet there was nothing said when the shekinah glory come down and then if you'll read solomon got down on his knees and he prayed a prayer read it in the bible he wanted that place so dedicated to the lord his daddy had desired it his daddy had looked for it but god promised that it would be through the son the son of man folks the son of man is what's building this temple right not saying it's not the son of god but i'm talking about the son of man it's what's building this temple it's me and you because that temple is transferred from wood to flesh and that's what god wants he does not want a holy building he wants a holy people that walk into that building and bring god with you sunday it was just so wonderful for those of you that weren't here you missed a hallelujah time god came down in that building and we we sang we didn't just sing we sang and god delivered people i'll that's what one time in my life i went and preached for brother joe i mean wasn't joe green at the time it was brother dan daisley and that service was so powerful you only get it a few times daddy will tell you i ever sermon ain't just every sermon is not a cloud and a and a harp and a and a horn right aaron okay i thought i might be the only one okay but uh i literally had my hand on the doorknob i wanted to get out there i didn't want to stay stuck in that room they were shouting and praising the lord so much till the pull was pulling me toward that door and i'd reach and get the door and i'd say no i'm not going to go out there because it came out right on the pulpit it was like the door right there it came around the pulpit and i didn't want to disturb that and it went off for minutes and minutes and minutes and minutes and when i walked out there it's just like water rushing through the building spoke so free till they still remember the sermon i preached on match and pieces like what brother dale preached in the 1990s 1995. what match here he's got to match and player up there and when it matches we're going home and they still remember that brother mike um orders the big tall singer every time i see him he says i still remember that sermon you preach and that was probably about 2001 or 2002 but not saying anything from me but all of us if we'll let that let that flow let that thing you know say well i don't know if i want let her go there we go we have to get a bigger building we'll do something let her go push the walls out amen if it's for god i want it if it's for people i don't care anything about it but it's for god then we should do it it shouldn't be one service ever just in your lifetime it should be a time when the minister wants to come out that door not worried what's going to happen when he does open the door right bob that's right we want wanna we want that door open and we want just the freeness of god to come in and to all of us sunday school class everything everything we do when we come in here we ought to have a new attitude let's jack it up a notch let's go a little bit higher if you want to stomp around and play the tambourine get that tambourine out there's one right here brother joel it needs some use exercise your gift listen that's what placing is folks you get in your place and you know when you get in your place it's not you worshiping it's god worshiping through you to minister to somebody else well i can't preach brother well yeah you can where you're at brother brown said what live me a sermon so that's for you sisters too live a sermon let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for being with us tonight lord i pray that you'll just be with each one or as they go on the highways home that you would keep them safe lord and bring them back together on sunday be with brother bob brother ryan be with us as we head to ohio that everything will be okay they're at um at the airport and and up there lord the weather will be fine and we'll be able to get back home lord we pray for the home church here that everything will be fine here father and we pray that you just have your hand on everything that we do forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make lord we are we're a blessed group of people and lord we're so blessed to be able to ask our father anything in his name and he'd give it to us so lord in the name of the lord jesus christ whatever you need tonight you just lift your hand and say god it's mine lord it's my possession and i take it in the name of the lord jesus christ because satan hates that name that's why i don't want people to be baptized in that name it's because he hates your name lord because there's power behind that name all heaven and earth is named jesus and lord the prophet of god told us whatever scripture speaks of the bridegroom also speaks of the bride so we're a part of that too lord thank you for the day that you give us be with us lord take care of us until we come back together and you in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed god bless did you give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are you
