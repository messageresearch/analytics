[4:15] either I'll test now saying to their
[4:18] brother brother let me pull out the mote
[4:21] that is in the eye when the silk behold

[5:26] o son about from the beginning there was
[5:28] he's been trying to separate us or
[5:31] killer or killers
[5:32] so best corner of regulations 1279
[5:46] chapter 12 seven verse tonight and there
[5:52] was war heaven Michael and his angels
[5:54] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[5:56] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[5:59] neither was their place found any more
[6:01] in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast
[6:04] out that old serpent called the devil
[6:06] and Satan which to see the whole wall he
[6:10] was cast out into the earth and his
[6:12] angels were cast out with him so what is
[6:16] he known here so we know there's no way
[6:22] we know there's only two sides the devil
[6:24] side and Ja side so like Joshua said
[6:28] choose your dated state who you shall
[6:30] serve as for me in my house I shall
[6:32] serve the Lord this might be a little
[6:36] off but I'm sorry the devil the devil's
[6:40] getting closer to home yeah pretty for
[6:43] all the people that they had that
[6:44] shooting in Texas today at the church is
[6:48] 26 people got killed
[6:50] I think of sportiness kids and the
[6:53] youngest was 17 months there was old
[6:57] there was one lady that was pregnant so
[7:04] so what are the unbelievers started
[7:06] doing they started mocking the people
[7:07] was when the guy was going on Alex
[7:10] showed everybody they were all praying
[7:12] and democracy very very pretty
[7:17] where's your God now
[7:25] we do that at the same thing to Jesus
[7:28] let's go to mark 15 27 to 32
[7:48] Mar 15 2015 2 and with him they are
[8:01] cursed by two thieves the one on the
[8:04] right hand and the other on the left
[8:05] hand and the scripture was fulfilled
[8:08] which saved and he was a number of it as
[8:12] transgressors and they they passed by
[8:14] rail on him why I think there he is
[8:16] insane though they destroyed the temple
[8:20] and buildest it in three days save
[8:22] thyself and come down from the cross
[8:24] love also the chief priests not said
[8:28] among themselves with a scribe he saved
[8:31] others himself he cannot say that Christ
[8:35] the King of Israel is sending up from
[8:37] the cross that we may see and believe in
[8:39] me and they they were crucified with him
[8:43] reviled
[9:04] we all have to learn to forgive each
[9:08] other unforgiveness unforgiveness is
[9:10] like the balloon if we try to suppress
[9:12] it in one area you'll pop out in another
[9:16] area of our life at time they start with
[9:21] obvious when someone is harboring
[9:23] unforgiveness mentioned the offender's
[9:25] name and all sorts of negative emotion
[9:28] bubble to the surface but other time and
[9:31] I'm forgiving spirit may not be so
[9:33] apparent because it's been repressed or
[9:36] deny it personally I wonder why he feels
[9:40] critical is distrustful with others
[9:43] realizing these emotions or symptoms of
[9:46] something deeper unforgiveness is like
[9:49] the balloon it would try to suppress it
[9:51] in a one area of our life it will pop up
[9:53] and another one this is no way to live
[9:56] there's certainly not the way the
[9:59] certain not for God intended for us
[10:01] according to Ephesians 4:30 we do to put
[10:06] away all bitterness wrath anger clamor
[10:08] slander malice each of which is evidence
[10:12] I'm forgiving spirit and he brews
[10:15] 1215 we were warned not to let ruin a
[10:20] bitterness spring up costing and upon
[10:22] those around us
[10:31] [Applause]
[10:37] we know God made the mountains the
[10:40] valleys the ocean so we're all different
[10:44] some people get offended real easier if
[10:47] somebody don't shake their hand or you
[10:50] know say hi or what others but but
[10:52] others other people's nothing bothers
[10:54] them you know we got one guy you told me
[11:05] to do something and he kind of rolls it
[11:07] and another the other guy you you talk
[11:10] do something just goes like that and
[11:12] then he says he'll throw his head in the
[11:14] ground said I ain't doing it so we're
[11:17] all different so just think God had made
[11:25] just one person the Venus horrible for
[11:29] example I'm not picking on him it was
[11:32] all brother ways this whole earth was
[11:33] cold by the way Vietnam place it would
[11:37] be a perfect world or a big world but if
[11:39] your neighborhoods ourselves you would
[11:44] get your mail and I hate myself you get
[11:46] your alive Abelson if you get your
[11:51] mail on time because maybe we'll get

[13:00] forgive not every one his brother their
[13:02] transgressors
[13:05] maybe I'll just mark them off
[13:20] and the message pursue member Lim said
[13:23] he said here not long ago they got some
[13:26] issues each one pull up to himself as
[13:29] the little issues presuming that's what
[13:32] they ought to have done that's what they
[13:35] ought not to have done stick together
[13:38] all of you don't take your issues out
[13:40] like that bring it in here and pray it
[13:42] out if you can't have your issues and
[13:45] still love your brother all right but
[13:47] when you lose respect and fellowship
[13:49] with your whether your issue is killed
[13:52] kill you
[14:12] we'll say at 14 for our lilting
[14:15] backsliding I will love them free for my
[14:18] anger strength away from him Matthew
[14:23] 5:43 48 you revert it has said thou
[14:27] shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine
[14:29] enemy but I say unto you love your
[14:31] enemies bless them that curse you do
[14:33] good to them that hate you and pray for
[14:36] them which despitefully use you and
[14:39] persecute you that you may be the
[14:42] children are your father which is in
[14:44] heaven the hope or he made the Sun to
[14:47] rise on the evil and on the good and
[14:49] sendeth rain on the just and on the
[14:51] unjust but if you love that we love you
[14:54] what reward have ye but the money and
[14:57] that poker counts the same if you salute
[15:00] your brother only what do you more than
[15:02] others do not even the publicans so be
[15:07] therefore perfect even as your father
[15:09] which is in heaven is perfect
[15:13] matthew limits 61920 for said lay not
[15:18] your treasures at the pond earth and
[15:21] when it where moth and rust do corrupt
[15:23] and where thieves break through and
[15:26] steal but lay up yourself treasures in
[15:29] heaven which neither no moth nor rust do
[15:31] corrupt Bertie's the membrane through
[15:34] nor steal for where your treasure is
[15:37] there will your heart be also the light
[15:40] of the body is the eye
[15:42] therefore the eye be single thy whole
[15:45] body shall be full of light better than
[15:48] I the evil their whole body shall be
[15:50] full of darkness if therefore the light
[15:53] is in thee be darkness not great
[15:56] instrument darkness no man could say to
[16:03] vessels where he will hate the one and
[16:05] love the other also he will hold to the
[16:08] one and despise the other you cannot
[16:12] serve to serve God and Mammon
[16:15] that's benefited my family Matthew 22:30
[16:23] 5:37 man one of them which is Lord ask
[16:26] him a question tempting him the same
[16:28] master which is the Great Commandment in
[16:31] the law Jesus stayed on behind not shalt
[16:33] love thy Lord thy God with all thy heart
[16:35] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[16:38] mind this is the first and Great
[16:41] Commandment and the second is like time
[16:43] to unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor
[16:46] as ourself
[16:47] by the way that's right
[16:54] matthew 24:6 13 and you have heard of
[16:58] wars and rumors of wars either you be
[17:00] not troubled for all these things must
[17:02] come to pass but the end is not yet
[17:05] for nation shall rise against nation and
[17:08] Kingdom against Kingdom to eventually
[17:10] famine and pestilence earthquakes in
[17:12] diverse places all these are beginnings
[17:15] of Sorrows driven and I shall deliver
[17:18] you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[17:21] you shall be hated of all nations for my
[17:23] name's sake and then shall many be
[17:29] offended and shall betray one another
[17:31] and shall hate one another the many
[17:33] false prophets shall rise and shall
[17:35] deceive many
[17:36] and because iniquity shall abound the
[17:39] love of Managed west cold but neither
[17:42] shall endure to the end the same shall
[17:46] be saved
[17:55] John 13:34 a new commandment I give unto
[17:59] you that you go one of us and notice I
[18:02] had loved you that ye also love one
[18:03] another that's quite a few on that whole
[18:11] Bible still below normal Romans 13:8
[18:17] over no man anything but to love one
[18:20] another where he that of it another that
[18:23] fulfilled the law 1st Thessalonians 4 9
[18:28] but it's touching brotherly love you
[18:30] need not get it right unto you for you
[18:33] yourselves have thought of God to love
[18:35] one another
[18:36] first Peter 1:22 seen you yet purify
[18:40] your souls in obeying the truth through
[18:42] the spirit I'm dead I'm forgiven love
[18:45] the Brethren see that you love one
[18:48] another with a pure heart fervently let
[18:54] everybody feel it here first John 3:23
[18:58] and this is it this commandment that we
[19:00] should believe on the name of his son
[19:02] Jesus Christ and love one another as he
[19:05] gave us commandment first John four
[19:11] eleven twelve we fell because so loved
[19:16] us we ought to look also love one
[19:18] another no man has seen God at any time
[19:21] we felt one another God dwell in US and
[19:24] his love is perfect in this
[19:27] [Music]
[19:31] second job Johnson and now I beseech you
[19:38] lady not as that though I wrote a new
[19:40] commandment unto thee but that wish we
[19:43] had from the game that we love one
[19:44] another in the message protocol
[19:50] both of em said I can see him again with
[19:53] the big crowds down there as long as
[19:55] money lasted he was a good fellow that's
[19:58] the way the world treats you as long as
[20:00] you've got money got friends but when
[20:02] your money's gone your friends along
[20:04] that's right whether friends an old
[20:07] friend will stick by if you haven't got
[20:10] haven't got a penny Jesus Christ the Son
[20:13] of God I've been to a place where I had
[20:17] another cent he loved me he loved me
[20:19] just as much as that would have a penny
[20:21] or if I had a million dollars he loves
[20:25] me just the same that pure holy
[20:27] unadulterated love comes
[20:29] I'm going along down from his people
[20:31] that's the way we should love one
[20:33] another with God the message the works
[20:41] that I do bear witness of me after all I
[20:45] read all had the love of God steel in my
[20:46] heart and all the gifts there is in the
[20:48] Bible that's right I thought of that
[20:51] here human nice ago my little girl
[20:53] called me and told her she wanted me to
[20:55] come home to her she does me oh my so I
[20:59] said told her I sent her a new dog but
[21:03] she didn't want at all she said I want
[21:06] you daddy not your dome she wants me
[21:08] well that's the way I think about Jesus
[21:11] I love his gifts and things to help its
[21:13] people but I want Jesus the love of God
[21:15] sealed in your heart press the head
[21:17] until all the water the world's press
[21:20] down and you see nothing but the Lord to
[21:23] love him as you love one another you
[21:25] love the Lord if you don't know how to
[21:27] know that you can love the Lord he says
[21:30] so that's right and God can't move into
[21:33] it the works that I do bear witness I
[21:37] mean
[21:38] and remember the children I don't care
[21:40] what church you don't talk or what you
[21:42] have done
[21:43] oh well you've done this or that or they
[21:46] are there how much you put it in the
[21:48] collection place or if you're a deacon
[21:50] preacher or pastor or be a lay member or
[21:54] whatever it is you'll never come into
[21:56] the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit
[21:59] has Sealy and then to the kingdom but
[22:01] His divine love that the whole Christian
[22:04] world is your brother and sister that's
[22:06] right the world sealed up and God's
[22:09] sealed in well you'd ever want to know
[22:11] that truly with divine Christin little
[22:14] that's right then you know the Holy
[22:15] Spirit is really working through you
[22:18] then that's right and by their fruits
[22:20] you shall know them
[22:25] faith is a substance so Paul said it was
[22:29] impossible for him to do those things
[22:31] without having the giver though I speak
[22:34] with tongues of men and angels they're
[22:36] not charity it prefer to mean nothing
[22:38] Rosi all right no know one another about
[22:43] everything that you do that one another
[22:45] as you know wanna know you love glossy
[22:48] you love each other and you love God or
[22:51] God is love
[22:52] man they watches him love walks in life
[22:55] and perfect love casts out all fear many
[22:58] you can't take him at his world and not
[23:02] feel terrible about it
[23:03] say lord I love you I know you're going
[23:06] to answer because you promised me you
[23:08] would I just know you're going to do is
[23:11] see and it takes away all fear you
[23:15] describe the same yesterday every room
[23:17] and one is is an attribute of
[23:19] God and if we be just children and God
[23:22] wants us to love one another in doing so
[23:25] without God is that right we love his
[23:28] church not the building that people
[23:31] right Jesus quite the same yesterday
[23:37] forever the same message I wasn't on
[23:39] this and I found this in my life my
[23:41] ministry if you you want to serve God
[23:43] serve his people that's how you serve as
[23:46] we love one another without God I love
[23:49] its people I'm doing all that I know not
[23:51] to try to really percent our Lord Jesus
[23:54] Christ and no wait that means divine
[23:56] mercy and power that he has given me to
[24:00] the church in his last day in the
[24:07] healing line listen here's a lovely
[24:11] thing is you're sure one and all you're
[24:13] serving God see the love of God is in
[24:15] every Christian heart and be kind to one
[24:18] another forgiving one another if you
[24:20] don't see the scripture just a life well
[24:23] you believe any home and pray for the
[24:26] other person and just that one you'll
[24:28] find there's no greater evidence a
[24:31] Christian in the world and love
[24:34] expectations and when we love God with
[24:37] all our hearts Souls and minds and we
[24:39] love one another as ourselves our
[24:42] neighbors as ourselves the people and
[24:45] actually feel that you can't put it out
[24:48] you can't make it believe because
[24:50] they'll know it
[24:51] I believe Lincoln said one time you can
[24:54] pull a part of the people for the time
[24:57] but not all of the people all of the
[25:00] time and that's right
[25:01] if you got love in your heart for the
[25:03] people of Illinois you might act
[25:05] different different or anything but
[25:07] still they know they can't feel it it's
[25:11] another dimension
[25:12] as we call it better injects to these
[25:16] people love they know it and they
[25:18] believe it and that's when you can help
[25:20] the person when you
[25:21] believe it and retention my power that's
[25:28] a good thing about all time religion
[25:31] it makes everybody said together and
[25:33] love one another
[25:34] sure does takes all the differences away
[25:37] makes new creatures you'll make that
[25:39] succeed your coat and a pair of overalls
[25:42] but your arms are on one another say
[25:45] brother you getting along that's right
[25:48] sure you'll make a silk dress and call
[25:52] it cold what's a colleague account
[25:54] fundamental material
[25:56] I know glad you don't have open their
[26:11] arms and say sister Lydia that's what it
[26:14] does it sure does
[26:15] just tear down the differences rich or
[26:18] poor barn or food we're all one in
[26:21] Christ Jesus
[26:24] the position I believe in Christ
[26:27] forget your tradition let's come
[26:29] together as God's children and you can't
[26:32] know one another like that then there's
[26:35] something wrong with your experiences I
[26:37] want to save upon emotion and you wonder
[26:41] why all this false false teachings are
[26:44] rising up in these churches people in
[26:46] person anything is the very cause of a
[26:49] the church is hunger and food but you
[26:51] can't get together get yourself together
[26:53] in Christ Jesus and God will give you
[26:56] that real genuine faith in Tison spirits
[27:03] it's just like God heard the car works
[27:06] where they build a big bunch of freight
[27:07] car or a big bunch of passengers car you
[27:11] said I used to work there an egg take it
[27:12] and build a little big coaches and
[27:14] everything and put fargood in and laid
[27:17] mahogany hard on it
[27:19] so beautiful set it out there on a track
[27:22] it was then it was dead as a doornail
[27:26] there are said to hinge and no steam
[27:28] minute you just said that what it is
[27:31] today is some fire in a boiler when this
[27:33] today is some steam when is today in the
[27:36] church - Paul - the hottest point thing
[27:39] there is two balls the sin out of your
[27:42] life
[27:42] don't forgiveness it's part of sin
[27:46] develop out and you can't love one
[27:50] another how are you going to love God
[27:52] well you haven't seen without hides a
[27:55] multitude of sin getting a little with
[27:57] God and you love one another then you
[27:59] love the church you love the college you
[28:01] everything that's godly and you keep
[28:03] away from the things of the world where
[28:07] I think pentecost failed he would
[28:10] disagree a million miles upon theology
[28:12] if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my
[28:14] brother
[28:15] and it's my sister and we've drawn those
[28:18] nine we can't love your brother we have
[28:20] seen how can you love God we can't have
[28:25] never seen Embree little money that goes
[28:28] out got gold when love goes out you got
[28:31] close with it well god is love and you
[28:34] can't never get anywhere with it without
[28:38] divine love as much as you've got one
[28:41] another you
[28:46] I've got about a million laughs ready
[28:52] fellowship with God but this great
[28:55] strain of man longing for fellowship we
[28:57] try to bring people together through
[28:59] their ages many times the educational
[29:02] programs has tried to unite people
[29:03] together by education and standing in
[29:06] this auditorium tonight this leverage
[29:09] school certainly won't speak against
[29:12] education but education is not the
[29:14] appropriate way for fellowship you can't
[29:17] educate people to love one another you
[29:19] think you can but it takes that divine
[29:21] order to do that there's no way to do it
[29:24] through education the church and its
[29:31] condition you can't love nothing that
[29:35] wasn't of your nature love it has to
[29:38] unite with love and husband and wife has
[29:41] to love one another if they ever made
[29:44] the grade family has to love one another
[29:47] you've ever make the great something to
[29:51] be loved you search everywhere find a
[29:53] girl to be your wife that you know your
[29:55] searches planning a husband that you
[29:57] could love you got searches trying to
[30:01] find a soul that he can love so he
[30:03] representing himself there on earth as
[30:05] in gentle dove and a gentle man if that
[30:08] land would want in one minute ever taken
[30:11] on nature snarling wolf the dead dove
[30:14] would took flight immediately ship that
[30:17] gun oh wait
[30:19] a lot of time we filled down or if
[30:22] somebody don't love me or somebody hurt
[30:24] my medicine I'm not beside God it's
[30:28] hugging your your kids or your
[30:30] grandbabies I'm ready to tackle the
[30:32] world from the beginning it wasn't so if
[30:41] your church tradition has taught you
[30:43] contrary to that let's go back to the
[30:45] beginning of where we left it
[30:46] and let's produce here tonight a members
[30:50] of the church at the beginning who had
[30:52] brotherly love one for another they down
[30:54] their lives for one another men and
[30:57] women would love one another such divine
[30:59] love till they go any degree or two the
[31:05] yellow sweet penitentiary get or to the
[31:08] Gulf each other
[31:09] that's the original church the Lord
[31:11] bless you while we pray conference with
[31:15] God
[31:16] so you see beyond an ending controversy
[31:19] God has seen his people and we ought to
[31:22] respect one another we are to love one
[31:25] another be honored Dominus my name is
[31:27] Barry we ought to love one another
[31:29] anyhow no matter we can't agree maybe

[31:37] greatest and many things John Moore

[32:10] so our heart goes to them analyse your
[32:17] churches I never won an interest or
[32:20] indifferent don't weekly trauma disagree
[32:22] if we will spend at a table one date and
[32:26] one kind of pie one another it would be
[32:28] just as much as right here see when it
[32:31] comes to felsham I know that we love one
[32:33] another though we don't do that then
[32:35] wish you we should do that and it will
[32:37] never go no further than God until we do

[32:48] angels and my body to be burned as a
[32:51] sacrifice understand all knowledge and
[32:54] so forth nothing so but when that which
[32:58] is perfect which is that if all of this
[33:01] pure gift this mortal together with love

[36:57] Rebbe talks about the Romanian when he
[37:01] was in the Portland Oregon
[37:02] he said he stood in August his spit in
[37:10] my face he said your snake in the grass
[37:12] I'll show you how my servant of God you
[37:14] are you deceiver
[37:15] I never said one word I just looked at
[37:18] him and all at once
[37:19] the Holy Spirit something that another
[37:23] what would you think of a man spit in
[37:25] your face why there's any temper about
[37:28] you it was right it sure it would here
[37:30] come two cups of the same two cups that
[37:34] good things and there has to beat the
[37:37] man not to take him off but I couldn't
[37:40] let them do it God had brought love in
[37:43] my heart for that moral being I thought
[37:45] it's not the man it's the devil's got
[37:47] him in that condition that man would be
[37:51] a normal man who wants to live who wants
[37:55] to learn to live like all the mentalism
[37:57] but it's the devil it's got him live in
[38:00] and love again to throw art for that man
[38:03] and the first thing you know that man
[38:05] drop that fell across my feet there said
[38:08] when divine love had projected suffering
[38:11] grace stepped in and took his place
[38:12] he'll do it every time what's that mean
[38:35] you know heels talked about the Hornets

[39:18] around now there's something to get this
[39:20] on but the Jew at home but God I haven't
[39:23] noticed whether it's true or not
[39:25] then instead of trying to fight and beat
[39:27] and smack them morning there was some
[39:30] kind of godly love coming over me and I
