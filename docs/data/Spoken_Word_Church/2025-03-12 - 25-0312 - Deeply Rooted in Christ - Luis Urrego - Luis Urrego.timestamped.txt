[0:53] God praise the Lord Jesus what a
[0:56] wonderful thing it is to know that we

[1:46] people's life you know you know some
[1:48] people have gotten wealthy through a
[1:50] book when they applied principles you

[3:26] amen well let's go to um Matthew chapter
[3:29] 13 this
[3:31] evening amen I just want to take a
[3:33] little simple thought this evening and
[3:35] just speak about deeply rooted in Christ
[3:39] amen deeply rooted in Christ in Matthew
[3:43] Chapter
[3:45] 13 Verse three and it says and he spake
[3:50] many things unto them in Parables saying
[3:53] Behold a swer went forth to sow and when
[3:57] he sowed some seeds fell by their way
[4:02] Wayside and the fowls came and devoured
[4:04] them up some fell upon Stony places
[4:08] where they had not much
[4:10] Earth and forwith they sprung up because
[4:13] they had no deepness of Earth and when
[4:16] the sun was up they were scorched and
[4:18] because they had no root they withered
[4:21] away all right now let's go to verse
[4:23] verse 20 of the same chapter it says but
[4:27] he that received the seed in into Stony
[4:30] places the same as he that heareth the
[4:33] word and the none with joy receiveth it
[4:37] yet hath he not root in himself but dth
[4:42] for a while for when tribulation or
[4:44] persecution
[4:46] ariseth because of the word by and by He
[4:50] Is offended amen praise the Lord you may
[4:54] have your seats this evening praise God
[5:01] amen amen uh I just we we've been
[5:04] mentioning here uh in the last several
[5:07] Services uh a lot regarding uh uh you
[5:11] know us being the branches and we and
[5:13] him being the the vine and uh and I'm
[5:17] speaking a little slow so that way
[5:19] brother Manuel can can keep up he's back
[5:21] there interpreting because I understand
[5:24] [Laughter]
[5:26] him so um
[5:30] but um how important it is to to know
[5:34] amen that you are not just amen part of
[5:38] of the tree of life amen but that you
[5:40] are connected to the tree of life amen
[5:43] and you were connected by a new birth
[5:46] amen praise the Lord Jesus now I was um
[5:50] I was in my uh I was visiting my parents
[5:52] last weekend and um my dad and me we
[5:55] went for a walk it's a rare rare thing
[5:58] we we do he walks all the time
[6:00] he's 75 years old almost and he just
[6:03] thank God the Lord's really kept him he
[6:06] he he moves and and just handles himself
[6:10] like a 45y
[6:12] old but uh and then that's just the
[6:14] grace of God he all he just gives the
[6:16] thanks to the Lord for that but he walks
[6:18] every day just about and um but he and
[6:23] me we got we got to walk in and behind
[6:24] this house their house there's a there's
[6:27] some trails and uh and I had not been
[6:30] there probably in about a year this was
[6:32] the last time I was walking back there
[6:34] and as I was walking through those
[6:36] Trails which I have walked through
[6:38] before I was noticing that there was a
[6:41] lot of down
[6:42] trees and it was because of the last two
[6:45] storms that came through you know they
[6:46] were really strong you know the
[6:48] hurricane back in September and then
[6:50] they also had a very strong storm just
[6:52] right before that hurricane came through
[6:55] and uh there were some huge huge trees
[6:58] that I I had been there before never
[7:02] thought that those trees would go down
[7:05] and they were tumbled over they were
[7:08] tumbled over and um you know and I and I
[7:11] thought Within Myself you know uh you
[7:14] know sometimes we think you know that
[7:18] things may not
[7:20] happen and and then they they
[7:23] happen and they happen because you see
[7:27] you're not in control of all things
[7:29] things amen praise God but he's
[7:32] ultimately the one who has to say so in
[7:34] all things amen praise the Lord so and I
[7:38] was just thinking you know that these
[7:40] trees why are they down well I mean they
[7:42] were just as thick as all as some of the
[7:45] other trees that were still
[7:47] up uh they seemed like they had full my
[7:50] dad says yeah that one tree over there
[7:52] it had I it was it was beautiful it it
[7:55] it grow leaves beautifully and
[7:58] everything it seemed like he didn't
[7:59] think it would ever go down but it went
[8:02] down it was all and it was it's
[8:04] withering now you know because it's been
[8:06] several months now so I was just
[8:09] thinking you know those trees just could
[8:11] not withstand the
[8:13] element the elements around them were
[8:16] too strong for the foundation that they
[8:20] had you see and so it depends on the
[8:24] foundation that you have amen whether
[8:27] you're going to withstand the elements
[8:30] around you or not amen because let me
[8:33] tell you the bigger they are the harder
[8:35] they
[8:37] fall the bigger you might think somebody
[8:40] is in in in spiritually oh that Pastor
[8:43] just could never leave the message The
[8:45] Harder They
[8:47] Fall you see and that's just how it is
[8:50] amen and and and and it's because these
[8:53] trees did not have Deep Roots amen how
[8:58] come the other ones didn't fall I would
[9:01] they they were experiencing the same
[9:03] winds the same storm the same rain yet
[9:07] they still stayed up oh they might have
[9:09] been shaking a little bit here and there
[9:11] maybe some bark fell off maybe some some
[9:14] some some leaves fell off maybe a couple
[9:16] of branches came down but the tree
[9:18] within itself stayed up amen amen and
[9:21] then and and and so I want you to think
[9:24] of in your life amen uh uh what it what
[9:28] is it going to it I the devil's waiting
[9:31] for something to happen amen that'll
[9:32] cause you to just go ahead and just give
[9:34] it all up oh he's waiting he's always
[9:37] accusing you he's always accusing us
[9:40] before the father and saying how you did
[9:43] this how you did that yesterday and look
[9:45] what happened this day amen but I'm so
[9:47] thankful amen that if you're you're
[9:49] connected to that vine amen you're
[9:52] connected to the root and if your roots
[9:54] are grounded and they're deep amen there
[9:56] is nothing that can happen amen that
[9:58] will cause you to fall amen amen praise
[10:00] the Lord Jesus
[10:01] amen and and and and as I was there just
[10:04] walking through and all you could see
[10:06] left was just the memory of what
[10:09] was and and and and the how the root
[10:12] system that it did have it was it was
[10:15] you know tumbled over you know and um
[10:19] and it all you all you see is the memory
[10:21] there amen of something that that was
[10:23] great and it probably could have lasted
[10:26] a long a long time right but it didn't
[10:29] and so you're looking at you're looking
[10:31] at life and you're looking at Christian
[10:33] lives and and you think my that could
[10:35] that could have been something great he
[10:37] could have helped she could have helped
[10:38] a lot of people amen amen that testimony
[10:42] amen was just spotless until something
[10:46] just came through you know brother
[10:47] random preaches that message and says uh
[10:50] until that time I believe is what it was
[10:53] and uh until that time amen and that
[10:56] changed that changed things completely
[10:58] amen praise the Lord l so we we look
[11:01] here in in in this scripture in Matthew
[11:03] Chapter 13 and and Jesus is speaking
[11:06] it's a very familiar scripture to us and
[11:09] uh I'll do my best to not keep you all
[11:11] too long this evening but uh we're
[11:12] looking here at the parable of the SE
[11:14] and and uh Jesus Jesus mentions um in
[11:19] verse six he says and when the sun was
[11:21] up they they were scorched these seeds
[11:24] that that were that fell on Stony places
[11:27] where they had not much Earth and for
[11:29] with they sprung up because they had no
[11:31] deepness of Earth amen so they they they
[11:35] they started they they they started uh
[11:38] growing right what was in them started
[11:41] growing amen but because they had no
[11:44] where and no way to get to down to the
[11:46] soil there was no roots that they could
[11:49] attach into the soil so they could
[11:50] continue growing you see and Jesus says
[11:53] here in verse 6 and when the sun was up
[11:55] they were scorched because they had no
[11:57] root they withered away way notice that
[12:00] the elements on the outside was what
[12:02] destroyed the seed amen and it wasn't
[12:05] anything it was it had what it needed
[12:09] the seed was good because it it it made
[12:12] it was starting to grow but you see it
[12:14] did not take a it did not go into the
[12:17] soil and it allowed for the elements on
[12:19] the outside which was the sun to wither
[12:22] it and to make it dry now the sun is
[12:24] actually supposed to help it
[12:26] grow but it needs to be be connected
[12:30] with the soil amen amen and we'll speak
[12:32] about that soil here in just a moment
[12:35] amen and then in verse 21 uh verse 20 he
[12:39] he says but he that receiveth the seed
[12:41] into Stony places the same as he that
[12:43] heareth the word and a none with joy
[12:45] receives it yet hath he not root in
[12:49] himself amen how many people have you
[12:52] have have you known amen that they
[12:54] they're excited and they've received the
[12:56] word with excitement amen we've seen
[12:59] many come through and they got excited
[13:01] about the message and they get excited
[13:03] about the word but there is no root in
[13:06] there to Anchor them to hold them amen
[13:09] when hard times come when difficult
[13:12] times when things are pressing in
[13:14] sickness might come through amen a
[13:17] family member who doesn't want to come
[13:18] to church may be influencing them and
[13:21] then they eventually they just slip away
[13:24] amen but they were excited it seemed
[13:26] like they they got something you can't
[13:29] say that they did not get anything they
[13:31] got something but it wasn't enough to
[13:33] Anchor or Holden Amen in this word
[13:36] praise the Lord amen so here Jesus he's
[13:40] explaining about the the importance amen
[13:42] of being uh rooted in your faith amen
[13:45] praise God because the seeds that fall
[13:47] on these Rocky grounds amen they
[13:50] withered amen because the lack of of of
[13:53] of Deep Roots amen and so we need to
[13:55] have deep roots in our in our spiritual
[13:58] walk amen
[13:59] not just shallow roots amen but deep
[14:02] roots because you can make it through a
[14:04] little storm amen here and there you can
[14:06] make it through some storms amen but the
[14:09] Ultimate Storm will come that God knows
[14:11] amen that it it will come and and storms
[14:15] will come Temptations will come amen
[14:17] trials and tribulations will come amen
[14:20] and you must be you must be rooted deep
[14:23] Amen in order for you to stand Amen in
[14:25] the in this last day that we're living
[14:27] in cuz we're living in such perilous
[14:29] time Saints
[14:31] amen and we see that Jesus here he he
[14:34] also repeats the same uh Parable in Luke
[14:36] chapter8 verse 5 and six now I want you
[14:40] to look at something here real quick he
[14:41] says he if you want to go with me there
[14:43] but it says in Luke 8: 5 and 6 a swer
[14:47] went out to sew his seed and as he sowed
[14:51] some fell by the wayside and it was
[14:54] trotten down and the fowls of the air
[14:57] devoured it
[14:59] and some fell upon a rock and as soon as
[15:02] it was sprung up so we notice that it
[15:05] sprung
[15:06] up it withered
[15:09] away and watch what Jesus says here
[15:11] because it lacked moisture all right so
[15:16] if in one place he says because it
[15:18] withered away because it didn't have
[15:20] root and now here he's saying because it
[15:23] lacked uh moisture it must mean that
[15:26] root and moisture have to do something
[15:28] to to to with each other amen and
[15:31] so a root what it does is it it it takes
[15:35] up it takes up water Amen in order for
[15:38] the for the tree to be able to live so
[15:40] the reason why this seed here amen it
[15:43] Not only was it not taking up water
[15:46] because it didn't have enough roots to
[15:48] grab to the water amen it didn't also of
[15:51] course it didn't that didn't that did
[15:53] not allow for those roots to continue
[15:55] growing you see praise God so so that
[15:59] that's very interesting Saints because
[16:00] water and Roots amen the more you are
[16:03] connected to Christ the more you are
[16:05] feeding on this water of life amen the
[16:07] more those roots are supposed to be
[16:09] expanded amen though in order for you to
[16:12] live amen that's the reason why we say
[16:15] Washed by the Water of the word amen as
[16:18] the word is going forth It's washing you
[16:20] amen it's giving you life amen and it's
[16:23] intertwining and connecting and it
[16:25] should connect you to one another right
[16:28] to good truth trees that have good roots
[16:31] praise God because a good a good trees
[16:34] amen a whole wood of trees or or Forest
[16:38] full of trees they're just they're not
[16:40] just an island to
[16:42] themselves if you see the world under
[16:45] them amen it's a to it's a connected
[16:48] world Amen it's a world Amen that the
[16:51] world out here does not see it looks
[16:54] like they're separated on the outside
[16:56] but on the inside amen there is a full
[16:58] connction ction and I believe in this
[17:00] hour saints that we're going to need one
[17:02] another more than you think that we need
[17:03] one another especially in the time that
[17:06] we're living in Saints you're going to
[17:08] need amen your brother and your
[17:10] sister oh you might not like me but
[17:14] you're going to need
[17:15] me amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm going
[17:19] to need you why because if you are part
[17:22] of Christ and I'm part of Christ we're
[17:24] part of the same Vine amen we're part of
[17:26] the same root system amen praise God and
[17:29] we going to need one another in this
[17:31] hour amen oh my praise the Lord Jesus I
[17:35] believe that even in the days amen when
[17:37] when when when when the martyrs amen
[17:39] during that time amen it was it was
[17:41] during the times amen when when
[17:43] persecution was coming in that they were
[17:45] drawing closer to one another they may
[17:48] have may may not have agreed on some
[17:50] doctrines they may not have agreed on
[17:52] this here in there and maybe personality
[17:55] uh you know kind of clashed with each
[17:57] other amen but when person persecution
[17:59] amen come in and they're all fighting
[18:01] for the same cause amen that should
[18:03] cause you to to draw closer together and
[18:07] those trees amen they are they are knit
[18:09] tight to one another amen and that's the
[18:11] reason that's another reason why they
[18:13] don't
[18:15] fall they they have a good root system
[18:19] they have good nourishment from the
[18:21] water and they're also interconnected
[18:23] with each other amen and just think
[18:25] about that in the spiritual life amen
[18:27] how important that is praise the Lord to
[18:30] be connected to one
[18:31] another because the long the longer we
[18:34] live Saints the more uh
[18:37] Society Society the way it is it it it
[18:42] it it's causing us Amen to just be
[18:48] loners I don't know how how better way
[18:51] to say
[18:52] that and uh you're you're going to need
[18:56] somebody amen at some point praise God
[18:59] Amen first of all you need Christ amen
[19:03] amen and second of all if you you need
[19:05] your brother you need one another praise
[19:06] the Lord Jesus now let's talk about the
[19:09] nature of a seed for just a moment amen
[19:12] now brother brother brandom he he
[19:14] mentioned uh in several times in the
[19:16] message he would talk about the
[19:18] deratization
[19:29] that that that term isn't really in the
[19:30] dictionary but it's it is germinated
[19:33] seed amen germinated seed and that is
[19:37] that is seed that already has life in it
[19:40] all right so uh brother Wade when he's
[19:43] getting ready to plant uh uh his uh corn
[19:46] or and his his his vegetables and things
[19:49] he plants seed that he knows has life in
[19:53] it right or in other words it's been
[19:56] germinated because you can plant a seed
[20:00] that looks just like a regular seed that
[20:03] has been germinated that has life and it
[20:06] looks exactly like it but if it doesn't
[20:10] have a that germ that germanized uh uh
[20:13] uh life in it amen you can put all kinds
[20:16] of fertilizer on top of it you can put
[20:18] the sun you can put a lot of water I
[20:21] mean tons of water on it and nothing
[20:23] will happen nothing will happen amen so
[20:27] this germatize seed or germinated seed
[20:31] what it means is that it has undergone
[20:34] pollination and that it's now an an
[20:36] embryo amen praise the Lord Jesus Oh My
[20:40] amen praise God and I I'm just thinking
[20:43] amen that in God's mind this word amen
[20:45] is
[20:48] deratization amen amen and when you hear
[20:51] this word praise the Lord amen something
[20:54] amen that that strikes that amen and it
[20:56] causes amen a germination of effect to
[20:59] take place in your life amen praise God
[21:02] Amen so uh and so that's the difference
[21:05] between what happens that is a germatize
[21:07] seed and then germination is what occurs
[21:11] when the seed breaks open and begins to
[21:14] grow and that's where that's when you
[21:16] start seeing the little shoot coming
[21:17] through amen praise the Lord
[21:20] now all that in order for it to come
[21:23] through but that means that that that
[21:25] life has already had to have been there
[21:28] amen and from the beginning you see
[21:30] praise the Lord amen and so that life
[21:33] amen was in the mind of God before the
[21:35] foundation of the world Amen praise God
[21:38] you were in him before the foundation of
[21:40] the world but you had to come here to
[21:42] hear the word amen and therefore that
[21:45] word strikes that seed which the seed
[21:48] you're not Eternal the seed is which is
[21:51] the word amen and then it can spring
[21:53] forth you
[21:55] see but there has never been any one
[21:58] that has received a new birth without
[22:00] first hearing the word of God you have
[22:03] to be around or hear the word of God
[22:05] read the word of God in order for there
[22:08] to truly be a a there a new birth amen
[22:12] so how important it the word of God is
[22:14] amen and as I was saying there at the
[22:15] beginning amen the word is the only
[22:18] thing that can produce life in someone's
[22:20] Soul amen amen tell me if The Da Vinci
[22:23] Code can do that amen or or or or any of
[22:27] these secular books that are are out
[22:28] there amen none of them can they can
[22:31] entertain you for a little while and
[22:33] they can make you laugh or make you cry
[22:35] or make you depressed amen but they can
[22:37] never change a soul amen not like this
[22:40] word can amen and I'm so thankful amen
[22:42] and this hour that we have that praise
[22:45] God brother brandham says in the message
[22:47] uh seeking after Jesus in 1953 he says
[22:50] this and this is just not something that
[22:53] some mythical something that somebody
[22:55] has thought up it's the word of God now
[22:59] all man can't receive
[23:02] it all man can't receive it they can
[23:05] hear
[23:06] it but not all men can receive it the
[23:09] Bible said that they'd be blind and
[23:11] they'd just they'd just have to be the
[23:13] Bible said that they were for ordained
[23:15] to this condemnation they just can't
[23:17] believe it they've got nothing in there
[23:20] to believe with so they just like a
[23:23] grain of corn if it isn't gerti here he
[23:27] says that word again ger ized in other
[23:29] words pre-ordained
[23:31] or with the life amen well a good
[23:34] pollinated seed amen it'll never raise
[23:38] up no matter how much fertilizer you put
[23:41] on it it has no life to raise by but if
[23:45] it's got life you can just put in any
[23:47] kind of ground and it'll come forth amen
[23:50] amen praise God now we'll talk about
[23:52] that here in just a moment when we get
[23:54] to uh here in just a moment I'm going to
[23:57] speak about predestination for just a
[23:59] moment amen so uh so just as a plant
[24:02] thrives in fertile soil amen Faith also
[24:07] thrives in a spiritually prepared heart
[24:10] amen praise God faith amen is Faith
[24:14] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[24:15] word of God so faith and hearing amen go
[24:18] go hand in hand praise the Lord and in
[24:21] order for that seed Amen to come amen
[24:24] into fruition or be or or or start
[24:26] germinating or start producing life you
[24:28] have to have faith in the word amen you
[24:32] have to have faith that what God Said
[24:34] Amen is for you praise the Lord Jesus
[24:37] you have to have faith amen that if the
[24:38] word says amen uh by your stripes he by
[24:42] your by his stripes you are healed amen
[24:44] you take that word for you amen and you
[24:47] are healed oh I don't feel anything amen
[24:50] but just take it by faith because the
[24:53] the word is already it's already gerz
[24:56] amen it's got life in it praise God
[24:58] and all it needs is to be embedded in
[25:00] the ground of Faith amen your faith and
[25:03] watch that and watch that word come to
[25:05] uh come to pass praise the Lord amen so
[25:08] the word the word can only take root in
[25:12] a faith prepared heart amen so we we
[25:15] know that Faith amen has to be there in
[25:18] order for the word to live in your life
[25:20] amen because let me just make it this
[25:23] way you're not going to follow anything
[25:24] that you don't believe
[25:27] right you're not going to uh follow uh
[25:30] or go after uh with your whole heart
[25:34] anything that that that really is not of
[25:37] importance to you amen so because you
[25:40] believe the word amen then the word can
[25:42] do something for you amen praise God now
[25:45] this seed amen it has to be planted in
[25:48] You by natural means now when I say
[25:50] natural means I mean like Romans 10:17
[25:54] says faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[25:57] by the word of God Amen and as I said
[26:00] earlier amen no one has ever received a
[26:02] new birth experience without the word
[26:05] there being first amen because the word
[26:08] is the only one that can give a new
[26:10] birth amen because it is life amen it is
[26:14] and and and and and he is life and the
[26:17] word is Christ amen and so it's all the
[26:19] same thing praise the Lord so
[26:24] um so speaking about uh with predestined
[26:28] let's talk about that here for just a
[26:30] moment
[26:32] amen you look at the woman at the well
[26:34] amen praise God she had to hear the word
[26:37] at some point amen and when the word
[26:40] come to the word then it it it sprung to
[26:42] life amen praise God you see so it has
[26:46] to be amen that that that word has to
[26:49] already be gerti Amen in God's mind Amen
[26:53] brother brandham called it amen uh uh PR
[26:56] uh what is it the predestined ation of
[27:00] uh representation of predestination Amen
[27:03] in other words there had to be a
[27:04] representation already in God's mind in
[27:07] order for something to already to spring
[27:09] up amen praise God uh so if you were
[27:13] that's why the Pharisees they could not
[27:15] amen receive or accept that word amen
[27:17] because it wasn't in God's
[27:20] mind they had the opportunity just like
[27:22] the woman at the well but the
[27:24] representation wasn't there Amen in
[27:26] order for that to come to actually come
[27:29] to pass now if you think about
[27:31] representation a representation is like
[27:33] an image
[27:34] right right and image is just uh the
[27:40] picture of what really is right let's
[27:44] take brother Brandon would use for
[27:46] example uh you can't get warmed by a
[27:48] painted fire all right I could put here
[27:51] on these screens Brother Anderson could
[27:53] put here um pictures or a a video
[27:59] of a nice warm uh uh fire right in
[28:05] inside of inside of inside a uh a
[28:08] fireplace and you might be here cold
[28:10] maybe the the heat isn't working in here
[28:12] and uh right now we don't need the heat
[28:14] but what I'm saying maybe it's very cold
[28:16] in here sometimes I know I know some the
[28:19] ones that come and open the the the the
[28:21] church house and if it's cold outside
[28:23] it's very cold in here as well brother
[28:25] Terence I'm sure you you probably know
[28:27] that but but and you know if you put on
[28:30] a screen on the screen a a fireplace
[28:33] just Flames coming up very nice I mean
[28:36] there can even be stockings there and
[28:38] and it's just very nice and and you can
[28:40] even hear the crackling and and
[28:43] everything and you get up close to the
[28:49] screen well I'm not I'm not feeling
[28:51] anything you'll put your back in it why
[28:55] because it's a painted fire it's only a
[28:58] representation of what can
[29:01] be amen you see what I'm
[29:04] saying because it's not the real thing
[29:08] that's why when we say when Jesus when
[29:10] Jesus said that the lamb was slain
[29:13] before the foundation of the
[29:15] world but yet it needed to come here on
[29:18] Earth to actually come to pass because
[29:21] that was a representation of when Jesus
[29:24] really came and died for us on the cross
[29:26] of Calvary you see so that when they say
[29:29] that woman had representation it was
[29:32] because in God's mind he knew that down
[29:35] through time amen when Jesus was going
[29:38] to come and he was going to thirst there
[29:40] at the well and he told the disciples I
[29:42] must needs go about Samaria amen and
[29:45] then the woman was coming through with
[29:46] the water pot and and and maybe she was
[29:49] holding it here under her head and and
[29:51] and and then she's coming in and she
[29:52] sees that man sitting there and and and
[29:55] and he asks her give me a drink
[29:59] God is seeing this representation all
[30:01] this time amen and he could predestinate
[30:05] because he saw amen that she would amen
[30:07] want that word amen praise God therefore
[30:11] she had
[30:12] representation because the image right
[30:15] representation is the image or the or
[30:17] the thought amen because when you think
[30:20] things it's just a representation but
[30:22] it's not the reality yet amen but when
[30:25] you speak it or you go do it then that
[30:28] representation comes to life you see
[30:31] what I'm saying that might be a little a
[30:32] little hard to to to but I hope you
[30:35] understand amen for the kides here so
[30:39] it's very important amen that that that
[30:42] um so that woman amen she had
[30:44] representation but those Pharisees did
[30:46] not have representation because the same
[30:48] word came to them they heard the same
[30:50] word but yet they could not connect with
[30:53] it why cuz there was no representation
[30:56] amen they could not receive there was no
[30:58] gerti amen seed there or representing
[31:03] them you see praise God they had the
[31:06] same opportunity though and that's what
[31:09] I want you to realize amen that this
[31:11] world out here has the same opportunity
[31:13] that you and I have amen but yet you
[31:16] accept it amen aren't you thankful for
[31:19] that
[31:22] amen you received the word when it came
[31:26] to me you know I remember when
[31:29] uh I'm I'm you know I've told my
[31:31] testimony kind of it's been broken but I
[31:35] remember when when when this when when
[31:38] the brother there in Colombia South
[31:40] America he he was telling us about this
[31:42] message and and telling and and we had
[31:45] already been through several churches
[31:47] the Baptist Church we were at the
[31:48] Baptist Church during that time and and
[31:51] the brother said you know he he was
[31:53] telling us about a prophet you know that
[31:55] come in this day and uh
[31:58] and so my mom quickly because my mom was
[32:00] there in the room and and my dad was
[32:01] there and I was there and my mom quickly
[32:04] tells him and says uh but you know the
[32:06] Bible says that in the last day there'
[32:08] be false prophets now we're coming at it
[32:10] from a Baptist perspective right because
[32:13] a Baptist don't believe in prophets in
[32:15] this day doesn't believe in miracles
[32:17] doesn't believe in none of those things
[32:20] uh at least the fundamental Baptist that
[32:22] we came out of and so and so I remember
[32:25] the brother he says you know but but you
[32:28] know if there are false prophets amen
[32:31] then there must be true prophets in
[32:33] order for false prophets to come out of
[32:36] come out of oh that silenced us yes
[32:40] right and when he said that just
[32:43] something struck me right there amen and
[32:47] God just started working with me right
[32:48] there and then and because that that
[32:50] sounded that sounded so that that was
[32:53] like to me that was like woman give me a
[32:55] drink right yeah exactly
[32:58] there was something different that
[32:59] resonated different than what the pastor
[33:01] at the Baptist Church was preaching to
[33:03] me amen because it was truth amen and
[33:08] truth always sets you free amen amen it
[33:11] never confuses you more it never leaves
[33:15] you amen uh depressed or sad amen truth
[33:19] amen sets you free and he whom the sun
[33:22] set free and the Sun is truth is free
[33:25] indeed I'm so thankful for that the Lord
[33:28] Jesus
[33:30] amen amen so you have to know amen that
[33:33] that you you have to know amen that
[33:35] you're not just placed amen you're not
[33:38] just placed but rooted in Christ amen
[33:41] right praise God you're not just you're
[33:44] not just leaning on him amen but you are
[33:47] rooted in him amen is him in you and and
[33:51] and and I in him and him and you praise
[33:52] the Lord Jesus and so that's the reason
[33:56] why it's so important amen for us to be
[33:58] planted near near water amen amen
[34:01] wherever there's water and we know that
[34:03] water represents the word amen and the
[34:06] and the and the closer you are to the
[34:08] word amen the deeper amen the the the
[34:11] more green the more you can Thrive
[34:13] praise the Lord amen amen the further
[34:15] away you are from the word the more dry
[34:17] you'll
[34:18] get the more uh the more uh uh you know
[34:22] problems that you will have right if
[34:26] there's no tree that there's no plants
[34:28] no trees they get water amen then they
[34:30] they're going to have problems oh the
[34:32] sun will take care of it well Jesus said
[34:34] that the sun scorched that
[34:36] seed amen so it's not just enough the
[34:38] sun is not just enough and we know that
[34:41] Jesus represents the Sun as well amen
[34:43] praise God but you need both amen you
[34:46] need the Sun and you need water amen
[34:48] just like it just like in the fivefold
[34:50] ministry praise the Lord Jesus just like
[34:52] you are perfected amen by a fful
[34:54] Ministry you need the word right amen
[34:58] and the fful ministry is preaching the
[35:00] word amen so you need both praise the
[35:03] Lord but it's not just it's not the fful
[35:05] ministry that perfects you it's the Holy
[35:07] Ghost through that fful Ministry that
[35:09] perfects you and I I just want to make
[35:11] that clear amen because sometimes amen
[35:13] we could just say well you need the fful
[35:16] ministry and without me you can't get it
[35:17] amen you can't get it without the Holy
[35:19] Ghost that's why you can't get it amen
[35:22] you need the Holy Ghost to get it amen
[35:24] and the Holy Ghost preaching through the
[35:26] FF Ministry that's what gets it to you
[35:28] amen praise God that's what gets you
[35:30] perfected amen I can't perfect you I
[35:33] don't know what your problems are
[35:34] brother Wade can't perfect you amen the
[35:36] Holy Ghost has known you before the
[35:38] foundation of the world Amen he can
[35:40] perfect you amen praise God hallelujah
[35:42] and he does a great good Perfection amen
[35:46] I'm thankful for the Perfection that he
[35:47] does CU I can't my perfection is there
[35:50] no perfection in it amen praise the Lord
[35:53] amen I I I I I make a mess out of things
[35:57] amen I tell tell I tell people you know
[35:59] sometimes you know uh the other day we
[36:02] were at at a board meeting there at at
[36:03] Hall County and some some some technical
[36:06] things happened and I was up there
[36:08] trying to fix some things and uh and
[36:11] they said and they said something about
[36:13] a technician I said well yeah you know
[36:15] if we we computer guys if we can't fix
[36:18] it we just break
[36:19] it it's either we fix it or we break it
[36:23] more because there were trying to tr
[36:25] Tinker with it and mess with it and
[36:27] things like that and because you know we
[36:29] want to we want to see it's software
[36:31] wise as well and when they're tinkering
[36:34] with it so much amen if we're not fixing
[36:36] anything we just break it more amen
[36:38] might as well learn from it that you
[36:41] know praise God so I can't fix your your
[36:45] I can't do anything about your
[36:46] Perfection amen but Christ can
[36:48] Hallelujah but you got to stay amen uh
[36:51] uh connected to that Living Water amen
[36:54] and when we stay close to him amen we we
[36:57] don't need any artificial sources amen
[37:00] you don't need anything amen artificial
[37:02] to be placed amen around your life or or
[37:06] anything that that that seems like amen
[37:09] life amen you just need life amen that
[37:12] so that you can grow amen into him
[37:14] praise God now I want just want to talk
[37:17] for a moment about John the Baptist and
[37:20] I have some scriptures here you can read
[37:21] them in John chap 1: 22- 23 and uh in
[37:26] Matthew 11 11: 2-1 but in in John chap
[37:31] 1 uh when they came to to John the
[37:33] Baptist and they said who are you and he
[37:35] said I'm one the one crying in the
[37:37] wilderness make straight the way of the
[37:39] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah he knew
[37:42] where he was standing amen he knew what
[37:44] his calling was he knew where he was and
[37:46] and he connected himself in the word
[37:49] amen and that's why it's so important in
[37:51] this hour amen that you connect yourself
[37:53] back to the word amen that that you know
[37:56] amen what scpt scripture speaks to you
[37:58] where you are at in this word so that
[38:00] you can fulfill that word amen praise
[38:03] the Lord and so John the Baptist did
[38:05] that and when the Pharisees came and
[38:07] then when Jesus came he said amen Behold
[38:10] the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins
[38:13] of the world Amen he knew that it was
[38:15] him amen at that moment he was anointed
[38:18] amen and he knew exactly amen that that
[38:21] was the Lamb of God praise the Lord but
[38:24] then maybe several months later passed
[38:27] and and in Matthew 11: 2
[38:30] amen uh it says now when John had heard
[38:33] in the prison The Works of Christ he
[38:35] sent two of his disciples and said unto
[38:38] him art thou he that should come or do
[38:42] we look for
[38:44] another so John now he's he's he's
[38:47] doubting or he's asking if if if what he
[38:51] said that here comes the Lamb of God
[38:54] Amen who takes away the sin of the world
[38:56] that is him
[38:58] amen now he's wondering is it really
[39:01] him because now he's in a prison now
[39:05] he's in a state of of where he's not you
[39:09] know he can't be influential anymore
[39:12] right he can't he can't maybe he's not
[39:15] receiving the feedback like he was be
[39:17] with outside of prison so probably he
[39:19] his mind is going into a depressed state
[39:22] oh my those are dangerous times Saints
[39:25] amen because it's in those depressed
[39:26] States
[39:28] amen where you start doubting what you
[39:30] once thought was reality was the truth
[39:33] amen and if you're not careful and if
[39:34] you're not grounded if you're not rooted
[39:39] amen isn't those times amen those are
[39:41] critical critical
[39:44] times and so he John introduced the the
[39:47] the Messiah and later and later he he
[39:49] struggled but then Jesus keeps uh in
[39:51] that same in that same scripture amen he
[39:53] he he starts he starts telling the
[39:56] disciples to go tell John
[39:57] that the lame walk the blind see the de
[40:00] hear and all these different things and
[40:02] then even though John was doubting him
[40:06] he starts praising
[40:08] John oh
[40:11] my I'm just wondering amen that even in
[40:14] our doubts amen God still for us amen
[40:17] when you are doubting amen praise God
[40:20] now doubting sometime I know we say
[40:22] doubting sometimes is a bad thing and
[40:25] and it is you we should should not doubt
[40:28] his word but
[40:30] doubting now listen to this real
[40:33] carefully doubting amen could help us
[40:36] actually ground ourselves more in the
[40:39] word because it makes you look further
[40:42] to
[40:43] see all right if if if you just see if
[40:46] we if you just take things for for for
[40:49] face value and and just take oh well
[40:51] because my pastor said it and and you
[40:54] know brother so and so preaches and
[40:55] that's it you know then I accept it but
[40:58] you don't know it for
[40:59] yourself that's a problem see you you
[41:03] believe the right thing but that doesn't
[41:05] mean that your roots are are are are are
[41:08] long and and and and healthy and and
[41:11] something comes across your life and
[41:13] boom you're down like those trees in the
[41:15] back of my mom and dad's
[41:17] house so it doesn't mean that you just
[41:20] you're you you know the truth amen
[41:22] you've been in the message church for 50
[41:24] years and then you know oh my my roots
[41:26] they're grounded no let's give you the
[41:29] word
[41:30] test and the word test amen comes in by
[41:34] by experiences amen
[41:36] surprises amen situations things come in
[41:41] amen are will you stand for that word or
[41:43] will you just go ahead and just cleave
[41:45] on to the to to whatever situation you
[41:47] fall amen and you just give in give way
[41:50] to
[41:51] that so it's very important amen that we
[41:55] we be we be grounded and rooted amen
[41:57] Amen in the word that we live in amen
[42:00] and that we not just say Amen that I I
[42:03] believe this message amen but we know
[42:05] what this message is
[42:06] about we know what it's about amen so G
[42:10] so so doubts and
[42:14] questions uh those are healthy things
[42:17] really if you look at them because if
[42:19] God has really done a work in your heart
[42:23] amen you're going to go and look further
[42:26] in the word
[42:28] there's an answer to this because
[42:30] brother brandham said if there is a
[42:31] Bible question then there's a Bible
[42:34] answer if there's a question about
[42:37] anything right because listen Thomas
[42:39] even
[42:42] doubted and Jesus had so much mercy and
[42:44] so much grace he said I'm going to
[42:47] Thomas per I'm going in that room
[42:49] personally to minister to Thomas
[42:52] everybody in there all the disciples in
[42:54] there and he personally had
[42:56] Thomas look at my
[42:58] hands amen so he cares amen he he he
[43:01] knows and he knows what our struggles
[43:03] are and he knows what we're thinking our
[43:05] questions are so it's good now and then
[43:07] that's why we have questions and
[43:09] answers amen praise the lord it's good
[43:12] to have
[43:14] questions it's good to have doubts but
[43:16] not let the doubt amen hinder your walk
[43:18] with
[43:20] Christ let the doubt amen give you clo
[43:23] get you closer to the word because the
[43:25] doubt raises questions and the questions
[43:28] amen will will well it'll take a true
[43:30] Christian back to the word looking
[43:32] through the message amen and that's that
[43:35] and that's what studying
[43:37] is that's what studying is you know many
[43:39] there's many times many things that I
[43:41] learned amen that that by questions that
[43:44] I had and when you have questions amen
[43:48] then it makes you go into the word get
[43:50] in the word further and then you're
[43:52] there forever and you and you probably
[43:54] get more than what you were what you
[43:56] were asking for amen praise God Amen
[44:01] so
[44:03] uh so then Jesus he says here he says
[44:06] verily I say unto you among them that
[44:07] are born of women there hath not risen a
[44:10] greater than John the Baptist
[44:13] amen and then he says notwithstanding he
[44:16] that is the least he that is least in
[44:18] the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[44:21] amen he's speaking about you and me amen
[44:25] he's speaking about you amen who are the
[44:27] least amen of the Kingdom of Heaven why
[44:30] because John the Baptist could not
[44:33] experience the new birth like you and me
[44:35] can amen this hour praise God and so
[44:39] you're greater than even John the
[44:41] Baptist amen even though Jesus amen gave
[44:44] him all the flowers amen while living
[44:46] amen your life with the Holy Ghost is
[44:49] greater than even John the Baptist
[44:52] praise the Lord Jesus amen only because
[44:55] of the holy of the indwelling of the
[44:57] Holy Ghost and the new birth amen praise
[44:59] the Lord all right let I'm me skip a
[45:01] couple of things here all right so that
[45:03] word amen it must take root in US amen
[45:05] the word made flesh it cames to it came
[45:08] to John so how does it come to us amen
[45:10] how does the word come to us
[45:12] amen praise God we don't have to just
[45:15] have the word come to us but thank God
[45:17] we can have the word in US amen and
[45:20] that's that's that's the that's the most
[45:22] important thing amen praise God Amen
[45:25] John John he could see the word coming
[45:28] to him in flesh but Jesus said in John
[45:30] 20:29 blessed are those that have not
[45:33] seen but yet believed amen praise God we
[45:36] can experience God more deeply than John
[45:38] did because we have the fullness of his
[45:40] spirit amen praise the Lord amen I'm so
[45:43] thankful amen that in this hour it's
[45:45] counted unto us amen a a a blessing a
[45:49] faith amen that you were not there you
[45:51] didn't experience certain things amen
[45:53] but yet you believed amen and you and
[45:56] you said Amen to the word praise God
[45:59] John saw the word coming to him he even
[46:01] touched it he he baptized the word amen
[46:04] he baptized Jesus amen he experienced it
[46:07] amen praise God but you are greater amen
[46:10] because the word now lives in you amen
[46:12] and you can live it amen and you're not
[46:14] just baptizing but you go get baptized
[46:17] amen and you actually live out this word
[46:19] amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful for
[46:21] that Amen brother brandom says here was
[46:24] John on Earth making the written word
[46:26] live live he was the voice of one crying
[46:29] in the wilderness and he always also was
[46:31] preparing the way before the Messiah and
[46:34] Jesus said you love to walk in his light
[46:36] because he was that light bright and
[46:38] Shining Light amen praise God now let's
[46:42] talk about Roots here for just a moment
[46:45] and I'm and and I appreciate your
[46:46] patience amen and uh we just thank you
[46:49] for for listening to that
[46:52] tonight so what is a root amen and and
[46:55] who is the root and The Offspring of
[46:58] David amen now now here's where just
[47:01] listen to this here real quick what is
[47:03] the root and the basic functions of
[47:04] roots roots are the principal organ for
[47:07] the absorption of water and dissolved
[47:10] nutrients in most seed plants and Fern
[47:12] and in ferns the root also anchors the
[47:16] plant body and can store reserved Foods
[47:20] all right so all this happens is not
[47:22] just drinking all at once but it also
[47:25] stores nutrients and water inside the
[47:28] roots Roots usually grow beneath the
[47:32] surface of the soil and extend from the
[47:35] base of the stem some Roots however grow
[47:37] above the ground from branches or leaves
[47:40] these roots either penetrate the soil or
[47:43] become attached to another plant or
[47:45] object as they grow now now I I I I
[47:50] thought this was interesting here the
[47:52] single root that develops from the seed
[47:55] so when that when that seed seeds ger
[47:57] germinate is germinated or germinates
[48:00] right that little comes out there's a
[48:02] little root that comes out right it
[48:04] might be a little flimsy amen but it's a
[48:08] root you got to start somewhere amen it
[48:12] might be flimsy but you have to start
[48:14] somewhere amen don't don't underestimate
[48:17] amen your walk with Christ amen young
[48:19] people when you start oh I might not
[48:22] have the F the faith of of the pastor I
[48:24] might not have the faith of my dad or I
[48:25] might not have the faith amen but you
[48:27] started that means you got a little root
[48:30] amen amen and so it's got to be taken
[48:33] care of right this single root that
[48:36] develops from the seed or from the base
[48:38] of a stem in the case of ferns is called
[48:42] the primary root amen and that's why
[48:46] that's why I said that you know that's
[48:47] why the Bible calls Jesus amen that he
[48:50] is the root and The Offspring of David
[48:52] amen so that primary root amen that's
[48:55] Christ amen or that types Christ amen
[48:58] praise God that's that's what that's
[49:00] what causes amen that growth in in your
[49:02] life amen praise God and it's because
[49:05] you are you are drinking from the
[49:07] fountain amen praise the Lord Jesus and
[49:10] in another place Jesus is called the
[49:12] root uh an offspring of David amen
[49:14] praise the Lord Jesus so it's very
[49:16] important to start somewhere amen you
[49:20] you you you you you don't know where to
[49:21] start amen start reading your word the
[49:24] Bible amen start listen listening to
[49:27] good things amen praise God that'll help
[49:29] that that'll help start amen that that
[49:31] germination in your in in in in that
[49:34] that word amen comes to fruition and
[49:37] it'll start building those little Roots
[49:39] amen and the The Roots just didn't amen
[49:41] it wasn't hundreds and thousands of
[49:43] roots that just came from that little
[49:44] seed why because that will just kill
[49:47] that seed if that's what happened amen
[49:49] but it's got to start little amen and
[49:52] it's got to start tender oh I know this
[49:53] sounds simple and and it might be boring
[49:56] to you but amen Jesus used it as an
[49:58] example so amen we so we need it praise
[50:02] God Amen but that's the reason why
[50:05] Saints amen that people wither away amen
[50:09] it's because they start amen they start
[50:12] and and and and and they might have this
[50:13] little root coming in amen but they
[50:15] don't take care of it praise God and
[50:20] they allow other things in this life
[50:21] amen uh uh to just just choke them
[50:26] praise the Lord
[50:27] amen and so this is the hour a that
[50:30] people they're falling away amen amen
[50:33] but I'm so glad I'm looking at people
[50:34] that haven't fallen away amen praise the
[50:37] Lord Jesus somebody's got to fulfill
[50:40] amen scriptures amen praise God so the
[50:45] seeds that lack Deep Roots amen they
[50:47] always wither
[50:49] away and and that's usually it's
[50:51] symbolic of weak Faith amen you have to
[50:55] be you have to have faith faith that
[50:57] what God started he will perfect it amen
[51:00] praise the Lord
[51:02] Jesus I know many of us we've served God
[51:04] for a long time and and and uh but
[51:08] there's some there's some that you know
[51:10] they're just starting out amen praise
[51:12] the Lord and uh and they need amen they
[51:16] need a little you know a little come on
[51:20] you can do
[51:21] it you can do it amen we' we we've
[51:24] conquered we've made it through amen I
[51:26] know you can amen cuz you had to start
[51:29] this exact same way praise the Lord a
[51:32] little root a little primary roote amen
[51:35] that you took care of and God did the
[51:37] rest of the growth praise the
[51:39] Lord now I want to talk about the soil
[51:41] here for just a moment amen and and I
[51:44] see uh like the soil is almost like it's
[51:47] like the life of the believer amen
[51:49] praise God because because if you look
[51:52] at the soil Saints the soil doesn't look
[51:54] attractive it does it looks dirt it's
[51:56] dirty it's
[51:57] dirt it it might be black it might be uh
[52:01] Brown and and and and and it gets really
[52:04] uh it gets on your shoes and and it and
[52:07] it stains your Nikes and and it just you
[52:11] have to clean it up you know but that
[52:15] that is what is needed in order for
[52:17] there to be growth because in in the
[52:21] light in the soil and that's why I say
[52:23] it's the light it's like the life of the
[52:24] believer amen there's NE nutrients in it
[52:28] there's there's minerals in there there
[52:30] are things that the roots are taken in
[52:33] in order for it to their for for there
[52:35] to be growing amen praise the Lord so
[52:39] life the Christian Life Saints it's it's
[52:40] not always uh a flowery bed of ease and
[52:44] it's not always easy amen but it it's
[52:46] dark and murky sometimes actually
[52:49] probably most of the
[52:51] time amen but but but the sun amen also
[52:56] hits the soil just like it hits the
[52:57] plant you see and so the soil also
[53:00] enjoys the sunlight and it also enjoys
[53:03] the rain and it also amen so good times
[53:05] and bad times come upon not just the
[53:07] plant but also the soil this life is
[53:09] this way amen I'm not saying that the
[53:11] Christian's life is always a depressing
[53:13] thing and all and it shouldn't be amen
[53:15] God restore us our joy if we're if we're
[53:18] losing our joy amen restore to me the
[53:20] joy of thy salvation Lord and renew a
[53:24] right Spirit Within Me amen and I
[53:26] believe that's what a a Christian always
[53:28] wants amen because whenever you're
[53:30] looking for something else out there
[53:31] amen some entertainment some some
[53:34] something amen some Facebook or or some
[53:36] Instagram uh feeds or or or or YouTube
[53:39] videos or constant amen that's because
[53:41] you're lacking the joy of the Lord in
[53:43] your life amen the joy of the Lord in
[53:45] your life is not able to keep you so
[53:47] therefore you have to go and Main and
[53:49] get temporary joy in order for for that
[53:52] to and you think that that's good and
[53:55] you think that that's that that
[53:56] satisfies but the reason why you're back
[53:59] again Doom
[54:00] scrolling is because you weren't
[54:02] satisfied in the first
[54:04] place amen so that's why we need to have
[54:07] the joy of the Lord amen so this
[54:10] Christian life it doesn't look it
[54:12] doesn't look uh uh attractive amen but
[54:15] it's in this life amen in this
[54:18] soil uh that that we need that soil Amen
[54:21] in order to keep to keep the growth Amen
[54:24] in that soil we encounter many trials
[54:26] but trials makes us stronger
[54:29] amen praise the Lord Jesus now I was
[54:32] reading a a story uh about a man his
[54:35] name was Parnell Bailey and um
[54:40] he he visited an Orange Grove one time
[54:45] where an irrigation pump had
[54:47] failed and and in that
[54:50] season the season was very dry and it
[54:53] was it was uh very it was unusual
[54:56] usually dry and some of those orange
[54:58] trees they were dying because because
[55:00] they were lacking water amen so that
[55:03] tour guide that was there touring
[55:06] Parnell Bailey he he took him he he
[55:09] showed him those trees and he saw how
[55:11] they were dying but then he took them
[55:13] over to another Grove and it was his
[55:16] personal
[55:17] Grove and he says now look at look look
[55:20] at these trees and he explained that his
[55:22] trees they could probably survive
[55:25] another two weeks with Without
[55:27] Rain and so the parel belly asks well
[55:30] what's the difference between these
[55:32] trees and and and these trees and
[55:35] so he tells them that he intentionally
[55:38] withheld water from them in order to
[55:42] encourage them to stretch out their
[55:46] roots in order to seek more
[55:49] water and that that's the reason why he
[55:52] he he would not allow them to have water
[55:55] constantly so that they could go out
[55:57] seeking for more amen that so that they
[56:01] could do it on their own oh
[56:03] my praise the Lord amen that's the
[56:08] reason why it can't be a flowy bed of
[56:10] ease all the time for you that's why
[56:13] things can't always be easy for us
[56:15] Saints amen because you've got to
[56:17] sometimes doubts come sometimes
[56:19] questions come amen but that's what gets
[56:21] you Amen to look into the word further
[56:23] amen that's what gets you Amen to look
[56:26] into the water amen that can give you
[56:28] life amen that can sustain you then
[56:30] praise the Lord amen just like these
[56:32] orange trees amen uh uh they they he he
[56:36] the master or the master planter
[56:38] intentionally did that oh my you might
[56:41] say well why is God allowing this in our
[56:44] life this just completely uh uh this
[56:48] this this hurts you bad amen whatever it
[56:51] is financially spiritually or whatever
[56:53] it may be amen but God knows amen that
[56:55] that's going to cause you to get on your
[56:57] knees Amen to seek for him amen praise
[57:01] God and he knows that you're going to do
[57:03] that therefore he allows it in your life
[57:06] amen praise the
[57:08] Lord and and therefore his trees amen
[57:13] they develop the deepest roots in that
[57:17] area and so all those other trees amen
[57:20] they were dying in that drought and they
[57:22] were amen his trees were still
[57:24] thriving why because they had really
[57:27] deep deep roots amen praise the Lord
[57:30] amen How Deep Is Your Walk In Christ
[57:32] amen praise God mistakes and troubles
[57:35] amen they may come amen the elements out
[57:40] out here amen they may be making the
[57:42] bark fall off your
[57:44] tree things amen may be coming off amen
[57:48] but praise God those roots are still
[57:50] grounded and rooted in Christ amen
[57:53] praise the Lord you might make mistakes
[57:55] young people amen you might fall praise
[57:59] the Lord Jesus amen but if you're rooted
[58:00] in Christ amen you don't have to
[58:03] worry your life is safe in Christ amen
[58:06] praise the Lord Brother Bram says that
[58:08] Faith's resting place is in the word of
[58:12] God Amen so the importance of being
[58:16] active Amen in the word is so so
[58:18] important in the hour that we're living
[58:20] in Amen in every hour praise the Lord it
[58:24] was very important in sister C in your
[58:26] time to be active and and faithful in
[58:29] the word and if it was in her time that
[58:31] still amen it's even more in our time
[58:34] amen because we are living in such a
[58:37] deceiving age brother brandham says Amen
[58:40] in in the message the Third Exodus Faith
[58:42] looks at the word but Faith places
[58:46] itself upon the unmovable Rock God's
[58:49] Eternal word amen Faith don't look at
[58:53] reason amen I don't care how much you
[58:56] can show it it would be better if the
[58:58] word says no faith rests there that is
[59:03] the sanctuary of Faith's resting place I
[59:07] like that amen that is the sanctuary of
[59:10] Faith's resting place amen amen so I'm
[59:13] so thankful for that but you know if he
[59:15] is the the root and offspring of David
[59:17] if he is the vine and we are the
[59:19] branches I'm so glad that he took it for
[59:22] us before we even came through with it
[59:24] amen I like what he says there we'll
[59:26] we'll finish with this in John chapter
[59:28] 16 verse 32 he says behold the hour
[59:31] cometh yay is now come that ye shall be
[59:35] scattered every man to his own and shall
[59:37] leave me alone and yet I am not alone
[59:40] because the father is with me in verse
[59:43] 33 he says these things I have spoken
[59:45] unto you that in me in me he doesn't say
[59:50] on me the disciples were leaning on him
[59:53] that didn't give him the new birth
[59:55] though
[59:56] amen but in me ye might have peace Amen
[1:00:01] in the world ye shall have
[1:00:04] tribulation he he didn't say you might
[1:00:07] have amen but you shall have
[1:00:09] tribulation but then he says but be of
[1:00:12] good cheer amen because I have overcome
[1:00:16] the world Amen if he could withstand it
[1:00:20] he withstood it amen the root and
[1:00:23] offspring of David amen he withstood it
[1:00:26] he did it for you and me amen if we're
[1:00:28] connected in him praise God then that
[1:00:30] that means we can do it as well amen how
[1:00:33] many believe that amen because he has
[1:00:36] overcome the world and I'm an overcomer
[1:00:38] with him amen and there's nothing amen
[1:00:40] that you and I need to worry about oh
[1:00:43] sure we're going to get hit amen we're
[1:00:45] going to get hit I mean so sometimes
[1:00:47] we're going to get amen knocks amen
[1:00:50] financially sometimes we're going to get
[1:00:52] hit amen knocks Amen on your health amen
[1:00:56] expected
[1:00:57] things praise God but you know they uh
[1:01:01] they say that you know you you should
[1:01:03] have a uh uh an emergency fund amen for
[1:01:08] unexpected things for when you know uh
[1:01:10] Murphy starts you know rubbing on on on
[1:01:15] that engine in your car he just constant
[1:01:18] banging on it you
[1:01:19] know all right it's just uh you know and
[1:01:24] sometimes he might go and start rubbing
[1:01:26] on that air unit you know in your house
[1:01:28] you
[1:01:29] know and then starts making weird noises
[1:01:32] and then all of a sudden amen as June
[1:01:34] 21st
[1:01:36] hits It's
[1:01:39] Gone
[1:01:41] amen but you see Saints amen uh Murphy
[1:01:44] is going to be there all the time amen
[1:01:47] amen but if if you have placed amen your
[1:01:50] faith in that emergency fund amen in
[1:01:54] Christ emergency fund amen
[1:01:56] praise God then he can he can answer
[1:01:58] back amen with something he's gone
[1:02:00] through it
[1:02:01] already and he knows exactly what you
[1:02:04] need at the moment that you need it amen
[1:02:06] praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful
[1:02:08] for that amen how many love the Lord
[1:02:10] tonight so let's let's let's think about
[1:02:12] our growth in Christ amen is it deep
[1:02:16] rooted or is it shallow rooted amen do
[1:02:19] do H how deep am I in this word amen I'm
[1:02:23] when I say that I'm not saying amen
[1:02:25] you've got to go look for the Hebrew and
[1:02:26] the Greek of every word amen as you're
[1:02:28] reading the the Bible you've got
[1:02:30] to you know do this that let no I mean
[1:02:34] that's good that's that's good but but
[1:02:36] amen has that life the life of the word
[1:02:39] is it speaking to you because the life
[1:02:42] of the word is what we want amen when
[1:02:44] you get that word and you say oh my I am
[1:02:47] convinced and concerned and then I go
[1:02:50] out and live it amen I put it to
[1:02:52] practice that is what's grow making
[1:02:55] those roots grow out bigger amen man the
[1:02:58] roots are moving roots are moving amen
[1:03:01] they're not just taking in and then just
[1:03:03] staying still but when they're taking in
[1:03:05] they're getting longer and they're doing
[1:03:07] something amen they're moving and that's
[1:03:11] that's what a Christian does Amen it

[1:05:14] you know my family doesn't live didn't
[1:05:16] live here in the
[1:05:18] states so there's not too many
[1:05:21] [Laughter]
[1:05:22] records and so I could only get so far I
[1:05:27] can only get to probably about my um uh
[1:05:32] one of my parents uh I think my mom's
[1:05:34] side uh her her grandmother and that's
