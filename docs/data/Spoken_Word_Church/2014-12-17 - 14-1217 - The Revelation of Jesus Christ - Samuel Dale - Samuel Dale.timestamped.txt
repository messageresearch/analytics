[11:36] way I really want to get on over
[11:38] into uh more my point but I want to get
[11:41] this out of the way to kind of lay a
[11:44] foundation and then we will be speaking

[12:56] your love in Jesus name
[12:59] amen
[13:01] Revelations
[13:04] 1 and we'll read about 1
[13:10] through3 it says the revelation of Jesus
[13:14] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[13:18] unto his servants things which must
[13:21] shortly come to
[13:23] pass and he sent and signified it that's
[13:27] now and he sent and signified it by his
[13:29] Angel unto his servant John who by
[13:32] record of the word of God and the
[13:33] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[13:35] things that he saw blessed is he that
[13:38] readeth and they that hear the words of
[13:41] this prophecy and keep those things
[13:44] which are written therein for the time
[13:47] is at hand you may be seated the Lord at
[13:50] his Blessing I've preached on this many
[13:54] times before but I just want to get kind
[13:56] of a little thought into her mind and it
[13:58] will help us to understand later you
[14:01] know how that I've tried to bring it
[14:02] there to me where it says and the time
[14:04] is at hand I believe this is the time
[14:08] right right cuz when else would it be
[14:11] you know uh if we believe we're the end
[14:14] time people if we believe this is the
[14:17] end of the world has come upon us then
[14:19] the time is at hand the time to
[14:21] what the time to understand right right
[14:26] the time for it to be made reveal
[14:28] remember in the adoption over re over in
[14:31] Romans 8 it's a time to wit the
[14:35] Redemption of our body the time to
[14:38] understand the Redemption of our body
[14:41] all right so I believe this is the time
[14:43] to
[14:44] understand you know the revelation of
[14:47] Jesus Christ now brother brandom says it
[14:51] like this I didn't give these to the
[14:53] brothers to do up but on the patmas
[14:56] vision he's reading the scripture of the
[14:59] Alpha and Omega the coming down and
[15:01] we'll read in just a minute and he says
[15:04] before I show you
[15:07] anything I want you to I want to let you
[15:10] know who I
[15:14] am that's what he's saying to the
[15:17] church other words before we cons cons
[15:21] anything before we go on any
[15:23] further the main thing is what to know
[15:27] who I am him he says the greatest of all
[15:32] the
[15:33] revelations is the deity the Supreme
[15:37] deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't
[15:41] get to first base until you believe that
[15:45] all right now that should be what you
[15:48] know our
[15:50] thoughts then he goes on you know later
[15:53] in the message and he says all right the
[15:55] first of all Revelation is the Supreme
[15:57] deity of Jesus Christ you must know who
[16:00] he is when you hear the voice amen now
[16:04] we'll get to that on later in further
[16:07] into the message see if you don't know
[16:10] who he is how would you know the
[16:14] voice you remember there's many
[16:17] voices there's many things you know that
[16:19] goes in a lot of ways I was sitting back
[16:21] there a while ago and and uh enjoyed
[16:24] sister Peggy singing but when they got
[16:27] to going into the next song we had two
[16:29] people playing I was going to say this
[16:31] cuz if anybody on the internet you know
[16:33] caught it there was two people playing
[16:36] and I put my hearing aid in today and
[16:39] thought I'd start using it I thought I'm
[16:41] getting rid of this
[16:43] sucker cuz I'm getting to to two thing
[16:47] and it was a little mess up that didn't
[16:49] get turned correctly but I would I
[16:53] thought I throwing this thing away just
[16:54] bringing in two things I'm getting what
[16:57] used to be but now
[17:01] listen what is the greatest of all
[17:04] Revelations the Supreme deity of Jesus
[17:08] Christ all right now the prophet says
[17:12] Christ mystery of God revealed I said
[17:14] we've been through this many times he
[17:17] says that is the
[17:20] Revelation that would reveal all things
[17:22] when he would come back to the church
[17:23] Age series with
[17:25] it is what the revelation
[17:29] of Jesus
[17:31] Christ now you can't go anywhere he said
[17:33] you you can't get to first base you
[17:36] know if you don't start out with the
[17:39] right Revelation well now where would a
[17:42] uh trinitarian come up with it see how
[17:46] can they
[17:47] comprehend because you can't get down to
[17:50] where he says I'm the alpha and the
[17:53] Omega well you know a trinity would be
[17:56] glad to say oh yeah he's the alpha
[17:58] and God's the Omega and the Holy Ghost
[18:01] is all in between I guess and we can you
[18:03] know we can juggle it around but we know
[18:05] that won't work all right but the
[18:10] revelation of his Supreme
[18:13] deity now I will say this to
[18:17] emphasize because I've always tried to
[18:20] do
[18:22] that I don't believe you can
[18:26] understand who you are
[18:29] until you first know who he is all right
[18:35] now so then that would be the
[18:38] foundation is to know who he is then we
[18:42] can talk about who we are because
[18:44] there's no bride there's no uh sunship
[18:47] there's none of those things without the
[18:51] first being of him all right now but
[18:55] then he turns around
[18:58] all right and he in the Book of
[19:01] Revelations never reveals
[19:04] himself apart
[19:07] from his
[19:12] people that's what he
[19:14] does because see he
[19:17] knows that
[19:19] we you know
[19:22] cannot
[19:25] comprehend uh an eternal God
[19:29] so he does everything he can to try to
[19:32] bring us to a
[19:34] position to where that we can get a
[19:37] little idea and I say that truthfully
[19:41] cuz I've you know how I've taught you
[19:43] that here you know that I've taught you
[19:45] I believe what we get here whatever
[19:48] amount we get here is just a little
[19:51] bitty
[19:52] background that when we get over
[19:55] there you know it'll be just enough to
[19:58] get us started and really just enough to
[20:01] get us there and I wouldn't mind saying
[20:03] it all just barely enough to get us
[20:05] there I don't mind saying it that way if
[20:08] you'll understand what I mean I mean
[20:11] that he's going to reveal what we have
[20:12] need of to get us there all right but if
[20:17] he doesn't reveal that how are we going
[20:19] to get there well what does it matter my
[20:22] brother used to say what does it matter
[20:25] about all this you know as long as we
[20:27] get that
[20:29] there well that's a good point you know
[20:31] that's all right
[20:33] but I I'd like to know where there is
[20:37] and I kind of like to know how we got
[20:39] there you know I don't like to go
[20:41] anywhere that I don't know where I'm
[20:43] going you know I remember one time I was
[20:47] going down the highway it used to bother
[20:48] me to ride New Roads you know doesn't
[20:50] matter how much you talk about well this
[20:52] road but it always bothered me to go a
[20:55] new route now if you ever take me one
[20:58] time 90% of the time I'll take you back
[21:00] there because you know I won't remember
[21:03] the roads but I can take you there all
[21:05] right but I was
[21:09] thinking you
[21:11] know why should I be concerned about
[21:13] this there's a highway in front of me
[21:17] somebody is made the
[21:20] highway and the signs along the road
[21:22] says you know Gainesville Georgia so
[21:26] that's the place I'm going so why should
[21:28] I be concerned about it and then it
[21:31] struck
[21:33] me you remember the children of Israel
[21:35] when they were coming out of
[21:37] Egypt it said Moses told the people says
[21:41] tell them to pull up together in other
[21:43] words get them in close just
[21:45] paraphrasing it he says because they
[21:48] haven't been this way before well then I
[21:52] realized that I had not been up and down
[21:54] that Highway because if I had I would
[21:57] have known where it was going and
[21:58] whatever it would be and uh but then it
[22:02] I realized that hey somebody
[22:06] has somebody's been there so I just get
[22:10] on the highways now and I just trust to
[22:13] signs and the things you know because
[22:16] somebody has been there well you know we
[22:19] don't have to worry about it somebody
[22:21] has been
[22:23] there and seen
[22:26] this John went to
[22:30] patmas saw these things come back and
[22:35] you know give them unto us put them in a
[22:38] book for us made it to a place that you
[22:42] and I would have an opportunity and
[22:44] that's why it says there and I love that
[22:46] where one day I was listening and where
[22:48] it says blessed is he that readeth and
[22:50] they that hear and I was listening to a
[22:53] t r around and said look there said it's
[22:55] a blessing just to be be able to
[23:00] read and I thought thank you
[23:03] Lord huh but you see I wasn't thinking
[23:07] like and it is it's a blessing because
[23:09] there's a lot of places in the world
[23:10] they can't read the Bible they don't
[23:12] have it it's not there and all but I
[23:16] what I was thinking I thought well a lot
[23:17] of people can hear it a lot of people
[23:19] can read and they get a blessing you
[23:21] know I'm not throwing off on any
[23:22] churches or anything they get a blessing
[23:24] from
[23:26] that but what about you and
[23:29] I that have the
[23:33] opportunity to hear the
[23:36] word without it being like it used to be
[23:41] to
[23:42] us you remember that you remember when
[23:45] you used to read maybe you read the book
[23:47] of Revelations you know maybe you read
[23:49] chapter one and you know the Revelation
[23:52] that God give to Jesus to give to John
[23:55] well look at there's got to be three of
[23:57] them
[24:00] right and see we we were so massivly
[24:04] confused until we knew nothing about it
[24:06] other than words of a page and that was
[24:09] a blessing i to read it but what about
[24:12] being able to read it with
[24:14] understanding of what the very
[24:17] author is trying to
[24:21] say you know that ought to make us
[24:24] rejoice you know greatly to know
[24:28] that we have been chosen to receive
[24:31] these things it is not a secret mystery
[24:36] that you and I are the only ones that
[24:38] understand the mystery we're this that
[24:40] or the other no it's available for
[24:43] everybody right but now everybody's not
[24:46] going to receive it amen because they
[24:49] can't right and the reason they can't is
[24:52] the way they chose
[24:53] it they chose it to be that way so it's
[24:56] the problem is our choosing well see we
[25:00] should say well I choose to read you
[25:04] know I've chosen the message so my point
[25:08] shouldn't be to try to read the message
[25:11] that you and I have received from the
[25:13] prophet of God and to try to figure it
[25:15] out any more than to try to figure out
[25:18] the Bible itself you
[25:22] know now to study it ponder over it pray
[25:26] about it search it out yes sir re I
[25:29] believe in that but then my final point
[25:32] is to come back to one thing if I can't
[25:34] find an
[25:37] answer why you look anywhere
[25:41] else right right if you can't find an
[25:45] answer why look anything else well then
[25:48] just stop shut up sit down
[25:51] listen and somewh the prophet said it
[25:53] like this one day he said God will put
[25:57] some somebody on the
[25:59] platform all right it may be a Baptist
[26:01] preacher it may be a Methodist preacher
[26:04] it may be a woman
[26:07] preacher but she can be used of God to
[26:10] speak to you
[26:12] amen right so we thank God for
[26:16] that but then how much more do we thank
[26:19] him for having a five-fold ministry
[26:22] right that we'll study out the message
[26:26] to find the answer in the
[26:28] message not to find it in G's Aline and
[26:31] everywhere else but to search out the
[26:34] message see we we're
[26:38] blessed to have the ability to think
[26:41] these things out and not look at it and
[26:44] think of a trinity and look at it and
[26:46] think of this and think of that and try
[26:49] to ponder this and try to wonder what
[26:51] this is and you know yourself that the
[26:54] first three verses there to most people
[26:58] the only thing they get out of it is an
[27:00] argumentative form over whether brother
[27:03] brandham come to John on patmas or
[27:07] not because it was Revelation that God
[27:10] gave to Jesus to give to John and he
[27:12] sent and signified by his
[27:14] Angel well I believe every been
[27:18] that I believe brother brandham come to
[27:20] bring the message to you and I but I
[27:23] don't believe he come to write the
[27:25] Bible John was the one chosen to write
[27:29] right so he didn't come to write it well
[27:33] see the other side of it is that people
[27:34] says well he come to bring it to John
[27:37] because he was a
[27:41] prophet I would walk very softly
[27:44] there because you're treading on
[27:47] dangerous
[27:48] territory and in doing it the best thing
[27:52] to do is to say well why what would it
[27:55] do us any good that's what I want to I
[27:57] told one brother one day I said what
[27:59] would it do you any good if you knew
[28:02] brother brandom came to John on
[28:07] platas would that make you in the
[28:11] Rapture would that save
[28:16] you but see it's tantalizing
[28:21] things and
[28:23] points I believe what the prophet
[28:26] said but believe it this way cuz one
[28:29] time he'll say it was a prophet that
[28:31] came to
[28:32] John all right well we can run with that
[28:35] but what he what about when he says it
[28:37] was not a prophet that came to
[28:40] John that God came
[28:46] himself what about what brother Brandon
[28:48] says that the The Book of
[28:51] Revelations his revelation of Jesus
[28:53] Christ given to John for Christians of
[28:56] all ages it's the only book in the
[28:59] entire Bible that is written by Jesus
[29:04] himself through personally appearing to
[29:09] a
[29:12] scribe brother Brandon says it like this
[29:15] he said the Book of Revelation is the
[29:17] only book that Jesus put his own hand of
[29:22] writing you know his ping his
[29:26] doing well see we try to figure out
[29:30] these
[29:31] things well what good would it do to
[29:34] figure it out and get it figured out is
[29:36] it going to save you that's right
[29:39] instead of looking at the revelation of
[29:41] Jesus Christ you realize what you're
[29:43] looking at is a revelation of William
[29:45] Brandon you're not looking at the
[29:47] revelation of Jesus
[29:52] Christ you're not depending upon
[29:55] God you're depending upon a prophet and
[29:58] thank God God sent us a prophet and I
[30:01] believe it I do I believe you and I
[30:05] would have never understood the Book of
[30:08] Revelations without God sending us the
[30:12] prophet that he promised in Malachi 4
[30:14] Luke 17:30 Revelations
[30:17] 10:7 Amen brother
[30:20] random because he come to bring that but
[30:24] he's not my
[30:26] God right the prophet of this day the
[30:30] brother brand said is the Holy
[30:35] Ghost well no no Holy Ghost is a spirit
[30:38] that's all you have to know about it you
[30:41] just studied all you've done and that's
[30:43] all you know your Prophet is one that
[30:46] said it was the Holy
[30:49] Spirit brother random wasn't the
[30:52] prophet he was a prophet now that's
[30:55] where he says it the prophet is the Lord
[30:58] Jesus
[31:00] Christ all right I simply asked one
[31:04] brother a question it meant a lot to me
[31:07] maybe it doesn't to you I said there's a
[31:09] lot of prophets in the
[31:11] bible and I said uh why would you want
[31:15] to pick one certain
[31:19] one you
[31:21] know well because it's you know it's our
[31:23] day it's our time it's our I said but
[31:26] why don't you say say that that was the
[31:29] prophet that come to John
[31:35] right now when you say it was the
[31:37] prophet cuz if you say brother brownon
[31:39] was the prophet you're making him Jesus
[31:40] Christ so now you're deity and don't
[31:42] even realize
[31:44] it all
[31:46] right but you see I know that by stating
[31:49] things I get into trouble I was thinking
[31:50] the other day and I was telling Brother
[31:52] Gary about it we got a little
[31:53] life and uh you know if I preach against
[31:58] people having a
[31:59] beard
[32:02] mustache you know some people here this
[32:05] ding some would go away thinking you
[32:08] don't like
[32:15] beard I preach
[32:17] against you
[32:19] know women and clothes and
[32:22] hir well he's just picking on
[32:26] those
[32:28] I preach on serpent seed
[32:31] here he knows I told him I didn't
[32:33] exactly agree with him on that so he's
[32:36] up there picking on
[32:38] me well when this is all over and said I
[32:41] was laughing because I would like for
[32:44] you to write me something I could
[32:48] preach that didn't get on to
[32:52] somebody all
[32:54] right so I just do the best I can do do
[32:58] and you're going to have to put up with
[32:59] that or find you another Pastor in which
[33:01] way you like
[33:02] it I just go on just be myself and don't
[33:06] come to me and say was you talking about
[33:09] me I'm going to say
[33:12] yes that's the best way to answer it is
[33:15] it cuz you got it all figured out that
[33:16] that's who I'm talking
[33:18] about well just say
[33:22] yes that's what I said leave that like
[33:24] it is don't say nothing about beards and
[33:27] he don't like them I preached one day an
[33:30] hour and a half on manifested sons of
[33:33] God you know went outside and this
[33:35] certain brother he come up some of you
[33:38] laughing because you probably stand out
[33:39] there when he did and he come up he said
[33:41] you don't believe in manifested sons of
[33:43] God do
[33:46] you I said I just preached an hour and a
[33:49] half to show what brother randam said
[33:51] about them and proving they were here
[33:54] you know but it don't make no difference
[33:56] so I just preach and forget it you know
[33:59] we do the best we
[34:01] can but see my point is not whether that
[34:05] was brother random that come to John on
[34:07] Patman what good would it be if we
[34:10] figured it
[34:11] out right there's no salvation in
[34:15] figuring out the letter of the
[34:20] word right the Salvation is the god of
[34:24] the word being delivered to you and I
[34:26] amen
[34:31] and we'll get down to it later on in a
[34:33] message or two later I know there's
[34:35] three times in the Book of Revelations
[34:37] that that it speaks of that John speaks
[34:39] that he fell down on his
[34:43] knees and talking to that
[34:46] Prophet but if I you it's in I'll give
[34:49] it to if you li it's in Revelations 1
[34:54] U
[34:55] 17
[34:57] all right it's Revelations 19 and
[35:01] 10 and it's in Revelations
[35:04] 22 1 through 10 or 12 or whatever down
[35:08] through there all
[35:10] right but if I was you I would go
[35:16] read because the one in
[35:18] 117 plainly tells you who he is that
[35:22] come to John and patas he says I'm the
[35:25] alpha and the Omega
[35:27] then that would make R random
[35:31] deity see people don't realize they what
[35:33] they're doing and run in Revelations
[35:36] 22 it flops from one side to deity
[35:40] because of your red letter Edition
[35:42] showing you who is
[35:44] speaking right is that the purpose of
[35:47] the red letter Edition well I don't
[35:49] believe the red letter Edition well
[35:50] that's all right but that's a purpose
[35:51] what it's in there for it simply means
[35:53] that God himself is speaking all right
[36:00] but you see we take that and without
[36:02] even trying to listen to the revelation
[36:04] of Jesus
[36:06] Christ cuz I believe that you're saved
[36:08] by revelation of Jesus Christ I believe
[36:11] you're healed by revelation of Jesus
[36:13] Christ I believe we'll be delivered out
[36:15] of this world in a Rapture One Day by
[36:18] the revelation of Jesus
[36:20] Christ I'm not looking for all of these
[36:22] things that everybody else is trying to
[36:24] find new names and all kind of things
[36:27] something to try to get us out of here
[36:30] when we wire out or get through using
[36:32] the name of Jesus and he wants to be
[36:33] something else let him be what he wants
[36:35] to be but until that time we must remain
[36:38] with what we've got and even after we
[36:40] leave out of here I thought it would be
[36:43] Jesus Christ that would go to the
[36:49] Jews I thought it would be Jesus Christ
[36:51] it would be sitting on the white
[36:55] throne
[36:57] you see but yet we're trying to find
[37:01] something come on I'm just as human as
[37:03] you are I told you about it first time I
[37:05] went to Jeffersonville we looked up her
[37:07] and over the the cross it said I in R
[37:11] well I was a dummy I didn't know what
[37:13] that
[37:15] meant
[37:18] sorry so I
[37:21] thought I found something I found me
[37:24] something I'm going to ask for the M
[37:26] this quick as I can and I went out to
[37:29] her and I didn't tell him what I was
[37:30] thinking I just told him I said hey what
[37:33] does that mean up there over the cross i
[37:36] n
[37:39] r he said it means Jesus Christ King of
[37:42] the Jews
[37:44] I I didn't never tell him what I was
[37:48] thinking so it's not wrong to search
[37:51] it's wrong to let your searches run into
[37:53] the you into the ground right to where
[37:56] you can't come up with an
[37:59] understanding see it's the revelation of
[38:02] Jesus
[38:03] Christ given to John
[38:08] right see it was given God gave Jesus
[38:12] the revelation of his own
[38:14] self because remember the story we can
[38:17] prove it show what the prophet he said
[38:19] there he was when Jesus was on Earth he
[38:22] said
[38:24] he at that time didn't
[38:28] understand what all of these things was
[38:31] going to
[38:32] be but said when he come to
[38:36] patmas did he knew you know when he come
[38:39] to patmas you know what he had done he
[38:41] had went from where he said I come from
[38:44] God and I go back to
[38:47] God
[38:49] right he had went
[38:51] back to the Supreme
[38:54] deity that's not three God gods or
[38:57] whatever that's more one God than
[38:59] anything in the
[39:01] world excuse me I love to holler but it
[39:05] runs that old throat out that's all
[39:07] right we just cough drop it and keep
[39:09] going all right well the main thing I
[39:12] want you to get
[39:14] tonight is not an argument
[39:17] over brother
[39:20] random if you if you want to believe he
[39:22] come to John on P that's your
[39:25] business I just don't believe it I
[39:28] believe it was the Lord Jesus
[39:30] Christ who came to John O patmas to
[39:34] bring him the
[39:36] Revelation that God had give him of
[39:39] himself right what says and it says and
[39:43] he delivered it or give it to his
[39:46] servants he sure
[39:48] did he had to give it to John right
[39:54] right come on John himself was a prophet
[39:57] he had to give him that to write it who
[39:59] wrote the Book of
[40:01] Revelations Jesus personally appearing
[40:03] to a
[40:05] scribe but the scribes want it wrote it
[40:07] down
[40:09] amen but you say well you're doing away
[40:12] with brother Brown was part on thank God
[40:14] because I said it while ago if it hadn't
[40:16] been for him you and I wouldn't know
[40:18] what the Book of Revelation was talking
[40:19] about on
[40:21] anything we give the honor to the
[40:25] honor
[40:27] he is the one that God chose to speak to
[40:30] us what is in the
[40:34] book and to bring that unto you and
[40:37] I about Jesus
[40:40] Christ as I said he
[40:43] said before I show you
[40:46] anything I want you to know who I
[40:52] am and look what he goes right straight
[40:54] through and I want you to I want you to
[40:57] think with me cuz I want them to pull up
[41:00] Revelations
[41:04] 1:4 and I want you to think about
[41:07] this and if I miss the number of the ANS
[41:11] you forgive me but I emphasize the word
[41:15] an can be changed to even right even and
[41:19] an is an interchangeable word where it
[41:22] says the God and father of our Lord
[41:24] Jesus Christ God and Father sounds like
[41:27] two people don't but why don't you read
[41:30] it God even
[41:33] father you don't have to do that in
[41:35] every case because in every case it
[41:36] doesn't translate as an
[41:40] and you know but I want you to listen to
[41:44] my point when we
[41:45] finish because he says I want you to
[41:49] know who I
[41:51] am before we go any
[41:54] further all right who is he
[41:58] who is this
[42:02] one and how you could spend I did before
[42:05] you know months on talking about the
[42:07] Revelation that God give to Jesus to
[42:09] give to John see if it wasn't true one
[42:12] true and living God where would we
[42:14] be and if it didn't if God did not
[42:17] descend down back there you know to be
[42:20] the Loos the speech the the Son of God
[42:23] the one to bring the word where would we
[42:26] be be right right right but look what he
[42:29] says here cuz now he didn't know his
[42:31] brother brandham said it he didn't know
[42:33] his part in the Kingdom that's a direct
[42:36] quote you desired be glad to get it for
[42:38] you but he said at this
[42:41] time when he came here he had went back
[42:45] to where he came
[42:46] from and there he
[42:48] stood now remember this one that's being
[42:52] described is just not the body of Jesus
[42:59] all
[43:01] right it's just not the Son of
[43:08] God it's just not the holy
[43:13] spirit it's not just the
[43:16] father that's being
[43:23] described it is all of that amen
[43:27] right father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus
[43:30] Christ it's all of that described in one
[43:37] form to show you who it
[43:40] is and remember this is the
[43:47] person the person of Jesus Christ which
[43:51] is the person of almighty God Amen right
[43:55] no father son Holy Ghost no
[43:57] trinitarianism no thoughts no Oneness
[44:01] idea because you do have all of these
[44:05] manifestations of father son Holy Ghost
[44:07] to make the one true and living God Amen
[44:10] all
[44:12] right and see then coming down to it
[44:14] look what he
[44:15] says John to the seven Church Ages which
[44:19] are in Asia Grace be unto you even peace
[44:24] from him
[44:26] which
[44:28] is even which
[44:30] was even which is to
[44:33] come even from the seven spirits which
[44:36] are before his
[44:38] throne not having to change something to
[44:41] make it fit you'll get to point in a
[44:45] minute even from Jesus
[44:48] Christ who is the faithful
[44:52] witness even the first begotten of the
[44:55] Dead
[44:58] even the prince of the kings of the
[45:00] earth unto him that loved us even washed
[45:04] us from our sins in his own
[45:06] blood even hath made us Kings and
[45:10] Priests unto God even his father to him
[45:13] be glory and Dominion forever even ever
[45:17] listening to a tape the other day where
[45:19] brother R was talking about said he made
[45:20] us Kings and Priests he said see there
[45:22] he didn't make him Kings and
[45:24] Priests
[45:27] he already was the king he already was
[45:31] the
[45:31] prince he made us what He Is
[45:37] Right
[45:41] Glory behold he cometh with clouds even
[45:45] every I shall see him even they which
[45:49] also P which pierced him even all
[45:53] kindreds of the Earth shall whail
[45:56] because of him even so
[46:00] amen I am Alpha even Omega the beginning
[46:05] even the ending sayth the Lord which is
[46:08] even which was even which is to come the
[46:14] almighty not to just make a a point of
[46:17] even and
[46:20] an the point
[46:23] is each one of those
[46:28] is the same
[46:31] person now you got the
[46:35] point you got the point
[46:37] now every one of them evens is going to
[46:40] bring you right into to
[46:42] describe
[46:45] something down here to show you I am
[46:49] Alpha even I'm the
[46:54] Omega I'm the all of
[46:56] it the beginning
[46:59] even the
[47:00] ending when he uses that word even or
[47:03] and he's going to give you a
[47:08] description of his
[47:12] personality that's why when we get over
[47:14] into the next message we'll be talking
[47:15] about for a while the Sevenfold Glory of
[47:18] his
[47:20] person all
[47:23] right but you get what I mean
[47:28] everything in there that's
[47:32] described is speaking of the same one
[47:36] true and living God
[47:41] Amen all of those ands ands ands and
[47:45] what did the prophet say when it comes
[47:47] to like and or this you know and two or
[47:50] something and he says there's something
[47:52] going to be two things connected that's
[47:56] paraphrasing the quote but it's close
[47:57] enough two things are going to be
[48:02] connected we see my point is you pull
[48:05] any of them hands out and you don't have
[48:08] a complete
[48:12] picture now let me illustrate that what
[48:16] if you took out the you got the
[48:18] descriptive form of him are you
[48:21] following
[48:24] me a person one
[48:28] person all right now what if you left
[48:30] the sixth verse
[48:39] out what if you took that
[48:45] out you would not have a complete
[48:49] picture even though you would have say
[48:51] and I'm just using that as an
[48:53] illustration see all the other end even
[48:56] translating you know would relate
[48:58] directly to his
[49:01] person but when you get to verse
[49:04] six look what it
[49:09] says and hath made
[49:16] us even priest unto
[49:19] God and to his father to him be glory
[49:22] and Dominion forever even
[49:28] ever you see now he's putting it in the
[49:32] perspective that he wants
[49:36] it because
[49:38] he's going to bring the church into
[49:43] view all
[49:45] right I didn't write the
[49:48] book
[49:51] I I'll bring this out more Sunday but
[49:54] you know that what is it Christ Myster
[49:55] of God revealed where brother brandom
[49:57] says the bride is part of the
[50:01] mystery and must be
[50:05] revealed that's
[50:07] right well now what if you reveal him
[50:10] and don't reveal
[50:13] her you got a
[50:16] problem but at the same time if you just
[50:19] run to her and make her the great
[50:22] things without it being what he made her
[50:25] look what you've
[50:33] done see him without
[50:35] us is one way of looking at
[50:39] it he could do something with it but us
[50:43] without him cannot be nothing done with
[50:48] it there's no
[50:53] hopes without him being
[50:57] first so the first thing he tells John
[51:00] look John before I talk to you you're
[51:02] here I'm going to send this to the
[51:05] churches I'm going to tell what it is
[51:07] and I'm going to show
[51:09] my
[51:11] my place and
[51:14] purpose in my
[51:16] person and where I'm going to
[51:21] be but John I first want you to know who
[51:23] I
[51:24] am
[51:27] I first want you to realize who I am and
[51:31] I want you to
[51:32] realize that me without
[51:36] you I can get along without
[51:41] you right he created us that's right he
[51:46] brought us into
[51:47] being but to display his attributes to
[51:50] do this that the other no he couldn't do
[51:52] it but still in the beginning he could
[51:54] have done without us
[51:58] right but said you can't do without
[52:02] me there's no
[52:04] way that you and I could be anything
[52:06] without him
[52:10] right see then that's what I see the
[52:12] people of the message
[52:15] doing even the ones that seem to
[52:19] try and I use that word maybe lightly
[52:24] but not throwing off on nobody at all
[52:26] but just saying
[52:31] it that you don't hear people preaching
[52:33] about Jesus Christ no
[52:35] more it's some kind of a seed or an
[52:39] attribute or this or that or the
[52:44] other well I didn't know there was any
[52:46] attribute whatsoever outside of Jesus
[52:49] Christ I mean that's the way I've always
[52:51] understood it to
[52:54] be because I thought all the attributes
[52:56] of God was displayed in Jesus Christ I
[53:00] mean you
[53:02] know but you know and you will if you'll
[53:06] think just a little bit and admit it to
[53:08] you that have have heard the things of
[53:10] the people of the message it preached
[53:12] there's always some kind of something
[53:14] pointing to
[53:17] them and their little
[53:20] group or
[53:22] doctrine or thought
[53:28] it's like I was trying my best to bring
[53:30] out Sunday a point
[53:32] on like the the grace of marriage and
[53:35] divorce and a lot of people believe if
[53:37] you wouldn't sitting there that
[53:39] day that there's no Grace for
[53:44] you you had to be sitting there that day
[53:47] some drop it down as long as you sitting
[53:50] there
[53:51] now you
[53:54] know but you just think people wouldn't
[53:56] believe that but they
[54:01] do I don't believe it's for everybody in
[54:03] the world no way I've made myself Plain
[54:05] on that don't go out there and try to
[54:08] explain marriage and divorce to a new
[54:11] convert you're messing it up you're
[54:14] killing the
[54:16] people well they need to know you didn't
[54:19] learn it that
[54:23] way but you see that's where it goes and
[54:25] then I start screaming and
[54:27] hollering why because that gets down
[54:29] within
[54:31] me to realize and think what the poor
[54:34] people of this message had had packed
[54:36] down their
[54:40] throats and yet you ask him no I don't
[54:43] believe
[54:44] that well no my pastor he doesn't
[54:47] believe that I
[54:51] said here here's the quotes that he put
[54:54] out
[54:55] well he was just saying what brother
[54:57] brandham
[55:02] said but listen
[55:05] Jer do you understand my
[55:09] point
[55:11] John don't you worry about
[55:15] nothing you just sat down under a shade
[55:19] tree and maybe he gets you a pencil and
[55:22] paper you know whatever he had
[55:25] something you write on and you write
[55:29] down what I tell
[55:33] you and said then you send it to the
[55:36] seven Church
[55:41] ages but I want you to know who I am
[55:47] John so what does he start off with pull
[55:50] back up forward and let's look down at
[55:51] it again with a thought then in mind of
[55:53] what we're looking at pull up Revelation
[55:57] 1:4 and let's start
[55:59] again to the church ages Grace Grace be
[56:01] unto you in peace from him which
[56:04] is which
[56:06] was and which is to
[56:11] come that's Hebrews
[56:14] 138
[56:16] right he which
[56:19] was Grace be peace he which was which is
[56:24] which was is to come that's right
[56:26] Hebrews 13:8 that's that he's the same
[56:29] yesterday today and forever and from the
[56:32] seven spirits all right see you say well
[56:34] no there's not no see argue over seven
[56:36] spirits where there seven no they might
[56:37] be six there might be five I don't know
[56:39] didn't argue argue
[56:42] argue there's not seven spirits it's the
[56:45] seven manifestations of the spirit of
[56:47] God in each age right that's right the
[56:52] same spirit of God amen not changing in
[56:56] the agees God never changed man
[57:01] changed and
[57:04] look and from Jesus
[57:07] Christ who is the faithful
[57:11] witness then you get over to Revelation
[57:13] 3:14 you know and he's the the witness
[57:17] you know right the beginning of the
[57:19] creation of God that's right
[57:22] look and the first begotten of the Dead
[57:25] now we know for sure who that is and the
[57:27] prince of the kings of the earth we know
[57:30] who that
[57:31] is unto him that loved us and washed us
[57:34] from our sins in his own blood
[57:37] amen now he
[57:40] inserts right in the middle of all of
[57:43] the showing the
[57:46] person and he shows you where that
[57:48] person is going to
[57:51] be
[57:53] right
[57:55] verse six is not a descriptive form of
[57:57] that this a descriptive form of where
[57:59] he's going to be and hath made us Kings
[58:01] and Priests unto God and his father to
[58:04] him be glory and Dominion forever then
[58:06] it jumps right back to
[58:08] him behold he cometh with clouds and
[58:11] never eyes shall see and they which
[58:13] pierced him all the kingdom then he says
[58:14] I am the Alpha and Omega I'm the
[58:16] beginning and the
[58:18] ending I'm the all and all and I want
[58:21] you to know
[58:23] that
[58:27] then you'll know John what to send to
[58:31] patmas you'll know what to
[58:34] say because you won't be trying to
[58:37] figure out anything you'll be writing
[58:39] down what I say
[58:43] right now it's always been amazing to
[58:46] me U I've never been around Pentecostal
[58:49] people that
[58:50] much but you know we listen to a lot of
[58:53] tapes and and we'll hear a lot of
[58:55] tongues and interpretation you know
[58:57] that's on the tapes and
[59:01] uh you
[59:03] know Peggy was asking me one day because
[59:07] see one person spoke the other person
[59:10] interpreted well the other second person
[59:12] just kept on going but see brother brand
[59:14] said it's got to be F phrases and
[59:16] everything the same and just keeps on
[59:19] going she said well well that person
[59:21] kept on going was that correct I said
[59:23] yeah
[59:25] because that brother brandham said they
[59:28] will enter into a
[59:32] prophecy and
[59:34] continue bringing their message but what
[59:38] I my point is
[59:41] this now um brother
[59:43] Lise all right now brother Luise can
[59:46] come up
[59:48] here all right come on we'll get him
[59:51] involved he likes to do that don't he
[59:54] okay come
[59:55] on all
[59:58] right and he can
[1:00:00] interpret into Spanish what I
[1:00:04] say all
[1:00:06] right now that's really good okay you
[1:00:09] get over here where they can hear you on
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:11] microphone I want you to tell them that
[1:00:14] I'm talking this I w't I am talking
[1:00:17] about the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:22] Christ and he said every word I
[1:00:25] said but would you mind saying every
[1:00:28] word I said for the past
[1:00:36] hour I don't understand that but he
[1:00:38] simply means that he can't do it
[1:00:40] whatever he
[1:00:42] said revelation of Jesus Christ right
[1:00:46] okay thank
[1:00:48] you my
[1:00:50] point
[1:00:52] right my point
[1:00:56] how can somebody speak in
[1:00:59] tongue and give 30 words just a short 30
[1:01:04] words and yet somebody in a few minutes
[1:01:07] will stand up and interpret that
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:16] now it's word for
[1:01:19] word how can you remember
[1:01:23] that The Interpreter brother brandom
[1:01:27] says hears in his own language right
[1:01:32] what the other person has spoken in
[1:01:35] their
[1:01:36] language but still how can you remember
[1:01:44] it you never thought like
[1:01:48] that how can that person remember for
[1:01:52] five minutes and come back and say the
[1:01:55] same thing that this other person said
[1:01:58] over
[1:02:00] here now brother Louise what he can
[1:02:03] handle the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:05] but he can't tell you what I said 10
[1:02:06] minutes
[1:02:08] ago
[1:02:09] why he's interpreting word for word
[1:02:15] right but what about the great Pro the
[1:02:18] great things that God can
[1:02:21] do when I hear a tongue and
[1:02:23] interpretation I listen
[1:02:24] come
[1:02:25] on I
[1:02:27] listen brother Rand sometimes he'll say
[1:02:31] say see there they Vindicated exactly
[1:02:33] what was going on or something like
[1:02:37] that but I sat there in
[1:02:40] amazement to
[1:02:42] realize that God could put that person's
[1:02:45] words from Spanish into English or
[1:02:48] whatever French into
[1:02:51] English and then I could tell you
[1:02:53] exactly what he said in in
[1:02:56] French and I could remember every word
[1:03:00] right you tell me that ain't
[1:03:05] God you do you get what I mean amen God
[1:03:09] can do wondrous
[1:03:11] things so he could tell John what to
[1:03:16] write all
[1:03:19] right and John maybe would get it in a
[1:03:23] Flash
[1:03:27] remember he's a
[1:03:28] prophet he goes and sits down as I said
[1:03:31] under a tree that's just an
[1:03:34] illustration and he starts to
[1:03:38] write and he writes what God told him
[1:03:41] the day before right you understand me
[1:03:49] amen you understand
[1:03:51] me Le of God
[1:03:56] write sit
[1:03:58] down and it'll be word for word what God
[1:04:01] had told him two days or three days
[1:04:06] before these ministers can illustrate it
[1:04:09] maybe better than I can but it it's
[1:04:13] different being a teacher than it is a
[1:04:17] and I don't mean difference in God now
[1:04:19] or anything but a teacher operates a
[1:04:21] little different than a say a uh an
[1:04:24] evangelist style or a or a pastor
[1:04:28] style or an apostle you know Prophet
[1:04:31] whatever there's there's different
[1:04:33] Ministries and uh see all I've got to do
[1:04:36] is get a
[1:04:38] thought brother Woodby used to tear him
[1:04:40] up we'd assign him a topic in the old
[1:04:42] ministers meeting days and and he go
[1:04:44] HeyWire he said don't do
[1:04:47] that I said just give me a topic I'll
[1:04:50] take it up next time we have a
[1:04:52] service he said but I'm not made at way
[1:04:54] I've got to get an unction right to go
[1:04:57] with it well see that's his ministry I'm
[1:05:00] not against that I'm trying to explain
[1:05:03] it John is sitting on patmas he's a
[1:05:07] prophet right cuz that's what brother
[1:05:09] Brown called him he's the prophetic one
[1:05:12] out of the four Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:05:14] John and John being there like he
[1:05:18] is God speaks to him and he just sits
[1:05:21] down and he starts write
[1:05:23] it
[1:05:24] I don't mean it to be exalted or be
[1:05:26] anything in the world you name a
[1:05:29] topic you name a topic for me to speak
[1:05:33] on and you give me a scripture or tell
[1:05:36] me to let it fall
[1:05:38] open and I can preach on that topic
[1:05:42] because that's the ministry that's
[1:05:47] there an evangelist he can't do that he
[1:05:50] has to have something to related and
[1:05:53] stirring up and and going so God chose
[1:05:57] John to be there to where he could tell
[1:06:01] him and tell him what to
[1:06:04] write but what about the great Apostle
[1:06:08] Paul in the apostleship in the uh height
[1:06:12] or whatever you want to call it or
[1:06:14] whatever office or what you're doing
[1:06:16] Paul was way above because I looking the
[1:06:19] quote yesterday or day before there
[1:06:21] where brother random was talking about
[1:06:22] said Paul had a greater revelation and
[1:06:24] all the
[1:06:28] others but yet Paul wasn't chose to
[1:06:32] explain the revelation of Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ on the aisle of
[1:06:38] patas right right he wasn't even chosen
[1:06:43] to write about you know this out of the
[1:06:45] other but John wasn't chosen to write
[1:06:47] about the
[1:06:49] communion where Paul could write about
[1:06:51] the
[1:06:53] communion it's all in the ministry wise
[1:06:55] of God the seven spirits of God down
[1:06:58] Through the Ages leading Mankind in what
[1:07:00] to
[1:07:01] do but my point is this brother Brown
[1:07:04] said we must get into the spirit of the
[1:07:09] author
[1:07:10] amen he said there's where trouble's at
[1:07:14] we don't get in the spirit of the
[1:07:16] author now watch what I'm saying he
[1:07:19] didn't say we don't get in the spirit of
[1:07:20] The Interpreter we don't get in the
[1:07:23] spirit of the person speaking he says we
[1:07:26] don't get in the spirit of the
[1:07:30] author lot of difference in all the
[1:07:32] others in the
[1:07:35] author when I get it like that from him
[1:07:38] I don't care who's against
[1:07:41] me i' invite the world it's out there
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:47] invited to come and show me where I'm
[1:07:51] wrong why because I'm not afraid of it
[1:07:55] amen cuz you see I know that he'll take
[1:07:59] care of it that's
[1:08:01] right see he chose the right one to go
[1:08:04] to patmas right the one man that would
[1:08:07] have the
[1:08:08] ministry that he could follow him and
[1:08:11] that he wouldn't get this and run off on
[1:08:13] it and get that and run off on it and
[1:08:15] grab something else and just run with
[1:08:17] it he knew he could tell him and he
[1:08:21] would write
[1:08:22] it
[1:08:25] and it would ever beit come out to be
[1:08:27] perfect
[1:08:30] then Paul could not be different than
[1:08:33] John
[1:08:35] right Peter wasn't different than John
[1:08:38] in Doctrine come on his behavior not
[1:08:43] Doctrine yet Peter said Paul says things
[1:08:46] hard to be understood that some wrestle
[1:08:48] to their own destruction you know he
[1:08:50] said at least I've learned not to
[1:08:51] wrestle with it that'd be the best way
[1:08:53] of interpreting what he saiding he
[1:08:55] learned to just
[1:08:59] wait but why can't the people wait on
[1:09:01] God to reveal
[1:09:05] it I believe there's a Bible talks about
[1:09:08] it called it a time to all things it
[1:09:10] doesn't say there's a time for all
[1:09:12] things it says there's a time to all
[1:09:14] things
[1:09:16] right well this is the time to
[1:09:20] understand what the prophet has brought
[1:09:22] unto us amen
[1:09:24] we don't have to go to
[1:09:26] patmas I remember years ago people would
[1:09:29] say have you been on the backside of
[1:09:33] desert said if you ain't been in quote
[1:09:36] brother R said no man has a right to be
[1:09:37] in a pull pit unless you been on the
[1:09:38] back side of the
[1:09:40] desert well okay we
[1:09:44] desert you know I mean where we going
[1:09:48] well then we'll do like the man up and
[1:09:49] turn Tennessee did that time he got him
[1:09:52] a bunch together and he got him some
[1:09:53] things and and I ain't talking about
[1:09:55] them guys that from off I'm talking
[1:09:56] about some people this messy and he had
[1:09:59] all this and boy they loaded up these
[1:10:00] guns and they got these hor of course he
[1:10:02] had the White
[1:10:03] Horse that was the thing nobody couldn't
[1:10:06] have a white horse but him and he boy he
[1:10:08] rode out there and he found these great
[1:10:16] Revelations but the same man looked at
[1:10:18] me one day and he
[1:10:20] said this is what he
[1:10:22] said
[1:10:24] he said you got it by
[1:10:26] Nature he said ' I went to school to
[1:10:28] learn what I
[1:10:30] got he said I'll swap with you any
[1:10:33] time said no
[1:10:35] way cuz see he
[1:10:38] thought the dick remember that when the
[1:10:40] guy had him to stand up and read and he
[1:10:42] to sat down nothing to do he punched me
[1:10:44] and he said he's been
[1:10:46] trained you see he thought I'd been
[1:10:49] trained then when I started speaking
[1:10:52] about the word that was with talking
[1:10:53] about then the ministry lined up with
[1:10:55] that and begin to you
[1:10:58] know you see it doesn't matter how much
[1:11:00] John went to patmas is my
[1:11:02] point there's got to be somebody to
[1:11:04] believe
[1:11:06] it like what do you mean we've had it
[1:11:09] for we've had it for 2,000 years now
[1:11:13] John wrote
[1:11:14] it
[1:11:16] amen but God wants somebody to believe
[1:11:19] it that's
[1:11:21] right and you know what he wants us to
[1:11:24] believe because how many times have I
[1:11:26] preached this to
[1:11:27] you that Jesus has never shown as I was
[1:11:30] saying a while ago anywhere in the Book
[1:11:32] of Revelations by himself that's right
[1:11:35] he's always shown with or in his
[1:11:41] people most of the time in his
[1:11:46] people so is this the revelation of
[1:11:48] Jesus Christ or Jesus the one Oneness
[1:11:51] form that you would bring that it would
[1:11:54] only reveal Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ then your
[1:12:00] Oneness if this message only reveals
[1:12:03] Jesus Christ your
[1:12:04] Oneness but if the bride is part of the
[1:12:08] mystery then there's not a Oneness end
[1:12:10] to it right that's right it's a true
[1:12:13] revelation of where he is and what he's
[1:12:18] doing it's the right
[1:12:22] understanding is seeing that the Book of
[1:12:25] Revelations is our book the book they
[1:12:27] told us to stay away
[1:12:29] from the one they told us we couldn't
[1:12:32] understand well you know what they was
[1:12:35] right right we couldn't understand
[1:12:40] it but God come down and brought a
[1:12:42] prophet yes sir
[1:12:45] Amen to bring us to Revelation not of
[1:12:49] himself that's an automatic process for
[1:12:52] it to be involved it's someone is trying
[1:12:54] to describe God to you you ought to have
[1:12:56] enough sense if he's describing it
[1:12:57] correctly
[1:12:59] listen if somebody's describing God to
[1:13:01] you and he's doing it correctly you
[1:13:03] ought to know how you ought to have
[1:13:04] enough sense to know who's talking
[1:13:08] right you order to be able to believe
[1:13:10] that as an interpreter can interpret and
[1:13:12] a guy can you know speak and another
[1:13:14] interpret 30 minutes later and give you
[1:13:16] the same wording that God can lead
[1:13:22] somebody
[1:13:24] did he can take a fivefold Ministry and
[1:13:26] take this message and carry it
[1:13:30] on if not what do we need them
[1:13:36] for
[1:13:37] right but you ever noticed that people
[1:13:40] that don't believe in the five4 ministry
[1:13:42] they never stopped being Pastor you ever
[1:13:44] seen one yet it did I want his
[1:13:48] name I'll call him and
[1:13:51] apologize I want his name name if he
[1:13:53] says it ain't no five full ministry so
[1:13:55] we don't take no tithe no more and I'm
[1:13:57] not the
[1:13:59] pastor I want his
[1:14:02] name because it ain't
[1:14:05] TI he's wanting it he gets the tith he's
[1:14:09] the one's doing all of
[1:14:11] it he don't believe in a four-fold
[1:14:13] Ministry why don't he say
[1:14:18] that he believes in
[1:14:22] himself
[1:14:25] but
[1:14:27] remember watch this the next message we
[1:14:30] get into or the one after when we get
[1:14:32] into that
[1:14:33] voice and a prophet would say that voice
[1:14:36] and the person is the
[1:14:46] same now what if that voice chooses to
[1:14:49] use
[1:14:52] uh
[1:14:54] when are you sisters to speak
[1:14:59] from no no there ain't no woman we're
[1:15:03] not talking about woman the
[1:15:06] pullit cuz you know how I preach it and
[1:15:10] how I believe it you're not going in
[1:15:13] because that your husband is going
[1:15:16] you're not going in because your wife is
[1:15:18] going you're going to go because you're
[1:15:21] an individual in the Body of Christ
[1:15:25] right depending on someone else yes
[1:15:28] that's
[1:15:29] wonderful but when that someone else
[1:15:31] comes between you and
[1:15:35] God you mind if I
[1:15:37] quote or the prophet would tell the
[1:15:40] sisters that you don't have to be in
[1:15:43] subjection to him if he's wrong to
[1:15:52] you
[1:15:53] you don't have to obey him when he's
[1:15:55] doing something wrong to
[1:16:00] you well okay all right that's okay with
[1:16:05] me but I'm to the point of one
[1:16:10] thing you talk to me about Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ and I don't know whether you're
[1:16:16] telling the truth or
[1:16:20] not and you bring that Christ right down
[1:16:22] into form and I'll shout with
[1:16:28] you but if you run Jesus out the door
[1:16:31] and you got the only the bride left I'm
[1:16:33] going to leave
[1:16:34] you and there won't be no shouting
[1:16:37] there'll be some hollering and
[1:16:42] screaming because that's where I
[1:16:47] stand if he's the author and finisher of
[1:16:50] our Salvation if he's the Alpha and the
[1:16:52] Omega if he's the beginning and the
[1:16:54] ending if he's Hebrews
[1:16:56] 13:8
[1:17:00] then why don't we depend upon
[1:17:07] him why don't we depend upon him and
[1:17:10] just say okay now
[1:17:12] Lord You've revealed yourself to us now
[1:17:16] you're trying in this last days to
[1:17:18] reveal where you're
[1:17:21] at you're no longer here in fleshly form
[1:17:24] as the body of
[1:17:26] Christ you know the poor mortal body Etc
[1:17:30] but you're here in The Bride of Jesus
[1:17:37] Christ and now you're revealing yourself
[1:17:40] where you're
[1:17:42] at what a rejoicing time it should
[1:17:46] be to comprehend that almighty God is
[1:17:49] trying to join himself so close to a
[1:17:51] human being
[1:17:54] until even David in the spirit would
[1:17:57] sing and say they pierce my hands and my
[1:18:04] feet right the same thing The Man
[1:18:08] Without two 3,000 years
[1:18:11] later hung on a
[1:18:15] tree he was in the first person brother
[1:18:19] Brandon makes a
[1:18:21] statement he said
[1:18:23] David spoke in the first person well you
[1:18:26] know what you do when you speak in the
[1:18:27] first person they ain't no second
[1:18:32] person right if it is you'd be speaking
[1:18:36] in the second person right they ain't no
[1:18:40] second person it's the same person
[1:18:43] speaking but the surprise is where he's
[1:18:49] from right and with brother dick
[1:18:53] favorite Paul on the road to
[1:18:55] Damascus smitten and
[1:18:58] down he understood the
[1:19:01] light he knew there was something
[1:19:04] Supernatural and he understood theight
[1:19:06] and and I'm quoting brother around he
[1:19:08] recognized that as the Old Testament and
[1:19:10] said he would not have called it
[1:19:12] anything else he said because he knew
[1:19:15] who that
[1:19:19] was but the surprise was when that voice
[1:19:21] spoke
[1:19:25] and it was really a surprise when he
[1:19:26] said I'm
[1:19:31] Jesus and Paul says oh Lord something's
[1:19:36] happening
[1:19:38] now help me Lord
[1:19:43] CU I didn't believe in
[1:19:46] you you know and you're saying that's
[1:19:49] who you are you're saying the one that
[1:19:51] was on the tree they was
[1:19:55] crucified he almighty God and I'm very
[1:19:59] find it because I realized who's
[1:20:01] speaking come on get the message of what
[1:20:03] brother Bram
[1:20:05] said he said Paul would not have called
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:09] Lord had he not known that that was the
[1:20:12] Jehovah of the Old
[1:20:18] Testament and that was a surprise when
[1:20:20] he said
[1:20:21] Jesus that was a
[1:20:24] surprise well Paul could say okay I'm
[1:20:27] doing pretty good cuz see I I never did
[1:20:30] you know I never did persecute Jesus
[1:20:34] yeah as a matter of fact so me and uh me
[1:20:38] and Kus and what was her name Nicodemus
[1:20:42] and gamea said me and Nicodemus and
[1:20:44] kameha said we talked a little bit about
[1:20:46] him and said I I I didn't get
[1:20:51] mad but he said said Paul you don't
[1:20:55] understand I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:21:00] persecutest thank you
[1:21:02] Jesus Paul Rod over there and his
[1:21:05] blinded eyes couldn't
[1:21:06] see but his eyes in his heart begin to
[1:21:10] open he knew he was on the way to kill
[1:21:13] those Christians that's
[1:21:15] right he then
[1:21:18] realized who they had been killing
[1:21:24] they had been killing Jesus that's right
[1:21:27] the same person just in a different
[1:21:31] form do we believe it that
[1:21:35] way do we treat one another as Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ
[1:21:50] on do we take the thing brother Brandon
[1:21:53] would say to
[1:21:55] us what about one like this he
[1:21:58] said what if God let that person say
[1:22:00] something to you to find out what you do
[1:22:03] we don't want to quote that and do
[1:22:05] we that's uh we we don't we we want to
[1:22:09] leave that and you know that was before
[1:22:12] the seals broke you know what I mean
[1:22:15] that's where the people of the message
[1:22:16] do
[1:22:20] things but what about it do you see
[1:22:23] what I'm trying to get at in the Book of
[1:22:27] Revelations that he's never revealed
[1:22:29] nowhere there by
[1:22:32] himself he's always revealed in somebody
[1:22:36] or with
[1:22:38] somebody you know and it's very rare
[1:22:40] that it's the with part most of the time
[1:22:43] it's the end
[1:22:47] part brother brand says chapter 1
[1:22:50] through three we'll pick these back
[1:22:54] up he said that is the
[1:22:58] church he said chapter 4 through 19 is
[1:23:05] Israel he says in chapter 19 through 22
[1:23:08] he said it's both of them
[1:23:12] together but yes we got it all how can
[1:23:15] it be Hey Brother D how can that be
[1:23:17] because Revelations
[1:23:21] 10:7
[1:23:23] I've had them throw at me that's until
[1:23:26] you get sick at your
[1:23:28] stomach to give people what brother
[1:23:30] brandham said one day he explained it
[1:23:32] and he said talking about you know
[1:23:34] Revelations 1 TR there and he he
[1:23:38] explains it and he says that's thus
[1:23:39] sayith the
[1:23:42] Lord and yet people are
[1:23:45] just but look at look at Revelation
[1:23:48] 10:7 I said look at it right
[1:23:53] right it's got to be to us it's got to
[1:23:55] be to
[1:23:57] Israel now what's your
[1:24:00] problem yeah but what about 184 where it
[1:24:03] says come out of her my people I said
[1:24:05] what about it Israel comes out of
[1:24:09] her it's a compound
[1:24:16] meaning but you see people don't want
[1:24:19] somebody that will stay with the
[1:24:22] scripture
[1:24:23] even to just quote
[1:24:25] them they want their
[1:24:28] ideas about what it
[1:24:31] says something they can live with come
[1:24:35] on
[1:24:36] Brothers but you see it's a revelation
[1:24:38] of Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ but the Book of
[1:24:42] Revelations is showing where Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ is
[1:24:48] at Matthew Mark Luke and John is a
[1:24:50] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:52] Genesis through Revelation is the
[1:24:55] revelation of Jesus Christ Paul is
[1:24:58] explaining the great mystery and even
[1:25:01] spraining explaining the bride and
[1:25:03] that's where the Prophet comes up with
[1:25:04] it and said the bride is part of the
[1:25:06] mystery and must be
[1:25:11] revealed but none of them brought it
[1:25:14] like it was given to John on
[1:25:19] patas and all we want to do is our argue
[1:25:22] about who was behind the tree and what I
[1:25:25] mean by that is one simple
[1:25:29] Point who done this and who done that
[1:25:34] well if we find out who done this and
[1:25:36] who done that where will it help
[1:25:40] who but we find out what it was
[1:25:44] saying and then let God reveal that
[1:25:48] amen then we can rejoice in these other
[1:25:52] things things will be made known when we
[1:25:54] need
[1:25:57] them I can go with you on the new name
[1:25:59] that's
[1:26:00] fine but I can go with you where the
[1:26:02] Prophet said what he said it'll be made
[1:26:05] known maybe when we get there so now you
[1:26:07] just start to give the two
[1:26:11] quotes yeah but this got to be a certain
[1:26:13] way it's got to be brother rand's mouth
[1:26:15] was formed a certain way to speak that
[1:26:19] word I
[1:26:21] didn't I'm just plain if that's true we
[1:26:24] need to get some good pictures of him
[1:26:25] and go have some
[1:26:28] operations
[1:26:30] right I mean is that
[1:26:32] aggravating is that me being hateful to
[1:26:35] say if he's it's got to be over like
[1:26:37] this then we everyone need to walk
[1:26:39] around and I'm not joking
[1:26:45] either I'm trying to say it like it is
[1:26:48] if that's all it is get an
[1:26:51] operation
[1:26:56] no that man's heart was what was made
[1:26:58] right where he could speak amen that
[1:27:01] soul of that
[1:27:03] man that could live so close to God
[1:27:06] until he could get an audience with
[1:27:12] God sure it would have been an amazing
[1:27:14] thing to walk with a man that could tell
[1:27:16] you how many fish he going to catch
[1:27:17] before you caught them how many deer you
[1:27:19] going to kill where they was at and
[1:27:20] whatever he told Brother John Martin one
[1:27:22] day brother John got sick and they was
[1:27:24] hunting he told Brother John he said if
[1:27:26] he didn't tell him where to go he said
[1:27:28] John and that's what John told me
[1:27:30] now he said brother Brown said now John
[1:27:34] you not feeling too good said if I was
[1:27:36] you I'd go right down here to this
[1:27:37] little creek or something you know went
[1:27:41] down there today he killed the biggest
[1:27:43] deer of the whole
[1:27:46] crowd I believe
[1:27:49] that I believe it happened
[1:27:55] but I believe he preached the revelation
[1:27:56] of Jesus Christ in its Purity to you and
[1:28:02] I there's my part that I enjoy let's
[1:28:06] stand 369 red book 369 in the red book

[1:28:11] need the Mighty God is Jesus the prince
[1:28:15] of peace is he the Everlasting father
[1:28:21] the king ET
[1:28:28] I
[1:28:29] believe same
[1:28:33] yesterday I believe in praying for the
[1:28:35] sick
[1:28:36] don't I believe he's the
[1:28:39] Healer I believe he's the
[1:28:45] Savior but it's just like I told Brother
[1:28:48] Gary it may sound like doubt but it's
[1:28:50] plain common sense
[1:28:52] I said Brother Gary we're talking today
[1:28:54] I
[1:28:55] said we can't make God do what we want
[1:28:58] him to
[1:28:59] do host
[1:29:03] the but I said we can
[1:29:06] say what he's already done the high
[1:29:09] priest the lamb for siners slain the Au

[1:29:27] who would want to do
[1:29:31] that wouldn't that be back there in the
[1:29:33] book of Acts where the man said give me
[1:29:35] power that I may be able to give to
[1:29:37] whoever I desire the holy
[1:29:41] ghost that sound like a good
[1:29:44] point they thought he thought they could
[1:29:48] just give
