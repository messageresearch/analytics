[0:00] all right we got everything taken care
[0:02] of now all right let's get on to Romans
[0:08] we were talking last week about the
[0:12] adoption so we had some oh there they
[0:20] are right there excuse me here now both
[0:24] :
[0:24] we're fighting you didn't mention
[0:30] they'll work I think they're missing
[0:34] their work today either excuse this man
[0:38] sir I got plenty they're always they
[0:46] bless this Maskull well bless this mess
[0:48] so Neil becomes their the seat of a
[0:51] family they call all children and Ivan
[0:53] shall thy seed be called
[0:54] we're talking about the adoption
[0:55] pertaining to Israel that is they once
[0:58] your children of the flesh these are not
[1:02] children of God but the children of the
[1:04] promise are counted for the seed all
[1:06] right so not all Israel Israel Israel
[1:10] natural is just as rotten as America
[1:15] natural or any other country natural
[1:17] have I got that right by now if you
[1:20] counted for the seed the state of the
[1:23] promise it's not seeds as of many but
[1:26] one seed which is Christ and that seed
[1:28] is the holding up for this is the word
[1:32] of promise at this time will I come and
[1:34] Sarah shall have a son then that's the
[1:36] promise and not only this but when
[1:38] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[1:41] by our Father Isaac for the children
[1:44] being not yet born neither having done
[1:46] any good or evil person according to
[1:48] election might stand not on works but of
[1:50] him the college now remember that was
[1:53] Jacob and Esau Jacob and Esau came from
[2:00] you would say good parents general Isaac
[2:05] and Rebekah but we know what he saw he
[2:08] and Esau sold his birthright and Jacob
[2:12] and as we see he many times in them
[2:15] think about this other day many times in
[2:17] the old tech you know it's the old
[2:18] testament he just take it without
[2:19] revelation then I would have picked a
[2:23] song better God took care of it all he
[2:27] took care of his daddy
[2:28] fed him clothed him everything is they
[2:32] did Jacob was underneath this moment's
[2:34] coattails what brother instead of her
[2:36] dressed up underneath the dress and a
[2:39] little boy so which one would you
[2:42] pick
[2:42] we the Big D saw we depict a lot of the
[2:46] ones in the in the Old Testament but
[2:49] without the Holy Ghost you can't discern
[2:50] that because we got to see today same
[2:53] things happening because Esau to me is
[2:56] the type of the anointed ones at the end
[3:02] time look good and everything was great
[3:05] he did everything he was supposed to do
[3:08] but he just couldn't come to that place
[3:11] to where he really wanted that number
[3:13] one birthright he really didn't care
[3:14] whether that happened to him or not see
[3:17] you're not our birthright it's the
[3:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost right so
[3:21] that's our birthright that is the claim
[3:23] with Jacob learned it more nice obvious
[3:27] all right so he's he's interpolating
[3:29] here but children be not yet born
[3:32] neither haven't done any good or evil
[3:36] obviously before you born you can't be
[3:38] good or evil but when you come into this
[3:41] world you have a choice
[3:42] God knew your choice they're there for
[3:45] Jacob have my love then he saw have I
[3:47] hated
[3:47] according to what foreknowledge right
[3:51] God for a knew what he saw would do he
[3:54] foreknew what Jacob was going to do nice
[3:58] thing about this of the day why doesn't
[3:59] God I've told you all that Sunday why
[4:01] doesn't God step in he knows what's
[4:04] gonna happen why don't he just he can't
[4:08] cuz then he would be making you do
[4:10] something he can't step in now he can
[4:13] step in according to your faith and
[4:15] according to them
[4:17] that you do according to the word but he
[4:19] can't step in and change he couldn't
[4:22] change the song so therefore he could
[4:27] write Jacob have I loved before him was
[4:29] born the same way with you and I if you
[4:33] take this thing let me just vanilla this
[4:35] thing you and I were chosen of God
[4:38] because of foreknowledge not chosen with
[4:40] God because of any other thing he looked
[4:44] down through times so what you would
[4:45] accept to what you would reject there
[4:48] for us all left up to you okay
[4:50] so therefore he could take a piece of
[4:53] the word the seed and put it somewhere
[4:55] but not inside of you like people and
[4:57] for into message preached you can't have
[4:59] you turn a life in a sinful body enters
[5:02] enter person in inner person the other
[5:07] person this thing still was born in sin
[5:08] but you understand what I'm saying once
[5:10] you're born again though like we've been
[5:12] trying to show upstairs now that you're
[5:14] born again this guy right here has a
[5:17] straight line to be glorified it's just
[5:21] gonna happen because what's on the
[5:23] inside but God knew Jacob would continue
[5:26] on
[5:26] Esau would not so there's your
[5:29] predestination by foreknowledge
[5:31] right cuz he couldn't put these all
[5:33] right here in this the art he saw this
[5:34] is what you're gonna do
[5:35] no he saw what he saw we didn't
[5:38] therefore he could come back and
[5:40] predestinate what shall we say then look
[5:45] is there unrighteousness with God in
[5:48] other words did he make it did he hate
[5:50] Esau because of what he wanted he
[5:53] soldered a nobody hated Esau because
[5:55] like Esau did God forbid for he said to
[6:01] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[6:03] have mercy I will have compassion on
[6:05] whom I will have compassion so then it's
[6:08] not of him that willeth nor of him that
[6:10] runneth but of God that shows mercy know
[6:12] what is the mercy of God that's the
[6:15] grace of God now what's grace for grace
[6:17] for is four things you're gonna do know
[6:20] what you did before
[6:25] you can't ask forgiveness and then go do
[6:27] it that's what the Catholics do they go
[6:29] in and you know forgive me father I'm
[6:31] gonna go murder somebody well your
[6:32] forgive them go on no you can do that
[6:35] no so it's not him that will it nor him
[6:41] that run it but of God that shows mercy
[6:45] because remember the scripture tells us
[6:48] that God is not willing for anybody to
[6:51] perish you know where he came to this
[6:52] earth literally to die for every person
[6:55] but he knew everyone that would and
[6:57] everyone do it but he did it anyway
[6:59] because you can't stand on the day of
[7:02] judgment and say okay these guys right
[7:04] here I come to get them because they're
[7:07] special
[7:09] no I come to get them because I they
[7:12] accepted me you did that's the
[7:15] difference he said no laundry list of
[7:17] how many people you killed it's just you
[7:19] rejected Christ all right bad God showed
[7:23] mercy and there is mercy for the ones
[7:26] he's going to give a cup of water of my
[7:27] name he'll have to excuse me today well
[7:33] even the when we start going like this
[7:36] fifth seal man what you talking about
[7:38] grace to the nth degree we're gonna see
[7:42] that with the with the fifth seal you
[7:44] because God had to show mercy on them
[7:46] because he made them black he blinded
[7:51] them so it's his fault
[7:53] therefore he makes a judgment for that
[7:56] he gives them eternal life get on that
[7:59] rope but I even give a white robes here
[8:01] you give them a white robe laughter
[8:03] they've already passed on well that's
[8:06] really lovely to know that this fifth
[8:08] seal we're going into another dimension
[8:12] no way did he he blind also the ones
[8:15] that actually took
[8:17] of the crucifixion they glided along he
[8:20] blooded all of Israel right I know so so
[8:23] did those get eternal life like the
[8:25] Sanhedrin at that time and all that
[8:27] could if they didn't do like office a
[8:30] conference made his choice right tapas
[8:33] is one and said let's kill him all right
[8:36] but now remember and we'll get into the
[8:37] fifth seal what brother ground talks
[8:38] about let his blood be on us and our
[8:41] children and we'll see that all down
[8:43] through the two thousand years look tell
[8:45] me if it was even now many Israel is
[8:48] being persecuted and without the help of
[8:49] the United States and well God helping
[8:55] them they'd be destroyed in the local
[8:57] country not much bigger than Rhode
[8:58] Island compared to America you know a
[9:02] little beauty country with just several
[9:03] million people yet the whole world
[9:06] worries about Israel while they do that
[9:10] well they know there's something
[9:11] supernatural about them and there is
[9:12] something supernatural is when a
[9:15] scripture said unto Pharaoh even from
[9:17] this same purpose have I raised the up
[9:19] that I might show my power in thee is
[9:22] that my name might be declared on all
[9:24] the earth now what did he do I'm
[9:28] sweating Joss's phrases don't a fire
[9:32] over there yeah Jim sweating and I'm wet
[9:36] so but hopefully it's that demon getting
[9:41] out of devil leaveth
[9:46] you okay out there okay if you get too
[9:50] cold just stand up and start doing some
[9:53] kind of stance or something now look
[9:56] done didn't make Pharaoh do what he did
[9:58] the Bible says God hardened Pharaoh's
[9:59] heart you know what God did God put
[10:02] something before Pharaoh so he can make
[10:04] a choice he didn't make the choice for
[10:07] Pharaoh he put something before Pharaoh
[10:11] and Pharaohs it now you know them do
[10:13] that all right because God didn't put in
[10:16] dick whispering Pharaoh there and a
[10:18] pharaoh I'm done no he didn't do they
[10:20] can't do that he's not a respecter of
[10:23] persons just I mean you he'll weigh
[10:25] something before us to see what we'll do
[10:28] about it
[10:29] knowing what we're going to do with it
[10:31] at the moment
[10:32] yeah but it's a journey time it's a time
[10:36] of of I say judgment of us you know
[10:40] everything being judged all right so
[10:44] very sad to Moses I will have mercy
[10:47] but women Pharaoh even for this same
[10:49] purpose how am i raised in that I might
[10:52] show my power in thee and that my name
[10:54] might be declared throughout all the
[10:56] earth therefore happy mercy on whom he
[10:59] will have mercy and whom he will
[11:02] hardness because the Bible says God
[11:06] hardened Pharaoh's heart
[11:07] God gave Pharaoh a choice right right
[11:14] yes and he didn't say I won't give you a
[11:18] choice but you need to tell Moses he
[11:20] can't go nobody can do that
[11:22] yeah I can't do that yeah he's a respect
[11:25] your personal if he did he just like I
[11:27] said he laid the plan before Pharaoh and
[11:29] fellowship huh this is what I'm gonna do
[11:31] I think that will say then unto me why
[11:38] does he get fined fall for who has
[11:41] resisted his will
[11:42] nay but o man he gained but o man who
[11:52] art thou that replies against God get
[11:55] the same form say to him that formed it
[11:57] why hast thou made me that's you can't
[12:01] do that now most people are gonna take
[12:03] this and say well this is that line
[12:06] you're talking about brother dick we
[12:08] can't do nothing but that line because
[12:10] the Potter has power over the clay it
[12:16] make one vessel unto honour and another
[12:18] unto dishonour but for knowledge he can
[12:22] do that cuz it's not then you've got to
[12:27] but listen who and look come on the day
[12:30] of judgment morning what are they gonna
[12:31] say you made me this way no he's gonna
[12:36] say no I didn't mean I'll let you come
[12:38] here for you to make a choice
[12:41] and this is the choice you make and the
[12:45] choice you made
[12:46] it's the judgment cause remember we
[12:48] judge ourselves time God like to plan
[12:52] out we judge ourselves okay after Farrah
[13:00] made the decision I had the choice
[13:03] Pharaoh had the choice God he couldn't
[13:06] turn back turn back just to be able to
[13:13] turn back
[13:13] nothing that's what I mean he was given
[13:16] the choice because Pharaoh said all
[13:19] right Moses go on in at the moment he
[13:23] said the end moments go ahead then what
[13:25] happen later God gets what I'm saying
[13:27] though God didn't come to Moses I mean
[13:29] come to Pharaon sit down and go now if
[13:31] you let them go this is what's gonna
[13:34] happen this was gonna miss them that's
[13:36] him telling him what to do he left
[13:40] Pharaoh in his own life his own spirit
[13:44] realm say hey I made a boo-boo
[13:47] I did something I finally didn't go I
[13:49] got nobody to cut my cut my grass and do
[13:53] my flowers you know what I mean in the
[13:54] modern time right I think I'm ready to
[13:56] do well how am I gonna build these big
[13:58] buildings without all these Israelites
[14:01] and then that's when God hardened his
[14:04] heart cuz the new Pharaoh would never
[14:05] turn back
[14:07] yeah and I'm telling you it this will
[14:10] help you with predestination in
[14:12] foreknowledge brother Branham said one
[14:16] time and I'm paraphrasing
[14:19] God knew if he gives Pharaoh a million
[14:24] years to change his mind he never would
[14:26] if he gave Adolf Hitler ten million
[14:28] years to change his mind he never would
[14:30] so therefore he could judge him by what
[14:35] he did because he knew he'd never
[14:37] changed his mind
[14:38] see that's so sad with people that's why
[14:42] God hardened Pharaoh's heart didn't you
[14:44] never turn around by decode the other
[14:46] way
[14:46] right he knew that he would call these
[14:50] home plagues down on himself and all
[14:52] those things like that have not the
[14:55] Potter power over the clay of the same
[14:58] lump to make one vessel unto honor under
[15:00] dishonor that looks like God met a
[15:02] choice he made that choice because of
[15:04] you what if God willing to show his
[15:08] wrath and to make his power known
[15:10] endured with much long-suffering the
[15:13] vessels of Wrath did say madam he
[15:17] endured with them why he'd give them
[15:21] time to repent every person that ever
[15:24] will come to the wife of judgment he
[15:26] give them a space of time to repent now
[15:30] you remember the girl that that was
[15:33] supposed to die and burn the rounds
[15:36] girls supposed to die God literally off
[15:40] then about six months later everybody
[15:43] pronounced her healed and all that stuff
[15:44] and she says mom I'm going home I read
[15:46] it the other day yes you like the ground
[15:52] the first time this one was and and she
[15:55] they got her back a lot but then we come
[15:56] to the end six more months later we're
[16:00] brother branham they pray for and
[16:03] remember somebody pronounced they want
[16:05] you into another place they pronounced
[16:06] Radel brother Ram Singh no no that's no
[16:12] what happened where the random
[16:13] pronounced or heal that's words thank
[16:16] God he said God you owe me an
[16:17] explanation that's right I'm done he
[16:19] said he said God let me steal on that
[16:22] for about three months
[16:23] nobody three months it's a long time but
[16:27] when God came to and God came to him and
[16:29] said look I should have took her when
[16:33] she drowned but I gave her six more
[16:35] months to get right with God we'll see
[16:38] that was God's mercy knowing that she
[16:40] would do that now if she had never done
[16:42] that he would have
[16:43] in swimming pool remembers you with that
[16:46] unite am I understand that so God is not
[16:50] a respecter person God can't make you do
[16:52] something that you don't want to do
[16:55] that's the sovereign that's the
[16:58] sovereignty of you
[16:59] that's why brother Branham said that you
[17:02] are pretty much a deity yourself your
[17:08] God Bob said to your gods
[17:11] you are a God because you can you can
[17:14] pass judgment on yourself or not yes
[17:16] seek the mercy of God it'll save you
[17:19] that's how close to this cuz man look at
[17:22] Adam here's Adam a son a gun that can
[17:28] move trees move the world move
[17:30] everything herb things on the world
[17:34] speak to me to the storm or whatever nut
[17:37] storm and speak to the wind and all this
[17:39] thing and all of a sudden one day he
[17:42] takes one of eight did / took nobody
[17:47] shouldn't have done it to me I could
[17:49] kill hope up and started over again
[17:51] that's not God God presented it to Adam
[17:55] and Adam doesn't what he took he
[17:56] presented the aive Eve took what she
[17:58] took that was the choice brother Brian
[18:01] said it was free moral agency then it's
[18:03] free money to see now god never done
[18:05] away with free moral agency and what is
[18:07] free moral agency it's what for you to
[18:10] choose which way you gotta go
[18:17] so God knowing we'll get into this with
[18:20] it in the fifth seal God willing willing
[18:24] to show his wrath and to make his power
[18:25] known endured with much long-suffering
[18:27] the vessels of Wrath fitted to
[18:29] destruction
[18:30] he knew what they'd off Hitler was gonna
[18:32] do but those six million Jews they ain't
[18:34] off Hitler killed God's gonna give them
[18:36] eternal life give them a white robe cuz
[18:40] they're part of that blinded group
[18:44] because they died for the testimony they
[18:46] held up the testimony of Jesus Christ
[18:48] we'll get into all that the fifth sale
[18:50] but the testimony they held what was
[18:52] their only testimony
[18:53] we're Jews
[18:54] right where did so he was lung suffering
[18:59] just to show his seat to show his apex
[19:04] of grapes he had to let health ever do
[19:06] what he did the Enderlin I couldn't do
[19:07] what he did he had to let all the people
[19:09] that persecuted the Jews down through
[19:11] the ages do what they did to show his
[19:17] power to show us mercy to me the shores
[19:20] mercy so all contracts brother Brown
[19:23] speaks many times a contrast you have to
[19:25] have dark to make to appreciate life you
[19:28] have to have sinned appreciate you
[19:30] getting getting saved if not then you
[19:32] just go continue on just like your honor
[19:35] then he might make known the riches of
[19:37] his glory on the vessels of mercy so
[19:39] what's he doing all that this raft
[19:43] fitted to destruction that he might make
[19:46] known the reason to blur on the best of
[19:47] the mercy we can say today God's had
[19:49] mercy on us we accepted his mercy
[19:54] therefore we come under his mercy
[19:57] therefore we come under his grace we she
[20:00] had a for foreknowledge prepared unto
[20:04] glory even the last know what Paul even
[20:08] us whom he hath called not of the Jews
[20:11] only but also of the Gentile as he said
[20:14] in a sane or as a ax I will call them my
[20:19] people which were not my people check
[20:22] out and her beloved which was not
[20:27] beloved remember brother Brown said we
[20:30] weren't even looking for the Messiah
[20:31] we're not looking from the side we were
[20:34] looking for none of that all right my
[20:37] beekeepers chatted in okay and I it
[20:40] shall come to pass that in the place
[20:42] where it was said unto them you're not
[20:44] my people
[20:45] there shall they be called the children
[20:47] of the Living God didn't have we are now
[20:51] the children of God right yes how great
[20:55] is that that's where you see Paul has
[20:57] went from the Jews over to the Gentiles
[21:00] to take out that two thousand years in
[21:02] the dam seventy weeks that two thousand
[21:04] years of of Gentile age
[21:08] seven Church ages sorry then what's he
[21:11] gonna do he's going to come right back
[21:12] into the talking to the Jews Isaiah also
[21:19] cried concerning Israel though the
[21:21] number of the children of Israel be as
[21:23] the sand of the sea a remnant shall be
[21:25] saved if a remnant going to be saying
[21:28] we'll get into the rim with a little bit
[21:29] later because you got talking about the
[21:30] remnant in the fifth seal for he will
[21:33] finish the work and cut it short in
[21:35] righteousness because the short work
[21:38] will the Lord make upon the earth number
[21:41] that work that word work is what brother
[21:43] they've been talking about it's
[21:44] translated as word a short word you say
[21:48] short word well ours has been real sharp
[21:52] but 2,000 years in the schema of the
[21:55] earth it's nothing very short all right
[22:00] but he's not going there's no moon just
[22:03] cut it short he's gonna cut it short in
[22:05] righteousness a group of people is gonna
[22:07] realize what's going on take the word
[22:11] and we're gonna get out of here and
[22:13] inconsequent deal with the Jews because
[22:14] they can't deal with is using us at the
[22:16] same time and I was a said before he
[22:21] said the lord of sabbath had left us a
[22:23] seed we had been in sodom and been made
[22:27] like Gomorrah
[22:28] what's he saying if there had been a
[22:31] seed in that two thousand years when
[22:33] Israel rejected God he coulda ended the
[22:37] world right there he could have because
[22:40] his chosen people rejected it but
[22:45] there's a remnant there's a wild olive
[22:47] branch to have you come in the Gentile
[22:49] bride
[22:50] because remember Sodom and Gomorrah
[22:52] destroyed everything except for
[22:55] lightness two dollars
[22:57] well it's why but she didn't make it all
[23:00] the way out
[23:01] what shall we say then here's this whole
[23:03] summation what shall we say then that
[23:08] the Gentiles which followed not after
[23:11] righteousness in other words right up
[23:14] here at the top he's talking about the
[23:16] Jews had the adoption they had the law
[23:18] they had the Torah they had all the
[23:21] promises they had all these things
[23:24] Gentiles didn't have nothing there were
[23:26] dogs they were to be destroyed all of
[23:28] them i'ts in the Old Testament they were
[23:31] Gentiles all those like Hittites
[23:35] all right Jay besides and then we find
[23:38] websites call the night why shall we say
[23:44] then that the Gentiles whose father not
[23:47] after righteousness have obtained to
[23:49] righteousness even the righteousness
[23:51] which is of faith because really that's
[23:56] why Jesus in his in his mind I'm gonna
[24:00] step into the mind of God from the mouth
[24:02] of Jesus Jesus is sitting there walking
[24:04] through these people they're always
[24:06] needing a son they're always needing a
[24:09] prophecy they're always needing to throw
[24:11] something on them they're always needing
[24:13] their hands laid on Jarius coming lay
[24:16] hands on my child but he talks to a
[24:18] Gentile one day and a Gentile says he's
[24:22] gotta come in you're a man of authority
[24:25] I'm a man of authority I say go I sneak
[24:29] up you know the words he said you say go
[24:31] Damon you say come Damon in other words
[24:34] he knew Jesus had some kind of power
[24:35] they didn't need a connection he said I
[24:41] found a little greater faith in Israel
[24:43] then even the ceremony Chien woman what
[24:48] an example she sits on her David have
[24:51] mercy never paid her any attention yeah
[24:53] ain't no right only she did my lord see
[24:57] that coming Gentile fusion everybody
[24:58] else he turned and he said why do I need
[25:01] to get no words why am I giving you the
[25:04] Old Testament promises when you're a dog
[25:09] your gender
[25:10] you have no lineage you have no nothing
[25:13] she said yes Lord but we'll just take
[25:16] the crumbs they coming off the match
[25:17] September 1 in in Jesus's mind he's like
[25:20] man I I've never seen this kind of faith
[25:24] and what was it all everyone I was
[25:26] Gentile did ever that happen to so
[25:29] that's why God wanted they obtain
[25:32] righteousness by faith
[25:33] the Jews were laying back on when we got
[25:36] the Torah we've got the Ten Commandments
[25:38] we've got the promises we've got though
[25:40] we've got the we've got done that's why
[25:42] Jesus said yeah you got all that and I
[25:44] sent prophets to tell you that and you
[25:46] kill them yeah and now you paint their
[25:49] tunes and say oh oh oh poor lies there
[25:52] when I was able as a young boy with the
[25:54] Prophet they cut him in pieces and
[25:56] barity kill me because of what he's
[26:01] saying I'll say within that the Gentiles
[26:06] which followed not after righteousness
[26:07] have attained to righteousness even the
[26:10] righteousness which is the faith baby
[26:13] israel c which followed after the law of
[26:16] righteousness hath not attained to the
[26:19] law of righteousness they're still in
[26:21] the Old Testament they're still in the
[26:22] Torah they're still looking for on the
[26:23] side where for question mark because
[26:29] they sought it not by faith that's just
[26:33] the whole thing they started not by
[26:34] faith but as it were by the works of
[26:38] what the law go right back to the law
[26:42] for they stumbled at that
[26:44] stumbling-stone as in the straight and
[26:46] behold their lands on a stumbling stone
[26:49] on a rock of offense and whosoever
[26:51] believeth on him shall not be ashamed so
[26:55] they sent God sent the stone to
[26:58] Revelation God sent the man King himself
[27:02] to his people walked in the temple
[27:07] talked with him try to convince them
[27:10] trying to preach to him tell them who he
[27:12] was and they stumbled right over the
[27:16] very man that was standing there they
[27:18] stumbled all over him and called him
[27:21] everything but the
[27:21] thing but he was given it but look it
[27:25] was prophesied already he's gonna come
[27:29] design a stumbling stone a rock of
[27:31] offense why they hated him that you
[27:33] hated Jesus
[27:34] and here's never believeth on him shall
[27:37] not be ashamed
[27:41] now watch policy if you just for a
[27:44] second we'll we'll go upstairs I'd save
[27:47] my voice from the snatching their
[27:48] brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[27:51] God for Israel is that they might be
[27:54] saved
[27:56] cuz poke her up with all events from
[27:59] John Paul was a Jew he grew up in the
[28:02] temple with Victoria and with them the
[28:05] law and with them but when he received
[28:09] the Holy Ghost he's like man in other
[28:15] words you know what he's saying
[28:16] why can't y'all see this he said why
[28:19] can't you see this and I'm sure the Lord
[28:22] told him only by the Holy Ghost are you
[28:25] gonna see this that's why he said lo I
[28:27] turn to the Gentiles go to Gentiles to
[28:29] get my baby you and I have to take
[28:32] everything we believe by faith we never
[28:34] saw brother Branham but we know he was
[28:35] there
[28:36] we never saw Jesus Christ we never saw
[28:37] Paula Irenaeus Martin ollie
[28:39] we never saw George all by faith and if
[28:44] it's listen I said let me convince the
[28:45] other day it is hearsay until you until
[28:51] it is a revelation it's all hearsay
[28:54] until it's a revelation when it comes to
[28:56] revelation it's not hearsay anymore
[28:58] you're what you have agrees with what's
[29:02] being said and that's a revelation other
[29:05] than that is hearsay yeah and you can't
[29:08] have hearsay in a court of law
[29:10] you only have a way of true witness it's
[29:13] why the Bible says in Revelations 3:14
[29:16] the faithful and true witness the
[29:18] beginning the creation of God you and I
[29:21] are the true witness that Christ was
[29:24] here because he said he'd come back
[29:26] he said he'd live inside you brown bear
[29:28] them record that they have a zeal of God
[29:31] hey you will find a very devout
[29:33] than the Orthodox use over there right
[29:35] now they live that torch of the law they
[29:38] live that loss of the law yes but what's
[29:41] he doing them it's not bringing Christ
[29:45] to them that's for sure the only way
[29:47] they're gonna get crises when he comes
[29:49] to us and takes us out of here then he's
[29:50] gonna go to them by the promise in the
[29:53] Bible from bear the record the tamaseel'
[29:57] of God but not according to knowledge
[29:59] for they being ignorant of God's
[30:01] righteousness and going about to
[30:04] establish their own righteousness we be
[30:07] Abraham's seed we have Moses I've always
[30:11] said on countless walk them one day just
[30:13] like we did
[30:13] he walked them he said I got Moses go
[30:21] and they didn't have a clue what Moses
[30:24] don't that we walk around saying like
[30:26] out of quote I got a brother Brown quote
[30:29] well if you don't know that's not reveal
[30:33] to you then it's just a quote
[30:34] it's hearsay what does it mean when it
[30:37] says they they have a zeal of God and I
[30:40] would think that that would be with
[30:43] no they have a zeal of God would not
[30:45] according to knowledge holy ghost
[30:50] knowledge Holy Ghost revelation
[30:53] knowledge they have a knowledge of the
[30:55] truth but not according to knowledge you
[30:57] got to see that that's a two-fold
[30:59] meaning ceiling says look for I bear
[31:02] them record that they have a zeal of God
[31:04] , but not according to knowledge he
[31:08] can't be that they don't know what the
[31:10] Torah is the Lincoln reciting
[31:12] word-for-word it's right it's the
[31:16] knowledge that God's already come God
[31:19] was Jesus Christ he's already come he's
[31:22] already Donald come they don't have that
[31:24] knowledge they still think he's coming
[31:25] now they got a knowledge of he's coming
[31:27] oh yeah and they know I come pretending
[31:31] many times before they know what I just
[31:33] got to be here before he can come they
[31:36] just didn't get the forthcoming on the
[31:38] life that they're looking to the fifth
[31:39] coming up Elijah you battle right with
[31:42] that cuz every year that Elijah cup sits
[31:46] on their table and they're waiting on
[31:50] the lies you become and sit down to that
[31:53] table take that cup and drinking and
[31:56] then go messiahs coming yeah cuz they
[31:58] literally go outside their door
[31:59] tradition see there they have a
[32:01] knowledge tradition they open the door
[32:03] they look down the street this win this
[32:05] way they close the door they take the
[32:07] cup set it upon them um shelf and say
[32:12] until next year whatever that is in the
[32:14] Hebrew tongue until next year because
[32:17] they know their lives you've got to come
[32:19] before the grain breads then the Lord
[32:22] they know last mile come forward to them
[32:25] you extend to them that's Malachi 4 but
[32:29] when the two prophets go to Israel and
[32:32] start preaching that Malachi 4 is the
[32:36] fourth coming up Elijah and they missed
[32:38] it and here's his message they're gonna
[32:41] say oh man and then I'm gonna see
[32:42] William Brown they will see Jesus Christ
[32:44] Kalista message is not William Brown
[32:47] this message
[32:47] you struck down all right for they being
[32:54] ignorant of God's righteousness what's
[32:57] God's righteousness he came to her to
[32:59] save him then they turned him down and
[33:02] going about to establish their own
[33:04] righteousness like I said we got Moses
[33:06] you know we wait Abraham's our Father
[33:08] when he talked front at home he said
[33:10] you'd understood Abraham you'd
[33:12] understood me have not submitted
[33:14] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[33:17] they cook right here's your answer
[33:20] for Christ is the end of the law for
[33:22] righteousness to everyone that could be
[33:26] the lead bit all right let's go
[33:31] [Music]
