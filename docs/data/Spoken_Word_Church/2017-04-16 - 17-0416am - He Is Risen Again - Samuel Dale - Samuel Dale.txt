welcome stay with us and we'll have a good time eating together and fellowshipping all right let's do that okay let's pray father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and we thank you for everything and we just ask you to help us and guide us because we know that we're in an hour of time when things are being hustled and bustled all around the world and things are running Haywire every way we'd call it I guess cuz we're down at the end time but we just ask you to help us to get ourselves out of the way and to walk in the light of your grace and Lord that we may all see you living among us because that is the Easter's Resurrection time is to be that to Lord we don't put that much emphasis so much sometimes on the the times and all but because we believe in the resurrection all year round through Jesus Christ Our Lord but there is a time that we celebrate the Easter Resurrection so we ask you to just come now today and and raise in the hearts and lives of mankind because you did back there and now we expect it to be in our hearts and our lives and to know that he is risen again in us and living in US Lord you had a Resurrection yourself and then there's a resurrection for you for us Lord that we could rest in you forgive our sins and guide us and keep us in Jesus name amen now I want to read the entire chapter of Mark because we'll get back to it in a minute to where that it shows from the resurrection all the way in to the end time all right I'm not just one I don't generally do that I don't generally preach a uh service or something on Easter you know uh I Don't Preach like a Christmas message I I just whatever the Lord gives me I try to bring it and you know if it fits together on the time okay so this one just fits right into the to where we're at okay let's read and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Sly had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the suppl at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the suppl and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the seure they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were afed and he sath unto them Be not Afraid words don't be afraid you see Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here Behold a place where they laid him but go your way tell the disci his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him as he said unto you see he had told him what would take place but they just didn't remember it and didn't want to hold on right and they went out quickly and fled from the supp here for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared unto Mary Magdalene and out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not see because it's hard to believe something it's just somebody else talking about it but when it's personal to you now that changes things right after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they said at meat and upgraded them with their un belief and Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and they went forth preaching everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said I'm not I Don't Preach a message that you know basically when it comes say like uh the baby in the manger and all of that that's fine I don't you know the the the birth of a child if it falls out I preach maybe that in July August or September whatever the Lord gives me it doesn't matter because I'm not trying to emphasize that as much as I'm trying to emphasize a point or a thought for you and I now as we read about the disciples even some of them was there and if you'll take the other writings of the gospels you got four accounts and and you you got a lot of trouble sometimes putting this one into this one to that one to know which one you know is uh what's taking place you know to put them together cuz one will give one account this account of the two on the road to EMAs is pretty well over I think it's in Luke and it goes a pretty good place over into the day and getting into the end of the day uh of the day of the Resurrection but my point is that do we really believe he has risen now it doesn't say he has risen now the Bible is specific in the way that it says things right it doesn't say he has risen because that would be a p last time or a situation all right when you say he has that would mean and we would believe that he has risen all right but that's not the point it it's always he is risen see is is present tense because if you don't have an experience of Jesus Christ into your soul as the new birth then you don't really know that he he is risen you may be saying he has risen or was risen or could raise but you're you won't be saying he has risen unless you have something personal yourself that's why I want to get into that in a minute as we get down further in the message see I believe that there's proof of the Resurrection all right I believe that to be uh human beings we would be uh I don't like to use the word idiots or dumb or whatever but I guess it's a good point to not believe that there is a God you know because we' look at the world and see it we know we come from somewhere so then we'd have to have something to bring us here so whatever you'd have to still carry it back to find out there is a God to uh bring into mankind by man kind being here is the proof that there is or exist of a God uh you know not just a God but the God because we don't believe in many we believe in one true and living God all right but we know for a certain see we have proof Beyond any shadow of a doubt if you're a human mortal with a tiny bit of a brain it doesn't take a educated doing because most of the time education makes you an idiot because you go the wrong way with it all right but when you got just enough education to be able to understand right you know all right the in that then you can go to the Simplicity as I said then you can look around and say well we know surely there would be nobody you you say well there's people out here that are atheist I don't like that word atheist because how would it be that a person could stand here and stand on the earth as a human being and his heart beating and all of the things happening and not believe in the existence of a God to Creator to bring into being it would have to be from somewhere now you can argue whether this doctrine's right or that doctrine's right or who's right here whatever you know Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholics or whatever you can argue who's got the thoughts of what's right that has nothing to do with it it has nothing to do that proves it to me because it proves that there are mankind with a brain capable of thinking about something or a situation so it doesn't matter how much how many more doctrines you've got that alone is proof that God does exist because it it means to mankind that's reason the animal the animal can't think you know the dog the cat you think well my little dog it's it's a pretty little dog it can talk yeah you can teach a bird to talk but you better to be careful what you say it might do some talking to let everybody know what you've been talking about it might say some of your words uh had an cousin that she was bad to say a certain thing well you could walk in that house and that old parakeet he let her out well you know who it was it was talking it was her all right but now listen we know that there is a God we would have to agree with that there's proof that there is a God without any uh thoughts or ideas you say well well prove to me that there's a God is your heart beaten right well a dog's heart's beaten that's right cuz God gave him thaten right you know where would you be how would you be alive if it was not a Creator are you the Creator see that's what I've always said I don't believe in in in U atheists I believe that there's a lot of idiots because really if you're an atheist and don't believe in God you're you have to be believing that you're Superior amen because you're Superior to everybody else in the world that thans about a God so you're Superior so what are you trying to do make yourself God that solves that and that's Satan's idea just developed into mankind all right but now listen I said we've we I read the entire 16th chapter because it covers the Resurrection the events that took place proof that those things took place by people seeing him after he raised all right the Bible said he was seen of over 500 Brethren now that that was you know enough to let you know that the he a lot of people seen him after he rais all right but now he didn't just raise to tell us a thought or an idea he he raised for a specific purpose all right now keeping it into the line of thought then as Jesus raised now what did he say he said now it'll come a time it'll all end up we'll do this that and the other and he said 'I leaving you but said I'm coming back to be in you and said what you've seen now out here you will see it in the people the disciples the the church you know the early church he was telling them that those things would take place all right we go and we all we want to do is be like I said idiots about things instead of leaving the Bible to believe be it we want to take well Mark 16's not inspired we have proof the last few verses is not inspired well does that mean that you're smarter than mankind I'd even give you Scofield if you want to go back to him he said this Mark 16 was quoted in its entirety by irenius now look on your board back there and you'll see irenius was right there with polycarp which was right there with with the disciples because he was the second Church age messenger all right he was still alive in other words he'd seen Jesus he'd seen so he was quoting that's enough for me but I my point is one thing why do you want to argue that what would be the purpose of arguing whether Mark 16 is inspired or not you're trying to disprove the word of God you're trying to to disprove some way or to make some way to try to show how smart you are okay well what good is all of that you know what good is it what is good has it done for you it just made you uh a person to be able to say well I I saw that well what good is that you're going to face that maker one day with your thoughts all right now so then what are we getting at proof of a resurrection as I said Mark there 16 we want to read the first few verses and we talk about his resurrection and we'll go with that but then we'll drop down to the last of it and we'll get to well we don't believe that whether that's inspired or not I like the way the lady said that time you know when her son told her that Mark 16 wasn't inspired at the Li and she shed started shouting Glory Hallelujah because she'd just been healed and said if God can heal me with part word what can he do if we got it straight so that's the point you know the point is to believe in God not to believe in ourselves or our ideas or whatever our concept see when you're out and you're you're doing you you know yourself that sometimes you finally settle down and and you maybe you might be in the middle of the night or you might be in this or that or the other but then you start thinking right because that's a human being and you start thinking about God in his doings the way he does things you know really you're you're looking at him through what has been made known to you by somebody well my point is what you know yourself there's not a person sitting in this building that has not had one way or the other an experience something that happened something took place something we could talk about for hours of you know I was at this point of death and it was brought back this would happen here and we saw it come back to correct see then there's no need of talking about whether there's a God or not we realize there is we got the proof that there is all right but see he didn't just leave it that way when he went to his resurrection he didn't didn't say well now this is me I'm going to raise you believe this one day we're going to heaven that's kind of way mankind believes it right well you just believe in God you know and you're going to heaven cuz you know they've done away with hell because nobody's going there anymore you don't go to a service anymore and hear somebody say well this person here died and went to hell of course there ain't no need of hatching out bones over a dead person there's no need of doing that but you know what I'm talking about everybody's going to heaven it don't matter what even if you have to like I heard of a person one time said well they paid the parking lot well praise the Lord the parking lot got paid but is that going to send you to heaven no that's that's not the point the point is that I believe down through time from the very beginning that he made the statements that he would raise while he was in his life right you know he talked about his resurrection while he was in his life with the disciples amen well it evidently didn't don't on him too good because after his burial they were kind of down and out right right well that's could be understood see death the burial and thing it could kind of that's kind of understandable that they would be that was but what about somebody started saying well we seen him we seen him that's right but you know that still doesn't do any good until something happens within you that you can believe it you know a lot of people just can't believe that's right I mean that's that's true about a lot of people just can't believe that's right because they just well I don't know where to believe or not I don't know what it is you know but see the point I'm getting at what is your proof of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ we talk about an Easter time we talk about a resurrection but what is it about that's right basically it's about whether he was crucified Thursday Friday Saturday Monday Tuesday whatever day it is they're arguing over that then they argue with this happened here and this happened there we just don't really know well you know that's true they don't know but see then some people begin to believe and that's kind of way it was with the disciples after hearing some of the others they begin to believe and they were gathered together when he appeared to them and I like the way scoffield defines that I don't take all of those things but he defines that like a is not necessarily where it says the 12 he says over in the other scripture when it says 12 number he said that means there was 12 of them but said when this says the apostles see because a lot of them didn't believe right you remember the story in a different accounts where that Jesus appears to them Judas is not with I mean um uh who's the one put your hand in Thomas Thomas Thomas is not with him then he appears another time Thomas is with him so you got all of these different accounts that shows it but it comes forth to show one thing he came to those disciples after his resurrection and they still didn't believe it that's right they get on over to his Ascension in the in the book of of Acts where he starts up and they're still at that time and this is the Ascension going up and they're staying what are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel at this time see they still thought about Earthly things they had no thoughts and here's a man fixing to go up in the sky to leave the Earth and promised he would come back but I there interested in it who's going to run the government who's going to be in the white house right is that about the way it is now who's going to be the president who's going to be here and what's going to be that's for all that's well and good but what does that matter but my point is what see in even after his resurrection to those that would listen he told him go ye into all the world now this the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet on the day of Pentecost that's right but he told him we ready turn tomorrow go you into all the world even if you don't believe the last few few verses if I read these at least agree with the first few verses as being authentic and he says go you and you know teach them and everything go you into all the world but he said I'm going to come back and I'm going with you you're not going to be by yourself so I promised that while I was here I promised I'd come and live in you amen and he said I'll be with you always that's your scripture it didn't say always it said means it's far from here to there that's just means the distance of what you're going all right but see in the Resurrection The Lord Jesus said now look the things I've done they seen the dead raised the sick healed all manner of signs and wonders by the Lord Jesus right right and he said you'll do this amen you'll do these things and said the reason you'll do him he said because I'm going away but I'm coming back and I'll be with you and even in you to the end of the world that's way his statements so he was saying don't worry about you trying to figure out how to do it right cuz you can't figure it out you can't do it see because we can't do them things it's by him coming back and living in you him coming back and living in you so what was the proof of the Resurrection are you with me if you don't have a proof of the Resurrection where are you you just got a Doctrine an idea or a concept of something you're just depending on what so and so says and we read this and he says so and so we read that and he says so and so and we get all bungled up and don't know you know our minds in the garbage camp and we don't know what's the truth amen but you see what was his point of what he was bringing to them I'll be with you even in you right sir go up into Jerusalem and Wait Don't Preach no more don't do none other the things just hold off go up to Jerusalem and wait cuz I've got something I've got to do right cuz it was not all finished at that time that's right even after he had resurrected and everything he said I've got some things I've got to do that's right I got to deliver up this part here I've got to go and I've got to take all of these things but said I'll be back that's right I'll come back and I'll live in you amen that's right what's the proof of the Resurrection what's the proof of whether Jesus was God or who or whatever is doing what is your proof about God Buddha talks about about it hey under this Doctrine under that Doctrine you're promised these things that's right you go down to the mohammadans and different things what you promised all the men is get 70 virgins I never have found out yet what they said to women yet but you know that's beside the point is just always trying to contact the man but see they got promises that's right you remember when Billy Graham was trying to to there to trying to talk to those people and they said well you promis this and you promis that said you promis a life after we got a life after promised by Muhammad Billy Graham had to back off and leave because he could not produce what they were looking for brother R said why in the world didn't he just stand there and call for it don't you believe God would have come on the scene if he had just been honest enough sincere to call for it I believe he would I believe he would have come on the scene but he wasn't sincere enough see because there's something about to experience the disciples what were they running like a bunch of chickens with their head cut off that's right scared to death right you know what I'm talking about after the the the death of Jesus they I mean they just dispersed they just went Every Which Way and even after his resurrection and appearing to him the best they could do was Peter you know what Peter said I go fishing right I mean I go fishing sure you can analyze all that thing and say well he believed he met Jesus while he's fishing so he's going back to fish now you can do all that you get all that theories into your mind but what good is it Peter just didn't believe him right right cuz you know what it's impossible to believe God without God being in you that's the point of the resurrection of whether or not there was a resurrection we can talk about a resurrection we could have viewed it right we could have been there I've been in was in the Philippines one time when they come up to the Easter time and oh man they just they go through a great thing I mean they they start early in the morning and they just start beating themselves and they start these things and going across their back and and it's it Just Tires out the flesh and they just bleeding all over the place I'm talking about riding down the road in the car from here to there and the blood splattering on you all day long they're doing those things they get over in the middle of the day to show how sincere they are on up in the day and they got a little paddle they showed us they got a little paddle and it's got little pieces of of uh glass stuck in the end of it and I seen them do it they would go lay down on the ground and a little child would take that and slap them on the back with it well then when they got up and started moving twisting blood started running out sincerity we watched a man and it was 12 or 13 times that he had been hung on a cross or 12 or 13 maybe 14 years he had went through this same thing to represent Jesus and I have the video showing it pulled in right onto the nails they drove nails they were not drown nails and and they put them in a certain place and pushed him through yeah but they still took his like a knife blade looking thing and they went through his hands and put him on the and then tied him up there and put him on a cross and held him not 5 Seconds not a they were there for quite a while maybe 10 15 20 minutes that he was hanging up there to represent his belief in Jesus Christ but what did he do after the service was over all he wanted was the glory that he'd been put on the cross 15 times 14 times and I'll do it next year you know that's all he wanted there was no sincerity in their lives cuz if it was why wouldn't it accept Jesus Christ and and want to do but what is your proof of the Resurrection amen that's right what is your proof that Jesus Christ raised well I read about it I heard about it I've been there yeah I've been in the Tomb thank God I get to see them things thought you didn't haven't done it I walked in the Tomb and stood in the tomb where that they had had him laying in the grave been there in the garden been all those things but you know what after all of that and I thank God for being so wonderful to tell us he knew more about the scriptures he could quote more scriptures than I could I mean he was just a walking Bible he said he dedicated his heart to the Lord on and I not believing in Jesus Christ now right he's a Jew right he said he dedicated his heart to the Lord 14 13 14 years before to tell the Christians about their land and he said this is your land he said we're not going to the Via Delarosa because I do not know for certain that's where he walked he said what I tell you I can prove that it was there that was wonderful but it never converted him I did get to see him do something when we were in where they had put Jesus and supposingly let him down in a hole to keep him overnight you know and they told us and and the wall was the wall was just like a man that was Bloody leaning up against the wall a form of a man he wouldn't go down in there with us cuz they didn't let us down they'd opened a way up and you walked in you know and I was videoing it and I wanted to do it anyway cuz I figured he was somewhere around but you know we were talking about the where they put him in there and all and I'm doing this just telling you a story and I go this and I see him U right and I go he didn't want it I go I locked right on him and him standing up right looking he claimed he didn't believe in Jesus but he knew more about the scriptures than I did he would tell you the things that took place and he didn't read his Bible he got up every day we got up and got in the bus to go he read the Bible of where or quoted the scriptures where we were going but yet he believed in a in a God cuz we were sitting at the place where the where the demons were cast out and went into the swine and run down the hill and drowned themselves you remember that in the Bible and here was a Jew that claims he doesn't believe in Jesus Christ he said oh yeah I believe in Jesus Christ existed he said I'm trying to tell you he existed said I'm trying to tell you he lived and these are the things that he done he just didn't believe in him as a savior that day he said they have proven right here that they brought a machine out here just recently and said there is an unknown Force right here in this place he said I can feel it right now he was a Believer you I've told you about it that he he had a bad rice on his body and he said he was taking two or three baths every night with hot water if you ever have a rice on you the best thing to do is turn the water as hot as you you can get it and just put it on that spot and just keep you know and it will take away the burning from you and he said I'm doing that every night I said well Reuben I said you're talking about telling us about that Jesus was here and existed he said yes I said but we believe that Jesus said to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I said do you mind if we pray for you he said oh no that I want you to but didn't give it myself if we prayed for him the next morning when he come walking down I said hey Ruben how you doing this morning didn't I take no bass last night we saw miracles happen there prayed for a girl to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost right there where Jesus was that Paul the name was excuse me Paul was at that one cesaria but listen what is my point if you don't have a proof of a resurrection what good is to talk about a resurrection what is the the good to talk about baby laying in a Manger that baby laying in a Manger can't die for your sins he had to grow up long enough to become an adult and live his life he done that for you and I like the prophet would say he said he was a child unto a child he was a teenager to a teenager said he's an adult unto an adult he went through all of those things in life right to live and all but he had proof of the Resurrection listen before he raised all right you with me the proof of the Resurrection before he raised he raised the dead he healed the sick do you believe that you believe he done those things the Bible said he did see he had proof before he ever even come to the resurrection what about after the resurrection after the resurrection see then he told us that we would have that Authority given unto us Amen to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I you want to stand here all afternoon and talk about the things that we've seen that God has done thank we don't talk about a god of History a god of History will do you no good I'm kind of like the fell was that said you know they talking to him but you got to you got to go through this you got to go through the Virgin Mary you got to go through these angels or whatever people you know to get to God he said when I'm in trouble I don't want no secretary that's right and that's trueth that ain't a joke I want to go to the head man talk to him myself right I don't want to have to go through somebody that might mess it up and especially when the computer age it really could get messed up couldn't it you know file it up and then you want all across your screen but listen what am I talking about I'm talking about what is your proof of the Resurrection what good is it to you to talk about a resurrection if you don't have proof of it right right we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick healed amen and a word y just this little group amen amen you said but I just don't believe that well see that's all right a not trying to make you believe nothing I'm just trying to get you to listen to God and see what he says about it he promised it why can't we believe it well you could have f it well let's see you do it I'm not sarcastic nor hateful I'm just saying let's see you do it none of us can do anything except what God gives us right what God gives us because he promised to do that he said I'll be with you even in you don't you worry about it so don't worry about you go to courts and this that and the other he said just wait said I'll be there to take care of it right you know they bring you before the law and things don't argue with them don't fuss with them just wait on him he'll give you the answer amen right see we want to do some mental buildup in our minds and try to think about a God but but is that God real what's the difference in imagination about a God or an imagination about Buddha being God come on what's the difference what's the difference in in believing this or believing that when it won't produce right but see we talk about him being Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but what about the proof of the Resurrection amen what about the proof of the Resurrection because see I believe all the way down to time that there's been a living God living in The Bride of Jesus Christ to fulfill his workj we look down through the Dark Ages and we look at them and those people during that Dark Ages they lost their lives they gave their lives for the gospel take animals and tie them together to a man and just pull him apart read Fox's book of Martyrs and just see about it okay that's supposed to be authentic take and rip a baby out of a mother and throw it to a hog and feed it those people had something that's right that was real right do you think what we've got it would be able to stand the test of that right would it stand the test when they put a gun to your head and said deny your faith you know there was a lot of them did and there was a lot of Records in into the fox and book of waters in a time that a lot of them recanted and then a lot of them came back later and accepted Jesus Christ well that's great that's wonderful but I thought we was to believe in a God that was living what good is a God that you can't get in touch with him and he can't do anything thing for you right I mean what what's a need in believing in a God if you don't believe he can do something for you right want serve him what's the purpose if you can't call him on the scene what's the purpose of even trying to talk about him that's right brother around preached a message one time says raising God from history in that message he was explaining what he meant of saying raising God from history he said he had become historical God to mankind he never bothered me when what was his name alhiser Altier whatever it was they said God is dead back in the in the 60s I a got no problem with that you said well Boy tell you no I have no problem with it because I know he was dead to most people the most people God was dead and that was the point that he was making not that there was not no God he was making the point that there was that God was dead in the lives of the people that's right well that's right is he dead in your life or is he there for you when something happens and like I said have you ever had something really happen that you knew was Supernatural and could not be explained right and how you come out of a wreck how you come out of a of this or that or the other or supposed to been shot supposed to been this that or the other and you come walking out of it without any problems what about proof of a resurrection see truly it says back there he is risen now is that true today to you and I is he's risen today in your thoughts and ideas everybody wants people to try to believe a Doctrine or an idea what good is a doctrine of an or an idea if there's no living God to be with that right well y'all spent a lot of time talking about Prophet brandom you know and all the things that he done well that's true I like to talk about Paul I like to talk about Irene I like to talk as much as I can get I try to get everything I can I like to talk about Smith Wigglesworth and and some of those men back down through there one of those those guys wouldn't even read a newspaper he said there was no use in it I guess he's about right cuz it was no truth in it cuz you can read one day what something happened you read the next day and somebody done changed it right is it true what can you depend on but you see one of those had SE 16 or 17 with it Smith Wiggles work which one was it 16 17 people raised the dead authentically proven right I like to read about those men and their thoughts I don't read about whether they're don't agree with brother brandom I like to read about what they agree in God and to see what God could do right I don't want to leave it just about what God could do with somebody else I want something real for myself sting up on a dear stand one day about that time left arm hit my chur hurting like crazy I was about 15 ft up off the ground sitting on a deer stand sitting there just hurting and hurting all down through my arm and all through and this brain was going haywire and the devil said now I got you he said you're having a heart attack said I got you I sat there for a minute and really I was standing up and I just sat down I said well hey I'm 15 ft closer right I mean you're crazy you think you're having a heart attack and you think about how high you are I said I'm 15t up in the hour what's that matter to me what do I cure what takes place let them find what's left over falls on the ground but I won't be on the ground and you know what happened everything just went away that's right you say well did you tell anybody about it no I didn't tell nobody about it for a long time cuz I got a wife that'll she'll put you in the doctor's office she put you there she went with me one day and they wound up and said I had a heart trouble I told her she wasn't going with me no more I don't allow her to go back there to talk to the doctor anymore that's between me and him we talk on our levels and our Lev was just one thing for sure hey Doc you got anything can help me I'm hurting well how you doing I'm doing wonderful that old heart doctor he he said what are you doing in here CU you know he's supposed to go through this all this rig or to get to a heart specialist you know this guy and he said what are you doing in here I said they sent me over here I said my wife talked to Dr Buster and Dr Buster and my wife got get and I'm over here see I was supposed to went through all kind of Rigs and appointments to be able to get to him he said well what do you do it I said don't know he said well according to what we run here of it that your heart is out of rhythm now not the bad out of rhythm it's there a differences in them I said well so what he said you mean you don't know it I said what am I supposed to know at that time I said I I said I'm 74 years old what's a 74 year old man supposed to act like I said I probably can't ride a tractor over 8 hours dig ditches over 10 out the day none of the kids want to work with me even now at my age cuz they know we're going to stay there we get done planted a garden yesterday put this in that and the other went to doing this went to do that we're all over the place I don't tell them what I wasn't do but I ask him I said what's a 74 year old man supposed to act like he said you're not weak you're not dizzy you're not anything I said no no that's all he says to me now when I go to he said you Ste any different I nope I said listen cuz I told him I said we go to Medical Doctors and we believe in medical doctors I'm talking to a heart specialist I said we go to these and we believe in it and that's fine but I said you're not the Healer right God is the Healer you realize who's taking care of me before you come along what I told one of them one day I said who do you think took care of me before you come along that you could tell me all these things I said I'll do anything you tell me to do except certain things it ain't going to be no damage to me why because I'm not concerned with that why because it was all settled a long time ago I know who the healer is I went in one time I told one doctor I said would you believe that my blood pressure for weeks at General Motors have been running over well over 200s in the top and then about 180 in the bottom and they done it that work and everything checking on me and keeping up with it and I went in there and I said I come to church and we prayed and I said I come up here now for you to check it now you're telling me there's nothing wrong with me my blood pressure is 120 over 80 amen I said would you believe God heal me he said no what he said I didn't it didn't it didn't fluster me I didn't put up no arguments I just walked out and told my wife I said if you expect me to go to the doctor you going to get me another one cuz I ain't going to an idiot he's at least got to be a believer you know that's what I told at heart specialist when I got to he said hey look said I'm a Christian I said well great then we can talk you're not the Healer right cuz that was settled a long time ago with God we know who the healer is we know who does the signs and wonders we know who it is that's living in inside of us that way I'm not SC scared of n not afraid of those things that most of you go haywire when things go wrong why it going to hip you no it's going to make it worse you're going to get frustrated and that's worse on you than anything best thing to do is just sit back and say thank you Lord that's right you hurting sometime just say thank you Lord you know what I developed years ago I come find out I'll tell you the story I I found out this a long time ago if you're hurting in a certain spot just rub it you know just rub it just gently rub that spot and I can show you where that there was a great big pone sticking out right there and I kept rubbing and it's gone right I was sitting talking to that heart specialist one day about some things you know he said Sam he said you know what said them black spots on you I said yeah I know getting old he said next time you hit yourself said just rub it I looked at him I said you mean you've come up with this I said I've known that all along I just I get hurt I just rub it try it sometime don't run to the house I'm Hur I'm Hur just rub it right because it's all in God he gave your body healing factors CA an immune system cuz he knew we'd need it but see why don't you try praying why don't you try thinking him for it CU according the way I read the Bible I'm supposed to what even for salvation I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to believe in my heart that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead Romans what 8 right in there I'm supposed to believe that God died for me and I'm then I'm supposed to confess it with my mouth right all right that's where your healing comes amen your healing comes from the basis that you believe that he died for you and then you confess it right right thank you Lord am the Bible said he what makes intercession upon what our confessions right now listen I'm honest I I always Tred to just be truthful the Bible doesn't say if you're a Christian and you confess that God will heal you now that's extra because you got a closer run right you understand what I mean you're closer to him if you're a Believer but if you're not a Believer won't you start confessing It Anyway won't you try that even if you're not a Christian say well thank you Lord right you know what you might confess your way under salvation you know he might contact you somewhere that's right but what are you saying proof of the Resurrection amen is the Christ that's living in you cuz that's what it's been all the way down through time cuz that's what he said I'm going away but I'm going to come back and I'm going to live in you yes sir amen he said that's going to be proof of the Resurrection the things I do what does the Bible say you shall do also and what does it say greater right not because we could do something greater but because there's more of us right there was one of him now there's a bride around the worlden confess your way into healing confess your way into salvation yes right amen won't you brag on him a little bit right now Gina is it so that you can brag on Mark and get what you want she don't like me I just talk playing to her but it's true ain't it it sure ain't true that you go tell the B then try to get something you understand Zach and Anna you don't go around with I don't like no you brag on each other and then you pretty well get what you want amen well is not is not that true with God right don't you think he wants to be bragged on you don't ever thank him for what he's done for you right you don't don't ever thank him for saving you you don't ever thank in him for for healing you am sister cetus sitting back there 90 years old takes no medicine right now she' tell you she's not against medicine that's fine well you know it might just be our confession it just might be what we believe it might be the resurrection working right it's proof of the Resurrection anyway anyone that's healed anywhere by anything what methods or whatever took place is a direct proof that the resurrection he is risen that's right yes sir right direct proof that he is risen not talking about he has risen or will raise or whatever no amen but he's risen right now what good is salvation without a God that's risen you don't have none the best way to say it you don't have anything right what does Easter mean to you I like what brother WBY used to say he said never did understand how they had them eggly and rabbits but you know you go around for Easter and everybody's got egg lay and rabbits well what good is an eggly and rabbit I hadn't found one yet but what good would it be if it was true what about a living God that will come and live inside of you hey come on I'm talking plain if you've never had an experience with God he'll come to you somewhere right he'll give you a change that's right amen and you'll know it right amen he'll talk to you and he'll know it he'll come and he'll try to reason with you and try to show you what the truth is amen that heaven help you to turn it down that's right right just don't turn down when he comes to you to talk to you amen amen you don't have to be able to understand this or understand that or all about God and and all of this and I don't understand this or understand that what y'all talking about that ain't got nothing to do with it that's right it has because it's God's word but the truth is is whether or not you can accept Jesus Christ I like the way the prophet said it in Christ of Min God reveal he said said he could be revealed to the most illiterate person now that's the kind of God that our Prophet we talk about believed in we talk about an illiterate person we think well they can't be saved why not amen are you the one that decides whether or not they can the most illiterate person can just actually see God living in a reality right but you know what's the greatest Resurrection sign there is Christ Living in you living before your neighbors your brothers and sisters your family living in you to show Jesus Christ that's right hey we're all failures no problem don't talk to me about well we're not perfect well according to the Bible he says we are so now you're going to argue with him right he said be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect right well you know how can a person be perfect by a sacrifice that was made that's right right am even the Indian with the totem pole come on I Tred to te I try to be sensible even an IND an Indian with a totem pole he believes that that imaginary God in there can speak to him and you know what he can it might be be in imaginary ways but still it can work well what about believing in the real God what about it come on musicians think on these things what does a resurrection mean to you we've seen healings and signs and wonders amen that are unquestionable that's right right we've seen things happen that is unquestionable but why don't we believe in that God Amen why don't we say thank you Lord and just come and speak to me just remember in the middle of the night he'll come to you hallu you said well how do you know the difference between God and the devil talking cuz the devil can talk too yeah that's good he can but just remember the devil will always be trying to destroy you with his words God will always be trying to lift you up so what I I've been a Christian a long time and this this Voice keeps telling me I'm lost well so what if he didn't do that what do you think he was doing with the Lord Jesus he said if thou be the Son of God come down off the cross and I'll hear it I mean come down off this mountain here and I'll take care of this I'll do all these things if if if that's who you are why not just be a Christian amen and let Christ live in you am we can't manufacture things because that's not according to truth but we can believe that God can take care of all things amen and he will amen if we'll let him let's stand what we got brother we're going to just s a little anybody have a need let some of the sisters go downstairs and get ready with the food and get everything fixed up to where we can have a little food to eat and whatever to do pray for my father going for father he's in the

exalted it goes down sure we need to tell what God says and things that's great but you don't have to have it why couldn't you believe me and let me tell you say well Lord told me so and so was going
