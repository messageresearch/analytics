[21:37] great amen
[21:39] glad to be here yeah we've made the
[21:42] statement Wednesday night we'll make it
[21:44] again tomorrow where you can understand
[21:46] if you want to set down the stars
[21:49] feel free to there's nobody ruling
[21:53] nothing of doing if you want to sit down
[21:56] stars and view the services it will be
[21:58] made available if you want to come into
[22:00] your car and park out in a parking lot
[22:03] it will be made available to wear that
[22:06] you can because we don't want nobody to
[22:08] feel that they're obligated to have to
[22:12] do this that or the other this is all
[22:14] coming to church should be volunteer
[22:16] basis anyway nobody can go out and
[22:19] compel you to do and make this that or
[22:22] the other and in all that's not true not
[22:24] the right thing to do but just it you
[22:27] know if you want to if you want to or
[22:31] brothers are having a mask if you want
[22:33] to wear a mask that's fine
[22:35] nobody has any problems we just want you
[22:38] to be satisfied within your own self and
[22:41] doing your own part and serving the lord
[22:45] from that does everybody understand that
[22:47] that do it now I make a couple of
[22:49] announcements this morning that a figure
[22:51] need to be made you know we don't know
[22:55] what the hour is of how that things are
[22:57] going to keep working and what they're
[23:00] going to do we do what we do
[23:03] for the church and you know and and
[23:06] doing the best that we can to serve God
[23:08] here in the search and the doings and
[23:11] and to serve Him because that's the one
[23:14] we're here to serve we're not here to
[23:16] try to satisfy anybody else I think that
[23:20] we done the right decisions when we made
[23:23] the decisions to you know move about do
[23:26] things and and everything like that I
[23:28] think it was right to do that and
[23:31] if necessary we'll do it again whatever
[23:33] is necessary because as long as the
[23:37] government is not fooling with our
[23:39] spirituality I feel that we can you know
[23:44] go along with what they're doing and
[23:46] things like that maybe 30 40 years ago
[23:49] you might have had a different idea and
[23:51] I might have had a different idea but
[23:53] still it's come down to the last days
[23:56] you know I've altered you from day one I
[23:59] don't believe this is the end of the
[24:01] world and that respect
[24:03] but I believe it is the beginning of the
[24:05] end I believe it's in the basis of the
[24:08] volunter state because he's going to
[24:10] come in by flattery you know invited in
[24:13] and etc like that not forcefully so it
[24:16] won't be a great forceful thing to
[24:18] beginning it's going to be gradual you
[24:20] know you say well what do you think
[24:22] about the economy for this I don't know
[24:25] because man they can change this thing
[24:28] before we get home that's serious and it
[24:32] is very serious so I've encouraged you
[24:34] to do one thing
[24:36] I'll get your ducks in a row for
[24:38] naturally speaking and things like that
[24:41] you know keep everything going don't go
[24:44] out and and you know be wild about it
[24:48] just be what you want to be and and
[24:50] serve God and and you know like that now
[24:53] and that would we'll take care of a lot
[24:55] of the the situation's of life because
[24:59] we don't know you know I don't know
[25:02] we've never been at a place like this
[25:05] now we've had world time troubles and
[25:08] we've had countries that had troubles
[25:10] but we never had a time that the entire
[25:13] world was at a problem it's not just our
[25:17] nation and not just our point every
[25:19] nation in the world is is involved in
[25:22] this because it is an economical Christ
[25:26] I don't know why it was brought on I've
[25:28] told you somebody else that's pulling
[25:30] the strings that's all I can say and all
[25:33] I know it ain't this that or the other
[25:36] you well I'm against this I'm against
[25:38] there we're just doing the best we can
[25:40] to survive and and be a Christian
[25:43] in what we're doing so remember that way
[25:46] and keep it in mind and like I said if
[25:48] you want to go down start if you want to
[25:50] do those things do it and feel free to
[25:52] but to you that want to come up here and
[25:54] sit down and worship and and have a good
[25:57] time in the Lord we can worse you can
[25:59] sing down stars whether you can sing up
[26:01] stars you know you can do all of the
[26:04] things and we can have that alright now
[26:07] it may come until word that we don't
[26:10] know from data one to two you may be and
[26:13] we all may be without a job within a
[26:16] week oh that's been proven that it's
[26:18] been done alright that's what I my
[26:21] warning is is to look at the signs
[26:24] around us because they can do anything
[26:27] they want to naturally speaking you know
[26:30] because they can just whack it down
[26:31] right now and some of you have already
[26:34] had to take pay cuts you've already had
[26:36] to be up days off you've already had to
[26:38] change things so you don't know what
[26:40] that's going to be now the only thing
[26:42] I'm going to make this away and make it
[26:46] to where we can stay clear with
[26:48] everything we as the church cannot pay
[26:53] everybody's bills I mean that's just you
[26:56] know we can't do it we don't have the
[26:58] money that's plain all right but you
[27:01] know but we've always tried to help
[27:03] everybody that had a need and you let
[27:07] your needs be known the Bible says and
[27:09] you can let them be known to the Deacons
[27:11] the Deacons will transfer that up the
[27:13] line coming on up to the things and you
[27:17] can talk it over with them and it'll
[27:19] finally come up to the basis through the
[27:21] trustees and own out if there's anything
[27:24] that has to be handled it will be
[27:27] brought down to the last two which is
[27:29] Terrance is the CEO of the church the
[27:32] way the government is set up I said the
[27:34] way the government is set up I'm the
[27:36] pastor of the church the way the church
[27:38] is set up so then that way we make the
[27:40] final authorities will be brought
[27:42] through into that basis so don't just
[27:45] say well what I'm going to remember it's
[27:47] gonna have to go through change to go up
[27:50] word code we may be all without a job it
[27:53] may be to the point that we're saying
[27:55] okay we'll give you 20 bucks get
[27:56] gasps to come church and we'll do the
[27:59] best weekend as long as we can but we
[28:02] can't pay you payments just make that
[28:04] plain and blunt we can't pay your car
[28:06] payments your house payment is that and
[28:08] you shouldn't expect it to be all right
[28:11] and for heaven's sake don't keep money
[28:14] in your bank account or in a joke out in
[28:17] the yard anywhere you put your money you
[28:20] know what I'm saying you can put it in
[28:22] the you know everybody looking at my jug
[28:24] in the yard you know I'd be good on the
[28:26] internet but the old-time way was to
[28:29] take a fruit jar and put it in the fruit
[28:30] jar and set it out in the yard and hide
[28:32] it that was the bank you had you were
[28:35] banking on that fruit jar holding it and
[28:38] some of you're old enough to realize
[28:39] that that did happen in a lot of cases
[28:41] but we're not able to handle everything
[28:43] so you shouldn't expect to come and ask
[28:47] for help if you have money in your bank
[28:52] account in any form I said it with
[28:56] minute minute Wes said it any form if
[28:59] you got it in the you know bank account
[29:04] you got it in and all of these other
[29:06] things that can be done don't expect
[29:08] somebody to pay your bills for you if
[29:10] you have money in your name that
[29:13] shouldn't be a Christian attitude all
[29:16] right so don't just don't ask that
[29:19] shouldn't be in we're talking about
[29:21] things when we have need to work that we
[29:24] have to handle things we have over the
[29:28] years here giving a lot of people money
[29:30] to come to church you know just taking
[29:33] maybe some are still doing that I don't
[29:35] ask questions but you know we expect to
[29:39] do stuff like that we'll do it as much
[29:40] as we possibly can and keep it as
[29:43] straight as we can but keep it to where
[29:45] we can can be able to handle it so even
[29:49] anything that said repeat now everybody
[29:52] standing up so you're not believers
[29:54] White's if you want to go to the
[29:57] basement feel up free to if you want to
[29:59] wear face masks feel free to if you want
[30:01] to do those things if you need it and
[30:04] all like that do it if you have a need
[30:07] then let us know through
[30:10] the chain you can come through the
[30:11] Deacons it can come up the chain up to
[30:13] to myself and into Terrence to where
[30:16] that we can help if you need it
[30:19] but remember just make sure that you
[30:21] don't hold up money and and keep it in
[30:25] somewhere hidden there are some secret
[30:27] bank account you know to where that it
[30:29] won't be done okay let's see I've got it
[30:34] wrote down because that would have to
[30:36] come through all of it has to come
[30:37] through once we're sitting of the way
[30:40] we're doing it everything has to come
[30:42] through a channel upward and come
[30:46] through the Board of Directors to where
[30:48] that they can handle things but the
[30:50] final decisions will be brought down to
[30:52] the life's to this there'd be Terrance
[30:55] in my cell so that'll be you know you
[30:57] won't be nobody won't having to do
[30:59] anything we haven't we'll do it out of
[31:00] ways everybody understand that's it's
[31:03] not something we're just saying this
[31:05] because we don't know what's gonna have
[31:07] we may have to cut I told the brothers
[31:09] always told the missionary brothers we
[31:12] still hope we still do our missionary as
[31:14] much as we can we will
[31:16] we'll send money to the missionaries as
[31:18] much as we can but I told them to start
[31:21] with they'll come a time when we can't
[31:23] send it so don't burden us about trying
[31:26] to get it because we don't have it see
[31:29] we have to take care of our home first
[31:31] everything here and then we can take
[31:34] care of other things later okay
[31:37] all right any other things that would be
[31:39] said remember now to the ladies this
[31:43] coming Thursday you will be headed that

[34:07] visions one Paul an apostle of Jesus
[34:10] Christ by the will of God to the Saints
[34:13] which are at Ephesus and to the faithful
[34:15] in Christ Jesus grace be to you and
[34:18] peace from God our Father and from the
[34:21] Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and
[34:24] father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath
[34:26] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[34:28] in heavenly places in Christ what is the
[34:31] believers position heavenly places
[34:34] according as he has chosen us in him
[34:38] that was what we were on last Sunday
[34:41] can't earring on with her thought chosen
[34:45] us in him before the foundation of the
[34:48] world that we should be holy and without
[34:50] blame before him in love having
[34:53] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[34:56] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[34:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[35:01] will he may be seated Lord at his
[35:03] blessing to the reading of the word as I
[35:09] said there last Sunday I think it's
[35:11] still a good idea to do I came in today
[35:14] done my usual routine Terrence doesn't
[35:17] know he comes behind me does it too but
[35:20] all the doorknobs all of the rails
[35:23] coming up and down everything is wiped
[35:25] down with stuff I think that's a good
[35:27] idea I mean I don't think it's any
[35:30] problem I think it's a good idea you say
[35:33] well we ought not be sealing to will
[35:35] then go drink alcohol you know don't be
[35:39] silly
[35:39] let's go get you a bottle alcohol
[35:41] drinking some of it don't worry about it
[35:43] you know what I'm saying say let's don't
[35:46] be silly let's be brothers and sisters
[35:49] in Christ and let it all work out for
[35:52] the glory of the Lord okay now I've got
[35:54] a little something now got to explain
[35:56] because of the lies message but I hope
[35:59] you understand is right Aaron What did
[36:01] he say Wednesday night don't take what I
[36:03] say take what what I mean okay see last
[36:09] Sunday I made a lot of slip back and
[36:12] forth because that message was an
[36:14] injection
[36:15] I had notes to go in another way and it
[36:19] turned out but I kept saying to begin
[36:21] with that Paul and Peter had you know
[36:24] they never had no differences well I
[36:26] still true I wasn't freaking about Paul
[36:30] and Peter but that was in my mind and it
[36:32] just kept running and Paul and Peter did
[36:34] have a difference but it was never a
[36:37] difference in doctrine so what I was a
[36:39] saying was right so take what I meant
[36:42] the Paul and Peter had according to the
[36:46] scriptures they had problems there
[36:47] and Paul had to rebuke Peter but brother
[36:51] Brennan said they had no problems in
[36:54] doctrine everything was right he said
[36:57] that proved the whole thing you know God
[36:59] can keep us together all right
[37:01] but then see what it is is Paul and G
[37:04] and James was the two that I was
[37:07] bringing it forward because I was trying
[37:09] to explain the point of what I said we
[37:13] need to cover not to study in the
[37:17] Armenian in a Calvinistic form but to
[37:21] you know I don't really care for
[37:22] crossing that because you know it'll be
[37:24] fine we will to a degree but see Paul
[37:28] and James never had no contradictions
[37:31] you know no and I kept making mistake
[37:36] but I noticed in there so just without
[37:38] all that other you own the internet and
[37:40] it is you know just put that to the
[37:42] eight-year-old forget it but remember
[37:44] Paul and Peter did have problems they
[37:47] had troubles but nothing in doctrine you
[37:51] know that's what I love about that
[37:52] because that was too born-again
[37:54] Christians expressing their their point
[37:58] of view and thing and Peter just getting
[38:01] caught in a little bit of a natural
[38:03] thing you know that probably happens to
[38:05] us every day just about it and Paul said
[38:08] now Peter that ain't right you know you
[38:11] shouldn't do that but it wasn't anything
[38:12] to be derogatory to Peter that he was
[38:16] doing anything wrong it was just the
[38:18] fact that Peter wasn't behaving himself
[38:20] because really the story is he studied
[38:23] it is that they had this meeting they
[38:26] got together and they was a bunch of
[38:27] brothers together and Peter was over
[38:31] here talking with these brothers and
[38:32] associating with him but when Paul steps
[38:35] in Peter kind of backs away runs over
[38:38] kind of little Locker maybe that Peter
[38:41] was a little bit embarrassed at the time
[38:43] or something happened but anyhow there
[38:45] was no doctrine and Paul said okay now
[38:48] Peter that ain't right said because what
[38:51] she was doing while ago before James and
[38:54] myself and these others coming in
[38:56] because James was the one caught into
[38:57] not this James now that we're talking
[38:59] about in the book
[39:00] but that james r was called the legalist
[39:03] you know he was kind of a turn legalish
[39:06] but he was one of the Brethren all right
[39:08] so then he said now when when we came in
[39:11] said you run away from these brothers
[39:14] well they're just little embarrass and
[39:16] he said you shouldn't do that
[39:17] well Paul never said it well I mean
[39:19] Peter never said worried about what Paul
[39:21] said he's a matter of fact he bragged on
[39:24] him he said no Paul you gotta watch him
[39:26] cuz sometimes that he says things hard
[39:28] to be understood he said a lot of them
[39:31] struggle to her own destruction trying
[39:33] to do right but what were we talking
[39:35] about James and Paul James is counted by
[39:42] mankind as being more of the legalistic
[39:46] Armenian side of works all right show me
[39:53] that your faith without your works and
[39:57] I'll show you my faith by my works okay
[39:59] right now Paul was more counted by I'm
[40:04] saying it the well meaning now by
[40:07] mankind
[40:08] he was counted more or less to be a
[40:10] Calvinist because it was more you know
[40:14] on God has done this it's taken care of
[40:16] we don't have to worry about it all of
[40:18] this that and the other but I kept
[40:20] making the statements but I didn't read
[40:22] them but I want you to think about it
[40:26] because maybe you wouldn't understand me
[40:29] to say it but I looked like one thing is
[40:31] going one way and one going another but
[40:33] remember if you keep them going that
[40:36] away don't forget this Calvinism and
[40:40] Arminianism is both in the Bible the
[40:44] scriptures for both of them all right
[40:47] now and they're right in what Paul and
[40:51] James said what they were teaching was
[40:56] right he said no no no no no you're not
[40:59] listening what they were teaching is
[41:02] right what you think they were teaching
[41:05] is where the wrong comes in what mankind
[41:07] thinks about it
[41:09] because there was no contradiction
[41:11] between James and Paul
[41:14] well James wouldn't it was an Armenian
[41:17] that no no James wasn't an Armenian Paul
[41:21] was not a Calvinist it's what we call
[41:25] him to be we credit that to me we say
[41:28] that Paul was Calvinistic in his teeth
[41:31] Paul was not Calvinistic in his teaching
[41:33] remember you're dealing with two
[41:35] born-again believers faith of God statue
[41:39] of a perfect man at least up to what it
[41:41] says and the headstone hadn't come yet
[41:43] but at least at that point you gotta
[41:44] count Peter and Paul and James and John
[41:48] and order those up at that position
[41:52] because it was the faith of the fathers
[41:55] so James was a born-again believer and
[41:59] what he was saying was right see that's
[42:04] what's hard for people to say is you
[42:06] said but now he was Armenian no he
[42:08] wasn't
[42:09] I mean Ian he was a born-again Christian
[42:13] faith of the fathers saying what the
[42:16] same thing Paul was saying the same
[42:18] thing James was saying James was saying
[42:20] the same thing Paul it's a way of saying
[42:22] it that's worth it after I'm warning you
[42:25] and I that that's the easiest way for us
[42:28] to get messed up and I believe that's
[42:31] what's wrong with the people of this
[42:33] message trying to follow the Prophet
[42:35] because they take what they wanted the
[42:38] quotes and they run it down the line
[42:42] they'll take what they want of the
[42:44] quotes and they run it down another line
[42:45] I don't believe in that I never have
[42:49] I've always been maybe that's mean I'm
[42:51] sorry if I've ever had any ministry
[42:54] whatsoever it's in the one line that
[42:58] have always been tore let's take this
[43:00] and this and see it come together
[43:04] and when we do we've got a revelation
[43:07] because now listen
[43:09] Calvinism by itself is wrong I'm gonna
[43:13] fixing to read it to you
[43:16] arminianism by itself is wrong it's
[43:21] wrong I mean I'm who runs that is wrong
[43:24] but when you put them together in the
[43:27] middle of the road
[43:28] you got a revelation right so you know
[43:34] let's let's read that if we don't get
[43:36] into the main part of the message we
[43:38] will at least get this cleared up but
[43:40] let's go go ahead to number one brothers
[43:42] and let's get started on this at least
[43:46] clear this part up right here because I
[43:48] want you to this is what I want you to
[43:50] see all right he says I'm taking the
[43:55] Bible and say anything here like the
[43:58] church says the Holy Ghost was for just
[44:00] for the group back there you can take
[44:01] the Bible this point what you can make
[44:03] it say what you want to but if you take
[44:06] the Bible in the wording of the Bible
[44:08] and correctness you can't make it say
[44:11] what you want it just like it's you
[44:12] twisting what you're reading you're not
[44:15] reading the Bible the Bible is not
[44:17] contradictory okay so what the church
[44:20] says so in the scripture says whosoever
[44:22] will I can't make that hit the target I
[44:25] can't make Calvinism just believe on the
[44:29] Lord and you got eternal security now he
[44:33] said I can't just go that way
[44:35] well yes you'll hear a man explaining
[44:37] but that's exactly the way you come to
[44:39] salvation it's believing on the Lord
[44:41] Jesus Christ that brings you to eternal
[44:45] security but what's he saying just
[44:49] believing in the Lord if you I can't
[44:52] make Calvinism like mankind believes it
[44:55] to believe in the Lord he rolled it up
[44:59] mr. Hurley I can't make Calvinism just
[45:03] believing the Lord and you got eternal
[45:05] security and Arminianism that if I just
[45:08] touch not handle not taste not I'd like
[45:13] to do it but I can't do it he said I
[45:16] can't take those two
[45:18] because one is going one way and one is
[45:20] going down that's right now watch what
[45:26] he says he's got I've got to see where
[45:29] they both got scripture but it's got to
[45:32] hit the target work now in the middle
[45:35] okay Arminianism is too far away from
[45:39] Calvinism and they both are wrong okay
[45:43] now we're reading what a prophet says
[45:45] Calvinism is wrong our meaning ISM is
[45:48] wrong yet and we're gonna read where he
[45:51] says they're right all right let's see
[45:55] Calvinism by itself is wrong our median
[46:01] isn't by itself is wrong uh-huh but just
[46:07] got to hit the target and in the middle
[46:09] and when it does I say it this way but I
[46:16] can prove back up what he said see to me
[46:20] Calvinism proves Arminianism is right
[46:24] okay you're not listening to what I'm
[46:30] saying you're listening to what you
[46:32] think I'm trying to say no see
[46:36] arminianism by itself is wrong because
[46:40] it leans totally to works all right
[46:45] arminianism is wrong excuse me
[46:47] arminianism is wrong go to leanings work
[46:48] Calvinism leans to call it we call it
[46:51] grace but yet put them together the ever
[47:02] born-again believer I'll say it this way
[47:07] the deeper depths that understanding to
[47:10] bring you on into here until it depends
[47:14] on the fact of whether or not we can
[47:16] look at these things and come out with
[47:20] the right point and that's why I said it
[47:26] Paul's not a Calvinist he's a born-again
[47:29] Christian
[47:30] James is not an Armenian he's a
[47:32] born-again Christian both of us got
[47:35] truth but put them together and then
[47:41] they don't contradict each other right
[47:45] see which one are you
[47:50] I believe in works don't you
[47:55] I thought our works wish to follow our
[47:58] salvation I thought we were supposed to
[48:01] be Christians and live right now you're
[48:04] coming to the middle of the road then
[48:06] you're coming to the basis of seeing
[48:08] that Calvinism by itself won't work I
[48:11] mean it is more but put them together
[48:16] and you got a born-again believer who's
[48:20] serving God out of a pure heart cuz
[48:24] listen to what you probably has to say
[48:29] going into the next one cuz we'll hold
[48:32] that one faith without works is dead
[48:37] first thing it looks like Paul was
[48:39] speaking to the Romans 4th chapter just
[48:42] to find that it looks like he was
[48:45] justifying Abraham by faith and James is
[48:48] justifying him by works but it does not
[48:55] contradict well now you got one quote up
[49:01] here that he says well I said what's
[49:03] broad said he said there's wrong
[49:07] well they wasn't wrong we were the ones
[49:10] wrong well then when the Prophet comes
[49:14] forth and says James and Paul wouldn't
[49:18] contradictory see then I believe that
[49:23] but yet if you go across the street over
[49:26] here you'll find one or the other
[49:28] prevalent and do it and it's like I said
[49:31] I I listen to my own services I did
[49:33] twice this week so see if make sure I
[49:36] get things the way that I need to get it
[49:39] I made a statement in there that's
[49:41] probably a lot of you didn't think too
[49:43] much about
[49:43] but you know that ever born-again
[49:45] believer starts as a baby you start as a
[49:49] baby
[49:51] your babes in Christ according to the
[49:53] Bible right the Bible says we're babes
[49:59] in Christ well you don't want a baby in
[50:01] a legalist because you know yourself you
[50:11] used to things people go walking by on
[50:14] you you know you're looking at it and
[50:19] well they're not a Christian but then
[50:23] town goes on and you kind of get settled
[50:25] down and you see things and you say well
[50:27] you know I didn't I shouldn't have
[50:29] thought that about that person because
[50:32] I'm I'm in a sunshade we'll see a baby
[50:37] looks at everything legalistic I don't
[50:42] do this I don't do that I don't drink I
[50:44] don't know I don't well alright but see
[50:48] that's where God allows things I guess
[50:49] to happen to work maybe it fits in a
[50:52] situation but you see that's what I've
[50:56] been told to ever since we've been in
[50:57] this message we don't do this we don't
[50:58] do that we don't the women don't cut to
[51:00] her they don't paint their face they
[51:02] don't well that's great it's a if it's
[51:05] from a born-again experience if not it's
[51:07] just something that's you know that
[51:11] people do so we're either legalistic are
[51:15] we Armenian one of the two so we better
[51:18] consider it I'm not preaching to
[51:20] somewhere else I'm preaching here in
[51:22] Lula anybody else to listen that's their
[51:23] business I'm talking here are we
[51:26] Calvinists ether we Armenian I want to
[51:33] be both because both of them how
[51:37] scripture so I want the scripture all
[51:41] right listen to what the Prophet is
[51:43] saying
[51:49] like Abraham by faith James is
[51:52] justifying him but works but it does not
[51:55] contradict Paul was speaking of what God
[51:58] saw in Abraham and James was speaking
[52:02] what man saw in Abraham both of them
[52:08] looking at the same man right one of
[52:14] them sees him and thinks he's a little
[52:15] bit too much on the legalistic side the
[52:19] other one sees in thanks he's a little
[52:21] bit too much on the gray side but I'm
[52:26] gonna say this now whether you like it
[52:27] or not I think if it'll come together in
[52:30] the middle you get a revelation and
[52:32] listen I'm gonna say it now if it don't
[52:35] come together as being one thing you do
[52:38] not have a revelation
[52:42] that's as plain as I can be whether you
[52:45] like the pawn or whatever that's just
[52:47] the way I've always been I believe your
[52:50] works is supposed to prove what's inside
[52:54] of you I believe that I believe you
[52:59] should live a Christian life we have
[53:03] failures and problems right we do wrong
[53:09] all right if we hang to the Calvinistic
[53:11] we're gonna miss it
[53:12] see if you know how something really
[53:15] know if you keep leaning on the
[53:16] Calvinistic and keep doing wrong then
[53:19] you gonna you're gonna be lost cause
[53:21] you're gonna lose yourself so we better
[53:25] believe it make the right way to say it
[53:27] but that's all right
[53:28] forgive me lord give me something else
[53:30] we better depend on getting this much of
[53:32] that word that's right over here on
[53:34] Armenian is I mean get that right and
[53:36] get this over here that's right on
[53:38] Calvinism and give it right and put them
[53:40] together the work won't be contrary one
[53:44] to the other then that way we we can say
[53:48] hey wait a minute you mean that we have
[53:51] a right to go out and do it no no no no
[53:53] Calvinism never talked to her Paul never
[53:56] told that she had a right to go out and
[53:58] live like the devil but still claim to
[54:00] be hey be a safe Christian
[54:02] that's what I'm trying to get you to say
[54:04] he never taught that that's what man
[54:07] says he told well we can't figure it out
[54:11] called Paul says it's and James says it
[54:13] well why can't you say both them saying
[54:16] the same thing they're not contrary one
[54:18] to the other now you can see that when
[54:22] you get a revelation of a true
[54:24] born-again Christian a true born-again
[54:31] Christian lives each day in their life
[54:35] not trying to do things to please God no
[54:42] don't don't try to appease God there's
[54:45] no need what could we do time we get
[54:47] through trying to feed them and
[54:48] something devil don't come up with
[54:49] something else don't worry about it just
[54:52] be a Christian you mean now your sisters
[54:57] don't cut you higher does that mean
[55:00] you're saved
[55:00] no but if you go cut your hair off it
[55:06] could prove your loss okay okay
[55:14] is that true see we're gonna prove what
[55:18] we are you know see that way you don't
[55:24] have to make yourself do or not do and
[55:30] then you would in no way say well boy
[55:34] I'm glad I didn't do like brother Dale
[55:36] did because I don't know where God would
[55:38] have saved me if I'd have done what he
[55:39] done well I don't believe you would
[55:44] cause none of us didn't do nothing worth
[55:47] any time I mean the whole thing the
[55:50] whole nine yards you better believe in a
[55:53] little bit of grace
[55:54] now don't be into disgrace because
[55:57] that's us badness we went into disgrace
[55:59] with it and I'm not throwing off on them
[56:00] just saying what it was they said once
[56:03] saved always say we've ever said we're
[56:06] gonna be safe well that would be true if
[56:07] you truly was born again but if you're
[56:09] not saved then you're gonna go back to
[56:11] where you come from
[56:12] gonna go through the wall of the Mater
[56:15] my slob uh-huh but you see that's what
[56:22] I'm trying to get us to see are we
[56:23] Armenian or are we Calvinists or do we
[56:26] have enough of each side of it to
[56:27] understand
[56:28] I believe brother Brennan's message
[56:34] what's the putting together of those
[56:40] signs when they say imagine divorce he
[56:45] says he'd go so far out this way he says
[56:47] you fall off he said you go so far out
[56:49] this way he said you fall off
[56:52] he said come back to the middle of the
[56:54] road and just be a Christian they all
[57:01] right let's get the next one number
[57:04] three they learned the message that I
[57:10] word now Paul was justifying Abraham by
[57:13] faith
[57:14] James justify didn't by works Paul said
[57:18] Abraham was justified Romans 4 by faith
[57:22] so James comes over and says that he was
[57:25] justified but worse now both of them one
[57:32] confirmed the other remember who started
[57:40] off he said they're both wrong all right
[57:42] you take Calvinism by itself it's wrong
[57:45] you take arminianism but I say that's
[57:47] wrong put them together you got a
[57:49] revelation in the middle then you can
[57:54] see why that we do have an advocate to
[57:57] take our place but yet we don't use our
[58:01] advocate for I've always told you you
[58:05] know an angel will have to apologize to
[58:09] mine when I get there cause I've done
[58:11] wore him out he probably had to call in
[58:13] help for reinforcements you know because
[58:16] and I don't mean that jokingly I mean
[58:17] it's truth we're just human beings sure
[58:20] we make mistakes we do wrong but that
[58:22] don't mean we're lost
[58:25] so are you getting to which one you're
[58:27] on which side are you on
[58:28] well Brazil you've done that you're lost
[58:30] where does it show that in the Bible you
[58:37] got to get them both together seeing one
[58:39] of them will confirm the other one it's
[58:44] confirmed make it an established I put
[58:46] it into order or bring it to where it's
[58:48] supposed to be all right
[58:52] Calvinism is right we believe in doing
[58:54] the things and not doing the things we
[58:58] believe in it that's a Christian we
[59:01] don't live like the devil in turnaround
[59:02] say I believe in Paul's Calvinism now
[59:05] Paul didn't have that kind of Calvinism
[59:07] that's what I'm talking about Paul never
[59:12] taught Calvinism that away that's what
[59:15] we take you mister being teaching
[59:18] neither did James teach this you could
[59:20] be saved because of your works works is
[59:24] faith expressed we're supposed to be a
[59:28] Christian we're supposed to live like
[59:30] Christians act like Christians we're
[59:35] supposed to be a Christian not to have
[59:36] to well others don't understand you
[59:42] because you go one way then you go the
[59:44] other way well I'll give you the pulpit
[59:47] one day you want it come in just plain
[59:49] it I don't mean that jokingly I mean it
[59:53] right see if they don't both come
[59:58] together how can one confirm the other
[1:00:03] to your faith that you have in God is
[1:00:07] confirmed in the basis of how you live
[1:00:15] the way you live confirms what's within
[1:00:20] you are shows what's within you and sees
[1:00:28] in that way I don't have to worry about
[1:00:29] it you say what about us children I
[1:00:32] don't know that's what I'm trying my
[1:00:33] best to explain it to the children and
[1:00:37] all
[1:00:37] of us but I found out a long time ago
[1:00:42] that the older children is one you how
[1:00:44] the trouble trying to explain something
[1:00:45] to you like that or love it
[1:00:48] the older ones are the ones you have
[1:00:51] trouble trying to explain it to the
[1:00:53] children they just take what you say
[1:00:58] then they realize well hey brother Dale
[1:01:01] he he says a lot of things that are
[1:01:03] crazy but you know what he loves this
[1:01:05] and he tries to help us and he does
[1:01:06] everything for us and he's trying to do
[1:01:09] this he's trying to do that he's tried
[1:01:11] to be a Christian before us I believe
[1:01:13] that I believe in just being what you
[1:01:16] are
[1:01:16] I don't have to make up nothing I don't
[1:01:20] have to get up in the morning say well
[1:01:22] I'm a Christian so I got to act like one
[1:01:23] today I would I'd differ but I gotta act
[1:01:26] like a crucian cuz I'm expected to know
[1:01:29] I get up saying lord help me this night
[1:01:33] but I know I'm gonna stumble and fall so
[1:01:37] you help me and so Lord take care of it
[1:01:39] then it not the last thing I say Lord
[1:01:41] I'm sorry for all of the day and what
[1:01:43] I've been go to have it been right and
[1:01:45] haven't done what I should have done and
[1:01:47] I should have done this or should have
[1:01:49] done that but Lord forgive me and help
[1:01:54] me then about three hours later he wakes
[1:01:58] me up and he says well you forgot this
[1:02:02] you ain't never done that you never had
[1:02:04] him to wake you up
[1:02:05] remind you you know well sometimes
[1:02:12] that's why I get a sermon and it reminds
[1:02:14] me all right what do you see what I'm
[1:02:16] talking about you can take brother
[1:02:20] Brandon's message and make it say what
[1:02:22] you want it to say because they just
[1:02:25] gave you a quote that brother Branham
[1:02:28] says Calvinism and Arminianism is wrong
[1:02:33] then it gave you a quote where he said
[1:02:36] that they didn't contradict each other
[1:02:39] didn't give you one where he said that
[1:02:41] confirmed each other
[1:02:49] tell not trying to live a Christian life
[1:02:51] that's that's always been my pet peeve
[1:02:54] to say people say you know that they
[1:02:57] trying to brother they're trying to get
[1:02:58] you to little critter now he's trying to
[1:03:00] get me to do that like Fred Hooper said
[1:03:02] years ago you remember when that
[1:03:04] happened down there with the Jim Jones
[1:03:05] and the things that a little brother
[1:03:06] Fred hope we used to go to church and we
[1:03:08] start work one day and this man come up
[1:03:10] and he said the only was talking about
[1:03:12] the Jim Jones situation and he looked at
[1:03:14] Fred and he said his brother Dale ever
[1:03:17] want you to kill yourself he said ever
[1:03:19] service he said he tries to get me into
[1:03:24] whoever serviced to kill myself and live
[1:03:27] a Christian life alright that should be
[1:03:31] our goal see we expect God to take care
[1:03:36] of us like tons of troubles like we are
[1:03:38] now we expect God you know the world and
[1:03:40] all to take care of us and help us
[1:03:42] that's good
[1:03:44] but what if he's expecting us to move a
[1:03:49] little closer come a little closer to
[1:03:53] him you know all of these things serve
[1:03:57] him more honor him more especially yes I
[1:04:03] see do you have to make yourself do
[1:04:07] things do you have to make yourself do
[1:04:13] them see then you're trying to lean
[1:04:19] towards Arminianism you're trying to
[1:04:22] find some form of works that will save
[1:04:25] you work will never save you my brother
[1:04:31] Brennan said you can have what you women
[1:04:34] there's not cause you got long hair and
[1:04:36] long dresses maybe he didn't make the
[1:04:40] statement I'll make it you could you
[1:04:41] didn't get that Crystal Gayle ever what
[1:04:43] her name is and let her walk down
[1:04:44] through here and her hair is gonna run
[1:04:49] but does that mean she saved no well she
[1:04:55] don't go to hire does that mean you're
[1:04:58] safe because you don't got your heart
[1:05:02] if it is your Calvinists do you
[1:05:07] understand this if you think that you
[1:05:14] can do something or not not do it and
[1:05:17] God would save you or or whatever if
[1:05:19] that's what you're thinking then you're
[1:05:21] trying to to bring some forth and that
[1:05:23] won't work
[1:05:24] I'm trying to bring a boat to a point I
[1:05:27] think we order to live a Christian life
[1:05:30] I'm gonna state this way but I hope you
[1:05:33] and always have made that statement
[1:05:34] about brother Brown never had to come to
[1:05:37] teach the women and not cut to her and
[1:05:39] the close to her you Pentecostals now
[1:05:42] come on get on with it I'm 80 years old
[1:05:46] but I didn't come through Pentecost
[1:05:47] but you know yourself the Pentecostals
[1:05:49] they they've believed in that long dress
[1:05:51] long hair and men with the long sleeves
[1:05:53] and the nothing they was dire and that
[1:05:56] was robbed brother branham didn't have
[1:05:57] to come to straighten us out on the fact
[1:06:00] of what we thought that meant
[1:06:02] it's where he came he came to set in
[1:06:06] order all of those things to show us
[1:06:09] that it was not a Christian because that
[1:06:12] we had long higher but to show us that
[1:06:18] it if that if we do that by the love of
[1:06:22] God within our heart then the higher and
[1:06:27] all is the honor and glory see that way
[1:06:35] we're not legalist we're not trying to
[1:06:40] be saved
[1:06:47] I think if you'd agree with about the
[1:06:49] biggest portion of our lives and then we
[1:06:50] try to get out of being saved the way
[1:06:54] we've acted now at least right but you
[1:06:59] see Church what is it so you never chose
[1:07:08] him let me get to this part of the
[1:07:11] message just a little bit you never
[1:07:13] chosen him he chose you
[1:07:15] yeah but but but brother Dale I chose
[1:07:17] God I pray that cry I've tried to
[1:07:19] explain that here we go over here for a
[1:07:22] little while and then over here for a
[1:07:23] little while all right
[1:07:26] you cried and you prayed and you saw God
[1:07:31] the Bible didn't tell you you're wrong
[1:07:34] by doing that but then it said you never
[1:07:38] saw God at any time now you said wait a
[1:07:41] minute
[1:07:41] now you're over here one time and you're
[1:07:43] over here one time well why don't you
[1:07:44] put him together he chose you the way I
[1:07:53] like it really is the way the scripture
[1:07:55] says that man that's the title we'll use
[1:07:59] for a while he's chosen us in him whose
[1:08:05] to him that looks like there's a person
[1:08:11] standing there that looks like there was
[1:08:16] a person accepted and now you're in that
[1:08:19] person and you're accepted we don't want
[1:08:24] that struggle chosen us in him who Jesus
[1:08:30] Christ you see we're not trying to tear
[1:08:38] engines we're not you know not trying to
[1:08:40] be but if we get into the predestination
[1:08:42] in the correct order and bring it back
[1:08:44] all the way to where you can get to the
[1:08:46] mind and then look at that from the mind
[1:08:48] and maybe it'll help us to understand
[1:08:54] but what about it
[1:08:58] what is your goal now remember if he
[1:09:04] chose me I didn't having to do with it
[1:09:08] that's what I'm trying to explain I'm
[1:09:10] trying to be human to where you won't
[1:09:12] misunderstand and say well I don't
[1:09:14] believe this and I don't believe that I
[1:09:15] wanted to I believe that you saw God
[1:09:21] because I did I cried and prayed and
[1:09:24] fasted and and done everything and tried
[1:09:27] for that and gotten away from the world
[1:09:32] and the bad distant even this that much
[1:09:35] in the doctrine of the Baptist Church
[1:09:36] that I didn't drink didn't smoke didn't
[1:09:38] shoot and do those things I didn't have
[1:09:42] to quit that when I come into message
[1:09:46] come on you know yourself what I'm
[1:09:48] talking about
[1:09:49] most people say when I come into the
[1:09:51] message I quit drinking I quit you know
[1:09:53] I didn't have to because I believed it's
[1:09:57] a Baptist war to be a Christian I
[1:10:02] believe that one doesn't the Baptist
[1:10:04] Church were little Christian huh I
[1:10:05] didn't do it I didn't say that I said I
[1:10:08] believed in it that's why that one of
[1:10:14] these days you will wake up and realize
[1:10:16] that brother Dale is try this best to do
[1:10:18] one thing I've never tried to beat you
[1:10:20] in to believe in something I've never
[1:10:23] tried to make you believe in anything in
[1:10:27] Jesus Christ I've tried to make it to
[1:10:30] the basis that it is in the Word of God
[1:10:32] for you and me and it's in there in the
[1:10:35] correct order
[1:10:36] arminianism is Dyer Calvinism is there
[1:10:39] bring them together bring them together
[1:10:43] to word that we can see Christianity and
[1:10:46] it really is it won't be a hard life to
[1:10:53] live
[1:10:59] that's what I told the people in this
[1:11:00] message they told me said what do you
[1:11:02] mean you seeking the Lord I said I've
[1:11:04] been seeking the Lord two years and they
[1:11:05] found him yet
[1:11:06] I said that's after coming in the
[1:11:07] message will you believe the masses I
[1:11:10] see I think so-called I read six books
[1:11:12] and listened to tapes in one day you
[1:11:14] ever tried it I didn't mean it
[1:11:16] sarcastically I mean it's the truth
[1:11:18] I put my life dedicated it to study in
[1:11:21] this message that was all I had that was
[1:11:26] all my desires brother Kali can tell you
[1:11:30] I had a good boss and a good job and and
[1:11:34] everything and I can just set up there
[1:11:35] with him half the night he's up by
[1:11:39] rolling tires and meeting him talking
[1:11:41] about the Lord and he's rolling tires
[1:11:43] and stacking them up at a good time what
[1:11:50] you see Church I'm not trying to appease
[1:11:55] God I never did dad I just didn't want
[1:12:04] to smoke I didn't want to drink I didn't
[1:12:09] want to do those things
[1:12:11] why because I believed if I was going to
[1:12:14] be a Christian the first thing I said
[1:12:17] when I was 18 years old and you know I
[1:12:21] said well if if I'm gonna be a Christian
[1:12:23] I need to know what the Bible said so I
[1:12:25] set out to read it and I admit when I
[1:12:30] got to those things that were you good
[1:12:33] 1,400 times that it said so and so begat
[1:12:36] so and so and so and so begat so and so
[1:12:39] you'll run into them you ain't you ain't
[1:12:42] read the Bible through you can't read
[1:12:44] the Bible through well you don't know
[1:12:45] you never read it through you're
[1:12:49] laughing about it now because you
[1:12:50] realizes that's what you read that so
[1:12:53] once over got sunset songs over God's
[1:12:55] run so now I got tired of that but all
[1:12:58] at once one day right in the middle of
[1:13:00] it you know one of those 10 times
[1:13:02] reading their twenty all at once they
[1:13:04] was just something that was placed in
[1:13:06] there and it's like heaven wow look what
[1:13:11] I demystified have turned over and had
[1:13:13] the cat
[1:13:13] than reading this one so we got Chandra
[1:13:15] so I slowed down and I read the Bible
[1:13:19] and I tried to read it for myself
[1:13:21] because if I don't believe in
[1:13:23] Christianity for myself I was gonna
[1:13:25] believe in it in the Word of God I did I
[1:13:28] tried to do that and my wife's you can
[1:13:31] verify the point I told her one day I
[1:13:33] said look like to me there's gonna be
[1:13:34] two prophets coming for the end of the
[1:13:36] world I was a bad just reading that out
[1:13:39] of the Bible cause I had Malachi thread
[1:13:41] Malachi 4
[1:13:42] well I wouldn't read through that I
[1:13:44] didn't see nothing well okay I'm not
[1:13:46] going off on you I'm just saying that's
[1:13:48] what happened to me then I read and
[1:13:51] heard it look like who here's one coming
[1:13:52] and look like over here's another one
[1:13:54] coming I told you about it when brother
[1:13:58] Moe got to talking to me about a prophet
[1:13:59] I said cuz I was kind of little bit
[1:14:02] tricky stew and he started telling me
[1:14:05] about a prophet and he was talking about
[1:14:06] Malachi forward I said well okay explain
[1:14:08] Malachi 3 well I thank God I didn't have
[1:14:12] to run up on somebody didn't know what
[1:14:14] I'm talking about
[1:14:15] I'd run up on a man and note exactly he
[1:14:17] quoted exactly straight through and he
[1:14:19] said this is Luke 1:17 and this is this
[1:14:22] and I said come on see once he got
[1:14:25] through explaining Luke and explaining
[1:14:28] those things about the coming of Elijah
[1:14:34] sound was well settled I was in the word
[1:14:38] I had my answer of two prophets looking
[1:14:45] forward to one coming but looking and
[1:14:47] seeing the other had already come I
[1:14:51] didn't have any trouble with those
[1:14:54] things you know why cuz I'd read the
[1:14:56] Word of God well how many times have we
[1:14:59] put our lives on the basis of how much
[1:15:01] we've read it's like I said if I was
[1:15:08] gonna be a Christian I thought all to
[1:15:09] know what the Bible said yeah
[1:15:11] shouldn't that be what it is well I
[1:15:14] begin to read it to see what it was I've
[1:15:18] told you so you get into this message in
[1:15:21] and you mentioned adoption then this
[1:15:23] messiness just as how Buddhists about it
[1:15:25] or predestinate
[1:15:27] has really gone off the other imagine
[1:15:29] divorce is really man you just out you
[1:15:31] nobody knows anything about all these
[1:15:33] thing well I know a lot about a lot of
[1:15:38] things for I come in this message cuz
[1:15:44] I'd studied it over and over then what
[1:15:51] was you trying to be Armenian or
[1:15:53] Calvinist matter of fact I didn't even
[1:15:57] know what neither one of them men I
[1:15:58] think that about the basis of all those
[1:16:00] sitting here biggest fortunate people
[1:16:01] don't even know Armenian of Calvinism
[1:16:03] you say it like anything what is it one
[1:16:09] of them is Calvinism it's trying to find
[1:16:13] some beautiful thing or something you
[1:16:15] don't or didn't do or something that's
[1:16:17] that the other some reason for God to
[1:16:18] save you our meaning is omit some works
[1:16:21] you've done thinking that's what made it
[1:16:23] to where God would save you but both of
[1:16:27] them is wrong that away we'll put them
[1:16:29] together what do you got put them
[1:16:34] together you got a beautiful story of
[1:16:35] the plan of salvation that God gave you
[1:16:41] and I an opportunity chosen us in him
[1:16:49] who him the word he said well that meant
[1:16:57] this person accepted this person over
[1:16:59] here and if within that person why no no
[1:17:02] don't don't get into that's your going
[1:17:05] into your your regard deals at the end
[1:17:09] and stuff like I don't do that just
[1:17:12] think about it but I ask you one time
[1:17:18] why did he save you
[1:17:21] well he saved me cars are so good what's
[1:17:24] the I'll just tell you right up front
[1:17:26] that ain't salvation nothing like you
[1:17:28] missed it I'm just serious I think you
[1:17:30] missed it I think you need to get saved
[1:17:32] Oh no matter how you ready Rhetta no
[1:17:35] major oh you're beating on me hard
[1:17:36] you're saying that I ain't say you
[1:17:38] that's what one brother said
[1:17:40] I said no brother I didn't say that you
[1:17:45] told them my ones I didn't say that I
[1:17:51] said if you act like that you're proving
[1:17:55] you ain't safe that's now you quote me
[1:17:57] riding I don't care if I act like the
[1:18:01] devil then I know who I belong to well
[1:18:07] what a wonderful opportunity to be able
[1:18:09] to understand these things maybe that
[1:18:14] encourage you to read a lot more the
[1:18:16] message you know encourage you to read
[1:18:23] and listen to a lot of types and get a
[1:18:25] good understanding of what's being say
[1:18:27] it because I think for certain if
[1:18:33] anybody should have the right maybe I
[1:18:36] don't shouldn't say this but better way
[1:18:38] but if anybody has a right to understand
[1:18:40] the Word of God it should be the people
[1:18:42] of this message I don't mean this cause
[1:18:45] you read it I mean because of why you're
[1:18:47] reading it at least some of that dwelt
[1:18:49] in it some of that caught in to us and
[1:18:51] hung on you know like I said how many of
[1:18:56] you would have talked about Armenian and
[1:18:58] Calvinism as I have today afterward that
[1:19:00] I can stand here and take a profit and
[1:19:02] say he's right but say that he said
[1:19:05] Armenian and Calvinism was wrong then he
[1:19:08] said they don't contradict each other
[1:19:10] then he said they confirm each other you
[1:19:17] show our master no cause you see if
[1:19:23] you'll just wait on God you'll just ask
[1:19:27] him and wait on him he'll come out and
[1:19:31] explain it to you they'll all come to
[1:19:34] the right place and you'll see that way
[1:19:39] Lord forgive me because I have had
[1:19:41] Armenian ideas I have had Calvinistic
[1:19:43] ideas I don't have to tear it out of the
[1:19:47] Bible that's what a brother told me one
[1:19:50] time he's talking about something he
[1:19:51] said they will take that out of the
[1:19:53] Bible
[1:19:54] I said give me your Bible cause you
[1:20:02] don't think it ought to be in there
[1:20:03] don't take it out give me your Bible he
[1:20:06] wouldn't do with it he knew me I don't
[1:20:09] take it out
[1:20:11] I'd have been glad to borrowed him
[1:20:13] another $50 $100 Bible replace it but I
[1:20:16] was gonna take that out of that Bible
[1:20:17] called he said it wouldn't be in there I
[1:20:20] was doing it call to him what you see we
[1:20:28] try to make things to be what we want
[1:20:30] him to be instead of letting it be what
[1:20:35] he says it is chosen us in him the word
[1:20:44] and he chose us before the foundation of
[1:20:47] the world yeah but now wait a minute you
[1:20:54] getting it to a little bit too foreign
[1:20:55] Calvinism well if we don't act and live
[1:21:00] like our Christian duty in our life here
[1:21:02] now we have no right to say we're
[1:21:04] Christians right we are no right to say
[1:21:11] we're Christians if we don't act like it
[1:21:19] see Paul then he's telling you what God
[1:21:23] saw in Abraham James is taking the same
[1:21:30] thing and explaining what man sees and
[1:21:37] put it together and you got the
[1:21:40] Christian experience of living for Jesus
[1:21:42] Christ every day you live and having a
[1:21:44] wonderful time about it then your fears
[1:21:48] and things are gone Rodell did you have
[1:21:51] any fear when this came on us with
[1:21:59] why because they ain't nothing they can
[1:22:01] do and what I could put you in jail any
[1:22:04] minute brother branham's wonder said it
[1:22:08] I love it
[1:22:09] he said you can't get sick unless God
[1:22:12] lets you you heard that one
[1:22:14] he said he allows it to come on here and
[1:22:19] he said this for our good but he says
[1:22:24] now he ain't gonna let it go too far
[1:22:31] what do you pray then brother Dale I
[1:22:33] pray lord help all these people around
[1:22:36] the world you promised the little bride
[1:22:42] that you'd be with her
[1:22:45] nothing wouldn't be able to conquer us
[1:22:47] you promised so believe that Lord help
[1:22:52] these poor old people of the world
[1:22:53] you don't ever pray for them lord help
[1:22:57] these poor little people around the
[1:22:59] world
[1:23:00] the trapped are dying and what about it
[1:23:10] okay I hope you get the point
[1:23:12] so where's no native trying to move on
[1:23:13] me and I'll get next week that's one
[1:23:16] thing about preaching you can just carry
[1:23:19] it on to the next service and don't go
[1:23:21] again but do you understand think about
[1:23:28] it are we Armenian are we Calvinist are
[1:23:37] can we take the truth they were
[1:23:41] presented passo Paul brought the truth
[1:23:44] about salvation James brought the truth
[1:23:49] about salvation we try to figure them
[1:23:51] out and we have them fighting each other
[1:23:53] they are not fighting each other
[1:23:55] Paul is explaining salvation as the gift
[1:23:59] of God that your predestinated that
[1:24:06] you're chosen in him not of him
[1:24:11] you're chosen in him well who was doing
[1:24:16] the choosing who to God himself
[1:24:22] you don't have to have another person to
[1:24:24] add up to were chosen in him who in God
[1:24:33] what about that well that means I can go
[1:24:35] I do what I want to now you're proving
[1:24:37] that you're lost you're leaning to your
[1:24:41] Calvinistic form and you're proving
[1:24:43] you're lost let us take the truth of all
[1:24:51] of it and bring it together that's why I
[1:24:53] love this message you know yourself
[1:24:58] I'm not saying it and Ron why we're
[1:25:00] saying it in a rally you know yourself
[1:25:02] you can read one thing run around and
[1:25:03] say yes and the next day you'll read
[1:25:05] something sound like it's different if
[1:25:09] you admit it you used to do that with a
[1:25:10] Bible you used to read this in the Bible
[1:25:12] and then you'd read this in the Bible
[1:25:14] and you had it contradictory but then
[1:25:17] come to find out it's both of them is
[1:25:18] telling the truth
[1:25:19] now it takes a revelation now that takes
[1:25:23] an understanding to come together
[1:25:29] salvation is of the Lord Jonah - or not
[1:25:33] we get into predestination just remember
[1:25:36] this one time he predestinated by
[1:25:39] foreknowledge but now you've got some
[1:25:43] calling an election we'll have to
[1:25:45] eventually get into calling an election
[1:25:58] that's where we look at it we thank
[1:26:00] predestination well that this means
[1:26:02] predetermined that's it if he
[1:26:06] predetermined me before the world I can
[1:26:08] be saved if he didn't I can't be then
[1:26:11] your prophet said you're wrong he said
[1:26:15] he didn't prove didn't choose by his own
[1:26:20] choosing city chose race for knowledge
[1:26:28] what you don't want then according to
[1:26:31] that now let's just make one little
[1:26:32] thing and I'll quit according to that
[1:26:36] then let me be a little bit on the
[1:26:40] Armenian side and this say I thank God
[1:26:46] that he has revealed its Word to us and
[1:26:48] we can do and realize that it's not what
[1:26:51] we do or don't do but yet if we're
[1:26:56] Christians we will do and not and then
[1:27:04] that'll make it come out to the rabbis
[1:27:06] and then we'll realize that hey it is a
[1:27:12] hall of grace but we don't want to make
[1:27:15] it disgrace and bring it to a baptist
[1:27:18] once saved always saved
[1:27:21] I come through there I know the doctrine
[1:27:25] but I'm not throwing off on them because
[1:27:29] that's what we thought and I'm true I
[1:27:34] believe it what's truly born again
[1:27:36] you're truly born again I believe in it
[1:27:38] I believe the Baptist had it right they
[1:27:40] just didn't know how to explain it
[1:27:42] this Baptist was predestination or do
[1:27:45] you know her or not so that's really
[1:27:47] technically whether the Baptist split
[1:27:49] over two brothers that was preaching on
[1:27:51] predestination and it divided the
[1:27:54] Baptist Church up in a descent it never
[1:27:56] Direction me but they had truth those
[1:28:00] people had truth I mean do we look at
[1:28:06] Martin Luther as
[1:28:08] fact that he was so confused about
[1:28:10] everything but God gave him one little
[1:28:12] thing the just shall live by faith
[1:28:17] no if you want to come to the house I'll
[1:28:20] see if I can find I'll find what John
[1:28:22] Wesley and Newt they're both was
[1:28:24] teaching things that we think brother
[1:28:27] Brandon was the one that started
[1:28:28] teaching them no they were teaching
[1:28:33] truth back down through there in a lot
[1:28:35] of areas but we want the truth they took
[1:28:42] this message to bring the truth this
[1:28:45] message puts together Arminianism in
[1:28:47] Calvinism and this brings it in a
[1:28:49] beautiful picture and we say thank you
[1:28:52] Lord for saving us now I ain't trying to
[1:28:57] work nothing out but I'm trying to just
[1:28:58] do one time let me be what I'm supposed
[1:29:00] to be and forgive me when I fail because
[1:29:06] I'm gonna do it
[1:29:09] Bank on these things
[1:29:11] let's Dan come on musician you want to
[1:29:19] study a little bit study on
[1:29:20] predestination and think about
[1:29:29] but you just remember it all starts from
[1:29:36] chosen in him starts there some reason
[1:29:45] that he chose you why don't you search
[1:29:51] for there's some reason I like it this
[1:29:59] way there's a reason for you women don't
[1:30:01] have to worry about preaching so that
[1:30:03] solves that right you don't worry about
[1:30:08] it comes from women not smoke sprees so
[1:30:11] you solve that well I find a woman I'd
[1:30:14] be happy I say thank you Lord at least I
[1:30:17] know once I got out to preach go seek
[1:30:20] when you come through Pentecost do you
[1:30:21] had a bunch other it was preaching and
[1:30:23] everything out and that's alright I'm
[1:30:25] not though - but you think there's some
[1:30:33] reason that you're here today well I
[1:30:41] guess we got up and I go to church
[1:30:42] that's good there's some reason I like
[1:30:49] what the Prophet said he said when the
[1:30:51] bride realized who she is and what she's
[1:30:55] here for
[1:30:56] he said she'll be an invincible army you
[1:31:01] just realize somebody chose me I didn't
[1:31:04] choose him he chose me he had a reason
[1:31:09] because one of these days you see I'm
[1:31:11] going to preach on a predestinated
[1:31:15] eternal gift that'll go with this a
[1:31:22] predestinated eternal
[1:31:29] gift
[1:31:34] what is eternal life it's through Jesus
[1:31:39] Christ
[1:31:40] and he's the word well we got ready oh
