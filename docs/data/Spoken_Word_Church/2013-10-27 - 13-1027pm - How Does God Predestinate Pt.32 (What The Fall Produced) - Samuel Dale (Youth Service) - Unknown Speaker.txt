everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we read this morning from romans and then we'll read from genesis 3 and try to get right on into the message um there's been kind of a straightening up or whatever you want to call it of what it is about the baby shower so everybody listen that was given this morning and and then the things has been added to it but there will be a baby shower on the 24th of november on the sunday afternoon after the the evening service all right now sister anna is registered at babies or us now register it was announced this morning registered walmart but not now listen she's registered at babies or us okay but if you want to get gifts cards from walmart or target that would be fine she's not registered at target in walmart she's registered at uh babies are us and then if you want to get some gift cards and things you know from walmart or target that's fine all right so we make sure and get that announced where that will we'll get it in the right order so it'll do it amen i hope you enjoyed this morning i got pretty hard and stern and stiff but uh i was thinking about it sitting in there and i thought well you know maybe i shouldn't use such a hard word as i use to try to get you to think about it but you know we say things and you say well you shouldn't say a lot of things in front of the kids then you send your kids to sex education at school and they're going to learn a whole lot more than what i've said in a whole lot of different words and a whole lot of different illustrations that's right it's going to be given to them but yet you don't get upset at them but you know you think well i i do the best i can but i'm just human and i know that i a lot of times i uh say things harsh but there's one thing about it it's come from a heart of love you know i love you and i hope you love me know that i don't like to be a lot of times what i am sometimes i have to come out and rebuke and do things you know and i don't like that but i try to do it for the honor and glory of the lord so as long as you love me you'll look over my faults and failures all right if you don't look over my faults and failures you don't love me okay that's a pretty good weapon i'm glad i thought of that but we just we'll try to take up the message and carry on i was aiming at this try to finish a whole lot into that message but we'll try to put it together with the afternoon message and uh you know carry this thought on of what we're trying to do is cover some things in the scriptures about what happened in the garden and the things like that and just taking the verses and a comment from brother branham about it and trying to look into this but now remember we're still talking about predestination we're still talking about predestination looking back to foreknowledge for knowledge being first all right then predestination well you couldn't begin predestination until we started the early journey well then you can see that god knew what was going to happen in the garden that's what i'm trying to cover to get you to look at is what happened in the garden is it's god fulfilling his predestinated plan he said well that means god planned it no god knew before knowledge all right so he knew what would take place it's not pulling anything over on him but he's there to make sure that everything works good all right but let's pray father we thank you we love you and we ask you now to just be with us lord and forgive us sometimes when do we speak harsh and firm and say words maybe we shouldn't say as a preacher to use the word stupid or crazy or something but lord i'm just trying now to do the best i can and and you just put that to my ignorance of not knowing any better but yet the people can go and look at it and they they can make a lot of fun and light about the way that i say things but lord all i want to know is it the truth if it's not the truth i want to know because my whole soul life and everything is built up on one thing and that is that you brought us a message it's up to us to believe it and not to just believe it but to bring it into manifestation so lord we just ask you to help us and guide us now and keep us and father just let your light shine in each one of our hearts and lives those that are not here maybe when they hear it on tape they can finish out the parts of the message lord and you know the reasons why that sometimes we're not here so that's into your hands we love you and we thank you god each one of us now in jesus name amen romans 8. now forgive us if we get a little up and down this afternoon and juggling messages because you know we've we've got uh quite a bit to go and uh try not to say too much to line back up but just enough for us to carry on the thought all right romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did no for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren more to whom he did predestinate than he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall they we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us when we go back to genesis and we'll begin in the third chapter i think we went up to the 13th verse all right and we got down coming in part of that and we now we want to cover just a little bit and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast to the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thy shall bruise his heel unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception as we were talking about this morning now why would it be going to the sorrow and the conception if it's just a unbelief of a former eating an apple as an attribute i mean why would these things be here unto the woman why would it not say unto the woman i'll greatly multiply thy bowel movement that's what you'd have to say it was an apple all right but no see i will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he said because dies hearken unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thy shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days without life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee and thy shall eat the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust thou art and it does shalt thou return and adam called his wife's name eve now that was the first time in the bible she received a name now look at the definition because she was the mother of all living all right now there's not anything else to be involved see unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god makes coats of skin and clothed them and the lord god said behold a woman has now become excuse me behold a man has now become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also over the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground for which he was taken so he drove drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cerebellums and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life you may be seated to lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we covered this morning got down to the part of talking about where that eve said the serpent beguiled me and i said we'd run back over this a little bit this afternoon you know and then carry our thought on so now the word beguiled it means to beguile it means to to deceive to be beguiled you remember i said this morning that uh it's translated there into it's only used uh 12 times in the uh no it's only used four times and it's used 12 times translated as the word deceived so deceived and beguiled would be the same word see that you're coming forth and we gave the scriptures and all and then we went on through beguile like it said to eve in second corinthians 11 3 that lest satan you know by any means beguiled eve because you and i deceive us be god because deceived means to beguile or to deceived all right being used and beguiled we beguiled means to deceive deceived means to beguile all right then what are we coming to we're coming to the point that i asked this morning why would the prophet and we'll read it in a minute why would he use the word defiled when when beguiled means to deceive and deceive means to beguile why would he use the word defiled we'll read that in a moment but why would he do it like that and he says the word begal means to you know to defile all right now if the word means to defile by the definition of the prophet he's given us the scriptural definition which is greater than to just say beguile means to deceive he's going into the deeper points of understanding he knows what he's talking about right so we believe that but then the eve said the serpent beguiled me all right you remember right at the end we were trying to bring down the point that it says the serpent beguiled well that was the part of eve that was being beguiled was part her you called it of through the the mind of satan you know coming through the beast to be using it because there's a difference between the serpent and the beast so the serpent beguiled her the devil beguiled eve all right but he could not have any natural children he has no seed he could not have any intercourse etc with eve he knew he couldn't do that so what did he do he used the beast all right using the beast to talk to he was able to beguile eve all right getting her to think the wrong things then the prophet says the word because means to defile okay let's see if i can grab that in a hurry uh go over to number go to number 10 brother what i said we're gonna have to jump back and forth this afternoon let's look at it and we'll see why the prophet said that the word beguile means to defile uh the word defile it means to be unclean become unclean become impure to be become unclean sexually religiously ceremonially something more than just the deceiving of the mind that said this morning then we talk about the sin in the garden as being unbelief well amen we believe that but what was the attribute or the physical happening that took place so you say well why do we need to know that it's this well why do we need to know that jesus had to come through a wound he had to be a kinsman redeemer didn't he all right but see think about it then it means to defile oneself means to be defiled sexually by idolatry it means to be recalled regarded as unclean see it's a a word the word beguile can cover the the reasoning factors you know the part of us we call the the second realm whether you want to call it soul or call it spirit it is the second realm that has the memory reason constant effect that's what satan done the serpent he came through that all right but then the beast came into being of what took place and he defiled eve he defiled the body i hope we have time to get to it he realized that what he really caused was death and we can tie it all back together listening last night to brother branham talking about it and if you talk about unbelief he said death always follows unbelief all right now we probably might not get that far but we'll try to to do something uh aaron would you come up and click cause we need at least a little air all right but you see what i'm talking about so what we were talking about this morning ending it up talking about the beast was used to defile the serpent the talking the the doings beguiled her so her whole being was defiled right brother said you know beguile means to defile all right he's right because what happened there was the serpent is satan he has no way to do anything wrong that way physically so he beguiled her mind and got her to thinking wrong then the beast was able to be used to defile her and then it odd these old bodies then like i said if it was apple one of the bodies condemned wasn't always something defile in the body one one and always well because that's what went wrong it brought death into the human race so we already know there's something wrong with that right but did you follow what it's talking about if he did we can jump over now think about it we've read this one before so we won't have to use it but brother branham said it in the future home he said god never cursed adam said he never cursed eve he cursed the beast we read that in the scripture he cursed the devil the serpent we can read that connecting two scriptures there we said he never cursed eve now i told you that i'd like to preach about an hour and a half or two hours on why it says the lord god spoke that we just read a moment ago jehovah elohim which means like a father with his family the eternal god created mankind and was come had come down to worship you know to be worshiped the fellowship with mankind all right in being the fellowship with mankind then he would be kept as lord god and he didn't throw us away so he didn't curse adam he never cursed eve remember to put this cough drop in because i hollered too much this morning you remember the little boy the preacher said my throat short i can't hardly talk and the little boy said you hotter'd you know hollered in the church and said the lord don't like for you to holler in the church and that was why the preacher had the bad throat so maybe i'll holler too much all right and see while i'm at it i said something about people going out last week and i asked you to be respectable to wait until the scripture was through reading then go out i've never been against anybody going to the bathroom you need to go you go to the bathroom i've never been against anybody that has a problem with diabetics or something that you have to do but why don't you simply put your peppermint candy in your pocket and slip it in your mouth you know i wouldn't say a thing if you come and told me that well i've got to have water you know ever so often well i wouldn't say a thing to see you just take it in a little sip but don't turn it up and google it that's what everybody love it look look hear some of you been here and hear you sneeze i get so tickled at that you're supposed to stifle a sneeze because i too that means everybody in the building just got a good bath in my germs you snout at you but you ain't gonna do it because you've done it all your life that's the ego okay get off of it brother dale that stirs this old boy up to see our egos and you're not going to take correction but i ain't said a word about anybody going to the bathroom i ain't said a word about anybody having to put a piece of peppermint candy in their mouth because that they were a diabetic or something they never been that away i ain't that away and i'm not going to be that way sometimes when i talk it sounds like that's what i'm doing but you just remember i just put a cough drop in there was a day i was against putting anything in your mouth it was a day i wouldn't in no way put a cough drop in but it's either put the cough drop in or i can't preach and if you can't exist without having to go to the bathroom all i ask you to do is not do it while the scripture is being dread i was trying to be nice about it just to do that but that's all right i know i the way i am i'm sorry but listen now get back to the point you ever thought about it wade had it wednesday night he didn't curse adam and he didn't curse eve right right that's where brother brown gave it future home he could pull it up you pull up number six you know two words to make sure that people can read it he didn't curse adam and he didn't curse eve he might have done the same things no but he didn't he didn't curse eve but said adam would be her ruler and thanks all right that's paragraph 325 the future home have you ever thought about why they didn't get cursed now i won't get through this evening without what i got but we'll go as far as we can go you ever thought about why they didn't get cursed you see adam had eternal life in his soul according to blasphemous names right all right brother brown said especially into adam he gave him eternal life all right how could he curse eternal life you mean god was going to come down and because man done wrong he come down and cursed the very beginning of mankind cursed adam no he made an atonement for him we'll get to that after a while he made a covering he knew that's what he's going to do because adam and eve in the garden and satan the beast etc was going to help god bring out his plan and finish it of being a savior a healer a deliverer et cetera all by his foreknowledge of predestination but if he to curse adam he'd have been cursing his own self i'd write that down i thought lord i got to cover that if he'd accursed adam the bible said adam was the son of god brother branham blasphemius name said adam had eternal life in his soul his inner being god's own life he said well how could he curse him all right so he didn't curse eve because i believe she had eternal life in her soul all right but he could curse the beast he could curse the serpent he could put the snake on his belly he could i mean the beast on his belly to make a snake he could curse the serpent which is satan because he didn't have eternal life wade was covering our wednesday how could he curse sarah that's right how could goss curse sarah why because she was part of abraham how could he curse eve because she was a part of adam what about it he was their father their creator and he couldn't curse eve he couldn't curse adam because they had eternal life let's read this one now go ahead with number seven let's just read this one sir as we would see jesus 1964 304 paragraph 68-69 and sarah tried to deny it but being that she was part of abraham her unbelief would have condemned her but god could not take her because she was a part of abraham the church would have been condemned long ago but it's part of christ he never cursed adam he never cursed eve because they had eternal life he can't give you eternal life and curse you we can be children that are disobedient and he can let things come to us and line us up and give us weapons but you never reject us right i'm looking back in the garden and seeing that point see he would have been cursing himself if he'd give you the new birth how can he curse you yeah brother dale i just feel like that i'm just i'm i'm just condemned for being we may be carrying life things that we went through that are not i've done we maybe carry the marks of that but just remember you'll never be cursed why i want to get back to it later the reason i'm not using the scripture but we just read the scripture there where he promised to see to the woman to come i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman i want to get onto that on the whole message but i want you to think about it he never cursed adam and eve because they were part of him all we got to do is make sure that we have him in us then we don't have to worry about a fall a curse or anything we don't have to be concerned about it all right so you get to point now and we'll move on into the afternoon's message or or get you know part of it he cursed the serpent we'll have to get over in another scripture where it covers and and you know the the uh the serpent then was made uh i mean the the beast was made of snake the beast was cursed on the bases that it was made of snake all right made a reptile but you know what that beast as i said was an animal and it wasn't wrong itself but it was used to do something wrong god said all right animal he was used now animal will be used for the atonement all of those animals back there were sacrificed on the altar before god to make an atonement because animal was the cause and animal being that point all right now in case you get messed up in it just remember the point that he can call the beast the serpent he could be speaking straight to satan and call him the serpent you get over in the book of revelations and he talks about that old serpent the devil he can use those words as serpent and beast that's why it's called the seed of the serpent it wasn't called the seed of the beast even though the seed of the beast is what polluted the human race defiled it but the seed of the serpent was the unbelief that was given to eve but it'll all be called the seed of the serpent i'll get back to the message on that later or not in today but see putting it together we see that eve was beguiled by the serpent the bible would say and then we can say e was defiled by the serpent because you know what you're talking about see satan had no ability to defile ever he could be beguiler or deceiver but there had to be an attribute of that unbelief and that goes through to show you know what's taking place all right now let's jump over into the message a little further to where we can get an understanding without having to preach two different messages so forgive me i want you to think about something and there's many reasons to get you to think on this point one reason is for me to try to get to you an understanding of how real god is people that well god is a spirit we believe that i believe that that's bible but how real is your god we just read in our scripture reading there that it says god made coats of skin for adam and eve now what do you think he got them coats of skins well he just created him well if he created him are you just making him a creator to create the skins now brother branham said he killed those animals most people would say well my god is not real like that well you need another god because you're out of the bible remember the prophet do you need these he said we were going out of the garden he said those bloody skins flopping on their legs they were bloody did god create bloody skins no he killed the animals showing the first atonement that was made was an animal sacrifice all right or we write then what we were talking about animal was used in the wrong act now it's going to be used as an atonement so that don't look too bad to the animals does it you know he's the god of the animals as well as he's the god of the human being he loves those animals and things he took the skins off of those animals and he made an atonement he said but i just don't brother dale i just don't go along with you that god said what kind of a god do you have i'm just honest well god it's just a spirit see that's our our understanding of what we think has figured out the bible don't you believe the bible yeah what the same bible says heaven is my throne earth is my footstool so he's got a bottom he can sit down on the throne and the earth is his footsteps he's got feet the bible talks about the heart of god the bible talks about him being the head it talks about the arms it talks about the eyes the mouth the snow the nose remember my nostrils are fully he talks about being able to hear but brother tale he's just a spirit all right the doctrine came in the message years ago around the message people that god was just like the wind just floating around so brother branham is the one that said these things he said he's not like to win he said god is a being we could go through a long lengthy talk about that couldn't we how that moses saw the back part of a man he said in the same back that later was walking on the shores of galilee one of them's a theophany the other one is a literal person what do you think god looked like jesus why because he's his father and i told you when we get to heaven it's not going to be a father over here a holy ghost over here and a jesus here we're going to see him and know who he is because i believe in real god and when i read here that the prophet said that god killed the animals i believe he took the skin and ripped them off why because it's bloody because the same prophet said to they walked out of the garden with the bloody skins flopping on them we'll read one in a minute where brother around said god made a blood atonement who offered the first sacrifice adam no they don't even talk about adam and eve with sacrifices the first physical sacrifice of humanity was when cain and abel i'm not saying they didn't do it before then but i'm saying scripturally you see god was the first murderer because he had to make atonement for a man that had died mankind he made an atonement he didn't have to build a fire because that would come later and to prove that it will come later in the right doings abel it says brought his offering and god consumed it with fire that's the kind of offering i want to make sure that i believe in is a god that can consume it with fire but i just want you to think about it look what brother randall says here on the message go ahead to number eight now on the evening message notes okay verse 21 of what we read it talks about how that god you know made coats of skin placed it on adam and eve and they went out of the garden there is a quote if you want it i didn't bring it because i figured it in order to be enough brother brown said when they started out of that garden with that blood flapping on their legs that's when god said i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman the promise of the messiah so look what he says now drop down to kind of the life's paragraph starting here who told you you were naked then they started as always they call in the army passing a book one to the other god looked around and he found a tree a certain place a place that he thought would be beautiful and he got some skins and threw them back in the bushes and said cover yourself with this and come out before me and god had to do that part they had a conference they talked it over then god made a preparation for them well i'm so glad there was an eden conference then he goes on to the getting away from the fig leaves but god looked around found a tree a certain place and he got some skins and he threw them back in the bushes all right where are we at because i didn't mark them see them so he sewed them together but god killed something to cover their sins and gave a promise that through the woman's seed would crush the serpent's heal god killed them but my god is just not like that you remember here a while back someone was saying but my god can't have a headache well i'm sorry that i've got a decent memory but if he says that your nostrils as your offerings has become a stink in my nostrils you must have an upset stomach you know but see we think that sounds good my god can't do these things who are you i'm not nothing but me who are you we're talking about what the bible says what the prophet said that god killed the animals all right look at the next one way to fellowship 1955 1009. paragraph e33 all right but he went up anyhow because there was one soul calling for him just thank cross the stormy lakes over the cross there to find one soul that was needed needed soul of love all right so then when sin came in it separated man from fellowship notice what god did to bring man back to fellowship he introduced to the world of blood redemption god killed animals and put their skin showing a blood redemption and their god after being separated from it from his created creatures god laid out the welcome mat back home by the shedding of the blood and don't that make you feel and that was then and has been and will always be god provided a preparation for fellowship with him is through the shed blood what about god kill the animals god made the first atonement go ahead to number 10. fellowship 1956 212 courses like wade says they're saying now that we only believe you know that that's not a new doctrine that they're saying we only believe what's after 65. well you know 63 the seals i say you can't understand the opening of the seals if you don't understand what he preached before then that's where i take my stay yeah but he was wrong show me i want you to show me where he was wrong because everything you can show me he was wrong he corrected right and most of them was corrected before the opening of the seals but yeah see that's that devil getting into the mind and reached look at ours brother branham didn't know what he's talking about i wonder how many other people found that i'll get on the internet and see how many of you have ever studied where we've run around so and so then he said so and so and he's contradictory what are you doing where does it get out of the message oh don't you don't want to do that do you why don't you burn your books if he was wrong here right here who's who is the one that can can correct him oh it's you and that's the devil in what he's doing he's still deceiving as he did eve trying to make you doubt the message right but look now since sin broke that fellowship man has been tossed about remember when the doctrine and he still tossed about he was turned down the garden of eden to shift for himself and then that great thing he's still tossing about god made one preparation for a man to be restored back to the fellowship oh no nothing else we have tried he offered to the human race blood was the way back to fellowship god killed some animals and took their skins she had the innocent blood of the animal and brought the skin and wrapped adam and eve in it and fellowship with them again after the shedding of the blood he goes on to explain that's god's way of doing it now it's through the blood of jesus christ how many quotes would you like on this that god killed jesus run in your computer when you get home just run it in your computer to go home see how many times brought around said god killed jesus but yeah we think that god is just a spirit he can't do anything like that he can't pull that skins off of animals what kind of a god you got then if your prophet said he killed him and brought her blood atonement why can't we believe that why can't we accept it and believe it and have understanding and believe that god promised right there in the garden i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman he had already made the atonement i've got one at home we'll get to it wade didn't know it he was quoting it wednesday and he said see there in the garden said god made an unconditional covenant brother branham says that but but i didn't think the unconditional covenant come to abraham it's like brother chris said today and he walked up to me and he said brother dale i think well i didn't i was talking some of them he said brother dale i think i said you ain't got no right to think you see we think this can't be right god made a blood atonement for you and i he made a blood atonement for adam and eve he died himself for you and i the prophet said he tore that life out of that body god killed to make an atonement you think that ain't predestination he knew he was going to fall right we've been through that enough right for knowledge let him know he's going to fall for knowledge let him know he'd have to kill the animals he'd have to make the atonement for you and i a blood atonement but around him said abel saw it was the blood he said he's seen that we are born what what is the seed of man highly congealed blood and he said we are we're seeing that god seen that or abel's scene excuse me that he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood so he made a blood atonement but cain now where did cain we'll get to that as we're going down where did cain get the idea of fruit how many did it just jump out of the sky where'd he get it from he got it from his mama because he sure didn't get it from his daddy his daddy who was cain's daddy he wound up to be in the serpent and he could talk to him yeah i understand that what i'm saying who talked to him because you moved up to that time that you had adam and eve don't you think adam told abel what it was all about but you know mama was so convincing until she told kane what happened you say you don't have no proof that you don't have any proof contrary we solve that problem right where did cain get that idea because mama got the idea of the fig leaves right remember this morning brother brown said they were back in there having church but i don't think adam was preaching i think eve was preaching cain probably said because hey remember when it comes up to cain and abel and offering the officer i remember they were grown men uh and have five-year-old kids making offerings okay it was grown men whatever age you want to put it 18 20 what do you want to put it they were grown men you think about it god spoke to abel but he couldn't get the cane why because somebody already deceived him when we get on down in a little bit think about it so now let's let's read some scripture and let's go ahead and just read a couple of things and just go as far as we can go to genesis 4 that we read this morning number 11. and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear came and said i've gotten a man from the lord and see again by his brother abel the neighbor was a keeper the sheep cane was still under the ground one time it says he knew her and two babies was born you said but but brother dale the bible said and adam knew his wife i agree with you he did and she conceived she did but see she takes over and explaining about cain she's the one that said i got a man from the lord right and said i have gotten a man from the lord she never credited brother branham said as to god bringing forth cain i mean excuse me as as adam bringing forth came but she said god gave her a seed all right now next time he knew her he knew his wife again and she bought a son and called his name seth that's number three child right so there's two conceivings and three children so there's got to be some twins somewhere right so cain and naval were twins the beast was the father of cain and we'll get to it and adam was the father of abel we're going to prove that in the scripture in just a minute all right because that's what i'm wanting to do with the scriptures but there were twins there he said ain't no bible says twins you know the bible says judas went and hung himself and you go do like what he said you're being sarcastic no i'm not i'm showing you you're twisting scriptures read it adam knew his wife and she conceived i agree with that she conceived he knew her but look and bear cane and said who is saying it come on read your bible and she conceived she's the one talking from this point all the way down she's the one that said i have gotten a man from the lord see we want to say that cain was the that adam was the father of cain we'll get to it after a while show me anywhere in any bible lineage whatsoever that cain come from adam i want to read it the last scripture we get to probably wins to be then it said enoch was the seventh from adam that's in the book of jude all right if you put cain in there in abel and coming down you got eight come on but there's a great group of people around the country that teaches and they teach that tubular king we won't say much about it because i'm not arguing no point with nobody i'll just say they run it down on cain's lineage let's see kane's lineage goes the wrong way you come to tubercane on king's lineage you come to enoch on god's lineage it's being number seven okay yeah i don't like to talk too much about the world and they're doing because they can believe what they want to but i'm just telling you it won't line up all right watch now adam knew his wife again genesis 4 25 and see by our son and called his name saith for god said now for god said she what's now hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain's slew hath appointed because see cain couldn't be the promised seed to the woman that was jesus christ so that's why she said have to point it didn't say gave seth was just appointed to bring the human race forward he was not the seed that the woman was promised to bring all right see then it don't match up let's go on to the next all right brother branham says praise 12 i mean prayer got 12 65 911 god's power to transform that cain and abel were twins that's enough we got it we don't have to worry about that it ought to be enough for anybody to know it but they were twins let's go on to the scripture now go to genesis 4 remember and again she by his brother abel and abel was a keeper that she became was the tiller of the ground in the process of time it came to past it came brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord now what i'm wanting to do this afternoon this morning was to go from the spiritual condition of just in our mind there being into the physical condition of the human race that was degraded by the injection of the beast all right but what i want you to think about today what did all of that produce and if we can't see there's something wrong with us spiritually what was the after effects what was the thing what did it produce and improve where it come from right so you can prove that cain never come from adam because of what happens all right so think about it in the process of time cain brought in the fruit of the ground and offering to the lord and abel he also brought her the first thing of his flock of the fat thereof and lord had respect unto abel and his offering but it came in his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth in his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain why wroth and why is thy canon has falling wrong sacrifice right hey i've been through it with the preachers in this message where it said uh abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain that's scripture the brother right here trying to prove it one time said see there see cain's offering was excellent because the bible said abel's was more excellent i said what did cain's offering speak of he said well it did speak of works i said well then are you saying that works is our salvation blood's only salvation or yet cain's offering was just speaking of man's kind working himself to death but it'll do him no good all right but think about it now what happens to make a man get upset when god rejects his sacrifice may i ask this question why do preachers get mad when somebody can preach something that they can't and their countenance changes and they scream and holler and jump up down like one did here in the pulpit one day in a minister's meeting and his own daughter downstairs said well that's him them uh black folks they're a little you know emotional what they're saying didn't know she's talking about her daddy he was up here jumping up and down hollering and screaming get off that topic why don't you count on us fall what is your fault sometimes when i say something we're supposed to believe that the lord's directing us to do but that's all right brother dale there's a lot but what you said about me egos but think about it abel knew it was blood cain thought it was fruit you know a beautiful offering flowers everything and you know sensibly speaking cain's offer looked beautiful he worked himself to death he maybe planted and done things and brought all kinds of stuff maple just laying up there and watching them sheep bro right one day he picks out one he says you it buddy he takes him and kills him god looks down and said hey well you're right cain yours is wrong now i want to ask you the question because i know this doctrine is among the people that may say don't just ask you here do you believe that cain could have been saved i don't ask you to raise your hand but according to a lot of the people in the message cain could have never been saved because if you happen to be of the lineage of adam you know or abel you can be saved but if you're the lineage of the beast or cain you can't be saved you have never heard them things preached yeah now so that means that all serpent seed has no hopes and boy they don't like for me to talk cause i say every one of us man woman child brother for adam and all once that seed was injected into that human race by that beast every baby that covered that wound is polluted amen at least you know where i stand you don't have to guess brother branham what about you he said i was a hybrid we're all born illegitimate you know because you know what brother brown said was born he said with all all born between the serpent and eve that's what he said all of us was born between the serpent and eve why would he say it like that when the serpent don't have no seed he didn't say with all born with the beast no that's why it says it we read there eve is the mother of all living that's why a lot of people you know they believe in illegal aliens and all these things and outer worlds and other generations of people that was created and all kind of doctrines i said according to bible he's the mother of all living if there's any monkeys out there on mars they come from here because they use the mother of all living but why can't we be plain what are the course that we got i thought the bible said the truth has set you free all right we're talking about it last night while we're eating i told him i said the only thing that can do us any good is a reveal word the only thing he said but i just don't believe cain could be saved well let's just read all right go ahead with number 16 which is genesis 4 and 7 and god is saying this if thou doest well shalt not shalt thou not be accepted if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted all right and if thou doest not well do you double state in this opportunity to be well seen life at the door if you don't do good what's going to happen sin will be his desire and i shall rule over him but if you can overcome it sin can't rule you but i i just don't see well all right we let brother my master then you arguing with him see all right go ahead number 17. 1959 all the days of our life e19 let's drop down here to save reading and read all the way down through god still loved him okay let's drop back the best let's read it okay because this is a good one run it back down and he's so much like cain cain wanted to be religious so he went and made his own religion and when he did he brought it before god with something like this here's the best i got this is all i can do about it now take it or leave it that's what brother brown said cain said best that i can do take it or leave it we know what god left it right but who where would that kind of an attitude come from you can't place it on adam you can't talk about it to abel right that's about the way man does today i helped build a church i send my children to church there i put money in there every year and that's the best i can do take it or leave it oh see he wants his own way that's the way cain did but god still loved him who's he talking about cain god still loved him and he still went after him what did god tell cain you'll do well if you'll just worship like your brother abel able come god's way but cain wanted his way and god said now cain i've got nothing against you you want to write these down and keep them if you'll just come over and go the way that abel goes you'll do well sounds like it could be saved god had nothing against him god loved him god went after him god offered it now if god offers you something you're the one turning it down remember that's all in for knowledge and predestination right look at the next one mark of the beast the seal of god or we should listen to this whole message pastor says you believe in god worship that's all you have to do go ahead and roll don't record i'm just saving time reading if that's right then cain was right but remember god said to cain worship like your brother and you'll do well but he didn't want to do it that's the way it is today they don't want to worship god in spirit and the truth they just want to go to church and worship the way the church says worship worship what god said worship but what are we doing that's the way it is today worship like your brother how shout and glory hallelujah wonderful no what is it all of that's part of it but what is worshiping in spirit and in truth there's got to be the word involved right so you can scout scream and holler and worship all you want to and be worshiping the devil brother brown said you can call him jesus jesus and worship the devil now i see his words but think about it just getting a little point across that was 1961 to 217 i guess yeah roll it on up because we're still in the same message the mark of the beast which is this is paragraph e70 after it's brought right up to you and showed to you that the seed of that is the seed of god and just because of prestige you'd have to give up something or quit your denomination or something to receive it and then walk away from it you know what you'll do you'll seal yourself out of the kingdom mark of the beast when god told abel or told cain said just go over and worship like your brother bring a lamb come down here and worship like your brother said you'll do all right do as your brother does you'd be all right sound like he could be saved sounded like god was offering him an opportunity hey we know by studying the message that cain didn't receive it but my point is if god offers it to you you can receive it no you got to be this certain lineage now where's that at look at the next one an uncertain sound 1961-315 and see god told cain he said go ahead and worship like your brother abel and you'll do well go ahead and do the way he's doing it'll be all right with you but he didn't sin lay at the door right come on look at the three kind of believers this is after the seals 11 24 63 three kind of believers progress 165 but abel knew that it wasn't that he uh was blood that took him out he knew that that was it it was the sex blood so he took a little animal and offered it upon a rock and chopped his neck notice cain he said god told him he said why don't you worship like your brother and you'll do all right you'll do well if you'll do that but no he know too much about it see he rejected the original a vindicated word if that ain't his children today worship lucky brother what is that number 20 that's 20 come on okay 22. god's power transformation 65 911 paragraph 183 and if you want to find this i got a scripture here that's what i referring to here genesis 4 6 and 7. god said to cain said why are your countenance fallen why are you all full of temper walking around you just heard a message that upset you and come on said well what are you doing that far why are your countenance fail because i didn't come into your church so why did you do it are you using a thinking man's filter see or why didn't why you looking like that said if you'll do well go ahead do like your brother is doing out there i'll receive you and bless you right i'll do it for you the same thing but he just couldn't do it he said now if you don't if you don't sin of unbelief lies at the door he said i'll accept you see we're trying to make him some lineage and paul warned us he said get away from these endless genealogies right we see we got lineages the people of the message preaching lineages what are you going to do with when you come to the flood right what are you going to do with it when you get to the flood in the flood all you got is noah his sons and his wife and his daughter-in-laws what are you going to do with it we've got to have lineages then you come over to cain i mean come over to uh jacob and you got two brothers born he saw and jacob same mama same daddy look what one of them turned out to be look what the other one turned out to be but i always thought it was lineages brother dale well that's what you've got for thinking well i've always been taught that that's what you get for listening to people that's taught that right i'm talking about you me us in the message listening to people talk about things telling us cain couldn't be saved i gave you four or five quotes where brother branham says that he could if he'd only do like his brother what offer a blood atonement right it's in every one of them if you do like your brother your brother by spiritual revelation offered the blood you go off of the blood and i'll accept you is that what he said i'll receive you and bless you i'll do for you the same thing but you see what we've been taught is laying in us it's hard to destroy that thought like garner ted armstrong said one time he said you destroyed a man's doctrine and said you destroyed the man all right you take away from a baptist preacher the fact that he can dangle you over hell by scaring you to death about you're going to die and go to hell eternally if you don't get saved you take that away from me and got no message a lot of the preachers in this message ain't got a message except trying to show where brother ryan was wrong right but when are we going to do what brother brown said he said i'll be glad when it comes to the time that they'll do like they did in the days of paul look him straight in the eye and say you're not saying what paul said but brother dale i don't want to be hateful no i don't want to be hateful either but my soul is involved in this folks that's right we can argue petty things when we get in heaven ain't got time to argue now we get up to heaven you know there's going to be a lot of things to be talked about do you think luther's going to be sitting over in the corner well all the rest of them had everything good and straight but i didn't have it too straight no he had to just shall live by faith and you know what i'm going to say i'm going to say luther stand up and tell us about it tell us about that just shall live by faith abel tell us about the blood abraham tell me about that unconditional covenant david tell me about that singing they pierced my hands and my feet i think it'll be an embarrassing situation because something we was it's going to be wonderful for what we are somebody's got to get this thing personal instead of arguing doctrines we've got to become a reality i'm going to end it with this what happened in the garden brought death that's right now you show me that that ain't right you show me that ain't exactly what we've been covering because that's what cain went to you think brother dale you're just preaching this one of these days i'd like to get back to seal number one two three and four and i'd like to read and the lord said unto cain why is thy countenance fallen first seal was white horse rider the nicolaitan doctrine right nicolaitan doctrine brought the deception conquer the laity second seal and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the seal he killed him first one's white second one's red right next one's black next one's pale first human murderer was cain that killed abel second seal third seal now thou art cursed from all the earth that received your brother's blood blackness came upon cain and that's your black horse blackness came upon cain and he killed abel that's your third seal for seal and cain went out from the presence of the lord the fourth seal is eternal separation the pale horse yeah i've been preaching this too long folks to want to be deceived about anything i want to go on with the lord don't you but i don't want to get caught by every little deception every little thought little ideas of mankind and silliness because i've been around too long in this message and i went around and listened to all these doctrines and none of them yet has produced a rapture brother brown said why hasn't all your reigns brought christ to the church they've had reigns two souls two lords seven thunder virtue perusia river jordans that all kind of reigns but why hadn't they brought christ no it's only brought arguments about doctrines and ideas instead of bringing christ on the scene into people's heart don't do his cane we'll get to it wednesday that went out of the presence of the lord god never drove him out he went out he went into death had he done what abel done offering the blood he would have been all right right and your prophets the one that said that he would have been accepted but i've just been taught this so much brother dale i think it's about time to lay down some of the things that was taught i was taught all my life that there was one god but it was god in three persons blessed trinity good old baptist deacon standing up teaching the duck sunday school classes saw the truth and walked out what about you you see i found out the lord wasn't in that church he was outside calling me right before i left there tell you a little story right before i left that church i used to go up every sunday and turn on everything get there early just like i do here it's always been my this i don't bother me to come turn everything on get everything done or close it up that that's just me i've always been there i go up to the church and the doors were locked we always had a way of unlocking them without having to turn a key you could just stick a knife in push a little plunger on the front door and you could just walk on in you know i had to keep right now too i just doors locked everything was locked up and i walked in turning on everything getting ready i went down the basement there's a man walking around in there i said heidi he said heidi how you doing he said i'm doing fine he said i was just on my way up down through here and i thought i'd stop by i said well okay i said we're going to have church in a little while if you want to hang around he wasn't scared of him no felt wonderful he said no i said i got to go on he said i'm just going on up the road i said okay remember in a church that was locked up i walk him to the front door of the church he goes out last time i seen him he was on the highway heading towards gainesville well when we left out of that church we went out of that door and we went to gainesville following that man i'm still following him you see church i don't tell everything because people get built on some kind of a thing but god has been with this church right here to bring us through some of the most horrible things and situations and problems it's ever been and we come out of it just being the same loving everybody he never had no feelings against nobody i get hurt feelings come on i'm human but i put them in the ceiling of my britches and i sit down on them and i still love everybody whether you agree with me or what you do i love you i just want god among us to live among us and work among us but the last thing i always pray is god give us the word no matter if this man has to be a castaway you mean you would paul said he would be a castaway for his people you're trying to make yourself like a paul huh no i'm just being myself that's the way i feel and why don't you feel that way right right no it's me in my house and that's for no more so i'm gonna come on brothers musicians let's stand together we'll continue this thought on wednesday night and going into it like what was the mark that was put on cane what was the mark that was put on cane why would brother branham say that there was eternal life in the soul of adam and then turned around on the breach in the seal book and say adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden there's always an answer if we know by revelation right you able knew it was blood they had no problem cain thought because of his mama's doctrine you don't like that you know all the doctrines we have come from the catholic church the woman the old mother right what we got boys i am blessed i am blessed i agree with you so let's sing anybody have a need the altar is open i am blessed i am when i wake up in the morning he said i just believe everything's gonna be all right we lay it down right here and we believe it you believe it amen i believe everything's gonna be all right amen and then i'm gonna doubt my doubts right you believe it father we just ask you to be with our brothers we know as a human being we have a lot of problems but yet we know there is a god who can take care of all those problems we know that he can handle all things and father our brother is not going to go in there tomorrow saying five minutes from now i'm gonna weigh 140 pounds and i'm gonna be 18 years old now he's going in there as a 73 year old man problems and troubles will come out with problems and trouble but they won't find anything connected to it that's a wrong thing because we believe you father and we thank you in jesus name amen amen just believe it anybody else i am blessed every day that i live i am black when i wake up again now this is the way i say it when i lay my head i am blessed see the song says till i well that just means you're blessed half a day i am you just blessed to hype a day i got 24 hours of rest when i wake up in lord jesus take care of everybody so
