bring your horn I figured you would you got a car right so you drove we'll we'll let him play for us this afternoon but uh good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you with us uh we did have a good Bible Study last night and everybody parti anticipated everybody that was there that um they told of their favorite scripture and what it meant to them and and um and how it connected to their life and and it was just wonderful to hear each and every one even the kids tell why their scripture was the most favorite one not just read it but tell exactly why that was their favorite scripture and we all have a favorite scripture because it what it connects to us before the foundation of the world God knew as we were talking about last night in the back part of God's mind the vision part of God's mind he saw all this and he orchestrates this to even today us to be here sir so let's make the best of it amen uh we got communion foot washing today this is first Sunday so um brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night uh on Mother's day which is next Sunday uh brother Bob will be speaking I'll sister Jun and I'll be in Ohio um preaching for them we only have one service next Sunday in the you can go visit your mother or have your mother with you and take her out to eat if you can get in a restaurant one of the busiest days in the restaurant I don't know why youall take your mom out to eat but I guess she have to take her out to eat so she won't have to cook maybe that's what it is so remember that we went to see sister Johnny yesterday and and uh visited her for for a little while before we came to to a Bible study and uh she's in good spirits she still believes that we serve a mighty God even though she's sitting you know laying in a hospital hosital bed she still believes that not a hospital bed but a a rehab facility she still believes it she still believes that God's going to heal her God is the Healer so we're going to believe with her she's going to go with their program she's going to do what the program says the doctor says and then I believe we'll be able to see her again and I appreciate the Lord having doctors that can help our body to be able to heal and uh she's but she's in good spirits she she's tell everybody hello and God bless you and she loves you with the love of the Lord uh also remember um we're going to have a special meeting I told you about it a couple of weeks ago and um we can't have it moral Day weekend cuz some are not going to be here so on June the 2nd the first Sunday of next month is everybody with me we're going to have a service and at the end of the service uh we're going to have ordination of the new members or me and brother and different ones for a service and brother Richard Wilson's going to come he was so happy that yesterday he said yes I'll be there I'll be there so he's coming he's bringing his boys and they won't let him drive now he said so they drive him down here so they going to try to see if the whole church can come so we'll have a regular service on June the 2nd one service and then we'll have a ordination service after that Brother Richard Wilson will be doing it and I uh a lot of you don't know brother Richard he's he um he uh we all grew up together we grew up with his kids he's been uh by Dad's side they've been beside each other for a long time and U and he he stands for the word of the Lord the truth and we sure appreciate Brother Richard and U and him coming and doing that and being happy to do it so that will be and then we'll probably just have a meal after that if want we can stay around in Fellowship but we'll talk about that a little bit later that'll be about four weeks from now but Brother Richard Wilson will be here on June the 2nd one service we'll have ordination service after that and then we will uh have a meal and not have a second service so God bless you we love you with the love of Lord thank you for all the things that uh that last night we had a uh a wonderful time and um in Bible study and if I can get this new thing to work here we'll have something on the screen but today we're still going to be talking about the th tyan Church age but we're going to talk about there was two things that happened in that church age it was one of the longest Church ages right and it was that it was probably the darkest because there was a lot of killing going on uh physically and spiritually so there was two things that went on during that church age that we're going to talk about that affects us today number one is works and it's all convoluted you know well the works works work no we'll we'll we'll we'll see what the prophet said and what the Bible says about it today because they did God told them he said I Know Thy works all right and then we're going to talk about it's really strange if you read the Bible and read it slow it said God says in the church age he says I will kill them with death right well now if you kill them they're already dead no he said I'll kill them with death right dead and don't know it that's what come out of that church age so let's bow our heads just for a minute dear Lord thank you for this time you've given us thank you for the people Lord that's assembled here father that's under this roof I pray that you'd bless them now Lord sanctify them Lord just clear all the uh conscious back as we were talking about Lord let the Holy Spirit uh resonate in the word and and be a uh a sounding board Lord that people can say that ain't nothing but the truth father we pray that you'd be with the ones that are not here that are sick sister Johnny Sister Mary sister Gail different ones Lord I pray that you'd touch their bodies Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones Lord that are here that are sin sick Lord that need you father I pray that you'd anoint them Father as the word Goes Forth the Holy Ghost fall on them Lord and they receive the newness of Life As We were talking about Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones Lord that in the Foreign Fields Lord the ones we're connected with Lord I pray that you'd bless them and be with them them touch them forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make father just bless brother and sister Dale Lord as they're sitting home watching father and Anna I pray that you'd be with them Lord and anoint them Father with anointing that's here in this building now Lord thank you for brother Daniel sister rayma coming Lord bringing their children and having the baby dedicated lord it's an honor and a privilege to do that and hand them back to you Lord you gave them to us now we're going to hand them to you father and you protect their little life in Jesus name amen and brother Boyd's working on the lights it may be a little too bright right here but we're going to work on it don't worry about it you know you remember Abraham Lincoln everybody knows who he is listen to what he said he said I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go I've been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go on our knees let's read Revelations 1 then we'll get started I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as it was a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last that's what we've been talking about well now we're in the middle age all right and what thou see us write in a book and send it to seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara that's the age we're in now that we're talking about now we're in Lea Sardis Philadelphia leosa and I turned to see the voice that fate with men and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of those seven golden candlesticks one liken to the son of man and we talked about the imagery last week and we'll talk about a little bit more clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the PS with a golden girdle you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word and we've been talking on in the church ages about we had the alpha bride and we had the Omega bride and in between oh sorry my son's leading Orchestra Orchestra back there how about that that better okay doie and now we've come to the th Tyrant Church age but we had the two book ends the alpha bride and the Omega bride they mirror images of each other but in between that though go God allowed now listen God allowed man to get involved because he was going to have to restore over here all right he had the full word over here in a group of people but to be to come back as Joel says I will restore all those things there had to be a fall there had to one there had to be a seed go in the ground and die all right to come out into justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and into the fullness of the word that we're into right now all right is everybody with me all right so let's read this this is a long reading but I want you to watch how many times God says works all right revelation 2:18 and to the angel of the church in thyra write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes now remember they don't get the son of man Revelation Until the End Time amen but they do have a revelation of the Son of God which is the spirit God the Holy Ghost dwelling inside the people and really in this church age that was about all they had because once you said you were a Christian you didn't live very long all right but they survived they made it through some people made it through as 68 million as Josh was sending me the sent me the the numbers California and Texas two of the biggest states there's 68 somewhat some odat million people in those two states the Catholic Church along with others destroyed obliterated those two states and there were nobody left 68 million Christians put to death in that age so let's look at this these things sayith the Son of God who ha its eyes like into what flames of fire and feet like into fine brass I Know Thy works all right there it is I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works there it is again and the last to be more than the first we won't read the rest of it we'll get through the church ages here now remember we were in the church ages and we see that each one of them had a messenger there was a star there was a the messenger come Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then we had the Holy Ghost come on day of Pentecost and then you had the Elijah anointing for the end time all right everybody with me on that I just really appreciate what our brother said this past Wednesday night that was a good message there putting Elisha and it types us and that's who we are we're the Elisha we have the Elijah anointing but Elisha typed the brides what brother random said all right but you and I are now in this L of and age but the th iring age was the fourth age and it was the longest age from 606 to 1520 and then what happened was now in Ephesus smna pergamus there was a full word of God and then man got involved man got involved man got involved man man got involved and it was it was so-called Christian men got involved it wasn't and yes it was the Devil Himself but he was disguised as the word of the hour for the day everybody with me that sound familiar all right he's disguised himself today in the word of the day but today remember today is the Apex today he is going to sit on a throne here on Earth and be called God but it started in infancy back there I was looking at some old notes and and I'll bring it out maybe later on but you know in James it says when lust is conceived it brings forth sin When sin is finished it bringeth forth death when it's finished you got those four stages to go through if you cut them off in either one of those you know because we all sin as we were talking last night we're Sinners saved by grace but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul can't sin anymore never can never will nothing be held against you so if you do sin it's in your spirit realm and you allow it to happen well the devil made me do it well I think we blame him a little too much cuz you're a free moral agent right you can do whatever you want to do you're a free moral agent and you do and you say the devil made me do it well let's talk about that a little bit more no he didn't you did it right let me get rid of this so now remember everything happens the lap over is the Grace from one age to the other so you got you got the first three ages you've got actually St Patrick was not a church age messenger but in the th tyan Church age he was born of St Martin's sister so there was a connection there between the church age messenger before that and the pergan church age then you had um St Patrick comes in and then St Patrick passes away and then Here Comes Columba so Columba is a messenger to this age all right and he was born in Donal Ireland where brother George Quinn's from but in that lap over there was something happened even the good happened but even the evil happened there was a ni seeeing counsil there was people getting together saying oh he was not God he was a likee substance or or he couldn't be this and couldn't be that and and the idea of a trinitarian Doctrine came up an idea of a of a father son Holy Ghost baptism came up right in that lap over and then the church age comes but from the pergan church age it look it's it's called it means thoroughly married so so as Christ and the bride are married so is Satan and his bride are married thoroughly married listen it wasn't get me let me H let me talk let me say this it wasn't bad when a Ahab was on Earth and Jezebel was on Earth it's when they come together it's when they come together is when the Havoc happened the murder began to happen it's when they thoroughly married when they when church and state thoroughly married under Constantine that's when the problem started if you'll look in history though they think Constantine's a really good guy he created The Crusade and he had the the cross backs and all those things he was a deceiver he was the one that brought it down and he brought it down under the ospice of making religion P more powerful sure it's true religion was more powerful I said religion whose religion you talking about the devil's religion cuz they were thoroughly married during that pergan church age and then it carried right on over into the tharan church age this one lasted from 3:12 to 606 and remember the council 9A was 325 ad and that's when they began to come together all right is everybody with me and during that age there was some that held fast the name and then we're going to see we know where Satan is we know where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against you because thou Hast there in them that hold that doctrine of balum which was what trickery it was trickery under the opice that we were going to be better off if you put these two together right listen remember there's one God that's right and one God with one bride doesn't make two one God with one bride make one yes sir if you got two brother Brown said anywhere you got two one's God one's the devil all right who taught Bop to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrifice the idols and commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine now it becomes a Doctrine a doctrine of the nicians it's something that now is preached it's not hidden in a corner somewhere it's being preached from a pull Pit All right so they've come and brought it to the pull pit and what have they brought they brought a Doctrine that was false and God hated it but remember it wasn't that he couldn't do anything about it God allowed this to happen so that this next Church age everything could fall in the ground cuz by that time everything was gone in the fourth Church age there was nothing much of the first three ages in that fourth Church age cuz man had got involved Rome had got involved right right but there still was a group of people out of all that made it out of all that they made it you come to church today if they came to church during their time and they got caught they died right and they'd throw you in the lines then but now God told them in that third Church age he said repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and fight against them with a sword of my mouth there was a group of people that did that that fought against it in every age there is a true bride every age there's truth but now remember remember in every age there's faults too that's the law of contrast so the pergan church age brother R said Look by the time this third Church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth that's what we're going to get into this afternoon afternoon and as I was telling last night we kind of touched on it a little bit the denominational system is what's dead now there's people that'll be given eternal life there's people that'll come out of that but the system is dead now when it's dead it don't come back that's why brother R said he said read that again I will kill them with death death killing death you think well that's not right well we'll look at this afternoon we'll see that it's absolutely the truth we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her that really is what the definition of dead means you have no life she has hybridized herself and the signs of death that's what we'll talk about this afternoon the signs of death not life follow in her wake but now if you look on the outside and looked in your history books they started making big Cathedrals they started putting up as brother Bob and different ones saying you you look at these great big churches you say how in the world do they even pay the power bill the pipe organs you know millions of dollars just so you can play so it sounds good but they're dead the Bible says you're dead while you're alive and if that darkness in you if that that light in you that you think you have be Darkness how great is that Darkness think about that in our life let's get that part of the darkness out that we think is light we think we're okay let's don't ever think we're okay right let God tell us we're okay as we were talking last night we're going to be sticky right up to the change that's right we're going to be old those of us that are old are going to be old right up to the change but praise God what a change that'll be as we were talking last night in th Thessalonians somebody asked a question about that we got to get the dead out of the ground the Dead's got to come back before we take a Rapture so don't be talking about a Rapture be talking about a message of Resurrection the same loud voice that called ra Lazarus from the grave is going to speak through us one day maybe sooner than we think but the dead in Christ shall rise first she is powerful with many members she is favored by the world is that but God says no God says separate from that God said if you love the world the things of the world love of the father is not in you all right she is favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word yes and the signs follow her the sick are healed the dead are raised I was reading about Columban and many things in his life as I was reading on the internet one guy he was like this just can't be they've exaggerated his life brother R said he didn't read that but brother R said he was solid he healed the sick raised the Dead uh walked up to a a big old stone wall one time that had Gates and they wouldn't let him in the city and he just turned around walked away and something said turn back around and the gates open and what happened was one of the guys inside one of the Chiefs or something his son fell dead and they called him in to pray for him and he converted a whole bunch of people there that's how God works That's how little Columba got around and then Columbo would take 10 or 12 of his monks and he would go to an island or go to a place and he would build a city there's an island over there called high Hy over in Ireland now and was the worst Island there was nothing growing there was no habitation and they said now it's the most Lush Island in Ireland three miles long and a couple miles wide a little bitty Island but it's called the island of Columba because he went there took his monks there and it flourished now under his ministry but what he would do he would teach those monks and then send them out and they converted in in Ireland and and different countries like that Scotland and all that in the UK is where Columba did his work the sick are healed the dead are raised she is alive with life in the word of God she loves not her life now that's that's the group of people coming up that they love not their life unto death but holds to his name and his faith even unto death now come on folks you and I have not been through that before these people may have persecuted for what you believe are persecuted because you wear pants or don't wear pants men wear pants and and not shorts and women wear dresses and and U you''ll be persecuted for that but not to kill you that's right these people were listen these people were Christians and they didn't dress one way and the others dress another way they all dressed the same back then you didn't have to worry about a woman wearing pants she didn't have none on but it was what it was the life they lived it was they they went to church they served God they were different we got to be different God's going to only one to make you different though cuz you can think you're different but all of a sudden one day you're going to be just like the world if you don't have what's inside of you to make you different and that's where these four living creatures and we'll get back on to them when we start on the seals and and and bring out a little bit more but remember in Revelations 4:6 there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was a lion second was a calf third was a face of a man and then we are in the now Eagle anointing age the flying eagle and and listen it's like I said before a lion when it's born it has to have milk now it's going to be a meat eater but it has to have milk right a calf when it's born it's a grass eater but it drinks milk first several years or months of its life and then we don't start feeding little U little Ava don't is not going to eat a steak today okay she might she's a little bit older but you're not going to feed a baby you're going to feed it what milk and even Paul talks about the sincere milk of the word we all have to grow as babies do look at the life of the ba of you look at your life and that's the way your Christian life grows that's the way I can see it right right by your life by my life pretty simple it's like brother Bob said they we know when the Bible says no man don't need no man to teach you anything or brother brandom said that that don't mean that you can s home we shouldn't have to be told not to commit adultery if you're a Christian you won't we're not to be told don't we're not to be told now don't y'all steal there something wrong with you if you if you're still stealing in cursing or cursing cursings in the South but if you're still doing that then you don't have the giver inside of you that'll give you deliverance from that everybody with me it's pretty plain it's like your brother said you don't have to tell a Christian to come to church it's only the Sinners and unbelievers that you have to tell to come to church well praise the Lord anyhow CU listen a born again Christian will do what the Bible says without somebody teaching them every Sunday to do it now as far as growing up in God yes we need Apostles prophets pastors teachers because the Bible says for the perfecting of the Saints not to make you a saint but to perfect you as a saint to help you walk and this right here the lion ox or calf the man the man intelligent but as intelligent as man is like I said before take a bottle you drink a bottle when you get started we don't want to do that when we're a little older we get away from those things Paul said not going back to that but grow up all right and then a flying eagle doesn't have any milk glands it definitely starts out eating meat so in this church age brother rown called us Little Eagles Messi all the different things where she's a she's a supernatural group of people she only responds to Revelation she loves Revelation she loves this message of the hour and that's the Flying Eagle because what Mama Eagle does is she kills this big rabbit brings it over there now she doesn't stuff that rabbit down the throw of that of that eagle it'll choke it so what does she do she breaks it down every Sunday and Wednesday praise the Lord breaks it down and then takes and puts little bits in his mouth and then when that eagle grows he's like rabbit equals food amen same way with the word of God equals food right not a drudgery not I have to if I don't come to church brother Way's going to I hope you didn't come here to see me I hope you come here to find a word of God for your life but it had to be done through the foolishness of preaching sorry about that but God must have thought it the best way to do it or he'd have picked another one amen so cuz I I believe don't we believe God will never make a mistake right he don't make mistakes right okay I just thought we was in the same group all right so the four Beast had one of six wings they were full of they rest not day or night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come and these living creatures living creatures they're called zooms are living beings they're not theion beasts which come up in the Book of Revelations 13 and the different places 1113 and 17 those are untameable theory on Beast which are you see them working now isn't that an untameable world out there yes you can't tame that world brother R said you put a you put Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in the every seat in the house and the Senate and even in the in the White House you can't turn this thing around Satan has got his hand so far into what not the political listen politics is horrible right but what's going to kill us the people in the religion the people in the churches the people in denominations that's what's going to kill us don't worry about President whoever gets to be the next president he's just a puppet anyway I was reading about a family the other day and and they're worth over $2 trillion dollar and we don't even know who they are Jeff bezo is worth 145 billion well now a trillion is 10 times that and it or 100 10 or anyway 2 point something trillion dollars this family and no even know their name we know it's the Roth Charles and the different ones that you know all those uh things that from back when but they've all changed their name now so they don't know who they are but they're running the world money women and popularity that's what's running this nation too right everybody wants to be popular we want to be the great United States of America that that runs the world and we will we have great military power I love Israel my goodness that little old country that ain't much bigger than Rhode Island they snuck about 25 or 30 of their missiles went through Syria went through part of Iraq and hit Iran's defense system and nobody caught him on radar not one person you know what Israel said there's more to come big boy Israel said you throw some more over this way you know we just threw those over there and you didn't even know where they were coming from they got so so much technology that no not one radar system picked it up between three countries and it hit their air defense system so Israel was just giving them a little what they call it a shot across the bow said hey you send them over here and even one guy I was reading it yesterday one guy said Iran you made a horrible mistake said we're not coming he said we got people already there so they got people within already that's praise God he takes care of his own Israel may have been divorced Israel may but he said I'll never forget her I'll never forget Israel and Israel will be there right there with us the 144,000 but that theory on Beast that that characteristic is is right now but it's all going to head up in what one the Antichrist and the world is you can read all over the Internet what say the Antichrist is Trump the Antichrist is Biden the Antichrist is that set of drums they're living in the system of antichrist and don't even know it they're think it's something outside lessen let's don't think of the evil outside let's get rid of the evil inside let's get rid of us yes sir get us out of the way and let God bring his bombs in and knock all that out of the way for us not worry about I don't worry about what the Baptists are doing I really don't worry about what Israel's doing but it's fascinating to see one little bitty country that everybody hates except a few and when we start hating them it's going to be terrible on us but they've got enough technology to send 16 or 18 of their missiles right through everybody's defense system and never knew it that'll make you almost cry I mean come on people that technology came from God to those people to ser survive if not listen if it wasn't for God's hand Israel wouldn't be here today that's right so God's hand is in all that he's let those missiles go through he give them the technology you say well America's helping them well America helps some but I'm going to tell you something Israel's a country of its own and it's got its own way of doing things if you'll notice it doesn't have to go through Congress and the Senate and go through a stinking president before they they drop bombs they drop bombs and then let you know about it later I like that but these beasts are wild Untamed Savages look at all the killings that's going on mass murders everywhere that's that theory on beast in that system but I'm talking about the theory on beast that's inside of the system working trying to get me and you what off course trying to get me and you just one crack just one one crack that's why the Bible says compacted compact this thing down to where Satan can't get in because listen if he ever if he ever gets a foothold he can get in we know that cuz that happens to us amen but untameable Beast are is all that black but it heads up in the end time in a man that the World believes is their savior finally all right going to save everybody but what he's going to do he's going to destroy everything that b of Armageddon he's going to destroy everything he's going to go to Israel he's going to kill the 144,000 he's not going to do it personally but he's going to do it through his system it's a system so I said we're not an organization we're an organism a living working organism not an organization he all right everybody with me so there's your lion ox man and Eagle the first three Ages was the lion age the ox age we're getting ready to talk about the man age is coming up with Luther and Wesley and then the eagle age is the age that you and I are in that flies higher that we start we we we get born again and then we do desire the sincere milk of the word but to grow thereby Paul said but leaving those principles we got to go on to Perfection we got to eat some rabbit we got to eat some chicken it's going to take these four beasts listen it's going to take these four beasts to open the seals I know Jesus Christ open the seals but who is he he is those four beasts I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard it where the noise of thunder and John's just standing there in awe but one of the four Beast says come here John I want to show you something I want to show you something special I want to expose the Antichrist to you even in this first church age that's what that lion anointing did the lion called out and said come and see John then the next age what was it come and see John the ox age then you got come and see John the man come and see the eagle age and then they left and we left we leave with them everybody with me then we talked about the scene there in Revelations where the first of the throne is first at this Throne is four living creatures we know there's one Throne one sitting on the throne all right outside of that is 24 Elders sitting upon the throne upon their Thrones brother Brown said around this is a great host of angels see what I mean they're everyone different one from the other there's Angels elders and here is living creatures because those four living creatures were there in that scene listen wherever the bride's at is where the is where those four beasts are going to be four living creatures that's what you need every day you need the boldness of a line to be able to talk the word of God and say this is where God said it and I believe it you show me where he took it out then the ox you got to be able to labor with somebody have patience that's why patience is right here that's about that middle age you get in there where you look and see that you need the ox to get through and then you got to have the intelligence of the man as we were talking last night you got to know what it's somebody's quot you know brother Dale always said I don't know how to quote all the scripture he said but I know somebody that can or I know how to find it in other words he's got he's got he get information well that's what the man anointing is a man anointing is what if man came down if man came here that anointing came to put this thing together and remember we were talking about tendale tendale they killed him they druged him through the street and killed him for writing the Bible or for putting it together look what they went through just to get this thing to us but the man anointing allowed them to do that print and presses and all these different things but remember that man anointing also created cars guns yes which kill more people than anything that's right so you got to know which side you're on and then the eagle anointing as you're flying higher this is one thing see Satan can imitate all those other ones but he can imitate the eagle he can to a point remember brother R said the the crow can go so far hello yeah the the hawk can go so far the devil can go so far but there's a Time folks right now in this end time where we are to be Untouchable in the word of God we're to be where Satan can't do anything with us because we have so much of the word of God we're wrapped so much into this Spirit of the of not the spirit of that age but the spirit of this age the eagle anointing they come to us through a prophet that Shields us and we know how to use this thing right here Paul said by reason of use is your senses exercised you want big muscles sit around and eat tear chips you have big muscles work out exercise your listen every one of you sitting in here today like we talk about this morning or yesterday afternoon and and and if you wasn't there I W wish you would listen to watch it because you take every one of those people there were 30 or more people in that room everyone now there was a couple maybe had the same scripture but there was from habca to Isaiah to Malachi to job to Esther it was the whole plethora of it wasn't just like we all believe Malachi 4 well we do all believe in Malachi 4 but we also believe in Revelations 10 as as that was uh brother luis's favorite not 107 108 through 12 because it what it identifies us with it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God to be finished and then John says give me the book and the book's open all right give it to me John said John didn't say now if I'm worthy no and he didn't take it from the seventh angel messenger either he took it from the mighty Angel you and I now listen to me brother brandom's off the scene we don't have to go through him to get to God we go through his message to get to God but we don't have to go through him him to get to God he's not our intercessor God is our intercessor the Holy Ghost is our intercessor listen if you want Power get the Holy Ghost if you want to solve some of your problems get the Holy Ghost if you want to live a better life get the Holy Ghost if you want your kids to grow up better get the Holy Ghost and show it to them it all hinges on the Holy Ghost yes sir those four living creatures living inside of you listen there's a life inside of a life we live a human life we have children we do the things of man sorry we go to work we eat we breathe but there's something inside of you that's way different than that and as we were talking about last night here's the deal sin was so bad and sin was so contrary to God everybody with me till Even Adam who had the Holy Ghost in his soul remember he had eternal life in his soul he bypassed that cuz he knew what he was doing he bypassed that into his Spirit realm and then what he what happened memory reason conscious faction imagination his affection took over sir and to save Eve absolutely to save Eve he took her yes not to have sex with her but he took her to himself he said God don't kill her you'll have to kill me what's the thing listen all down Through the Ages you look at Moses he said God if you got to kill them you got to kill me what brother randam say he said God I got him my own a limb Pok word Original Seed and I don't know what to do Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and write said as of yet m for not been made known or fulfilled so he knew his message had to go longer everybody with me that's just real simple to see that that that brother Brown thought he preached it all he thought he had done it all he thought he had brought us to a point which he did he brought us back to that mirror image of the first church age restored the gifts tied up the Loose Ends brought all that back to he but the book was still closed the book had to be open the seals had to be broke so that you and i' have a chance to sit here today and take a body change without that you can't denominations can't bring it they're hybridized right they got too much of their own ideas do we have too much of our own ideas we can be a denomination of our own self if we don't watch it but see was so bad don't we ask you a question as I asked him last night how many had a bad thought today oh raise your hand you just had one now against me H right brother Kylie now where'd that come from if you're born again today where'd that come from it didn't come from God it didn't come from your soul it came from your emotion your spirit realm it overrode what the Holy Ghost could do if you just listen to it oh yeah come on people we don't sin in our soul if we're born again you don't sin in your flesh if you're born again you sin in your spirit your body just does this just does what's told it to do we've got that Holy Ghost so bound brother said the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years not because of anything but misinterpreted theology or denomination or man's own ideas that's how it was bound but he said but in the end time it's been loosed by the seventh angel message praise God we're underneath that praise God we're a part of that we just got to reach out and get it let that Soul work let it take over right but we don't but we're working on it so we got the lonox man and Eagle we know what each one of them were and we kind of give you the the little little drawing there of how the lonox man an eagle kind of strange that the line of the tribe of Judah is on the East I wonder who he's talking about Jesus said I'll come from the East all right then you've got down at the bottom Reuben which was the which is the man anointing and he was the first one born of the Patriarchs of the 12 then you got the ox age over there in the west and then you got the eagle anointing at the top which is Dan and that's at the North pretty good Eagle anointing up here but they protected what the mercy seed so now where is that Mercy Seat listen that Tabernacle has been destroyed all right it's been destroyed it's laying somewhere in Israel or somewhere in Iraq or Iran or somewhere and America is now helping them get the red heer which they have several more than just a few now they have that they deal that they work with but you got to have that you got to have they have to go through steps as we we're going to talk about this afternoon under the law you have to go by the law if you're not born again today you are under the law yes you are under dos and don'ts right but the Bible says we're free from the law of sin and death we're going to read it I didn't think I didn't know so Much Death was in the Old Testament till I got to reading it the other day I had to just scratch the surface I mean if you if you if you killed a man certain thing you died if you if you worked on the Sabbath you died it wasn't that they smacked you on the hand saying they don't you do that no more you died died dead so what I mean about death Bible say death has no more dominion over us we were born under the law we know that Jesus Christ was born under the law but what he did he redeemed us from the curse of the law he didn't do away with the law he didn't do away with the law he couldn't cause the law having a shadow of things to come we'll get well we'll get to it this afternoon I'm message today so those Temple guards it's the Holy Ghost guarding what that Temple you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost yes sir and those four living creatures creatures not dead ideas those four living creatures help you through life if you'll let it help you through listen who's your worst enemy you said me brother already said me he so he said me so it's me your worst enemy is you that's our worst enemy that's who we we fight with that man every day if you don't fight you need the Holy Ghost then the fight begins I mean a real fight a struggle but praise God for those that went through that praise God for these people went through this church age and come out of it cuz some of them had to make it to the lap over so that Luther's age could take over and take us into the justification and then sanctification in the baptism my Holy Ghost everybody with me all right so the th tyan Church age was 606 to 1520 very long Church age it last for 900 years and listen that 900 years was killing physically killing Christians because they said they were Christian and not a Catholic that's why they call it the Dark Ages that's why the ox anointing it just it was a labor to make it through but we'll look at that in just for a minute cuz remember the ox is slow but still works sir come on the ox are slow but it still works you really don't see you don't see horses now you might have years ago but mostly it was mules donkeys and Ox cuz they walk but they're powerful you don't want to race horse and get behind it with a with a plow they call that dragging they call that getting drugg all right but if you got an ox you just kind of get the gate and you walk through get the Gate of the of the animal and you walk through that's what this this age was it it was a powerful age in that they made it through but it was a long age that they had to depend on even Columba their messenger listen we rever our Messer amen and we're lucky enough and fortunate enough to have it in tape and book form amen they didn't Columbo was already dead before this Ox anointing age now sure it came from his message right came from that four star but he was already gone he wasn't there to go to the people and say no don't do this don't do that this is what this is they had to go by the holy ghost that was inside of them to listen to what it said to get them through now remember the word thyra means dominating female or it means also continual sacrifice and boy did they not 68 million of them gave their life the messenger was Columba he lived from 521 to 597 he was born in Donal Ireland see he he died in 597 the age started 606 so he was already gone before the church age started but his message was so powerful God anointed that man so powerful till he wasn't in taping book for him like we got it was Word of Mouth the ministers or the people that were in the uh the abies they call them then the churches and and the areas they had to listen and if you weren't there you missed it all right let's read this real quick let's look at this just for a second until the angel of the church in thra write these things sayith the Son of God who ha his eyes like into flames of fire and his feet are like fine brass in other words God's going to pass judgment on this church age okay he's not going to forget what they did look I Know Thy works there's the first one and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works all right he said that's number two now watch and the last be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou Hast sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants my servants Satan got into the church with this Jezebel Doctrine did you see that seduce my servants and to to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent thank God he always gives them a space to repent and I gave her her her her the church a space to repent of her fornication and she repented not you're not going to get the Catholics to repent for what they did they have a just ification for what they did behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent there he is again except they repent now he said Works twice all right and I will kill her children with death I will kill her children he didn't say I'll kill her with a sword I'll kill her with a gun I'll kill her with a knife cuz that would be what you would you would think that's what God said he said no I'm going to kill them with death amen we'll see what brother rown says about that we'll talk about this afternoon and all the churches see he's very he all the churches shall know that I am he which serth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto everyone of you according to that's number three your works but unto you I say and unto the rest of thyra as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden so in other words they don't have to know what the seals are they don't have to know about Daniel 7 weeks they don't have to know about the Statue of perfect man they just survived Jesus Christ was their savior yes and that was it but he said I'll put no more on you cu the burden already is on you you're going to die but that which you have already ready hold fast till I come now watch this verse 26 it was your Works your Works your works three times now watch and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works whoa you don't overcome by your works you overcome by his Works absolutely keepeth my works until the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessel of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I have received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star we'll talk about that later on he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so the ox age is an age of works and that's what we'll get this is the point real quick James 2:1 17 even so faith if it hath not works is Dead all right being alone all right cuz brother Randon preached works his faith expressed all right watch now remember he said your Works your Works your Works my Works everybody with me just for a few minutes check yourself even so faith if it ha not works is dead being alone there is no way you can be a born again Christian and not have work works but you can have works and not be born again you watch out for people that work work work work work work they always want to work they always want to work they always want to work you better be ly of that person because they're wanting to work their self into heaven not get born again and do the works everybody with me I've seen it several times yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have works show me thy faith without thy works and I'll show thee my faith by my works for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also yes sir all right this great faith there's got to be Works follow it but you can have all kind of works and be dead as a doornail that's why he said I'll kill them with death I'm going to kill them with the very thing that they die I'll get to it this afternoon it's really interesting what brother M says about that and at TH time Church age here again we find the same introduction remark I Know Thy works the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work sake even Jesus said look if you can't believe me believe me for the works but remember when they believe then they put all the emphasis on the works when he began to say I am my father a one or he began to say I am God they couldn't take it but they loved his Works healing signs and wonders that's what this this this whole this everything's going to be tied to signs and wonders but it is the right one there's two Spirits working remember believe me for the very work sake he put an emphasis on his own works not yours on his own Works my Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship work workmanship we work created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians 2:10 said that's Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him this is Brother Brown on the tharan church age now works will never take the place of Faith Watch Works will never take the place all right it'll never take the place of faith in God for our Salvation all right but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life hallelujah praise Goden it'll come forth just as the fruit if you if you plant an orange tree oranges are going to come out on that limb good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can hello but you know what they don't cuz the world took over and what is it I I mean me it's a selfish world now selfie world now what is horrible in the sight of God now watch is for men to do evil works and then say they were doing the will of God that's what God can't stand in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within yes sir men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right right and if it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees whoa whoa I should have underlined that when and made it it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even what if it cost you your life are you willing to do that are you willing to take a bullet for God so brother Brian preached works is Faith expressed amen I know th works and the last to be more than the first brother Bri said look this is s this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder now here's a rebuke to us our problem in leosia is we get the clamps put on us we go backwards oh I'm going to read it don't you think I already know He already said that in our age we cow down their age they knew they were being put to the lines they knew that what was going on they were going to to die for and brother R said they worked harder and harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was in that Ephesian age where love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there's no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increase of it yes that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is I ain't going to church they don't like me no more I just don't go oh Lord I got to sit beside somebody I got to listen to that baby cry I I I got this little ache in my leg oh my car needs working on I really don't like that guy in the pull pit let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service yes sir we can sit here me and you were talking about something the other day you can sit stand here and you can tell people if you're having trouble don't stay out of church you do not listen to what we say now is that true that's true we all go these people in this church age said what Bring it on Bring it on my faith will be increased by what I do by what I do step out for God and he'll be there for you he was with them yes I don't say this is thus sayith the Lord but I promise you if if the first martyr we're going to talk about it today this afternoon the first Marty was Steven the Bible said he fell asleep come on that's right these people fell asleep I don't believe they felt a line pulling their guts out I believe God give them an anastesia sir it's called the Holy Ghost sir to get through that age and to look over and and and and see a Roman a Roman looking at them going what in the world and so much of a of a spirit coming off those people till the Romans get converted praise God they'll be in heaven yes what a greater thing sure we all want our kids to come to church we all want our kids to be born again but what about one day your greatest oh wait a minute you don't have an enemy right just pray for me um to see your greatest Tormentor not the devil now the one that torments you like your coworker your mother-in-law your father-in-law those different things don't hit me but what Greater Joy is to see them give their heart to the Lord what Greater Joy was it for those people that walked in that lines Den knew they were not coming out and knew that Roman was there to stand to make sure they didn't go back in the catacomb and for him to just start tearing up and saying God what's at first he's going to say God what's wrong with them people when he gets done he's going to say God what's right with them people hallelujah the same way with me and you how about your greatest enemy can you lead them to the Lord or you going to put them in hell yeah I'm going to preach that's our problem we want our enemies dead sure we want our enemies dead the devils and we know the devil gets in people but what a great joy was it to see those Christians turn and look and that Roman start tearing his armor off he takes and throws that spear down and he says whatever you got I want whatever you got I want it and he get the Holy Ghost right before he dies hallu what a confession amen see I'm getting too old for this I want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days now watch he now he jumped over from this tharan church age to our age and then we'll close and pick up this afternoon it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity what's iniquity knowing to do better not doing it or doing it knowing you shouldn't the love of many will wax cold in the lay out ofy or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God have I went down somebody's aisle yet if not pray for me we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days sir it is time to draw n to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us wow that's a prophet so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effects of this last day spirit it's time to draw n of God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us tell you what let's stop right here musicians come on we we'll cover this this afternoon let's stand what's The Last Enemy to be destroyed death all right if you're born again you got one done right then we'll continue on where he says I'll kill them with death and as we were reading last night in Thessalonians it says those that are asleep Christ will bring with him the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first that's not dead physical you got if you don't die here you got another death you got to die over there hello somebody listen we're asleep if you're born again you're asleep but
