[22:50] holy holy holy
[22:54] i want to see you
[22:59] praise the lord good to be in the house
[23:00] of the lord this evening i trust that
[23:02] you're
[23:03] happy to be in the house of god and
[23:07] and that you feel that
[23:10] hey man this is no place like home
[23:12] there's no place like home
[23:14] amen i i believe that where the word of
[23:17] god goes forth that's home to me
[23:20] amen where the the word of god is my
[23:24] home
[23:24] amen that's my home base if i don't know
[23:27] where to go
[23:27] i don't know what to do what where where
[23:29] how to turn next what decision to make
[23:32] next i just turn to the word amen
[23:34] i think the word has the answer to all
[23:36] of our questions in life
[23:39] some way or another maybe not directly
[23:42] but some way or another
[23:43] the answers are in there and the thing
[23:46] is that we have to do is we have to seek
[23:48] and we have to study yeah and that's the
[23:51] part that we don't like to do
[23:53] that's the part that oh that's boring
[23:56] but
[23:57] you're not gonna find if you don't seek
[23:59] you're not gonna
[24:00] you're not gonna you're not gonna
[24:02] proceed with your life
[24:04] with your christian life you're not
[24:06] going to move on with god if you don't
[24:08] do your part
[24:09] it's a simple thing yet it's so hard
[24:12] it's one of the two things that brother
[24:14] branham said that
[24:15] how do we grow as christians you know
[24:16] read your bible pray every day
[24:19] but yet it's the hardest two things for
[24:21] us to do
[24:22] because we don't want to do it we'd
[24:24] rather just go to sleep we'd rather just
[24:26] go do something else because that's the
[24:28] easiest thing
[24:29] but see that's what satan's trying to do
[24:31] you have to realize that
[24:33] they say your soul depends on it that's
[24:35] why your soul's worth ten thousand
[24:36] worlds yes sir
[24:37] it means it has unlimited value so feed
[24:41] your soul what it needs amen because the
[24:44] only thing that the word of god if you
[24:45] have the holy spirit in your life the
[24:47] only thing that you can feed off of
[24:48] and really feel satisfied is the word
[24:51] nothing else netflix won't do it
[24:53] instagram won't do it facebook
[24:55] boyfriends girlfriends they won't do it
[24:57] you know only the word of god and in
[25:00] reality i know that that's what you want
[25:02] because you really that's what you're
[25:04] thirsting for but you're seeking it in
[25:06] other things in other areas
[25:08] when in reality what you want is the
[25:09] word and until you realize that that's
[25:12] the word that where is that what you
[25:13] really
[25:14] want then the word can't help you
[25:17] but when you realize there's nothing
[25:19] else i can go to nothing else has
[25:21] satisfied me nothing else can satisfy me
[25:23] but this word then the word then can
[25:25] step in and help you
[25:27] i don't know who that was for but uh
[25:30] but i hope that you receive it amen
[25:32] praise god i came in here already
[25:34] shooting
[25:35] [Laughter]
[25:36] well greetings in the name of the lord
[25:39] i'm so glad to be in the house of god
[25:40] i'm glad that brother dale's doing
[25:42] better i appreciate god how
[25:46] how he's uh how he's still healing he's
[25:48] still doing wonderful things in this
[25:50] hour
[25:51] amen lots of people around the world
[25:53] praying for brother dale amen
[25:55] even people who don't even know him
[25:56] personally just all over the place so we
[25:59] just thank god for the saints praying
[26:01] thank you all for
[26:02] for praying for him amen so as you stand
[26:05] um
[26:06] we're going to go ahead and go to the
[26:07] word let's read in jeremiah chapter 18.
[26:10] i want to talk tonight a little bit
[26:12] about the potter and the clay amen
[26:14] i know we've heard many things about
[26:16] this in the past but maybe maybe we can
[26:18] say something here that that will help
[26:21] you amen and that will
[26:23] motivate you uh in this hour i think it
[26:26] i was going to go a certain direction
[26:28] and and and just the lord put this
[26:29] thought in my heart and i said well
[26:31] maybe i should go this way so
[26:34] amen so let's just bow our heads before
[26:36] we read our heavenly father we come
[26:38] before you lord once again we thank you
[26:40] father for the opportunity to
[26:42] open back the pages of your word lord we
[26:44] know father god that when them we find
[26:46] strength lord we find the answers to
[26:48] life lord jesus
[26:49] without you father god we can do nothing
[26:52] and lord you are the word father
[26:54] so we pray now that you would forgive us
[26:56] for our sins if there's any iniquity in
[26:58] our lives any wrong that we've done
[27:00] place it all under the blood of jesus
[27:02] christ father god
[27:03] for we cannot save ourselves lord but
[27:05] all
[27:06] salvation all healing comes from you
[27:09] father god
[27:10] and so lord we place ourselves before
[27:12] you lord anoint our ears and anoint our
[27:14] lips lord that we may say something that
[27:16] would help us
[27:17] to leave here edified and you glorified
[27:20] father
[27:20] for it's our desire lord jesus in jesus
[27:23] christ's name we pray
[27:24] amen amen praise god jeremiah chapter 18
[27:28] verse 1 through 6 and then we're going
[27:30] to read in isaiah chapter 45
[27:32] two verses there the bible says the word
[27:35] which came to jeremiah from the lord
[27:37] saying
[27:38] arise and go down to the potter's house
[27:40] and there
[27:41] i will cause thee to hear my words
[27:44] then i went down to the potter's house
[27:47] and behold he rather work on the wheels
[27:50] so
[27:50] jeremiah better obeyed because that's
[27:53] what the lord told him to do
[27:54] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[27:57] marred
[27:58] in the hand of the potter in other words
[28:00] there was a defect there was something
[28:02] wrong with it
[28:03] so get so look what happened so he made
[28:06] it
[28:06] made it made it again
[28:10] another vessel then choose another clay
[28:13] amen he made
[28:14] it again another vessel as seen good to
[28:17] the potter
[28:18] to make it then the word of the lord
[28:20] came to me saying house of israel cannot
[28:22] i do with you
[28:23] as this potter saith the lord behold as
[28:27] the clay is in the potter's hands
[28:29] so are ye in mine hand o house of
[28:32] israel amen and we know that you and i
[28:35] are spiritual israel amen
[28:37] so uh we take this word as if he's
[28:39] speaking to us as well
[28:41] in isaiah chapter 45 verses 8 through 9
[28:43] the bible says there drop down ye
[28:45] heavens from above
[28:46] and let the skies pour down
[28:48] righteousness let the earth open and let
[28:51] them bring forth salvation
[28:53] and let righteousness spring up together
[28:55] i the lord
[28:56] have created it woe unto him that
[28:59] striveth with his maker
[29:02] oh my in other words woe
[29:05] unto you you who strives with your maker
[29:10] the one who made you let the paw
[29:13] pots heard strive with the pot's herds
[29:16] of the earth shall the clay say to him
[29:20] that
[29:20] fashioned that what maketh thou
[29:23] or thy work he hath no hands
[29:26] in other words can the clay say to the
[29:29] one that's making it this form in it
[29:31] what are you doing yeah what in the
[29:34] world are you doing
[29:36] and and they can't amen so
[29:40] you may be seated this evening amen let
[29:43] me if i give this
[29:44] a title i want to title it the potter's
[29:47] wheel
[29:48] molds you to the potter's will
[29:51] say that again the potter's wheel molds
[29:54] you to the potter's
[29:55] will amen amen and so and so we see here
[29:59] in jeremiah a very familiar verse
[30:01] uh that jeremiah was asked to go and see
[30:05] about the and see this potter amen
[30:09] and here he was working on a piece of
[30:11] clay
[30:13] that probably was not anything to begin
[30:16] with
[30:16] nothing just something that came from
[30:18] the from from the
[30:19] ground from the from the earth
[30:23] and he when he when jeremiah got in
[30:25] there he was already working on it on
[30:26] this piece of clay
[30:28] amen he was already doing a work on it
[30:31] so uh when that's what jeremiah sees
[30:34] when he goes in there
[30:35] amen so uh and of course we
[30:38] we just read there what what what
[30:40] happened but
[30:42] i want us to think about for for just a
[30:44] moment because sometimes we
[30:46] we ask the lord and we we say lord i
[30:48] want your will to be done in my life
[30:52] i want i want uh i want your perfect
[30:55] will to be done
[30:56] in my life and and sometimes we even
[30:59] often
[30:59] we we we recite the the bible verse
[31:02] where jesus
[31:03] the lord's prayer where he says thy
[31:05] kingdom come
[31:06] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[31:09] heaven
[31:10] the thing is it's very dangerous to make
[31:12] that that prayer
[31:14] that's a very dangerous prayer to make
[31:17] because in
[31:18] reality if you do want god's will in
[31:20] your life
[31:21] you better get ready to get on his will
[31:26] if you really want god's will and your
[31:28] in your life and we know that god's will
[31:30] is his word if you really want to obey
[31:33] the word of god in your life
[31:35] and not do your own thing anymore then
[31:37] you better be prepared to get on god's
[31:39] will
[31:40] because that's where you're heading you
[31:42] see it's very important you want god's
[31:45] will oh i want the will of god in my
[31:46] life
[31:47] oh yes i do i want it with all my heart
[31:50] all right then
[31:51] there's going to be some tough times
[31:52] coming to you in your life
[31:54] in god's mind because god knows how
[31:56] sincere you are
[31:58] and and and sometimes when we're it
[32:00] seems like when we're doing the right
[32:02] thing
[32:02] then that's when things have start
[32:04] happening in our lives
[32:07] how many have felt that way how many
[32:10] have seen it to be that way
[32:13] is when you're doing the right thing and
[32:15] when you're trying to serve god when
[32:16] you're
[32:17] when everything seems to be crashing
[32:18] down upon you
[32:21] but god's fashioned it that way and
[32:22] god's made it that way because why he
[32:24] has an
[32:24] image and a purpose from the beginning
[32:27] amen
[32:28] of you and he knows exactly what you
[32:30] need in order to mold you into that
[32:32] image that he saw
[32:33] even before the foundation of the world
[32:35] amen
[32:36] and it's going to take lots of things
[32:38] amen to mold you into that image
[32:40] in that very image so you want his will
[32:43] you better be prepared to
[32:44] get on the potter's wheel you better get
[32:47] be prepared to be submitted to his word
[32:50] amen look what brother branham says in
[32:51] the message what is in that
[32:53] is that in your hand but the brand says
[32:55] that's the way the people today
[32:58] you don't like to get broke up
[33:02] you got to be broke up before you can be
[33:04] remade
[33:07] in other words you got to get out of
[33:09] your own
[33:10] self in order to be re uh reimaged
[33:13] into the image of god amen you know your
[33:16] image that
[33:17] can't can't be there anymore amen you
[33:19] have to take get out of your way
[33:21] you have to get self out of the way in
[33:23] order for you
[33:24] to get in god's way amen so you you
[33:28] don't
[33:29] we don't like to get broke up you know
[33:32] we don't like to we
[33:33] we don't like to get hurt we don't like
[33:35] to get marred we don't like to
[33:36] amen but that's what god uses in order
[33:39] for us to grow
[33:41] there's no better way amen i i don't
[33:44] find any other way to
[33:45] to to uh i mean even as you parents amen
[33:50] most of the time the best way to get the
[33:52] attention of the children is that
[33:53] you you punishment some way or another
[33:57] however you punish them
[33:59] usually it works maybe as they get older
[34:02] it doesn't work anymore but
[34:03] usually it works amen they listen
[34:06] and that's the same thing with god amen
[34:08] amen god
[34:10] knows how to deal exactly with you and
[34:12] knows exactly what he needs to do what
[34:14] buttons to push in order to mold you
[34:16] into his very image
[34:18] you got to be broke up before you can be
[34:20] remade the prophet went down to the
[34:21] potter's house to get broke up
[34:23] to get on the wheel and spun out
[34:25] something different
[34:27] if you're a sinner get on the wheel
[34:30] god will break you up mold you different
[34:34] shape your life up different what
[34:37] shape your home life different
[34:40] oh my your home life well we don't like
[34:44] it when people get in there
[34:46] but but but think about this saints you
[34:49] have to
[34:50] have your home life your home life
[34:55] in good condition if you want your home
[34:57] life to be in good condition
[34:59] to be led by god amen i've had people
[35:02] ask me i've had
[35:03] i've had parents tell me can you talk to
[35:05] my my son
[35:06] my my daughter uh you know she just
[35:09] doesn't listen or he doesn't listen
[35:12] and maybe you can give him a word of
[35:14] something that that you know might help
[35:16] them to stir them in the right direction
[35:18] and i'm thinking man you you need to get
[35:21] yourself
[35:22] your life straight you need you as the
[35:25] parent
[35:26] need to get straightened up first before
[35:27] i can say anything to your son or to
[35:29] your daughter
[35:30] and the one that was asking was was uh
[35:33] was was the mom
[35:34] and i said i said the home life the
[35:38] parents need to get right before you can
[35:39] be an example
[35:41] cause you want your whole you want your
[35:43] children to go
[35:44] and walk with god amen you must be
[35:46] walking with god
[35:48] you want your children to be faithful
[35:49] you better be faithful to god
[35:51] you want your your children to pray you
[35:53] want your children to you do that
[35:55] you do the praying and let them see that
[35:57] in your life
[35:58] amen praise god amen
[36:02] because it's very important we lead by
[36:04] examples
[36:06] we lead our children see what we do
[36:10] therefore they go amen and what we don't
[36:13] do they don't do
[36:15] amen but what we do usually they will
[36:18] follow
[36:19] amen jeremiah 18 so jeremiah 18
[36:23] looking back here in jeremiah 18. we see
[36:25] that jeremiah goes in here
[36:28] and we don't see the full picture of
[36:29] what's going on
[36:31] we don't see all we know is that he goes
[36:33] in there and he sees
[36:34] a potter on and has a vessel on a wheel
[36:38] and he's molding it right right but uh
[36:40] uh but there's a whole process that goes
[36:42] in
[36:43] into shaping a vessel and brother wade
[36:46] you might have seen this i mean because
[36:48] you worked in a potter
[36:49] pottery uh there's a whole process that
[36:52] goes in it
[36:53] and there's a science that goes in it
[36:55] behind it and just kind of reading about
[36:57] it and looking into it
[37:00] there's so many things that you can type
[37:02] in the spiritual life amen amen
[37:04] yeah and so that's why even god uses the
[37:07] potter and the clay
[37:09] as him representing the potter and us as
[37:11] the clay amen
[37:13] because we're nothing saints we come
[37:15] into this world speaking lies we come
[37:17] into this world
[37:18] nothing and if you think that you're
[37:20] something in this hour let me tell you
[37:21] you're nothing even saying that
[37:23] amen you're showing that you're nothing
[37:26] when you think that you're something
[37:28] right and you watch amen those that
[37:30] think that they're haughty
[37:31] those those that that feel that they're
[37:33] uh unstoppable
[37:35] you wait until god gets a hold of you
[37:38] and you realize that you're not as
[37:39] unstoppable as you think you are amen
[37:42] amen
[37:43] praise god so jeremiah 18 goes in and
[37:46] and and we see here um
[37:50] the potter's the the the process of the
[37:52] potter amen
[37:53] and so i want to talk about that here
[37:54] for just a moment and and then maybe in
[37:57] just a little bit i might show
[37:58] i might show a video so i'm trying to go
[38:01] a little quick here
[38:02] but this right here is the is the
[38:04] potter's process
[38:05] the traditional way of how a potter
[38:08] makes makes a
[38:09] because i mean i know that and i know
[38:11] like i think kaylee and zoe they're
[38:12] doing pottery
[38:13] and there's probably they have they
[38:15] there's the way that they probably doing
[38:17] it now
[38:18] and i'm sure i don't know how you guys
[38:20] are not going out there digging mud
[38:22] outside outside or anything like that
[38:24] are you
[38:25] that's probably not what they're doing
[38:27] and you don't have like a
[38:28] like a brick oven that you're putting
[38:30] you know the pottery in or anything like
[38:32] that
[38:32] i doubt it things now are different now
[38:36] amen but so so and when i'm speaking
[38:38] about this right now i'm thinking about
[38:40] it in the way that they used to do it
[38:41] amen
[38:42] so always keep this in mind that the
[38:45] potter before he goes out there and
[38:47] starts
[38:48] he has an end goal in mind amen amen he
[38:51] has already a vision
[38:53] of of what he wants to do amen and
[38:56] that's the same thing with god in this
[38:57] hour
[38:58] even before the foundation of the world
[39:00] he knew you before the foundation of the
[39:02] world
[39:04] and he predestinated you amen amen
[39:08] see he knew all things amen
[39:11] but especially those of the uh his
[39:13] children he knew them amen
[39:15] because he knew that they were going to
[39:16] hear his own life amen look what
[39:18] jeremiah 29 11 says for i
[39:20] know the thoughts that are up that i
[39:22] think toward you saith the lord
[39:24] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[39:27] what to give you
[39:29] an expected end
[39:32] so everything that happens in your life
[39:34] amen is expected to happen in your life
[39:37] amen
[39:38] because god already foresaw it before
[39:40] the foundation of the world and that's
[39:41] something we can rest on saints
[39:44] amen ultimately as i've been speaking
[39:47] about
[39:47] uh you know uh regarding god you know we
[39:50] all have free moral agency
[39:53] and our life is shaped in the decisions
[39:55] that we make
[39:56] amen but god predestinated us
[39:59] amen amen and if you're to come to god
[40:02] amen god's going to make a way for you
[40:04] to come to him
[40:05] he's not going to leave you drive
[40:07] because because why his word is very
[40:09] important
[40:09] his thoughts are very important and he's
[40:11] not going to let those go
[40:13] amen he cares he cares more about his
[40:16] word than anything else
[40:18] and to fulfill that word and to fulfill
[40:20] it in your life
[40:21] amen praise god amen so so
[40:24] i i've always thought ever since i was
[40:27] young this
[40:27] this verse here jeremiah 29 11 has given
[40:30] me comfort for i know the thoughts that
[40:32] i think toward you
[40:33] seth who saith the lord amen
[40:36] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[40:39] give you
[40:41] an expected end to god there's no
[40:43] surprises in your in your life
[40:46] there's nothing that happens in your
[40:47] life that god says oh my goodness i did
[40:50] not know that was going to take place
[40:52] in brother john's life on brother boyd's
[40:55] life
[40:56] what am i to do now he doesn't say that
[41:00] we say that that's right amen we say
[41:03] that and we get frustrated and we don't
[41:04] know what to do
[41:05] amen but god never says that and god
[41:08] wants us to realize that
[41:09] amen and the way we realize that is to
[41:12] just have peace and confidence in his
[41:14] word
[41:14] amen there's nothing better than that to
[41:17] give us peace than his word amen
[41:20] so when the potter goes out and he
[41:22] starts looking he has
[41:23] he has an image in mind of a vessel that
[41:26] he wants to create
[41:28] and so what he does is he goes out and
[41:30] he starts looking for the clay now
[41:32] i believe that there's specific clays
[41:34] that they're that there's that they're
[41:35] looking for
[41:36] well but let's say he goes out takes a
[41:40] shovel
[41:41] and starts digging in this area and
[41:43] starts taking it and putting it back
[41:46] near his his his house
[41:49] right or taking it in in his house or
[41:51] near his house
[41:53] because why it needs to be in the
[41:54] general and the near vicinity of where
[41:56] he's at
[41:57] amen it can't be further away it can't
[41:59] be a somewhere else amen it's got to be
[42:01] near the potter's house
[42:03] amen and sometimes he uses amen that
[42:06] shovel is to me it's like the the
[42:08] evangelist that comes through
[42:10] amen and he shovels and and and
[42:13] and and he's digging in there amen and
[42:16] and it's making us making us come out
[42:18] and making us jump making us
[42:20] amen but that is what god does amen in
[42:22] order to
[42:23] in order to bring us closer to his house
[42:25] amen
[42:27] closer to his house because he's not
[42:29] going to
[42:30] he's not going to call you shovel you
[42:32] out and then
[42:33] put you back where you where you were
[42:34] left amen no he's not going to do that
[42:37] that's not how his ministry works
[42:39] he pulls you out to take you closer to
[42:42] his house that's the reason why saints
[42:44] that when you come out of the world
[42:45] there's there has to be a difference
[42:48] when you say that you're justified amen
[42:50] that your sins have been forgiven
[42:53] you can't go back to those same sins
[42:55] obviously god is doing the work
[42:57] in our lives and and and and we we
[43:00] struggle we we have
[43:02] we have our faults and we're striving
[43:04] amen
[43:05] but in your heart you better not want to
[43:07] go back to those things
[43:09] amen if god is really the one who's
[43:11] pulling you out of that dirt
[43:13] out of that mire you see because
[43:15] sometimes i believe that that that you
[43:17] know we we go to meetings and this has
[43:18] happened
[43:19] i've seen it i've seen it out in the in
[43:21] the mission field
[43:23] you know in youth camps and things like
[43:25] that you see
[43:26] you see the young people or or people
[43:28] come up to the altar and you can see
[43:30] that they're really sincere
[43:32] and then a year later right you see them
[43:35] the the the the profession that they
[43:38] made
[43:39] and the sincerity and the crime that
[43:40] they did and then you don't see them
[43:43] there
[43:44] you see you and you notice and you see
[43:46] it because you see it on facebook
[43:47] usually
[43:48] that's where you see it something
[43:50] changed right
[43:52] the thing that they were there crying
[43:53] about is not there anymore in their life
[43:59] so we want to be and it's because they
[44:00] were not near they probably did not stay
[44:02] close into the potter's house amen
[44:04] for him to continue molding amen so look
[44:07] what isaiah
[44:08] uh so to me that potter he needs to go
[44:11] down and find
[44:12] a piece of clay and you know clay and
[44:14] mud is not clean
[44:17] you were not clean when god picked you
[44:19] out of the out of the out of the
[44:21] dirt out of the worldly dirt you were
[44:23] not clean i was not clean amen none of
[44:25] us were clean
[44:27] none of us are clean the bible says in
[44:29] isaiah 64 it says but we
[44:31] are all as unclean thing
[44:35] and all our unrighteousness are as
[44:37] filthy rags
[44:39] and we all do fade as a leaf and our
[44:41] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[44:43] away
[44:44] and there is none that calleth upon the
[44:46] name that stirreth up
[44:47] himself to take hold of thee for thou
[44:50] has hid thy face from us and has
[44:52] consumed us
[44:53] because of our iniquities amen see god
[44:56] to god amen he hates sin
[44:58] he can't be around sin amen
[45:01] but now oh lord thou art our father
[45:04] verse 8
[45:05] says we are the clay and thou are potter
[45:07] amen
[45:08] and we are all the work of thy hand amen
[45:12] praise god so each and every one of us
[45:14] come with a defect in our lives
[45:17] we all came to this life needing
[45:20] salvation
[45:22] amen we didn't come save we didn't come
[45:24] with anything in
[45:25] in us that was that was perfect a seed
[45:28] or nothing of that sort
[45:29] you had to receive the seed here amen
[45:33] and the seed is the word of god amen
[45:38] and so that is from when you receive
[45:40] that and then it starts working on to
[45:42] the outside amen
[45:43] so when god takes you up amen that's a
[45:45] form of justification
[45:47] amen see you god cleanse god you you
[45:50] just get
[45:51] you ask god to forgive you for your sins
[45:53] lord i've done wrong
[45:54] i'm a sinner i i know that i can't make
[45:57] it on my own because you cannot amen if
[46:00] god didn't make a way for you
[46:02] then there wouldn't be any way there
[46:04] wouldn't be any way
[46:06] praise god jesus said that it's the sick
[46:09] that need a doctor
[46:11] and not the ones that are well right hey
[46:13] man see the potter the butter he's not
[46:15] interested in stuffed shirts
[46:19] he's not interested in stuff those
[46:21] stuffed with religion
[46:24] he can't use them that kind of clay he
[46:26] can't use it's it's too it's too
[46:28] overstuffed it's got too much stuff in
[46:30] it
[46:30] amen but he wants to use one that he
[46:33] sees that there's some sort of form of
[46:34] pliability in there amen
[46:36] that's the kind of clay that he wants to
[46:38] use amen
[46:41] so the clay is shoveled out amen and and
[46:45] and it's placed into near the potter's
[46:47] house now the clay after that
[46:49] is prepared amen and
[46:52] uh this is what i call the the the
[46:55] sanctification
[46:56] process amen because after that the clay
[46:59] needs to be washed amen this clay that
[47:03] has been picked out from the ground that
[47:05] has been picked up from the earth
[47:07] now needs to be washed and it's washed
[47:10] with what
[47:12] gasoline it's washed with
[47:16] water amen with the water of the word is
[47:20] the only way that you're going to be
[47:21] washed in this hour
[47:24] that is how you're going to be
[47:25] sanctified amen
[47:27] that is how things are going to come off
[47:29] of your life as you hear the word
[47:31] in your life amen the word will be
[47:34] revealed to you
[47:36] as you open yourself to the word
[47:38] obviously if you don't open yourself to
[47:40] the word the word will not be revealed
[47:42] to you
[47:42] but when you open yourself to go to god
[47:44] and open yourself to the word and you
[47:46] say lord reveal your word unto me
[47:48] amen i'm gonna promise you you're not
[47:50] gonna fall asleep at church
[47:52] i'm gonna promise you that you won't you
[47:54] won't think that church services are
[47:56] boring amen
[47:57] amen i'ma promise you that you're gonna
[48:00] enjoy the word of god
[48:02] praise god because why you want the word
[48:05] to
[48:06] wash you amen so as this clay amen is
[48:09] here
[48:09] the potter takes this clay and puts it
[48:11] in a reservoir amen
[48:13] and in this reservoir he's there
[48:15] cleaning it he's there washing it
[48:16] amen and then he takes this clay and he
[48:19] puts it up in another in another
[48:22] reservoir
[48:23] so that the clay can uh uh um what's the
[48:26] word i i used here
[48:27] it can start it can start to it starts
[48:30] leaving lumps and sticks and things left
[48:32] left behind stones and things that they
[48:34] had in it amen it starts filtering
[48:36] that's right
[48:37] it starts being filtered and it's and
[48:40] it's left there
[48:42] see but it had to start with the word
[48:45] it has to start with the water amen it
[48:48] has to start with the going
[48:50] to church amen it has to start with
[48:53] reading your own bible amen praise god
[48:57] it has to start that way amen amen i
[48:59] remember when i came to the lord amen
[49:00] when i was 12 years old and
[49:02] and i first heard about salvation and
[49:04] and i came to the lord jesus i accepted
[49:06] him i
[49:07] said lord i'm i'm a sinner i repent and
[49:10] and and
[49:11] the first thing that that i wanted to do
[49:12] was get in the word of god
[49:15] amen i didn't understand anything i
[49:17] didn't understand only that jesus christ
[49:19] died for my sins
[49:21] but in the process of getting in the
[49:22] word i started to understand more and
[49:24] more about the word
[49:26] and the and people say i don't
[49:28] understand the word but you're not going
[49:29] to
[49:30] understand it when you don't get in it
[49:35] you just you if you don't get in the
[49:36] word on your own
[49:38] amen you have to get in the word amen
[49:41] you have to let that word wash
[49:43] praise god so this clay is washed with
[49:45] water and it's stirred
[49:47] amen until it becomes this mush amen
[49:50] and and then and and and this bush is
[49:53] then placed in these settling tanks
[49:55] where all these sticks and stones and
[49:57] lumps are left behind
[49:59] amen and so that's the process of
[50:00] sanctifications where it starts
[50:02] amen and the clay has left their setting
[50:06] sometimes
[50:06] for about six months
[50:10] for about six months it's sitting there
[50:14] just being sanctified
[50:19] and you're and maybe in those six months
[50:21] and you know you're what you're hoping
[50:22] you're
[50:22] man when am i gonna get to start
[50:24] preaching
[50:26] when am i going to get started playing
[50:27] the piano at church when am i going to
[50:29] start doing this then the other and god
[50:31] says you're not ready yet
[50:35] you're not ready you're still in the
[50:36] process of being sanctified
[50:38] amen how many how many preachers have
[50:41] have come to
[50:42] to preach the word amen to that that
[50:44] they feel that desire to preach the
[50:46] gospel they preach
[50:47] the word amen and when they and they
[50:50] start amen because they weren't
[50:51] truly called and they make a big mess
[50:54] out of it
[50:55] amen amen see it has to be something
[50:58] that has to be proved and tried amen
[51:01] your life has to be has to be in a
[51:03] certain point a certain check amen
[51:05] before god can put you
[51:06] because remember you're not even on the
[51:08] potter's wheel not yet
[51:11] you're not even on the potter's wheel
[51:12] yet the funda hasn't even really started
[51:15] yet
[51:16] amen praise god so you're left there for
[51:18] six months amen this
[51:20] what this does it helps to make the clay
[51:22] more pliable
[51:25] [Music]
[51:26] it's put in the shell for six months so
[51:29] that you can become more pliable
[51:31] so that you are are you willing to come
[51:33] to church when you're supposed to come
[51:34] to church are you willing to read the
[51:36] word when you when you should read the
[51:38] word
[51:39] are you willing to listen to the message
[51:40] just doing the simple things can you do
[51:42] those simple things
[51:43] before you say you come over here and
[51:45] you have a gift to call a call to preach
[51:46] amen that's right we're called to do
[51:49] something in church or something like
[51:50] that right
[51:51] can you even do the simple things that's
[51:54] what those six months are for them
[51:57] just types but very interesting
[52:00] amen and now after these six months
[52:06] the potter then he grabs a mallet
[52:09] he takes the he takes the clay and he
[52:11] start and
[52:12] he puts is get ready to start working on
[52:14] it and he takes a mallet and starts
[52:17] beating around it
[52:18] amen and this is for this is the re this
[52:21] is
[52:21] to take all the air bubbles out of the
[52:24] clay
[52:24] amen take all air bubbles out of the
[52:27] clay now see
[52:28] you think oh my i've been good lord all
[52:31] these six months i've been waiting on
[52:33] you i've been praying i've been going to
[52:34] church i've been
[52:35] then he takes you oh yes lord oh i feel
[52:37] an anointing i feel something
[52:39] you're doing something in my life and
[52:40] here he comes with the spiritual mallet
[52:42] yeah and something happens in your life
[52:47] something that you're weird you're not
[52:48] you're not you're not expecting
[52:50] but god knew before the foundation of
[52:52] the world
[52:54] because you still have spiritual air
[52:56] bubbles in your life that need to be
[52:57] taken out
[52:59] remember you still not yet placed on the
[53:01] wheel
[53:02] he's just beating that thing
[53:06] getting it ready because he wants to put
[53:09] it on the wheel
[53:10] the thing is is that and the clay can't
[53:12] say anything
[53:14] no no no i don't want that mallard on me
[53:16] no
[53:17] you want me to shape you right let me
[53:20] continue beating
[53:23] and all air bubbles have to be out
[53:25] praise god
[53:26] amen praise god and you know saints
[53:31] as i said earlier you know oftentimes
[53:33] it's
[53:34] when we think that we're doing the right
[53:36] thing and when we're we're serving the
[53:38] lord
[53:38] it's when god says all right it looks
[53:40] like they're ready for a trial
[53:43] looks like they're ready for something
[53:45] in their life amen
[53:47] because i know what they need in order
[53:49] for them to to move on praise god
[53:52] he's not going to kill us he knows that
[53:56] he's not going to kill us
[53:57] we think that he is by the things that
[53:59] happen in our lives we think that he's
[54:01] trying to kill us
[54:02] but he's not going to kill us all he is
[54:04] is he's using that tool which is satan
[54:08] he's using that tool to shape and thick
[54:10] things out of our lives
[54:12] brother branham said that say all satan
[54:14] is is just the tool in god's hand
[54:17] that's all he is you say satan is after
[54:20] me
[54:20] oh my but you don't you don't understand
[54:23] god allows satan to be after you
[54:26] to take those spiritual air bubbles out
[54:28] of your life
[54:29] you still have a little bit of you in
[54:31] there that needs to be taken out and you
[54:33] know why those air bubbles need to be
[54:35] taken out from the clay
[54:37] because if you if you don't have air
[54:39] bubbles out amen see
[54:40] i used to i when i worked at papa john's
[54:42] pizza
[54:43] and i and i and i and i used to work
[54:46] with the dough and
[54:47] started work you know before we before
[54:49] we even started doing the spinning and
[54:51] all that kind of stuff and i would tell
[54:52] you that was fun
[54:54] spinning that doe and doing tricks and
[54:56] stuff like that that was fun man we gave
[54:58] a show on friday nights
[55:00] there to the customers and it was it was
[55:02] fun back in the day i don't even know if
[55:04] they do that now but
[55:08] but before you even get to even
[55:11] work with the mold and start putting
[55:12] toppings on the pizza you have to make
[55:14] sure that there's no air bubbles on the
[55:16] dough
[55:17] you see make sure they're all air
[55:19] bubbles out because eventually when the
[55:21] those air bubbles and the pizza that are
[55:23] in that dough get in the oven and
[55:25] it's going to cause a mess there's going
[55:28] to burst it's going to crack
[55:29] that's why you when sometimes when you
[55:30] get your pizza and there's like a big
[55:32] old hole
[55:32] up and around the crust the air bubble
[55:35] wasn't completely taken out
[55:37] you see and i would have gotten in
[55:39] trouble if a pizza came out like that in
[55:40] papa john's
[55:43] so so this is what happens amen with
[55:46] this clay
[55:46] all air bubbles have to be taken out
[55:48] amen
[55:50] now the clay then is finally placed
[55:53] on the wheel amen how many are still
[55:56] with me
[55:57] amen you need to stand up
[56:01] okay i'll make you stand up amen praise
[56:05] god
[56:06] praise god so the clay is finally going
[56:09] to be placed on the wheel now
[56:11] if you've seen a traditional wheel uh uh
[56:15] the way there's a big old wheel down at
[56:17] the bottom
[56:18] and then there's a there's a shaft up in
[56:20] the middle and then is a it's attached
[56:22] to another wheel at the top
[56:24] i don't know if that's the kind of
[56:25] wheels that you and you
[56:27] you girls are doing but that's the
[56:29] original way
[56:31] the weight is that is that correct
[56:35] and so and so the potter he uses his
[56:37] feet
[56:38] to turn the wheel at the bottom all
[56:41] right
[56:42] and as he's turning that wheel at the
[56:44] bottom it's causing the wheel at the top
[56:46] to move as well and i think it's moving
[56:48] the other way
[56:50] if i'm not mistaken see here look at me
[56:55] so clockwise okay
[56:58] so as so he's turning that wheel amen
[57:00] and it's causing that upper wheel to
[57:02] move and so on the upper wheel
[57:04] that's where he pose he puts the piece
[57:06] of clay i mean i think of these wheels
[57:08] and just looking at this i'm thinking
[57:10] you know what
[57:10] there's the word of god amen and it's
[57:13] connected to the message
[57:15] amen and as the word of god is turning
[57:17] the message has to be turning as well
[57:19] amen they don't contradict each other
[57:23] you see the message in the bible
[57:26] they they they don't contradict they are
[57:28] saying the exact same thing it
[57:30] it's it's the people that make it seem
[57:32] like it's it's contrary
[57:34] amen it's the people that think that
[57:36] there is something
[57:37] contrary or there is something wrong
[57:40] with the word of god but in reality it's
[57:42] them amen
[57:43] or that something is wrong with the
[57:45] message but in reality it's them amen
[57:47] amen see that's the reason why we need
[57:49] revelation in our lives we need
[57:50] spiritual revelation in our lives
[57:52] to put these things together because yes
[57:55] it's very
[57:56] it's very uh a lot of things that
[57:58] brother branham said amen
[57:59] that's the reason why you have to study
[58:00] and read the word amen and come to
[58:03] church listen to the word
[58:04] and it helps us god the holy spirit will
[58:06] help us to put two and two together
[58:08] amen to make sense of the message
[58:11] which is tied to the word amen praise
[58:14] god
[58:14] so there there are these two stones amen
[58:17] the word and the message both working
[58:18] together in order to mold you
[58:21] amen and so finally the clay is placed
[58:25] on that upper wheel
[58:26] amen and that clay and the potter starts
[58:29] spinning that
[58:30] that that wheel at the top and so the
[58:31] clay starts going
[58:33] amen and it just seems like that that
[58:35] you're that as it's going it looks like
[58:37] the clay is out of control
[58:40] like it like it's like it's going out of
[58:42] control
[58:44] but you see that's at that's at that
[58:45] point amen that that
[58:47] that the the potter he starts taking his
[58:50] hands and starts
[58:52] working on it as he's spinning it amen
[58:55] he's got complete control of it see in
[58:57] your life it might seem like it's
[58:58] completely out of control
[59:00] but in reality let me tell you what if
[59:02] you're still alive
[59:03] if you're still breathing in this hour
[59:05] if you woke up this morning
[59:07] god's got control of your life god's got
[59:10] mercy on your life god's got grace on
[59:13] your life amen
[59:14] if you are still here right living and
[59:17] breathing in this
[59:18] hour so that means his hands are on you
[59:21] his hands are still on you even though
[59:23] it seems like the thing is going
[59:25] and i don't know where i'm going oh god
[59:27] help me
[59:28] but god is in full control his hands are
[59:32] on you amen
[59:33] rest assured that his hands aren't on
[59:35] you the whole time
[59:37] it may not feel like it but he's got his
[59:40] hands on you
[59:41] this is like the song goes he's got the
[59:42] whole world in his hands
[59:45] praise god amen so now i want to get
[59:48] into something here for just a moment
[59:49] and and i'll show you here
[59:51] uh uh a a video here in just a moment
[59:54] no so of what happens when the clay
[59:57] starts spinning
[59:58] so he starts using his hands amen starts
[1:00:01] using his hands
[1:00:03] amen how many fingers do we have in our
[1:00:05] hands
[1:00:07] amen five he starts taking in and
[1:00:10] spinning it's the it's the word and the
[1:00:11] message together and your life is
[1:00:13] spinning
[1:00:14] all you know you're going to church
[1:00:15] you're doing everything that you're
[1:00:16] supposed to do god's
[1:00:17] doing a work in your life you're going
[1:00:19] to school you're going to work
[1:00:21] things are happening in your life you
[1:00:23] have to pay car insurance you have to do
[1:00:25] all these different things you know your
[1:00:26] life is turning amen
[1:00:28] and god is putting everything all the
[1:00:30] pieces together
[1:00:31] everything together he's molding you
[1:00:32] amen and here comes his
[1:00:34] he's got his whole five hands all ten
[1:00:37] hands oh ten fingers
[1:00:38] on you amen each each hand has five
[1:00:41] fingers amen
[1:00:42] and so to me i i typed that as the
[1:00:44] five-fold ministry
[1:00:46] amen the five-fold ministry amen
[1:00:49] every time you come and hear the word of
[1:00:51] god you're hearing it through the
[1:00:52] five-fold ministry
[1:00:54] amen and the faithful ministry is there
[1:00:56] what to perfect
[1:00:58] isn't what the the word of god says amen
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:01] again and i say it's not the faithful
[1:01:03] ministry but it's the holy spirit amen
[1:01:05] through the faithful ministry
[1:01:07] that should be connecting to the same
[1:01:09] holy spirit that you have
[1:01:11] amen should be the same holy spirit
[1:01:14] we're just we're not the ones who just
[1:01:16] have the holy spirit you have to have
[1:01:17] that same spirit in your life
[1:01:20] because there's times when the whole
[1:01:21] when the fivefold ministry is not around
[1:01:25] what are you gonna do amen you've got
[1:01:28] god and you've got that word that he's
[1:01:29] given you amen
[1:01:31] praise god and he said he will lead you
[1:01:34] and guide you
[1:01:35] unto all truth amen each finger has a
[1:01:38] specific purpose
[1:01:40] in helping shape the clay amen and you
[1:01:43] cannot
[1:01:43] discount neither one right you can't
[1:01:47] discount neither one of those
[1:01:48] one i mean you can't say i don't need
[1:01:50] the teacher and i don't need the
[1:01:52] evangelist i don't need
[1:01:53] amen you need all of them in order to
[1:01:56] grow amen
[1:01:57] in order to grow you need all of the
[1:01:59] faithful ministry now some of some of
[1:02:01] the five-fold
[1:02:03] one of them is going to speak to you
[1:02:04] more then
[1:02:06] then another one amen in order for you
[1:02:08] to grow
[1:02:09] amen for you to be molded amen but you
[1:02:12] need each and every one of them amen
[1:02:14] absolutely need each one of them so
[1:02:15] there's the potter's hands they're all
[1:02:17] over that
[1:02:18] that vessel that piece of clay and you
[1:02:20] know what the potter is doing hey man
[1:02:22] he's
[1:02:22] using upward pressure he's using
[1:02:25] upward pressure in order to shape the
[1:02:28] clay
[1:02:29] isn't that what you do zoe kaylie
[1:02:34] using upward pressure amen in order to
[1:02:38] to to get the the the shape of the clay
[1:02:41] amen and you know what god is doing he's
[1:02:43] trying to
[1:02:44] enlarge he's trying to make the capacity
[1:02:47] of that vessel
[1:02:48] larger as he's doing that amen he's
[1:02:51] trying to get the capacity of it
[1:02:53] he wants to make it he wants to make it
[1:02:55] nice and round and nice and
[1:02:57] where a lot of god can fit in there
[1:03:00] amen but he's using lots of upward
[1:03:03] pressure
[1:03:04] and it might hurt it might hurt
[1:03:07] yeah it doesn't feel good yeah you know
[1:03:10] sometimes my my wife massages me and on
[1:03:13] my back and
[1:03:14] and i'm almost like man i don't want a
[1:03:16] massage from you it hurts
[1:03:20] well she and and she loves it when i do
[1:03:22] it i'm just there
[1:03:23] pow pow and she thinks it's the greatest
[1:03:25] thing in the world
[1:03:27] i i i to me it hurts i like those
[1:03:31] those those nights where where like you
[1:03:32] know just those swedish massages you
[1:03:34] know
[1:03:36] when you're getting that deep tissue
[1:03:37] thing oh man that really really hurts
[1:03:40] but you see that's what the the potter
[1:03:42] is doing to this clay
[1:03:44] doing that deep tissue massage you know
[1:03:47] getting all in there amen but because
[1:03:49] it's made and it's forming something
[1:03:51] you're going to see in a video here in
[1:03:52] just a moment if you've never seen the
[1:03:54] process it's really
[1:03:55] it's really neat it's really neat so god
[1:03:58] god is trying to enlarge
[1:03:59] our capacity and and you know what
[1:04:01] saints without this pressure they're
[1:04:04] not this will will not be accomplished
[1:04:08] you will not have that capacity of to
[1:04:10] have more of god without the pressure in
[1:04:12] your life
[1:04:14] see whoever told you that that the
[1:04:16] christian life was going to be a
[1:04:18] be a flower bed of ease they they lied
[1:04:20] to you
[1:04:22] that you're that it's simple to serve
[1:04:24] god
[1:04:26] it's difficult amen but as i always say
[1:04:29] it's worth it
[1:04:31] it's always worth it amen because who
[1:04:34] else can we turn to
[1:04:36] he's the one who has the words of
[1:04:38] eternal life
[1:04:39] amen you don't find the words of eternal
[1:04:41] life in in the in the in the world
[1:04:43] in the music of the world you don't find
[1:04:45] the words of eternal life and
[1:04:46] billy eilish or anything of that amen
[1:04:48] you find
[1:04:49] the words of eternal life in the word of
[1:04:52] god amen
[1:04:54] second corinthians chapter 4 verse 16
[1:04:56] says for which
[1:04:57] cause we faint not but though our
[1:05:00] outward man perish yet the inward man is
[1:05:02] renewed
[1:05:03] day by day listen to this for our light
[1:05:07] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:05:10] you see the things that we go through
[1:05:14] the struggles and the problems that we
[1:05:17] go through in our life
[1:05:18] there for a moment
[1:05:22] see to god a day is like a thousand
[1:05:24] years and a thousand years is like a day
[1:05:28] so it's big for us but it's not big for
[1:05:31] him
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:37] for our light affliction which is but
[1:05:39] for a moment worketh for us
[1:05:43] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:05:46] of glory
[1:05:48] luke 21 verse 27 says and then shall
[1:05:51] they see the son of man coming in a
[1:05:53] cloud with power and great glory
[1:05:57] and when these things begin to come to
[1:05:59] pass
[1:06:00] then look up and lift up your heads for
[1:06:03] your redemption draweth nigh
[1:06:05] when you start seeing that pressure in
[1:06:07] your life and things in your life and
[1:06:09] you know that you're walking with god
[1:06:11] and
[1:06:11] amen this is where you need to be
[1:06:13] looking up right
[1:06:15] because your redemption is drawing now
[1:06:19] if you're suffering in your life and
[1:06:20] even paul says this if you're suffering
[1:06:22] in your life
[1:06:22] for things that you are doing that are
[1:06:25] wrong
[1:06:26] that's the consequences of your own
[1:06:28] foolishness you need to suffer those
[1:06:30] things
[1:06:31] but if you're suffering for doing right
[1:06:34] amen not
[1:06:35] for one those things are molding you
[1:06:37] molding your character
[1:06:39] and two is telling you hey you're doing
[1:06:41] the right thing
[1:06:42] you're in the right way amen praise god
[1:06:46] so i if things are going very smooth in
[1:06:49] your life you better be thinking lord
[1:06:51] what am i what am i doing wrong
[1:06:53] what am i doing wrong lord show me
[1:06:57] and sometimes when we think we got
[1:06:58] everything all in order and everything
[1:07:00] like that
[1:07:01] all of a sudden that transmission blows
[1:07:02] out in your car
[1:07:06] the water heater starts leaking in in
[1:07:08] your basement
[1:07:09] the roof all of a sudden god sends
[1:07:12] hurricane after hurricane or allows
[1:07:13] hurricane after hurricane to just fly
[1:07:15] right over your roof
[1:07:17] and leaks start going right through your
[1:07:19] roof
[1:07:20] oh my goodness believe me it's happened
[1:07:25] i don't know what it's like when you
[1:07:27] think everything is just fine and dandy
[1:07:29] amen that's when you need to worry
[1:07:31] amen amen so now
[1:07:36] there's a there's a transition here that
[1:07:38] i want to talk about here for just a
[1:07:39] moment
[1:07:40] there's a transition as the clay is
[1:07:42] spinning
[1:07:43] again we're going to watch this here in
[1:07:44] just a moment
[1:07:46] well actually i'm going to ask brother
[1:07:48] joe can you go ahead and cue that up
[1:07:51] or brother anderson but
[1:07:54] this transition here and just pause it
[1:07:56] here for just a moment but in this
[1:07:58] transition right here
[1:08:00] as the clay is spinning see he's working
[1:08:02] on it on the outside right
[1:08:04] as it's spinning and then all of a
[1:08:06] sudden he starts to take it and starts
[1:08:08] to work in the middle of it
[1:08:11] i mean just just i it's still spinning
[1:08:14] the whole thing is spinning
[1:08:15] but then there's a transition where he
[1:08:17] starts working in it in the middle
[1:08:19] and that's where the process of it where
[1:08:21] he starts working of it on it in the
[1:08:23] heart
[1:08:24] amen in the heart now i'm going to show
[1:08:27] this video here real quick
[1:08:28] brother brother joe we could play and i
[1:08:30] think they have volume
[1:08:31] to it there are four basic steps
[1:08:34] in throwing a pot on the potter's wheel
[1:08:36] each of them shows something about us
[1:08:38] and god step one balance the clay
[1:08:42] the technique is called centering the
[1:08:44] whole purpose of this step is to bring
[1:08:46] the clay to the point of workability
[1:08:49] if the piece loses its balance often the
[1:08:52] potter must begin again
[1:08:53] the potter's hands are both placed on
[1:08:55] the clay his left arm is firmly wedged
[1:08:57] against his body and his left hand
[1:09:00] is against the closest part of the
[1:09:01] spinning clay his right hand is on the
[1:09:04] far side clay
[1:09:05] the clay flows between his hands now the
[1:09:08] grip becomes firmer and the right hand
[1:09:10] moves toward the left
[1:09:12] as the clay responds his hands move up
[1:09:14] or down as needed
[1:09:16] the clay fights back suddenly the
[1:09:18] struggle is over
[1:09:19] and the ball of clay is balanced god as
[1:09:22] the potter
[1:09:23] is seeking balance in your life he wants
[1:09:25] to center you
[1:09:27] you will be at rest when does god stop
[1:09:30] the sintering process
[1:09:32] when the struggle ceases when you rest
[1:09:34] in the potter's hand
[1:09:36] step two the clay is opened in order to
[1:09:39] open the clay the potter must find the
[1:09:41] center of the clay
[1:09:43] he does this by first taking just a few
[1:09:45] dribbles of water and letting it flow
[1:09:47] over the clay
[1:09:48] then he places both hands on the sides
[1:09:51] of the clay with his thumbs gently
[1:09:52] riding on the upper surface
[1:09:54] and then as the clay is spun his thumbs
[1:09:57] again very gently
[1:09:59] ride the surface of the clay to the
[1:10:01] center of the spin
[1:10:02] as he reaches the center his thumbs
[1:10:04] stiffen and carefully push
[1:10:06] downward a small indentation is now at
[1:10:09] the very center of the clay
[1:10:10] leaving one hand to remain along the
[1:10:12] side of the clay
[1:10:13] the potter takes his other hand and
[1:10:15] places his forefingers in the
[1:10:17] indentation and pushes down
[1:10:19] the goal is not to dig the clay out but
[1:10:22] to move the clay
[1:10:23] the clay if it has been centered
[1:10:25] correctly opens creating thick walls
[1:10:27] between his thumb and the remaining
[1:10:29] fingers
[1:10:30] the lump of clay is now a vessel the
[1:10:32] change has begun
[1:10:34] the potter then rechecks it for balance
[1:10:37] now he is ready to move to create a
[1:10:39] strong base
[1:10:40] he takes one of his sponges and cleans
[1:10:42] out the interior of the spinning clay
[1:10:44] to be open before the lord means that
[1:10:46] you are now willing to be controlled
[1:10:49] you are open as his vessel step
[1:10:52] three the clay is lifted up once the
[1:10:55] clay is opened the potter quickly moves
[1:10:57] to lift the clay into a tall cylinder
[1:11:00] this is the beginning of the fragile
[1:11:01] stages of the pot's formation
[1:11:04] the clay is fragile because during the
[1:11:06] lifting of the clay the walls are
[1:11:08] thinned
[1:11:08] as the potter pushes upward the clay
[1:11:11] begins to rise
[1:11:12] both hands cause and follow this
[1:11:14] movement
[1:11:15] like a wave moving toward the shore the
[1:11:17] clay moves upward
[1:11:18] growing always rising the aim of the
[1:11:21] potter is not to force the clay but to
[1:11:23] grow the moving clay towards a single
[1:11:25] point
[1:11:26] when the inside of the cylinder is
[1:11:28] growing correctly the outside takes care
[1:11:30] of itself
[1:11:31] remember peter's words so be humble
[1:11:34] under god's powerful hand
[1:11:36] then he will lift you up when the right
[1:11:38] turn comes
[1:11:39] first peter 5 6 god by his mercy over
[1:11:42] your life
[1:11:43] has caused your heart to be open to his
[1:11:45] plan now release yourself to be lifted
[1:11:48] up
[1:11:48] he will focus on the inside of you and
[1:11:50] then he will present you
[1:11:52] ready to be shaped for your final
[1:11:53] calling step 4
[1:11:55] shaping the clay the tall cylinder spins
[1:11:58] before the potter
[1:11:59] it is ready to be shaped the shaping of
[1:12:02] the clay is where the art of the artist
[1:12:04] is truly seen it is the time when the
[1:12:06] potter slows the wheel down
[1:12:08] and spins very specific detailed time
[1:12:10] with the clay
[1:12:11] in fact the clay stands very fragile in
[1:12:13] the potter's hands
[1:12:15] the slightest wrong movement from the
[1:12:16] potter will result in a full collapse of
[1:12:18] the pot
[1:12:19] his eyes never leave the clay slowly
[1:12:22] very slowly the clay takes the shape the
[1:12:24] potter has in mind
[1:12:26] each stroke in shaping is small
[1:12:29] sometimes when the potter looks into the
[1:12:30] pot the water in the base reflects his
[1:12:33] face
[1:12:33] the potter sees himself as the clay is
[1:12:36] shaped now
[1:12:37] instead of a cylinder there is a foot a
[1:12:39] base
[1:12:40] a body a neck a mouth a lip each part is
[1:12:44] important to the final plan
[1:12:45] each part is shaped exactly according to
[1:12:48] the vessel's purpose
[1:12:49] when he has finished the wheel becomes a
[1:12:51] quiet platform where the potter looks at
[1:12:53] his art
[1:12:54] he smiles you are at some stage with god
[1:12:57] as potter of your life
[1:12:59] remember paul's word we all show the
[1:13:01] lord's glory and we are being changed to
[1:13:03] be like
[1:13:04] him second corinthians 3 18.
[1:13:08] amen praise god
[1:13:12] hope you enjoyed that amen
[1:13:16] now i wanted to i wanted to take that a
[1:13:18] moment to just talk about the part where
[1:13:20] he
[1:13:20] where he starts that that the hole in
[1:13:22] the middle and you notice that that
[1:13:24] that potter he takes water and puts it
[1:13:26] in that in that hole
[1:13:28] that he creates now see there's a
[1:13:30] transition in your life from
[1:13:31] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:13:33] holy ghost
[1:13:34] amen amen you see and the baptism amen
[1:13:37] that's the actual it's a feeling amen in
[1:13:39] your life
[1:13:40] now he didn't feel the whole pot because
[1:13:43] obviously he wasn't fully formed
[1:13:45] eventually when the pot is done it will
[1:13:48] be filled it will be completely
[1:13:50] amen to the fullness amen that he
[1:13:52] envisioned before the foundation of the
[1:13:54] world
[1:13:54] but see he he just partially feels it
[1:13:58] and in in him feeling it it makes the
[1:14:00] heart open more that hole opened more
[1:14:02] so that now his whole hand can fit in
[1:14:04] there
[1:14:05] you see so it's god amen god wants to do
[1:14:08] a complete
[1:14:09] work in your life in the feeling and the
[1:14:11] baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:14:13] it's it's it's god he wants to fully
[1:14:15] take take charge of your life
[1:14:17] amen praise god so i thought that was
[1:14:19] very interesting and
[1:14:20] the rest of the video of course of
[1:14:22] course is good amen
[1:14:24] but you notice that the potter just
[1:14:26] doesn't work on the outside
[1:14:28] amen he has to work on the inside as
[1:14:31] well
[1:14:31] amen and you see sometimes we want to
[1:14:34] change our life on the outside only just
[1:14:36] we want to be
[1:14:36] sure that we're good on the outside amen
[1:14:39] but in reality
[1:14:40] the inside is full of dead man's bones
[1:14:44] it's full of nonsense and it's full of
[1:14:46] the world amen
[1:14:47] god wants to take care of that inside as
[1:14:49] a matter of fact when he works on the
[1:14:51] inside then the outside can look even
[1:14:53] more beautiful
[1:14:55] amen but when you try to do the things
[1:14:57] amen to look good on the outside only
[1:14:59] amen eventually
[1:15:01] uh that won't go too long that will fail
[1:15:04] all those things will fail you can look
[1:15:05] like a christian and you can act like
[1:15:07] one talk like one
[1:15:08] eventually you'll show who you really
[1:15:11] are
[1:15:12] you show you really are amen so the
[1:15:14] inside is just
[1:15:15] as important as the outside because wow
[1:15:18] that is where the feeling takes place
[1:15:21] amen that's where that's where the
[1:15:22] feeling takes place is everybody okay
[1:15:25] praise god amen the inside of the vessel
[1:15:29] as i said earlier it's called the heart
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:32] so the potter puts some of that water in
[1:15:34] there amen
[1:15:35] filling of the holy ghost to continue
[1:15:37] working on it from the inside look what
[1:15:39] ephesians chapter 1 says that we should
[1:15:41] be
[1:15:41] to the praise of his glory who first
[1:15:43] trusted in christ in whom you also
[1:15:45] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[1:15:48] truth
[1:15:48] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:15:51] also that ye believed you were sealed
[1:15:53] with the holy spirit of promise
[1:15:55] amen see is that water go that water
[1:15:58] going in there that allows
[1:15:59] god amen to continue molding you from
[1:16:02] the inside
[1:16:03] you see now that's not the a bunch of
[1:16:05] water it's not
[1:16:06] all of the water it's just a portion but
[1:16:08] yet it's water
[1:16:10] that is the word i hope you understand
[1:16:12] what i'm trying to get to with that amen
[1:16:14] which is verse 14 says which is the
[1:16:16] earnest of our inheritance see
[1:16:19] this the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:16:21] in your life the feeling of the holy
[1:16:23] spirit
[1:16:23] is the earnest or in other words it's
[1:16:25] the down payment
[1:16:26] of what's coming to you ahead you see
[1:16:29] yes sir
[1:16:30] it's the down payment of the purchase
[1:16:32] that he's made amen
[1:16:34] which is the earnest of iron hedge until
[1:16:36] the redemption of the purchased
[1:16:37] possession
[1:16:39] unto the praise of his glory amen
[1:16:42] so after the potter has truly worked on
[1:16:44] the inside
[1:16:45] then he can start shaping more details
[1:16:48] on the outside as you as you just saw
[1:16:50] you see as he starts fully working and
[1:16:52] you know
[1:16:53] he he had almost his whole arm in there
[1:16:54] at one point you see
[1:16:56] pulling that pressure because he's got
[1:16:58] to do the pressure from the inside
[1:17:00] not just on the outside but inside as
[1:17:02] well amen
[1:17:04] i hope in your mind you're
[1:17:05] spiritualizing all of this and hopefully
[1:17:07] you
[1:17:07] you've experienced these things in your
[1:17:09] life amen
[1:17:11] because if you're really serving god
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:14] let me tell you what saints we're
[1:17:16] heading to things amen and we're
[1:17:17] experiencing things right now where
[1:17:19] things are uncertain i believe god is
[1:17:22] molding us
[1:17:23] amen i believe god has us on that wheel
[1:17:26] amen and it's our duty amen to just have
[1:17:29] trust in him
[1:17:30] confidence that he knows what he's doing
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:34] amen so and then at the end there
[1:17:37] he starts forming what's what's called
[1:17:39] the mouth and the lip
[1:17:41] you notice there at the at the end he
[1:17:43] there was the the mouth
[1:17:44] which is the entrance of the to the
[1:17:46] water to the vessel
[1:17:47] and then the lip around it or the little
[1:17:50] lip where the where
[1:17:51] water can come out from you see and uh
[1:17:54] so after the potter has shaped and
[1:17:56] molded the vessel both inwardly and
[1:17:57] naturally he must finish with the
[1:17:59] topmost part which is called the mouth
[1:18:02] the mouth is vital it is the final part
[1:18:04] that anything inside the vessel touches
[1:18:06] when it is poured out
[1:18:08] the mouth affects and influences
[1:18:11] everything that comes out of the heart
[1:18:13] that's why jesus said a good man out of
[1:18:15] the good treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:18:17] forth that which is good amen
[1:18:20] when he has good treasure in his heart
[1:18:23] when the holy spirit is in his heart
[1:18:25] he good things will come out amen and an
[1:18:28] evil man out of the evil treasure of his
[1:18:30] heart bringeth forth that which is evil
[1:18:32] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:18:35] his mouth speaketh amen
[1:18:37] amen out of what you feed off of
[1:18:40] amen that's what you're going to speak
[1:18:42] right out of what
[1:18:44] out of out of the things that you
[1:18:47] that you watch and the things that you
[1:18:48] listen to and the things that
[1:18:50] that you feed off of spiritually that's
[1:18:53] what you're going to speak
[1:18:54] amen i don't know i mean this is all
[1:18:57] elementary to us
[1:18:59] but yet we failed we failed so many
[1:19:01] times
[1:19:03] that the basic things of christianity
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:06] amen because saints god has to get us in
[1:19:09] speaking conditions
[1:19:12] this is the hour you notice how that god
[1:19:15] is shaping the statue of a perfect man
[1:19:17] amen from the feet to the head
[1:19:22] you see and the head amen where's the
[1:19:25] mouth
[1:19:26] it's around the head the intelligence
[1:19:29] you see he's the intelligence so we got
[1:19:32] to be speaking what he says
[1:19:34] we got to get to speaking conditions
[1:19:36] amen to speak the word of god
[1:19:39] because i'm going to tell you what when
[1:19:41] you need that can of beans and it's
[1:19:43] and you don't have the can of beans
[1:19:44] laying around amen what are you going to
[1:19:46] do then
[1:19:48] you see i hope we don't have to go
[1:19:50] through things like that but
[1:19:52] there brother brown talked about a
[1:19:53] squeeze coming on the bride
[1:19:56] and we might be feeling those things
[1:19:58] already we might we started might
[1:20:00] already started feeling these things i
[1:20:01] don't think this is the squeeze that
[1:20:03] brother brown talked about
[1:20:04] no because i still see people going to
[1:20:07] the restaurants going to walmart
[1:20:08] going i'm in lowe's and building buying
[1:20:11] getting married going to school doing it
[1:20:13] everything is normal the only difference
[1:20:14] is they got a mask on
[1:20:18] that's about it and they're kind of
[1:20:20] scared of one another now
[1:20:22] but that that that's it let me tell you
[1:20:25] what something's coming down amen
[1:20:27] if you're not pressurized by the potter
[1:20:29] amen if you haven't been pressurized by
[1:20:31] his word amen
[1:20:32] if you have been pressurized in that
[1:20:33] holy spirit amen amen
[1:20:36] you might fail that test but take these
[1:20:39] times these moments that we have to come
[1:20:41] to church amen to prepare us for those
[1:20:43] times
[1:20:44] amen don't take him for granted amen
[1:20:46] sometimes the vessel gets marred
[1:20:48] amen and as we read there in jeremiah
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:52] that what happened the the vessel
[1:20:55] uh gets marred but what happened the
[1:20:57] potter all he does is brings it back
[1:21:00] down
[1:21:01] squeezes it back down but this unused
[1:21:04] doesn't use another piece of clay
[1:21:06] doesn't go out and start the process
[1:21:08] again to go out to the riverbed
[1:21:10] and and bring it forth and and and and
[1:21:13] and step
[1:21:14] on it and do everything no he just takes
[1:21:16] the same clay and starts
[1:21:17] molding it again so if you don't pass
[1:21:19] the test the first time you're gonna
[1:21:21] pass it the second time
[1:21:22] you don't pass it the second time you're
[1:21:24] gonna pass it the third time
[1:21:25] and so on forth and so forth until you
[1:21:28] pass the test
[1:21:29] until he sees amen his reflection amen
[1:21:32] just like i like what they said there
[1:21:34] that the potter sees his reflection down
[1:21:36] at the base because they're of the water
[1:21:38] that's in there amen
[1:21:39] amen amen praise god can you imagine
[1:21:42] imagine when that
[1:21:43] when that vessel's fully full of water
[1:21:46] amen that that that that that image was
[1:21:49] going to be even closer it's going to be
[1:21:50] right there amen
[1:21:51] praise god amen
[1:21:55] and sometimes that clay gets marred and
[1:21:57] some and some
[1:21:58] sometimes it gets uh uh uh
[1:22:01] some some uh uh something wrong with it
[1:22:04] but it's not the fault
[1:22:05] it's usually not the fault of the potter
[1:22:07] it's something
[1:22:08] with the clay itself and the and
[1:22:11] the potter god has to go in there and
[1:22:14] figure out what it is
[1:22:16] amen then he can reshape it again amen
[1:22:19] he has to bring you down low and to
[1:22:21] reshape you
[1:22:23] because he wants to make sure that you
[1:22:25] pass that test james chapter 1 it says
[1:22:27] my brethren verse 2 my brethren counted
[1:22:30] all joy when you fall into diverse
[1:22:31] temptations knowing this
[1:22:33] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:22:35] patience
[1:22:37] amen they're trying of your faith
[1:22:39] worketh patience
[1:22:40] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:22:43] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:22:45] wanting nothing wanting nothing amen
[1:22:49] first peter 5 says humble yourselves
[1:22:51] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:22:53] that you may that he may exalt you in
[1:22:56] due time
[1:22:57] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:22:59] careth for you
[1:23:01] so sometimes just because he he brings
[1:23:03] us back down
[1:23:05] and something amen and you're wondering
[1:23:07] lord what is it that you're doing in my
[1:23:09] life i'm back here it seems like i'm in
[1:23:11] step one again but god
[1:23:14] you just know that god amen he cares
[1:23:17] about you amen
[1:23:19] and he has total control he's not giving
[1:23:22] up on you
[1:23:23] hey we we give up on ourselves amen and
[1:23:26] you give up and you say oh
[1:23:27] you know my my children they're not
[1:23:29] coming to god amen
[1:23:31] they're still living they're still
[1:23:32] breathing that means there's still mercy
[1:23:34] for them
[1:23:35] and that means there's still hope for
[1:23:36] them amen
[1:23:38] praise god amen and finally
[1:23:41] after the potter has taken this
[1:23:44] pot and has formed this vessel into what
[1:23:47] he
[1:23:48] has envisioned amen it's still not not
[1:23:50] ready
[1:23:51] amen because above it still needs to be
[1:23:53] placed in the oven amen
[1:23:55] it still needs to be placed in the fiery
[1:23:57] furnace
[1:23:58] amen amen praise god one of the last
[1:24:02] things that we may have to face is death
[1:24:05] amen or a squeeze
[1:24:08] amen and what are you going to do then
[1:24:12] is it time to crack then is it time to
[1:24:15] give up on god then
[1:24:17] amen praise god but see god has already
[1:24:20] prepared us beforehand
[1:24:22] right in the molding on the wheel in
[1:24:25] order for us to get
[1:24:26] to get us ready for the for the for the
[1:24:28] fire amen
[1:24:30] that last trial for us is sometimes we
[1:24:32] may need to face
[1:24:33] death you see we don't we're not
[1:24:35] promised tomorrow
[1:24:37] amen we know that who conquered death
[1:24:40] and that that conqueror is in us amen if
[1:24:42] we're
[1:24:43] we're to we're to not die and man we're
[1:24:45] not going to die
[1:24:46] amen but god has a has an appointment
[1:24:50] for each and every one of us
[1:24:51] first peter chapter 4 says beloved think
[1:24:53] it not strange concerning the fiery
[1:24:55] trial which is to try you
[1:24:57] in other words don't think it's strange
[1:24:59] amen it's something to be expected amen
[1:25:02] in order to harden the vessel
[1:25:04] why do you put something through fire in
[1:25:06] order to make it hard
[1:25:07] amen as though some strange thing
[1:25:09] happened unto you
[1:25:11] but rejoice in as much as ye are
[1:25:13] partakers of christ's sufferings
[1:25:15] that when his glory shall be revealed
[1:25:18] i like that that when his glory shall be
[1:25:21] revealed ye may be glad
[1:25:22] also with exceeding joy amen
[1:25:26] and after he goes through that oven
[1:25:28] after he goes through that process
[1:25:30] of he being heated up then the potter
[1:25:32] can take it
[1:25:34] and say this is exactly the vision that
[1:25:36] i had from the beginning
[1:25:38] when i was down there in that river on
[1:25:40] that riverbed
[1:25:41] this is exactly what i was imagining and
[1:25:44] the vision that god has for you amen is
[1:25:46] the vision that he had before before the
[1:25:48] foundation of the world
[1:25:50] praise god brother branham says here i'm
[1:25:52] moving a little quickly that says now
[1:25:53] look
[1:25:54] now remember there'll be an
[1:25:55] impersonation of that because it
[1:25:58] i'm sorry now remember there'll never be
[1:26:00] an impersonation of that he's speaking
[1:26:02] of the third pool
[1:26:03] because it can't be see it cannot be now
[1:26:07] it's in existence and i have i am warned
[1:26:10] of this that soon right at this time now
[1:26:12] it's just happened so it could identify
[1:26:14] its presence
[1:26:15] among you see but it will not be used in
[1:26:17] a great way until the council
[1:26:19] begins to tighten up and when it does
[1:26:22] when that does the pentecostals and so
[1:26:24] forth can be can almost impersonate
[1:26:26] anything can be done but when that time
[1:26:29] comes when the squeeze comes down then
[1:26:31] you'll see
[1:26:32] what you've seen temporarily be
[1:26:34] manifested in the fullness of its
[1:26:36] power amen amen
[1:26:39] what you've seen temporarily what we've
[1:26:42] we've all seen great things happening in
[1:26:44] our lives
[1:26:45] i mean there's been great miracles that
[1:26:47] have taken place even in this
[1:26:48] in this church i believe even brother
[1:26:50] dale's is a great miracle amen every
[1:26:53] healing that takes place amen is a
[1:26:54] miracle from god
[1:26:56] man god healed you from a cold that's a
[1:26:58] miracle amen god healed your your your
[1:27:01] toothache amen that's a miracle
[1:27:03] amen god god your nail grew back out
[1:27:06] that's a miracle
[1:27:08] because that all that all that is cells
[1:27:10] and all life comes from god
[1:27:13] so it's a miracle we've seen great
[1:27:14] things happen in in
[1:27:16] in our lives amen but what a greater
[1:27:18] thing amen
[1:27:20] we're going to see greater things but at
[1:27:23] some at a point in time
[1:27:24] at a junction of time amen but there has
[1:27:26] to be a squeeze to
[1:27:27] squeeze us down amen in order for
[1:27:30] everything that god has placed in us to
[1:27:32] be fully
[1:27:33] fully uh fully displayed amen amen
[1:27:37] and it's when we come out of the oven
[1:27:38] it's at this point that we are
[1:27:40] transformed into the image that the
[1:27:41] potter had of us from the beginning
[1:27:43] right in first corinthians 15 it says
[1:27:45] but we shall all be
[1:27:47] changed amen in a moment in the
[1:27:50] twinkling of an eye amen this corruption
[1:27:52] must take on incorruption
[1:27:54] amen and this mortal must take on
[1:27:56] immortality
[1:27:57] and it's at this point that your vessel
[1:28:00] is completely
[1:28:01] filled for good both and inside and
[1:28:03] outside
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:08] i like something that brother dale said
[1:28:10] a long time ago and i i believe it
[1:28:13] he said that it's at that point amen
[1:28:15] that you will be able to fully say that
[1:28:17] you're born again
[1:28:19] amen see right now we say you're born
[1:28:22] again but
[1:28:23] you know again remember we have the holy
[1:28:26] spirit amen partially
[1:28:29] amen we have the the the down payment of
[1:28:32] it
[1:28:32] amen but it's at that point when you
[1:28:35] fully come amen through that process
[1:28:37] of fully amen you've conquered death
[1:28:40] hell and the grave
[1:28:42] amen you come out on the other side amen
[1:28:44] exactly
[1:28:45] what he envisioned of you before the
[1:28:47] foundation of the world that full
[1:28:49] eden condition amen and even
[1:28:52] even in a greater way because adam
[1:28:55] didn't even have eternal life in his
[1:28:56] flesh
[1:28:57] you'd have eternal life in your flesh
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:01] eternal life not just in your soul but
[1:29:02] in your flesh manifested on the outside
[1:29:05] that is the full new birth process ava
[1:29:07] you know what that's when we actually
[1:29:09] begin to live amen that's when we
[1:29:12] actually begin to live
[1:29:14] and i believe we will be learning even
[1:29:16] more of god at that point
[1:29:19] amen don't think that that when we get
[1:29:21] to that point that that's it that's all
[1:29:22] of god we need to know no
[1:29:24] i believe god is going to be revealing
[1:29:26] himself even more
[1:29:28] at that point amen oh man we can't put
[1:29:31] no limit on god
[1:29:32] amen so you want to get on the potter's
[1:29:34] wheel
[1:29:36] amen that that but then you
[1:29:39] we want to make sure that we want to be
[1:29:41] in his will then
[1:29:43] and ready to receive amen whatever comes
[1:29:46] our way
[1:29:47] amen and don't think it's strange if it
[1:29:50] comes and just say lord
[1:29:54] stop say lord you're doing something in
[1:29:56] my life
[1:29:57] amen and i believe god is doing
[1:30:00] something in our lives
[1:30:01] let's stand to our feet we're gonna have
[1:30:03] the musicians come
[1:30:04] sister esther i think i think sister
