========================================

so we will begin to have our brothers in exercise some of that five fold we've been talking about that's right so that's five fold ministry and we are rough huh I don't have my pad yet but I'll have my up and I'm getting a lot of it so brother Anderson brother Anderson he when he gave it to me he and I remember and you go in and help because last gonna go buy another mean John was gonna go trying to take it out before I have it fixed and you said something about he usually maybe you all continue to be you should be got an apple cap last part of my memory and I remember Anderson said I got Apple care on the thing when I bought it for so having Apple Care course just been a fiasco trying to get them to get to the people but I'm but hey I'm getting a free iPad so there's Antonia you know we'll get back started on that but first my animals will say when I called him he said I know you drop it no I don't know this thing's it's covered till December of nineteen so I've got it so you're good oh man I'm just not gonna get another rum what the problem was to let someone come in what the problem I remember that day I opened it up with a bottom part with the keypad if you ever get one it's neat to have one with the magnet but if nothing ever detaches it did what it did that day fell off so I'm gonna get a whole nother kinda like what Jim's got there that's solid the way when you open it up and it stays together and it was funny it was neat to have the magnet because you could take it out on the leg down and do your you know on the plane and put it back together but it didn't work that nice so won't get another room I'm gonna get one of those otter defenders where you can throw into Lane not want any of that going on for bridge all right let's go we're going to go to Romans chapter 4 we're going to go into Bible again because we don't have our screen up but we've been in Romans 4 talking about circumcision on circumcision now but what we're doing is is we're looking at now Roman 4 we read last week talking about what Paul is looking back to Abraham yes sir look cut will it connect and you got the Bible on there if you want to yell let's not do it this way yeah it's okay I don't want I don't want I want to flow through this but thank you I appreciate that I love all these brothers trying to help a man and they do a lot of work yes no that ain't no down they know that I'm that won't hit all the time so justification though remember when we talk about justification in the seals justification is not what you do and don't do it's all hi grace migration we saved through faith through faith that's my name now that's what Paul's talking about Romans remember he's getting ready to go to Rome so he's gonna have to deal with the heathen Romans and he's got the deal and also the Christian Romans and he's telling them sit luck to be physically circumcised or physically on a certain size means nothing to die at this point now before and Old Testament it was a sign but it wasn't it wasn't a sign it wasn't a sign that everything was fine because a lot of people were certain style murders long these little circumcised David will circumcise a man he was a physical circumcised did but he was a murderer an adulterer a liar right so that certain things it didn't matter need for every covers David just a little one than what even verse six even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man who died in few rights and this network david ought to know that david oughta know that there was righteousness in feuding without works because under david works he was david under David's work he should have been killed tell me mother murder and a adulterer but remember God knew his heart that's why I when we get into the fifth seal we're gonna see something that's this really fantastic about the grace of God giving eternal life to a group of people that did not want the fifth seal cube rejected Christ but in rejecting Christ Christ got a Gentile bride and that's what he was looking for to start with say listen God didn't have to change his plan he knew that Israel would go whoring he knew that Israel would would go after other men other mates adult idolatry turns into adultery okay and it does because when you idolize a woman or a man then then you can commit adultery wasn't really easy when you I wanted that person alright so natural types of spiritually so in the Old Testament he knew his rule was gonna go after but Bale and all those other Moloch coming they got well they were sacrificing their own kids to this to this God you know put them in the fire the Bible even talks about you know putting through the father their children so they must have believed in this God pretty day but so they rejected him but God knew that a Gentile ground that's what the Jews are staunch I know that the Jews are they have their place but the Jews have to have signs and wonders the Jews have that's why when Moses then allowed to go over to Israel sure they're going to preach the word but they're going to be able to call anything they want to and those 144,000 are going to see that they're going to respond to it right where a Gentile just does like the Centurion whatever you say Lord you don't have to come to my house but in Nigeria the Jew coming in lay hands oh my oh my child you don't come in no you don't need that yes so that's what God wanted because remember Abraham got it by faith Abraham got it by faith and then what he done was he believed what God told me and a sign of circumcision came into view I have to really believe an unknown voice telling me to circumcise myself in your goal right yeah us guys know what we're talking about and he did it himself he didn't get knocked out with novocaine and some doctors know the volatility did it itself so you see what I mean even a natural act of that of that kind of took faith first right we'll see it was revealed that a man it was revealed that Abraham that he was going to have that child but now remember it was it but it was withholding because remember you can get a revelation and then there's a revelation behind that revelation brother i'm cinda is a revelation about a supernatural element despite the revelation will Abraham supernatural revelation he didn't get wasn't even don't have it by Sarah that was a supernatural revelation if he would have known he's gonna have a my Sarah to begin with you starting with Sarah but Israel but his revelation was he's gonna have a child well there's Hagar I can still do what I'm doing she can still deal with she's young girl so let me help you God will see that time it won't end that was no guide to all no help anyone he was gonna have it through Sarah but you know what he still went Abraham do what he did because remember when you go down to the end of the road I bet you Abraham that's not report in a Bible but Abraham being a human man he said man I messed up when he mail Melchizedek and he finally says you're gonna have that child by Sarah in the time of life the next 28 days the next cycle you're gonna have fuel and even having cycles at the time the God was just telling him in 28 days y'all gonna turn back into a young person and y'all gonna have a baby we'll see if I that time Abraham said stupid name if you know me really like I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean that I didn't mean them to fall down on my face and laugh and I didn't mean to try to give my life away yet he didn't give after even after the change trying to give it away and that just shows them the frailness of our human nature without the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the Holy Ghost he would have never done that and then so but there had to be that tight because God saw a Gentile right right so he's had to physically physically blind the eyes of the Jews put his hand right over their eyes and say you can't see me until I take the Gentile bride and then I'll erase your iniquity with 144,000 and I'll put your tribes back in order I'm going to send you two prophets and then you're going to be not Brad anymore but you're going to be service to the bride you're going to be in the temple you're gonna be in this they'll be the only ones in the city all right besides the bride the bride of nine 44,000 all of them will be in that city okay the rest have to come in and go out and come in and go I know I meet brother clock we're talking about something the other day and I kind of like his analogy I mean it's not it's biblical but there's no clothes or anything but the Bible says it came to brain one their brain quite in other words you didn't say timing but they'll bring the stuff into the city and leave with a leaf came to the earth what are they coming in for pay their time we will live up the tide of the plan from the people on the outside just like to leave us were supposed to have food just like down with tonight the other day the Levitical priesthood was never supposed to be a trial ever it was it was set apart remember he give all these other people something and then Levi said well what the Lord said found your portion right why because these twelve tribes paid a tenth to the Levi and they lived off of that dude right so what will happen this will be the new city will be the Levitical priests to the highest order right you got 12 tribes our nation's because brother Brown said they would be politics outside because it's a king they okay so it's gonna be different out there than it is in the city in the city it's going to be us and 34,000 and we got one King King Jesus but they will bribe them the Bible says the kings of the earth will come in to bring their timely well what if they didn't raise the beans and potatoes in the characters we don't have to eat but you know what I'd like to eat I still don't like to eat and they bring those timing in and give it to us and all the people wouldn't stick only one photo so I think it he just really think continuity with what the Bible tell us as the Levitical priesthood lived off of they go Kyle enough people but over him the faith of Abraham folk we got a couple about now but remember we cut down to about verse 16 let's go back up to 13 because Paul's trying to describe something there watch for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or his seed to the law in other words to his loins never there's God to have a kingdom set up by sexual activity just put it that way right no it's by like I saw the womb of our mind God comes into the womb of our mind plants to see work of God and that's the way we were supposed to grow that we were supposed to come in the garden we're supposed to come by natural after that all right so that's what we're doing now we're coming exactly the way we were supposed to all right it's by the seed word of doctor blood it was a mate to them to pay for him or his seed bring to the wall the law was man and woman gets together they have children now listen that's contrary to God because you're going to see in just a minute that says in verse 14 of chapter 5 says never let death reigned from Adam to Moses okay that's when we had to have a second Adam born under the law but to bring us out from under the law everybody all right with that it says but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made boy in other words means you know child named Josh Josh gets tired inheritance that ain't faith that's fit the path that's not faith but the faith is isn't that a canard to get something from me not being that air physical though being a spiritual heir she can get something from me now that's them not the less when all is we we glean our our inheritance comes through the fivefold ministry I say dream not from through the five whole minutes not from the five oh man and over that don't make us God we have no inheritance hey sailor preaching the gospel to you and then what we're taught as you go ahead pursuit of Christ not to ministry but when Christ comes through the ministry then he distributes be distribute all of our inheritance through the ministry okay that's why we have an inheritance incorruptible all these other inherits that you get it can be billions of dollars one day I mean some else are talking not too long ago you know somebody said well he's got deep pockets I said yeah but it doesn't have a bottom in it might be real deep but you know what little bottom in that party around there so there's some money there's a there's a there's a end of the pocket but with God it's eternity so I mean you just keep getting and getting getting again okay that's why we have an inheritance eternal in the heavens the Bible says what heavenly place it for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made boy Abraham given additional give it a listen that that's just you don't have to have faith you know if mom and dad passed away I wouldn't have to have faith I just go read the will go down a part of their lineage all right so look cut buddy righteous that the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made them not affect because they'll all work at the raft we see that for where no law is there is no transgression so they'll all had to come therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace what grace not anything you did to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed and I told you I circled back and put Genesis 1:26 go he's not come back natural seed it's done by spiritual seed that let us make man in our own image and after our likeness that never came through the loins of a man or a woman natural it came from God Almighty spoken work okay they might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is the little law but to that also witches of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all now he's not the father nervous sitting in this room that I know of physically but spiritually he's our Father why because we have faith we have to believe I have to believe I'm in there okay but I know when I read the widow and says no matters and joint heirs with Christ and if I have Christ living in me and I become part of the kingdom or part of the family I get my inheritance I don't have to tell face for that makes a lot of things you don't have to have faithful holy I faith for a rapture no have faith for up resurrection the rapture will take place because of that man you know this I'll see you in the rapture things okay but I want to see the devoman this once and dance among us what's the dance among us the rapture will take place but until the Dead come up until there's a resurrection message preached no one will come up with people emigrate see that's our inheritance our inheritance it's not going to the graveyard and put them in the grave I don't Hera pictures what eternal life to make this body eternal verse 17 know what's he's interpolated now watch him he's going to interpolate here cut it the father of us all as it is written now let's go back if you look in your scope in the Bible if you don't go back justice 17:5 God said I have made thee a father of many nations now right there at that point in time he didn't have him he didn't how child warned by promise in other words how they went was coming but he went there yet before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which are not as though they were who against hope believed in hope everything was against Abraham having the child everything physical was against Abraham having child all right physically he could not produce but he believed in what God said see that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and I wrote my Bible us that is not now Abraham's natural lineage that's his spiritual lineage alright and being not weak and faint no wait a minute father wait a minute Paul be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not now if we go read the commentary he did stay if we read the law he staggered but you bring the law over through Christ and bringing through the blood and watch what Paul said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and look here and being fully persuaded and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform because God had to perform first yeah change his body a man before able help to bring though the natural part the promise into effect and therefore T was imputed to him for righteousness in other words our faith can weigh a long time dormant Abraham's faith laid a long time dormant went through ups and downs and ins and outs and bad days and good day but still you've got to see what he's there being fully persuaded therefore it was imputed to him for Isis what do you gotta do doctor okay Abraham I know you're the only person on this earth is gonna listen to me - it's full those who endure to the end I think we're in don't listen those who endure to the end shall be safe Abraham endured God you ain't listened to me God knew Abraham would be the only person on the earth that would endure what he endured and have that child if not he's here to pick somebody else so I said about brother Branham if they be by helpful to fit that mold for the church age messenger it would have been them but it was william my friend he fit the mold so I said all right here it is so we gave him the gift because you know why do you can handle it God will not give you a gift that you can't handle they even press yourself anything but at the end can consider the end of the conversation he just Christ the same yesterday and therefore it was imputed to him for actions no one does that word imputing are reckoned in other words God knew he would make it to the end did what God said and have a child now that same way with you and I you know I don't know that we go through the ups and downs and ins and outs and all this other stuff but those who endure to the end shall be safe now it was not written for his sake alone that was imputed to him all of what he's saying but for us also now watch gives that big old word with a huge meaning but for us also to whom that it shall be imputed yeah you know every time in the Bible pretty much that I Circle that word because that word is yeah that means you have a free moral Andersen yes yes this charts the time we're not gonna be absolved yes then we have similes in little bitty words are so profound if we believe on him that raised up Jesus I was working that night and said we believe everything no it's a few believing that Graham he's bringing in arrived to today but for us also to him it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again I serve them didn't put in the end time come back for us the first resurrection was fine that gave us eternal life the second resurrection of the Son of Man in the end time was gonna change our body amen my man people don't get excited about that anymore I get excited about my team this is get over he was raised again for what our justification those who he's justified he's already 45 Paul's telling you around here this is where he's getting it all from those who he's justified he's already fortified all right so look now let's a little bit of a chapter stop therefore being justified by faith not by works how in the world can we justify ourselves we cannot we have to depend on God's justification therefore then the Bible says the justifier and the justified is the same because if I'm justified by Christ it's him not me but I'm an heir of that so I get what do you get so I just I like we're brother any single time I I have attached myself to the eternal that's why I have attached myself to the eternal so I like that therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ look by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us more for when we were yet without strength remember the law had no strength said just to condemn me and that's all and no strength to get you out from under well when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly yes actually I like what I like what Scofield says down here the man he says death is universal oh God send us infants moral people religious people equally with the DES frame so Navajo lies where he's been come back in Adam all died what because of the Train Christian of Adam we all died well the one the second come took away of transgression when he said it Spanish nothing you just gotta believe it's been a man but scarcely look we're scarcely for a righteous man will one die no words I've given my life for Aaron but if it's something he does that's his home ICMP you see what I'm saying yes that's human beings would say okay I'll give my life for brother Louise I'll knock him out a little later but now if you've done something last week don't look like them I with condition constant get on the cross and say well if they'll believe me no he died without condition he gave us life without condition no although one condition if you believe in me I'll give you eternal life that's that's only condition there is because for scarcely for a righteous man will one died yet pre adventure for a good man some would even dare to die okay for a good man you would but now what the problem is they just put you in the grave insane he was a good soldier he gave this you know we'll give him the Purple Heart well that means nothing to assault you know they could be a good man pushing me out of the way get run over and kill but if you went morning in now you might be given eternal life for being good at two but in other words it's not his salvation right and that soul of that man can't come back and make me any better but now when Christ died when he pushed us out of the way and took the cross he said I'm dying for your good so when he died he come back to make you better that's why there's only one man could have died that was Jesus Christ he was old man to die give his life and give it freely he John the man can take the soul and imparted back to us that's the whole thing because we have a soul of God if you're born again that's all it was I know in you today good morning meeting another man couldn't do that no other man on earth could do that only God himself but scarcely for a righteous man will one die that's why you see that listen that's why do you see that doctrine we keep harping on the people say Jesus wasn't on River Jordan well the second part of that doctrine is is that when he went to the cross when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane the Holy Ghost came up out of him he's not a man now buddy I'm telling you danger salvation in that that does away with a whole plan of salvation because whoever went and died up there if it was just a regular spiritual man he's laying someone grave dead and his spirit still the her soul till that time but I depend on that being the soul of God because he's the only one can divide he don't what it can divide to give us eternal life so I heat when he was on that cross I was with him and then eternal life them doing that cross when the body couldn't handle the spirit the soul anymore it left the body that and that made the body die that's just when it's just real sin but God commended look God commended commendeth his love and I wrote Jesus in my Bible because God's love is Jesus Christ right but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than now underline that much more than they saying okay that was good but much more much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him no judgment I'm telling you the Bible in that when I read the Bible I see that we don't have it on over brother I'm doubtful you don't have to go through judgment but now every other denomination in the world says they have to go through some kind of tribulation some kind of white throne judgment do not do not do not not as a bride all right no one could watch for it for you when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled in other words accepting what he we shall be saved by his wife amen and not only so not a little paulie's not finished and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement now there was your tone with the shedding of the blood that's the atonement and we perceived that not naturally you pour gallons of blood on you'd still be up soon right but by that blood sacrifice not the blood but the life it within the blood all right let me read a few more this right here look so really in that chapter 5 right there up to verse 11 God is the heart of brother brother Paul God is telling us through brother Paul that were justified by faith we're justified by what Christ did on the cross we just have to attach ourselves to that and then accept what do you know where as by will in verse 12 man sin entered into the world I do with that all right by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so that death passed upon all men for all for that all have sinned I like to put it in there you know and I know up listen we are special group of people just like I told you links tonight there's there's no link in the way from we were especially group of people but we had to come through a cleansing process before we became that kind of person right because we all see it right here I just like to leave it at that we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Paul said all right now look he's interpolating know watch what's calling him this is his this one he answered pilate's were about who were the entry points were six scriptures he's trying to really explain this so let's read this real quick the only twenty after for good alright work war has gone one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so what it's saying I believe it's not drinking smoking gambling all that stuff right sending them away right so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned and that's the one where Co feel it's send us in puts more people religious people equally with the depraved for a universal effect there must be a universal cause so death reigned from Adam but weights less thing now watch these interpolated I'll have since stopped right thing no Oh Paul's gonna blame he gonna spring what's going on all right before until the law sin within the world but Stan was not imputed but there's no law there's no there's no sin sin is do's and don'ts amazing is it really the bottom line it is when I watch nevertheless Paul nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses what because when Moses came into being to lock him into being okay right who is to think one sorry nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the symbol to dove Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come that who is that Jesus Christ the figure of him to come Jesus Christ is going to take away that transgression that Adam did alright but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead Adams problem is it's like I said before Adam went out with even and and took her sin upon him but the problem with Adam was out of what capital G OD he was a lesser God but his soul couldn't come back into Eve the saver are two Sam Arta Abel are takane he couldn't did that because well cuz I don't tell my uncle out I'll take em okay Carson you might be God but you're not that God call down to God that's coming I can divide my soul you can't man that's just the way I see it you know you eat Adam got out programs I haven't got out you couldn't get my hand what god gold mouthguard okay good he couldn't save nobody it's mine you can't see these doctrines of Adam state up Adam I haven't been came couldn't save yourself it's over there he couldn't say thee sure you protected her just like Christ protected the bride while we were in Santa Christ protected us mm-hm but not as the offence them every dish mundo so also is the free kill for a friendly offense of one many be dead Adam much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto me you put me and they don't you play mini-me and not as it was by one that sins so is together what for the judgment was by one to condemnation member Adam was condemned in his flesh to now died his soul did not his body died so they're one of my condemnation but the free gift is as of many offenses unto justification for EF Bella for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness your reign in life by one Jesus Christ now there's there's the other preface eight he took him that whole time now now watch now let's go back this is what Paul was explaining what he sent us go back to verse verse 12 because he begins interpolating verse 13 14 15 16 17 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned go over to verse 18 therefore see if we would have just explained when to write down except by the airport no he explained the whole process there between the intra planning and within the parentheses and forth verses he explained what he's come back to an Isis therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation knew was that Adam even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification as loud by one who Jesus Christ even only righteous one okay all right let's recap whoof in if we get down to six I think quick for about asked by one man's disobedience that was the whole thing he was disobedient many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous Jesus Christ moreover the law entered that the offense might abound the law enter so the things would be a judgment but where sin abounded grace did I underline this twice and grace did much more allowed because grace was first a man that as sin have reigned unto death even so my grace ran through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord now watch let's read verse 1 because remember chapter 6 it's not chapter 6 when I'm doing writing right man put that break in there alright what have we just been talking about what are you just saying I watch what shall we say then what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound verse 2 not forbid how shall we that are dead to sin living the longer there and now this is the baptismal scripture so we'll cover it next Sunday we read this at the baptismal scripture chapter stick to verse 11 we read this for the baptism because that's what he's talking about death has no more dominion over me you and I when we go into that deadly into that water dad dad what dad just put me in there death burial resurrection all right that's why I always say we don't do a baptism what we go into a killing but we also want a resurrection man so let's go throwing a stick Nick chapter 3 [Music]
