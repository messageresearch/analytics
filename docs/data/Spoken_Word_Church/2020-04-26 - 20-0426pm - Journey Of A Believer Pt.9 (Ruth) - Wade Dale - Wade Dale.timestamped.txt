[0:00] to see you open the eyes of my heart
[0:07] Lord open the eyes of my
[0:15] want to see you yes I want to see you to
[0:24] see you high and lifted up shining in
[0:32] the light of your lorry pour out your
[0:38] power in love as we sing holy holy holy
[0:44] [Applause]
[0:46] hi let's head up shining in the light of
[0:54] your glory pour out your power and love
[1:00] as we say holy holy holy a manly loving
[1:07] today holy holy holy
[1:16] holy holy holy
[1:19] holy holy holy
[1:24] I want to see you and we used to say
[1:30] turn around shake somebody's hand saying
[1:32] god bless you so let's just say God
[1:34] bless you God bless you God bless you
[1:35] God bless you no sneezing now god bless
[1:38] you god bless you god bless all you out
[1:41] there in the in the parking lot it was
[1:43] full this morning
[1:47] that's good we need to stay on the road
[1:49] routine remember we're sheep we have to
[1:51] be led we have to do we have to do due
[1:56] diligence we don't want the devil he's
[1:58] getting enough place now let's don't
[2:00] give him a let's don't give him a full
[2:02] place let's cut him off at the pass good
[2:07] to be in the house of Lord oh let's see
[2:12] the only announcement I have is is now
[2:15] according to the state of Georgia
[2:18] starting I think Tuesday or somewhere in
[2:20] there we're going to be able to meet
[2:22] some more than usual well I just think
[2:27] now we need to kind of stay with all the
[2:29] men just I make an announcement now that
[2:32] all the men can come on Sunday and
[2:36] Wednesday if you want to and then we'll
[2:38] work in - week by week we'll work in to
[2:41] see if and I hate it but but I just feel
[2:46] that's the way we ought to do it I've
[2:47] been thinking about it all week and bill
[2:49] Adele's same way we just need to be
[2:52] diligent I notice the prayer cloth over
[2:55] all the doors and that's good we believe
[2:59] that we just want to make sure that
[3:01] we're doing the right thing and don't
[3:03] cause any concern I don't want anybody
[3:06] to get this thing and now we know people
[3:09] that do have it and Gainesville's become
[3:11] a hot spot because of people not social
[3:14] distancing and all that all that other
[3:15] stuff I we were talking about this the
[3:17] other day you know I
[3:19] they were condemning President Trump for
[3:22] some of the things he said but you know
[3:24] this virus
[3:26] he's killed by soapy water
[3:30] it doesn't take this great big washdown
[3:33] of radiation you know radiation
[3:38] chemicals they wash your hands and and
[3:42] then now they're telling us that UV
[3:44] light and sunlight kills it in less than
[3:46] a minute so the reason I'm saying this
[3:49] is if we if we decide to start bringing
[3:52] this thing back according to what I see
[3:54] on the on the news and the and watching
[3:58] the real not news but watching what the
[4:04] officials are saying or health officials
[4:06] that you might want to wear a mask if
[4:09] you want to but if you have that mask
[4:11] and you want to get rid of the virus lay
[4:14] it out in the sunshine just within a few
[4:16] minutes it'll kill the virus on the
[4:18] theme but but remember be careful when
[4:22] y'all are putting these masks on because
[4:24] your hands that's why they're telling
[4:27] people now that if you're sick wear the
[4:29] mask so that you don't make somebody
[4:31] else sick okay don't wear the mask to
[4:34] keep from getting sick because you can
[4:36] lay the thing down here somebody could
[4:38] walk by and go to and then here you go
[4:41] and put the thing on and you got it so
[4:43] the best thing to do is if you're sick
[4:45] don't come but if you do have the
[4:49] sneezing and the sniffles and the coughs
[4:50] or whatever you probably need to wear a
[4:52] mask to protect me not to protect you
[4:54] but to protect me and that way we can we
[4:58] can get rid of this things it like
[5:00] brother Dale said it's attacking bodies
[5:02] and it's attacking the sick a lot of the
[5:08] sick people and and we know how it's
[5:10] affecting the minority population and we
[5:16] hate that we're just going to keep
[5:19] praying that God will stay this thing
[5:21] and it'll be over
[5:23] it ain't gonna all be over but it'll be
[5:26] over as much as we so we can get back to
[5:28] church so that we can get back to and I
[5:32] told junior the day I said I don't
[5:35] believe I ever touched my face until
[5:36] they told us not to touch your face my
[5:39] nose itch the hope Danny I'll be out
[5:41] there delivering mail and my no
[5:44] be like feathers all over my nose you
[5:46] know yeah so anyway but the Lord blessed
[5:50] you do the due diligence you know even
[5:55] if we washed our hands more and if we
[5:57] hand sanitizers and if we did this more
[6:00] often we wouldn't get a common cold
[6:02] called the common cold is the fact in
[6:04] the same way it passes from person to
[6:06] person so let's turn in our Bibles to
[6:07] the book of 1st Corinthians verse 10
[6:11] we're going to continue on the journey
[6:12] of a believer this is part 9 but we're
[6:16] gonna talk about the Book of Ruth so if
[6:18] you got your Bibles you want to stay
[6:19] there if not brother Henderson's gonna
[6:21] have it we're going to go like we did in
[6:24] Genesis probably verse by verse if we
[6:28] get finished we do if we don't see there
[6:30] I go touching my face again there huh so
[6:33] anyway hand sanitizer
[6:36] we're going to go 2 corinthians but
[6:38] we're going to talk about the book of
[6:40] roots because to me the book of ruth and
[6:42] you'll see what brother Branham says
[6:43] about this I found this quote that that
[6:47] you really enjoy because the Book of
[6:50] Ruth is really not about it's kind of
[6:53] like the book of Esther there's really
[6:54] not a lot to do with God and and
[6:58] Redemption and all but it's all full of
[7:00] it brother Branham said this is one of
[7:03] the greatest chapter greatest chapters
[7:06] or books in the Old Testament that talks
[7:09] about Christ the church and all the
[7:11] different settings as the same way as
[7:17] the great story of Esther so you got
[7:21] Ruth and Esther in the Bible doesn't
[7:23] mention God a whole lot in the Book of
[7:25] Ruth but it tells the whole plan of
[7:26] redemption to me and it gives all the
[7:29] four journeys as we were talking about
[7:31] the other day sitting outside
[7:34] we know it's Christians I want you to
[7:36] get this in your mind we know it's
[7:37] Christians that it's justification
[7:39] sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost
[7:40] makes you a born-again believer alright
[7:44] but then in the end time and as brother
[7:48] Dale's been talking about the son of man
[7:49] there is something extra that we get
[7:53] because we'll look at it in just a
[7:55] minute that the
[7:56] or combat be sly knocks man Inigo so it
[7:58] takes four stages to bring us back to
[8:01] full Redemption and then Lord willing if
[8:04] I do finish this this Sunday next Sunday
[8:07] we want to go back in the Old Testament
[8:09] and talk about Reuben and GAD and 1/2
[8:12] tribe of Manasses because then that
[8:14] shows the book of shows the whole plan
[8:16] of redemption for us and showing what
[8:20] they got because some went over the end
[8:23] of the possess the land and some did not
[8:25] but they still went over and fought and
[8:27] come back so so it's really a beautiful
[8:29] type so let's go to 1st Corinthians I
[8:31] want to read this first and then we'll
[8:34] go into the Book of Ruth let's bow our
[8:37] heads family father Lord today we pray
[8:42] that number one that you'll save the
[8:46] lost souls so that's the most important
[8:48] thing this wall down below my feet is
[8:51] full of names of of loved ones and
[8:54] friends and family and husbands and
[8:56] wives and children of people that are
[9:00] not in the fold and we pray Lord that
[9:04] you would do a supernatural soul healing
[9:08] first and then we asked Lord those that
[9:11] have already went across into the
[9:13] promised land Lord that you'd give us
[9:15] rest in these bodies that you take all
[9:17] the sickness away and keep all the
[9:19] sickness away that you would bless Lord
[9:21] this congregation in the inside and on
[9:24] the outside and ones that are watching
[9:26] in the little bride around the world
[9:28] Lord we've come to a place to where we
[9:30] all now at one time within the last two
[9:33] months it has affected every person on
[9:37] the face of this earth in some way or
[9:39] the other so it has affected the bride
[9:41] so but it's brother Dale says this we're
[9:44] built for this we're astronauts we're
[9:46] built for this pressure we're built for
[9:48] this time and we've come to a place to
[9:51] where we need to learn more about you
[9:52] father the days are getting shorter and
[9:54] we pray that you just bless now give us
[9:57] supernatural revelation give us
[9:59] supernatural healing and Lord bless us
[10:02] as we go about our jobs Lord that we all
[10:05] do what we need to do and then as they
[10:07] open this thing back up
[10:09] Lord that you will just stay this plague
[10:11] father that you'll take Lord as we did
[10:15] in there in the book of Genesis and all
[10:18] the different places and Exodus and the
[10:21] different things that as plagues would
[10:23] come Moses and Aaron would stand and run
[10:26] through the crowd with a censor the Lord
[10:29] we have the Word of God we have the
[10:32] written word of God the censor of the
[10:35] day that we can send out among the
[10:36] people and Lord that they'll stay this
[10:39] thing and help us Lord all of humanity
[10:42] not just the bride Lord we know you're
[10:43] gonna take care of the bride but we pray
[10:45] for just people that are dying left and
[10:47] right Lord that don't know you father we
[10:49] pray for those people in those families
[10:51] the ones are in the hospital ones that
[10:52] are sick ones on brothers that Scotch
[10:55] prayer list and especially touch brother
[10:57] Dutch their father's still still trying
[11:03] to recover from those tick bites Lord we
[11:04] pray that you just be with him father
[11:06] give us our daily bread today and make
[11:08] us strong and healthy in Jesus name we
[11:09] pray amen
[11:11] this journey of believer part 9 this is
[11:13] Ruth's first Corinthians 10 verse 1 says
[11:15] moreover brethren now this is who this
[11:17] is Paul talking to the Corinthians I
[11:20] would not that you should be ignorant
[11:21] now that all our fathers were under the
[11:23] cloud and all passed through the sea now
[11:25] that one thing for sure Paul knew that
[11:28] Old Testament up one side and down the
[11:32] other he knew every movement I mean he
[11:34] was right there knew the Scrolls back
[11:37] and forward so he knew what went on but
[11:40] now what he's trying to do is take that
[11:41] group of people and bring the examples
[11:45] to him or to us as Christians because
[11:47] look and we're all baptized unto Moses
[11:50] in the cloud and in the sea and did all
[11:53] eat the same spiritual meat and I
[11:54] remember this looks great but watch what
[12:00] he's saying and did all drink the same
[12:02] spiritual drink for they drank of that
[12:06] spiritual words every person drink of
[12:08] those miracles every person was affected
[12:12] by those miracles but with many of them
[12:16] verse 5 God was not well pleased for
[12:19] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[12:20] they all died except for two
[12:24] now these things were our example to the
[12:28] intent we should not lust after evil
[12:30] things as they also lusted need to be
[12:33] idolaters as were some of them as it is
[12:35] written the people sat down to eat and
[12:37] drink and rose up to play neither let us
[12:39] commit fornication as some of them
[12:40] committed and fell in one day 23
[12:43] thousand people because the fornication
[12:46] died neither let us tempt Christ as some
[12:49] of them also tempted them were destroyed
[12:51] of serpents remember they said they
[12:52] didn't want to eat the man anymore so
[12:54] God sent them quail in any also centum
[12:56] serpents neither murmur ye as some of
[12:59] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[13:01] the destroyer now here's my point now
[13:03] all these things what we've been talking
[13:06] about of Abraham what we're getting
[13:07] ready to talk about Ruth and all these
[13:09] different movements in the Old Testament
[13:10] now all these things happened unto them
[13:13] for example and they are written for our
[13:16] admonition who upon who us our
[13:21] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[13:23] world are come and so it's talking
[13:26] directly to me and you this is the end
[13:27] of the world we see the end of the world
[13:30] coming so all these things are for our
[13:32] admonition you may be seated in the Lord
[13:33] as blessing the reading the world
[13:35] reading of the word if you want to turn
[13:37] to the Book of Ruth you can or we're
[13:39] gonna read it from here but let's go
[13:40] down first because we're gonna try to
[13:44] parallel this oh my y'all put y'all put
[13:48] lines on there thank you these guys were
[13:51] good so now let's before before we begin
[13:55] let's get our mind set on this as being
[13:57] a Sunday School lesson are a little bit
[13:59] of teaching here the journey of Abraham
[14:02] we've already been through the journey
[14:03] of Abraham we went through justification
[14:05] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[14:07] and I put in the new birth because
[14:09] remember you can have the Holy Ghost on
[14:10] your flesh on your spirit and every day
[14:12] of your life and don't go to hell I'm
[14:13] talking bout the new birth I'm talking
[14:15] about the faith of Abraham what brother
[14:17] Graham sales we've somewhat less Sunday
[14:18] God the faith of Abraham God gave him a
[14:23] seal of circumcision as a sign of
[14:25] Abraham's faith so brother Branham said
[14:28] God gives you the baptism of Holy Ghost
[14:30] as of what as a sign of your faith that
[14:35] you believe that that's what God's gonna
[14:36] do
[14:37] but now remember we also had to go
[14:38] through where that Abraham ten or eleven
[14:42] years old later than that twelve years
[14:44] later took his son his only son up to a
[14:48] mountain up to a mountain everybody went
[14:52] home that up to a mountain and placed
[14:55] him not really placing Abraham but he
[14:58] all but he did look at Abraham he said
[15:00] Abraham I know now I know now Abraham
[15:05] that that faith is grounded now did God
[15:08] need to know that know he needed Abraham
[15:10] to know that that Abraham saw placing or
[15:13] adoption is your fourth is that all
[15:16] right because the fourth stage a lot of
[15:18] people don't get to the fourth stage a
[15:21] lot of people didn't get to the fourth
[15:23] stages brother Dale was talking about
[15:24] the son of God listen the son of god
[15:27] requirement is this right here
[15:32] that's what was required down through
[15:34] the seventh church ages is for them to
[15:36] get justified sanctified filled with the
[15:37] Holy Ghost a little bit of teaching in
[15:40] the first few church ages but now
[15:42] Columbo wasn't required to be adopted
[15:46] Luther wasn't required Wesley wasn't
[15:49] required Pentecost wasn't required but
[15:51] you and I because of the son of man
[15:53] because remember this comes to this guy
[15:58] full adoption are full full redemption
[16:03] we're going to see this also in the Book
[16:05] of Ruth because you see the journey of
[16:07] Ruth you've got to look at four stages
[16:09] just if you'll go to Scofield Bible even
[16:11] Scofield picks it up that's it's Ruth
[16:14] what deciding what did Abraham do he
[16:16] decided all right Ruth serving what
[16:20] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[16:23] serving our service thereby got that all
[16:27] right then you got the Holy Ghost of the
[16:28] new birth with us the circumcision you
[16:30] got Ruth resting and we're gonna get
[16:32] into that maybe if we'll get to that
[16:33] part where she rest at the feet of Boaz
[16:38] because you know what you can't give
[16:39] yourself the Holy Ghost it's gotta be
[16:42] the Redeemer God Almighty and human
[16:46] flesh had to come and die to give you
[16:48] the new Berk you can't give it to
[16:49] yourself
[16:50] so you just rest why Jesus had come all
[16:53] ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll
[16:55] give you rest there's not a certain day
[16:57] even Paul says there's not a certain day
[16:59] not the Sabbath the rest is why brother
[17:02] Brown said the rest was the baptism of
[17:04] the Holy Ghost all right then you're
[17:06] placing our adoption Ruth is rewarded
[17:10] for going through the journey and
[17:12] accepting all these things that we're
[17:14] going to talk about and she's rewarded
[17:17] with what a child with a child and that
[17:23] child through that child's lineage comes
[17:27] Christ David all the way down all right
[17:31] it's gonna be interesting right here in
[17:33] just a second but then you got your for
[17:34] combat base your line ox man in the
[17:36] eagle now watch the Eagle age the Eagle
[17:40] ages the high stages where everything
[17:42] you get up higher where you can see what
[17:45] the mountain and you can see that we
[17:47] need to come to adoption because if the
[17:51] son of man come to adoption we have to
[17:53] come to adoption and listen it wasn't
[17:56] the son of God needed to be adopted son
[18:00] of God Father the Son of man needed to
[18:04] be adopted to show that me and you need
[18:06] to be adopted or adopted are placing may
[18:10] we say either one because we're gonna
[18:12] talk about maybe next Sunday of the
[18:13] Sunday after how that that's what
[18:16] happened in the Old Testament with
[18:18] Joshua Moses took him to a certain place
[18:20] and he could see the promised lamb but
[18:23] Joshua the the Holy Ghost or Christ was
[18:26] the one that took the people over and
[18:29] positionally placed them in the land
[18:33] what'd he do he rewarded the children of
[18:36] Israel by giving them a certain piece of
[18:39] property because remember Abraham
[18:42] everywhere the sole of your feet touches
[18:44] that's your possession we're now from
[18:46] Abraham Isaac Isaac to Jacob Jacob was
[18:51] Israel so the children of Israel gets
[18:54] this blessing they get rewarded same way
[18:56] with you and I oh no doubt we get
[18:58] rewarded by having the baptism of the
[19:00] holy ghost no doubt that's God that's
[19:01] eternal life but God
[19:02] wants you to do more has God ever went
[19:06] backwards no man goes backwards we
[19:10] backslide God came back slide God keeps
[19:13] moving he keeps moving everything keeps
[19:15] moving forward that's why God had to
[19:18] send us the prophet in the end time a
[19:19] word prophet - what pull us pull us into
[19:25] a higher plane to pull us oh my it's
[19:28] it's hard I was telling them that Sunday
[19:30] School it's hard going up a hill when
[19:34] there's nothing there to go gift but
[19:36] when there's something up there if
[19:39] there's a big gold nugget as big as this
[19:41] room it's a lot easier you'll crawl
[19:45] scratch push pull but if there's nothing
[19:48] up there well we know there is we know
[19:51] there is what a body change waiting us
[19:54] on the top of that mountain no death is
[19:57] waiting us on the top of that mountain
[19:59] so the for combat beast you've got four
[20:01] stages four stages of what we're talking
[20:03] about roof for combat beast everybody
[20:06] got that say man alright so we good with
[20:08] that now let's go to the first first
[20:11] quote brother Brad mowing the
[20:14] kinsman-redeemer this is a good one to
[20:16] read if you want to read about the Book
[20:17] of Ruth where brother Branham says that
[20:19] this story was written I want just give
[20:21] you up this is the background because
[20:23] we're gonna teach a little bit on on
[20:24] each one of the of the characters in the
[20:27] Book of Ruth I think somebody just you
[20:29] said you read the Book of Ruth you just
[20:30] read a book okay all right well you're
[20:32] fixing that you're fixing to get a
[20:34] expanded version and this story was
[20:37] written in all the old manuscripts when
[20:39] they were segregating the Bible the holy
[20:41] men when they were trying to put it
[20:43] together do y'all realize there's books
[20:46] out there that they didn't put in they
[20:47] was book of Job Oh
[20:49] book of macabees there was a book of
[20:52] something else that was not included
[20:53] because they the holy men said no that's
[20:56] not that's not in other words it was the
[20:59] Holy Ghost telling because we know it
[21:00] was the Holy Ghost telling but what this
[21:02] Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding
[21:04] books that they accepted why if it's
[21:08] just a love story why would the writers
[21:10] and ancient sages accept this book as
[21:12] inspired because remember every book in
[21:14] the Bible is inspired
[21:16] ayman Esther even all that in this book
[21:18] here watch what he said though because
[21:22] there's a hidden revelation in it and in
[21:26] this hidden revelation you catch the
[21:28] real meaning and it'll bring you closer
[21:31] to God so everybody that wants to be
[21:33] closer to God we're fixing to get it so
[21:37] that's what he said you catch the real
[21:38] meaning so we're gonna look at today I
[21:40] hope we'll catch the real meaning I pray
[21:43] my whole soul this morning that God will
[21:45] catch every heart so spellbound till
[21:48] he'll reveal himself just what he is in
[21:51] this story because it's a story of a
[21:53] natural person it's an example to us
[21:55] what he is to you how to accept him so
[22:00] how do you accept Christ you got to go
[22:01] through justification sanctification in
[22:03] the baptismal oligos alright and when
[22:05] you want see it it's so simple you
[22:08] wonder how you ever went over the top of
[22:11] it but it can only be revealed by the
[22:13] Holy Spirit everybody got that same man
[22:16] and man so we're right on it right all
[22:19] right so now we're going to start into
[22:22] the Book of Ruth if you'll pull Ruth
[22:25] chapter 1 and remember Ruth is in four
[22:32] parts I kind of got a little bit of want
[22:34] to tell you about a little background on
[22:37] Ruth you know Ruth is one of the four
[22:39] women that there's a lineage in the book
[22:41] of Matthew there's a lineage if
[22:43] so-and-so begotten so on so on so on so
[22:45] but got sawing something well there's
[22:47] only four times in that lineage from
[22:49] Abraham to Christ that there's four
[22:53] women inserted all the other one is
[22:57] solomon begat obed I mean Boaz and bowie
[23:00] but right in there it says Tamar Rahab
[23:06] Ruth now remember you got to remember
[23:10] who is Rahab
[23:12] she's Gentile right Gentile prostitute
[23:15] but she marries Salman which is Boaz's
[23:19] mom and daddy and then Boaz mares are
[23:24] more - look how many people see that's
[23:26] why little Jews
[23:28] times they don't understand the Old
[23:29] Testament because there's so many
[23:31] Gentiles put into the inserted into that
[23:34] into that lineage they're going how this
[23:37] has got to be pure God told us we're not
[23:39] supposed to deal and you here comes
[23:41] Salman she mares the prostitute they
[23:44] have a baby called Boaz he types Christ
[23:46] he marries a woman called Ruth and she's
[23:49] the mole bodice and she's top of the
[23:51] bride so you can't really figure God out
[23:54] but this is what's gonna happen look
[23:57] that she's one of the four women in the
[23:58] lineage of Christ which would be
[24:00] tomorrow Ahab Ruth and Mary obviously
[24:03] all right now remember before we get
[24:06] started chapter one is deciding right
[24:11] roots gotta make a decision
[24:14] Abraham Abram had to make a decision and
[24:18] remember now we got to keep them
[24:20] separated to get the story right now
[24:23] Naomi and her husband Elimelech are Jews
[24:30] okay they lived in Bethlehem Judith what
[24:34] a place to live what a place to begin
[24:38] the story but now watch just as Abram
[24:42] had to leave his country because of a
[24:44] famine they're fixing to have to do the
[24:47] same thing everybody got that so then
[24:51] you've got roots and Orpha roots and
[24:55] Orpha are Moabites so they're Gentiles
[24:59] you got Naomi man Elimelech and they
[25:02] have two children named mainly on and
[25:05] jelly on Charlie on all right and we'll
[25:07] get into what their names mean in a
[25:08] minute but we'll read it but I want you
[25:11] to keep that in your mind that Ruth is a
[25:14] mole by Orpha is a Moabite naomi is a
[25:18] Jew and the limo which is a Jew because
[25:20] you got to see the types here everybody
[25:22] got that
[25:22] all right now in Chapter one let's start
[25:26] and remember now we're typing
[25:29] justification and you need to put can
[25:34] you pull that one back up where it says
[25:36] root chapter one because I want you to
[25:38] maybe you can see this a little better
[25:39] now
[25:41] right here where it says Ruth chapter
[25:43] one deciding Naomi old Jewish church
[25:46] would you do with that okay so here we
[25:48] got your four if you want to write these
[25:49] down if you want to just remember them
[25:50] in chapter one now Boaz doesn't show up
[25:54] to later on but Naomi is going to be a
[25:57] kite of the old Jewish church everybody
[26:00] got that Naomi as a type of the old
[26:04] Jewish Orthodox Church Orpha is the type
[26:08] of the denominational Church cuz you're
[26:10] gonna see her she's gonna try to make a
[26:11] decision
[26:12] but once Naomi really pressures her she
[26:15] turns and goes right back into her
[26:18] denominational Church okay so she made a
[26:21] decision it was the wrong one but she
[26:23] made that decision Ruth is the type of
[26:25] the Gentile bride that says wherever you
[26:27] go I'll go your God to be my god I'll be
[26:29] right here with you the whole time
[26:31] then Boaz is absolutely we know that
[26:34] bull has is the type of crosses
[26:35] everybody got there so there's your for
[26:38] now we know there's one or two inserted
[26:40] in there we're gonna see one that's
[26:41] going to type to devil but those are
[26:44] your four main characters even my launch
[26:47] I'll on and Elimelech they all die
[26:49] because remember think about this to
[26:53] begin your story to begin your story now
[26:58] you're married to somebody else right
[27:02] the devil your old husband's got to be
[27:06] dead before you suck you can do
[27:07] something so the old husbands have got
[27:10] to be dead of every one of these for
[27:13] them to make a decision so now let's go
[27:14] back to Ruth chapter one and go that's
[27:19] all right we'll go verse by verse is
[27:20] that okay now it came to pass in the
[27:23] days when the judges ruled I remember
[27:25] there was no prophets on the scene this
[27:27] was in the time of the judges that there
[27:29] was a famine in the land now what
[27:32] happened in Abraham's time same thing
[27:34] comes up God calls Abram he gets up and
[27:36] gets ready to leave he goes over into
[27:38] Canaan and they're already in Bethlehem
[27:42] they're in the promised land this man
[27:46] named Elimelech and Naomi but when the
[27:49] famine comes remember I told you about a
[27:52] famine what are you gonna do you got to
[27:53] make a decision
[27:54] a famine makes you make a decision to
[27:57] stay or move
[27:57] well they got up and moved and their
[28:00] first problem was same way brother Brown
[28:02] said about Abram his first problem was
[28:03] he got up and went
[28:04] Egypt top of the world first thing they
[28:07] did they went from Bethlehem the
[28:09] Promised Land of God to a gaggy place
[28:13] brother ram calls it because you know
[28:16] what happened was mobile the morbot come
[28:18] from lot and having relationship with
[28:22] his own two daughters and brother Brown
[28:24] said it's been a gaggy thing ever since
[28:26] that's what he says I didn't bring that
[28:28] quote but brother I'm calls it a hair in
[28:29] the biscuit as southerners we would know
[28:33] that if he was preaching the people up
[28:34] in the different up in North they
[28:36] probably wouldn't know what that was but
[28:37] you know it's like finding a hair in
[28:39] your food yeah that's what he's talking
[28:42] about his herring the best you find the
[28:43] hand you will see is what he said this
[28:45] is this is this is to promise children
[28:49] leaving the promised land and heading
[28:53] down into Egypt or heading down into
[28:54] Moab all right
[28:57] so they went it's a sojourn in the
[28:58] country of Moab he and his wife and two
[29:00] sons and the name of the man was
[29:03] Elimelech now lemma which means my God
[29:08] is king I'll read the ones on here if
[29:11] you got Scofield Bibles right in the
[29:13] middle of it Bethlehem Judea is the
[29:15] house of brick we know what that is
[29:17] Bethlehem means the house of bread or
[29:18] the house of God's bread because
[29:20] remember they gotta come back they got
[29:23] to come back to that you and I have to
[29:26] come back to them and the name of the
[29:29] man was Elimelech in the name of his
[29:30] wife was Naomi then Naomi at this moment
[29:32] means Pleasant and the name of his two
[29:35] sons Madeline and Charlie on effort
[29:38] thoughts of Bethlehem Judea now male on
[29:40] means I don't know if I'd I don't know
[29:42] if I'd marry this guy or not then my
[29:45] lord means sick Charlie on means pining
[29:51] a whiner okey-dokey then
[29:58] but they came into the country of Moab
[30:00] and continued there and Elimelech
[30:04] Naomi's husband died now remember she
[30:08] said you
[30:09] but their boys took wives of the women
[30:14] of Moab which was orphan orphan means
[30:18] hind or phone in other words a baby
[30:24] behind her phone is a baby animal and
[30:27] the name of the other was Ruth and Ruth
[30:30] means friendship or beauty and they
[30:34] dwell there about ten years so they
[30:36] dwell there for a while now remember
[30:37] they got to make a decision though
[30:40] because now Malin and Charlie undyed
[30:42] also both of them and the women were
[30:45] left of her two sons and her husband now
[30:48] you know the old start the story back in
[30:50] the old testament is that if the brother
[30:53] died without having children his other
[30:56] brother are the are the mother had to
[30:59] have another son and that's what she's
[31:01] fixing to tell him she said you get
[31:03] Naomi's going I'm old now are you gonna
[31:06] wait on me I don't know if I got another
[31:07] kid in my womb you know another man so
[31:10] she makes them make a decision that's
[31:12] why God has you come to a place just
[31:14] like we talked about in Abram you come
[31:16] to a place in justifications where you
[31:18] got to make a decision you have an she'd
[31:22] they both had to decide when she arose
[31:25] with their daughters-in-law and I
[31:26] remember their daughters-in-law so
[31:27] they're more biased and she's a Jew
[31:29] alright that's that might that she might
[31:33] return from the country of Moab for she
[31:36] had heard in the country of Moab how
[31:37] that the Lord had visited his people see
[31:39] God started putting everything back in
[31:44] Bethlehem because they got to make a
[31:45] decision to go back there because
[31:48] remember Abram went into Egypt remember
[31:51] all those things happened down there and
[31:52] he had to come back out and go back into
[31:54] Canaan so this is the perfect type of
[31:56] Abram and the believer and the book and
[32:00] Ruth is doing the same thing to me Ruth
[32:03] is closer because Ruth is a female and
[32:06] that's all of us we're bride we're
[32:08] female we're a Gentile bride
[32:10] alright wherefore she went forth out of
[32:15] the place where she was and her two
[32:16] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[32:17] on the way to return into the land of
[32:19] Judah and Naomi said in her tutu
[32:22] Luongo returned each to her mother's
[32:25] house the Lord deal kindly kindly with
[32:27] you in other words she's not rebuking
[32:29] him she's saying look the Lord grants
[32:31] you that may find rest each of you in
[32:33] the house of her husband because
[32:35] remember the only thing they had was
[32:37] their husbands were dead they didn't
[32:39] have no inheritance in in Judah all
[32:43] their inheritance they were immobilized
[32:45] they had to go back and find their
[32:46] mobile by parents and that's where they
[32:49] had an inheritance they had no
[32:51] inheritance going to Judah they okay
[32:53] with that 10-blade with you and I if you
[32:57] don't make it this right decision you go
[32:59] right back into the world where you were
[33:00] in and then the Lord grant you that you
[33:03] may find rest each of you in the house
[33:05] of her husband then she kissed them and
[33:06] they lifted up their voice and wept now
[33:08] look they both said right here and they
[33:10] said unto her surely we will return with
[33:12] thee and to thy people
[33:14] now watch Naomi Naomi said turn again my
[33:20] daughters why will you go with me are
[33:24] there yet any more sons in my womb that
[33:27] they may be your husband's in other
[33:28] words there's gonna have to wait sixteen
[33:30] or seventeen more years and they were
[33:33] going to be 16 or 17 more years older
[33:35] even if Naomi could find a husband and
[33:37] have a child that may not even been a
[33:40] boy so Naomi is giving them the
[33:44] worst-case-scenario
[33:49] turn again my daughters go your way for
[33:51] I'm too old to have a husband if I
[33:53] should say I have hope if I should have
[33:55] a husband also tonight and should also
[33:57] bear sons would you tarry for them till
[34:00] they were grown now look
[34:03] orphan is taking this all in with
[34:06] circumstances amen she's taking this all
[34:13] in with all these circumstances how many
[34:15] times have we talked about circumstances
[34:19] Ruth is going don't care I'm going back
[34:25] with you orphans going well I gotta wait
[34:29] 17 more years I I probably gray headed
[34:32] now probably too old to have it and you
[34:33] understand circumstances I thought the
[34:35] devil gonna do he's gonna give you
[34:36] circumstances and he did the same thing
[34:39] with Orpha he gave her circumstances
[34:41] would you tell you for them till they
[34:42] were grown would you stay for them from
[34:45] having husbands name my daughters for it
[34:47] grieveth me much for your state that the
[34:49] hand of the Lord is going against me now
[34:51] in her grief the Lord's right there on
[34:54] the scene because he's right in this
[34:56] whole plan and they lifted up their
[34:59] voice and wept again and Orpha kissed
[35:01] her mother-in-law but Ruth Clavin to her
[35:03] in other words Orphic kissed her kissed
[35:05] the old Jewish church and said I'm going
[35:07] back because that's what I like I like
[35:10] to go back that way kind of like Lot's
[35:15] wife they got turned into a pillar of
[35:16] salt she did come out for a little way
[35:19] but you know what she done she turned in
[35:21] the look because she liked it back there
[35:22] rather than keep on going with life same
[35:26] way with Ruth Ruth clave unto her and
[35:28] she said Behold our sister-in-law has
[35:30] gone back into her people into her God's
[35:35] cards now see Abraham Abram could have
[35:39] made that same decision Abram could have
[35:41] said yep
[35:42] I think I'll go back make my loans
[35:44] member we talked about that and be a
[35:46] good safe place to go circumstances but
[35:48] Abram said now we're going this way
[35:52] she said behold thy sister-in-law is
[35:54] going back into her people and to her
[35:55] gods return thou after thy sister-in-law
[35:58] Andrew said entreat me not to leave thee
[36:02] or to refer return from following after
[36:06] thee for whether thou goest I will go
[36:08] and whether they'll lodgest I will Lodge
[36:11] thy people
[36:13] here's the decision that people shall be
[36:16] my people and thy God my God my God will
[36:23] be your God that's why listen folks
[36:27] that's why that when we make a decision
[36:30] we're making the decision listen to me
[36:33] based on the old Jewish because that's
[36:40] Jehovah God one not these three God
[36:44] things that we got now and all this
[36:45] other stuff we're going back when we
[36:47] receive when we
[36:49] as Christians when we walk with God
[36:52] we're telling the Jews
[36:55] what don't you tell what brother I'm
[36:56] telling you the Jew said well we don't
[36:58] cut him up in three pieces brother
[36:59] Graham said well I don't either
[37:01] he said well bless you son why cuz
[37:03] that's the original and the Old
[37:06] Testament is the original Jehovah God
[37:08] one God that we're supposed to follow
[37:11] where thou diced well I'd uh and there
[37:16] will I be buried the Lord do so to me
[37:18] and more also if aught but death Part D
[37:21] in me she had made such a decision till
[37:25] wherever Naomi's going I'm going with
[37:29] you
[37:29] all right now remember though she had
[37:31] zero inheritance zero inheritance
[37:36] because her husband had died they had no
[37:40] children to pass that inheritance onto
[37:42] all right Naomi's husband had died but
[37:44] she had listened she had inheritance the
[37:49] original Jews still have inheritance I'm
[37:51] telling you God's not gonna forget them
[37:54] they're gonna get that land in the
[37:55] Millenium whatever they've done in the
[37:58] past has been forgiven that's
[38:00] justification they put him on a cross
[38:06] and he still forgave them so they're
[38:12] gonna get an inheritance but you and I
[38:16] are the wife because remember Naomi
[38:21] wasn't the wife - Boaz Ruth was the wife
[38:27] - beau as we get Christ
[38:31] Naomi gets a blessing Naomi gets caught
[38:34] under redemption Naomi gets all of her
[38:36] possession back but she never gets Boaz
[38:41] you and I get Boaz hey man what a
[38:45] beautiful picture when she saw that she
[38:48] was steadfast that's what God wants he
[38:50] wants to know if you know that you know
[38:53] so they too went until they came to
[38:56] Bethlehem know what this is so beautiful
[38:59] brother mark did you get this
[39:01] what time did they get to Bethlehem so
[39:07] they too went until they came to
[39:09] Bethlehem nether hidden by and come back
[39:11] and it came to pass when they were come
[39:13] to Bethlehem that all the city was moved
[39:15] about them they said is this Naomi she's
[39:20] back
[39:21] remember she'd be gone for ten years
[39:23] she'd been out of the picture she's
[39:26] going back to her homeland and she said
[39:29] unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara
[39:32] because Mara means bitter member of the
[39:35] marijuana the bitter waters brother
[39:39] Brahm tells us
[39:40] I didn't bring all the quotes brother
[39:42] mom tells us at that point that Naomi is
[39:44] looking across Jerusalem and she's
[39:47] crying she's crying she's coming back
[39:51] home this is what I got written in my
[39:54] Bible that brother brown said the Jews
[39:56] are returning to their homeland right
[39:59] here this is the Jews returning to the
[40:02] homeland saying I'm back in the Promised
[40:05] Land because God's not gonna deal with
[40:06] them until they come back to the
[40:08] promised land call me that don't call me
[40:10] Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty I've
[40:12] dealt very bitterly with me I went out
[40:14] full and the Lord had brought me home
[40:16] empty why then call me now Naomi seeing
[40:21] the Lord has testified against me and
[40:23] the Almighty has afflicted me all those
[40:26] years you can say the Jews can say hey I
[40:29] was killed by the millions during Hitler
[40:32] I went out forward with the promise but
[40:36] I'm coming back empty but God says I
[40:38] don't worry about it I've got you
[40:40] covered
[40:41] this is just chapter one of four
[40:44] chapters of this story don't worry
[40:46] because I'm going to bring you right
[40:47] back into the end because you've seen
[40:50] Naomi from this point forward naomi is
[40:53] kind of just kind severy once in a while
[40:57] and kind of nudges and Ruth in but at
[41:00] the very end she comes back into what
[41:02] because remember Boaz doesn't redeem
[41:04] Ruth first he Reedy has to redeem Naomi
[41:12] first to get Ruth he had to redeem his
[41:15] well first Father forgive them they know
[41:18] not what they're doing but knowing that
[41:20] he was going to get a Gentile bride out
[41:21] of it
[41:22] hey that so Naomi turned in ruth the
[41:26] moabite us her daughter-in-law with her
[41:28] which returned out of the country of
[41:30] Moab another come back to Bethlehem when
[41:33] at the beginning of the harvest not at
[41:39] the beginning of the planting this is
[41:41] the beginning of the latter rain harvest
[41:46] that's menu we've come back to Bethlehem
[41:50] we've come back to our promised land at
[41:52] the beginning of the harvest because
[41:55] God's getting ready right now to take
[41:57] what harvest harvest - but - you got to
[42:01] see the pipes because barley means life
[42:04] they come back now to where they're
[42:06] going to take life and make bread out of
[42:10] it oh it's a beautiful picture man it's
[42:14] wonderful wonderful picture so now let's
[42:16] go to Ruth chapter 2 because remember
[42:18] Ruth chapter 2 is what you got to keep
[42:20] looking now Ruth chapter 2 that one
[42:23] chapter one was deciding that was
[42:26] justification he she had to make a
[42:28] decision she had to go with God
[42:31] she went with Naomi who was going with
[42:33] God so you got to keep Naomi in there
[42:35] but now remember here is where the
[42:39] connection is because remember Christ
[42:47] came to his own and his own received him
[42:50] not because look the near kinsman was -
[42:54] Naomi not to Ruth the near kinsman was
[42:58] to Naomi the Jew not to remember even
[43:02] even God tells him says look don't even
[43:04] go out there to those Gentiles go to
[43:08] Europe my people because remember he had
[43:10] to come to them first he had to come
[43:14] this first cause he wrote this and he
[43:17] knew what this type was and Naomi had a
[43:20] kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of
[43:23] wealth of the family of a moment of
[43:26] Elimelech
[43:28] and his name was Boaz now Boaz is the
[43:31] one that does the redeeming right
[43:33] he's the kinsman redeemer now like what
[43:37] brother Brown says - he says look he
[43:39] said it couldn't just Bend just any
[43:40] kinfolk this guy's got to be wealthy
[43:47] he's got to own the whole world
[43:51] he couldn't be just somebody that made
[43:54] us scratched off a living no this guy
[43:56] that she met had to be the king of the
[43:59] world so Naomi had a kinsman of her
[44:03] husband's a mighty man of wealth now
[44:04] remember we're getting into what Ruth's
[44:06] serving this is sanctification cleaned
[44:09] and set aside for service watch what
[44:11] Naomi does with Ruth because watch Ruth
[44:15] is fixing - coming to the picture no
[44:16] one's gonna step to the side because you
[44:19] know what she's still there Boaz is the
[44:24] only kinfolk she has nearer kinsman at
[44:28] the moment I said at the moment cuz you
[44:30] got to let the story unfold don't
[44:32] remember there was one in between that
[44:34] we got to deal with in a little while
[44:36] not right now all right
[44:38] and Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi
[44:40] let me now go to the field and glean
[44:42] ears of corn after him and who Silas
[44:46] shall find Grace and Naomi said unto her
[44:49] go my daughter now remember she had no
[44:52] guidance where to go
[44:55] Naomi didn't say go get in his field
[44:57] right here but watch what happened and
[44:59] she went Ruth and came and gleaned in
[45:02] the field after the Reapers and her HAP
[45:06] you know what that word means her
[45:10] fortune her happenstance she didn't just
[45:16] happen upon this field brother Brown
[45:19] says in one quote I got here she was led
[45:20] by the Holy Ghost to go to that field
[45:22] just like you and I are led by the Holy
[45:25] Ghost to go to a certain place Amen
[45:27] because remember we're in sanctification
[45:29] and she went came and gleaned in the
[45:31] field now what's she doing she's picking
[45:33] up food brother Brahim says one time I
[45:37] didn't bring all the quotes so you might
[45:39] get finished with this if not that's
[45:41] okay
[45:42] the RAM says she was poor look when
[45:45] Naomi comes back with Ruth dragging
[45:47] along behind her she don't have no
[45:49] possession she's been 10 years gone her
[45:52] property's been sold it's been probably
[45:54] chopped up in different ways her houses
[45:57] she won't have a house to go to they
[45:59] have to find a little rent shack
[46:00] somewhere and they only so old she's
[46:04] sending a little young Ruth to work
[46:06] that's what brother Brown says this in
[46:08] the quote right here she had to work she
[46:11] said I like that he said a believer said
[46:14] when you first start out you poor you
[46:18] know what I mean poor so you have to
[46:19] work you have to work at it
[46:21] sanctification is a work justification
[46:23] is work a week they will know got you
[46:27] two just broke right and just lay that
[46:29] barley down right at her feet and know
[46:31] you got something to do with it you're
[46:35] still deciding but you gotta serve
[46:38] before God can see because at this point
[46:41] in time Boaz doesn't know Ruth doesn't
[46:45] know who she is yet and her hat was too
[46:50] light on the part of the field belonging
[46:52] to Boaz who was of the kindred I'm
[46:54] Elimelech and behold Boaz came from
[46:58] where what was Christ born
[46:59] that's him okay and sending to the
[47:03] Reapers the Lord be with you and they
[47:07] answered him the Lord blessed day their
[47:11] brother Evan talks about the Reapers
[47:12] being angels and the Reapers being
[47:14] preachers
[47:14] she gets into right field here's the
[47:16] right sermon pretty good huh
[47:20] then said Boaz into his servant that was
[47:23] set over the Reapers there's this church
[47:27] coming up here uh-huh
[47:29] who is this who is this woman that she
[47:33] looks a little different than the rest
[47:34] of these people that I've been dealing
[47:36] with and the servant that was set over
[47:38] the Reapers answered and said it is the
[47:40] MOBOTIX damsel now right there most
[47:43] people would have said who ya know ain't
[47:47] dealing with that woman she's a Gentile
[47:49] but no boys saw her character he saw her
[47:55] character and
[47:56] heard from her servants that she was a
[47:59] virtuous woman you'll see this coming a
[48:01] little bit further
[48:02] it is the MOBOTIX damsel that came back
[48:05] with Naomi boom
[48:06] Boaz says I'm kin to Naomi she's lost
[48:14] everything she's got and she's brought
[48:17] this beautiful lady that's not out there
[48:20] saying bless God I'm gonna take all the
[48:21] food out of your field and the Reapers
[48:23] get behind me
[48:24] no she waits till the Reapers get
[48:28] finished and she goes by and picks up
[48:29] just enough for her and Naomi to make
[48:31] cakes with his brother man will tell you
[48:33] makes cakes with mashes her the corn up
[48:36] and makes cakes for them to survive
[48:39] barely survived it is the mobilis damsel
[48:43] that came back when they only out of the
[48:44] country of Moab and she said I pray you
[48:48] let me glean and gather after the
[48:51] Reapers now this isn't Ruth talking to
[48:53] the Reaper she walks into this field
[48:55] humble virtuous humble woman the true
[48:59] church and says I'll just take what's
[49:02] left
[49:03] just give me what's left so she came and
[49:08] have continued look this I'm just gonna
[49:15] say it and she continued even from the
[49:17] morning until now
[49:19] and she tarried a little while she
[49:21] rested a little bit but she's been
[49:23] working since sunup
[49:24] she's comes to every service she reads
[49:28] her Bible she studies Boaz is looking at
[49:32] the character but he's listening from
[49:34] the servants that's been in the field
[49:36] whether the whole time what kind of
[49:38] woman this is didn't said Boaz under
[49:41] Ruth harristown not my daughter
[49:44] don't ought to glean in another field
[49:48] don't go listen to another preacher oh
[49:51] that's what brother Brown says I'm done
[49:54] that's like all these quotes laid out
[49:55] here if you need them I got them right
[49:57] here
[49:57] but brother Brown says you're in my
[50:01] field you don't need to go to another
[50:04] field you don't need to get fed in four
[50:06] or five different fields you need to get
[50:07] fed in my field so any what I'm
[50:10] saying it's not here here I'm just
[50:11] saying any holy ghost preacher that
[50:13] preaches the Word of God you need to be
[50:15] in their field you need to be in their
[50:17] field not jumping from one field to the
[50:19] other because look neither go from hence
[50:21] but abide here fast by my maidens let
[50:25] thine eyes be on the field that they do
[50:27] reap and go thou after them have I not
[50:30] charged the young men that they shall
[50:32] not touch thee remember she's a virtuous
[50:34] woman and when thou are at thirst going
[50:38] to the vessels vessels vessels and drink
[50:46] water which the young men have drawn
[50:51] then she fell on her face and bowed
[50:53] herself to the ground and said unto him
[50:55] why have I found grace in nine eyes that
[50:59] thou should have take knowledge of me
[51:01] seeing I am a stranger look how humble
[51:04] she's not doing this out of spite she's
[51:06] not doing this cuz she's doing it
[51:08] because she said why in the world
[51:11] because remember she doesn't know who
[51:13] Boaz this she's only in sanctification
[51:17] she don't know everything about her mate
[51:18] yet Naomi's got the connection because
[51:21] remember she's gonna go back home and
[51:23] tell Naomi here in just a few minutes
[51:25] hey Naomi's like where'd you get all
[51:28] this word where'd you get all this food
[51:33] oh I just happened to be in this field
[51:37] to this man they called Boaz and then
[51:38] Naomi's like oh Lord
[51:40] the hand of God this is my kinfolk my
[51:45] nearest kid how'd you find him that's a
[51:50] beautiful picture I'm telling you you
[51:52] you just keep cleaning and gleaning out
[51:54] of this thing Boaz answered and said
[51:58] unto me look it has fully fully been
[52:00] showed me all that thou has done until I
[52:04] mother-in-law somebody has told him a
[52:07] story remember the Holy Ghost comes and
[52:10] tells the father this is a good son this
[52:13] is a bad son that's what the Holy Ghost
[52:14] is giving for what the leaders and guys
[52:16] into all truth and what to show our
[52:18] character because we're talking about
[52:21] character here because remember Boaz
[52:22] does not
[52:23] we know who she is until somebody tells
[52:25] him who she is now look since the death
[52:28] of line husband her denominational
[52:34] husband's dad so I can marry her now
[52:37] he's got that in his planning in his
[52:39] mind because she's beautiful she's
[52:41] virtuous nobody said one word bad about
[52:43] her
[52:44] that's sanctification cleaned and set
[52:48] aside for service hey man let's see just
[52:51] to me it's just you just sit there and
[52:53] read it you you keep writing notes and
[52:56] keep writing notes and keep writing
[52:57] notes but watch this and Boaz answered
[53:03] and said unto her it had fully been
[53:05] showed me all that thou hast done unto
[53:10] thy mother-in-law since the death of thy
[53:13] husband and how thou hast left thy
[53:17] father and thy mother and the land of
[53:20] thine activity what you made a decision
[53:22] to turn and go in another direction and
[53:25] headed right straight toward poets and
[53:29] aren't coming to a people which thou
[53:32] knewest not heretofore the Lord
[53:36] recompense thy work o my work sacrifice
[53:40] serving sanctification God wants to did
[53:44] why did God give you a new spirit he can
[53:46] give you the Holy Spirit to give you a
[53:47] new spirit what see if you'd come to
[53:49] church see if you would pray see if you
[53:51] would study see if you would do the
[53:53] things of God amen
[53:54] not for God's benefit but for ours so
[53:58] Boaz is watching Ruth to see I wonder if
[54:02] she'll show up to church tomorrow I
[54:03] wonder if she'll show up to this field
[54:05] again tomorrow well you know what she
[54:07] comes back every day
[54:08] she shows her virtue by her actions
[54:13] right then she said let me find favor oh
[54:16] I'm sorry
[54:17] the Lord recompense that work and a full
[54:20] reward be given the of the Lord God of
[54:25] Israel kept wolrd under whose wings thou
[54:31] art come to trust under eagle's wings
[54:36] are you covered then she said let me
[54:40] find favor in thy sight my Lord Lord let
[54:45] me be worthy of what you've give me even
[54:48] in sanctification let me be worthy of
[54:50] what you've get this new spirit you've
[54:53] gave me this new field that I'm gleaning
[54:55] out of now this new word that I'm I've
[54:58] been in I've been in a famine down in
[55:00] the world but now you put me in the
[55:03] right field and I'm in the right
[55:05] position and I'm in the right place and
[55:07] I'm hearing the right word and I'm what
[55:09] I'm growing in God then she said let me
[55:14] find favor in thy sight my lord for that
[55:18] thou hast comforted me and for that thou
[55:21] has spoken friendly until then had made
[55:24] though I be not like any of that
[55:26] handmaids
[55:27] in other words that like brother Branham
[55:29] says he says look you start wearing
[55:30] dress you quit cuttin your hair you quit
[55:32] wearing makeup you guys quit going to
[55:33] the bars you could a sanctification
[55:35] you're in a new group of people you
[55:37] don't like that other group of people
[55:38] you're in a new group of people and Boaz
[55:41] said unto her at mealtime comes out
[55:44] Heather what time when it's time to eat
[55:46] and eat of the bread and dip the morsel
[55:49] in the vinegar not just coming glean
[55:51] she's got all this she's got to carry
[55:53] back and beat it up and make flour and
[55:56] mate meal no he said come unto me I've
[56:00] got already the bread made I've already
[56:03] got this vinegar here and she sat beside
[56:06] the Reapers and he reached her parts
[56:09] corn and she did eat and was suffice and
[56:13] left and when she was risen up to glean
[56:17] Boaz commanded his young men saying let
[56:21] her glean even among the sheaves and
[56:23] burp oats were not because remember God
[56:25] made a provision for poor people in the
[56:27] Old Testament remember in the fields you
[56:29] were supposed to cut the corner if I
[56:31] understand what I'm saying you have a
[56:33] corner like this you're supposed to
[56:34] clean like this and leave a corner for
[56:38] the poor and they could go in and they
[56:40] could glean he's giving her the whole
[56:42] field you just go right behind the
[56:45] Reapers and whatever they drop don't be
[56:47] out
[56:48] the corners over just getting a little
[56:49] bit of word no get out here in this
[56:52] field and let fall also some of the
[56:56] handfuls of purpose we've heard the
[56:58] songs of hands full of purpose watch
[57:00] brother Brad and brother Bob tells us he
[57:03] says God drops you a little revelation
[57:08] God drops you a little revival God drops
[57:12] you a little stimulation God drops your
[57:14] revelation in your field and he actually
[57:19] says handfuls on purpose God drops
[57:23] little handfuls of purpose through the
[57:26] Reapers through the what through the
[57:27] preachers every once in a while when you
[57:30] come to church I said every once in a
[57:31] while because you might not get
[57:33] something every time you come to church
[57:34] but every once in a while the Reaper or
[57:39] the grill are the Gleaners the preachers
[57:42] the sons kill teachers the Deacons the
[57:44] elders is going to lay you a little bit
[57:46] of hand full of purpose every once in a
[57:48] while they're going to give you a little
[57:49] revelation and lead them that she may
[57:52] glean them and rebuke her not so she
[57:56] gleaned in the field not in the corner
[57:58] she gleaned in the field until the
[58:01] evening time and she took what she had
[58:05] harvested you got to go beat it out
[58:10] somewhere like me all of us in
[58:15] sanctification you got to go somewhere
[58:16] and you got to beat it out whatever food
[58:19] you get you got to beat it out you come
[58:21] to place where you clap you gotta beat
[58:24] it out man what you're fighting with the
[58:26] devil you fight well that old nature you
[58:27] fight but you gonna what you're gonna
[58:29] beat it out so that you can eat and let
[58:34] her fall some handful to purpose and
[58:35] leave them that she may glean them in
[58:37] rebuke or not and she gleaned in the
[58:40] field until the evening time and beat
[58:42] out that she had gleaned and it was
[58:44] about any path of barley and she took it
[58:46] up and went into the city in other words
[58:48] she's heading back home and her
[58:50] mother-in-law Naomi the Jew saw what she
[58:53] had gleaned and she brought forth and
[58:56] gave to her that head look that's that
[58:59] one more time gave to her
[59:01] that she had reserved after she was
[59:04] finished eating and the mother lost they
[59:07] were in the world did you get all his
[59:09] food right and the mother-in-law said
[59:12] unto her warehouse down between today
[59:14] and we're honest there blessed be he
[59:17] that did take knowledge of thee
[59:19] she don't know it's her kin folks yet
[59:22] you know what the old Orthodox Church is
[59:25] watching us now the old Jews are
[59:29] watching us remember brother Brahim says
[59:30] they think he's coming back for them and
[59:32] he's coming back to get us
[59:33] well that's what's happening the old
[59:35] mother-in-law sale where'd you get this
[59:37] revelation where'd you get all this food
[59:40] through to witnesses they're going to
[59:43] get that food hey man those guards gonna
[59:48] leave us and go them that's why we're at
[59:51] the very end of this thing you're gonna
[59:53] see Naomi she's gonna get the baby that
[59:56] Boaz and Ruth house and the Bible says
[1:00:01] she becomes the nurse so in other words
[1:00:03] she becomes the wet nurse she becomes
[1:00:05] the one that feeds the baby while Naomi
[1:00:08] and Ruth are out of the picture lots of
[1:00:10] great what a picture and we may not get
[1:00:12] to it I'm gonna try to stop it 2:30 and
[1:00:17] she showed her mother-in-law with whom
[1:00:19] she had rod and said the man's name with
[1:00:21] him I rocked today is Boaz and Naomi
[1:00:28] said unto her daughter-in-law let's be
[1:00:31] he of the Lord who hath not left off his
[1:00:34] kindness to the living into the dead and
[1:00:36] the only senator this man is near of
[1:00:38] Kenan to us one of our next kinsman in
[1:00:44] other words you know what happened
[1:00:47] Louise Ruth comes in and lays down what
[1:00:56] she had got and Naomi says would you get
[1:01:03] those cars
[1:01:06] there in Jeremiah forever it isn't where
[1:01:09] did you get those scars what in other
[1:01:10] words where did you get all this because
[1:01:13] she says in the house of my friends and
[1:01:17] then they always like no that's my near
[1:01:20] kinsman that's not just somebody out in
[1:01:23] the field
[1:01:24] that's my near kinsman that guy can get
[1:01:26] me out of the trouble I'm in and that's
[1:01:29] what they're gonna say you know and when
[1:01:31] we leave through two witnesses they're
[1:01:34] gonna realize that their bull has come
[1:01:38] home that their bow ass have took Naomi
[1:01:42] but in taking Naomi they forgot about
[1:01:45] Ruth where'd you get those scars in the
[1:01:53] house and my friends in ruth the moabite
[1:01:57] a-- said he said unto me also thou shalt
[1:02:00] keep fast by my young men until they
[1:02:03] have ended all my harvest and Naomi said
[1:02:07] unto Ruth her daughter lo it is good my
[1:02:09] daughter that thou go out with his
[1:02:12] maidens that they may meet the not in
[1:02:15] any other field so she kept fast by the
[1:02:19] maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
[1:02:23] the barley harvest and of wheat harvest
[1:02:27] and dwelt with her mother-in-law what a
[1:02:33] great picture though of Ruth serving are
[1:02:38] going through sanctification you watch
[1:02:40] all the thing all the whole process that
[1:02:42] went through the same thing Abram went
[1:02:43] through Abram had to go what Abram had
[1:02:46] to God tells him to bring three Rams and
[1:02:48] three this and three that and bring this
[1:02:50] and bring a sacrifice and then he looks
[1:02:55] at what and it is listen I want you to I
[1:02:57] was gonna mention this the other day
[1:02:59] brother Brown preached works his faith
[1:03:02] expressed now remember just your works
[1:03:04] alone is not going to do it but if
[1:03:08] you're working or serving or are heading
[1:03:11] toward a goal of receiving the baptism
[1:03:13] the Holy Ghost it is your works because
[1:03:15] he was looking that Ruth worse he had no
[1:03:18] history on this girl at all
[1:03:20] now Naomi yet history cuz it was family
[1:03:23] like me and brother Danny were not
[1:03:25] brothers blood but I know Dale and I
[1:03:29] know Pete and his sister some but more
[1:03:32] the guys but now don't don't walk up to
[1:03:36] me and tell me say well now what did
[1:03:39] Dale do 25 years ago at so-and-so a
[1:03:42] place I go oh you're not my family
[1:03:45] go ask Danny Danny could say Dale was
[1:03:49] so-and-so fishing some 20 and he could
[1:03:51] tell you the whole story that's what I'm
[1:03:53] saying with this Sam with you and now
[1:03:54] it's not that God didn't know who you
[1:03:56] are but there was a time you were
[1:03:59] alienated amen I didn't want God to see
[1:04:03] what I did remember brother mom said
[1:04:05] there's a there's a what there's a
[1:04:06] covering of blood all around the world
[1:04:09] and he only hears your voice cuz if he
[1:04:12] sees what we done he would have killed
[1:04:14] us when we were little
[1:04:15] not little babies I'm talking about when
[1:04:17] we first started sinning he would have
[1:04:18] just said I that's it but no he didn't
[1:04:22] know who you are because you weren't
[1:04:24] part of his family but once you come
[1:04:27] into family and if he if you go ask
[1:04:30] Danny about his brother she did cuz his
[1:04:32] family they were there same way with
[1:04:35] what God was there with Israel all the
[1:04:37] way down through that Old Testament but
[1:04:40] he had to divorce her to get a Gentile
[1:04:44] bride because why she went whoring and
[1:04:47] when she went whoring she took on
[1:04:48] another husband and he couldn't take her
[1:04:50] back hey bye okay with that it's a
[1:04:53] really beautiful beautiful picture so
[1:04:57] let's go to Ruth chapter three and this
[1:04:59] is Ruth resting we may get to right here
[1:05:03] and just stop I'd like to finish it all
[1:05:06] but we won't have to we just remember
[1:05:08] what what God's telling us I wanted to
[1:05:13] read something real quick
[1:05:20] in Chapter 3 we see Boaz and Ruth
[1:05:28] finally come together so now what is the
[1:05:31] third stage of your journey it's when
[1:05:35] you and Christ come together now
[1:05:37] remember in the natural story nothing
[1:05:40] happens fleshly you gotta you got to be
[1:05:42] careful with your types they didn't
[1:05:44] become married until just a little bit
[1:05:46] at the very end of this part all right
[1:05:48] but watch what happens and I'll read to
[1:05:51] you what brother Branham talks about
[1:05:52] mm-hmm here in chapter 3 because you got
[1:05:56] it really you have to blend chapter 3
[1:05:58] and 4 together because like brother
[1:05:59] Dale's always said like like I've always
[1:06:01] said there's only three works of grapes
[1:06:03] so you can't say there's four definite
[1:06:06] words there's only three justifications
[1:06:11] think back to them talk about what you
[1:06:12] do after that is that fourth stage it's
[1:06:16] the stage so what am I saying that Ruth
[1:06:18] three and four chapter both kind of
[1:06:20] blends together but you got to have
[1:06:23] three first you got to have Boaz doing
[1:06:26] the work of a kinsman at the end of the
[1:06:31] chapter after what she does and I love
[1:06:34] this what she does here I got we got to
[1:06:36] get into it so look then Naomi her
[1:06:38] mother-in-law said unto her my daughter
[1:06:40] so what because what do we do maybe I
[1:06:41] just told you in first Corinthians we
[1:06:43] look back at the Old Testament and see
[1:06:45] types we look back in the Old Testament
[1:06:47] the old mother Naomi we look back toward
[1:06:50] Naomi and get our types to tell us how
[1:06:53] to deal with things to tell us how to
[1:06:55] live
[1:06:56] the ten commandments are in the Old
[1:06:58] Testament the woman's folks not wear
[1:07:01] pants is in the Old Testament but y'all
[1:07:04] be careful when you tell people that
[1:07:05] unless y'all I send the Old Testament
[1:07:07] say well 10 commandments is - you'll
[1:07:09] just do away with the hell you want to
[1:07:11] do away if yours won't do away with the
[1:07:12] Old Testament do all of it that's why I
[1:07:15] always try to trap them I'll if you
[1:07:17] start your conversation say look you
[1:07:19] know me you say do you believe in the
[1:07:22] Ten Commandments oh yeah you ever
[1:07:23] Christians go so I believe in the Ten
[1:07:25] Commandments I put them out there
[1:07:26] my lawn I guess and I them ten
[1:07:28] commandments there at the voice of God
[1:07:30] and you just really lay it in and then
[1:07:32] say and what about Deuteronomy 29 says a
[1:07:34] woman's not supposed to wear a garment
[1:07:36] pertain to man they show all that first
[1:07:37] thing they'll say well that's in the Old
[1:07:39] Testament and I'll go let's go back
[1:07:44] about five minutes you so we're gonna do
[1:07:46] away with a whole Old Testament there's
[1:07:49] where your Ten Commandments is that so
[1:07:52] anyway just just comment you kept a at
[1:07:55] least you get them to thinking but the
[1:08:00] Old Testament to me is all the beautiful
[1:08:02] tops because when you get in the New
[1:08:03] Testament it's us it's Jesus bringing
[1:08:08] forth my brother Dale so you got John
[1:08:12] coming at the end of the Old Testament
[1:08:14] turn introduce Christ and he was the
[1:08:19] third coming of Elijah then we've had
[1:08:21] the forthcoming of Elijah come to do
[1:08:24] what introduced Christ through us to the
[1:08:29] world so the same type just keeps on
[1:08:32] going
[1:08:33] then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[1:08:35] her my daughter shall I not seek rest
[1:08:38] for thee that it may be well with thee
[1:08:40] now look and now is not Boaz of our
[1:08:44] kindred to watch Naomi all the types and
[1:08:47] shadows and all the things in the Old
[1:08:49] Testament the sacrifices and I'm just
[1:08:52] saying this now not with that but you
[1:08:53] you know what Naomi's not thinking that
[1:08:55] but this is what we can think now that
[1:08:57] Naomi is going hey we've got this rich
[1:08:59] heritage and I've been separated from it
[1:09:05] right Naomi's husband was dead she had
[1:09:08] to sell everything she had Ruth could
[1:09:11] not connect her back at that point
[1:09:14] because Ruth had no we listen we as
[1:09:17] Gentiles had nothing we don't have a
[1:09:20] promise but Naomi does so naomi has to
[1:09:27] say look Boaz is our link here and now
[1:09:33] it's not Boaz of our kindred with whose
[1:09:37] matings now us in other words out in the
[1:09:39] field be
[1:09:40] hold he win with barley tonight in the
[1:09:43] threshing-floor I love what brother
[1:09:46] Brown said brother Brown said look
[1:09:48] Christ is what the Lord of the harvest
[1:09:50] and when you go to winnow it's in it's
[1:09:54] in one of these quotes I'll read it
[1:09:55] maybe well I'll stop here after this and
[1:09:57] we'll redo it next Sunday and we'll go
[1:10:00] back on some of these quotes he said
[1:10:02] there Boaz was he wasn't just Lord of
[1:10:04] the harvest he was laying on top of the
[1:10:07] whole harvest cousin he comes to a place
[1:10:10] he lays down on the threshing floor he
[1:10:13] probably been working for listen he's
[1:10:15] been working for 6,000 years you know
[1:10:19] he's been working but yeah brother Brown
[1:10:23] says is there said Naomi walk say I mean
[1:10:26] Ruth walks in and there the Lord of the
[1:10:28] harvest is laying on the whole harvest
[1:10:29] in other words he's up on top of the
[1:10:31] heap he's up on top of the heap he's got
[1:10:35] it all covered and it looks like a bad
[1:10:38] thing that Naomi's going to do but it's
[1:10:40] the most perfect
[1:10:41] I mean Ruth that's the most perfect
[1:10:43] thing that Ruth could have done because
[1:10:46] watch your types we'll get to this real
[1:10:47] quick and we'll stop right here and now
[1:10:49] it's not mobile as of our kindred with
[1:10:51] whose maiden that was behold he went on
[1:10:54] with barley tonight in the threshing
[1:10:56] floor washed ourselves therefore in
[1:11:01] other words come on God get yourself
[1:11:03] clean you've come in through
[1:11:05] sanctification you're coming back to the
[1:11:07] end of sanctification you get ready to
[1:11:08] rest you're getting ready to let Boaz
[1:11:10] you're getting ready to let the man do
[1:11:11] the job but you still got to be clean
[1:11:14] wash thyself there for an anoint they
[1:11:17] whoa and put our raiment upon thee in
[1:11:20] other words don't go in there with a
[1:11:22] bunch of rags on but make not thyself
[1:11:25] known unto the man until he shall have
[1:11:28] done eating and drinking in other words
[1:11:31] he's going to be strong he's gonna have
[1:11:36] eat he's not gonna be hungry he's gonna
[1:11:39] have drunk drink and it shall be when he
[1:11:42] lies down this where brother Aaron says
[1:11:44] he lies down right on top of the whole
[1:11:45] heap of the harvest because he's the
[1:11:47] lord of the harvest that thou shalt mark
[1:11:49] the place where he shall lie and thou
[1:11:53] shalt go in
[1:11:53] and uncover his feet and lay thee down
[1:11:56] and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
[1:12:02] and she said unto her ain't doing that I
[1:12:08] ain't going into no abandon and lay down
[1:12:10] at his feet his feet probably stinks
[1:12:13] you're telling me to clean up you see
[1:12:15] what I'm talking about she had to write
[1:12:17] at it to you she said whatever all the
[1:12:23] types in the Old Testament all the
[1:12:25] shadows all the sacrifices all of what
[1:12:28] we're talking about today she went down
[1:12:30] she said all that thou sayeth unto me I
[1:12:34] will do amen
[1:12:40] can you say that all that you've said to
[1:12:44] me Lord Old Testament New Testament up
[1:12:46] to this day will you be able to do what
[1:12:51] I'm telling you to do how about that
[1:12:54] brother Brent says he's laying on the
[1:12:57] whole heap of the harvest now watch
[1:13:01] where she goes she goes and lays down
[1:13:02] his his feet now she's not ready to
[1:13:04] marry him yet get the story she's not
[1:13:08] laying up there where he's that
[1:13:09] everybody understand when I'm home out I
[1:13:11] know we're all men and here you
[1:13:12] understand she's not she go get into bed
[1:13:14] with him
[1:13:16] watch her position her position is
[1:13:19] humility to lay at a man's feet delay at
[1:13:23] anybody's feet its humility she shows
[1:13:26] humility she went down into the floor
[1:13:29] and did according to all that her
[1:13:32] mother-in-law bathed her in other words
[1:13:34] she did all the ten commandments she did
[1:13:36] all the things that that the old Jewish
[1:13:38] mother told her when Boaz had eaten and
[1:13:40] drunk and his heart was married he went
[1:13:42] to lie down at the end of the heap of
[1:13:44] corn and she came softly and uncovered
[1:13:47] his feet and laid her down now look she
[1:13:54] wasn't ashamed to do this and he came to
[1:13:57] pass at midnight brother Graham said it
[1:14:00] was a dark hour that the man was afraid
[1:14:03] now this is the natural story of Boaz
[1:14:04] because you didn't know who she was it
[1:14:06] stung and behold a woman lay
[1:14:07] his feet and he said who aren't thou and
[1:14:09] she answered I am Ruth on handmade
[1:14:12] spread therefore thy skirt over thy head
[1:14:15] and handmade for thou art a near kinsman
[1:14:17] so what's going through Boaz's mind
[1:14:21] there's a connection here even in the
[1:14:25] natural story Boaz is like there's a
[1:14:27] connection here why is she here and not
[1:14:30] Naomi what's she doing here
[1:14:33] and not Naomi because Naomi's who I'm
[1:14:36] kin to but brother brown said he was so
[1:14:39] in love with her till he took I'm gonna
[1:14:45] paraphrase it here he through the holy
[1:14:49] spirit veil over her till he said
[1:14:54] blessed be the Lord my daughter for thou
[1:14:56] has showed more kindness in the latter
[1:14:57] in latter day then at the beginning as
[1:15:00] much as thou follow us not young men
[1:15:02] where they're poor or rich now my
[1:15:05] daughter fear not now what's the first
[1:15:07] thing Jesus says when he comes fear not
[1:15:10] fear not I'm come to do this I will do
[1:15:14] to the all that thou requested for all
[1:15:16] the city of my people don't know that
[1:15:18] they now look in your Christian journey
[1:15:21] that's why God's going to give you the
[1:15:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost because look
[1:15:24] the whole community knows that you've
[1:15:27] changed the whole community knows that
[1:15:30] thou art a virtuous woman and now it is
[1:15:32] true that I am thine near kinsman
[1:15:33] howbeit there's the kinsman near to uh
[1:15:36] teri this night and it shall be in the
[1:15:39] more in other words he's saying look you
[1:15:41] rest you stay right here because you
[1:15:43] can't do anything about it you have no
[1:15:45] connection I have the connection now I'm
[1:15:49] going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
[1:15:52] take Naomi's possession but let me tell
[1:15:55] you something sweetheart Naomi's not
[1:15:59] going to be my bride you are because I
[1:16:03] put this Holy Ghost veil over you and
[1:16:04] you've what your pure your virtuous
[1:16:06] brother Bryan tells us that we're what
[1:16:08] the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus
[1:16:12] Christ why because he's put that Holy
[1:16:14] Ghost veil over her and listen what this
[1:16:20] feat me
[1:16:21] brother Brahim tells us in about six or
[1:16:23] eight quotes feet means possession now
[1:16:29] you say where you going with that I'll
[1:16:30] go with that and then we're gonna stop I
[1:16:32] said it stop right here 6:30 so he's
[1:16:34] gonna do the part of the kinsman do you
[1:16:39] ever thought of this
[1:16:41] if footprints means possession he told
[1:16:46] Abraham wherever you sold your feet
[1:16:47] that's where you you will possess this
[1:16:49] land even God tells us in the New
[1:16:52] Testament I believe it's in Corinthians
[1:16:54] that blessed are the feet of the ones
[1:16:57] that carry the gospel so it's always the
[1:16:59] remember we preach that long time ago
[1:17:01] about washing the feet Jesus said you
[1:17:03] don't have no problem if you don't wash
[1:17:04] feet that's pretty strong but you know
[1:17:06] why I'm just telling you what God said
[1:17:07] if you don't wash feet then you got a
[1:17:09] problem you can't be a servant and not
[1:17:13] be a servant you can't have Jesus Christ
[1:17:15] in your life because you become a
[1:17:16] servant then so watch what this is what
[1:17:21] did Jesus do when he was taken into
[1:17:25] Pylos Hall I was thinking about this
[1:17:27] just a few minutes ago think about this
[1:17:30] this is the king of the harvest this is
[1:17:32] the Lord of the whole earth this is the
[1:17:34] guy that gold doesn't mean anything to
[1:17:36] him it's pavement but he had to come
[1:17:39] down in human flesh and be made what
[1:17:41] into a servant he had to be made into a
[1:17:43] human being so that he could take what
[1:17:45] he couldn't take our place as a son of
[1:17:47] God he couldn't take our place that
[1:17:49] spirit God he had to become his brother
[1:17:51] Dale something he had to become human
[1:17:52] flesh you know what he had he had human
[1:17:55] feet but those human feet contained God
[1:17:59] so what happened in pilots Hall they
[1:18:03] stripped that man of all of his clothes
[1:18:06] except for a loin cloth so there was
[1:18:08] this bare feet and as he walked up
[1:18:11] Gaga's toe this is mine he walks up they
[1:18:18] put him on a cross his feet was lifted
[1:18:21] up off the earth but he had walked his
[1:18:23] little feet had walked right up to that
[1:18:24] cross in turn not dragging not pulling
[1:18:28] not stomping he walked right up there
[1:18:31] and he laid down on that cross and is
[1:18:34] we're gonna see next Sunday
[1:18:35] where's lifted up his shoe and he said I
[1:18:39] have redeemed and then listen to this
[1:18:42] that man died on the cross for me and
[1:18:45] you he's blessed feet never touched the
[1:18:47] ground until the day of the resurrection
[1:18:51] then he gets out and he stands up in
[1:18:54] that term and he says now this is mine
[1:18:56] I've conquered death my feet go all the
[1:19:00] way up that hill they carried me and put
[1:19:04] me in a tomb but that can't hold me cuz
[1:19:07] when I turned myself off of this slap
[1:19:10] that I'm laying on my feet he's gonna
[1:19:13] touch the grave and now remember what he
[1:19:17] says when he steps out he says all power
[1:19:19] in heaven and earth has been given unto
[1:19:22] me because my feet walked up that
[1:19:27] mountain they drove nails through it but
[1:19:31] now I'm gonna walk out of this tomb so I
[1:19:33] take death and hell even this poor
[1:19:38] little bear feet went to hell remember
[1:19:40] he went to hell went the hell walk then
[1:19:43] brother brems he walked in hell said hey
[1:19:45] give me the key
[1:19:46] what a great Boaz we got that's why Boaz
[1:19:50] had to take that shoe off because that
[1:19:51] was possession he bought everything that
[1:19:54] Naomi had lost and in doing that he got
[1:19:59] his beautiful Gentile bride let's stand
[1:20:04] to our feet we'll talk about we'll kind
[1:20:09] of cover this again next Sunday and
[1:20:11] we'll read some more quotes but God
[1:20:13] bless you that to me is one of the
[1:20:14] prettiest stories of my Redemption I
[1:20:18] don't know about yours you need to look
[1:20:21] at this for yourself
[1:20:22] and you see that that that's why that
[1:20:30] that man
[1:20:32] that's why that Ruth had to lay down at
[1:20:35] his feet because she laid everything she
[1:20:38] had knowing that that man was going to
[1:20:42] get up and walk into that town and
[1:20:45] remember when you see this type we'll
[1:20:48] see it next Sunday
[1:20:49] Boaz didn't claim Redemption in the city
[1:20:53] remember Jesus was crucified outside the
[1:20:57] city
[1:20:57] Boaz walks up to the gate of the city
[1:21:03] what the Bible say it will possess the
[1:21:07] gates Abraham your royal seed of Abraham
[1:21:13] will possess the gates of the enemy
[1:21:16] Boaz walks up and takes his shoe off and
[1:21:18] he stands there in his bare feet and he
[1:21:20] says I have done it okay nobody else do
[1:21:23] it there's a guy here but he don't want
[1:21:24] nothing to do with him while reading
[1:21:25] what brother Branham says about that a
[1:21:27] little bit later on next week but Ruth
[1:21:31] deciding justification Ruth serving
[1:21:35] sanctification and then God and the type
[1:21:39] of the baptism of Holy Ghost she can't
[1:21:40] get it herself she has to lay down and
[1:21:42] show her humility and brother Branham
[1:21:45] says God just throws that Holy Ghost
[1:21:47] veil over the top of her and says you
[1:21:49] just hang on right there I got to go do
[1:21:51] a work for you because you can't get the
[1:21:54] Holy Ghost for yourself I've got to be
[1:21:56] here to give it to you so god bless you
[1:21:58] just read if you want to reap keep
[1:22:00] reading The Book of Ruth and read the
[1:22:02] kinsman-redeemer 1960 if you'll read
[1:22:04] that whole read that whole sermon it'll
[1:22:08] really tell you a little bit more than
[1:22:09] what we covered but thank God that the
[1:22:12] Lord give the inspiration to put that in
[1:22:16] the Bible cuz it was just a regular book
[1:22:18] come in though I don't even think they
[1:22:19] know who wrote it Ruth didn't write it
[1:22:21] somebody else wrote it but they said hey
[1:22:23] this is an inspiration and then by the
[1:22:25] inspiration of the Holy Ghost you and I
[1:22:27] can see now that it totally tops all
[1:22:29] four characters is everybody we see the
[1:22:33] denominational Church going back to the
[1:22:34] denominations the Gentile bride
[1:22:36] Boaz Ben Christ and Naomi be in that
[1:22:40] church over there are that why I say the
[1:22:44] ortho
[1:22:45] Church the Jewish Church the God's not
[1:22:47] gonna forget he's going right through us
[1:22:49] taking a bride gonna have a child and
[1:22:51] we're gonna deliver that child right to
[1:22:53] back to Naomi she's gonna realize though
[1:22:57] that that child's are when they died for
[1:22:59] and through not through us personally
[1:23:03] but through the bride because we're
[1:23:06] virtuous and all these things that God
[1:23:09] said about route that Boaz said about
[1:23:11] Ruth Naomi Naomi the old church is gonna
[1:23:14] look back and say all that was a
[1:23:16] virtuous woman and now my Boaz has
[1:23:19] showed up to take a hundred and forty
[1:23:22] four thousand of us as he promised us in
[1:23:25] the Testaments he promised so now here
[1:23:28] he is oh what a time a lot of time
[1:23:31] they're gonna cry and screaming and
[1:23:32] they're gonna just have a like oh how
[1:23:34] would you believe a man so let's sing a
[1:23:36] song god bless you god bless you sitting

[1:24:18] all I'm gonna do is love him love is
[1:24:25] whole leaning again do is love is love
[1:24:40] yeah a llama she got my wings yet why
[1:24:44] don't why don't easily have to wait

[1:24:58] lord will praise Him I know I'll never
[1:25:03] be the same all I want to do it's love
[1:25:12] love his whole think about all those
[1:25:19] types all I want to do
[1:25:22] there was a lady named Ruth in the Bible
[1:25:25] several thousand years ago then she
[1:25:28] perfectly ties
[1:25:30] what we're going through what Abram went
[1:25:32] to be changed Abraham ruling through the
[1:25:35] same stages and remember at the end
[1:25:38] there's always a real there's always
[1:25:41] that reward and that's what we're
[1:25:43] looking at we're looking at a reward
[1:25:45] going up that statue of a perfect man oh
[1:25:48] we got born again right here amen
[1:25:51] but look at all that this that's this
[1:25:54] extra look at all that that's mine and
[1:25:59] yours
[1:26:00] that's what Ruth gets don't remember
[1:26:04] when she managed Boaz
[1:26:06] she got everything bow has God she was
[1:26:10] right there in line and then that baby
[1:26:12] they had was named old bad old bad had
[1:26:16] Jesse Jesse turns around and has David
[1:26:19] and then that lineage continues right on
[1:26:22] down the natural lineage to Christ so
[1:26:25] boy what a story I say I'd love to been
[1:26:28] there but you know what if I'd have been
[1:26:29] standing there if I'd have been standing
[1:26:32] there roofs time I probably wouldn't
[1:26:33] understood what was going on but I got
[1:26:36] the full story now we can take all four
[1:26:39] chapters that could have had that I
[1:26:41] think it was 10 or 11 years is what the
[1:26:43] usher said that covers this whole time
[1:26:45] well we've covered it in about an hour
[1:26:47] so and we gleaned so much more we got
[1:26:52] some handfuls of purpose oh I won't
[1:26:54] buckets full I don't want to get just a
[1:26:57] little handful I want to be where I can
[1:26:59] carry it
[1:27:00] and we're gonna get into next Sunday
[1:27:02] where she
[1:27:02] six measures she gets a six fold purpose
[1:27:09] so we'll get into that next Sunday god
[1:27:12] bless you love you with the love of the
[1:27:14] Lord all minds are clear thank you for
[1:27:17] all coming like I said before now just
[1:27:19] all the men if you you don't need to get
[1:27:21] a phone call from me but all the men
[1:27:22] wants to come from now on that would be
[1:27:25] fine just make sure we keep just stay
[1:27:28] away from each other we can't do that
[1:27:31] that much but yeah
[1:27:32] we can do that now I believe and stay in
[1:27:34] the sanctuary and then whatever the
[1:27:37] we'll look around the community and just
[1:27:40] pray you pray that that brother Dale
[1:27:42] myself and anybody that has a suggestion
[1:27:45] we'd love to hear it but but we need to
[1:27:47] keep this thing in a good balance so
[1:27:50] that we don't become we don't draw
[1:27:53] attention to us because we still listen
[1:27:56] Jesus told them said give under Caesar
[1:27:59] what Caesars so we're giving God's once
[1:28:02] God today we giving Caesar what Caesar
[1:28:04] is out there so we just want to be safe
[1:28:07] and we don't want to give the devil any
[1:28:09] time to play okay but I anybody that
[1:28:12] wants to come the two services or Sunday
[1:28:15] and Wednesday but it still holds true on
[1:28:17] Sunday I'm like brother Dale can't come
[1:28:19] to both services need let me know I'll
[1:28:20] if somebody else wants to come but if
[1:28:23] all the men will come go ahead and come
[1:28:26] now I do ask you one thing I forgot this
[1:28:29] like if brother Colley is listening in
[1:28:32] or brother dartie or any ones that are
[1:28:34] that are older like that I will if
[1:28:37] you're gonna come I don't mind you
[1:28:38] coming but wear a mask wear a mask
[1:28:41] if you do come all right just to protect
[1:28:44] everything that we do if not I don't
[1:28:48] want to disclose the older crowd but we
[1:28:51] got one over here that's the oldest man
[1:28:54] in the building so I think since brother
[1:28:57] dick passed away you're the oldest one
[1:28:59] period
[1:29:01] besides the sister we got a couple of
[1:29:04] sisters so but you know the Lord the
[1:29:06] Lord's gonna keep us all safe I believe
[1:29:08] but don't go run out there in the middle
[1:29:09] of the road don't go right out in front
[1:29:11] of the tractor-trailer it be your time
[1:29:13] and you and you made it
[1:29:16] right so that's just it bro Danny's
[1:29:18] always this is nothing new to brother
[1:29:20] Danny I before since he got sick back
[1:29:22] years ago and fell off the chicken house
[1:29:24] he's washed his hands that Joker washing
[1:29:26] his hands when he washed his hands he
[1:29:28] would keep washing his hands I can't do
[1:29:30] it for 20s that's the longest 20 seconds
[1:29:32] in the world they tell you now to wash
[1:29:34] your hands for 20 seconds Oh Lord
[1:29:36] I think two seconds is about all I get
[1:29:41] you know but 20 seconds but brother
[1:29:43] Danny's always done it you always had
[1:29:44] hand sanitizer so he he's kind of used
[1:29:47] to it but let's all do that do the right
[1:29:49] thing and pray pray every day that God
[1:29:54] give us wisdom in all this okay all
