REVELATION OF JUST. SANT. HOLY GHOST

II PETER 1:4-12
»     4     †     Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 
»     5     †      ¶  And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
»     6     †     And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
»     7     †     And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
»     8     †     For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
»     9     †     But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
»     10     †     Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: 
»     11     †     For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
»     12     †      ¶  Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.

«  E-24       †        And now, this epistle, the letter to the Ephesians, was written to believers, not to the outside world. This is believers. That's why I thought this afternoon first I'd test and see if there's groups of unbelievers, and sinners, then I couldn't speak this here. But now, seeing that it is for the believers, and the believers are present, I thought it would be good if we let the believer see where he is. Now, try hard, Christians, to understand that this day, that ...

stand before in the precious name of jesus we have the victory amen let's give god a handclap of praise he's worthy when i woke up this morning did you have a doubt i didn't have a doubt i knew the lord was going to work it out problem is we try to work it out and then we want the lord to fix our mess that we made remember he don't make messes amen i was thinking when the brothers and sisters were singing up here wow what a powerful song but you know there's different kinds of fire though there's a consuming fire there's a fire that went on that burned a bush and didn't burn it up there's a fire that's going to burn after this world's over with in another dimension and the fifth dimension that kind of fire but there's a fire of god there's a holy fire that'll clean out your building if you'll let it and just like the three hebrew children i think about that a lot about the new birth there's three there's three hebrew children justification sanctification baptism and holy ghost they got thrown in a fire when they come out they didn't even smell like smoke it wasn't like that they were just i know they were odd that the people didn't get burnt up but they're like you don't even smell that they don't smell of the world in you anymore they ain't no smell of the world on you anymore because there was a fourth man in the fire hey man if it wasn't for that fourth man in the fire they would have been burned up think about that think of what a miracle talk about a body change that was just a precursor to what we're coming to but they come to they had god had to change their their body just for a moment though and then they came back and then they died but we're gonna get a body change we're not gonna ever die amen good to be in the house of the lord good to have you all back with us good to be alive good to be well um i want to make an announcement before i make the announcements i've been praying yeah i'm going to anyway um i've been praying about a certain time something to do this and i i want to lay it before you and uh get your opinion on it uh you know we got that new baptistery and this at the house and we need to put it together and use it um kind of make a run before we before we really do need it and find out there's something wrong with it so on may the 15th that will be sunday may the 15th i think we're just going to have a rededication service vow renewal rededication of the church and then have a baptismal service afterwards we're going to fill the pool up if you want to be re-baptized it'll be ready to go if you don't then we'll still i want to fill that thing up and and get all the bugs worked out of it before we have to have somebody comes up and says i want to really be baptized you know i want to get to get and i don't mean being frivolous is you just we're going to baptize people because we're going to try the pool out no some people need a rededication we've re-baptized people several several times but if your conscience is not clear then let's be re-baptized but let's have a rededication service on may the 15th if that's all right you all continue to pray well like i said we'll have vow renewals we'll have rededication of deacons ministers all the department heads will all come around brother dale can come and we can pray for him pray over you and just have a rededication service only have one service that day because if we do go to the pool we don't want to have another service and people be wet so we'll just have one service we'll have maybe some extra singing that morning and then we'll have a baptismal service and a rededication service and we'll speak maybe a little bit on rededicating the temple or anointing the temple if that's all right with everybody amen may the 15th so just just keep in your prayer we may change it if somebody's not here but if everybody's here uh we'll do that on may the 15th that's i think that's the third sunday in may it's right before the uh it's right before the uh kids are the youth service on may the 21st where brother kid ray dig so just keep that in your prayer and let's uh let's rededicate ourselves it's just kind of time we just rededicate ourselves and rededicate ourselves to the lord and uh and die die daily paul said yes sir brother may the 15th the weekend before no i mean the weekend before we have our youth i have our youth service okay all right well we may do it the week before that anybody have a problem with that thanks for telling me that though that's why i said i wanted to throw it out there and let you oh that's right we won't be here i'm not going to be here let's do it anyway me and luis is going to be gone so invite brother joel to come down here while i'm up there but um okay well then we may do it the week after that but sometime in may i'd like to do that if you don't mind we can get the pool set up and uh and i'd like to uh sure enough have a rededication service anyway and rededicate ourselves to the lord heading into summertime and and shake all the shake all the wintertime blues off and and do a little house cleaning amen so let's go to john 1 verse 1 remember brother brother aaron will be speaking for us this wednesday night may the 7th we'll have bible study and we're still talking a little bit we covered the rapture some if anybody has any questions on the rapture and then also in the millennium and we will be doing a zoom meeting i think they've got some more equipment set up where's richard he's in the back we've got some more equipment set up where we can do it better we can hear better they can hear better and some of you if you can't come on saturday night you can do it from your house so just get with brother richard or brother joe or brother um andrew thank you anderson and um maybe brother bob but that to get those technical things out of the way if you want to zoom from your home you want to zoom from home okay okay yeah yes yeah everybody's seeing that part yes yes well that that was uh joe put that online on our website on the spoken word website yeah but the zoom me if you anybody that if you've got an e we've got the account and we're using somebody's account and i think we ought to be getting our own but um it's just a small fee that you pay i think for the year right we already have it okay all right i knew we were discussing that so i'm sorry to keep you standing but we get all these things out of the way and then y'all go to sleep but um well if you listen now but we'll do that and um and anybody can get on if if janice anybody want anybody across the country can get on right if we're putting it on zoom if you share the link right okay so if you need us to do that you need to let us know um we just have regular discussion y'all know most you have been there but the the group from ohio um i wanted to get them involved with it too and and they were really involved last time and um like i said i get a lot more sometimes out of that two hours than i do out of a out of a sermon because you're sitting there asking questions and you can stop and say hey i need you to explain what you just said all right so i enjoy that i think brother dale started this a long time ago bible study long 20 years ago or more and it helped us more than i believe it's a church has helped us more than than anything any one single thing has helped us it's a bible study hey ma'am so let's read i'll announce all this other stuff about the fishing trip now a little bit later but remember second service we're having cake and ice cream for brother richard if you have anything for brother dale um you can give it to him at that time so let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us i pray that you just be with us in this service sanctify us for this journey lord we're human beings and we're trying our best to do what we can to help the people lord and the people are responding lord with with being able to help and all the things like last weekend lord we all kind of pitched in together and everybody did their job and i pray lord that's the way it should be in the word that we to be a body of christ it's not just waiting on tables and making sure food but lord make sure we're ready make sure that we're sanctified for this journey lord make sure that we're justified make sure that the things of the world have been cleared away from us and that we can hear from you lord because that's the most important thing is to hear from you we have all these different events but if you're not the center of that event lord then it's just not worth it lord i pray this should be with us now keep us safe be the ones that are sick be with the ones that are on the highways brother joe and sister rachel and them on vacation lord and you got brother john duret heading back home we pray that you just give them travel and mercy father just bless us now take care of us and furthermore this service in jesus name we pray amen i want to give the song leaders an accolade let's give them a big hand and the musician from this past weekend y'all worked a long time sister christine and and and sister trudy and and little zoe she ain't little no more what a piano player i told her i said i'd have you stand up and recognize you but you can't get she couldn't we'd have to get her a baby grand piano before that she'd stand up and she will still couldn't see her but we can see her now everybody knows who zoe is but she's she's using her talent at nine years old nine ten for the glory of the lord wow what if we'd all started yeah what if we'd all started 10 years old giving our ourself to the lord think about that but we had to have a journey though we all had to have a journey we had to have a testimony so john 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and we're reading this morning in romans 8 verse 18 says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and i'll read you a quote a little bit later why it's to be revealed in us because it's the only way god's going to be revealed in the end time it's the only way god's going to be revealed is in his bride in his body the movement when he was on earth i was thinking about this yesterday when jesus christ was on earth that was he was in his body his earthly human body but now that earthly human body stayed under subjection to that soul that was inside of him what about me and you for the body of christ we need to stay under the subjection just like his body stayed under subjection and he abstained from things he was supposed to abstain from it did what was inside the control room was telling that man what to do and he was perfect and i read a scripture this morning i thought that says something about heirs and joy and errors did we not cover that oh okay all right that's why i want to that's why that i want us to see as we're as we've been speaking on the son of man that we've we've separated him out to be in the son of man and tell him what his characteristics are and all these but we need to pull that thing back together that we're now the son of man in the end time we're now the body of christ the only body that christ has is on the earth at this time in a many membered body just like you have many parts we have you know kidneys liver heart lungs and all those things they all fingers toes and all those different parts that are used to complete our body but it's all controlled by one thing the head one thing's controlled by the head the head controls everything i do that's why men they can't make they make a computer that's pretty fast but they never can make a computer that's that as fast as a human brain can't do it i don't you know this artificial intelligence that thinks before you do no that thing ain't got a god inside of it we got a god inside of us that can think faster than anything man can produce amen and we thank god for that and he designed every human being for that it's just if you decided you want to give it to god or decide you want to give it to the devil that's your priority and your prerogative all right so who is this son of man i hope i'm part third this is part 32 i hope you realize who you are you are this son of man that's my question i want to ask you who is this son of man in the beginning was the word word with god the word was god and the word was made flesh in me and you amen the prophet of god said we're supposed to be a moving living moving instrumentality of god we got to get to that to take a body change so that's what we're looking at we're heading toward a body changing and you know the a few questions were asked and and the good questions and the question was was if you won't mind bring that chart up over there on this on this side over here brothers and i apologize if i was a little quick this morning by wondering where that chart was because they couldn't find it now they found it i once was lost but now i'm found but the question kind of was well what if what if you you know what if the rapture takes place and and you're not at the headstone well i i i want to cover it later on but you'll have to die physically it's not my words you'll have to pass away that's what i mean that that we're facing we're facing either a body change or we're facing death because of unbelief i read the scripture this morning we'll read it again because of unbelief or you never were born again to start with is that right that's the three things you're either you're either born again and you're going to make it to the headstone the word of god is going to be in you just like it was in jesus christ in his fullness or you're going to have to pass away and go by the grave because you can't come to this headstone revelation you get quiet if you want to but that's the truth we're looking at this death right here if we don't make a body change because you can't come you can't the day of the rapture you can't be born again you hear me and not and your body not change well what if i die well yeah when you raise up your body is going to change but remember what brother brown said death does death is a vehicle to take you to god but remember too that's not in my sermon but we'll go this way what's going to happen now listen if you're if you're a foolish virgin you're going to have to give your life you didn't get the new birth you do not have the new birth in your soul if your foolish virgin and you will be left behind you will not make the rapture does everybody got that all the the only people that go into rapture are people that are born again in their soul everybody with me now that's we taught that for 50 years so um that should be elementary that's the principles of the doctrines of christ that i'm telling you about now so you must be born again to be born again you will go in the rapture but that doesn't guarantee your body change without dying now brother branham even tells us foolish virgins have to go through the millen through the sorry not the millennium that's not right go through the tribulation they'll have to physically die because brother brown said they didn't go all the way because what cleans you up the new birth is what cleans you up it cleans your body spirit and soul everybody with me all right so if you got the new birth today potentially those who is justified he's already glorified but now that doesn't mean that you're going to automatically take a body change no you got to come to a place to where brother brown said death will go up your sleeve and you'll just wipe it right off amen you say that's unbelievable well we'll see you in the rapture because we'll be doing your funeral and there's no there's no disgrace in that either because you're born again child of god you're going to make it if you're born again today you're going in a rapture it doesn't matter satan can't take it away from you god can't even take it away from you amen so you're going in the rapture but you may have to pass on because you come to a place you don't not that you don't want to believe anymore but let me just be real can i be real this is just home folks people sitting in churches that do not preach a headstone message will not make it to the bodies will not make it can't make it number one you know what happens the preacher stands in the pulpit and says well we're just going to take a rapture i don't know about all this but i i don't know if you get all that stuff and i don't know about this daniel 70 weeks and ah seals is for the jews and daniel said to easter for the jews and they just make it all it's all frivolous to them and they just keep on preaching their little sugar tit doctrines i'm sorry a little milk god sent a prophet we need to shout we need speaking tongues we need prayer lines sorry it takes the meat of the word paul said to make it it takes the meat of the word to make i'm going to read it to you right here in hebrews but that's just i'm sorry if you don't like that then you need to go find you somebody that preaches a sugar tit doctrine and i ain't saying that thank you brother colleen he said hey man he's been here longer most about anybody's been here except brothers already so he realizes you go listen to all these other folks i really don't care listen to them all you want to but i'm like brother dale and we're just home folks he said if there's somebody preaching any better than what's preaching in this church we need to listen to that person and let's go find them a progression a progressive message one that'll take you from the these people don't even preach on the statue of perfect man is that am i correct aaron raises his hand he raised his hand i think some people in this message don't even know what the statue of a perfect man is it's just a message in a in a string of 1100 sermons that's right daniel 17 weeks oh it's too confusing seals uh don't need that yeah you do you're not reading the same message i am but we'll read that in just a minute i don't want to be hard i know sometimes people look at you i wish you'd go somewhere else if you think there is something else because you're hindering us i'm sorry i did again i did it again i'm sorry luisa can't you wait till the end of the service to beat people over the head i said no yes i'm sorry no i re but listen when are we going to stand up like jesus did and say truth is true if you can get it from the pharisees and sadducees you need to go over there that's what jesus said isn't it but he said they are of you the fat of the devil and i am god now who said that who said that said a man can i read romans 8 one more time where heirs and see what i mean we've got it separated oh he can say that but we can't well i thought he's trying to put this thing back together again not separated lord i pray that they be one as you and i are one that ain't a bunch of people running around time to get in or get out time to go for it all and just jump and dive in if you don't understand it that's okay but i'll promise you one thing you can't have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul and god confuse you can i say that one more time if you have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul god cannot and will not put your play in a place where you're confused but now if you don't have the new birth you're confused already you're just confused you don't understand the principles of god you don't understand god because what he's not in your soul the only way the only way you can understand god is to have that that that um he's not complex but he's you can't understand him the reason we can understand him is is that i he is now inside of me and he's working his way out it's like i've always said you said you if you got the holy ghost and you read the word of god and you read the prophet's message it's just a rebound it's god talking to itself in individuals call bride and if you're confused maybe you need to get the new birth you might be confused but you won't stay confused if you get the holy ghost that's the only reason brother louise said i know i got the holy ghost the only reason i never had a sensation i never shouted never spoke in tongues but i know one time in kentucky when i said god i don't understand all this you're going to have to understand it for me and he said i'll just put me inside of you and then i'll help you understand because now having the mind of christ you ought to be able to understand what christ said so from that point forward brother aaron the word started opening up things started going fitting together i knew how serpent seed wasn't just sex in the garden it comes all the way down to here and we see it every day i'll read you some of these things in just a few minutes what a privileged people we are but brothers let's go all the way back to we're going to start at hebrews 3 again we'll cut through some of that we know that teaching positionally places you in the church and you can never rightly be able to have faith until you know your position wow he said i got faith paul said if you've got faith to move a mountain and have not charity the new birth sounding brass tinkling symbol move mountains that's why remember that phrase that jesus spoke you okay i don't want to be too loud that phrase that jesus spoke he said if you say to this mountain there's no stipulation in there that you got to be a christian he just said if you can believe no stipulation that you had to be a born-again headstone christian no because paul then comes over and says if you if you think you've got faith to move a mountain and you can move a mountain but you don't have the new birth you're nothing sounding brass tinkling symbol that's why you see the bible tells us lord have i not lord have i not done these things in your name have i not spoken tongues have i not healed the sick raised the dead jesus said he never doubted what they did he just said depart from me because i never knew you i never had an intimate relationship with you you never got born again you took some kind of idea from a message believer a message preacher that says just believe the message and that seed's just going to pop up it's just there it is and you're done you've got all these virtues you what do you mean statue of perfect man well you know what brother brown is not the first one to preach that peter preached it that's why the prophet of god couldn't say anything outside of the bible nothing he could say was outside the bible brother branham you can make a 23rd chapter of revelations with what you have now what he had fit all the other ones what he had fit to 66 books in the bible so let's go to hebrews we were reading it this morning so let's go to hebrews 3 verse 6 and start there i tell you listen folks if they hated jesus for his doctrine what are they going to do about me and you they didn't just not like him they hated him they hated him enough to kill him because of what he was a bad guy no because he told them the truth what's going to set you free the truth and he is the truth and we are heirs and joint heirs so you know what yes we can have the truth well well i you know what it's known one of these things i can't stand well you you see it this way and i see it that way that ain't the way it's supposed to be thank you can't brother's already said can't you can't you can't be a you can't have the revelation of the son of man and preach something else no way you can think you might have the revelation you can preach something else but that's you preaching it i read i was reading this morning you know the bible talks about doctrines of devils that god will allow preachers to preach these doctrines of devils and now what confidence in them was preaching but they were quoting moses they were quoting the old testament jesus never said you're misquoting the word he said what you've done with the word is you've took it and made it a tradition and not what the bible says so you've made it of none effect and you're of your father the devil you say that to somebody sometime you've got a different day than i do wow hebrews 3 verse 6 but christ has a son over his own house whose house we are this is us this is listen this is not a pretty picture each one of you are or this each person in this building is a stature of something you need to be the stature of a perfect man or you can be the stature of the devil one of the two because he's a copycat he's going to head up a church he's going to incarnate human flesh because the son of man is going to incarnate human flesh us that's the separation the denomination should never be the son of man but satan can do all he can to get close to it that's how close it's going to be folks but christ is the son over his own house whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end end your journey wherefore as the holy ghost said today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness they failed they failed god 10 times through those 40 years you know what he said when you get in the promised land this is what i want you to do when you get in the promised land this is what i want you to do he said i may let you get by with it now but you're going to pay for it later all right you're going to pay for it later moses all the different ones when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation i think god's grieved with us too for dilly dallying around and playing around and not getting on with this thing but somebody's going to because we're going to come to an end that's what it says right here unto the end wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways wait a minute this is a congregation in the wilderness that lived under the law of moses but they did not know my ways they did not know my ways so i swear in my wrath oh we got mad they shall not enter into this rest everybody with me there's some people that's going to receive the new birth and not enter into the rest not that bob was talking about the rest here we're talking about the rest here this is a battle but there's going to come a time when this is going to seal us in and then it's going to be world outside god on the inside amen but now between that time it may be rough just like it was with the children of israel verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief wow take heed brethren paul's talking to brethren not talking to the world this is not to the world this is to christians yes so then there's a level there's a level of christianity that puts you right here the new birth everybody with me say ma'am then you've got to what grow see these shadows there's a little baby here a little bit bigger man or boy a little a man all the way up to the head so you can stop right here and yeah you're going to make it you're not going through the tribulation you're going to have all these all these wonderful things but god has got to have a group of people in the end time required predestinated to adoption predestinated to a body change predestinated to bring the promised son according to the bible so there's got to be somebody that's not different listen don't think you're different and don't think this just because we go to this church we're different you know what if you believe the doctrine in this church you will be different you will be different you will not be in the normal message camp sorry about that i never have been normal now ain't won't start you can take that any way you want to because most of you are take heed brethren unless there being any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god look but exhort one another daily while it is called today study you're not might not have to sit down and open a book but there's a lot of things i think about while i'm on my job and different things brother ryan i'll tell you my when i used to cut grass a lot what was my what was my congregation the gravely lawnmower i was driving so whatever you do during your day can you not think about god while you're doing it god has put enough intelligence in most of us to where we can do that we can mult they call it multitasking amen that's why brother dale is such a such an awesome testimony about him working a job that took two people to run when he was out and and god could still talk to him and he still had enough time to write down something on the seals because that and see you say well no brother i think the seals ought to be when you go out and lay out and you go out in the backside of a desert and you're just out there and the birds bring you food you don't have to worry about what's going on back at home your grass is not growing remember what i'm saying yeah no no in the mess of a birth in the mess of a birth it's when god shows up amen same way with me and you think man i'm going through this trial how can i do this and there's a way where there's a will there's a way all right but exhort one another daily while it's called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin hardened christians hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence beginning of our faith confidence right steadfast unto the end amen amen steadfast unto the end let's go to hebrews 5 verse 8 to 14. said though we were a son now we're going to talk about we've been talking about the son of man so here we are with the son though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that what obey him called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered why scroll up please seeing that you're dull of hearing you i'm not pointing to you but you have the choice it's not because i listen he didn't say it's cause i can't explain it right god explains something to you it's not going to be difficult satan can describe something to you and confuse the hound out of you but god cannot give you something and you be a child of god and it not connect if it don't connect there's not a birth because god's not going to do anything and not get something in return hard to be utter seeing you are dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god what are the oracles of god the commandments the bible everybody with me and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat i'm reading the bible i'm not reading somebody's opinions if i got that say amen this is not your opinion or my opinion this is god for everyone that uses milk is what unskillful that doesn't mean you don't get it it's just you don't know how to use it like i said before about here's thomas he's 10 10 10 huh 13. what happened to you well you was 10 not long ago but here's thomas he's 13 and he's got a sister back there somewhere where'd that be oh hey abby she's she'll soon be 15 in just a few days we've got do not show these girls pictures on this camera i don't want no buzzards around here 15. you got that right i'm very i'm breaking the shotgun out again 15 15 and 15. i can remember when these two couldn't hardly walk t had to carry them around everywhere they went like this they loved him for his candy they loved him because it was tea right but they're getting ready to start driving but why weren't they driving when he was holding them like this they were babies they were unskilled because they hadn't what grown up and that's what god is telling you you're unskilled everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now he didn't say i'm kicking you out of the kingdom you're just a baby and i'll deal with bait you know what he deals with babies just like we deal with babies we get out of line but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age unfortunately when they get 16 the law says they can drive the law says they can drive and they'll be legally able to drive because the law has said they have come to what full age not full age is everything but full age to drive a car i believe that's the way god is you'll come to a full age of one thing before you come to a full age of something else that's my point everybody with me don't don't fall out okay you okay if you're gonna sit up here you're gonna get it but you become it's like somebody we were talking the other day that virtual knowledge temperance patience got less it's not like you're filling it up with water and it's got to go to a certain level that one level right there and it's all right when i get all my tank full of virtue then god's going to give me knowledge he's going to work all those in together this is just for a picture so you can see that one step is from step here to step here because brother brown says if you jump way up here and not have virtue then what's he going to say he said you fall down you come down the ladder rung okay that's why god works on us different as we were talking about some are going to make it to here some are going to make it to here so i'm going to make it here but listen the bible says god wouldn't all come to repentance he wants the whole world saved and he has made a way but listen everybody the world has shut that way out it's only the people in this message that's going to come to full maturity i didn't say that the bible did strong meat belongs belongeth possession belonging strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those who by reason of use what have i been saying all year use what you got let that thing out what's inside of you let it go good or bad but please change we all need to change that's why we're heading to a body change but who have reason of use have their senses memory reason conscious affection imagination is that not your senses that you're neat that you need to work on don't work on see taste phil smelling here satan's working on that anyway he's making us what we can't see we can't hear we can't god's not so let's work on the on the realm that that god can work on that's why we need a body change that's why it's got to work its way out it's got to have something inside that's eternal to begin to work out to make you outside eternal by you who by reason of use have their senses exercised well when we used to work out man it was like it was like an adrenaline rush for those of you that worked i know your dad did it was an adrenaline rush when i go in there and we start working out it felt good why because you were exercising your body your muscles are made to be used amen some of us use it in other ways now yes yeah and we get round we get in shape around shape but watch what this will help you do though watch what's this this exercise this reason of use will do what bob was talking about discernment this morning discern both good and evil the tree of knowledge of good and evil you can't do away with that tree but it has some good in it oh it's what it says tree of knowledge of good and evil we use that tree of knowledge right now and i want to tell you those guys did a wonderful job because when y'all sing now you don't just sing the chorus because the verses are up there and some of the songs that you didn't know you got them on the screen and for you older folks to send big letters up here so you can see it we got one right here that we can see for us younger people but for the older people it's back here for y'all but i really appreciate that because you know what i don't want you you know who somebody was saying well we've seen the course and then through the verse we don't know what we're going to let ain't worship seem to sing sing out the praises of god you got to sing the uh the letter of what it is but that but look strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those i'm sorry levi he told me not to move even those who by reason of use listen just try what does jesus tell the people try me try me lay something on me give me your burdens give me give me this i am available to receive this i can handle it for you the problem is we go i'll handle that i'll handle that no i thought the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and then all these other things will come into line so lay it on him he said to put your burdens on me give it to me and i'll handle it for you you've got to discern though what's good and evil though in everything we do as bob said discernment is knowing a difference i discern that brother callie is not going to ever be as loud as me never you didn't have to say that so loud and finally you said something loud and that was that man i'm gonna start using somebody else but i mean really why because we know that because what we have discerned through his life he hasn't had to raise his voice maybe he did admiring some of the kids but not not here right we discern that we know that that's his nature so same way with the word of god and all the things that we study we've got to discern is this good you say well the word of god is not evil no it's not but satan can use that word of god to make it evil one more time satan can jump in the word of god because what's he doing today he jumped into the word of god and he said oh it's okay to wear pants ladies oh it's okay to baptize father son holy ghost oh it's okay to do this he's using the word so he jumps into it but you got what is our discernment today we read the same scriptures they read not a different version we don't have a baptist version or a methodist version or even a message version there is a message version of the version of the bible yeah look at all these false doctrines you'll realize there is there's a message version but we got to use our senses exercise to discern both good and evil now here's hebrews 6 verse 1. remember let's go to it but remember what i said this morning this is a continuation of the thought of paul because he said therefore what after all this i just told you use your use your senses to to exercise your senses to know good and evil therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ now look it's not like i like what a preacher said it's not leaving and leaving it back there it's bringing it with you because it's become a part of you it's become a part of you so you're leaving it as far as staying in that atmosphere of well i mean listen we may have a visit or two but that's okay people has been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ do you have to be baptized again tomorrow do you have to explain to yourself why that it the bible says to be baptized the name of the lord jesus christ so you've left that but what you done was you didn't leave it there to change your doctrine you just took it with you so leaving leaving the principles of the new birth everybody all right with this leaving the principles of the new birth let us go on unto perfection so this and that this and right here listen the bible tells you right there you're not perfected totally by just being born again read it therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on let us go on unto perfection look not laying again the foundation look not laying again the foundation remember if you've been justified saying fine you got the new birth any sin you have come on people any sin you have from their backs gone gone never to be remembered again but you still got to grow because you got to go back through the process again to be sanctified is to have faith that god has already finished it you know your finished product at the new birth we've heard brother many many times you're sealed until the day of your redemption the bible says brother brown said they shut the box car they put a seal on it can't get in it can't get out of it but listen that product has got to reach its destination before it's any good you can load that box car full full of hamburger meat if you let it sit there a long time it's going to rot though it may be sealed but what has it got to do it's got to go to its end or to its destination before it's any good maybe the best hamburger meat in the whole entire world if it sits in there it'll rot if it sits in here it'll rot right am i all right y'all more awake to the morning afternoon you are this morning good we'll do this again of the doctrine of baptism look i'm sorry repentance from dead works and of faith toward god not laying again the foundation so we're not sitting here going now well now brother you're saying that we got to build another foundation no the bible didn't say tell you that and i'm not telling you that you got to build on the foundation you already got and if your foundation's on sinking sand oh i always was this seed i must have been born again when i was born the first time no when it says new birth that means your first birth wasn't good enough and you needed salvation you needed to have that old nature killed out of you and then god entered in by the new birth and birthed you into the family of god put his soul inside of your soul not that his soul was already there that can't happen you can bring me a million quotes from anybody you want to bring but there's one thing for sure i know when i was doing the things of the world there wasn't a god inside of me yeah there was a god it was a god of this evil age right right louis i was totally contrary to god so were you oh no i was this little miss goody tootsu i didn't say miss mr and mrs good two shoes make it broad rebecca make it broad so that you don't have to say well he was talking about the women no we all were dead we were all dead that's what the bible says you were all dead and trespassing sin now where is eternal life it's in the mind of god knowing you would come to it and you would want it more than life itself i was tired sick and tired of being sick and tired of the doctrine of baptism and the laying on of hands that hurts a lot of people it says we've got to get away from that of the doctrine of baptism what's he saying you know it's wonderful to preach on water baptism and we do every once in a while because we have new people but could you stand at every service no the one that wanted ruth don't shake your head so bad like that she's like oh but i mean what if i came in and and that's all i preached every service acts 2 38 yeah right wow it would be become boring because i've already done that i've already laid that foundation i want to move on up a little bit further by the way day 66 more but 65 more bucks to preach out of right but that's your desire because you're pulling now you're pulling on what you need [Music] of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead you know if there's never a resurrection of the dead which we've seen in this church if there never was one that doesn't mean we're not mature christians you go back to the works part you can raise a million dead people and still be lost lost lost have i not let's go to the bible have i not lord have i not done this done that done the other yeah but you never knew who i was you never went on further with me you stopped and said this is it and of eternal judgment and this we will do look if god permit now listen that opened the door god did not permit them to come to full restoration in the first church age second church age third all the way up until this age so brother darty god didn't permit that to happen during the ages he permitted it to happen in this age because we're going home this is a time of leaving this is heading toward the end of the gentile dispensation for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have preached the message of the hour and have used the gifts may i interpolate just a minute and use the gifts and were partakers of the holy ghost not an indwelling partakers an anointing and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come i listened to a preacher with my own ears standing preach the best message i ever heard on the millennium in the future home and he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl during the time he was preaching message preacher preach like a lark i mean i got all kind of information from that message but was he born again obviously not it may be now but i'm telling you that's what happens if you get under an anointing and god will he'll use that anointing to give it out man read anointed ones at the end time it'll open you up but have tasted the good word of god the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away look at them now look at them now falling away from the message that preached the message of the hour i mean boom boom boom if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified of themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame now they didn't crucify the son of man they crucified that baptism of the holy ghost that son of god revelation you can't come off of a son of man revelation in other words you can't go backwards once we move into the moving of the son of man we can't go back to the son of god revelation we what therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of the son of god we are moving on to the doctrine of the son of man can't go backwards with god you got to go forward all right that's why i told you we're trying to pull everybody we can everybody we can needs to have this revelation because it's required in this age no other age for the earth which for the earth which strengthens in the rain that cometh often up upon it oft upon it and bringing forth herbs meat for them to whom it is dressed receiveth blessings from god but that which bear thorns and briars man i'm getting ready to plant my garden and you know what these thorns and briar's already there they got there before the real seed did that's usually what happens and now under cursing who's end now look they have an end whose end is to be burned not by the fire y'all were singing about but by a judgment fire but beloved we are persuaded better things of you that'll just make you feel so calm but brother beloved we are persuaded better things of you you can do better than this and things that accompany salvation though we they speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor unrighteous to forget your late work and labor of love what climbing up that you perfect man climbing up it's easy to slide and back slide but to climb a mountain is hard but once you get to the top i've never seen anybody get to the top of a mountain and go [Music] what do they do first thing they do i made it i made it to the top of the mountain i may be dead dog tired but i made it there's one there's one moment of exuberation and that's what's going to happen when we get to the body change there's going to be one moment when we're changing the moment of twinkling out we're going to say we made it we got there worth every bit of it folks every bit of this young people old people all this is temporary satan has put all kind of lust and and all kind of desire and everything out here just throw the table out for you to get it in this but if you ever get god down in your soul it'll be one of the best satisfactions you'll ever have in your life it will be the most satisfaction you'll ever have in your life and then remember as when he gets in you he don't just go to sleep he's working he's working that little that little that little kakeda is on the side of that tree and you might look at that thing that thing hasn't moved in about a month but all of a sudden you you look down and you see something going same way with the chicken if you put that little chicken under a light and you can watch that chicken the chicken's laying there like this for six months you know all of a sudden he goes there's life there he wants to get out he wants to what reveal himself he wants to reveal that's what god is god wants it to reveal himself who in me and you not in a cocada and not in a a worm or whatever else you want to say no he wants to reveal himself and me and you where am i at but beloved we're persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have what minister to the saints and do minister all right how are you going to get it you're going to get it by ministering all right now watch verse 12 verse 11 and we desire that every one of you now this is paul talking to us or god talking to us through paul and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope what unto the end that's the third time he said it unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise you got to get somewhere where there's an inheritance faith and patience inherits the promise for when god made promise here we go for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee wow blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee wow and so after he had patiently endured abraham after he had patiently endured do you know listen i wrote myself a note here somewhere from genesis 18 is when the promise was made and circumcision was given everybody with me the new birth top of the new birth from genesis 18 he waited till genesis 21 to have the baby he took a 300 mile trip with grandma down to guerrier and give his wife away again made a little mistake while he's in his journey we're going to make mistakes in our journey but god said no no you come back here you got some work to do where i told you you got work to do about the time of life i'm going to visit you and then in genesis 21 sarah has a baby now watch and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise he waited 25 years but listen our promise is not just a new birth now sure the bible says the promises to you and your children then they're far off they'll that's the holy ghost that is a promise but what about our age the promise is full maturity is our age okay so meant for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife watch wherein god willing more abundantly to show who unto the heirs me and you unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath in other words you look in genesis 14. when he calls abraham he says abraham abram he says i will do this i will do this i will make you a great nation i will give you a child i will i will god was making an unconditional covenant that by two oh here we come now we had an immutability now we have two immutable things two got to have two and which was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which enters in what into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest after the order of melchizedek let me read this real quick brother brown said in hebrews chapter 6 paragraph 5 80 says now listen that by two immutable things and which is impossible for god to lie all right they don't have this one so just just listen to me brother brown said an impossibility and immutability is practically the same word can't change it can't move it has to stay the same can't change the immutability and impossibility brother brown said we have two things yes first his word said he would do it second was he swore an oath on it and he's going to do it instead of swearing he swore by himself so he's the one that's going to have it done what type of people should we be why should we be tossed about and run about and take the things of the world and act like this 1957 streamlined model christianity we want to be the old-fashioned type that takes god in his word and caused those things which were not as though they were if god said so that settles it amen if god said so that settles it why do we want you know what we do it's like a man i'll tell this little story i won't call any names but there was a man in our community he owed us rent on a building and it was due in like april the 5th something like that well here it is april 20 something and so i call him up and i say hey rent's due it's the 20-something of the month he proceeds to send me this 300-word dissertation and trying to tell me like how the indian settled the country and i mean it just it just deluded everything i sent him a message back and i said look the rent's due pay the rent or we're going to take over i don't want to hear nothing else have you ever heard people like that you know look donny your rents do because it's late you owe the rent 90 cents back we said now chevrolet in 1954 they made this car called an impala and they put this 326 inch motor in it and they come and they painted it green and then in 1965 so he goes through this two hour dissertation point point is what's that got to do with you owen rent that's the same way you know what that's what the devil does though he he convolutes or he or he waters down when god tells you to do something satan's going little blah blah and then you lose all that and donny never paid the rent i sent that message back and i said man you've got 15 minutes to go pay your rent because we're closing at 3 o'clock i said if you don't pay your rent i said your lock's been on that building for three months and this month your locks on it you owe the rent pay it or we're cutting the lock off he paid it about five minutes till time to go closing but that's nonsense to have to go through all that you sit there read the text and you just keep doing this that's not god folks when god says something you do it no excuses no watering down god's never watered his word down for nobody no he ain't gonna water it down for nobody he tells us and he's immutable so you know what that word immutable means unaltered and there is no change it is fixed it's fixed so let's just get into it it's fixed the way it is and it's not going to change we've got to change to get into him he doesn't have to change to get into us pay the rent but that's the way people are and that's the way that's the way the devil is well i can't i can't you know like we were talking other day about women wearing those leggings under the dress now you should not do that and never do it again i don't told you about that okay we don't want to do that not in this church whatever you wear under your dress is fine but when it hangs down below your dress it's pants i read you where the world even said it was pants so don't wear them all right do i have to explain that no i don't have to explain that you ought to know that it becomes a trend and it becomes a fashion do we want to be fashionable and trendy no we do not we want to be as far away from the world as we can get not as close as we can get remember who owns the fence satan owns the fence everybody with me all right we done talked about this one time i'm not going to talk about it again but don't be uh offended if the deacon walks up to you and tell you not to wear those no more i'm not going to dilute it i'm not going to convolute it just don't do it let's read this last quote we'll be finished yes i give this unto them so is this the sign of the end sir now listen to this i want to listen don't you listen to this and see how immutable god is how unaltered he is god send a prophet you know god what god sent a prophet for one thing put the word back together man had convoluted man had said no we ain't doing this we're not doing that we think this is what he said no he sent a prophet to say look but he did it with grace so listen let's stop our thought process just for a minute and let's just stay right here are they okay we're right here we're right there where the holy spirit's gonna seal everything together and start using you more as a unit so now let's read this they've got it up there now let's note a few of these mysteries if you want to write them down first i'll take what scofield you know what's in your scofield bible so you can read that first i'll take what scofield says in matthew 13. if you'd like to type some of them down if you haven't got a scofield bible you might read what do you think some of the mysteries are now in the 11th verse and he answered and said unto them because it's given to you his disciples because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it is not given so it's not given to the world everybody with me all right stay awake just ten more minutes look now watch the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is scripture it's a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation listen folks it's not a revelation now for your sisters not to cut your hair i shouldn't be you should know that's in the bible and it's revealed to you so you don't have listen if you're if you're if your car is heading toward the beauty shop and it's something besides getting a little color you didn't think i'd say that did you then there's something wrong i mean if you make an appointment to get your hair cut women you don't have the new birth so it doesn't bother us anymore see there's leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ that's leaving that part but bringing it with us not doing away with it bringing it with us what and become more and more but why don't you cut your hair all because bro wait said not to do it now let me get right and it's not just that god said it there's a supernatural element there besides that being revealed to you there's an element in there you read the bible because the bible is giving you a type of cutting off your headship it's not just cutting to the hair you're cutting off your head because god wants you sisters to have long hair because he wants it to be a symbol or a mystery that the world can't understand listen 99 of this world does what cuts their hair oh i'm sorry 99.99 of the world cuts their hair so they sister and they've gone away from that they've left the principle but they don't know what the principle is so it's normal to fill up the boutique or the beauty shop with women normal to them normal but you've moved away from that that doesn't bother you anymore so let's go on and say lord i don't want to cut myself off from you man come on people we are the bride we are the bride spiritually we don't let our hair i mean naturally we don't let our hair grow but spiritually we do everybody understand what i'm saying here's your supernatural element underneath the mystery the mystery says men cut their hair women don't what is that to me and you do's and don'ts it ain't dudes and don'ts it's a love for your husband to not do that brother the bible says brother brown didn't say this the bible says you dishonor your head and brother brown even goes so far and said if you do if you do wives if you do that your husband is duty bound to divorce you because you dishonored your headship that's how serious it is everybody with me got a little quiet there for a second but that's the supernatural revelation that me and you got to get that element underneath it none of us are supposed to cut our hair off because you cut yourself off from christ right nobody with me there so you say well no that it's just do's and don'ts no there's a supernatural element all under that mystery there's something like marriage in divorce you take serpent seed tied directly to marriage in divorce but i didn't know that when i was 14 years old didn't have the new birth i just read to where where um she was beguiled and and sister rebecca i knew about what happened in the garden before it was a revelation but see i couldn't fit everything together because that was one of the great mysteries in the end time and i'll read what brother brown says in a minute but i couldn't tie it together in that me and you had a problem with it christ can divorce us for having another husband that's the supernatural element the natural element says if your wife runs around on you you can divorce and marry another woman anybody okay with that you look when you start saying marriage and divorce man people like imagine divorce has never been one of these preacher ever gets preached in marriage and divorce none of this happens everybody's like let's go home supposed to shout over everything you hear all right trying to break it up a little bit but there's the supernatural element brother brown tells us there's a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are now he he quotes them from from schofield but he continues on listen to this number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven that's the one we're talking on now matthew 13 3 to 50. now how many people in this world know what the kingdom of heaven is it's a baptism of the holy ghost it's not a kingdom set up over here that's the new city that's the supernatural element underneath the revelation that you're the city but there's going to be a physical city over here and not everybody's going to live in it only the bride is going to live in that city that's the supernatural element underneath the revelation now second mystery is a mystery of what israel's blindness during this age in other words not during this age layout to see it during this gentile age because they were blinded down here remember right why were they blinded why were they blinded so they couldn't see who christ was but we could great mystery do we see him now the way we're supposed to that's my question to you but with the supernatural element i can see that that son of man's here today the world don't know anything about the son of man sorry the denominations don't know anything about the son of man oh he was god and he was he was the second person in human flesh and and um he was my savior and that's fine that's fine in their little box but we're not in that box it's not our box to have we left that principle and brought it with us though and got rid of the bad part which was the trinitarian doctrine and the false baptism took the real baptism and we've continued on keep growing all right everybody okay we've got about 10 more minutes the third mystery is the mystery of the translation of the living saints go to your denominations and ask them say do we all have to die yes we're all going to die donny oh yeah we what do you mean you go read them the bible we which are alive and remain oh well we got all that because mama said you ever heard that before mama said well like i said before i got in trouble with it if mama said that she's a liar she's deceived i'm sorry i'm talking about mama church see you got the you got to get to revelation underneath the mystery here mama church is telling us all things are okay these are all right don't worry about it if you don't get saved the first time you'll get another chance that's a lie he is filthy filthy still righteous righteous still where'd that come from that's the bible third mystery is a mystery of the translation of living saints at the end time of this age that mystery we understand and what's the supernatural element underneath that it's me and you me and you not a group an individual the fourth mystery of the new testament church is one body composed of jews and gentiles i'll continue on because i'll cover this again i will back up on this let's go the fifth mystery because there's about 11 of them this fifth mystery is of the church as the bride of christ remember brother brown had to separate him he said this is the church and this is the bride the church goes through the tribulation the church goes to the white throne judgment the bride does not that's our great mystery that's the supernatural element that we see because you go to the denominations again and i'm not beating on them i'm just telling you what they believe they all believe we got to go to the white throne judgment ask one of them we all got to go that white throne judgment we're going to have seven years of tribulation we're going that's not true that's the supernatural element took a prophet to bring that out sixth mystery of the living cross the same yesterday today and forever and many places like that the seventh mystery is of god even christ as the incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied embodied in whom all divine wisdom not a second person not a second person of a trinity and godliness is restored to man oh you ain't worth nothing and i ain't worth nothing we can't make it loudly while you will you know what they're saying that their belief can't take them to where this is telling you in thessalonians we which are alive and remain so who cut them off their self but see the supernatural element shows us that there is a bride that's going to come to the end time and stand up and be the fullness of the godhead bodily not that he is we are and godliness is restored to man what is godliness there's one right here but this is all godliness oh man we can't do this no you can't but god can't if you'll let him the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity boy this is a big one now watch this they're living under that if you're not born again the mystery of iniquity has not been revealed to you because that's the man of sin and he's sitting in your temple he's sitting in those denominations and they're over there saying no we know who the man of sin is that's rome that's this person over here that's that's this great beast that's going to come up out of the ocean and that's just that's a mystery but the supernatural element tells us go read annoying ones at 10 times you read annoying ones at the end time there's your supernatural element everything's antichrist with the bride even foolish virgin sorry if you're if you're if you're a christ you're going in rapture if you're not you're not about okay just a few more minutes the ninth mystery is a mystery of iniquity now remember when the mystery of iniquity when was it unveiled or when was it when was it revealed under the first seal right under the first seal mystery of iniquity was revealed under the first deal when that first seal broke that white horse rider was not the holy ghost it was the antichrist that was the mystery of iniquity and it's a mystery but to me and you it's not a mystery anymore the mystery has become history because me and you know that underlying that supernatural element is if you're born again you're not in that system but if you're not born again that white horse rider is riding in you everybody all right the tenth mysteries of the seven stars of revelation it took a prophet of god we stood one day in a methodist church and somebody was asking us questions me and dad both there they asked me to do a men's breakfast fellowship for the his brother at the methodist church and one of the other young ministers said well what's this i heard that y'all were um you know that's a church a that you had wesley and lutheran wesleyan you know you might and then dad's brother said well that's just being a man follower i thought well you're standing in a methodist church that got their method of worship from one man john wesley one man and you don't believe in having a man lead you what he was getting at is he knew we you know brother branham was the prophet and he was our leader you know but it took a profit to tell us who those seven stars were and god confirmed it by writing it on the wall the same thing brother branham had preached so their mystery is they're seven messengers the the supernatural element is we know every one of them and the characteristics that's why i tell you these people that don't like sorry guys where y'all at in ohio some people don't believe the church age books worth reading now they don't but i'm telling you it's kind of prevalent in ohio because lee wales put up there and uh they said it was level's book and his wife's book and it's all this man i'm telling you you taking out a lot of the message of the hour if you don't read that church's book that church age book was vindicated by god through a prophet by writing it on the wall of the church ages and their characteristics and everything was right amen but it's something we all fight we we don't fight it so much down here but up north that's pretty prevalent because they they don't like brotherly bale to just be honest with you they didn't like him so they don't want to read his his book but that book to me is those seven mysteries of the stars and who the seven messengers was and their characteristics in the very city that they were told laodicea all the way every one of these had a characteristic all these cities remember laodicea was what destroyed by an earthquake they became very prominent a lot of money and all this stuff just like layout to see it become rich in the need of nothing don't tell me that wasn't god that was god that separated those ages through the messenger of the hour and he gave it to us and transposed it on a piece of faith i don't care if a woman wrote it down the prophet of god preached it that's enough for me the 11th mystery is the mystery babylon the prostitute well see that mystery is hell for me and you because the whole world don't know who she is we know who she is and we know where she's at and she's inside of you if you don't have the new birth see that we can bring it in closer now bring it in closer now what brother brown said that's some of the mysteries that this angel is supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of god and the other watch this may i say this with reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of god he brings out these mysteries we'll close right here the serpent seed that's been a hidden mystery all through the years try that on people try that try that great mystery on people that it was sex in the garden and not an apple somebody eat my lord if it was an apple we need we need several billion apples if then women will put their clothes back on by eating by eating an apple okay the serpent seed has been hidden mystery all through the years look the gray straightened out not disgraced he's talking about marriage and divorce this is 1965. this is marriage and divorce the grace straightened out the grace not grace straightened out the grace straightened out not disgrace but real true grace we needed that grace that was a supernatural element the mystery was already in the bible you can't help but one wife your husband's got to be living right that's in the bible but there's an underlying supernatural element that if you don't get it we're all in trouble boy you get quiet when people start talking about marriage and divorce and stuff like that man i praise god i'm free i praise god god's freed me from that stuff i've accepted the grace not disgrace and doing it over and over again he said don't ever do it again we all need that grace if potential adultery is kissing a woman if potential adultery is blessing after a woman in your mind you've committed adultery with her we're dead and we have no hope but we get that grace right there not disgrace but real true grace no such a thing as an eternal burning hell try that on the denomination man they preach that you're going to burn eternally not going to happen folks you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal this is how simple it is anything that was eternal never had a beginning or an end and hell was created all those mysteries the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has broughted in titles of father son holy ghost and the mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism in the name of jesus christ according to the book of revelations that the church in this time was to receive there is some of the mysteries the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the mysteries one right after the other the mystery of the seals the mystery of all this daniel 70 weeks the mysteries have been revealed and as brother brown said the mystery has become history the only great mystery is what paul said was christ in you the hope of glory let's stand to our feet that's a great mystery that we've got to understand well brother wade you just said he was in us yeah he's in us but we're not letting him have full control come on musicians we let him have full control that's the supernatural element not that we're just born again but we strive we push we pull we look at grace we read our bible we read it with different eyes than we read it when we were younger we read it with understanding we read it now with grace a great god that knew we would get in trouble if he put us in flesh but he did it because you had to make a choice in making a choice we decide where we go he doesn't decide where we go i just read you the bible or just quoted you where he said i wish that all people be saved i come to save every one of them but he knew when he got on that cross exactly who would be saved and who would not that's why i liked that song when i was on the cross he was on the cross i was on his mind he didn't have the whole world on his mind he was dying for his bride everybody that would accept him he only he knew so many would accept him and that's all and there's another mystery in there the mystery of predestination it's not just stamped and pulled you through a tube like some people say no you have a choice you're a free moral agent you're you're a free moral agent going up that statue of perfect man you can decide to stop anytime you want to or you can decide as paul said to go on to perfection not laying against the foundation of all these different doctrines that we've started on and that's good that we have newborn babies in christ i love to see them because man they're just so energetic but as you continue on the journey you get a little more weary and you get a little more worn you see people falling away the devil starts putting more in your mind he's not going to quit he's never going to let up but god didn't either and you know what he put provision for you to make it or he couldn't have said what he said in the bible he made provisions so somebody's got to get in that provision and make that provision and make it he has provided whatever we need to make it we just gotta decide whether we want it or not let's go ahead spread your wings little eagles [Music] [Applause] [Music] you were born [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you weren't born for another mystery you were born from this mystery you were born for this revelation in the end don't let trials get you down or drive your spirit to the ground [Music] one more time [Music] [Applause] to the ground [Music] have you ever watched an eagle you know they're so confident they'll just pop up on a little a little ledge and they'll just sit there and they'll look around every once in a while and you'll see them kind of they're getting them digested they're in their feathers they're going through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and then they look out there and say well i got to go a little higher i'm going to have to want to twist them out just a little bit more to virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and you look around you say oh about two miles down through there there's some fresh meat i eagles don't drink milk eagles have never drank milk they eat meat even from the baby they're the only animal that's in the the you know my linox man and eagle that doesn't start off drinking milk all the others drink milk except the eagle but what does mother eagle do she doesn't take and just force everything down your throat oh he could take a rabbit and force it down it killed the child it killed a little eagle what's mama eagle do pulls off a little at a time gets a message ready for sunday and wednesday softens it up a little bit and says all right open up and she drops it down in and that little eagle gets bigger and bigger to ju through virtue knowledge temperance you know he's got wings all the time he didn't grow a set of wings after he was a baby after he you know came out of the shell no he always had the wings he just didn't know what to do with them i mean he said you watch them they'll sit there and they'll do this they're like man this dude's never gonna fly but what happens is that mama eagle she takes them on test flights [Music] they hang on to mama for a little while they hang on to mama and she flies around and says well you can do this takes him back to the nest and then what did she do she don't just sit there and go i think i'll pad this just a little bit more no no no she builds it remember she builds it out of thorns but she pads it with her real plush feathers she pulls the feathers out and puts it in pulls the feathers out and puts those feathers in it becomes real soft when you're just a baby in christ god puts you on that soft pillow now look the thorns are still there the thorns are always there but she puts a layer on top of that to soften and you can be comfortable when you start through your journey god hears your voice and your little child and he gives you things that now sometimes you can't find god amen but what happens is sister rebecca every once in a while the mama is going to take some feathers out she's not doing anything to the thorns they're still there the kids are there but she knows by taking them out on their test flight they're ready to go i don't want you sitting in my house anymore my nest that's why we want our kids to leave when they get a certain age hey man not y'all we're talking about y'all but what'd she do she said all right she says i think they've had got some virtue and some knowledge they've got some temperance now they got some patience and the little old bird comes back and kind of goes um i definitely ain't sitting down [Music] if he didn't get a he'd get a crude awakening all right but what's mama say mama says time to go time for you to go eat some meat time for you to go make you a nest time for you to get the holy ghost and get out there and show who you are show who you are then the eagles man i love to watch we went to alaska several years ago and they're everywhere up there man they're just sitting on every land they're just sitting there they're doing this a big old white head looking around like this they're observing everything and all of a sudden what happens is they kind of do this brother louise they can't do this and they turn their wings and then buddy when they set them when they set them wings they're gone they don't have to flop they're watching that wind they're watching that current and they can see it bearing weekend they'll either watch the leaves or something because we were watching them they would pitch they'd pitch off of those limbs and down through we were we were whale watching and they'd come in through that through that valley and they'd never even do this just like this down if you want to pick up a fish they'd pick a fish up and then they'd have to do their arms to get back up but it was effortless [Music] we can't make an airplane oh we can fly all over the world but we can't make an airplane that can maneuver like they can maneuver because god gave them a special wing two of them brother brown said the old testament and the new testament and we spread those wings and we fly it's time for us to get out of the nest time for us to soar like eagles be what you've already been made for you're made for eagles you're made to be this way so let's not pretend anymore we're not crows and we're not buzzards we're eagles let's act like eagles let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us father we pray that you'll be with each one lord sanctify us lord for this journey take and pull all
