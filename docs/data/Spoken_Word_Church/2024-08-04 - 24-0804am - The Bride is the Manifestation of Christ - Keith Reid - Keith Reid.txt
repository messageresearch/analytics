[Music] Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy holy holy I want to see you amen praise God you may be seated just for a while we certainly want to thank God for this privilege of being in his house this morning and um to have that privilege to be able to worship Our God in a day like this amen with having known who we right and The God Who has called us Amen to this great faith that the Saints once hold on to you know we look at these young men who were down there and know you look at them up there you know you're getting holder it start to revealed to me that um I I've always felt the way I felt when I was 18 years old when I first come to the message but now I I realize they treat me like an Helder but um when I I I don't feel that way but when I look in the mirror I see gray you know so I know amen I'm not as young as I used to be amen we certainly thank God for the experiences that we have had over the years and um the way that God has dealt with us amen that I can be of help to the body of Christ Christ I certainly want to do my portion and um you know I certainly thank God for my precious brother Wade said pastor Wade D amen praise God you know I remember one time he was going to go to Oklahoma um to be in that vote and I I went and tell Brother Sam I said Brother Sam never let what happen to brother Spencer happened to you because brother Spencer is always complaining that brother Fraser steal his son so [Laughter] amen so we we certainly appreciate you Pastor and um I say to you you love your pastor give him all the support they they need it we see the things that are happening today the passing of the men of God and um you know when brother Chandler passed I I was actually in Uganda and there's some sisters from our church that is there in London and you know she was saying that you know the pressure that the pastor have to go through you know it seems he had an hard failure so you know you you got to take care of the men of God you know the Bible says God will take away the Candlestick from out of your midst really um you know if anybody ever understand what a pastor go through you'd be running from it you know but but it seems like I've been pastoring now it's going on to 30 years you know so it's a long time you know I've seen many things those who you love you know turn you down and um you know they give you a heartache and all of that is like a parent to your children but we we certainly thank God for the men of God you know I um at Ash Wednesday you know I actually did what brother Brady asked me to do for many many years you know brother Brady is at a state now where he can hear you listens to you but he can't respond and you know before now he he would have responded but you you say something about now and he start way back there because he shortterm memory is just gone until everything is just gone and so and um you you know I I was looking at that experience really you know I I promised brother Brady brother Brady always wanted me to take over the church and that's the church that I come from that's my pastor but you know now I'm a Shepherd myself and I I can't do it so I said brother Brady if anything happened to you I I'll see to the transition and um I I was like the butler that was in the dungeon with Joseph I forget all about it and then you know it dared me that um I I made a promise to brother Brady I'm going to keep my promise but you know um God is so good that before brother Brady got to that stage when I tell him that he he he stopped calling me for everything and and called brother vman and so brother vman is a wonderful man of God wonderful young Minister and um you know so I decided and I went over and I told the church I said um you know I'm I'm going to come and I'm going to preach cuz we need to ordain brother vman Clark as the pastor of the church and you know there were some people who weren't too you know good with it really because you know you know the experience when there's a boy that grew up from you know him when he was in diapers and now he's going to become your pastor it's kind of hard you know for the older ones really but I thank God you know when we made a vote he got 95% of the vote you know um the people were real satisfied and so brother Brady they thought we were going to park him no we're going to take care of our Elder you know and so and give him all the support and you know just take care of his every needs but you know a church needs a man that is strong you know and and that was the experience really so I certainly thank God if you are in Ruth uh this coming week then you'll meet brother vman a wonderful man of God he's a vice principal of the high school in OAS and his wife is a nurse and they've got two children son and a daughter and um I guess he's the closest Pastor to me back home in Jamaica because he passed the church that I'm from you know so I mean we we see transitions really and it's hard to be here and Brother Sam is not here really Brother Sam has been my teacher you know over the years I was telling brother Wade that you know I've got notes that I have 20 years ago you you remember this this was in Manchester you know and I still use them and um I certainly thank God for my ass association with this body of Christ it has certainly helped me and um I I can say from here um the brothers in um uh Western Uganda who are listening to us today I salute you I said God bless you because we had the same teacher and um you know like I tell brother W you you you might not understand but while you are here having church and you're dealing with your local Affairs really there's people different parts of the world that are listening to you that you're you're not just a little church in Lula you know but they're 8 hours ahead of us really so they dismiss and they gather again and they're listening to you because they're having church with you really so always remember whatever you do it's like you're a big brother always what you do there are young ones that are watching you and so you got to conduct yourself right amen so we we certainly thank God for the foundation that we have and the experience you know um they we we use the term the Lord give and the Lord take but you know sometimes we understand that not the right way it's not like you give a a child a toy and then tomorrow you take the child the toy from the child no God changes your experience as you grow and and God who know the end from the beginning he understand all the experiences that you will go through to to bring you to that day of the translation and and this is just one of that experience that God has given to you know that which you have received now give it you know and so and so we we we thank God for the experience that we have had and we also thank God because it's God's program that he has changed our experience and now that which we have received you know let us see what we do with it because it's bringing us onto a translation amen praise God and um you know by by my association with this assemble you know I today go to Africa and I'm bringing this word to them the brother Dale always say to me I'm concerned about the change of the body the opening of the word and and that's what we want to preach to the people because there's a message that prepares a bride for a Rapture amen you you know we can we we can take the word of God and we can preach all the uh the the the the fundamental doctrines and all of that really but there's a revelation of the word and and you know we could have been in Pentecost if that's all that we needed but God sent us a voice in the last day and he break open the seal and he bring it down to us really that we can be you know the people that receive Hallelujah the word to bring a body change amen praise God so we we we ought to be careful that we don't bring the word of God to psychology to tell you how you are to do this and do that and so no it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen that will change you amen and I say many times if if the word you're hearing not changing you not maturing you it's not doing you no good amen but it must bring you from glory to glory to glory amen cuz we're walking into a change amen so God bless you God bless you I thank God that you are together and that God has changed your experience and let us now live in the glory of that which God is doing really it was hard for the children of Israel to accept Joshua who was with them there in in Egypt and so but it was God's doing you know and uh Moses really you know I mean Rock them in the cradle and take care of of them and cry with them but Joshua had a sword and so and God knows exactly what they had need of let us say God knows exactly what we have need of so you know take care of brother weed amen I've got to speak on the behalf of a pastor because I'm a pastor and I know what a pastor go through amen so God bless you with you stand this morning we want to turn our books to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and I'm going to read from verse three and verse 4 um like to share a message that I've Shar back home you know the the bride is the manifestation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we got to know who she is then we know how we are to act and conduct ourselves and and all of that really amen so as you find it this morning let us just talk to the author of the word let's bow our heads our gracious God and our father Lord what tremendous responsibility that you have given to us in this hour that Lord God we must look in the pages of this blessed word and to depart oh God to our people that does not conform to our voices but the revelation of Jesus Christ that oh God you have placed for the people to bring about a change Heavenly Father we pray that as we come together Lord God May that word become preeminence in our lives and Lord God may you fashion us oh God into the image of Jesus Christ it is easy for us oh God to emulate one another but Lord that's not what we seek we we need to become oh God the fashion of Christ oh God that he might be revealed Lord as the Bible declared to us that the woman is the glory of the man that the bride is the glory of Christ bring us to that image Lord God we pray and father we thank you God and we'll give you the preeminence that is due unto your name remember the sick and The Afflicted and those that are without oh God we pray that you would bless them and be with them oh God and Father may we come to that position where more and more we see who we are according to the word bless us now as we look to you and believe you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen do you love him amen amen praise God thank you in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse4 the Bible says but if our gospel be here it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated if our gospel be ID if this end Time Gospel is not revealed to you it might be because you are lost in other words when we say you're lost you're not forn of God Amen somebody Hallelujah am in whom the Bible says the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not because Christ is the image of God hallelujah but I'd like to bring down that image this morning because not only is Christ the image of God but you know the bride is the image of Jesus Christ amen praise God you know brother B said a Baptist Minister once uh you know said to him he said you know I I can't accept Revelation he said then you cannot accept the Bible because you cannot accept Christ because he's a revelation of God Amen is God revealed in flesh Hallelujah amen therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation Peter knew him by the flesh Paul knew him by Revelation but Peter had to come to that position when Jesus said who do men say that I the son of man am oh they say you're the Jeremiah you're Isaiah you are one of the prophets because yes he is the son of man but he said who do you say that I am he said you are the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed art thou Simon by Jonah you are just a a little Stone but upon the rock of Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it God's church is not built upon denominationalism it's not built upon theology is built upon the revelation of who Jesus is amen hallelujah amen not who I am not who you are upon who Jesus is he ought to be the central theme of everything that we do Hallelujah in the first se he said Christ is a revelation of God in other words God revealing himself you see Jesus Christ he comes to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself he said in in otherwise uh you never know just what God was until Hallelujah he revealed himself through Christ amen amen so so show me God I give you Jesus Hallelujah show let me know my God I give you Jesus Christ is a revelation of God in other words it's God step forth and in flesh oh I like to say like this he become God become kin folk to You and I by The Plan of Redemption that Christ can die in your stead because God made an holy law and in that law the wages of sin is De Hallelujah so God said Ain folk to you not an animal not a lamb oh he was called the Lamb of God figuratively amen but he was God in flesh so he was all God yet he was all you and I King F to you so when he died he took your sin upon his body and he nailed it to the Cross oh can I tell you this morning your sin is paid for it's paid for in full you got nothing to worry about he paid it all God took care of it Hallelujah so we exalt him then hallelujah yes sir he's the high priest of our profession amen you know sometimes the preacher is trying to project the seventh angel but the seventh angel come to project Jesus Christ abolutely brother Bram is our eleasa Amen to bring us to our Isaac hallelujah amen who must be on display before you it's not elasa it's Jesus but every chapter every word is pointing to him Hallelujah in Colossians 1:12 Hallelujah as we exalt him now amen we want to take him out of History we want to bring him as Jesus Christ but there's a greater Revelation when it comes to you yes sir he said in verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image Hallelujah of the invisible God hallelujah amen amen God is invisible you want to see God you're going to see Christ oh Jesus Oh but we're coming down with it the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created and that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or Dominion our principalities our powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist who are we talking about Jesus Christ and he is the head of the body the church who is a beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence if we don't give Christ preeminence we're not Christians yes if we put any other image picture in it we're taking from the glory of Christ Hallelujah so when oh I like to say it like this uh on the seventh month of 1963 and on the 28th day the day of life cuz 28 mean life I'm glad I was born the 28th of this month amen the first thing was he said that God wanted to reveal himself to his people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who cover all space Time and Eternity no Hallelujah he could not he's too great to even be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious amen he could that hallah how could that great being ever did begin that after when beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into eternity that great creature that was all that and still is amen but that he wanted to do he loved father wood amen he for he was a father and the only way that he could express was to become son of man hallelujah what a mystery amen that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man the son of man Jesus is the son of man brother Brandon was a son of man Elijah Hallelujah Elijah was a son of man Jeremiah was a son of man named in the world a son of man but Jesus Christ is the son of man Hallelujah glory to God Amen they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it Hallelujah he wanted to express himself he was is one of the great trold purpose was to express himself identify himself with human being H to reveal himself in Christ Oh Glory secondly he have to have the preeminence in in the body of Believers and Brethren many times we don't break that down and look at that Christ want to have the preeminence sometime pastors want to have the preeminence leaders want to have the preeminence the government want the preeminence uh but among the body of Believers uh Christ must be first person is greater to you than your wife than your children sisters is greater to you than your husband Christ must be the first person in your life Hallelujah Glory that's what he wants to be nothing more nothing less hallelujah amen he wants to have preeminence in your life amen amen his bride that he might live in people every walk you walk every talk you talk every decision you make Christ want to be the center theme of what you do hallelujah amen he could do it that he want to do it in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now they had to come way to get back again it fell in the Garden of Eden and God waited all 6,000 years uh that he come to Hallelujah the last thousand and in seven Church ages he's trying to do itth and God waited he waited he waited until the most deceiving age that there would be he waited until the greatest Fallen away he waited until it seemed like nothing could happen if there was an age that anything could come out of uh you would think not this one but God waited Hallelujah God know that there's going to be something in you you might not see but God see it Hallelujah hallu Gideon did not see what God say about him he thought he was defeated but when the angel of the Lord speak to Gideon he said oh mighty man of Valor stand up on your feet Hallelujah don't believe the devil's life for your life take what God said about you amen hallelujah he's a savior and he had to express that Hallelujah and how could he do it only through Christ amen hallelujah how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a Healer only through Christ all things are wound up in one person Jesus Christ amen hallelujah I just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just going Hallelujah when I see God's Great purpose amen revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christen the fullness of the godhead bodily amen and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people hallelujah that he could have preeminence the oversight the leading you know we take 2 Corinthians 5:21 the Bible said he becomes sin you believe that he becom sin for me in other words all my sin is upon him then can you believe the other portion that I might be the righteousness if he took my sin and he gave me his righteousness it's not what I think no sir it's not what the devil tell me about myself it is what God state in his word hallelujah as to believe what he said about me Glory you lose your self-esteem by believing what people say about you but you've got to believe what God said about you and start to walk in the light of what God says amen they say you're nothing they say you're a failure they say you wouldn't amount to anything but what did God say about you he said I'm a royal priesthood I'm an holy nation I'm peculiar people oh he said you're not in the winner circle you are the winner you you know some years back I watched the Olympic and you know they they run the race and the race is so close that the athletes are looking at each other they don't know who is the winner and so they start to look at the monitor to find out and and somebody's walking down defeated and some hey you are the winner Hallelujah that's you this morning you didn't realize you are the winner Amen in super sign paragraph 109 he said oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one believe that the super sign the first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his church the super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign in the last day and the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days are we in the last days oh virgin shall conceive and that conception when it is brought forth will be God manifested in flesh that's the super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign notice they've got Superman today hallelujah it's a fictional of a Superman amen all those other kinds of super things uh but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh amen the Creator to God is back into the church and he's not back in the church as he was in Pentecost where there was an anointing of the Holy Ghost uh upon the church uh but Revelation 10:1 the mighty Angel Christ uh has come down Hallelujah when amen when the seventh angel messenger was here on the earth is that right he mean he come to come to reveal Christ to you and I he was not the Christ but was sent forth Amen to reveal Christ to you is that right that's why we hear his voice is that right amen because he's telling us about him that we don't know we've never seen him amen but the revelation of the world is bringing him Hallelujah him in tangible before us uh today amen hallelujah amen if that was a super sign of that day when that same spirit that was Upon Jesus Christ comes into his church amen to manifest the written word for today yes hallelujah amen that is still the super sign amen amen then he said John 14:23 Jesus tell them he said if a man love me hallelujah amen amen glory if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make his aboard with him hallelujah huj amen Christ Hallelujah the mystery paragraph 160 said God expressed in Jesus Christ who is both Father Son and Holy Ghost amen you you see we we got to clarify that Jesus Christ is not second person he's not first person he's not third person he is the person Hallelujah the Lord your God is one Lord hallelujah and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart am amen glory to God he said now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church amen the preeminence Hallelujah all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church the believer amen amen hallelujah so Colossians 1:26 now he's speaking to you he said even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now that mystery that was hid that mystery is made manifest Hallelujah Glory it's Comfort to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery the Gentiles oh brother brother Dale used to say to us this is a make known age Hallelujah and what is that mystery Christ in you the hope of glory amen that settles it amen hallelujah amen Christ is in you amen you know now I want to know how much of him is in me right Hallelujah and he in me what privilege does that give me what should that do to me Hallelujah the unveiling of God 77 he said now when it said here that he emptied himself he poured himself out let me paraphrase he said it's not that like somebody vomit out no sir but he changes mask hallelujah what he was he now

a prophet and they begin to preach the Hallelujah the very periphery amen you know what water baptism in Jesus name and amen there is one God and and all of that and all that is good it's a good foundation amen but there's something more amen Revelation 101 that the mighty Angel Christ has come down Amen brother brand was in that room he was going to preach another message like it preached for years Hallelujah and he said I would have made an awful mistake but he came into the room and he has not left Revelation 101 was fulfilled Oh Glory to God and when he come down Hallelujah he had a voice and he said it was like a lion roar when he speak and when he speak seven tunder hotter their Voice Hallelujah and John said I was going to write what the seven tunder hotter but he said write

anointed ones in the last days he said not when he begins hallelujah amen to preach his may but when he begin to declare the message and the message begins with the opening of the word the book was open because he take the book in Revelation 5 but in Revelation 101 when he come he had an open book Hallelujah and the Thunders amen came out of the book yet it was a mystery to those who read the book all these years uh but when an Isaac come on the scene amen and there was a Rebecca ready Amen to wait Isaac then he begin to tell her who ISAC really is amen so he preached now who is this Mel

a pastor you've gained a witness on the other side that is seeing you and said go on count the years as months count the months as weeks for any day now we'll be going home we're waiting on the last one you know what brother brandham said he said the last one might be a black one that's what he said amen in these little village that when we go inside there the first thing they do brother way they make a fire and they put a pot with water on the fire and they start to cook food you know feed them and then give them the word right amen my right you see them coming out of those Corners out of those little tents and they're coming you know you you you say the words and tears run down their eyes because this the greatest reality that has ever come their way my amen hallelujah people people live in places where if their crop fail next year they're going to die of starvation because that's the only way they they don't use no money cuz they there's no shop to buy anything they plant they reap they store I remember there in the forest of Ghana you know when it was meal time you know them little sisters had to go from midday 12:00 they start to go to that storage area and they begin to take out those corn and and you know peel everything from it and they shell it into a Mart and they they begin to beat it because they they're coming up with a meal you know but they they start from the very beginning they they had no machine to to grind those corn those little sisters man I tell you they work if a man ever get a wife from those region he's got a good wife and I tell you for me a Westerner when you heat that it feel like something is crawling down your throat really cuz it's so rough but you know that's their daily meal but when we get into the Tabernacle and we begin to speak of the word of God we come in equal plain field cuz they've got the revelation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah glory to God my do you love him amen amen yes sir he said now watch Hallelujah choosing a bride 170 he said the other is pregnated with the seed word of God Amen and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the bride I'm sorry the body of Christ isn't finished yet he says hallelujah how many knows that a man and his wife is one and Christ is one one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body hallelujah amen and the two together makes the one body again amen like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own Hallelujah his mind of course is in his will and his will Hallelujah W will is his word amen so you think a thought you're not your own amen it's because of him living inside of you amen Ephesians 5:29 for no man ever yet hate his own flesh but nourish and cherish it even the Lord the church do you ever think that that's how God think of you you are his body if you're hting is hurting Hallelujah glory for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bone now here are the body of Christ and you are members in particular amen so an invisible Union then he said but you remember when it went down the grain begin to ripen and you find before the grain can ripen everything in that stock as to be dead amen right amen he chopping off your yesterday he chopping off your ignorance amen he's chopping off your backsliding he bringing into the maturity of his word amen hallelujah can't you see where we standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in the bride form amen same power did he say that same power same church same thing same word amen the same word suck up through those and come up here hallelujah and come to the head here and all that life that comes through here picks up its people now it's forming up into the head for the Rapture hallelujah amen how many believe you're Raptor ready this morning Hallelujah I'm living for that change hallelujah amen I'm trying to do a part of the the final Works amen you know we were there and you know i' preach Hallelujah on the Capstone and amen the turd pool and I get together in the office with the brothers and they said oh we we got to preach different to our people because now they're seeing that this message is not just God sent a prophet it's not just you know baptism in Jesus name oh one more one more got baptized or one more got healed all of that is in it but it comes to form the image of Christ Hallelujah a people together it doesn't matter your status it doesn't matter your race no it doesn't matter where you come from we're coming to the form image of Christ the word hallelujah you're coming to that place where it's a word that's matter things that are to be if we are those attributes of God and how many know we are amen you're the Eternal attribute of God you were with him in attribute form germ form in the beginning now you're being expressed by the word it's the word that speak Who You Are not the sign you were born under they said y you're Virgo you are this and you ought to be that no if that still speak of you then you're not the word amen you are the form image of Christ we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because a bride is part of her bridegroom Hallelujah like any wife is part of her husband I say to the men the way you treat your wife is your revelation of Christ and the bride if you be unreasonable it's because of your Revelation amen amen if if you can't live to your wife according to the word there's no Revelation in you oh that's just me but that's the way I see it because that's our greatest example is that right amen amen praise God Amen Hallelujah she get disappointed in me sometimes you know when I travel she see the way I I put my clothes if I washed them I stuck them in she said I don't know what to do with this man but I do my best you know I'm improving I I'm just under the construction tomorrow I'll be better amen but but that's it you are the image of Jesus Christ you are the wife of God Amen you wear the wedding band of predestination Hallelujah there's none that come before you and all that he selected the Bride of all seven age you are the cream of the crop for you they without us cannot be made perfect amen man I tell you my wife has high standards of me if I could just be what she wants me to be but greater if I can be what Christ wants me to be amen hallelujah am amen so you know she's talking I just make a joke of it really you know CU that's what it ought to be so I text my girls I said your mama's got man problem if you don't do according to this word then Jesus got bride problem he's got wife problem amen but he said pastors to straighten you out to bring you back to that position amen that's just how I am that's my characteristic amen amen hallu hallelujah I I want my life to be that Christ is satisfied with me amen amen absolutely he said like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of the hour the bride not a Creed not a denomination but a living arkle of God Amen a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attribute of God Amen in the formation of the Bride amen that's to be expressed in this hour that we are now living that's where we are oh as we practice here on Earth brother BR the greatest that God gives a man outside of his salvation is a good wife and if we practice that then feed on the word then our Revelation can you imagine when we don't shout at each other at home and Malice with each other at home and we come to the house of God in unity the unity of the body of Christ hey that's it amen hallelujah amen man ought to know how to treat his wife the way you want God to treat you amen and so you got to live in such a way that God is is satisfied with you amen amen I'm going to close here somewhere hallelujah amen in Romans 8:28 for we know that all things work together for our good to them that love God Amen I remember brother hongoro was sharing with us one time and he said they were going to Florida to preach and he said I I don't know where he got that but he said he said to St he said I know a new way I found a new way to go and brother Homer said he was driving and um he said they it was to take them as far as he's concerned might be two hours he said we're going 3 hours and and he said hom do you know where you're going yep said I know this new way said Homer give me the map and she looked at the path that he was taking and where they should be there was no way they're going to make make the service they were way on the other side of Florida the master said oh my you are [Laughter] lost Hallelujah but you know but all things work together for for your good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen David had some pitfalls that when we look at them we said how could this man ever be anything and God said about David is a man after my own heart when David took your's wife I'm closing the David think that everything was all right he put you right at the front of the batt and he was dead but there's a prophet there's a voice that's right and gave him a riddle and David said bring me that man let me I'm the judge here he said David you are that man you see the heart of David is David get down to God Psalm 51 have mercy upon me oh God according we've got to realize that we are weak but he's strong amen that you've got to take side with God against yourself amen that I don't want my way I want his way but you know that wasn't the hardest thing in the eyes of God that David did when go David number Israel when he number the people you see there was a way that that God have that he should take the census of the people and in that census every man was to pay after shakle the Bible says that you die not goded a way it was a type of redemption that God was showing that the price that was paid for your life is the same price paid for mine and I want to tell you this morning don't think that your salvation is better than mine the price that was paid for mine is the same price that is paid for yours that was what God but when David thought that if he knew the number of Israel then he might be Mighty in battle God did not accept that God wants you to know every day of your life that it's not because of you it's because of him so we know that all things work together for our good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did forn or light the spot he also did predestined to be conformed to the image of his son you could not be otherwise you were born for this purpose for this purpose you came for Hallelujah from the mind of God you are expressed for this purpose Hallelujah and you are privileged to the pattern to which God has brought you to this Riv amen amen hallelujah for who did did forn he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many Brethren amen first to the revelation of Jesus Christ amen first to the opening of the book amen hallelujah we are first that the seals are open Hallelujah the seven tunders reveal and not because K crows was up on our land you know you go some place and you say seven Thunders and they begin to fall up in a cocoon but the seven tunders are the Mysteries that are contained within the Seven Seals amen and in that mystery Hallelujah you see Revelation 101 was the announcement but Revelation 81 was the scene and in that scene when the mighty Angel come down and the revelation of who I am was made known that I'm a part of my savior and my savior is a part of me even the angels of heaven was silent for half an hour they didn't believe that you could make it but Christ in you you Christ in you is a Hope Of Glory Hallelujah there's no devil in hell that can stop [Applause] you the 2,000 demons that are released from the river Freight they can't stop you you are sold out to Christ you're giving Christ preeminence in your life amen you are born for this purpose Hallelujah and if you have not your life has got a reflecting every day every day amen hallelujah so in 2 Corinthians 3:17 he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with an open face behold in a glass the glory of the Lord we are being changed into that same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord amen that Spirit of the Lord in this hour is causing you to conform to the image of Jesus Christ amen listen the devil might hold you in a place for a while but you're if you are the seed of God he can't hold you forever Paul says when I hear the word the gospel of my salvation which when I believe I was sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise he said which is the earnest down payment until the Redemption of the purchased possession Hallelujah Jesus had to know who he is he said I come from God and I'm going back to God hallelujah thank you Lord Amor said I know whom I believe and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day right you're going to have pitfalls Abraham had them David had them Hey listen Glory but when you have an anchor hold in Jesus Christ no devil can stop you amen hallelujah cuz you are the wife of God and you've got to manifest him on the face of the Earth today may God bless you amen may God bless you may God bless you God bless you because you know who you are God bless you Pastor may we bow our heads everywhere hallelujah amen give me one more hand clap of PR I believe he believes what he believes and know what brother Dale always said he said I believe that brother believes what he believes and we believe it too we're the last and mor Fe of God the last thing that men are going to see on this Earth is you and me yes and then the next thing's going to happen is if you're not a Jew you're going to be seen at a white Throne judgment you don't want that no accept him now grab a hold of this now grab a hold of what's going on now grab a hold of the word of God now grab a hold of eternal life now if you don't have eternal life I hope you don't sleep until you get it amen I hope God troubles your water cuz like a many I've said before po listen we're in a battle this is a battleship this ain't a cruise ship we don't have we don't go out and sit around the beach and no it's a battle it's a fight and listen we've been given the greatest thing to fight with and that's the word of God and like I told y'all many times before the devil cannot get eternal life but you can right be privileged to know that God has opened up enough a door for uterus Eve eternal life and the devil can't get it so listen if you receive eternal life Satan can't he can oh he bother you but he can't take hold CU you got God in you and he hates that God's in us and he can't do anything about it but that's all right he made his choice long long time ago he made his choice to become Satan God created imperfect I was thinking the other day I thought man you know when we come to Earth we're born and a soul comes into us and we really don't know anything about it you know what's going on till we're five or 6 years old we don't remember a whole lot of things and then we start developing and we realized that my name's Bob or my name's this or my name's that right but the devil was created just like he wasn't and then he came from God am I preaching to a different place group of people he just was there and he developed right there and God developed him full grown give him something to do made him the anointed cherub I made you perfect he kept telling him I made you all these things but you know what the difference in him and us we believed what God Said and we stayed in our position he didn't believe what the very man that created him he didn't believe what he said but we do as the Bride of Jesus Christ we had to come across this Chasm we had to come here lost we had to come here in these bodies but guess what that's way God wanted it he didn't want it no other way no other way than to express himself through us and I believe that's why brother Bram came and gave us a message to see who we are and what we're doing here and why we're here don't ever sit around and say why am I here realize realize who you are Hallelujah realize why you're here realize why we've had to go through these trials and
