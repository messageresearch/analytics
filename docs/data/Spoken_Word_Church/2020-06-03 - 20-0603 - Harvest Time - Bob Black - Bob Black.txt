see [Music] shining in the light of your glory or after powering Oh [Music] shining all around your power [Music] Oh [Music] Oh I want to see [Music] a man it's good to see you this evening I was really surprised that all the cars in the parking lot every bus everybody wants to come to church praise the Lord [Applause] you know it's just it's getting kind of crazy out out there you know Louie in the news and all the things happening and everything and remember the beginning of this year all these wild fires and things is like the whole earth was on fire and things just keep stacking up almost I'm ready to get out here you gotta we got to get out of here but there there is a way that God has provided so I just want to take a look at that tonight and good to see all your smiling bright eyes and faces and all that tonight ready ready to get into the wound so so we're gonna read tonight from Matthew chapter 4 verses 2 to 4 and and then kind of on further down that that chapter but we'll start with Matthew Matthew chapter 4 verses 2 to 4 testing testing good let's go to the Lord in prayer well God we're so grateful to be able to gather together and look into your word tonight or when we pray Lord I my prayer is that someone will be strengthened Lord that like that we sung that song tonight Lord that our eyes will be open Lord Jesus to see the day in the hour that we're living in to and him to be able to look into the mystery that's been hidden from generations and and there's now revealed to the Gentiles this thing that's been hidden Lord God I but now I believe that the veil has been torn off of it so that we can see plainly who we are who you are and and what what's going on in these days I pray God the night that you'll just build our faith and strengthen this Lord Jesus so that when we leave Lord there'll be a spring and our step and a song in our heart knowing Lord Jesus that you care for us that you're there for us that you provided for us you've given us a way of escape you made a way for us know Jesus we thank you for these things we ask Lord that you'll now open the word to so when the open our eyes will God and give us understanding we pray in your name Amen so Matthew chapter 4 verses 2 to 4 and tonight I'm just gonna speak on a little topic of the harvest time and it says and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you may be seated the Lord I listen to the reading of the work so we'll find that you know in in this sermon I'm kind of once again preaching off of the sermon that brother brand priest so if you have any questions about the doctrine or the way that it's presented go listen to that service go listen to the harvest time so again I wanted to be saying it well brother Bob's preaching exactly what the prophecy he said say what I said so I'm just gonna take it my brother Bob you cheatin you're just taking your notes right out of the message I would that we at all cheating this way so you know when brother Branham was was a again you know I believe that the fivefold ministry was to take the big big golden nuggets that brother Branham preached and break them down into easily digestible chunks so that we could say oh I can digest that I can I can I can eat that now I can see now we can see that it's not just a message to kind of leave on in the back and and listen to it with with with kind of your eyes closed but maybe we could pull out some things that brother Branham would say in these sermons that would really identify something that's almost been mysterious as you listen to the messages you come to church you know many times it's the message seems real mysterious and it seems complicated and everything but if you just sit down and and just meditate on the word and meditate on the things that the Prophet is saying that the ministries are preaching it will slowly begin to open up to you and become as simple as can be as simple as as planting a little a little a little corn wheat in the ground and it grows and it grows into grooves and it come till it comes up and the same thing is there that was planted now you say well that's that's really simple we now you've made it too simple there's a lot of there's a lot of things in there there's a lot of things in between there that that we focus with a brother Brian preached to when he was preaching all these sermons to build our faith and to allow us to see this mystery this thing that's revealed in the harvest now one thing that's very interesting is that when brother Brown would preach these things or explain these things to us we realized that that that the devil's tactics never change and the way that God that God approaches things never changes either because he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever and the way that God moves things the way that he started and it started the whole creation the way that he he put brings things into existence the way he changes you the way he changes your mind it's all by the word by the spoken word and we know that the word is the expression of who he is the beginning he spoke the word the word came out from the Father like that little the pillar of fire and he began to speak the word because the word is the expression of the of the father the word is who that is expressed and he began to speak and said let there be and out from him came came matter and all these different kind of things and he created the world with his word well he's doing that exact same thing here tonight every time we come to church as the word goes for the word is not just some something that will go forth and just fall to the ground or something that just just floats away but it actually is accomplishing something it will accomplish its purpose as the Bible says it will renata not return to God void without having done something when the word goes forth it actually produces a change and it will produce a change in your life now that's maybe something difficult for a little baby to understand a little newborn baby in Christ to understand that the word is what will change you because when you come to the to the to the Lord you're looking for great big signs and wonders and all these kind of things maybe but it's the simplicity of the preaching of the gospel of the foolishness of the preaching of the gospel as Paul would say that that is actually transforming our mind Trent renewing our mind to changing us so that we we we are open it activates the spirit it provides a way for the spirit to come and quicken us and change us and and mold us into the image of that original seed which was the spoken word the spoken word is the original seed the original seed is what was planted when Christ died and was planted in the ground the original seed is what was lost down through the seven churches but the original seed is coming back so so as we can see the word is is there's really there's really two two kinds of break it is what brother Brian was pretty bringing out in this message there's two kinds of bread and I believe he preached this on the communion Sunday so that we're eating the communion bread and he said there was there's he made a point in here and I this is one of the things I want to just kind of bring out that there's two kind of bread there's natural bread and their spiritual bread and there's natural but a lot of times the devil what kind of will kind of throw some natural bread in front of you like every as we kind of study in this message that's one of the things that he said the devil did through Eve in the Garden of Eden was he tried to feed she tried to feed Adam some natural bread but that that natural bread when you go sit at your shuttle to supper table or whatever that'll feed your body it'll feed your flesh it'll feed your natural bread good old bread that you buy the grocery store it's got living in it and all that kind of stuff the things that you put in your mouth that will feed your body but there's only one thing that will feed your soul there's only one thing that will feed your soul and it's not natural bread it's not things to this world it's not things that that will make your flesh feel good it's not anything that will make your spirit happy there's only one thing that will feed your soul and that is the Word of God now now tonight see how simple it is that's that's really the way of escape for us that's the way that God has provided for us to get out of here as we see the world on fire all these thing people going crazy in the streets protesting all these things people can't can't get in one Accord we got racists fighting against one another and everybody's hating one another all these kind of things but yeah there's a little group of people who are catching the revelation that God had predestinated you to hear before the foundation of the world and he's changing you from the inside out catching you molding you so that that corn of wheat can be called away and the harvest and the great harvest that's what we're looking for is the harvest time and how do you know how do you know when the harvest is coming I'm really jumping around in my nose now how do you know how do you know when that harvest is almost attained do you know when the harvest is and bye-bye people going crazy in the streets well people have always been going crazy if you look at history you can read pol pot and how Joseph Stalin kill all those people and all down through history horrible things have happened that's not a sign that something is about to happen the sign that something is about that the harvest is about to take place is when you see the tares and the wheat ripening when you see the tears and the weed both coming up to ripening then you know that the harvest is at hand so look at yourself and examine yourself maybe tonight and see do I see the Word of God being ripened in my life because it's certainly being ripened in others maybe it's examination time tonight to be able to look at ourselves and say do I do I see the Word of God being made manifest in my life or have I just kind of been dilly dally in all these years maybe it's time for me to get busy with the Lord and busy with the word and get into the Bible and begin to understand the things that have been laying there all this time you know the Word of God is not a museum for us to go in and look at the world the message takes behind a wall of glass and say well look at there ain't that great that brother bran preached all these things in there in that fantastic but it's there for us to get into and dig in and find these little nuggets and things that will build our faith because the Word of God is the only meat for the soul it is the only thing that will change you it will actually transform you and renew you you see you see what where where does bread come from is you begin to meditate on that on that where does this kind of in the natural bread bread in the natural world bread comes from wheat that has been ground up with the little birds and baked in an oven and made into something well now in the spiritual sense Jesus Christ had to die on the cross his body was was ground up brother Aaron said it looked like hamburger meat Oh on the cross he he gave his life and he and he went down into the ground so that we could eat the body word of the Son of Man in this day so now when brother Branham was preaching this sermon he he began he really started off he started off with reading Matthew 4 but then he just jumped over to John chapter 6 verse 44 to 58 and it's very interesting let's go ahead and pull that up it's very interesting that he would begin to pull this because as we know as we're taught that the third pool is the opening of the world and this was in Jesus's third pool the the phase of his ministry of the third pool because he began to really open up the word and begin to preach to people things that were very mysterious so I want to stress again tonight if you begin to study the message and begin to hear things that are very mysterious as you're coming along don't get discouraged because these people these disciples they heard these same kind of the things that Jesus I'm gonna read to you right now they were very discouraged maybe that one in the world a lot of people just turned around and left and that's what brother Branham was getting at in this message don't don't let the things that you don't understand discourage you don't look at natural things and be discouraged but just keep walking on just keep hang on hang on to that word hold old to it and by-and-by it will open up to you and you will begin to understand John chapter 6 verse 44 says no man could come unto me except the Father which just sent me draw me and I will raise him up at the last day now isn't that an interesting statement that no man can come to me except the Father which I sent me draw him you know III think about that a lot when I think about the young people everything you know you can you can sit down with your kids and you can berate them and tell you why don't you shape up and all this kind of thing and they ain't gonna come to the Lord but I tell you what when the father begins to draw up they're gonna come they're gonna come runnin and so you see the way to get your children to the Lord is not to not to fuss at them and yell at them and all these kind of things but you turn the father loose on them and he'll draw them he'll put them through the wringer or whatever he needs to do and all of a sudden you'll begin to soften up their heart and something will begin to change and I know it's the truth I know it's a fact because if you see the father is doing something that you cannot do he's drunk he's you can't get in there with that heart I manipulate it and then do all those things but you see what he's doing is he's quicker than something that they've heard before where a preacher maybe said the Holy Ghost is for you well God has not forgotten you he sent his spirit into the church to prove to you that he loves you and all those kind of things and they might be sitting in their car on the side of the road somewhere or whatever the devil to get them down and out and think of nobody cares about them and the Spirit will begin to rule over them and begin to draw them and that's the father working on them because you see when the father draws you're going to come no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me drawing if we could really if we could really take that to heart I think it would change our approach with our families you wouldn't be dropping that anvil on your kids heads all the time you'd be you'd be getting down on your knees and calling out to God's here God move on that heart I believe I believe your word I believe that the promise which is to all your children and as many as the Lord our God shall call in Acts chapter 2 I believe that's for my children and you'll see something begin to happen when you put your faith to work and he says it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God and every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me and again where are you learning from you're learning from that father the father quickening the word speaking to you on the on the inside showing you things showing you that you're lost showing that you need a Savior showing that you need something and something begins to work on the inside he said no not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of God he has seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life oh my this is when they begin their that they begin to realize this man ain't just saying that he's just a good teacher or something he's saying that he is God he's saying that he's identifying himself with the Old Testament prophets that that manner that came down from heaven he's identifying himself with that he's saying something he says I am that Bread of Life your father's did eat manna in the and err this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat you see how easy it is to just argue over Scripture that's what brother Graham said you don't have to believe it just or understand it just believe it just believe it and and walk on now eventually God will open it up to you so that you do understand it I I don't subscribe to any of this nonsense that we just go around just I don't what do you believe I I don't know I I have no other way I believe we should understand what we were believing because if you believe if you say you believe something that you don't even understand and what wasn't that that sounds like madness that sounds that sounds like insanity to say that you're committed to something that you don't even understand now you know brother Brown said when you but when he preached that message investments why would you make an investment on something that you you don't you wouldn't put your make put your money into the Microsoft stock or something if you hadn't looked into it and figured out whether they were financially sound and all these kind of things well when you come to God you need to search like the Bereans did go through the scripture and find out whether these things be true find out whether the preacher behind the pulpit is preaching preaching the truth or not don't just sit there and I swallow up all the false doctrine and then swallow up everything and it just or just go home and and say well I don't understand it and that's just the way it's gonna be I believe I believe that when that when the father begins to draw you something begins to stir within your soul to make you hungry to find out whether these things are true and I it will get you on your knees it will get you in your Bible it will make you search and find out and he said and then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat man and our dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever Mele was sitting down watching one of those movies the other night that that was about Jesus it wasn't just some some movie but it was about Jesus and and this scene was playing and it really struck me how much of a lunatic a lot of these people must have thought because that that Jesus was saying these things were so so strange and everything so strange hard to understand a minute that's what many people turned away because they they just could not understand what are you saying that you're a vampire and you see that's why many that many don't continue on and they turn away but there's so much arguing going on there's so much debating until you know a lot of times the young people will say well how do we know what's true a lot of times the new message believers will come in and they'll say well how do we know what's true well you cannot know what's true or false you cannot know what's false until you know the genuine so hang on and let the genuine to be made manifest and then you haven't understood just hang on a while get into the word and the Lord will open it up to you he will reveal it to you as time goes by and program said in the harvest time 1964 he said now how could he be bred and the word and word all it would be puzzling to the carnal mind but we are hoping this morning that there is no carnal minds among us that there is a spiritual mind among us that we could understand what the father is trying to get to us here seeing these words are puzzling but at the same time they are scriptural truth see you see what's bringing us into one Accord is the Spirit of God revealing his word when the disciples were there in that Upper Room they were all the Bible says they were all in one Accord and why were they all went all in one Accord because they were all they had heard the preaching of the word for three and a half years they were all there expecting what Jesus had promised that the Spirit would come and and the word there in that upper room and it brought them into a place of one Accord the Bible says they were all praying and they were praying for that that thing to come they were up there waiting and expectation the what will bring us into one Accord is the Word of God the Word of God being an opened up to us you know I sometimes you hear message believers we say what are ministers I mean we say that we should we should we should all come together and that kind of thing but what will bring us together is the Word of God it's bringing us together into one Accord as tearing is holding us and like that masterpiece that brother Branham preached the masterpieces that all of the world is being chipped away so that we're in the in the right shape in the right form that God wants us to be in and that is what is bringing us into one Accord you see all these arguments and divisions and all those kind of things like brother Ryan was preaching when it when he when he was when he was preaching this sermon and he said how is God gonna judge the world is he gonna judge all these divisions in the Roman Catholic Church all these denominations how is he gonna judge the world by what will he just the world he's gonna judge it by the word by the Word of God not by any to particular dot denomination or an in particular church or any group of people around the message there were those kind of things he's going to judge it by the word because Jesus brother branham brother Ram taught in this message that Jesus is trying to get us as he prayed in John chapter 17 he's trying to get us into oneness brother I'm said not for some man to be over something it will never will work one denomination wants to take over the other and one man over the other one but that you might be one with God like Christ and God was one that's what the prayer is that he was the word and Jesus prayed that me we might be the word reflecting him that's his prayer to be answered that's real real being in real one accord with as you as you eat the word which is what we live by you become United with with the revealed word that God is presenting in this age you you becoming more and more in oneness with God that brings as the church becomes in more and more oneness on an individual level brings us more and more into oneness as a whole bride together and then the harvest can come and brother branham in this message he was really kind of iterating how how you can see all of these types and shadows just by looking at nature how that how that little seed goes into the ground and it comes up and in the spring and how how something is planted in the in the in the spring and harvested in the fall and and all these kind of things and then he began to talk about how that you know we don't believe in reincarnation because when a seed is planted the same the seed that comes up is gonna be the seed that goes down when Jesus went down into the grave what came up was not something different it was the same thing so I don't believe he was just saying that for no reason the reason he said we don't believe in reincarnation is because that seed that was planted in the first church age at the beginning of the first church age is the same see that's going to come up it's not gonna be something different it's not gonna be some kind of transplanted thing but it will be the exact same thing I wonder if we could get that revelation tonight if the brother had said if the bride can begin to realize who she is that she will be an invincible army if you couldn't begin to realize that you are that same juror that same that same seed that was planted in the beginning that same seed has come up now and it's time for the harvest because it's time for the harvest because it's come up now it's being made manifest in his people that's not too hard is it come on with me and he talked about how we can only eat barley live by eating dead substance and this and Christ had to die as we read in and and in the description earlier that he had to die so that we could we could eat his the body word of the son of man but you see there's two kinds of there's two kinds of bread there's two kinds of life there's two kinds of bread and there's our natural body is fed by natural bread but our soul is fed by the Word of God I wonder if we could really catch that revelation it would change where we spend all of our time yeah I believe you you know some some Saturdays when I'm working in the yard I'll just pull up put on the tape and just listen to it the other Saturday I was out there listening to a tape I actually listened to several and I was having me a little revival in the arc you know why because the word of God will transform you you you will catch something it will make you a new person yeah it will make you a different creature a different creature Oh get tired on me that's fast now hang on hang on with it it's only there's only 30 minutes not even 30 minute you know sometimes sometimes it when you see people falling asleep and everything and it makes the minister kind of struggle a little bit because you make it feel it makes you feel like people aren't interested you've been laboring all week or whatever and then you come to church and they kind of fall asleep now now is nappy time or whatever that's the hey oh now I'm not trying to be mean but yo y'all don't be mean to me I got to give it back to you a little bit but you see the Word of God is what God what the the gift that God has given to us to give us eternal life and in the Garden of Eden he gave Adam and Eve the Word of God which was providing them daily their youth was renewed every day by the Word of God and they kept eating on the Word of God and then the devil got in there and and he like poison the plant so to speak but there's a there's a wheat plant growing in the Garden of Eden and the devil comes in there and he and he sews his unbelief he says well you mistrust in the word well it tells Eve I got a better way of doing things I got some some information that you might not be aware of it may be Adam had a shared with you yet or God hadn't shared her however it planned out in it and it just squished the whole thing because you see brother Adam explained that that it's like a chain or it's like it's like a though as the wheat plant grows everything has to grow in continuity and if you get if you inject unbelief in there right in the middle of it it stops the whole plan you see as he as he was illustrating all of these believers down through the ages down through the Old Testament that he talked about their failures and how they failed believe in the Word of God like Samson who just got all wrapped up in women and everything even though God had given him a promise and he just he failed and and but you see this this church this this age is gonna have somebody that will not fail somebody that will believe God so completely so completely yield themselves that they will be the God will be able to produce in them that same seed that was planted in the first church age you see they when you just believe one word and the chain of God's Word you die just like in the Garden of Eden they just believe one word and the chain in the chain of God's Word and brother Brent quoted in Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 to 17 this is but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die you know when I was a younger Christian it almost makes you fearful a little bit well what does that mean does that mean if I if I if I just like if you're preaching if you don't say it like a robot if you don't just repeat brother branham absolutely like like a robot does that mean that it's off no what we're talking about is the revelation if you catch the revelation the rep the revelation is our absolute the revelation is the main thing that we're talking about the essence of the of what the word is the communication the thing that God is trying to communicate to us now when I get up behind the pulpit or brother wake us up we might use a little bit different words but we're communicating the same thing as we're communicating the maturity of the bride coming in to be we're communicating the same thing but maybe using different words so I just throw that in because I know sometimes that can that can get people scared and everything but get catch the revelation the revealed Word of God and don't be afraid don't be afraid to dig in and ask questions brother Branham said in paragraph 104 he said when this chain is broke with Adam and Eve the first family now remember they didn't break a sentence they didn't break three words one man shall hangover he'll buy every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's where man's eternal destination is determined why he'll hang by that chain or he'll hang by creed or if there's creed mixed into the chain there there is where the weak link is and you're going that's where the weak link was with Adam and Eve that weak link surely he said God but surely God said it and if God said it God meant it and he also keeps his word by saying the day you eat thereof that day you die that the day you put into you anything else besides the unadulterated Word of God into your soul that's the day that you're separated from God now I believe this this quote and the scripture that we just read in Genesis chapter 2 I believe that it will answer the question maybe a lot of people have the night why do we need to understand the message why do we need the capstone revelation why do we need the seven seals why do we need all these things open because one word off will produce death in other words one word off is gonna gonna take you to the ground but the reason why we had to have a prophet in this last day was to tie up all the loose ends I mean and he's gonna he's gonna fix all the miscommunication over the years all the he's gonna patch everything up so that you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing here where you came from where you're going the pro destination for knowledge all of these kind of everything is patched up so that yeah there's gonna be a bride in this endtime that it will not be one word off you see the gift of God that God has given us in this day that to bring to bring a prophets message to us to deliver us from death to allow us to leap over a troop lift over a wall all those things because it's taken away it's taken away from us our doubt it's answering all our questions we can come boldly before the throne of God after looking into this message with everything all of our answers there every every question we have is in the message about where we came from about what happened in the guard and all those all those kind of things answers all of our questions why do we need to understand the seven seals because it's taken us to full adoption full a full revelation a complete revelation of the Word of God you see because the Word of God is what's taking us it's not our own righteousness somebody said the other day well how can we how can we ever be a bit perfect enough to get out of here how can we ever be perfect enough to take a body change it's not your perfection that's really the secret it's not your righteousness it's God's righteousness brother I'm said in this very message he said now see it's not our good living that just something goes with it it is in our church loyalty that goes with it you say we put so much emphasis on everything else but the Word of God when the word of God should be the main thing that we're focused on but the main thing is staying with that word don't eat nothing else but that word stay with it he is that word now do you see how if you put all of your focus and your emphasis on the word instead of trying to manufacture a clean life the word will take care of you it will clean you up it will wash you up it will mold you into the image of God it will change you and if you put all of your focus on the word you cannot lose how can you lose if you put your focus on the word and you trip and fall as you're leaving the building spiritually or naturally the word will take care of you if you trip and fall and make a mistake just get back up and keep going because you're you're a believer you're trusting in the Lord you know if you if you mess up all you got to do just ask the Lord to forgive you God I messed up forgive me and just keep right on going if if you put your focus on the word and make that the main thing of your life God will take care of you bromas chapter 4 says for if Abraham were justified by works he hath aware of the glory but not before God for what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now that's a powerful scripture right there abraham believed God and that believing was candid in him for righteousness so you're believing the word is going to be counted to you for righteousness all the way up your journey all the way up now now that doesn't mean we're lit we don't live clean or whatever but believing right will make you clean because believing right will tell you how you're supposed to live and because you're believing right that will make your flesh obey your soul on the inside it will make you it will quicken you that that sings if that same spirit they quickened Jesus quickened his mortal body lives in you it will quicken your mortal body it will quicken you to his word now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is accounted is counted for righteousness you see how that just flips around all this preaching of legalism and everything you got a dress right you do have to dress right and all this kind of things but it starts from the inside and works its way out it's the inward work of grace coming out my goodness some of y'all lift up your weary heads arise now the sleepless this can't be that born ah look brother Branham was as he was preaching this message he talked about how how God down through the ages he tried to find a man that would that would live the word that would serve the law and he looked down through the ages as the prophets spoke his body into existence preach that how he would come and where he would come and he looked at lives like Noah and Abraham and Moses and David and and they all had a message for their day and brother Graham would preach about how how y'all pray for me now yo I got a push back against that sleepy spirit I big that sleepy spirit in the name of Jesus I rebuke it they had they had a message for their their day and they you know how strange it would be for know Abraham to preach Noah's message or Moses to preach Abraham's message and all those kind of things but the reason he said those things is because they're it's moving up to a final culmination Noah and Moses and Abraham they could not they made mistakes in their life they they fell away at the word they lost focus and they all know what got drunk Moses had lost patience everybody Abraham gave his wife away everybody in the Bible that you could live David soul is best friend out and to get his wife and all those kind of things they all messed up they goofed up but it was bringing up to a final culmination where that that seed would be revealed now you see he's compared in that as he brings preaches this message he's comparing the life of Jesus as the the prophets preached preached down through the Old Testament finally John the Baptist revealed the Son of Man at the end of the Old Testament he's comparing that with the same thing has got to happen with the bride as at the end of the Old Testament that the the wheat the wheat seed was revealed at the end of the New Testament that same seed has to be revealed the individuals in each age are reflecting that Morningstar he talked about how that you could see the life of that of that one and Noah and Abraham and Moses and David but finally you could see at the end of the age the Morningstar the one that it was talking about and now down through the seven church ages the light and each of those messengers were reflecting the light of the morning star but at the end of the age finally you see that morning star revealed in his completeness and his fullness walking in flesh again you see brother Branham said in the end paragraph 144 he said finally this perfect one arrived now he arrived to be tempted and every point just like we are the Bible said he was he was tempted like Noah he was tempted like Moses he was tempted like all the rest of them if we had time to break that down and show you but we haven't because I don't want to take too much of your time and he says he goes on in paragraph 145 Satan never changes this tactic neither does God just changes ages but Satan got it got him back there to the first family of God on earth here at his brother sister don't fail to get this how does Satan get the first family he couldn't break it no other way but to get that word broke so they were fortified behind that word if he could only get one gap that's how he has got every Church in every age you got every believer just pull that gap out well I believe the Bible is right but I don't believe that oh there he go too bad but there he win every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God in other words it matters what you believe and I believe we believe something here I was listening to somebody on on YouTube there was a minister that little conference thing they're all on stage and some of the ministers were talking about they were actually a denominational minister and they were talking about how even in denominator denominational ranks you find some of these big mega churches rising up and they're and they're preaching a gospel that doesn't have nothing to do with the cross and they don't even really know what Christianity is and my point is that it's important to understand what we believe and this man was talking about how that that he was at a dinner with some people and one of these big name preachers that he wouldn't name was sitting there and he said you know I was talking to a Islam person a big high-ranking Islam fella and he said I didn't realize how close Christianity was to Islam now the reason why he made a statement light a very shocking statement was because he didn't know what he believed he didn't realize that Islam doesn't even believe it doesn't even believe the New Testament he doesn't realize that they don't even believe that Jesus died on the cross and all those kind of thing they didn't even realize that all those differences because he didn't even realize what he believed so you see you got to know what you believe before you begin making judgments about other things you can you recognize the false if you don't even know what you believe what the real genuine is you've got to you got to come to a realization to search it out what the truth is before you'll know what the false is and my point is the reason I'm saying that is because at the end of this message brother Brown brings out that every harvest has to has two crops has got the tares real genuine you know even that that famous quote that we all like to quote when when when the bride can begin to recognize the two spirits in the framework of the church that all has something to do with the harvest time because if you can recognize the genuine then of course you're going to be able to recognize the Antichrist you can recognize the truth and of course you can recognize the false and the difference is the word of God the difference is that that that the false the false cannot impersonate the true revealed Word of God they could infer the devil could impersonate everything else but it cannot tread personate a true revelation you say well what brother brought that seems that seems very strange that the true genuine church will be running the aisles and and jumping on the backs of the pews and all these kind of things but I I thought that Jesus had a a calm he never had to yell and scream when he cast out Devils he knew his place he knew where he came from he knew what his purpose was in life he knew that he was he was called to preach a deliverance to the captives to preach to preach to the poor and all those things that would that he ran from Isaiah there is he still at stores stood in the temple he knew what his purpose was and he didn't have to get all excited sometimes sometimes we you see Jesus as you if you go back and study this message the harvest time Jesus was tempted by all these three things these three looking at signs and trying to trying to look at the supernatural trying to make himself a big position and all these kind of things in brother Branham the reason he brought this out was that he said you also in your Christian journey will be tempted the same way that Jesus was to try the devil is trying to draw you away from the main thing the main thing I say I know this this may be sounds like very almost the shallow boring sermon and everything but think about how deep this is if you just lift up your weary eyelids for a moment and think about how how the main thing is the word of God and how easy it seems for people to be drawn away do you realize at the end of this message at the harvest time brother when as brother Branham was preaching it he said it he quoted all those things about how what a small group is gonna be at the end time a small group now not a small group of Christians overall down through the seven churches not a small people and all of the bride but a small group of people that will come all the way to receiving the full word come all the way to adoption to the seals being open because people get so easily distracted by things they don't have nothin to do with the word brother Brahim said at paragraph 107 he said remember the Bible said in the mouths of three witnesses he said we'll get on that in a few minutes on the three temptations of Jesus the three temptations of ministers today where they make the fall three temptations of the church and where they make their fall three temptations of an organization where it makes its fall and the three temptations and the individuals and where they make their fall see the devil the devil always tries to tempt you in these same three ways as I was kind of listening and that's how I was I was pondering up does the devil just like creativity in Matthew chapter 4 verses 1 to 4 it says with that scripture that we read earlier he said but Jesus was led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward an hungred and when the depth tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God do you realize what the devil's doing there the devil was given Jesus something natural to look at do you realize what I was saying earlier about there's two different kinds of bread there's natural bread and their spiritual bread and instead of he was diverting Jesus's eyes from the natural trying to get his eyes off of the spiritual bread to the natural bread you know that's the same that same tactic he'll do to you because you'll get people get all caught up in a beautiful church or or a plush pews or not nice bathrooms or or here's the real kicker they want a nice a condole priest a condo preacher just don't over them and not preach anything that will that will help them along their journey not offend them at all you see when you begin to look for a condo priest you're looking at something natural and something instead of something that will feed your soul a condo priest might be kind to your outside or your spirit or whatever but it's not going to be helpful at all to your soul we want a flowery bed of ease so much times we want an easier to drive to church or maybe no drive at all well we can just kind of sit at home and stream in and we don't have to do anything we just might we just kick our feet up and drink a glass of lemonade because but we're looking at something natural and instead of something spiritual the world of God is what will feed your soul well here's the here's the real bad thing we look at other people instead of ourselves we look at everything in the world we'll look at brother Branham and all the supernatural things that happen in his life and we think that's got to happen in our life we look at the way that brother Dale conducts his life and we think of ministers think well I got to act like brother Dale well instead of just being what God calls us to be and we end up looking at one another instead of looking at the word do you realize if you look at the word you'll find your place in the word you'll find what you're supposed to be and you can see your path in your journey where you came from and all these kind of things but if you get caught up looking at other but somebody else you won't have that privilege because you'll be blinded to the things that the word has in it you'll you know here's another thing people get caught up I've seen this I've seen this happen and people get discouraged by the word and they feel like that it's not opening up quickly enough so they start they start deviating over where I'm gonna start studying Roman history I'm gonna study all about his lips - babbles I'm gonna study all about the Roma the history of the Romans and the Greeks and all these kind of things and now they've got devious it seems like it's profitable season like it might like it might be helpful in a sermon or whatever but yeah they're they've lost focus of the mystery that God is trying to reveal and they get off-track and and now they're just like Noah and Abraham and everybody else in the Old Testament all the things that have been spoken of where they just didn't continue on to a perfect understanding to a perfect revelation but if you keep going on and open up your life open up keep your eyes focused on Jesus he will take you to the finish of the road oh my you can you can you can get your you can get your eyes focused on world events now you can get your eyes this is something to really preach on if the Word of God is the only thing that will help you with your soul focus on all these news things and all that kind of stuff is not going to be profitable to you in the way that you think it will be you know I you know people I hope they don't listen to this but people at my work they they're getting all up in a tizzy by looking at I mean people are literally about to lose their minds because of looking at the things going on in the world and just being in a state of fear and calling people stupid because they're going out among getting to get groceries and stuffing and all this guy because people they don't have that same confidence that we can have by looking into the word the only the only place of peace a joy and and comfort in this in this kind of hour is the Word of God and you know here's a really hard one to preach on to is that sometimes sometimes the young people can get distracted by looking at their mom and dad by looking at their parents and they look at all the bad things that their parents used to do and they think they can to make excuses where I can my mom and dad used to used to just break out the lids unroll the scroll and read it out oh yeah oh yeah they did this and they did that and say all these things and they begin to look that's my excuse because my parents did it because I may be a minister when they were younger living wrong or whatever they they did these things and you began to look at that as an excuse at the natural bread instead of the bread for your soul the only thing that will change your soul is the Word of God you remember Josiah in the Bible that I one that I like to quote so much because of and then not because we have a job site here in the church but because of that Josiah and in the Bible his dad was an unbeliever and when he got old enough he began to say I'm going to I'm going to live the right kind of life and he didn't look at his dad he didn't look at all of his ancestry and all the ones that I lived before him that we're not living right but he lived according to the scripture he he he he he let the Word of God be food for his soul instead of the things that he could look at naturally brother Brandon this is the place in in his little and his sermon where he told that story maybe he told it other other places too about the raccoon how how he used to he'd get a he trapped raccoons by by taking a little a little brown thing and putting nails on it inside so that when the raccoon stuck his hand in there he he couldn't get it out and he put something flashy in there too so the raccoon would go after the interesting thing brother I said he put that was flashy was his dad would be smoking cigarettes and he on that little 10 was it look like a little aluminum logo or something he call it a tag and if you look up there's old old-timey tobacco tins or whatever they had a little tag on it they had the logo or the company or whatever and he'd take that thing off because it was real shiny and he put it down on the inside of that thing for the raccoon they're coming and stick his hand in there because this raccoon was attracted to the shiny thing just like how a lot of a lot of Christians today are attracted to the shiny thing and when the raccoon got his hand in there and that that tobacco logo that cigarette logo he wouldn't turn loose you see what a perfect description of one of our problems if you know when the preaching goes across the pulpit of this and it's just tearing up about smoking tobacco so vaping or doing smoking marijuana or looking at pornography or whatever that thing is or just your wrong doctrine I think that's one of the you know we talk about all the problems that the young people have but what about the problems that the old people have and a lot of the problems that the older ones have is turning loose of that old doctrine that you heard years ago that you just ask your pet doctrine you just can't let go with that thing you want to argue and debate it and the preachers just preaching away trying to get you to understand the true revelation of the gospel but if you'll just turn loose of that thing you can see the true how it really is in the Word of God and you'll be able to go forward until you turn lose until that raccoon turn loose he was trapped you might be born again tonight but you might be still trapped by some old doctrine that you can't let go of you got to turn loose brother Branham said I need some glasses he said everything that he promised that God promised in the Bible if you'll turn loose from every Creed every Creed I saw them old things that you've been taught that ain't right that you need to let go of if you'll turn loose from every Creed and everything else and hold on to the word God is obligated to take care of his word and so when they did this the word vindicates itself the word will vindicate itself and then another thing the next thing because brother Brown he goes through this series if you go back and listen to this I encourage you to let don't just take my word for it as levar burton used to say on Reading Rainbow just don't take don't just take my word for it but go back and find out for yourself yeah I'll make you laugh a little bit wake up go back and find out where brother Brown taught and he said as soon as the devil gets through with that test he'll go on to the next test if you pass that test he'll tempt you with something else and that next thing he'll tempt you where this is to give you something supernatural to look at my goodness what a trap that is my let's read it in Matthew chapter 4 verse 5 to 7 he says then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone not the devil that was quoting scripture he'll close gilchrist grip sure - like he did it even the garden he'll come to you with a false interpretation of the word and tell you like this brother Brian was preaching this sermon he was hitting on all these people saying when telling believers they couldn't get born again and that the days of miracles has passed and all that kind of stuff but the when the word is revealed it will interpret itself if you believe that if somebody tells you that the Holy Ghost is not for you just take God at His Word and find out whether it is not find out if God will give it to you or not but Jesus said unto Him it is written again thou shall not tempt the LORD thy God you see this is the this is like a step above the previous temptation where the devil is like okay if they didn't fall flat if they didn't fall for that one then I'll get there their eyes off of the word with this trick and you know one of the one of the slickest ways the devil could get into a congregation is it is by false gifts by maybe somebody it's doing something spiritual or something or having a dream or whatever or something come up somebody rise up and beget to say something that is patently untrue just completely false many times the devil will maybe come to young people and I preached on this before many times about how many how many young boys would come to my daughter and say well I had a dream or how many how many people will come to young girls out in the message that ministers that I've talked to many times and say all these boys from different countries and stuff would come around and say well I had a dream I had that something supernatural happened let's say you got to take it back to the word the word is our absolute we can outright we rely on footage sensations and excitement and all those kind of things but on the other hand let's Paul told Timothy let's not quench the spirit we get so far on one side until if somebody would have rise up and get catch a revelation and by stimulation they want to scream out and come to the altar or maybe run around the church then we look on them with poorni fingers and say that's not right that's not right but it might be right we just need to focus on the main thing which is the word of God the revealing of his word now now you could just because you run around and scream or something that is not an evidence that it may not be an evidence of anything the only evidence that we can rely upon is that rock they Jesus talked to Peter about the rock of revelations that I found my church on you can go back to that rock and and lay your head on it like Jacob did in the Old Testament and when he saw that ladder a rock of foundation that you cannot be shaken from like a man that builds his house not only seeking sin but on a rock that you will not be shaken from the rock of Revelation that's why brother Branham hit so many times you talked about how we can't put our confidence and feelings or an emotional experience or maybe you and a lot of crying or or or somebody rise up and prophesy contrary to the word and all these kind of things all in the hands and all these different kind of things you know we saw up in North Georgia a while back that everybody got kind of riled up about the old that was coming out of that Bible and of course if you go I'm not gonna say it from behind the pulpit if you could look it up google it what happened next but you see people put their confidence in those kind of things people put their confidence in that instead of trying to find what is real in the Word of God that's why Paul or Peter the 2nd Peter 1:16 he said this is so fantastic y'all get excited with me just for a few minutes hang on there women he said in verse 16 he said for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory not now the point I'm trying to make as we read this is he saw some amazing things but that is not what he where he put his confidence and whom I am well-pleased in this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountain we heard the voice in other words I went on the fishing trip with brother Branham I was there when he preached Christ to mystery God revealed I was that I did all those kind of thing I saw him speak to the people and turn his back on the audience I saw all those kind of things but in verse 19 Peter says we have also a more sure word of prophecy something more sure than all the things I saw with my natural eyes something more sure than anything that I saw while I was on a fishing trip or anything like that he said we're on to you well that you take heed as unto a light that shyness in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts what could be more sure than Jesus seeing Jesus and Peter and John and all them on the Mount of Transfiguration when a voice spoke from heaven and said this is my beloved son well hear ye him what could be more sure than that more sure than that is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you inside of your heart that came by you here in the Word of God in your age that's why that's why Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7 not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works why because they were looking at supernatural things something to get their mind off the true thing that they should be focused on which is the Word of God the Word of God is the main thing a revelation of his word let me read this this quote and the paragraph 3:14 in the harvest time and I reformatted this quote I hope it don't offend anybody but I put some some paragraph indentions and stuff in here so that maybe some things will stand out he said you say well this I don't care what this does and that does this is what the word says brother sister I'm trying to get that to you see it's what the word says we live by the word not what some evidence or some carnal something or some experience that don't have one thing to do with it any kind of an experience won't work if it denies the word many will succumb to me and say I prophesied casted out devils I spoke in tongues I done all of these things preach the gospel and in doctor of divinity said you work of radicular after all these things that the devil throws at you after he tries to give you something natural look here you can take that down now I'm done with that one after he after he puts things supernatural in your face you see you see what what's happening here you're as you go through all these temptations you were maturing in the word and you're beginning to recognize the tactics of the devil and you're beginning to recognize to be able to identify the true from the false as you come up higher and the next thing the devil will do to you is he'll offer you up a position of prestige in Matthew chapter 4 verse 8 to 10 it says again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and show with him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if that will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve now brother Branham he preached on how a lot of Ministers would kind of fall prey to this and they you know that be offered a big position and a denomination or are all this kind of things but you know that could happen even in a little simple church not being offered a big position or something but looking for prestige instead of the Word of God we're not coming you know I've preached this many times before we're not coming to church for prestige or to be somebody important we're coming to church to build character a lot of times to build character you need to be the doormat for a little bit and and sometimes if you can catch that revelation you'll be a willing doormat Willy I'd rather be a door for a doorman in the house of the Lord and then anything else David said I'd rather be just whatever God wants to me to be if he wants to to put me over to the side a little bit or or let people step on me or let me be just be a foot watch flunky or whatever it is but you know so many times we get in our heads that we got to be somebody big we got to be somebody important so we can tell everybody else what to do and and run the show and that kind of thing but maybe in this particular stage of your life that's not what God wants you to be and that will that will get in your way so many times I think I've shared this before from behind the pulpit but one time I was talking to a minister and I was just sharing to him that I believe that the fivefold ministry was was to preach what Ephesians 4:12 says to to bring to preach to so that the the the bride will come into the full unity of the faith and he was having he was having some real trouble with that and he was struggling with that and he said he said do you mean to tell me that that I've preached all around the world I've preached to all these different places and and he began to appeal to me with his position of prestige and and say well you in other words you're just a little a little foot watch flunky so to speak you're just a little doormat you're not as important as I am but you see position and prestige don't have nothing to do with the truth you know Pilate asked Jesus what is truth and then you turn and walked away and that's what so many people do they won't they don't want to know stick around and find out what truth is and if the if the the natural and the supernatural and all those things that the devil is put in your way before hadn't got in your mind your way of looking at the word and maybe he can get you with with prestige maybe if somebody doesn't treat you right in church maybe you'll turn around and walk out and say well I have a right to be treated a certain way but you don't have a right to be treated a certain way as a Christian you have forfeited your rights what we have a right to do is to be submitted in to the Potters hands so that he can mold us exactly the way he wants us and if we've turned out wrong or whatever and he needs to start over because we've messed up in our and our doctor and all this kind of things that he has a right to just crack us on the floor and start all over again he's got a right to do with I said whatever way he wants to do we are submissive in the Potters hands if he wants to just make us something that people can walk over or whatever you say you know I know brother brother Dale has preached this many times if the war you have no right to leave a church and I'm not preaching this because I think anybody's gonna leave or anything so don't get nervous you don't have a you don't have a right to leave a church if the word is being preached you don't have a right to leave if the musicians aren't playing the way you want them to or you don't have a right if you don't think there's enough signs and wonders going on the only reason you have a right to leave or to go anywhere else or to look at something else if the word is not being brought from behind the pulpit because the words the main thing but LeBron said in the power of transformation paragraph 117 he said if you the Methodists don't treat me right he's talking to the people who I'll go to the Baptist the Baptist don't treat me right I'll go to the Pentecostals if they don't treat me right I'll go back to the Catholics and whatever more see they it's a hybrid I have to get them sprayed oh I believe God wants us to be real Christians well we don't have to just baby one another and we can we can talk to each other like like real men and daughters of God face to face and say you hurt my feelings or whatever and apologize and and I don't understand this what you were preaching in this skit nose-to-nose feed the feet and say say it like a man or a woman we don't have to baby one another because look brother brother Brandon the point that he was getting I know I've gone a little bit longer than I think the thing he's getting to is that Matthew 24:24 has to be fulfilled which is that in a harvest there's going to be two of these crops because in Matthew 24:24 says for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect I'm trying to find a final kind of a place to let's keep going I see where we I know I always struggle with with ended brother I've said there's always twins there's been twins all down through the ages there was twins in the garden there was twins it with Balaam of Moses and Judas and Jesus and Cain and Abel and but there in the end time there's gonna be tears and wheat every revivals there's gonna be twins and and this time brother branham stressed how close it's gonna be that it would deceive that very elected if it was possible it would be so closed that if you didn't know what you were looking for it would deceive you that's how close it would be and that kind of parallels this parable that jesus said in matthew chapter 13 verse 24 to 30 I'm gonna skip down to verse 28 he said unto them an enemy hath done this talking about that somebody went in here and sowed tares the servants said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather of the tares ye root up also the wheat with them so you can't you can't tear up the tares you can't go around telling people you don't even have the new birth you can't go around ripping people up I don't even know why you're why what you're doing here do you think you're here just to pay the light bill or something you can't be go around tearing people up like that because in its time it will be made manifest in other words Jesus is telling you don't you don't know yet as it's growing up but when it comes to maturity you'll be able to tell the difference between the shuck and the wheat you'll be you'll be able to know what to look for let broke both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn brother Branham said in paragraph 135 a power transformation he said there's always twins and that's the reason don't forget this little flock the church and the last days is going to be twins so close that it'll deceive the elected the church is going to it's a Pentecostal move it's so much like the real thing till it will deceive the very elect if it was possible and a little later on if I get the chance I want to explain what how that election comes he is going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers that's all same other same church same movement same thing the Betty ground is the same where the word falls but one of them like here is perverted see one of them is a perversion because it's the wrong father and he goes on there's so many so many different kind of things that we could talk about what I'm knowing the ones that I would encourage you if you haven't listened to an only ones at the end time to listen to that I might help you to be able to deduce what he's talking about here the difference between the true and the false but but you see brother Brando and I really am trying to find a way to close here brother branham was talking about how there's a second atom and as the second bride and they that were bringing up down through the ages to a culmination point and he said Jesus had to be brought up through a long string of prophets and so forth and come out perfect and then he had to die in order to be bred for the rest of him and and then he said in another place well now what about Eve she has to do the same thing the bride was created a new lucky was at Pentecost spirit-filled and word fed then Eve met her failure so did the church down the word was Aten down down through the church ages and then it began to come back up and now at the end of the things no brother Brahim said in paragraph 340 he said now watch a corn of wheat falls into the ground now Jesus was that corn of wheat that fell into the ground which was made perfect it had life in it Moses didn't raise Adam didn't raise none of the rest of them race but this perfect one that reflected the word and every way every word he lived by how many can say Amen by that and so at the end of the Old Testament the musicians come up well I really am I promise I'm closing at the end of the age the perfect one came and at the end of this age the perfect one is coming again you see he said the perfect one that reflected the word and every way every word he lives by and then down at the bottom paragraph 341 he said now here comes the church again see coming to that perfect one for the rapture again in other words coming right back to the original grain that was planted at the beginning right back to the original thing if we could if we could catch a revelation of what that means that that revelation not only comes by the opening of the word the word is the main thing and as you eat the word and just pile that word on it's bringing
