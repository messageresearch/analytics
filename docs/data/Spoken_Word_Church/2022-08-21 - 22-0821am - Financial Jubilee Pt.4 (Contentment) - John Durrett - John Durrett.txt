========================================

heart you know continue with this financial jubilee so uh perhaps when everybody's out of debt and everybody's content then we'll stop financial jubilee but um certainly financial jubilee as i said you know if you look in the word and our prophet said that word jubilee means we can go free you know when you hear that trumpet sound we can go free by his grace and financial jubilee you know it's um talking about finances and money anyway it's not a i wouldn't say it's a deep subject you know it's a shallow subject i would say but it certainly have some some deep impacts to our life but one thing i was looking at earlier this week is even in shallow water people drown right shallow water and i was surprised is about 25 of drownings happen in shallow water and i got to thinking about that and i'm like my goodness you know a lot of the shallow water things that impact our lives that we would say shallow compared to the deep things which i know in this hour we need those deep things we know we're not going to have a rapture unless we can swim in the deep that's for sure but you know if we don't know how to swim in the shallow water we can certainly get drowned there as well know matter of fact there's something called a shallow water blackout and this impacts professional swimmers they get in there and they're swimming and they're holding their breath and they black out underwater and of course then their body reacts and they have to breathe and they end up drowning so it doesn't matter you know how long we've been in the message how long we've been in the word you know how long we've been doing things if we don't get these shallow water things we can have an ineffective christian life and we know our prophet said even you know you can get in those shallow water all that debris and you can get hung up in that debris although we have a power but if we don't know how to operate in that shallow water then we can get hung up and die and have an ineffective life and that's certainly not not the purpose brothers we want to go to the next slide and i was just reading this quote my kids and i we were playing the game of life i don't know if you all have played that game a couple weeks ago and um you know we i we hadn't played in a while so i was going through the instructions trying to remind them okay once you start you can you can choose to go to college or you can choose to start your career right away in the game and then you go on and then you you know you get married and you pick up a spouse along the way and it's a little car you put the spouse in the car and of course my girls they were like no put the man in the back he's going in the back so we all pray for them so you know and then the babies come along and you start putting a little peg they're like no we don't want any babies so yeah y'all just keep them in prayer but as we got to talking you know i was telling them i said you know yeah this is exactly like the word of god you know if we don't know the rules and we won't be effective in this life and as i was uh just looking through the quotes it's actually yesterday and this quote brother broom says and that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of life wrong and expect to win you've got to play it according to god's word and the purpose that you were brought here for now there are so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we now live people just seem to think that all they have to do is keep up with someone else with the fashions of this world and with the enticements of this world has given to them and that's exactly right you know in all of us in in this day and time it is such a a um a wicked day in time such a enticing day and time i mean my goodness it's like the world is going mad you know if you look at the internet social media i mean it's so much influence my goodness you can't run through your your facebook feeds without seeing this person is doing this to their house this person's getting this car this person is doing that this person is joined their meal i mean you can't even sit down and enjoy your meal without thinking i need to take a picture of it before we eat don't eat honey you wait let's show them that we're having shrimp and we're going to have this and that's all you see you know and this it's just all enticing and then we're trying to you know outdo the other one and i'll do the other one so it's very difficult to have contentment right you know and not just in the in the area of money but churches as well i mean you can find any church any minister that suits just how you want so if they move to the left you like that if they move backwards if they do the moonwalk i mean whatever you want you can find it if you want it really deep you can find it really deep if you want it really quiet you can find it really quiet whatever you want you can find it all right now we can pull it up right now and find many many different services so all of that is in our minds and is causing us to lose contentment and contentment just means satisfied with where you are right now today that's what it means that's what contentment is all about and it's very very important in all areas you got that within marriage money anxiety you got mental battles all of those things are those shallow water things that we get hung up in and we need god in his grace to get us out of those things go to the next and certainly you know those things are right in line although we have this word and this quote just says a lot just keep walking in the light it'll separate the thing that was hindering you from one side to the other that's the trouble with the church today you're so loaded down you can't walk light got too many things on you too much hanging around paul said let us lay aside every weight that we may walk light every weight and the sin that so easily beset us that we may run with patience the race that is set before us looking to the author and the finisher christ walk in the light light footed you know i i love i really love that quote you know because that that's when i look at financial jubilee and contentment that's really what it's saying trying to get us to where we can walk light and these principles of money they apply to all areas of your life even this word that we have it applies to the word and i've experienced that you know the same principles that i use to to get out of debt to learn this contentment it's the same principles that i see in walking this journey walking this path and again contentment it means satisfaction with one's possession status and situation as i mentioned it's the hardest age and the last thing we need in this age is discontentment and that's exactly what we're suffering with go to the next so in the in the area of money as you you hear this again you know this is just a parallel to apply to every area of your life but the wonderful thing about money what i like about it is all of us can relate as i said before all of us can relate to it you're working for it you're getting up in the morning before you're talking about it you're wondering how much your spouse is spending all of that we deal with it every day so we can all relate to it and i believe god knew that and that's why he said so many things in his word about money but this quote this this message and this scripture i think just brings it back it says if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches so if you have not been trustworthy in handling worthy wealth who will trust you with true riches and we know our lord said that and i believe that is the area of money that he's trying to get to us like this is just worldly wealth something we would think is shallow but he said if you can't handle that who who and he's really talking about himself that i won't trust you with these true riches and we know we know that statue of a perfect man those are the promises those are the true things that we're after by his grace he said i i won't trust you with those things if you can't handle this life thing and i always think of um you know hearing brother dale and you know talked about you know back in the in the early days when he said hey you know a lot of the message people they weren't going to make the rapture you know and that was a shock here in that you know because i hadn't heard that before like wow you mean back then someone was saying that a lot of people not gonna make it not that they're not born again not that they're not saved you see but they won't make what's promised in this age that rapture why because they're just doing the same things that has always been done and i believe it's the same thing if we don't know how to handle money we're going to live our lives we're going to take out loans we're gonna borrow money we're gonna try to pay it back and we hope when we end perhaps it balance out or hey your kids will deal with it when you're gone that's kind of how we approach it like hey let's just see what happens let's go around play but god and his bible have these principles already laid out so isn't it amazing if we could apply these principles then that gives us the opportunity to see what god can do in this small area just to give him an opportunity to see what he can do in this area that we can then say wow lord if you can do this with something so small what can you do with these things that you're promised to me lord god that's what i want to see i want to have that opportunity to experience that in my lifetime which by his grace i have seen some of that i've seen him work in miracles through the principles that i have applied through this financial jubilee again you know we will never be effective with money or again to see that opportunity to see what god will do in this small area same principles i said apply in the statue of a perfect man that's what i hear when i hear the word i can apply it the same way so again we don't want to miss out on this small opportunity to see what god will do and then apply it to those true riches because i believe by that you were going to and this is the promise of this hour we're going to experience something that has never been experienced in any age before any age but the same thing within your family you can experience something that the world hasn't experienced just in this small area of finances and i believe god can do that so we're gonna just run through the principles once again that i brought out before and it's eight principles the last principle is contentment and we're just going to focus on that a little bit more in this sunday school lesson but principle number one remember god's own at all he owns it all the 10 tides are his and the 90 it's it's all his we pay the 10 and he allows us to use the 90 but it's all his so we should be praying when we have that 90 percent lord what would you have me do no it's not a stressful thing it's not a worrying thing we go we know we need to buy food we know we need to plan we know we need to do all those things but it's his so he said lord is it if it's okay with you lord i'm gonna do this as lord if it's your will let me do this the 90 but we don't squander we don't waste we think about what we're doing because it's all his two manage his resources sources diligently get organized we have to diligence is key you know and that's one thing about i think teaching an attention teaching ministry you can see it takes diligence i mean yes it's lesson after lesson trying to get it into us but those lessons that should be applied to our life daily you see so we see you know brother wade is on lesson 59 you know we're on financial jubilee number four but that's just us presenting that's just me talking about it but you got to go in your daily life and now apply it you see what i'm saying so if i've been living i'm 44 years old then by god's grace you know i should be diligently applying that year after year word after word word after word every day diligently being organized thinking what about what i'm doing and if i can't be organized and diligent and maybe i need to slow down slow down just a little bit you know that's one thing i've enjoyed about the word here is just slowing down taking your time making sure we're getting it making sure there is no room no excuses just presenting it slowing it down and that's what happens when we're not slow we can't be organized you got receipts flying over here this happened over there this you know i'm borrowing money from here trying to do that you know that's what i used to do you know when i started out out of college man i thought i was a wise smart dude i'm telling you i could borrow from this person to borrow that person to pay back that and try to make a little interest in between that's what i was doing like yes this is only two percent i'm gonna pick this card i'm gonna do that card did that for years and didn't have a dime right money was moving but i had nothing but when i started slowing down i said you know what i've been working for 10 years and i have like nothing like i don't have anything and his word says you know there's oil oil in the house of the wise you know and i'm like i don't have any oil so something is just not right why is everything i have coming in going out and i started slowing down getting organized thinking about what i'm spending my money on little things you know before you know it you're spending five and six hundred dollars out to eat a month 800 a thousand or you just don't know so that could be one little small ideas you know what let me just watch what i spent out on eating out you might shock your own self and realize oh that's why i don't have an emergency fund i ate it you gotta take your time money is your time you purchase stuff with your time again you're working your husband your spouse working you're putting in your time then if you waste that you're wasting that time that you have my mind patience learning to wait oh this patience is is so important and i believe that's why the scripture says run with patience run we got to be in action but it's a patient run learning to wait this is one of the keys and of course if we wait on god that gives him the opportunity by his grace next slide number five avoid debt like the curse that's it the blessings of the lord and make it rich and he added no sorrow to it certainly the devil will make a way whatever you want he will make a way and he can find a way to help you and your needs believe me but that's all his tactics to get you trapped up into the weeds trapped up bound down can't be free with the lord that's what he wants to do save winter is coming save a little very very important take some of your money and save some of it there's nothing at all wrong with that you have to do that that's why he said watch that ant winter is coming you know those ants they store up food i was the other day just cleaning up outside and moving some rocks and i moved some rocks and a whole bunch of ants and they had these these white things they started moving around first they were like relaxed but i disturbed their habitat and they started moving so i just sat there and i thought about this scripture i said you know what let me just watch and see what they did man they didn't stop working at all they started moving those eggs started putting them in holes and and just working working non-stop no distraction i didn't send any one of them taking a selfie picture i didn't see any of that going on they weren't comparing each other they were moving and before long all those eggs i mean it's probably like 50 to 75 every egg was moved man i was like wow that is quite amazing so i went up just looked up those eggs like yeah those are they're they're the lavas and they have to protect those young ones so they're moving around and making sure and it's like you know what they're they're thinking about that next generation you know they're thinking about if their whole colony gets wiped out they have put those babies in a safe place you know and i believe wow god thought about that he thought of that he wanted to make sure that he left us that word and i believe that's why it's the voice that we have in this day he left that to make sure from generation to generation here we are we have that same word he stored that thing he protected it because he knew he would need it amen but all that just around the ant you know and that's how we need to think you know we got kids we got young ones we got family members we have to think we're going to get older all of us i'm getting older we're all getting older you know my dad was like the hardest working person i knew period he he could outwork anybody but he's 84 years old now so he knows like hey i can't do exactly the same things i used to do you know and he didn't have that that wisdom at that time you know what let me put away something because i will be older and here we are he's now older you know and i'm looking at that like wow that is something else but here this word of god has always told us hey put a little bit away store something up don't spend all that we have the best investment of course is giving to the kingdom of god it's more blessed to give than to receive by his grace and the amen being in a position where we can do that freely freely by his grace and then contentment oh that's it contentment it's learned it's something you have to apply every day and by managing your resources diligently thinking about financial jubilee you can start learning oh man when we started paying off that debt my family and i met it was the gr it was that was a a certainly a milestone in our marriage in our home because contentment came in oh man just to eat out you know we had to be you talking about diligent i think we had like you know twenty dollars a month to eat out but i'll tell you those burgers never taste better i'm telling you when you did get to go to mcdonald's i mean every fry was like woo my goodness and i love that you know i love that but you eat out every day i'm telling you like i don't i'm tired of domino's pizza you know i'm tired of you know applebee's oh no i can't even that's exactly what's happening and that's in every area of our life you know i'm tired oh the church is it's so slow it's just dragging on oh and then over there the other church is like oh they're so loud i can't hear anything you know i wish they would slow down that's exactly what the devil wants to get us in the place where we're just discontent we haven't learned we haven't set still long enough to learn contentment and apply it in our lives help us lord go to the next slide so again contentment is learned paul learned god will teach you if you apply his principles paul says not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatever state i am therewith be content amen whatever state he said i learned that and we're going to find out how he actually learned that he says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so we're getting a little little hint in what paul is saying that helped him reach that contentment he said because god said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen go to the next amen so i'm gonna go to the next slide brothers it says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain we can carry nothing out and having food and remnant be there with content amen godliness now notice how he says that godliness so he's saying hey we can be godly and we could not have contentment because he's saying godliness with contentment is great gain so with god he's trying to give us these great things you know that's he's trying to beat us down with his blessings if we can apply his word godliness with contentment so by his grace that's what we're trying to share how do i get this great gain in my life of course right after that beat but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you telling us hey god is in control that's it god is in control that's pointing out some of that cure that we have to seek god we have to wait on god we got to be able to put him first my mind you know i was hearing a story about a a uh a single married couple right you know they went into a restaurant and you know you see a single couple and a single well not a single couple a single person and they had their book and they had you know a little latte and oh it just they were so relaxed and feeling so good they're just gonna enjoy themselves with their latte and whipped cream on top and all of that until a married couple walked in and the married couple walked in they were holding hands and look at each other and you know sipping each other's latte and that single person said oh lord you see i'm just so lord that's what i'm missing in my life i just don't have somebody who i can sip latte with and oh lord it's just so miserable lord i'm just so down and out not knowing that the married couple's looking at them like oh man if i could just get a date by myself oh my goodness and read my book that's what it's doing and the devil's just playing a field day on all of us through all of that and that's what it is if we could just get into our own position with god right where you are right where he has placed you and start pulling start pulling for what you need and realizing what you have amen so it's so valuable to guard our commitment amen that's it we crave what we don't have overlooking the blessings that we already have and that's it we got to pause we got to slow down by his grace now as we're kind of nearing time is running out but i'm just going to kind of leave you with with this piece of it see contentment and i want to make sure i think this is a very very important point go to the next slide go to the next see it's really important because now contentment is different from being indifferent and different means like i don't care like i'm you know it doesn't matter to me what kind of car i have doesn't matter you know my car is not running it's breaking down i'm still okay you know i'm just satisfied no no no no no that that's that's different you know brother brennaman liking that to a bum that bum that came to his house and he said where are you going he said well um nowhere so where you been well i've just been wandering around wherever my hat lays that's where i've been he said how long you been doing that well about 20 years he said man no that's no ambition he said our ambition just should be set to higher things that's what it is and god says delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart so it's not taking away your desire you see but it's calling god in the scene of that desire bringing him in being content that's what it means not not caring but having a desire so let's say something for example in the church something in your life something in your marriage something in your finances that it's not working out the way you think it should work out okay now to say well i don't it doesn't matter to me that's no it said lord no it does matter to me father but i know to apply it to wait on you to give you that opportunity lord to move and that's where it's running with patience you see it didn't say you sleeping with patients it didn't say you're sitting with patients it says running with patience so it's having our mindset on lord you have promises for me lord you have promises in the word for me father and that's what i want by your grace let's go to skip to slide 12 for me brothers and we'll finish up with with this scripture i think this just kind of answers it at all how to learn contentment starts off be careful which is anxious for nothing well but it was some things what about my marriage what about my church what about my car no for nothing what about my job what about the pastor what about the answers that i need in my life should i be anxious about no be anxious for nothing be anxious for nothing he even has that before prayer get your anxiousness out put that to the side because you approach god and you're anxious you're just telling god what you want you're not ready to listen you're not ready to be patient you're just telling god this is what i lord i gotta have this i was like well the lord like well you're you're telling me you know no get that anxious anxiety be anxious for nothing slow down but in everything now by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving now you're saying you're seeing some of the tools prayer bring god into the situation with supplication there's humbleness a humble request with thanksgiving lord god let me think about what i'm thankful for in my life oh my if you can just think of those testimonies and things in your life where you just took enough time to thank god to thank god for his blessings in your life bring him in through prayer through supplication with thanksgiving then let your request be known unto god in the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus amen that peace of god to keep your mind amen passes all understanding so it's bringing you back don't lean on your own understanding don't lean on your own understanding as you wait on the lord in this small thing of financial jubilee if you're asking the lord for something in regards to money and finances you're saving for something don't lean on your own understanding give him an opportunity to move long as you're doing what you're supposed to do doing the best you know how you can ask you can pray you can get rid of the anxiety and then wait on god again that's just a small area of money but think about everything with the lord even this word as we pray and that lord god reveal more to me you are part of that ingredient and you know what and you know i worked at kfc years ago and um we had to marinate that chicken you know it just didn't turn out right if you just took it out and threw it and we had to actually marinate and put in the freezer so some things take time they take time and god is waiting on us to just to get just right when we're ready and that's that marination that says waiting on the lord letting his peace come into our heart as we wait on him we're still taking our request to him we care about the things that god put on our hearts to care about and we're waiting on the lord amen and the peace of god which passes understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus amen so it's a little bit on contentment of course this is so much more the musicians can get ready to come up certainly god bless you all you know apply these things to our life as we walk this journey as we walk through this word again this is just a small thing that we can take every day to apply it to get that same discipline that we need to get into that deep water the same discipline in this shallow water we can take it into the deep areas amen and be ready for what god has in them for us in this hour
