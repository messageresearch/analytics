the Lord would bless them in this keeps in mind remember all the sick ones because we believe it by stripes were healed now he said that he was sent His Word and healers so if we believe it accept the word and if something revealed to you I've always tried to tell you that's the way I deal the way I do if something is made known to me then immediately I claim my blessings to go with that whether it be my family or whether it be the opening of the word to further degree whatever right when he's revealing to you is the best time to talk to him about the things that he promised so remember those times all right father we thank you for the day in the time and we just ask you to be with us tonight in your love and let your understanding be with us remember the sick ones among us you promised us that you'd send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction and we thank you guide us and keep us Lord in your grace and Lord just let your light shine forth and to all of our hearts over brother Mike Larry Lord and be with him all these troubles and things and just touch each one got us all by thy living grace we thank you for all things in Jesus name you mean we go to Galatians I mean to Ephesians 2 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God what are we talking on a growth development in Christianity right go now let's go over to Galatians 4 and I say that the air as long as he is a child there was nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors if you go back up above there you'll find us called it schoolmaster all right until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ Jesus you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now what I want you to think on I want you to think on something as a point that will be trying to make it miss this message and then when we get back and pick up on what it is I believe that the Bible is the Word of God now we all believe that but now what I'm wanting you to think about that it's written by how many 50 60 writers I forgot him in they say that was that it's written by different writers throughout the Old Testament throughout the New Testament different writers but all of those writers were speaking about the same point or thought no in that marvelous it doesn't matter what you read it's the plan of redemption you read in the Old Testament it's the plan of redemption you read where David killed Goliath that's the plan of redemption that's that was a sent forth you know to help the people to guide where Moses was leading them out to take them to the promised land all of the Bible being written by mankind it all ties together to reveal Jesus Christ now right it is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation showing God and his ways and what he had done and as we were reading here that God sent forth his son see this happened that happened this that brought into being to her that it would reveal Jesus Christ to each one now here's my thought it's an odd thought but you'll get back to it in a minute what if all you had was what Peter said you know what if that's how you had you get the point when I'm driving what if you had only what Paul said they'll get the point we'll illustrate it throughout the message you'll see that Peter and Paul were saying the same thing but Paul carries the thought into a much deeper meaning and brings out things that Peter did not speak about but now he was speaking of the same revelation but not the depth or the thought of the Apostle Paul even - Peter said that people say that Paul said things hard to be understood there's some rationale to their own destruction you know by not understanding it all right now so what if you had though what Paul talked you know now that would be a great understanding to have what Paul taught a great opportunity to hold and and cherish what if that's all you had see then you'd have Paul talking about change the moment at wink of an eye a great understanding a great thing to bring forth but just remember he never attained to it right the follow the point don't get lost in into jangling up all of what you think I'm talking about just listen to I'm talking about all right the if you had-even what Paul had said it wouldn't be enough if you had Peter what he said wouldn't be enough you got John what he said James Timothy you know whatever to isolate our whatever to pull apart and not have all of the word but we're in the end time that we're supposed to have the entire Word of God right now seize the opportunity so remember that point now that if Paul had brought forth all he brought but it still wouldn't be enough you said well why do you say it wouldn't be enough it didn't make it his prophecy was of the future most of Paul's riding spoke into a later day a later time a time to come we'll get into the scriptures after a while he talked about this mortal change into immortality but he never attained to it alright see then by doing that you can see why that we had to have even if you took night let's play don't down get it real strong now huh even if you took all of the writers of the Bible I are you listening all of the writers of the Bible and what they wrote and their their revelation of God you realize it would still wouldn't be enough oh you're sure funny I love it though sometimes it does match real good but you know stops thing with me you see then you would be left without the prophet of Malacca for to be able to give you the perfect interpretation now that's what he said now Paul never said he had perfect understand it Luke was the best he come close enough he said having perfect understanding well yet we know Luke wouldn't a impossible I mean wouldn't a prophet in time all right let's see do you understand what I'm driving it without brother branham to come along to take whatever it was brought to us no matter if you had everybody and we have everybody right we have whatever body has talked now not everybody in the whole thing but we have the Bible has taught that is spread the Prophet will say as much as man note see then he came on the scene to bring up the loose ends because he said down to the ages even into that he said they was loose ends left and in this messenger would have to take all that and tie together all right see thank God for what we've had what we have delivered under you and I is the most wonderful opportunity there is to think about that God has given us not only the written word and not only given us the opportunity to study all the writers of the word and follow their teachings and examples and revelation but he summed it up by bringing a message or in the end time to take all the loose ends and the Prophet said take it on to the rapture no you don't think like I do cuz I know I'm glad she don't see he says take it on to the rapture well right now there's nothing beyond that right I mean you change the moment wing a lot you're going to be with the Lord the rats are taking place you're going right I mean that's taken up well what about all these in the grave with the great revelation the Apostle Paul had of something that Peter never spoke of you're gonna have to think with it and I because I'm trying to get you to think about something that will be a basic background to try to understand then the statue of a perfect man and what things are and what we have need of where the Prophet says you know that we've got to have these things it's not to just talk about it we've got to have it revealed and made alive in our hearts or what or we're gonna keep dining going by the grave I'm sorry to keep mentioning things but try to make you wake up but see 40 years ago the Lord told me that you heard it over and over and over so it ain't one I've come up with last week some of you been here for 30 40 years you know I said it back then that the biggest portion of people of this message would have to die and go by the grave and I had no intentions or thoughts involved in any of it to D Christianize any person now you've heard that over and over and over then I said to you and see I had no thoughts of thinking about well they're not born again no no my point was one thing you and I are gonna go by the grave if we don't come to the right place in God whether we like it or not now all right and let's see until somebody comes to that position in the word mankind will keep on dying going by the ground that's not the Christian eye that's not saying nobody's a Christian I said that then I said now I'm not saying that they they were no I said they could be born-again believers cuz you look at it look at age and what what is taking a toll upon the people of this message of how old a lot of us have got how death is taking people that's not G Christianizing anybody you think I knew something like that doesn't be smart aleck I can't have it I told you what the Lord told me you said well I don't know where was the Lord enough well that's all right ain't got nothing do with it yeah one of these days we'll find out that'll be all right but you ain't gonna get kicked out of heaven because that you don't believe what brother Dale says cuz ain't never been nothing like that tall around here okay all right now listen to the point then so you could take ever writer we have every writer in the Bible what they said about the revelation of God for their time and all like that whether it be Old Testament speaking of Jesus Christ to come or whether it be the New Testament with Christ being here with us are being over in the New Testament to come forth after Christ coming to bring us to those places see did if you shortcut yourself any work then look what you're doing say for instance you'd say well I believe what Paul said but I don't know about what Peter said whenever to me your shortcut in your own self you're cutting your own throat as the old saying goes because it wouldn't be in God's Word brother Brennan said Peter and Paul talked the same thing but now before we get to the Knights you're gonna find out that Peter never taught the depth of the Apostle Paul cuz that scripture that Paul says things hard to be understood will try to lay it down and and pick up the thought right out of the word and see if that's true or not okay what are you following me we could never come to the complete fullness of redemption without what Peter and Paul taught and this using those two as illustrations I'm talking about what everybody thought now toothiness rate is now that's laid upon the point of believing what this prophet has told of redemption to tell all of the things that mankind had not been able to put together totally and bring it to a complete revelation and bring a church to a place that according to the Prophet he said she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 I'm not fussing with nobody out there on the Internet's and stuff like of what they believe and how they say brother Branham was wrong here a wrong gar that has nothing to do with me I said what I said 40 years ago and I said it tonight I don't care what you can prove how much wrong brother Branham was wrong in all of his life or what he done that has nothing to do with me it's what he has done for me he has brought by way of the Holy Spirit the revelation of Jesus Christ to me now that was where I say that I don't care what you say then you say well brother Branham was this and brother Brandon was that I don't care then when it turned around like that I know for sure that he wasn't this or that and everybody claiming he is there was a human being yes mistakes yes but not in the world show me once mistaking the word and see I told you this 40 years ago I said the day you'll come you won't be just fighting against quotes and things some shaking their head they know I said it that way maybe not was with me them they know I've said it since then enough do you order know what I said that not that you know in other words they're the people of the message they're destroying their own selves the denominations can't destroy us they're not gonna send down this great big thing and kill us all cause we believe a message by William Branham there's no need of it just leave them alone and start doctrines among us let the devil go from church to church till he spreads his his things and you don't need to it you don't kill them anyway right you don't have to shoot somebody to kill you kill their influence and you kill that person and see that's what it's doing with the message of people's do it they're killing the influence of brother brothers lashes because I've seen people do it you have to sit down for you're in you're out you're in school well I believe the probably the problems thus saith the Lord that bright eyes were the problem and then get one little bitty something got a wrong date somewhere that he's supposed to be hunting and they just believe the message don't tell me that person ever had anything don't tell me they had the Holy Ghost in law stick sorry I'm too old I haven't been around too long I don't fall too many battles on that the prophets Edward rejecters may I call him word rejecters where do they go somebody quoted somewhere I won't be me they go to hell word rejecters go to hell they have their reward they'll get what they do and with all of that but you're so sorry for them because they're they were so at one time so much on fire with a word and believing the word and then all at once this one the little thing and here's the other thing I don't get I can't understand it suppose you could prove brother Branham was wrong Super's I'm making a statement so listen suppose you could prove he was wrong why is it that the very instant anybody in this message that has went off the message and saying brother Brown was wrong what's the first thing they do come on they go to cutting their heart wiring their pants go back into the world now where would that be it regardless of what brother Branham is where would that put you and me to go back in you mean you say oh the word says may not cut my heart you know I will do it in one day well well we got to change that somewhere you know believe that why why is that why is it the first thing they do they go back to the world I mean if I was the congregation I'd ask that question they'd be a person brother I was wrong here but running on clay I think would you mind if I say a word why are you now teaching it's okay to cut your heart what's that got to do what brother Adam was right or not you check out all these doctors and see different if it's not solved what I say it then when they come with a doctrine as quick as a doctor gets embedded enough they go right back to the world that ain't even then ain't even common sense ain't no Christianity there at all I don't care what you say you're throwing off oh no no I'm telling it like it is okay now look get my point where we can get into the thought ever messenger the prophet said was to line up his message how I was that they all each one line their mess even in the church edges underline their message with the messenger previous right as to line up with a previous messenger and bring their message all right why because that was the way the word is sprung it's brought word by word line upon line precept upon precept you're a little and are a little I know little here and there it's just brought little at the time it's the way God brings it he brings us his message and all of them will tie together so if you could prove brother Branham was wrong in 90% yet you had a 10% ratio over here from some about it what are you gonna do you see where the trouble is gonna be one day is I'm gonna say this and then acquit you know where the biggest trouble is gonna be when those people face God and God looks down to them and says did the seals open it's all you got to say the seals opening prove the man was right humanely he made mistakes even in the seals he talked a white horse rider wrong well yet he corrected his own mistake are you with me of what I'm talking about see it's got to line up from Genesis to Revelation they gotta line up together it's not necessary that each one will have the understanding tells us the growth it's the difference in the way they're supposed to be ok let's get on with it seeing the message of adoption we talked about previous measurement preaching on how paul was explaining the natural story of adoption and how the son was adopted into the family and using that as how the child of God is brought into the family of God at the new birth and then progresses growth through the development of to comes to manifestation of sons and daughters of God alright see the journey of a Christian is covered in the example of a child how that that child goes through a new birth or a natural baby goes from natural birth and it goes into a adoption on stage over the natural alright now if that's going to line up straight then you're gonna have to line your scripture up there somewhere now here's what we're gonna have to thank for a while they're not you know that in the Old Testament the adopts you know point was cuz I'm talking about what brother Branham said about it cuz that's the way I knowed about it and what a little bit you can read a natural child is born into a natural family that's an example of a child being born into the body of Christ alright a natural child comes to a maturity stage more of its fire how you about that big ol word they come to that point all right but in the Old Testament where does it go any further no we got something here now let's hold on to it in the Old Testament it only went from the natural child being born into the natural family to an adoption 'el stage and come to an inheritance or a blessing whatever when it came to an inheritance but it never went on there's no more time okay keep that thought in mind now that that child when it was born in the family would automatically a child for the family and it went to the state of an adoption on point never went any further because that was the type of the shadow that was the inheritance it received it never received nothing as an example of the resurrection if it is I want it to be shown to me if it is I'll come here and tell you no problem I'm just saying think about the point all that Old Testament would do would pick up and show the child was a child and then show the inheritance to the child it never brought anything else into view hey what if I can prove that Paul went thattaway would we believe it then you'll see brother around saying Peter and Paul said the same thing what about it what are you trying to say brother Dale I'm trying to say one thing you only had two stages in the Old Testament you had the baby and you had the inheritance that stopped the typing because it would have to come to the New Testament to be able to pick that up to carry it any higher and I challenge you to find out Peter never taught resurrection on the statute of perfect man you need to listen well I don't understand what you're trying to get to so let's listen and see maybe the Lord might help us okay Paul when you first started out you've seemed to be holding back but then in the depth of your message as you progressed brother you seemed to go further would that not be scriptural is that not the way the Prophet brought it all right go ahead number one let's read something this is taken from Ephesians for he that descended is same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all in all and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Peter never called it stature okay that we have for to be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now Paul ver spoke off the new birth you know and then the stature of a perfect man the growth development but yet he precedes no further than growth development are we're gonna show what he'll pick up he just keeps picking up and the odd part is who he explains it to might be a little bit amazing when we get to there all right well now Paul you believe that we are we've got to come to the perfecting of the science where I've come to the basis of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ they will henceforth be no more children okay now Peter did you teach that like that if Paul the Peter Thomas signs I now Peter did you teach it like that okay go ahead to number two second Peter one in 108 one day Simon Peter served an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith we'll get back to that okay right rotor run said they had that same faith all right with us through the garage system of God in our Savior Jesus Christ in other words Paul had to sign faith Peter had Peter had the same faith Paul okay grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of garden of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world talking to a born-again or about a born-again believer Bible watch and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue the virtual knowledge the knowledge temperance temperance patience places godliness guarding this brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now the next verse after then you might ought to read it verse 9 cuz it says this he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and I've forgotten he was purged from his old sins that's what the Bible says okay now aren't into this into what I'm saying Paul you took it and brought a birth in Ephesians to the Ephesians and you brought it into manifestation as we'll call it which he called it the stature of a perfect man just four four points of our understanding he brought it to teaching a manifestation of sons and daughters of God Peter goes to his message the in Peter and he teaches the stature of a perfect man and he brings it up and talks about but love but he could never come into that because the probably said the headstone didn't come all right now pilot Peters both saying the same thing they got two things in mind number one they got a new birth a child of God like the Old Testament a child born into the family then they've got an inheritance the child the Old Testament got an inheritance but it stopped there because nothing else was mentioned of resurrections or anything to the Old Testament because that was not meant to be it was meant to be in our day in time all right see Peter Cullen Paul comes along takes it up to the stature of a perfect man you don't mention the change you don't mention the redemption of the body Peter comes along comes to the new birth they look like precious faith and he brings it up through a growth development out into the stature of a perfect man but he stops even if you want to talk about the headstone but he stops prior to the resurrection in that odd or is it odd that you're exactly fitting the Old Testament example baby majority Peter baby maturity Paul baby majority now Paul does a marvelous thing then he picks up his talk and he goes to the Romans with his thought watch him come up and he just keeps traveling he never stops he just keeps advancing watch it now you get what I'm saying the Old Testament you had the advancement for one cop of a child and inheritance Paul you had it in a child and inheritance Peter you had a child inheritance it didn't bring out the redemption of the body at that point but now let's listen to the Apostle Paul as he comes back and takes it home let's go to number three on you which is Romans eight as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God okay children born into the family and you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry I thought the spirit of adoption it says it's this holy spirit to adopt us into the family to make us children make us sons and daughters of God right come on now the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ what a wonderful place Paul puts it if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now he's right to the point of him where he was when he started in Ephesians 2 the stature of a perfect man he's right where Peter brings it up through faith virtue knowledge temperance place they don't know that's the same pleasure then the Apostle Paul doesn't stop where the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him with subjected the same in hope because the treasure itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God well we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves even him where he was in his standings he stood in a great position we'll look at it even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body now watch what you've got you've got the Old Testament Saint Old Testament people with a baby and an inheritance you've got Paul and Peter both starting off as a new birth and bringing it to manifestation of sons and daughters of God our stature of a perfect man Paul and Peter both now Paul takes it on he carries it on to redemption of the body you say well that doesn't mean anything to me but it sure does to me it sure means a lot to me because that little word are waiting for the adoption to wit means to understand or to know you've got many meanings of it as users in eleven or twelve times in the Bible of wit and it's used you know for smart in this search use for them but the main thing to me is to a Christian is what to adoption to understand if you think that ain't correct I'll be glad to read it to you we're in the Old Testament the Hebrew word is to know to know to know learn to know to perceive to perceive and see that's the word we'll find out and all the things the New Testament Greek is to make known declare certify give to understand to make known to become known be recognized to know to gain knowledge of that choice to understand coming to an understanding that now there's a bodily Redemption involved now he's come into a resurrection he's coming to a place to talk about a third stage stage one baby born into the family Stage two manifestation statue of a perfect man playing stage three now we're at the redemption of the body with the same messenger bringing it yet he keeps going to grope development if you don't read brother runs the message out of way or listen to you in bad shape anyway because he looked like back here he's he just looks like he ain't getting in there just right and he keeps on going and the next time you hear him bring that message he goes up brings a little higher then the next time you hear it it takes a little higher next time you hear the state it just keeps raising why because he's getting understanding all right now Paul you come to the redemption of the body no did you say any more about this in your writing did you talk any more about the things that are dire that we could take an example of and be able to follow okay go ahead and number six and immediately look at who it's to it's not to the Galatians the Ephesians it's to the babies in Christ the Corinthians because he knows that's his height that he can go he has taken it to the Ephesians and Galatians and they understand that he's reached the point of talking about the redemption the resurrection in other words we'll put it that way but remember now before you can take what we'll get to in a minute we're talking about changing the moment Winco and i just remember you've got to have the dead raised in first right before you talk about the change on so Paul what are you doing well I've had an opportunity I'm talking now to the Corinthians and that's called the book of Corrections brother Brennan said that Paul had more trouble with the Corinthians than anybody he said there's just a bunch of babies but he said that's the way we were right remember what we sprang another day ever born-again believer starts as a baby okay now let's read this some man say how are the dead raised up Paul you're gonna start talking about the dead being raised you haven't spoken of this to the Corinthians you only mentioned it to the Ephesians and the Galatians what are you doing are the dead raised and what body do they come in that this sensibly the baby Corinthians we don't know Paul said something about isn't it but what's it going to be are we gonna play it raised up this way he's looking raised up that way babies they get their doctrine and ideas it's like the believers and this message is done okay you know look what he says thou fool that was our source is not quickened except it da he said now listen to me I'm gonna explain to you the resurrection I'm gonna explain to you the dead and then I'll get to the resurrection to come forth that was our source the source not the body this shall be the bar grain it may chance of wheat or whether the grain know yourselves just a natural into the spiritual right listen well God giveth to the body as it hath pleased him and to ever see this own body our flesh is not the same flesh but there's one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts and another fishes and the birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another you have natural bodies spiritual bodies you have the natural terrestrial and then you have the celestial which is spiritual body which is so theophany etc you know coming for this there is one glory of the Sun another glory of the moon another glory of the stars the one star different from another and glory so also is the resurrection of the Dead ooh it is sown in corruption now it does not mean that it's sown in sin it says in corruption in other words the body is going to corrupt are you with Paul the body is going to corrupt not that it's a sinful body okay now you follow me in this song in this honor oh it's your raising in corruption it is sown in dishonor oh that's what its gonna do it's gonna be changed it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory because it's a dishonor to the fact that we and I should never had it we shouldn't had to die to start with that's a dishonor to the whole human race we went after so much sin until we wound up having to die for come on it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last man Adam was made a quickening spirit first man Adam was made a living being the second Adam which is Jesus Christ right now come on wasn't made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual so you see which way is coming the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord from heaven as is the earthy so are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly sort they also that are heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthly earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren watch him that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God flesh and blood cannot inherit that's why you've got to be changed but it's this body change it's not this body throw it away and burnt now they help but see come on are you right flesh and blood came in hurt the kingdom because it's got to be changed it's got to go by the grave gotta come out gotta beat you now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery now he just got through set up here all's got to die all the lives got to die come on blessing blood Canaan hurt the kingdom all that's died in sin cannot be in glory in that state are you with me you don't go to heaven with a sinful body it's got to be changed but you don't go there with a different body cuz it ain't change that much it's change from one state to the other there was behold I show you a mystery now he's fixing to explain to the Corinthians that they're not all even if they're dying they're not wrong or not in bad shape right he's fixin to explain that if they dive that don't mean it's wrong with no problem listen to it I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep which we shall all be changed until there comes a point of a change of the body you and I are going to keep dying but it don't mean we're dying in in corruption we're dying in Christ because there's no in corruption in anything in Christ right then what well we should all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed so it's not gonna it's not a bad thing if I die don't worry about it I've always made the comical part about it and always said it oh is this said if I died this told me I don't side rope I won't have to worry about digging myself out later he said that's silly not a silly but that's this way I am ain't worried about it because this here is going to follow what's inside of here marry a future home the body is reading let's know the soul is redeemed 49 soul is redeemed you're waiting the redemption of the body that's what we're all doing right now wherever one waiting the redemption of the body right come on I hope we'll get to that point in a minute but it'll slip away for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality it's got to happen it's gonna come forth it can't be come forth in a wrong thing you ain't gonna raise up a they ain't gonna be limbs missing and in parts gone and things like that but you're gonna have the same body you said when I live I got a limb missing so when I get there I'll have a limb missing no that's what Paul said it's not gonna be that away it's going to be changed but this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality now resurrection Paul something Peter didn't explain Peter I'll get to it later Peter and Paul says the same thing Paul tells you scripturally etc encouraged you through the lining up of the scriptures Peter takes you through the gaining of that point of the virtues into display right now come on for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption when this dead that goes by the grave this rotting thing that goes in the grave yeah when it's brought forth changed it stands again on earth watching so when this see and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that saying cannot be brought to faisal until somebody gets to a change in resurrection and all comes back but look ice has written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting grave words I victory a sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law in other words we die we thought if everything goes but thanks be to God which give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be a steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your Labor's are not in vain in the Lord Paul takes it in the illustration the Old Testament takes it from a baby and the natural story puts him into the family he comes forth as an inheritance part but that ends his journey part because he's only topping that much Paul and Peter both pick it up in the point of the newborn baby born into the family and the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God going into the stature of a perfect man but at those stages they don't mention resurrection you know why cuz they don't have the resurrection message you say right now wait a minute let's don't misunderstand me there you hold on to what I'm saying see this message is the resurrection message because this message does what no the rest of them could do remember remember now remember the story what a broad eye that everybody in the Bible what they've taught has got to tie together they can't be contrary one to the other they've got to interlace each other to bring forth the revelation of Jesus Christ whereas one brought it up so far the other one takes it home whereas this one shows it in an example this one carries it home right he's in Old Testament goes from a baby to an inheritance Paul picks it up Peter picks it up it goes from a baby born into the family to a rightful inheritance of the new birth coming forth in manifestation of sons and daughters of God Romans 8 then Paul says okay we've got this going so far now let me continue on and he covers to wit the understand the redemption of the body then the Corinthians questioned him he spent a lengthy process of explaining what death is it's taking you away it's in corrupt you know it's its incorruptible I'm excuse me its corruptible death brings corruption but he says now through Jesus Christ we go to in corruption we go to in corruption because his body went through right just remember we've got some more to go so hold your point remember Jesus went through death burial resurrection change ascension we still got a lot to go yeah we've only got about three stages working on am i right I know I used to believe I used to believe that nobody had ever because the Bible says no man had reached immortality but Jesus Christ and I even put Jesus Christ to the basis that you had never been brought to the correct point I'm just kidding I'm not telling you what the Lord spoke to me one day cesky Ryan the Lord Jesus went through death he's got a face every one of these things for you and me death resurrection change ascension what was the other battle everyone out there someone death burial he went through death burial resurrection he faced every one of those things and conquered every one of them okay all you and I got to do is just keep following the plan just keep following the plan keep walking in the word God will give us the answer to all kind but remember it'll be in the world who would have thought now honest I'm telling it like I'm sorry I just human but who would have thought the Corinthians is the one's Paul was explaining it to little Adam said in the Ephesians they had tongues and interpretation he said but it didn't have to be explained to them Corinthians that over and over about tongues and interpretations and gifts like he said the Corinthians had him I mean the seasons had him in order of Galatians one of the two he said they had him in order they were tutored and trained and they came forth walking in the word this message has the answer to all things and everybody's waiting on you and huh the because this is the day this is the time but they're waiting on you and I a change of the body let's see the resurrections got to come before the puck those that are alive and remain she'll be changed so resurrection is our next point and we're about rapturous change we're about to Resurrection those resurrections next in the order of events goes resurrection and then change and ascension we go to meet him in the air but he's done been through all these things so he knows how to go what all we got to do this let him take over in our hearts and a lot come on musicians I hope you listen to what I'm saying I wish you would go back home and sometime this week we listen I will two or three times because I want to make sure I'm saying it right I'm trying to the best of my knowledge to be able to say things in a correct way to word that we can understand if I'm not saying it the right way you come tell me no I don't mean come to me I don't like your attitude you said this and you said that don't fool with me on attitudes cause me and you both gonna get into an attitude battle cuz you're gonna bring up my attitude and I'm gonna bring up your attitude but what good is that gonna do it either one of us I'm talking about walking in Christ to be better than later the Lord to walk in the Lord understand again 604 604 up into the water and abend baptized I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb big change from the
