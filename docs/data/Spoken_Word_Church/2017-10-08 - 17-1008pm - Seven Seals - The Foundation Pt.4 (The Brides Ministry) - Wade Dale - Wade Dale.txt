morning before we get started you need to watch Rhimes sunday-school class this morning because part of it will be what we're going to talk about today and and really last night brother Joe Cantor didn't know the question that he asked about the fivefold ministry I had been teetering with with there was a gap in the brother Darrell nose won't tell me there's a gap that was a gap between here and going to revelations 5 and I was trying to fill that in and and last night we got it filled in and then Ryan just came in and and almost filled it in I told him I was gonna take about 10 minutes of introduction and then let him finish for what he was saying this morning but but it's good that we got a ministry that flows good together so that that's really good we know that that's the Lord cuz you know we don't sit and have meetings and discuss what we're gonna preach you know so we know that it's the Lord leading and it kind of gives you like brother branham it kind of gives you a confirmation that maybe we are heading in the right direction when when everybody's kind of you know going in the same way so let's turn revelations 10 and let's finish today we're going to have part for the foundation then we're next Sunday we're going to go into revelations chapter 5 but today we want to fill in a little bit of a gap here before we do so let's bow our heads before we get started dear Lord Jesus we pray today Lord them number one that you'll give us a revelation that you will settle us and keep us right here for this appointed time that you will not be just a visitor that you'll be the active participant in the service you take over Lord and your will be done now outside the reigning and all these things Lord we pray that you'd just be with us take care of us Lord be with our homes be with all the cars and the things Lord that are outside with all this rain coming down hard and heavy that everything will be fine and and everything will be for your honor and glory Lord we pray that you'd heal the sick that's among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction I pray this you'd be with the missionaries on the foreign fields finally give them fruit for their labor bless the ones that are not here Lord take care of them be with the ones that are on the highways traveling be with them Lord touch all the little bride around the world father just give us this day today our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen revelations 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the Sun his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open that's what we're getting into there were Revelation chapter 5 but we got one little point we got to cover here and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar then when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not in the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mists of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets now let's read Ephesians 4:11 what we were talking about last night in the Bible study seasons 4:11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all now that's going to be till we all right see what this is till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and we may get into that a little bit today that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive and we see that happening all you know around around the world now not just in the message but everywhere but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now what roll it back down this is the two part go back the other way right there all right look the knowledge of the Son of God now who's the headstone headstone the son of man mm right so we we have a part here that we play and then we have a part here you see the onion peel you see that we break him back to layer speaking the word in truth may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ which is the son of man now he built his church on the Son of God revelation will short - in a minute back down through the church ages and they were people that came to fruition because remember the faith of the father's is here so they had all these virtues working in their life that's not something new brother Brian didn't preach statue of a perfect man it was all a new revelation it was an updated version of what Paul and Peter had already experienced 2,000 years ago and then what was he doing though brother Branham was turning us back to what to where we can get to that mmm tweaking we can get back to that but speaking the truth in love may grow up and do him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and I like this word compacted when you compact something you don't build a foundation I was reading the other day that was talking about the Key West where they were had a lot of sand they drilled down till they get to coral they keep building on that sand they drilled till they get to coral rock and then they what they compact that thing and then they what build their buildings own well that's what I see here that God is now compacting by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love you may be seeing the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word but I like that scripture just continue reading because most of us preacher stop on he gave some apostles prophets and we have to verify our office I don't think we have to verify our office hey man I think God's one that verifies the office that's wondering when you're gonna bring it brother Bob came all by you from Mobile Alabama to bring me that water today he was supposed to be in mobile preaching today but but Nate McFerrin went down and say that okay but Nate yeah that's right he's learning Nate is in the back learning so Nate come flying through here and he's the cause of all this weather so y'all can whip him when you see him so I'm allowed to say in churches listen let's get our get a foundation again now this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelations 10 7 is gonna do two things now I'm gonna keep repeating it so you can understand that he said there was two things that he was supposed to do all right not not someone that he said one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's no we were talking about that the other day children what Pentecostal babbling babies back to this faith of the what early Pentecost not Pentecost 1906 not Pentecost not 18:12 we're talking about Pentecost back in a t-33 30 80 30 we see that that's when the Holy Ghost came and fell on what sons of God and they were what they'd already been tutored by God for three and a half years God himself in human flesh tutored them for three and a half years amen so the word fell on what they held and we're going to talk about that later on today because if the first church age matured that way the last church age has got a mature that way man because you got you alpha brian omega bride you've got everything in between but the Alpha Brian and Omega bride had so much in common because God was restoring back in Malachi he was restoring us at the end time back to the faith of what the foundation of the Pentecostal fathers alright but that was the foundation to grow upon like we were talking about here in Ephesians 4 that started our growth development when you got born again you just you just didn't become full grown in God all right you had to start as a baby you fell you got up you made mistakes you cried daddy daddy and in romans 8 as we've as we've been through many times before but according to my account for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's too he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 that's what we're getting ready to get into which are the revelations contained in the seven seals like we said times before for those of you they weren't here this is the seal this is not the seal this is the seal this is the seal that had this sealed okay and this was sealed so nobody could see what was inside okay so the seven thunders of the revelations contained in the seventh seal so when the seven seals break God will be able to speak or Thunder out a voice that will bring us revelation because revelation was sealed up you said no no yes yes man's sealed this thing up the look the founding fathers never taught that father son Holy Ghost was a baptism so who did that come from the devil that had this thing sealed amen done all right so he he had that thing sealed where we couldn't see it but this endtime messenger promised us listen this is our inheritance today if you're a child and daughter of God today I am reading I am the attorney that's reading your will of your father that died to leave you something it is not just baby form justification baby form sanctification baby form baptism my Holy Ghost we're talking about the headstone we're talking about mature people that you know you you look at Peter and Paul and they had contention you look at Paul and what Barnabas they had contention it wasn't doctrinal contention though it was misbehaving or a Barnabas didn't want to take didn't think it was time for Timothy to go with him so he said I'm not taking him the Bible said they had so much contention they had to leave so we're not talking we're just talking about personalities there we're not talking about revelation I remember I told you right here in Ephesians 4 speaking the truth in love may grow up in him which is the head even Christ that we be not children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine somebody comes in and preaches this and we believe this they come in and preach that we believe that I'm like brother Ryan said this morning he what he said he was going to be a little bit arrogant Ron bonnet arrogant that's why you need to listen to this because I don't think there's an arrogant bone in his body I think it's just truth because how you gonna hear that's what brother Joe asked last night about the fivefold ministry in them in the Bible study and that's what struck my attention he said it's the fivefold ministry for everybody like out in the denominational world yes it is but there's a there's a group that's predestinated to take me and you to that headstone because there will never a denomination take you to the headstone never will a denomination take you to a headstone amen sorry that's just the way it is my brother branham watch here it's the divinely revealed mystery truth of the seventh church age messenger that will take us on right here literally turn us back it'll be those seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seventh seal it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father is exactly so but consider this also this prophet messenger will be in this nature and manners were Elijah and John the people of this prophet messengers days is that me and you the people of this prophet messengers day now remember if brother Branham said it's gone from you then it wasn't those people sitting in the tabernacle at the time of this they got their truth they got their revelation under the Son of God in the church ages hey man but he's talking about something totally different the headstone the seals that was the only person that had the seal was Christ himself amen then all right Clarence Larkin didn't have the revelation of the seals yet he had an understanding of the seal amen so I brother Ryan said I mean I'm I agree with him 100% these people sitting in this church that's wanting an anointing there's people in this church that wants that wants an anointing on the outside these people in this church wants an anointing on the inside and they some sentient that ain't don't want neither one of them make believers unbelievers and true believers in every congregation and I hate to say that but the prophet of God I'll just quote him he said that but as brother Ryan said which one do you want you want something that will sustain you for 15 minutes or for an eternity you won't 15 minutes of fame you won't 15 minutes of wool or do you want what an eternal soul that speaks back to God then when God speaks that you say yes Lord and it doesn't matter if it comes from me or Reiner brother anybody like sister Rachel asked last night about a prophetess being a woman well yeah we listen to but they're not gonna come back here and preach that's the difference you understand you got your office but God can't speak to women brother Brown said if a woman's got the Holy Ghost said you can listen to her and get something okay man we just have our offices we got to understand there is an office that we fulfil that they can't be in this office like we're talking here right we were talking last night and this is just my belief I don't have a quote for it but brother Branham remember he fulfilled all file offices remember he was a prophet but remember he was a church age messenger prophet he was not this faithful ministry prophet but he fulfilled all five what'd he do he stepped back and gone well God sent him in other words he stepped forward and showed all five offices and how they worked to their perfection therefore we can now take what he says as being the Prophet messenger of the endtime being the head prophet no other prophets if him because you can have multiple prophets in a fivefold ministry but you can't have multiple church agent messenger prophets on the scene at the same time God only speaks to one man but he fulfil remember the the angel said do the work of an evangelist he took him right to the scripture and told him to do the work of an evangelist didn't tell him he was an evangelist but to do the work of an evangelist because it had to come through God to the major prophet into the minor prophets apostles evangelists pastors and teachers that all right say ma'am all right that's why I say it there brother Branham showed us how to fulfill every one of them he was our example but only the children whose hearts will be turned it's only the children who will listen all right so let's continue on we've been reading this number to faith 1953 cuz the one I want to show you a few things on the board and then that'll put everything together and we'll get the Revelations 5 it shouldn't take us too long number two faith nineteenth this is 1953 I'll still like this quote there's a step up coming in the church now brother Owen was talking about he sees things yeah and brother Dale was talking this morning you must see si means to understand you must understand that there is there is something that's that's not going to happen that's happening it's working because remember God what God what does it reveals it and it makes it manifest by the time you see the manifestation God's already been through to two forms of bringing it revealing it and then making the manifest all right so anyway we're in that time of this right here there's a step up coming into church now see these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while some things are moving I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ whom I everyone in our doctrine or in our baptism we come to a place but there's some key that will unlock something here all right so that key you know what that key is your faith that gives your faith your faith in believing that you're hearing the Word of God amen number three let's go to number three here because I want to read this and then we'll then we'll read this other quote that we had last night that I that I pulled up for us to to take a look at questions and answers 1964 first Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid hello this is what Ryan was so much this morning that anointing that you get just a little whew you know then it's over with so all these little things have jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect see I want you to see some if brother branham watch on a tape we were talking about last night if somebody interrupted him and brought a tongue or an interpretation sometimes he would acknowledge it sometimes he never acknowledged it one time why it was not in order Amen it was not in order alright I was looking the other day and and I want us to be sensitive to this and I want to say this with all love you know let the preacher do the preaching when brother Brandon would there was only about four times somebody interrupted him during all those services that interrupted and said something to him and it took him five minutes you can hear him on the tape it took him five minutes to get his spirit back leave it alone you're not the preacher what the preacher up here say hallelujah say man say glory to God but don't try to preach for the preacher you take him out of his anointing you move him over be subject to the anointing that's here I'm just saying that cuz it's not right to do it any other way alright so it says right here same thing these little we shouldn't grow me grow we should be grow we should be grown up and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word will divine vindication then that word since part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things a man I go to preach and then then don't get to these things he's talking about answering questions Oh Matt now let's read number four we were talking about last night brother they asked brother Branham questions and answers on the seals you just heard it just the other day with the Bride of Christ would the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture sure that's what's going on right now see the Bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour so he is he has told us where it was that it's the message of the hour the Bride of Christ sure she's consist of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors of that right that's the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour but it'll be so humble and man it'll be so so humble so now let's read number five and then we'll go back and and make a few comments number five tell me brother tell me my sister when what's the time now look I want to show you something too later on when we start with the chart the messages brother Dale is always bringing out the messages after the seals well I'm going to bring you the messages coming up to the seal because to me that was the foundational important that it was important for him to bring that before he brought the seals because we know one thing's for sure if he didn't bring Daniel 70 weeks and preach it correct then he couldn't preach the seals now he said that himself same way with you and I we can't understand it tell me my brother tell me my sister so he preached in 1960 priests adoption series when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now I'm telling you this is your inheritance I'm reading your well alright when were there ever a time in the history that this manifests the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting that's what's happening right outside this door look at nature we've never had this many hurricanes this time of the year this late in the year and all these earthquakes and all this other stuff that we're going through why is it groaning because we are not where we're supposed to be when were there ever a time in the history that the that manifests the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations it had to wait till this time that's 1960s leading up to the ceiling now look now all these things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until the ministry will be so close like Christ it'll join him in his church together hey man I believe that's where we're right now there's your inheritance if you ever wanted there's your inheritance we've come to the place that that we know we are all in different areas in different different levels but this is where we must end up that is our end result is to get the headstone Christ never preached a false doctrine right Christ never preached a false doctrine did he so if we're supposed to be so much like Christ like brother Ryan said you can call it bragging or whatever you want to he believes that we're in the place we ought to be we're hearing the correct Word of God so you better bleep you better believe that if you don't you need to haul it out of here find something else please me to find something else if you got something else well I'll go listen to the Prophet he just told you to listen to the ministry he just told you to listen the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists all right and if he was sitting here today he would Amen the same thing and then is this the end of the time surge number six we will talk about this and then we'll get into what we're what we're talking about today this has all been background the mystery here is the mystery of mystery of Scripture it is previously hidden truth now divinely revealed we've read this before we're going to read it again but which is a supernatural element still remaining despite the revelation so we've went through and we'll read at the minute where brother Martin talks about it we've went through chapter 7 church ages with like he said the revelation of the Son of God coming down baptism no eternal hell all the major doctrines that we've talked about but remember Paul says we've got to what leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not doing away with it building on it and then building on that foundation taking in sin though did vile Icke that word divine cuz there's only one person divine that's God himself he can only bring divine you and I can't bring divine but God can bring divine but brother mom said these divinely revealed mystery truth so in other words they come from a man they come straight from God Almighty and right here now divinely revealed but which still still after being divinely revealed there's a supernatural element remains under that revelation and to me I believe that's the seven thunders that we're talking about here that all right you believe that if you want to do you know what you don't have to but I believe that it's these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn us back it will turn us back not back to not back to the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale but back to the what the son of God that I was supposed to be my brother Dale is talking about all we're doing is meeting up with what we should have been in the Garden of Eden we're just meeting back up with it and we're not meeting back up with it in heaven we're meeting back up with it right here I told them I'm telling you again I the the one of the greatest revelations is that we don't have to stand judgment that ought to make you happy that we don't have to stand in front of that judgment but everybody all denominations oh we got to go before that white throne everybody's got to stand before that white throne no you don't no you do not why because my advocate has already stood the judgment and if I stand there with him how can I be judged if he's not judged to me that makes me happy to me that's a revelation and it didn't it then there is a supernatural element underneath that then I'm not gonna have to go somewhere to get judged I'm judged right here right here I take my judgment with Christ he wasn't judged in heaven he was judged on earth he took my judgment at Calvary so I don't have to stand it I already been in the hell I've already been in another dimension it's what the prophets in 1st Corinthians 2 verse 7 says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto whose glory here's glory no no no hold on our glory remember brother Brown said we are his victory we are his victory he went to Calvary to pay the price but unless somebody accepts it down here unless somebody what brings that same ministry back here in this dimension it's got to be in this dimension on another one all right which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God has to reveal them but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of God we read this yes that's Sunday for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God so now look we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are what freely given to us of God now folks the seals have been open everything's been given to us the book is open there is no closed book if there's a closed book you closed it if it was a closed book I closed it but that book that we see in Revelations 10 was Christ Himself bringing that open book so that you and I can understand not just words on a page a book is not all words on a page you are living epistles known in what read of all men when you go to Walmart do you show this or do you show the things of the world which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual I'll promise you I can stand here today and give you the commentary of Gemini's 38 years together some of you it would sicken you and some of you it would make you happy but I'll promise if you get in the same spirit of the one that was involved you'll understand it better so if you'll get in the spirit of the one that wrote it I see that more than ever sister Johnny I can't understand this word of God unless Stace the person that wrote it is inside of me same with you you cannot understand sure you can get superficial you can have the anointing like brother I was talking about you got the anointing on your spirit every day your life and dying to bust hell wide open you've said in a message Church sorry you'd be a sanctified as Judas was and still worthy go but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God we're contrary our first life was contrary to this new life that's why they Paul said we listen you and I didn't have a worry in our members before we became Christians we just did what the inside man said but now that we become Christians there's like brother Dale said he never liked beer ever but now that you become a Christian you like why because it's that man inside of you has no one of that but that outside man still has a what a nature that we gotta find and we will fight that thing I promise you we'll win because the one greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world hey ma'am so that's the same way with you and I so look but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned this message even in its baby form is hard for people to understand even though it's plain even though it's something you just read in the Bible because when we read it remember we read it and let don't get me wrong you know when you were a new convert you didn't have the Holy Ghost you didn't have the teacher inside of you but he was so close God knows whether you gonna receive the Holy Ghost or not he knows whether you gonna continue own we see so many they come and they go man this is great this is great this is good this is well maybe it's not for me and then well God knew that he just let the person run the course but you and I but it's like brother Dale said many times of the the one that comes in and sets on the front row and shouts and screams hallelujah it's like a house on fire on a windy day well guess what six months later they just burn right on out but the person that comes in and sets and listens and listens and listens and listens and listens and hangs around for about a year or so I'll give them a little bit of credit hey man because what God's working on people he's working on him he's even working on the ones that don't want him right he's working on he's not he's not just kicking people out he said no come on in come on in sit down listen but one day he'll say you walked in a church and you turned me down so there's the righteous judge all right so now where is this message coming from and going to that's what we're gonna tie everything together just for a few minutes all right so let's go to number seven the breach between the church ages in the seals 1963 brother Graham says until we read this last week and we know this but I'm solidifying the foundation I'm compacting it to keep the crash you know from something falling through the cracks now see the mystery of the seventh seal book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh Church ages church SEP sorry seventh church angels message saying the seventh angel begins to sound and there's the message wrote out there and we got it in tape and book for them he told them right where it was that plain as day but how many people caught that that we're sitting there probably not meaning because of what happened afterwards you look at you look at what happens afterwards because what you'll manifest who you are we're gonna manifest who we are what I said the other day you can you know we can say whoever about whatever but when it comes to manifesting time we will manifest who we are whether we want to or not you will manifest what's inside of you all right so now let's read this right here number eight we were talking last Sunday right here and this is where we'll just bring a few points and then we'll start in Revelation chapter five next Sunday now God has provided and original ways to do things and he'll never do it contrary to that that's why I like about God he's just constant and consistent he's constant inconsistent now he promised in the last days where we at now last day so put yourself in this quote that forty would do and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification there's Elijah hat as you lost your head as John the Baptist head and it will turn the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original apostolate fathers back to the word how these things have been a vindicated how that in the sounding of the last angel revelations 10 and the days of the seventh angel these mysteries that's all been why did the message let's do this in the Baptist in the Church of Christ and Jehovah Witness all do that these mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seven angels seven angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation but you can't do away with the years of preparation no that's your foundation amen but that wasn't his message he come at the end of the age to bring his message he he preached to those baby Pentecost first part of his message to turn them around but that second part was not for them that was the shot that died had life in it before it I don't forget that like brother Owen said don't forget that shot one time had life protected the seed but God moves right on into the seed and the shut drives up and blows away that's what we see now not in the years of preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of it so he he put it pinned it right on him he said you're the witness all right so he says not in the years of preparation now we're gonna draw out here again and want you to see something and keep you awake maybe anyway now remember this is the this is the church ages all right now watch that's the church ages one through seven just like you got up here now what was he doing was and this was that this was a revelation of what son of God we know that on this rock I'll build my church this is the church this is the church he's talking about cuz remember brother Branham a little bit later on he pulls away from calling everybody a church because the church goes through the tribulation the bride don't go through the tribulation all right so the bride has to be called out of these ages remember he put the the black and you know he said the white was what the white was the believers and the black was the unbelievers and and remember the angel blacked us completely out he said I added a little bit of light you know where that light is it's like that comma that William bore the one you know what that light was mark haxon wrong way Dale be Caterson all of you that's the light he put up there because we have received that message everybody does everybody's not going to receive it and the ones that don't they're black they're black and out amen so now we got seven church ages and then we remember we were talking bringing it up as this that's horrible but that was that gap when that was the breech well during that I want you to see that even though that's what I was looking at this morning in birth pains number nine brother Branham says notice quickly now now she is in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in the Laodicean Church age so we're still at listen the way out of seeing church age actually continues on when we're gone if you won't be real technical as far as time continues even into the Millennium but that's not the Laodicean Church age all right time doesn't end until the what till we get to the future home all right but the church age ends when we get out of here and God goes to the Jews and then everything is destroyed that okay because because the church ages to the wise the Gentile all right does everybody understand that so it doesn't stop when we leave we're what we're calling out of the age remember if you'll look at your Daniel 7 do we chart brother Branham draws those little dots that's the church leaving the earth going right to and you know what he does he brings that God and he brings it right to what the headstone because that's what's going in a rapture this is not someone has to come to here to pull all this out to pull all this up to get us to what condition let me tell you something again I'm not looking for a rapture let me put you let me give you let me give you a real good example when I graduated high school I finished really 13 years kindergarten I just I didn't miss a grade kindergarten through 12 then I got a what on that graduation day I got a diploma that diploma says you're finished with this school and don't come back here anymore I didn't go back there the next year I was finished I was what I was called up out of that time but what was the most important that piece of paper or the 12 years I took a school that's your rapture the most important is to what the background the background is your important when the rapture is just an event that happens at the end of your required time on earth that all right say ma'am so to me the rapture sure it's very important I needed that diploma to continue on what I was doing but that one diplomacy I could have this is this is the whole point I could have skipped my graduation they could have mailed me my diploma but I couldn't have skipped 12 years of school and then got a diploma I had to go through those 12 years of school 13 years of school and then they said okay you're ready to go so that's what God said you got to finish this required course then this is what this is a benefit of you taking all of your courses so the rapture is a benefit that we come to a place that we got to get to dead Saints out of the ground first people will not go one place without getting those dead Saints back into this dimension birth pains notice quickly now she's in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in the layout of scene churchy now her messenger is promised in Malachi the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 now many people take that as he changed the way you got born again he can't change the way you get bored again he's a word prophet he had to bring it out of the word right so he couldn't bring out the word that now let's just believe the message of the hour no you still got justification because look in the future home he preaches the three stages completes the birth right justifications thanks for catching us but we're to be delivered of a new birth we get the new birth were delivered from a lot of things but they still some other things that we got to get out remember there's a birth into this there's a birth into this there's a birth into this is the birth into this and then we come up to right here we come up to that gap that we were talking about the breech listen your new birth is not wrong but your new birth if he doesn't carry you known to what the perfecting of the Saints in the headstone according to Ephesians 4 then what you're stuck you're stuck in the birth canal you can't get out never brother Brown said these people in these church ages couldn't get all the way out amen but in this time right here this Malachi 4 message is going to Burke a group of people that's not going to go back to tradition that's not going to go back even to the tradition of 1960s we've moved past not brother branham's message no no no no no but we've moved past that denominational idea that we don't have to all die every denomination teaches you you gonna die right that's why this is not a denomination this is not and will not be a denomination it cannot be denominated because what a denomination binds you it stops you Pentecost was wonderful it stopped what do brother Brahim say God went on the ship dried up why when there's no wife to shut dries up it blows away that's what's happening now we've got people still stuck in the church ages I'm sorry with church age mentality I got a guy I got a list I got a letter we're in the headstone is death Jesus had to die simply for me and you he didn't have to die for itself he died for us he took on CNN so weed it won't happen if we ever get it we don't have to die we've already done we're being delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 bring in what the headstone back into the church listen to this see if you can take this one let's not read that quote yet just hang on men but look now we've come to a place anybody all right say man we got just just 10 minutes we got a gap here right because then you got what you got the headstone because it was rejected in the church ages so he was out of his church ages he was rejected in the church agent remember I got a cot I couldn't pull it up because they don't have the fix back there but write it if there's layout to see in church age he's kicked out he's been kicked out of every one of these Church ages he's standing at the door knocking waiting for us to lady man so in other words he's been kicked out of all my church ages and 90% of the message churches well it hurts but I really don't care not everybody is going to come to the headstone that's just the way it is I'm sorry but you got to have the right teaching to get you to that you can't be stuck in those church ages but look watch 1960 brother Branham preaches the adoption series I want you to watch how God brings this up cuz I told him last night every message brother Branham preached was God sent God ordained and God's one it did the preacher we need all 1,100 sermons to get us out of here so there wasn't that he preached one just to fill in a gap sometimes we preach sometimes and we think well we just fill the gap in today because nobody said they meant but it went to somebody because God's Word won't return void we smiling for a bubble Bob did good job Wednesday night dude laid it out there buddy I mean laid it out there didn't call no names but he should him 1960 watch he preaches what the church ages all right there by all right all right preaches the church ages puts them all in order remember the church age book doesn't come out till later it's a compilation of all the of the seven churches plus the ten virgins and all the other ones that he did he preached all right got that preached Church ages in 1960 I want to get this order down in 1211 so at the end of the year he was preached in 1963 Church ages all right now in 1961 he preached his Daniel 70 weeks in July everybody got that watch he comes through the church ages he said no we got to get these Daniel 70 weeks out of the way no we're still right here we're in that birth canal we're getting ready to be delivered because remember Malachi 4 has two parts the first part and the second part they're by all right first part in the second part now 1961 he preaches daddy I'm 70 weeks he said we got to get these out of the way now watch this in 1962 he preaches spoken words original seeds one of the greatest messages I think he ever preached but what did he do during that message what did he do during that message pulled it up on screen Polk Awards Regency 1962 he preached that in in March so let's put this date down 318 that's March the 18th 1962 he said now look God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi for for this day and Malachi for has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled for it is a germanized Word of God spoken through Malachi the Prophet Jesus referred to it it is the to be just before the coming of Christ the second coming listen close now all scripture has not been yet fulfilled must be before that time the Bible is to be finished to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives now wait a minute he's been on the same for 30 years that's 1962 he started preaching in 133 thirtysomething he's been preaching for thirty years he said as of yet that messenger is not here okay the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible plump from the serpent to the messenger in the form of rain obviously then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefathers John and Elijah as we're spoken by our Lord so on 3:18 1962 god this is the part that God put on his pen to write the Holy Spirit put this on his pen to write as of yet Malachi 4 had not been fulfilled now he had preached what adoption church ages Daniel 70 weeks he preached the seals back in this part of his ministry Tony was finished he was only beginning the Holy Ghost said wait a minute you're not even started your message yet that's what he's just said I'm just reading you what he said thereby alright alright 1962 let's continue we'll be done right here just stuck in 1962 now this was preached in 318 so let's go to 422 1962 he preaches restoration of the bride tree another great message what bringing us what out of the ages that had been eaten he told us this had been eat down this had been eat down this had been eaten out right and it was to be restored in the end time not during here restored during the end time all right then in 1962 now one 1962 was a wonderful year 1962 1014 1962 he preaches that this statue of a perfect man he had to preach that to get us what out of the ages because he had to get us right here return to hearts of the children back to the fathers and then build us up to here 1962 statue of a perfect man 10 14 October actually this month then watch now 1962 12:30 right at the end of the year he preaches is this the sign of the time sir goes out in Arizona fields the blast all that went on and happened and he's wondering whether it's the end time he's wondering is he finished readings is he was he was actually questioning what's up next is this the sign of the time serves he was asking them a question is this the sign what all this inside this gap this breach cuz if you got a breach you can't pass what's that what's gonna happen you got to take these two ends and bring them together amen you got to bring these two and build up what compacted all right watch in 1963 on 318 which is look one year from spoken words original seed to the opening the seals one year exactly he brings this message and that is his message this is our foundation look we had to learn about adoption put the church ages in line put Daniel seventy weeks in line folk and words original seed brother branham your message is not finished son it's just beginning you got you got hey look from 318 1963 to 12 about 20 when he preached communion I couldn't find couldn't look it up that's in 1965 of course he died on the what the 24th right that's three years in nine months that's the three and a half year ministry Jesus Christ there's your message right there that's the message of the headstone so as of yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound you said no no no I'm just telling you what he said we're up here now we got to be called out of the ages you know what we got to do we got a door with a doorknob on our side we either leave it shut and staying here and dying go by the grave or we can open that door and let him in cause he's standing at the door let's stand our feet behold I stand at the door and I'm knocking look at that perfect that ministry just led us right into the headstone and you know what but Larry Christ had to come he had to come during that time why cuz everything was in perfect order just like now people we got to have everything in perfect order and I believe we are getting there to get everything in perfect order to get out of here let's sing a song if you need anything I hope that helped you a little bit maybe because remember a prophet doesn't do anything previously he does he does that's why he's a prophet he does what God tells him today so he's in there and he's studying these preaching spoken word getting ready to preach before its original seed and I'll guarantee you in his human mind he's going I preached this I preached this I brought the Daniel seventy weeks the way it's supposed to be I brought I went behind the curtain of time I've seen the sixth dimension I know where the people are that I'm preaching to if they die know where they're going I preached the church ages and and God's vindicated it by what growing the same thing on the wall what a vindication is histor for God to come down and draw the same thing you drew which it was God drawing it the first time anyway so we would we kind of well know that was brother right in line with God and then to have that vindicated and for us to come to a place now to where we can look back and see that and then we just walk right up them same step walk right up them saying there is no door except what we closed it's all open it's all for me and you to take this message and go right on into eternity with let's sing a song let's sing number 376 in the spiral book the original life God's heaven a buttes were manifested to his bride in this last stage we have caught the revelation by the last prophets message and we know for the original lives the original the original see the original is what I believe the son of mine revealed seven sealed BAM original I the original see we are the word made flesh today this what the scriptures say and our names are seen within redeemed and perfect without sin yes we are anointed [Music] the original the original the original shape the original world I believe the son of mine it's revealed a seven ceiling the original the original leaves thank alas what we are called to adoption gone [Music] sleep whose narrate there is it all the original see the original world it's what I believe [Music] [Applause] the original lies the original say we have been turned back to a place no one has been turned to you and I are standing in an inheritance that no one received God always had an inheritance but there's an inheritance of for you and I to have this second part of of the Prophet where it literally turns us badly it literally takes us out of here not just turn us back we should already be turned by it we should have the virtues working in our life at least some of them that's what I call is the first step but that's not the call today the call of today is the full manifestation of God the full manifestation of the one the headstone know what God says you love Lord and then all minds clear be careful going home I think it's lit up a little bit so just go with God read the breach if you would before next Sunday you don't get time to then we'll still start covering it but to me that was the foundation that that will help us I think as we go through then we'll come back and you'll know why brother Brown did some things see that's that's what I like about God if God can reveal it brother a if God can reveal it to me and the illiterate person really illiterate in the gospel I've been preaching but you know 15 years I'm not somebody's been preaching for thirty years and no ever closed during that's but if he can take somebody literate Percy brother a he's been in the message a long time but God still he still being what inspired he's still being what changed and something comes away and you go pan well you know what that does that gives me fuel for a little bit further then I get fuel for a little bit further and fuel for a little bit further so God bless you we got a fivefold ministry that works we got each one of you all of us together song leaders musicians you know if it if it's if it's better somewhere else let me know but I like it right here so the Lord bless you let's let's pray before we go the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you'll go with your people take care of them on the highway the Lord just bless them be with them during this week just not let our power go off or anything happen with the wind and trees like you did before father we pray this you would just steal that we need the rain Lord but we don't need all that other behind it just be with each one Lord sanctifies for this journey as that's when the children of Israel were getting ready to go across the other side they there was a group that had to be circumcised there was one last group before they went across that they had to be circumcised before they went across and Lord we pray that you'll circumcise our heart just take those things away from us that we don't need Lord to give us a refill and give us that new birth from according to Malachi 4 that we can take this thing and sweep it onto the coming of the Lord just be with us now Lord to take care of us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things a man you're dismissed god bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
