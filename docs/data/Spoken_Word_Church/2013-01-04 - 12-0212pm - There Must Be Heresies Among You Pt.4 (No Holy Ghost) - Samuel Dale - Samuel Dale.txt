turn back where we've been reading from First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. really enjoyed the singing I think we have some of the best singing musics and musicians and singers in the in the message maybe I'm a little prejudiced on that one we do and I really appreciate you guys you know we could just find a good preacher we'd be doing all right we'd never think of when when amen I got this the thing and I wanted to if you want to read it you welcome to it from Brother uh Nestor to show you kind of you know where things are going uh we send money to the Philippines damn they brother um but anyhow he he puts it out brother Vernon to the different ministers there and it's travel expenses and stuff like that you know and that's what we've developed in that part of doing is to try to help some of them go to the different places now brother Nestor Ashley NoDa now that's not brother narcissus now brother narcissist is on the other end of of the Philippines but he's he just made a trip and going to Thailand laosha Vietnam Cambodia and all and he sent back a missionary trip because that's what we have support if you want to look at it you're welcome to it you know to see some of the places that your money is going right to help the gospel because that's where we used to try to build churches and help do things and all like that but we brought it down to where that we can just maybe help somebody go out amen and take the gospel to somewhere else and we really appreciate these brothers doing and doing and you know what you have a part to do with it because your money that's sent in there and it happened so we you know if you want to look at your welcome to it amen First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. remember the fellowship meeting be the third Saturday in March be on the 17th minister to be announced later and then there will be a the banquet coming this Saturday night starting at six o'clock and be there to have your pictures taken and we will begin eating about seven o'clock and Wade will be speaking unto us during that period of time so just come and have a good time all of your that signed up and everything and I know some of you couldn't come because of different things and that's that's understandable we have we just have us a good time with our sweethearts we appreciate our wives and everything and so We Gather in honor of them and have a good time just sitting around you know talking and fellowshipping together and just have a good time in the Lord amen let's just spray before we read our scripture the heavenly father we thank you Lord for the day and thank you for the time that we have thank you for being you Lord and that you would come and dwell among a people that are not worthy because we we know that there's nothing within us that we know there's one thing you promised it we thank you for keeping your promises we believe that they're yea and amen just have your way now as we read your word and talk about these things and the the thoughts and doctrines among some of the people of the message we're not trying to condemn nobody but to try to make sure that we don't follow after some of those things unknowingly because it would be very easily to fall into some traps and things and not know the real truth but we thank you that you're the truth and you gave us the Holy Spirit to be able to divide out these things and to know what is truth and what is not true we love you and we thank you have your way now and guide us in Jesus name amen First Corinthians 11. 18 19. for first of all when we come to when you come together in the church I hear that there'll be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be must be also herishes among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you see now that's the God will show who will stay with the word and who won't okay okay first Peter 3 15. but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asked you a reason and a hope that is with is in you with meekness and fear you may be seated blessing to the reading of the word now I hope you 've done as I said we try to do on each time is to remind you that some of these doctrines that we're covering um have been around a long time and uh pray that you would just understand that what we're trying to do is to just show you what we believe and what we don't believe in it that way we you know a church without a Doctrine it's not a church so we we just stand on these things and see them and there's so many uh when I mentioned something like I'll call out something like we've covered uh now the uh the point of the two Souls the two Lords the River Jordan and this morning we were on the seven Thunder virtue uh point and uh you know in doing that I know that there's different variations different groups and things around the country that say that I don't believe it that way I believe it this way you know and there's doctrines of that order and all brother Aaron was brought it to my attention on one that um you know there is a Doctrine among some of the people mentioned or used to be really about the seven Thunders that actually the seven Thunders were seven men you know and I remember the names or two or three of them but they believed that they were seven men you know that had the you're supposed to follow those seven people well uh I hope you understood what I say this morning and that would correct that point because I believe what the prophet had to say the Thunder's the voice of God Amen when the seal breaks all right now we follow anyone that follows the truth right man because that's the point and as I said there's so many Doctrine at least used to run off until you be preaching for 20 years trying to cover each Avenue that people are taking on a Doctrine and they'll fight with each other but that's pretty well like it was an organized religion we when Methodist we fight with the Baptist and the Baptists with the Pentecost trolls and this that and the other you know and didn't claim to believe the other one and there's always one was with the truth and the other one wasn't and I've even warned you of one thing and I believe it and I've said this for over 40 years I guess that one day I believe God will pour out an anointing upon this church that will change our bodies and take us home believe that I've always looked for that because that's what the prophet said all right but at the same time the rain falls from the Justin the unjust that's right so don't expect everybody to leave all their doctrinal thoughts and ideas when you begin to see the real rain falling on you because you know what the rain's going to be falling on them that's right yeah and they'll be saying I told you my Doctrine was right you know yeah I mean that's what they'll be saying so here's proof of it you know because I've always looked for that not a worldwide sweeping Revival right no no I don't I'm not looking for that that would be the two witnesses coming with the Jews but you know an anointing to strike the church but I believe that is the key to it I believe it's been striking the church for a long time it'll run around and said you know after the door this Gentile church is closed all anointed church then he's sitting gone for doing one year what theology is trying to do in 2000 now in quoting he said they said he's doing at night amen because he's always been doing it he's always been anointing the true church to bring her to the right place but as I said about it the scripture this morning you'd say well why would it need to be be herishes to prove us to see who we are right Amen to see if we'll stay with the word or we'll follow somebody's idea you know and uh what is it the guy that won't stand for something to fall for anything is that the way it goes I always missing that way quote it wrong but that's right you know sometimes I sometimes I get things right but you know just think on these things now and uh let's see I'm gonna hook something down there to cover but anyhow there's a Doctrine among the people of the message and it went overseas I ran into these things in different places and we had a personal experience with this Doctrine um you know where we went to church and everything and it was a doctrine that the basics of what it said and that's what I said now here's a whole lot of flames off this group leaves this part of it and this and it come out of the same situation of believing it but there was a brother that started back years ago there along in the uh late 60s and early 70s and some of you personally knew of these things that he said we don't have the Holy Ghost like they did in the book of Acts we don't have the new birth they believe basically this you know that you'd start here and when you reached the headstone of love that then you would have the new birth or and see even if you tried to talk to them about something and then they would say well you're turning the pyramid upside down things of that order and you know they've take quotes from run around them and try to base it on it and but yet not seeing that and I personally tried to talk with with the brothers that are about this Doctrine I said you're trying to preach adoption but you don't know how that's right well that offended them for me to tell them they didn't know how but I'm sorry I just don't have an education you forgive me I I just talk plain and plain language is easy to understand but it's easy to misunderstand you say well you're trying to tell them they didn't know nothing I wasn't doing that I was trying to tell them that they had a lot of things right but they just needed it lined up a little different because it wasn't coming out to fit the order like I said this morning of it if you say that the virtues the seven Thunder you know that part was the selling virtues will then if you start with faith is a virtue then you've got eight virtues so then you know it doesn't work out mathematically in things but I'm sure sorry for being that away O2 will remember the ones coming home this afternoon because that's where Joyce and and uh uh brother boy and Sister Janet are with the with the kids at the the Youth Camp bad brother guest donors and they're coming home today so you know remember that all right but they the doctrinal issue of the point was that you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like it was in the book of Acts and that went on for and has still going on and you know they're still facing the people around the country about the doctrine and that's what hurts me so hard and that's why that I've tried to help people because like when we went to the Philippines and I ran into people to hurt it you know they told me I said when these doctrines came we didn't have anything to to be able to kind of you know counteract the doctrine We Believe brother Brown was a prophet we believed you know and we were just getting that that's all the books they had was just a few books and and they couldn't argue doctrines with these people right but thank God now that they have the the way to you know through the prophet's message and to be able to to do that you know and help but still you're limited to how much has been preached to you amen and how much understanding you can have that's right that's right you know I mean you could say well I've read the message well that's wonderful but has God put it together by somebody that can you know bring it to a place to give you a better understanding you know and that way all right but we're trying to get into that but see they the man actually was teaching me I talked with him and he said he said well you just don't have the Holy Ghost like like it is in the Bible and uh I said well you know I'm I'm sorry I said I'm not trying to prove to you and I'm not today I'm not trying to prove to you whether I'm born again or not that's that's beside the point is for the try to prove a point like that but I said brother what I'm trying to show you is that brother Branham said that he met people that if they had the bad tearsome of the Holy Ghost just like the book of Acts 50 years before he ever came on the scene you know and the those people you know you've heard me refer to it that that people will say those things like that and they look at it like them and I've had the brother to personally sit as close to brother colleague to point his finger at me and say if you got the baptism in the Holy Ghost stand up and show me well I'm glad that God never told me to ever stand up because if he'd ever said stand up I stood up right I mean that's just honest and I finally just had to leave because it got to that point but before I left I had a long talk with a brother and I showed him that brother Branham said people had the baptism when the Holy Ghost yeah all right but that didn't change him right at the point it was discussing it with me he pulled away but then he went right on because now their point was that nobody has perfect love and they you know that nobody has perfect love and if you have to have perfect love remember when around went beyond the curtain of time he said nothing can go here except that would have perfect love and he said you know the brother he said well nobody's got perfect love and I remember two things and I pulled out the books and read them to him and one of them was that brother Branham saw that lady behind the curtain of time that was 90 years old that was converted in his ministry you remember that one he said she's 90 years old when she got converted and I said she was there yep if you remember growing around said it actually his first girlfriend was beyond the curtain of time right well see the point was that they could argue if you just said well what do you mean that was people brought around the city who see their point was we don't know when they're getting there we don't know where they come from but I I I had a decent memory then and and I just discussed it with the brother but the point I want you to get is brought around said the baptism of the Holy Ghost today by the new birth that you have by justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is the same New Birth that came on today of Pentecost amen that's right now one scripture would tie it all together enough for me because I've always tried to tell you that even in the days of Martin Luther that the just shall live by faith was the baptism my Holy Ghost for that day amen right and we just got through that amen sanctification under Wesley was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth of that age giving them eternal life putting him in the body of Christ all right now the new birth then would be the the the the the baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you that would be the same holy ghost that fell under their Pentecost or you would have a different Holy Ghost now I know each age it was degreed out however how you would make the statement that the Holy Ghost was kind of you know put under the justification blood around and said now that's was great and they had it for there but said when you come to the Pentecostal he said it was the fullness of the baptism amen all right and then that see then you would you would say well now why would these people want to believe it that way well they were they were looking at adoption and trying to explain it but not knowing how to explain it amen because in the adoptional series and then the greater things of of going on in the message we know that we are being born again amen wonderful we're being born again but you must have your first bases upon whether or not you are born again and you know and brother Brown statue of perfect man says you're born again in faith all right then you're growing in Grace and knowledge and see then that was all I was trying to do was show that run around and that's all I'm going to do this afternoon is to try to read some things that brother Branham said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is here just like it was under that Pentecost amen all right all right now I admit and I admitted it to them on some of the occasions of talking with them that they had a point of what they were saying but not all together and you remember I told you we were out in Colorado and I was talking with two brothers and we were deer hunting together and and we were discussing this point where brother Brown said people had the Holy Ghost 50 years for him and they both said they couldn't believe that I mean both of them did now that's their words that's right they said they they couldn't believe it and I said well let me explain something to you I said there's a difference on the death Pentecost see and that's helped me to understand on the death Pentecost you had 120 in the upper room that had been tutored by the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and the Holy Ghost fell on them see then it put them right here right brotherly kindness and holy spirit now the love was The Headstone that we covered this morning that hadn't come yet right he couldn't manifest himself in that he could only manifest himself in the pyramid as as the new birth and the point of coming up and the disciples had these virtues all right but I said the 120 see if they were at that place they had been tutored for three and a half years when Holy Ghost fell it felt a word they had the the Jesus in the The Gospel that they took the word and held it let's see they cherished it but like I've always explained to you or tried to the Bible said that Jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection all right now not this count before right just take the Bible is it safe you've seen of over 500 brethren you know I have to re-range all right the worst the other 390 right why didn't they make it to the upper room right because they've not been tutored in the word right amen they just weren't allowed to see the Lord Jesus but they were not tutored in the word so they didn't make it to Pentecost right right so that's one group of people under their Pentecost where the baptism of the Holy Ghost That Could Quicken the word that they heard that's right but then the 3000 outside it only heard one sermon sermon Peter preached a sermon three thousand people were saved right filled with the Holy Ghost right there that day and it was a day of Pentecost all right so that brought around is exactly right amen the 3 000 had to baptism of the Holy Ghost on the death Pentecost right if anybody has received the new birth in faith the Born Again experience that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost Justified just exactly like Pentecost right that's not the growth development up through the year coming out to these other things right no that takes the tutoring the training as we were talking about this morning that even brother Branham when he was born again where was he born again faith but God could lead him to the deeper depths of the word because he was the prophet a man can't teach you only what he is let's let me give him the scripture uh the husband must be first partaker of the fruit couldn't preach about the Statue of a perfect man until right can you achieved that Amen in his life all right I could preach about your seals until God revealed him died amen how much honest it's been big I tried to everybody's attracted him but then when he revealed it to me then 82 and 83 then I haven't preached it I preached it for Words some things on it but I haven't went back over each seal individually because I didn't feel that too never have feel that dude I believe it stands Amen to this day I preached on Daniel 70 weeks in 1974. and I haven't chosen I have spoke on it in times like 2005 I think I was covering it but never like I did back there because I didn't feel like it was needed all right but get know what I'm saying on the death Pentecost you've got two different groups of people one group of people that had been tutored and the depth of the word that they had and the Holy Ghost falling to Quicken that word because that's what the scripture said you bring you remembers whatsoever I'm saying right so he quickened to them what they had planted in their field or their their being you know and that gave them a deeper depth of the word of God and God chose those people right for the basics of the writing of the New Testament you only have a couple in there like Timothy or one of them but those were trained under Paul right to bring you know the message and that's what Peter was doing as we were reading this morning a second Peter added your faith virtue and all this temporary Faith Peter was teaching those people how to come door that had the new birth right how to come to where he was in the new world Amen and that's what brother Reynold was doing right he was trying to tell those Pentecostals see that had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he didn't deny that they had it okay sir you see all that this didn't have it and I see you're going wrong that's right you're going wrong and just say people don't have it that's right then you'll start saying the lutherans don't have it and the methodists don't have it and the Baptists don't have it maybe that's what people is doing they they've made those into doctrines that it turned out to where it wouldn't be correct right but anybody that's born again has the New Birth the new birth is put you into the body of Christ are you going to leave Luther and Wesley him out of it we have went through the years of the teaching that even in the children of Israel with their Journey going into the Promised Land you remember they were two and a half tribes that went over and fought out with the children of Israel through Canaan right but they came back and took their inheritance on this side of Jordan we'll study your Bible with her in the Old Testament we'll see that two and a half tribes which Lutheran the West Limbs and the people through there and you're you're uh people coming along into the pilgrim Holiness and different things you know right and coming in there that didn't walk on with the word they went into the land showing that they had it right but they came back and took their inheritance right right all right that's that's all the way through your Bible all right that's right now well see that's why I believe that the new birth is the new birth it's the birth of the word of whatever age you see it all right man and I was telling Aaron I told my wife and brother and sister Tatum one time that this brother was going to read a certain way out of the church age book the only time I ever missed services but you know I guess in my life just about it I have a great big old Ryerson that was really boil a couple they're really killing me and uh I told myself I'm not going this morning but I said the brother's going to read that now the church age book and you remember running around them in the church yet booked talking about the Lutheran age and he said it's the on full Field age that's what he calls it he called wet Luther's age the unfulfilled I said here's the way he's going to read he's going to read to try to prove his point that Luther didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's going to read that to say that it was an unfilled age and that's what he done exactly believe in the sister corrected him he said I was all the same thing he said his unfulfilled age unfilled age they didn't have the Holy Ghost back there well I I can't go that way I'm just sorry I wish I could in some respects because I like to be liked and friendly but I still got to make my stand amen that's right to be what I am all right and I believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that ever born again believer got it just like the book of Acts amen because you would tear up Acts 2. yeah right you would have to rewrite the Bible because according to the Bible it says the promise is what unto you and your children and them that are far off and it means our Lord shall call amen is the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you'd have to write that that's right that the Holy Ghost is to the disciples only and then in the end time so and so is going to tell you when he gets it yeah because that what's their point the brothers I said about the thunder message he said I'll tell you when this and the brother about the the point of saying no Holy Ghost Doctrine he was plainly saying I'll tell you when you got it well um I like to be nice but you know I just don't believe it though all right man I'm sorry I believe that everybody has an opportunity to receive the new birth right amen amen I believe the new birth and I've taught you over and over in the days of Luther was the New Birth that was the just you'll live by faith amen that's right and if you and I are not anchored on that or what Luther called it the truth not what he thought of the wrong thing right but what he thought of the truth we're anchored on that or we don't have no anchor right amen see you're cutting your own legs out and under you you don't have nowhere to stand in the gospel and you're leaving yourself out of the message but it's because of people I told you that I talked to a man down at the schoolhouse we're having a supper and I told him these things and he said no Lutheran Wesley said they didn't have the Holy Ghost and said brother random said Zeus or Street was false I said right I didn't say that you know they come right here and he said told the same thing did Lutheran Wesley didn't have the Holy Ghost since then he calls for false because he wouldn't take correction right right and already told him down there that he was wrong of course you know that didn't make no difference no no and these Fellers you know they've got their own ideas that's their business the truth is what I'm like I'm asking you a simple point do you believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're here today for you amen if you want to receive it and attack baptism of the Holy Ghost is exactly like the day of Pentecost yeah because if you don't believe that what do you got to stand up that's right right yep what what would be your hopes what would be your your doing you know of anything I mean how much base mine up on the word amen right and I'm not trying to convince you whether or not I have the Holy Spirit right I'm not trying to convince no one of that never happens I'm trying to get you to see it's for you right but if you don't believe it's fire you see you'll never seek it that's right I've always tried to encourage you I had rather seek God all my life and find out I've got something yes that do not seek Him and come to the end to find out I don't have it all right well I seek God every day brother Dale yes I pray every day God feel this whole being fill me with the holy spirit amen amen there's one brother Brown parade sometimes hard to pray I'm gonna run prayed one day he said Lord said you short me in other words you you cut him off he Surety you're right pronounce that word he said you took my wife and daughter he said do it again Lord do it again you think he was meaning take away my my boy and my second wife and whatever you know no he was asking God to bring him down we're listening to a tape last night uh what is the Holy Ghost in 59 and brought around him on there was saying the Lord you know bring him into that place do whatever you got to do to bring me to the place that I can get rid of William Branham and let me stand on God's word no matter what you have to do Lord well that's where I want to be don't you isn't that the thing that we're here for that's right just to hear the truth but it says the truth she'll Set You Free Part truth won't set us free right part truth will bind us to a doctrine of some issue amen well after a day you don't know them brothers was trying to know when I cried all right I'm just telling you what I know I'm telling you what I personally experienced those people sitting in the building here right now that experience those things too about this about the Holy Ghost and whether it is all I'm trying to do is get you to see the road around the city for you now the New Birth when you first received the new birth no you don't receive the new birth up here that's what everybody wants they want a quick fix yeah grab it all at one time let's get out of here yeah no never born again believer he's going to get a faith that's right the disciples were the only 120. that's not a Church of Christ Doctrine it's only the 12 had it either now that's the truth of the Gospel right yeah that's what they teach you they say well I'm in the 12-handed that's where brother run said well what about Paul he said what about worried or die and it's in the church all the way down through then they couldn't argue would you say that's why brother random would say I met people that had the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost he said well did they grab everything he said no because it wouldn't today right it wasn't the time they had no background that's it amen people don't even understand the zoosa street go read a little bit Azusa Street 1906 was trinitarian people the Oneness Doctrine never started until about 19 and 12. right see then they went on and the cabbage down wrote around and said on that go read run around and say something go read it see what said well you didn't know you got time to listen to all kind of false Doctrine that's right and garbage cans yep I'm sorry that's plenty at least what I want to do and what I'm trying to do in my life is put mine into the message and I listen to people to hear what they're saying everything just because this man here went against me about this Doctrine I've never had it never had no issue with him the man where I left the church from that's preached twice in this church since I've been the pasture but he won't let me go to his church and preach but he preached two times right here and I'm happy I thank the world right amen if I needed anything in the world the man would do anything I can believe in the world to help me that's right his wonderful brother but I just can't agree with him but I've been honest with him to tally yeah we were done Colorado and he kept telling his brother every time something would come up he says that's why I left my church that was nice listen blueberry broad salvation that's why he left my church and I bit my tongue the second time I tried to do it third time he said listen he done told you three times I left his church I said I'm gonna tell you why that I left yesterday yeah I said because he's been brought it up three times I tried to be nice but I'm just on this I'm just trying to be myself and I still love people right amen now that preacher to preached here it is on you didn't believe exactly the way we believe but I only had one man that's ever come here that I trusted to the pope he had to come here and try to preach something that wouldn't write and you know I still love the brother I just didn't know what he said and I came and straightened it out all right that's just all the problem but now listen right around him I've given you these before so you can pull these up and let a slice read to get down just a few things on what we're talking about page 143 of the church age book The Samaritan Church age the church age book all right and we've read these many times before but you ought to be able to see what I'm talking about in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost or the True Believer now that's as blunt as can anybody can be right I say in every age the evidence was the same come on those who had the spirit the teacher heard to work and that spirit in them took the word and called it revealed it to them and they were the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it again amen that's Luther Wesley Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian all of those people had truths at the time right have you ever noticed one thing how about you explaining some things to me brother random in about 19 and 16. I'm pretty sure it's 62 but I'll find it for you maybe 60. but I'm pretty sure it's 1962. brother said made a statement that was astounding to me he said the Baptist has just become a denomination you see I knew where we came from and how long we how far we was behind a hundred years before then right the Badness was a denomination what's he saying you know that really those people never become Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran uh anything you want to bring out you know that when brother Brown stood there with the word that's when they showed their code right right when he brought the word that's when they showed their code all right amen you take that and think about it see then you can see the Baptist become a denomination after they wouldn't accept what brought around had to say so did all denominations denominate and die right because they wouldn't accept the truth of the hour it was offered unto him he came through the Baptist Church and then went on through trying to preach to the other churches and and going out to him but never denying what he believed is a Baptist he said we beat him in the back they come through with something no no that's it he never argued with anybody about what they believed right he just said I just didn't see that he said now you asked me and I just tell you I can't see it like that right well that was a wonderful brother but he still called them brothers right right he said one day to Billy Graham would see the truth you want that quote I don't know he said Owen Roberts had the bad kids you said well chapter no anyone now you go I heard you were brother random I don't know what he meant right you don't either amen that's right you're just trying to justify something but you see those brothers that walked away from him the demonstrikarian all of those people that walked away from blood around them Oxford and all he never said they didn't have it that's right you showed me what you see you'll say when I know them people ain't got it what all right just remember there was a time you called you believed you had the baptism in the Holy Ghost and you were sitting listening to error being talked to it right and hollering amen and don't even do it today here right is that running up amen right it won't even amen it now but you amen didn't shout and run all over the place you know why it's because it was lack of understanding right that's right let's let God be the judge of what things are Amen Let Him decide who's what and you and I just go ahead and be Brothers and Sisters in Christ we run around and said what no let's go to number two every age with the age of the baptism when the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost given for the prophet said same Holy Spirit to save the lutherans the Sanctified the methodists that baptized the Pentecostal is now set in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for right who led Luther to the Joshua live by faith that's right if it was not an inward experience of his own work you know God's work for him come on but now we're going to read quite a few to where you say well brother Dale you just hollering about something and saying something but let's just read and see what brought around had to say go ahead to number three do you have the new birth do you have the baptism when the Holy Ghost it's the same holy ghost that came on to be a Pentecost which you have all right let's see what the prophet that you said you've heard of Dr Reed had listened to brother Brown 1953. 11 29 the evening service a message called testimony and I said it is Dr Reed head because he had come to him to talk her brother Ronald had went to him he had contacted him and if you remember I believe this is the one that made some remarks about brother Brown and wrote around was so nice when he invited he came to it you know he apologized to him about it that may be wrong about that part but just read above it you'll get it he said I said it is Dr Reed head God is my judge the same holy ghost that fell on Pentecost it's the same Lord Jesus today in the full thing kind of power all right he said can I receive it I said yes sir should win a lot of people say well you can't get it right the doctrine if you say you don't believe us here then you would say it's not here so you'd have to tell Dr Reid head no you can't get it because it ain't here but that wasn't what he had to say no he said when I said I said right now I said how did I get it I said by laying on the hands pray for him laid hands on him God gave him the baptism of the Holy Ghost 1953. all right look at the next one the resurrection e94. I believe he's the same God that was back there the same holy ghost that fell on the dead of Pentecost is the same holy ghost that we feel right here now believe us now this I believe the same power that preached the gospel all night by Paul when a man fell and killed himself Paul is laid his body over his body and he received life again I believe that same holy ghost power is right here he is right here to Fascinate a bunch of people that will make them sit hours after hours in an old hot building to listen to The Glorious gospel of Christ believe it's not this sound like he's talking about the same Holy Ghost Paul man yeah lick the next one 1954 12 19 even acts of the Holy Ghost he's the same yesterday today and forever the same holy ghost that fell into their Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost as today what I'll admit it's been trapped on made fun of misinterpreted misrepresented and everything else like that that's only the devil counterfeiting but there is a real genuine baptism of the holy spirit that brings the same results that they had on the date of Pentecost that's right all right click the next one 1955 6-12 now watch in a minute we're going to drop over because I just asked you to go home and just run into your computer and run in the same Holy Ghost as Pentecost let's run again there's a lot more that I didn't bring because you'll see that I'll drop from the 50s and we'll drop 64.65. the show that's before and after the seals and everything else all right so what's what he says on the message presence of the Lord 55 6 12. I believe he said if you abide in me and my words and you ask what you will and it'll be given to you believe us all this amen I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever he's Everlasting peace the same holy ghost that fell into their Pentecost it's here tonight believe us now this now the doctrine was that brother Branham had that Holy Spirit but nobody else didn't have it well now he said Dr Reed had received it right and he said it was here first so if it was for one man Dr reedhead that solves the problem issues over with you have no argument right right no don't try to quote all of the quote you have no argument if there's anyone because we're gonna get to one in a minute how many of you will shout glory to Hallelujah that brother Brown was at a meeting one day when the Holy Spirit came in and swept across the building and even his coat was just moving you've heard the story he said that's the same holy ghost that fell on the dead pentagon we'll get to that in a minute okay go ahead to the next one 1956 1006 a wedding supper and now on the western people that's who we are now in this Western Hemisphere here it's poured out the baptism of the Holy Ghost the son has come out to shine again on the at the setting just as it did at the rising and the same holy ghost that fell on the Eastern people 2000 years ago has been Shattered by Creeds and denominations coming across this day of dark day of dark nor light but in the evening time while she's setting the baptism when the Holy Ghost was poured out on the western people with the same portion the same signs and the same Wonders that they did on the Eastern people just exactly amen looks like he's building pretty good case don't it go ahead to the next one 1959 812 Discerning the body of the Lord that's how we discern to see if our discernment is right if the Bible said Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever believe it it's the Bible if Jesus said the things that I do shall you do I believe it and if the Bible said that the Holy Ghost is forever generation as many as the Lord Our God shall call I don't believe a handshake takes its place I believe the same holy ghost that fell then shows the same signs the same wonders and for every generation right okay for that big Bible right do you and your children and then we're the far off the minister Lord Our God shall call right that was the promise look at the next one 1965-15 eating and service adoption which they put them down part one part two part three for this new message system to use it all right not just sunk not just some to the apostles and some to this but he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings the same holy ghost that fell into their Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost that made Mary shout and speak with tongues and have a wonderful time and rejoice in the things that she did is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost that led Paul on that Old Ship where it looked like it was waterlogged and was gone 14 days and nights no moon or Stars he looked out there in every way you had a devil on it glancing and gleaming his teeth and said I'll sing the old boy same Holy Ghost okay next 1962 see we're just getting lower and closer and closer because I swear children all right 62 122 confirmation of the commission but remember it was promised that all clouds would clear away in the evening time it's evening time now and when the clouds are all clear away that same Sun s-o-n that shined his power through the Holy Ghost upon the Eastern people has in the last 50 years broke back the clouds of denominations and everything and poured down the Holy Ghost upon the Western people that the same Sun same Holy Ghost same sign same lights same power same evidence and everything that it was and the gospel had been preached with power and demonstration anywhere in the countries that's right that's right all over the world signed and wonders that are Fallen to Believers next 1964. now you see where we're at after the seals in case some of the people out there there's a doctor among the people that brother Brown was right after the seals broke but he was all messed up before it was broke he said he thought taught three processes from birth that's 1964. future home and he always taught it that away go read as you said 1964 416 when the rides were open they knew him he's talking about still this is the dead and the you know raising the dead and appeared in the last days when they said years ago when the Pentecostal group first started now watch what he's saying there was no such a thing as that when they first started it's the fastest growing Church in the world the Pentecost it's the message they they've had now for 50 years they said it couldn't be done but it was done anyhow they said there was no such thing as the Holy Ghost the people went on and received it just the same God promised he would pour out his Spirit how are you going to stop it when he promised he he would do it they said nobody will believe it but they did believe it and that's all that I'm trying to say to you and I if if that devil can put any doubt in your mind that the Holy Ghost is for you you'll keep you from receiving it all right amen amen that's right but if you can take the word and say the prophet said it nothing else right the prophet had to say look at what is this one drop back 1950 look at this one 115 believe it's all this on the death Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell down from heaven our Mana after we've come through the blood and have been saved been cleansed from our sins and the Holy Ghost fell brother Peter said on the death Pentecost is for you and your children and for them to so far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call and every person that enters into the baptism of the Holy Spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the death Pentecost Hallelujah I believe it's God's truth not something that looked like it but the real thing same kind of holy ghost that fell back to our Falls now the same kind of whole the real Holy Ghost brings forth the same kind of an Evidence and proves that they had backgone comes with the same Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and how good you say I like this oh I feel it right now that's right it's real Justice Just as real as it ever was to me that's right just the same holy spirit that fell back there on the day of Pentecost all right go to the next one 54 8 11 shorts the father I think when you see a power of God switch through a meeting it means this that Jesus Christ is living somewhere hallelujah it's the same holy ghost power that raised him up on the day of Pentecost and give them the blessing of God that power is still in existence somewhere come on now when you can see a church that's together with God what a marvelous thing God in this universe to a shall learn go to the next one the interview 56 121 Peter settled to death Pentecost Acts 2 he said for the promises unto you and to your children to them that far off and even as men as the Lord Our God shall call the same holy spirit that failed was forever generation even to the Gentiles those that were always considered far off even as men as the Lord and our God shall call Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of sins and you shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children into the Gentiles that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and as long as God's still calling God's still given the Holy Spirit they kept almonds full of that and they talked about back in the Old Testament when they kept always full of that of that of it that every man entered into the holy place you know the new high priest would even come in the new high priest was allowed to take a a piece of bread from the original right you kept almonds of that every man aired into the Holy Spirit every priest could taste a mouthful of the original amount that fell in the beginning and so is it today the middle wall of petition is taken down and every man that's called can come in and have a heart full of the same holy ghost that fell on the death Pentecost it'll be to the end of the world now listen this one and people want to quote I've had people to tell me about this quote that said the Holy Ghost wasn't here the same one that told me the Holy Ghost wasn't here like it was in the book of Acts quoted this to me come on 258 128 the Oneness of unity what was that get that tape listen to it just like the Holy Spirit Come On To Death in the call come right down the wind just swept over here him and he's a witness of it raise your hand everyone honest from your heart there it is it's went right through the building just then it's the same Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost comes by the same word blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen it's the same Holy Ghost the same one that justified the Lutheran Sanctified the message baptized the Pentecost now sit in order to come into the Lord go to the next one I think we got about two more or three more all right we're back at 63 now 7 31 after the opening of the seals there is only one way provided by God for anything reached in 1963-731. them days has passed yeah that's what people you know watch people tell you that yeah you think that stopped that hunger-hearted people they took a hold on this word and know that the Bible said the promises unto you and to your children to them that's far off in his men as the Lord Our God shall call they stay there on their faces and cried and begged and kicked up their heels and screamed until God poured out the same Holy Ghost upon them that he did at the beginning amen what is it it's God's provided way that's right they believed it and God provided the way for them Peter gave them the provided way on the day of Pentecost check and see if he's not talking about Azusa Street go to that message write it down check it see if anything what he's talking about see a juicers treat people like dirt prayed until God sent them to baptism of the holy God right all right look tonight 1963 801 a paradox for me to live is Christ have it you know I believe that that same God that's on to their Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divide into himself with glowing tongues among his people he's here tonight it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost I know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotion screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever go ahead to the next 1963-1216 we have senior starting in the East and have come to worship Him or he's the same yesterday today and forever for the promises and Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent over one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission to sin and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call as many as ever called the same Holy Ghost tonight is just the same it was then to the honest heart look what he said to the honest heart if it doesn't it is too unusual for you to believe God is it too unusual for you to believe God okay look at the mice and I think Mercy two more all right influence should break 64. look look up here see here in the way God has got a way to prepare how did he do it on the day of Pentecost Peter told them what to do he wrote a prescription for them and it's always remained the sign prescription every age has been the same right don't tamper with it you'll kill your patient that's what most of the people have done spiritually has killed the people of this message by their Doctrine I'm sorry they said what can we do to be saved he said repent I want to be baptized out of the name of Jesus Christ remission sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to them that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call I'm going to read face because they've done right that's right here that's right here tonight if God is still calling that's the prescription you can still receive the same holy ghost that they received there just you can receive the same thing tonight just follow through that's all you do yes then you can say all right look at that I think it's the last one maybe she called first 1965 919 we got a living God not one that died 1900 years ago and stayed in the grave but one that raised again Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever the same holy ghost that fell on the death Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's here now he is the satisfying portion because he is the word that's right the Holy Ghost wrote the word he interprets the word the Bible said in second Peter that the Holy Spirit wrote the word man of old move by the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible now you can't do it you can't satisfy that Holy Spirit with nothing less than God himself living in you and the person of the Holy Ghost if that's not enough quotes and things to be able to to say well at least the prophet says is here like I said the doctrine was that nobody had perfect love brother random said you've got to have perfect love to go beyond the curtain of time but everybody that has the New Birth has perfect love really our love is not perfected right I agree with you there I agree that we need but the new birth is perfect love right amen the new birth is the Life of Christ amen see we start with a foundation then we can grow that's right for 40 years we've been preaching this and trying to grow yeah when others it went to everything in the book to solve their thirst you know and well that was a lot of doctrines and all kind of issues that's all right that's their business ain't gonna do with them you got to do who don't try my best to Pastor all right man anybody else wants to listen that's fine you say but yet you just don't understand well you show me what the prophet said contrary to what I said amen I showed it and divided it when you receive the new birth as a babe in Christ you were born again at Faith you're not born again at the headstone you're born again at Faith and you grow in Grace and knowledge up the statue of a perfect man through what is the prophet teaching adoption to where the son becomes with the nature of the father and then the father can say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him right I believe that's what happened with brother random in 1963 when the seals broke to him it brought his message that he's supposed to bring that was his adoption you can argue that point all you want to you told you bring to me and showed me where he was adopted today I know something great did happen I know it did sure and she's like these River Jordan people arguing that he didn't become God until the River Jordan run around and said there was no greater experience in the word of God than the River Jordan he said other than of this age we're living in see they'll quote you part of it it won't go at all right other than what's happening right now right right somebody has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost somebody longing after God all right come on seeking after him and praying to climb up the pyramid sure it may be slow cause it's like 40 years to get us ready right now I'm gonna I'm gonna read my last notes but I'm gonna say brother Gary wake up punching there because he asked me this question I answered this question to Brother Gary years ago he said brother Dale do you think we have the new birth like the day of Pentecost you know the Holy Ghost he asked me that question years ago I told him yes because I believe ever born again believer this got the new birth he's got the same New Birth that came on the day of Pentecost but it was a three thousand outside right right do you say does everybody have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the 120 in the upper room and I have to say no don't think so you know and I'm not worried about it I've only got one thing to say what it's preached and believed is more evidence than anything you could see are here that's right amen my sister street that would start out as Pentecostals could you say to them that we have the Holy Ghost the same as the dead being called they could probably said I don't think so and you know they were trinitarians so they would have had problems with believing that God is real all right you and I have no excuse me 40 years since the death of the Prophet over that 40-something man you see going off the scene to get into this message and get prepared and I believe somewhere around the world that same Ministry of Jesus Christ that brought around them had is in the bride not in one individual not in brother Dale or I'm starting to say the other one because I always try to rhyme in two together but it never will be in one individual again it's in the body of Christ amen the same Ministry the prophet speaking of in the body of Jesus Christ around the world is the same Ministry Jesus Christ had right don't see it don't say this and I'm sorry what you see or don't see I'm sorry if you're basing up on then I wonder what your Holy Ghost is that's right because the holy ghost in my heart is always from the time that Doctrine struck Us in 1968 the holy ghost in my heart told me that wasn't right my case Holy Ghost tell you what the truth is somebody I just don't see it what are we supposed to see where has it ever been you're supposed to see it you're supposed to believe it I just don't see nobody if I've had people tell me that I just don't see nobody with the signs and all as it was in the book of Acts along with dish and I know you don't like it but you bring the book of Acts people right here today and let them live under this lady you'll see them position and let's see what they'll do that's right yeah it was old Paul said Paul was hearing me driving a Cadillac other brother got up said Paul was here he'd be in jail for night time I like that one would you bring Paul up here beat all them time and all everything and you let him Face Lady of Sia that's right and you ain't gonna like these other statements you see Paul would stand right here and he'd say what's wrong with you brother so and so why are you not sister so and so why are you not agreeing with the holy spirit amen he wouldn't play no games I stand here and see frowns and all kind of things the head shaking like well I don't agree with you I have to keep on preaching because you see the Lord hadn't told me to call it out he never does I'll call it whether I'll be Pastor the next day or what goes on I know I'm undoing that's right so I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost is here like both experiences of the day of Pentecost I believe the new birth is proven that that's right they cheer that away all right amen now you having the new birth proves that you got it like it was on the 3000s and I believe drunk people have been tutored and trained until they're standing where the apostles were standing right you say yeah but why aren't there more signs and wonders if you answer me one question why did Jesus have to take people outside of the city we're outside the house to pray for him you want to say in the Bible let's talk in the Bible he had to take them outside right why because he said the unbelief that was there right yes I got a nephew that's still living today he's what 40 years old yeah at least 40. he had sister's fibrosis as a baby I was at the hospital they told him to take him home Nicholson I think it was in Atlanta one of those real he said take him home my brother he said should I get this machine and get this the doctor said no don't spend your money did he be back here it was too far they brought your little boy home I went over to see him and I prayed and I prayed I knew they would believe me if I tried to talk to him it'd take too long to explain it so I picked a little boy up little baby just I don't know a few weeks maybe a month or two old I forgot how old he was he was on up he lived a little while you know and you know what sister fibrosia does it lungs your lungs fill up right and you can't live back then it would only lived about 20 21 years old with the most everybody anybody ever lived I pretty much that I said Lord forgive all of the unbelief you just touch this little boy sure a couple of years ago he had a double lung transplant because his lungs were filled up but he's still alive amen he'll tell you when I come and pray for him he'll tell you when I went to the hospital to lay my hand up under there I said God you spared his life he was up to me and I forgot how old is he spared his life and I swear it again he lived to be 40 years old before he had a double lung transplant you think I wasn't happy when they done the lung crackling I prayed for make sure it didn't fail do we have any Witnesses do we need to know that God is Among Us what do we need brother Gary's a witness back there and he's laid up in the hospital with his heart out of rhythm and we prayed for him well it's out now what's that got to do with it that's right waiting on your faith come on waiting on you to wake up God done his part when he walked in says you're getting out of here how many of you've been told by these lips this is what will happen how many of you stood right here and heard me say it won't rain till I call for it and he didn't so I come in here and said you better bro up your windows it's going to rain tonight and it rained amen amen so you want to talk to me about it don't talk to me about it there ain't no God I'm sorry Wade and I you've heard us tell about it standing with a man down in the woods didn't have no cell phone connection to call the doctors or anything the man died his eyes rolled back I'll hold him out of the woods Christ he'll tell you about it you know his name Randall Henderson I'll give you his telephone number he'll tell you what happened but his eyes roll back the way he looked at me he said he's called something out I don't know what it was something said random and it was that loud yeah why we've seen the debt raised we've seen that sick heels and then you tell me there is not nothing here like it was on the day of Pentecost right I'm gonna go ahead with it thunder I believe the Acts of the Apostles is here with us I believe the headstones here for you to receive it if you'll receive it I believe it's been proven among us to manifest itself Among Us that's right amen and yet people will say we don't have the Holy Ghost today like it was in the book of Acts you want to stay here all evening and talk about the healings and the Wonders everything you want me to talk about how many times can you hear me tell about that my wife had the blood condition we were supposed to have but one child period She had an Rh factor in her blood and that was before they had these shots and things that could be done you know they can take care of it now and we we've had one child we're supposed to had any more weight and tariffs both had the yellow effect in their eyes and their body showing that the blood was there her she had an Rh factor her blood was negative my blood was positive I gave gallons of pins General Motors we love to get off the line you know get cookies and restaurants we get blood every six weeks or every how many weeks it come up and I had gallon pins with a positive she wound up being pregnant with Anna I come here and told a dream before then that I saw a little girl about six or seven years old with a long black hair somewhere in there and I said I saw a little boy that belonged to brother moat and there's forest and Anna here the same age basically and I saw him in a dream and come here and told about it of course people laughed because that was 70 and it was born 73. and they said you're going to miss a rat shirt because the Rapture is coming in 73. I said I don't care what you're saying I'm just telling the dream that was what has told me tell me you're gonna miss it well you know the story went to the doctor they wanted to check exactly the blood compared to her blood went in and had a new doctor and they run blood tests at the hospital naturally the nurse she's done it all the time because I they have a hard time getting my blood out I want to keep it they they dig in there and try to find it I should get it out of my ear you can get all you want to yeah and my arm will get this black where they try to find the blood flap that's what they've done that day when I went to the doctor and the doctor told me well I said well new doctor you know he said well how wonderful she said one he said well you're you're a negative with the RH but your husband is a negative she said you better check your record my husband's a positive he said according these records at the hospital we say negative I remember what we went for the doing so we went I told her I said go back and have it run again and I throw that lady next time I said make sure you get it in the right vial this time because I was still doubting I guess and it wound up my blood now is a negative medically impossible for your blood there's two one nurse sitting right back here it ain't no way that your blood can change that way you got movements in it you know that can be done but never to change from positive to negative or negative to positive and you know what we got the little girl back there you know kind of growed up now you know Forest is up in Tennessee and you tell me there's no God I walked into doctor's office one day crippled up in my knees and he said I'll take your kneecap off and I just looked at him and laughed so you'll have to take my kneecap off you sit in my house I said go ahead I'll take it all be sure big trades if we're out I spent over 30 years ago I still got my knees you know what the other day went and had a shot put in there before we went to Alabama hunting because when he got bothered me no devil they said see there I said yeah 30 years later you know what you think I'm gonna wear out Satan you know I'm just laughing at it yeah thank you told a doctor I said Do you believe God heal me from blood pressure and he said no I stole my wife as you get me another doctor ain't going back to an unbeliever I went eight years without taking when eight years without glasses I got where I couldn't even read looking out there and it just wave up and down I had to start shooting scope on a gun because I couldn't see the orange I can shoot and you see me a lot of times I stand and read Bible print right here the spirit of God hath made me in the breath of almighty God had given me life 71 be 72 pretty quick I'm too much of a living witness all right of God's healing but for me to doubt that he's here as he was in the book of the hacks he said but I'd like to see it you've got it to open your eyes before you can see that's right you are bound by Creeds of man and Doctrine like I'm saying if you don't believe the Holy Ghost as far you you will never seek that Holy Ghost but if you at least believe it's far you let me at least declare it for you all right amen whether I've got it or not as far as you that's right the same one bit Paul used the same one Peter and all of them how many gods did Paul and Peter and him have right right that's right amen amen how many gods do we preach right I mean it's been about 40 years most of you heard the teaching of the godhead for about 40 years amen amen well we ought to be somewhere pretty close you know but you see I'm not convinced him trying to convince you who I am I'm trying to convince you God is real amen he's for you it won't save you to see him in me it won't save you to see him in brother Brown he won't save you to see him in the Lord Jesus it'll only be when you see him in your own life right and receive him as a personal savior to you all right amen and then the Bible will be right and no man can call Jesus the Christ accepting me by a personal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right that was a promise amen come on brother I hope you understand what I'm saying yes I believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is here yes amen amen let me quote my wife because this is a point she made years ago it was the word that was eat down in the church ages you agree all right the words eat night amen wouldn't the Holy Spirit each day right you show me where it was I challenge you on the basis of the Bible and brother Ron's message you come and show me where the Holy Ghost was in today no the word was these things that's right and the Holy Ghost can only work according to the amount of words you have that's right amen so when Luther came out that's all the Holy Ghost could work with was that just shall live by faith amen but now we stand in an hour when all the things the sealed's broke the prophet's message is brought them to us all right and the Holy Ghost is here let me quote brother Brown go see that went with another Doctrine and we'll get back to see the other Doctrine was when they come in the message I'll get to this one but you couldn't be saved after 63 because Redemption was over how many of you heard that one couldn't be saved after 63 because Redemption was over you know what I told him then I said well according to my Bible the prophet I believe Redemption was over for the foundation of the world I'm so sorry I just can't believe you and I said maybe the reason is I don't have it and see for two years I saw God for the baptism but then the day I received it I said now come tell me there ain't no one Holy Ghost now tell me you think we say you got your 63. that's right that's right until you go jump in the dry lake that's right because I'm a personal witness that's right I'm a witness of these things I stood right here not bragging on myself but telling you the witness of the Holy Ghost About Eyes Open about I mean about well now we're praying for sister her eyes to come and they're coming back and we believe it that's the only thing I used to say the only thing I've never seen was the dead race and eyes open well I've seen the dead raise now worth working God's going to bring our eyes to the place because he's working on it and I believe it but you see I'm bragging on Jesus not trying to convince you brother Dale's got anything but one thing and that's the new birth and if your personal experience in that new bird right that's right man let me contend for that go ahead brother yes I just wanted to testify get this home God I'll cut mine off I apologize but I'm not apologizing because Lord's really helped me um I've had a neurological condition that affected my feet uh for years and uh basically there's a sheath that wraps around all the nerves in your body and then when that sheath begins to deteriorate the nerves go Bonkers and I've set up nights crying with in pain three weeks ago it's been going on since 0-405 three weeks ago I stood there brother Dale brother Wade Brother Dean and brother Al come up and prayed for me and since then my feet have been better than they've been in years I mean I'm talking about master safety and this is the good part it started the journey to 20 year old and made Eternal that's what that's where these feed us where it all ends up the same guy that did that takes his heart thank God he was one year seeking for the baptism and all together okay he was one year seeking for the baptism I'm coming back home okay seeking for the baptism when the Holy Ghost and here's oh me never say it brother Gary you believe the prophet so that's a good evidence never said that matter of fact I guess he thought I was totally contrary to him because he told me something one day that he thought was right and I told him I said no you're wrong he needed just a little lineup to get it right see because I'm not going to argue with you about anything you asked me something I don't agree with it I'll tell you and then I'll tell you why I told him I said quit trying to seek God you know I didn't mean quit seeking the Holy Ghost now you know what I'm saying God always teach you to seek all ago but I said you're trying to figure it out you're doing exactly what I've done yeah when brother Mook stood and told me he said brother Dale what are you doing I said don't ask me I don't know I said I ain't want no tongues and this that and the others and evidence I want a new birth right right amen and then I received it Brother Gary he used to call me coming out I-20 we called it the Battle of I-20 he come out I-20 there holding those films up and down the road you know some Kodiak and all he and he called me one day and he said it's over with itself now I said okay well because he had an experience right amen he'll take care of us that's right he started that 20 year old body there that's right amen when you get the new birth he starts working on that body and once in a while he give you a little witness to it right you know together at you don't have to have nobody to do I just foreign how many of you have heard me say this I'm trying to tell you something I tried to explain the gifts and things to you but I'll just ask you to do something if you'll do it and you believe it it'll work the next time you're sitting listening and God quickened something to you as being right you know really you know hey that's right raise your hand right then and say my family my children my wife my husband yeah my father my mother raise it see if it don't happen I'm trying to tell you about a gift remember I said a minister just has a gift to break the spell that Satan has over your eyes whether God can speak straight to you but when you see something that's being revealed to you and you say Lord I believe that just put it on that and say give him a family right and claim them we have a list downstairs long list of people with names on that privilege you pray every day for those nights you don't have to call every name you know God's got a good memory he knows everyone is put on there you say Lord that list that Wade has right for all of the people that's right amen over a hundred he said what in the world we're going to do daddy if he says I'll let him bring him here we're building out some way he will we'll make out we got a basement we can put up a camera in you know something watch it from there we'll do whatever I'm not worried about that because I was going to quote it while ago when I missed it in my mind brother Ryan said he didn't know how many to be saved in that last moment this is a quote if you want it you don't want me to be saved in that moment last moment two Rapture the church that's right amen you say well how can they do it because they're dependent on you yes yes right he'll put them to the place they're supposed to be he took them on the death Pentecost and put them into a higher level right that's right then he did the three thousand outside that's right he can do it again yeah that's right we are gathering together foreign I could come in and said I'm gonna check you one more time and we'll go he should always hide let's go we can't prove you got it it's our question God I walked into the doctor's office one day and when I had that problem with my eyes and it would wave out you under that I couldn't sleep good really concerned wearing glasses and things I said what are we getting wearing them we're about four or five years or more what I can say get hard to do if I believe thank you praise thank you now thank you
