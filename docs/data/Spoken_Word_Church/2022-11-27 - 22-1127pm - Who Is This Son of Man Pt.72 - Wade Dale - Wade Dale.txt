brother we going to remember them and all the ones that are not here I hate it when there's people are not here because of being sick it's just sickness is to me is sickness is sickening it's just something I don't I don't appreciate the devil it's just him it ain't God now God will allow it to come on you but if you're a son and daughter of God it'll drive you to him it won't drive you away from him all right so we want to thank Brother Richard them and the back back to running with a thin crew to keep this thing going so that we can uh so the ones that can stay that do stay home can receive the services so let's just keep them in prayer let's let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the spirit that you've give us Lord the holy spirit of God we're talking about today Lord that just it just burnt the old us totally annihilated the old and became new so we could walk in newness of Life see things differently Lord listen different look different act different Lord think different father I thank you for the Holy Ghost to give us that Lord that we're not like the world the world's crazy they think we're crazy but the world is totally insane with the things that they're doing Lord I pray that you give us protection now Lord from all these uh looks like covid this part of it coming back but Lord we know one thing for sure you're greater than anything that the devil can put out and father we pray that you would be with brother Hal Thomas Lord today at this moment that you would calm him down Lord let the sweet Sab of the Holy Spirit just cover him Lord and calm him down and let him rest Lord so his body can heal and Lord let him rest so that Sister Janet and the different ones that the family can rest too Lord we pray that we know there's always a family involved in any of these requests and we pray for that family too Lord all the ones that are going through all the different things Lord we pray that you just be with them be with sister Julie and all the ones on the prayer list father we pray that you'd bless them Lord be with the foreign Mission Fields Lord be with the ones that are that are laboring Lord to bring home Souls we pray that you'd be with them Father forgive us of our sins and bless us in Jesus name Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now that's what we got to get to the son of man the word was made flesh brother Brown said the word becoming flesh the flesh becoming word so that's what we're trying to get it back together it got separated in the garden there was enmity there was a division between God and man and it became the carnal mind because the Bible says carnal mind is enmity to God so what we're trying to do is is what transform by the renewing of your mind take that carnal mind out and put the mind of God in all right so let's read Luke 6 verse 19 as we'll get to this one I hope we get to this one virtue called virtue and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the read the word Virtue went out of him to heal them all what a power you know you you talk you watch brother Bri's meetings and I know in Jesus's meetings there was no way that you could record everything because even John right at the end of John The Book of John John says there's no volume that could write what happened during the time of Jesus we just got a little snippet of it or a little or a little highlight of those three and a half years of Jesus's Ministry we just got a highlight but we know that there was more done than what was written in the book the same way now but see we had now a prophet in the end time that they could record I like what said the first time in 1947 he's he said they're trying some one of these new things or this new thing is being and it was a wire recording they started recording and and you know what that developed I'm sorry but it developed in the war in 1945 and a different ones before that World War I communication through the airwaves well you know what that was that was for me and you that was so that the prophet could stand here and they could record his 1100 and something sermons from 1947 to 1965 just for me and you so that we could hear and be the voice hear the voice of the seventh angel and then become that voice all right so virtue went out of him and healed them all so we know that brother ROM in thousands upon thousands upon thousands you would watch him in that one that we got the 20th century Prophet 1950 and he always told us but you can really see it you can see how that that that whatever the people are pulling out of him The Virtue that they're pulling out of him it just drains him dry he never can get through a whole prayer line because why the people are pulling it out of him they're pulling the virtue or the strength from brother brandham and he would always comment on he said he said if Jesus was that way and said who touched me and you know he become weak and all that he said what about me a sinner saved by grace he said what about it happening to me and it did and it happens to all of us if you've ever prayed for somebody and really the spirit of God fall on you you you just you have a weak moment you recover from it but you have a weak moment and you know then brother rown tells us that a sermon about an eight hour worth of work so so you are pretty tired now I always wondered how how that Dad could do it and of course his body's wearing out now bless his heart but but back then he was working 40 and 48 hours a week in a regular job at General Motors didn't have air conditioning none of that stuff he yet didn't um he did Manual Labor and still would come and preach two sermons and then Wednesday night too he never did have any help I mean he'd preach two three months without having a vis and preacher and and U but but your body it does wear your body out but I pray that he gives us he get all of us gives us all Supernatural strength to be able to what make it and we're going to make it somebody is going to make it to that very end and I just believe it's us I just believe it's going to be me and you I believe that we have enough of the power of of God now if brother Brown said we could create a world and go live on it but there's a bar holding us there why we can't do that because of our Humanity at the moment but that humanity is fixing to break folks and when it does we're going out of here and we're taking all the dead Saints with us that all from all down through into Paul's age we're bringing them up and we're all going to March into Glory together all right we're going into another dimension and it's not even going to be glory we talk about going to glory and going to heaven that's for a long way from now everybody with me we got to go through what marriage supper we got to go through a thousand years of of Millennium and then we get to go to the Future home which is the streets of gold which is the Heavenly Gates which is the one we're looking for which is our city and that would be the future home so it's way down the road but boy what we got to start now we got to start now we got to start building it now in this Dimension and you say well we can't do it God listen if God put you in this Dimension and he put put a word in this Dimension he put everything in this dimension for us to get it to the next Dimension something's going to it's going to happen that's right amen we've just got to have enough what strength or virtue you say well I'm just a housewife well I'm just this brother bham even makes it as adoption being a man putting his lunch under his under his under his well of course then they some of y'all that are younger don't remember that but they used to have what was the what was the name of the the wasn't Igloo what was the name of the ther thermos hello it was called but it was a thermos and and you put everything you put soup in it or you put your coffee in it and it would go in a a box that weighed 55 lbs cuz back then it wasn't no such thing as plastic I tell you what I wish I had I wished I had I saw the other day just for your enjoyment before you go to sleep um is mom bought us a in 1960 probably five or six when we first started school or I first started school she bought me a Batman in lunchbox probably paid about $1.50 for it do you know how much them things sell on aay eBay now four and $500 if you got an original one and we just throw that thing everywhere a lot of stuff we had back then cuz we're considered old amen thank you and it had a mini thermos in it but that's what brother R was talking about but when you listen to the kids really when you listen a lunchbox under his arm going to work that literally happened or you'd have your little tote you know with the thermos on top and and and you open it up and you had sand listen wasn't many McDonald's back then what in a what in a convenience store on every corner come on now you got what you got at home if your wife didn't make it you didn't get it but brother M talks about that and it's so simple as being coming to adoption it's knowing where you're at knowing your place and when you do go to work there's virtue that goes to work with you and people can say hey can you pray for me hey when you go to church even though they may not ever go to church the day in their life they know you do and they can say hey will you pray for me will you pray for so how many prayer requests do we get from people that don't even come to church here almost about half right why is that it's not because they think you're a drunk it's not because they think you're a pill what we all call Pill Popper back when we coming up uh-uh no they think you they know you've got some strength or at least you got a good connection you know I knew dad had a good connection with God and if I ever got in trouble that's exactly where I went and finally one day I couldn't find him and I had to go to the heavenly father hello somebody you got to get to your heavenly father first your Earthly father would do anything in the world take a bullet for you have his head chopped off for you but he can't save your soul but your heavenly father can so that's the one you need to cry out to as your heavenly father but it gives us enough virtue to where people can look that that even we were talking about this in Jude this morning about that we should what earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints so what we've got to do is is when we're here looking at the Statue of perfect man we do have to now it's not bad it is bad to look back for certain way but it's not bad to look back to the first church age because it tells you it tells you to do that you must earnestly contend contend for the faithful which was once delivered to the Saints so we what we go to the book of Acts maybe next Sunday or so we'll go to the book of Acts and see what they acted like that's why it's called the book of Acts because it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the people so if the Holy Ghost is the same and they had the virtues working in their life all we got to do is read the book of Acts and there's our part there's our place to read and that's our place to get something that is the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints which now is and do you know why it works better there I say better they had no denominational idea they had these virtues working in their life all right so they had these virtues working in their life so they got something amen 100% of the New Testament was written back there under that that Faith anointing all the old test New Testament was written right there right from the book of Acts on up Luke Paul different ones you look at your books now we know Matthew and them were written about Jesus but remember all those four gospels were written after Jesus died or after he ascended right so you're looking back to that faith that was once delivered to the Saints and even they told Brother Ram one time they said Oh Brother R you can write 23rd chapter of Revelations he said that sounded good he said but it he said it's false you can't add to the word God's written everything he's going to write and that's all he's going to write he's not going to write anymore that's why brother Bri I said brother around didn't bring any new revelation or new doctrine it was the doctrines that was already in the Bible what had happened man had went and put their own interpretation to it there was no virtue left in some of those things God's not going to honor a false Doctrine so what virtue can you get out of a false Doctrine now he listen he did wink at their ignorance he did let them and allow them to be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost cuz that's all they knew but not that first church not that first first church not the first church they didn't believe in eternal hell they didn't believe in all these dogmas and doctrines that came from NAA from 300 years after Jesus went off the scene until 600 and those those doctrines were established and they're still there it's just it's just pitiful to see that that the denominational world looks at the mother and and know she's the they know Rome's the but they don't read that she had daughters she's got daughters that drink of the same cup that she drinks of that's how it's so close to the deceive the very last so God had to send us a prophet to pull us out from under that come out of her my people all right come out of those ideas and those doctrines those trinitarian ideas which brother R said came from the pits of Hell any false Doctrine you can have somebody come up here and preach their heart out and if it's a false Doctrine it did not come from God right it came from hell it came from a demon that got a hold of you now not saying nothing about the brother or sister you can get a demon on you and be born again come on somebody if you don't believe that you got one on you now got you quiet there didn't I but anything contrary to the word of God is a devil and it's false all right but God winked at their ignorance he winked at man pushing their Doctrine but he said I'm going to have a people in the end time that's going to what Malachi 4 restore the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers so he took the what Babylon Pentecostal babies and brought the faith of the fathers back which was what uh Matthew Mark Luke John um Paul irenius all those all those ones back there that didn't have doctrinal issues boy would be nice wouldn't it Bob it'd be nice to be back there and be the first church age and you go to somebody's church and you preach and they're all you know amen and then you go to the next church and it's all amen you go to the next church it's all amen now you can go to a church and you preach a little Doctrine a little something extra and you won't get old man you'll get a right foot of Fellowship out the door but that didn't happen in the first church age why did it happen it happened because they got an idea so Corinthians got an idea during irenius his time that what that Jesus wasn't exactly God all right Bob's read it many times where serenus would say well he's kind of a like substance of God well see that was a seed in irenius is day but if you'll look in irenius his day you come up to 300 that thing just went right over into NAA serenus may have never been to NAA he may have died before that happened but remember demons don't die they just go right over into somebody else which goes right over into somebody else which went right over to NAA and what Satan loves numbers he gathered them all together and said this is what we're going to do all right I don't know how I got off on that but that's okay but that's what we got to be restored back to though that Faith because there's no virtue in father son Holy Ghost come on people there's no virtue in that there's no virtue in a false Doctrine can't be so to to to begin with right here at to get-go The Virtue that we have to have has to be proven word-based virtue not word sometimes word-based virtue it's got to be word-based virtue to get the dunamus dunamus is Holy Ghost holy ghost power that's what we're looking at here I want us to get this right here down pat amen then when we get this Pat we're going to have a church that's got adopted Sons and Daughters of God we're not going to be what we're not going to be immune from everything but I promise you we'll know more how to handle it we'll know more how to what defeat the Devil right that's what I'm looking for you can look for that if you want to that's why I wanted people baptized I want people with the Holy Ghost I want us to have prayer meetings I want us to have things to where we can get people involved in God not involved in a church amen involved in God and God will drive you here you get involved with God he'll put you here amen everybody all right with that greatest battle ever fought I believe the greatest battle that ever fought is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers and he's been dressing them training them the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start getting ready to start 1962 because the greatest battle because look let me put it this way brother Brandon was preaching in a in a time frame hear me out just a second he he was preaching in a time frame or a dispensation now he believed in dispensations right he was trying to take those old Pentecost which were babbling babies all they thought about was speaking in tongues and and carrying on in church and he was trying to feed them the word he was trying to bring them over and bring them into what the word of God pure adulterated everybody with me but they wanted to either stay there or bring their ideas with them all right cuz he was preaching when he preached he didn't preach the message Believers folks most people didn't want to even see his message they wanted to see the signs and wonders afterwards I'm just telling you what some said has been in the meeting wanted him to hurry up and get finished with the message so he could what that was the open Pentecostal way I got to see some signs and wonders but see because when brother R then though when he did go back and pick up that faith and pick up that message and start bringing it that's when he said himself he said hundreds will leave me thousands will leave me preach marriage and divorce he said my friends are going to leave me by droves in other words hundreds of people are going to and they did from preaching to 50,000 to preaching to 25 or 30 in a trailer out in Arizona and preach some good messages too preach the M Rapture message out there but God's going to get the message out they're not going to hinder it man's not going to hinder it the devil's not going to hinder it and me and you are not going to hinder it we can sit there s push face all we want to God is going to move on all right and you know what if we don't move with him as they say in the movies say because it's your choice we go back to your choice to follow him or not all right but this thing's got to be quickened inside of our heart that's why I wanted to lay that foundation for for months now trying to get us right there equipped for this battle because it's a going to be a battle it has already begun in most of our Lives it is a battle I know it's a battle to get to church I know it's a battle to do things for God you know why cuz it's a battle for me me but you know his old man said one time he said well he said I uh I stayed out kind of late Saturday night at doing whatever going to ball game or something you know he said well well you know I I prayed and and and I think I'll just come you know I'll just skip this weekend and and and uh and I'll just uh I don't think the Lord will bother that you know like no go back to the will of God the will of God is the word of God now I want to ask you a question whatever you do in your life outside of here is your business well not exactly but if you get doing wrong stuff it is going to be our business okay if we start hearing back but you understand what I'm saying if you like to do I like to hunt so I'm not going to squish you if you don't hunt and you don't squish me if I do but I'll promise you one thing if I was a Hunter and I got out on Saturday night and I C hunted till 3:00 in the morning that's no excuse for me not to be in church on Sunday right right I have made my own excuse yeah but I was with Brothers well they that you don't ever sin alone but you you understand what I'm saying so the same thing with with what we do as as Christians we we we should prepare oursel for God first all right we should make sure on Saturday night that our car is full of gas I'll promise you if you're going to the doctor tomorrow morning you're going to stop by before you go home and make sure you got enough gas in your car and everybody's shaking their head I see you yeah because you know that you're not going to get up you're not going to get up in time to go anyway but so to get the gas so you're going to get it tonight well same way with with church what you saying this is what I'm talking about virtue virtue is strength strength is what we get from the things we do I've got to believe though Michael I've got to believe though that when I do those things I do make sure that I prepared I do make sure that I maybe get a good night's rest somebody sometimes you always don't get a good I rest on Saturday night okay but you at least you're not going to be out with 3:00 in the morning you know hunting whatever you're doing and then you're going to sleep halfway through through church that's right that's virtue you decide what virtue is because you put the strength in it think about this with me for a minute you put the strength in it when I was a sinner I put my strength and my virtue in ball games and then whatever something in the sports realm or something hunting or and I used to hunt I'd hunt on Saturday hunt on Sunday so I didn't have to come to church I'm just being honest I'd do things on Sunday I'd schedule things on Sunday so my mama wouldn't have to call and say you come to church tomorrow oh Mom I'm going to be hunting I'm sorry about that but see that's but I I drew strength from that that thing that it was inside of me was drawing strength from that now I'm not saying it was good but now that I believe I've got God inside of me that virtue now is all that is totally secondary this is first so The Virtue and strength I've taken from out there I put here yes and that to me that's the most simple thing but it's the hardest thing we can ever do is put your trust in something you can't see something that's so powerful but you know what that woman did we're reading in just a little while you know the story she saw Jesus she never probably went to a sermon but she heard that he had strength she heard maybe two days ago she had been to the gate and there was a blind man called barnas and man she saw him walking around the temple not blind so she put strength in that and somebody says Jesus is going to come through this way Sunday morning at 10: and at 2: Wednesday night at 7:00 we know where God's going to be so what did she do she didn't go to Walmart she didn't schedule her a trip somewhere else she made sure she was right there and when she when he walked by there was so many people but like I said before she was unclean there was nothing that she could sit on that was clean she was unclean and they just got out of her way cuz she was an unclean woman had been for 12 years so they knew who she was and she just crawled right up there and all she done was just touch the Garment and what did Jesus say who touched me wow somebody quit for the battle you said well we're not Jesus you got that same guy that same guy that got weak come on somebody is inside of you today not another person not a lesser person that same person is inside of you in your human flesh that was God in human flesh and when she touched the Garment she was healed that's why when they went to the gate beautiful and then they they were um they took uh cloths off of Paul and put them on people that was virtue that was that was Paul the Apostle we've seen the healing we've seen these why brother BR that's why he could stand and make this statement that I've been telling you forever and ever the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass Peter said look on us don't look over there don't look down at you in other words he said don't look down at your situation don't look down and see all the world and what they're laughing and and you know we're we're they're hunting us anyway you know they want to lock us up everywhere they went they want to lock them up right don't look anywhere else he said look at us and then the guy you know what the guy did what they said and when he looked on them guess what he got healed and virtue had went out of them and it never said that he touched them right Silver and Gold Have I None now remember they did pick him up and help him get his strength back but there were certain times when you don't listen you don't have to touch that's right you touch the feeling of your infirmities God does that what supernaturally where they don't have to be a connection that's why we can pray for brother how 20 mil or 15 miles from here and know that God's going to that situation all right and and like I said before one more time sister Janet she didn't she didn't call the local convenience store hey pray for my dad why there was no virtue now there's virtue to the drunk he wants to go to that convenience store he knows he's going to get his strength from that convenience store he's going to buy him a lottery ticket smoke him a vape and buy him some booze that's his strength no Sister Janet sent a text she said could y'all have a special prayer so guess what the virtue and strength that we have went to that and we're going to expect that it does what it's supposed to do amen so God has equipped this then for the battle here's Paul for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds you know I was thinking the other day what an eort you know it it takes us an effort to get to church is what I just saying all right and we're whole and we're we've got good cars and we've got U full stomachs and and we come in here and Michael got some nice Cut suits on and uh who said uh-huh yeahuh you notice that too it'll get you somewhere but we see all that but but think about somebody that just has to believe somebody in a foreign country who can't do that who can't get in a car who has to walk to church for 10 miles are those people to get in brother Brown's meetings are the people to get in Jesus's meeting them two friends really love that guy they tore a roof off of a house and dropped that man right down in front of Jesus two friends did it cuz he couldn't do it wow have we ever done that before to get somebody to be healed or get somebody to come to church no if we can't get the door open sometimes we don't come can't get the air conditioner to work right I mean honestly how many of y'all would come to church if it was 95 degrees in here all the time don't raise your hand I know some of you wouldn't casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God that's why brother ran he said the right mental attitude in other words folks y'all have done the right thing you have come to the right place you have come in ambulances you have come in stretchers people have had to brought you in here remember that one girl that she was bleeding so bad till he had to go out to the to the um car said she's bleeding to death but guess what that woman's Living Well she might be now but she was living back then why cuz she had she knew where the virtue was at she knew where that that pipeline was and that's what you and I in virtue we've got to not not see seen things it's unseen there's no way you could put Jesus out in a crowd and say oh that man's got virtue it had to be something Supernatural but what did they have to do and I'm going to read something to you in just a few minutes or maybe a little bit there had to be something known about him before that everybody with me amen there had to be something known beforehand because we're going to read here in the Book of Ruth where where Boaz says the whole Community knows thou art a virtuous one woman the whole Community wow knows th are a virtuous woman we'll read it in just a minute look and having Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled like I said before it's an effort but wow what kind of a what are you going to get you're going to get eternal life but you're going to get you say well brother way you you're you're you're preaching the power of positive thinking I hope so if it's mixed with faith if it's mixed with the Holy Ghost you going to be a powerful Army you're going to be somebody undefeatable you going to be somebody like brother Brown says Satan don't even know what to do with you you know what I hope he gets the frustrated he don't know what to do with us I hope he I hope he gets so mad I do till he tries to do something to to the bride and God's going to say no not that group you make can get to that group but you're not getting to that group but you got to make sure you're in that group we can't just say we're bride no you got to fight on your hands that's right you got to fight to get here according as his divine power we read that this morning let's and besides this besides your new birth besides you um hollering and screaming at the at the altar for God to save your soul and he does and he fills you with the Holy Ghost he burns all that old part of you out you still got to add add to your faith I mean why did you come to church to get saved I know some may not have but well I did this is where strength is this is where the virtue is right here not somewhere else I know you can kneel down and at a convenience store and if somebody's got the Holy Ghost they can pray for you you but there ain't a whole lot of many well ain't many Holy Ghost fied people hangs around a convenience store all the time usually it's the other ghost people that hangs around the convenience store every once in a while but when we start talking about virtue You' got to know where it's at and then you got to know who's got it and you can draw from it we can draw virtue from the word of God but folks let me tell you something brother rown tell tells us he said the seed life comes through the body Paul oh I'm sorry Saul Saul had every one of these Old Testament books now not the new but you understand the whole Old Testament the Torah Paul was so versed in those he knew everything he said and according to the law blameless so why didn't God just save him on the road to Damascus nope he sent him into town amen he said you go find or in words you go sit there and I'm going to find somebody and nice I'm going to find somebody that a seed life is already quickened in his body he's already filled with the Holy Ghost to pray for you to get the Holy Ghost so that's why the seed life comes through the body as a body of Believers you have to go from one to the other to chain reaction everybody with me on that that's what Paul had to do he was versed he knew every one of these script you know this one more time you know this whole message up one side down the other if you can't live the life you're I'm sorry add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and that add is Minister nourishment see you brother Bri talks about being a Christian and and then Jesus talks about the tears and all the different things you know about some of them you know they get put in Stony ground and some of them get in some kind of ground and some kind of the other ground some in good ground well well they grow up to a certain spot and then they can't make it any further and even the Bible says the cares of Life the cares of life and maybe sometimes our family gets in the way I hope somebody said oh yeah cuz everybody boy you start talking about people family and they go not my kids not my wife if your wife ain't in church and ain't full of the Holy Ghost she's lost kids either you either me either it's time to tell it like it is study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not be ashamed I'm not ashamed to preach now I used to I used to think man I'd be ashamed if by certain preacher I'm not now I'm not some and and Daddy's watching in he knows sometimes I sit there and go man it's like brother Claude said he said I just knew there was heads going to be hitting the floor and I could hear them you know cutting your head off but don't be ashamed for that that's what we were given a place in here to do amen we were given a place in here to cut you and you never know it right until you look down and you're bleeding and then when you go outside you go oh okay that was me he was talking about right don't you have you ever done that before yes sir I have and you have too you get cut and it's like oh man oh that was me but that look that needeth not be ashamed I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed of the of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed to living this life that I'm living are you if you're ashamed to living a life if you're living then change that's right get in the word of God get born again a Workman that needeth not be ashamed look rightly dividing the word of Truth you say man you're not supposed to divide the word up no you're not but why does the bible tell us that it's a two-edged sword cutting a under what's it doing it cutting that little stuff off you know the other day when I was skinning my deer you know you you you get this great big glob of hair you're cutting your skin in the deer you got a big old knife when you get to debone in it you get a smaller knife because you got to work a lot more tedious to get all the bones out of it well you're still rightly dividing the deer it's just the deer you're and you're cutting it up in smaller pieces and that's what you and I a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth because listen sometimes the word will choke you sometimes the word word will choke you and you don't want to do that you don't want to choke people you don't want to as brother dick said you don't want to bruise fruit but sometimes you do but you want to rightly divide the word of Truth and say okay Lord I'm going to preach to this group of people today you divided in how it needs to be divided cuz I you know you go you go preach brother Bob different ones brother Luis and them they're getting ready to go overseas but they've never preached in these pull pits before but you want God to rightly divide even if it's in another language and they're a thousand miles away God can still be working on both ends I love that about God I love that about the Holy Ghost I love that about the way God operates that he'll absolutely send you somebody and and you'll swear that that Pastor has took him into the study and told him your whole life right see folks that's why I and you know some people when you do that to some that don't have that don't have the Holy Ghost or there are they real um soft Christians it hurts their feelings and they leave for a little while don't ever leave if you're a child of God it was a spanking you needed it was a spanking I needed and it hurt hurt my will feelings but it because I was a child my daddy corrected me because I was his child and boy y'all are real lucky you guys that are kids now because when I was growing up every parent was my mom and daddy hello somebody what n this you leave my little baby alone no my daddy said if he needs it tear him up I'll tear him up when he gets home and I'll promise you do y'all know anything about whipping in church I mean in in school oh some of the other on well the other ones don't if I got a whiping in school I got a whiping at home and if I didn't tell him course I think I only got one Terence him tell me about all of them and got a whole bunch so one I I got one too and Mr White he tore me up goodness gracious see I still remember that and I didn't do whatever that was that I got in trouble for but my brother bless his heart they wore him out so anyway he's watching in and he's laughing which is good maybe they need to laugh right now they're not feeling very well but that's the way it worked around my house I knew if I got a whipping somewhere else or if if I was at Granny's house granny boy you don't whip your grandkids that's for sure no it wasn't my granny my granny had a broom didn't she my granny had a broom and she knew how to use it at a long distance she's 88 years old she can't I mean she could get up pretty quick but she'd be sitting there and you'd be doing something you're like I can beat her out the door no you can't cuz here come the broom why am I telling you this I'm telling you these stories because I respected my granny because of the virtue that she had she wasn't going to let you get by with nonsense my dad and mom W going to let me get by with nonsense so how is our heavenly father going to let us get by with nonsense he's not he's going to whip us and he's going to whip us not going to beat us he's going to whip us with nail Scar and hands but you know what we can be a rebellious his child and just keep doing it over and over again or we can say hey I I'm done with that I don't think I'm going to do that anymore cuz it's the same result is that what what is it what's uh Insanity doing the same thing over and over expecting a different results some of us need to work on that I see me but these virtues look what moral Excellence it's going to listen this is going to make you a better person going up these stat this statue of perfect man and asking God not only in your Christian life but in your newly married life and and let me give this as a side note as a hashtag Lily didn't break his arm no he did that on his his own he was a little bit roofed and um so it's not they had a fight I told her I said listen when y'all have a fight when you're newly with you need to put the mark where nobody can see it right d not on your hand not where some Mak and you hold go oh my word so anyway it's going to make your life better listen how many times have you seen that I've seen people out in the world like brother R said that had some of these virtues that that were just rank Sinners I saw a man and a woman not too long ago in the paper that I'd known from years and years and years ago I think it was a picture of them together and they were I knew they weren't Christians but they just loved each other and they were like in their 80s and and he would help her and she' help him that's good but we're looking for a life past that we're look and we can draw virtue from that I can draw virtue my dad my father-in-law is a good businessman and I can draw virtue from some of the things that he tells me but now as far as being a Christian he's never been one so I'm not going to sit there and listen to him tell me about how to get saved why would you do that he don't even know how to do it himself but if somebody's got saved if somebody studied like brother Dale for 40 50 years listen to them they got something for you there's little there's little tidbits of things I'm just going to talk about life today there's just little tidbits of things even sister C and different one and and sister Trudy will throw out there and sometimes you don't understand them because they're way ahead of me in years too but but you go man wisdom wow right and that's where I want to go I call my hey I need some help amen call brother down I need some help call somebody with some wisdom I need some help but that's moral Excellence value Merit merous worth specifically moral Excellence Integrity now that would be as the world talks about virtue as far as and I listen don't get me wrong brother random said that that this virtue is not talking about being a virgin is everybody with me but it does have something to do with it some I'm not I'm not against brother random don't put that anywhere I'm just saying he's making a point he's separating it from what the world sees to what God sees but I can take that virtuous woman I'm going to talk about over here in in um Psalms or in in um Proverbs and bring it right back to me and you a virtuous woman that's right let's be playing a minute if you knew a if you knew a girl and we always I'm sorry let's say boy we always talk about the girls let's talk about the guys if you had this guy that was just a uh Liv as brother Claud said a hound dog life you knew all he wanted was to do one thing would you let your daughter grow out with him why he's a nice looking guy why you knew his background you knew what somebody said that somebody said that somebody said amen what kind of virtue is in that that's not moral Excellence that's immorality so you look at that you even in your life we look and see to not let those things happen please pray cuz you know what honestly we do we we we beat the girls up about being loose and promiscuous it takes the dude first okay everybody with me somebody out here takes the dude first the guy the man okay so let's just don't give it all to one side it's like Daddy said we call a woman a or a and then if the guy she's with puts on a suit and goes to church on Sunday you would call him a deacon that ain't right no that ain't right takes two so virtue it's going to change our thinking cuz I'm going to skip through this and not be so long today let me skip through this cuz we've already we've already seen all these talk about the heart we talking about the heart this morning remember the heart is your soul that's not this thing beaten right here it's your soul it's who you are as a man think is in his heart so is he and listen from your heart you're believing this Doctrine today you have obeyed made from your heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you God delivered a prophet to us that delivered a message to us that has what it has virtue in it man if you don't draw strength out of this message you're not in the message the real one man what kind of strength and power does this does this message have what drawing power does it have but it's not drawing power to the whole world right somebody's going to find something wrong with it but if you have obeyed from your heart that form of Doctrine we all have a Doctrine we all are under a Doctrine brother R said if the church don't have a Doctrine they're not a church so we have a Doctrine it's the message of the hour the truth of the message of the hour anybody with me so from our heart we believe that see that's what draws me here not family not you I like fellowshipping with y'all but I come here because the form of Doctrine which I am obeying from my soul is to get here that's why brother Brown says you can't wait till those doors open to get here why because it's drawing it's a draw if you don't have that draw and that passion in your heart you're lost sorry I'm sorry but that's the truth cuz if brother R said that we must believe it so you obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you now we have been delivered that Doctrine everybody with me all right and we see that there is virtue in it right there's virtue in this Doctrine we're going to skip a bunch of this CU we' got about right here this morning we believe in this Doctrine I rest my soul on Malachi 4 that's what brother wither Rose always said and we do rest our soul in this message of the hour listen if this is not right we're all lost we're all absolutely the most deceived people in the world if this is not the right message but they're deceived if this is the right message if this is the right message and that's what we're putting our faith on and I'm not putting my faith on William BR I'm put my faith on he brought me God himself not a second person not a third person but the person of God he brought me to have a personal relationship with God so that I can draw virtue from that that we listen God met William brandom on a platform I'm just going to preach a minute he met William brandom on a platform all the time in the form of the Holy Ghost in the form of a light brother R said he's no more than three feet from where I'm standing he he didn't say it he said he where is that God of Elijah it's right here at the platform no more than three feet from where I'm standing well I don't see it none of them other people saw it either he said can't you see that light over that woman and they're all going no why it wasn't time for them I think it's time for me and you to start seeing that light to see that Pillar of Fire and have it work not just stay out there though I wanted to go in here but that was a conduit that God used to move brother brand and I it's an experience I've never experienced but where the brother Brandon would say something and he said my lips will go numb and I won't know what I said there's a lot of people a lot of psychologists to tell you that's not good that you don't know what you're saying but he put so much dependent on that being God and him never lying and never not telling the truth he had so much confidence he said hey use me use me right don't it makes me weak though it makes me where I don't understand sometimes brother R said the other day a while back he said I had to go back and listen to the tape again to see what I said he had to go back and listen to the tape to see what he said he had so removed self out of the way but did you did when we were looking at that at that video did you see some little you know little ghost thing go over here to the side no it all happened on the inside it happened in his heart in his soul he just for one second moved himself out of the way and let he even let God have his memory reason conscious effect and Imagination it can happen again it's going to have to happen for us to go up the statute of perfect man going to have to happen for us to have power with character We Believe brother R had power with character don't you where is that God of Elijah then where like Elisha aren't we Elisha brother M said we type elishah that's right he took that manle and he smoked that water and he said where be the god of Elijah well he was in Elisha so he's in me and you God of this evil 1965 brother Bram said the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by he said six senses or five rather the Inside Man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscious Love talk about memory reason conscious f imagination outside castes feel smelling here but the inside of that spirit is a soul everybody with me and it's controlled by one thing you read it your free will your free will you see I believe brother brandom knew he knew was a prophet he had to know all the supernatural things but he he was so humble he wasn't going to say anything about it well I'm a prophet of this end time bless God and you got to hear me no God wouldn't use somebody like that he used somebody was so humble that he just let it and may I say he just let it ooze out and we caught it we caught the scent of that we're going to talk about in just a minute Mr Reverend Mr Lily or Reverend Mr flower you don't have to go out there to rose bush and say hey I want you to smell like a rose when you you know when you Blossom out no I don't have to go out there and tell the ochre plant hey you better give me some okra no if you'll do the right thing you'll get okra cuz that's what you planted so here brother brandham is he has put all of his will on to God and he says use me it scares some people to death to have God use them because that's a strange thing think about that I'm glad you're quiet you can accept what the devil says or you can accept What God Says and look and that'll determine what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything of the world we talked about memory reason conscious effects and Imagination we know that this will affect our senses this will affect memory reason and conscious affection and Imagination everybody with me this will change you you say I've Been Changed yeah you've been changed by the new birth but Peter said add Peter said add to that change uh come up a little higher where God can use you more y'all look at me crazy sometimes when I look outside and I see a I drive down the road and I see an animal laying dead on the side of the road that somebody run over I caused that you caused that you did I did because of our carnal mind but guess what all that's groaning and waiting for it to be turned back to where Adam didn't have to look on side of a road and see a dead possum he didn't have to look and see a dead animal it was all life that's what we're going back to now inside of that Spirit which you become when you're born in the earth now look inside of that Spirit which you become when you're born in the Earth the Breath of Life is breathed into you that Spirit watch this that spirit is always Eternal that's not what it says does it some of y'all that are sleep need to wake up that spirit is of a what worldly nature because it was not given from God you have to be careful with what he's saying but it was given or permitted by God everybody with me cuz he didn't put eternal life in you when you were born that proves it right there I know I didn't have it and I know you didn't have it okay you said well I got these quotes you better make them match the Bible they better match the Bible they don't match the Bible then you got it wrong okay that spirit is of a worldly nature why carnal mind you were born in sin shaped in iniquity you were born by sex you were born by carnal nature everybody with me but it did come from God it was permitted by God it was perfect but not Eternal you were not born here with eternal life there was only one guy that happened too and that's the Lord Jesus Even Adam had to have the eternal life put inside out of him all right but it permitted by God now watch this now you get that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shap in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with now this is 1960 and5 this is after the seals broke and he's still preaching salvation that you were a sinner when you were born so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with now it's got five endless and then five endless endless I don't know whether I can call them or not but the first I know is thought conscious he means memory reason conscious affection imagination there's five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscious in your body this it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being cuz reason doesn't see taste feel smell hair reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason he didn't mean dead by dead he means asleep all right there's five senses that control that Inside Man and now to the last man he's talking about the spirit realm he talked about the body Spirit now he's talking about the soul now to the last man which is the soul there's only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency free will to choose or to reject so you do have something to do with this everybody with me on that listen to what brother Bown says he's praying a prayer listen our Heavenly Father Here lays before me a bunch of handkerchiefs they represent poor six suffering people one of these glorious days it's all going to be over and we're going to come up to your house God help us to be in the deepest of sincerity now bless us now I lay hands on these handkerchiefs thou knowest there's no virtue in any man but the virtue he look at the parentheses there was no virtue in the serpent nor in the brass that was made out of or the pole he's talking about when God told him to put the serpent on the pole and if you looked at that that you were healed that's why if you look today on Physicians doors and you look on anything to do with a with a doctor he there's a snake running up a pole that's exactly why cuz there's healing in that there's not healing in that it was what but the virtue was doing what God Said do the virtue was that they believed in Moses they listen what did they say they said Moses we don't want to talk to God you go talk to God in whatever he tells you you tell us and we'll do it now we know they didn't always do that but what did they do they put enough had enough um confidence in Moses to where when Moses walked up one day and said look y'all are dying by the thousands y'all are dying of this plague God told me to put this serpent on a pole and put it out in front he said if you look at that you'll live and then they started looking that and they all started Living they all started getting rid of their diseases they all started getting rid of all these things why it was because the virtue in that was doing what God Said to do that's why brother Brown says full obedience right full obedience to the word in other words brings you full adoption it brings you to full age it brings you to it brings you to a place of maturity right full obedience not part full obedience what God Said do and I'm going to tell you that's just part of all of our problem we don't do 100% of what God tells us to do all right blind bass 1954 we'll read this and we'll stop right here I think I think the shite woman went to Elijah and Elijah took the staff and sent it to Gaz and said lay it upon the child now Elijah knew that whatever he touched when he had the anointing of the spirit on him that it was blessed and I think that's what Paul Paul did and that's what the people saw it wasn't Paul it was the god on Paul and just a token or a symbol of faith in other words the clothes that Paul wore you see so they taken from his body handkerchiefs and aprons that's where I think we got this right he from brother brandham was talking about prayer claw way before that we knew anything about oursel right he would cut up prayer cloth and send them for free that's what the IRS was telling said you getting paid for these he said ' don't charge a dime he said what is the what do you call it trinkets or something they said this what is this thing you're sending out in the mail and he took them back to the scripture at Acts 19 said they took they took cloth off of Paul and they sent him out prayed over him sent him out and evil spirits left now the evil spirits didn't leave because of this cloth it was the power of prayer before the cloth it was the virtue of knowing that somebody earnestly prayed that these things work it's not a Hocus Pocus it works it's what God told us to do right and diseases went from the people what is that what would you imagine the people some people touched the Garment of Jesus and was made well others smacked him in the face and hit him in the head with sticks and spit on him never felt any virtue at all it was their attitude of approach it depends on what attitude you come in not the preacher not your neighbor it's What attitude you come in if you come believing that you're coming to get help and you're confident that you're coming to the right person Jesus Christ and you're coming his provided way of approach you're going to receive something if you come reverently if you come well I'll just go touch and see if it helps me that's not what that woman said she said if I could but touch to him of His Garment I'll be made well you know what that was her that was her voice saying I have got faith in what that man is Right same way with me and you sister hadie right didn't have a penny two nickel to rub together had two sons that were out in the world doing worldly things she said that ain't nothing brother Brown that ain't nothing but the truth he said sister God's pleased with that you ask anything you want he said she could have had Fortune Beyond Fortune there a sister sister edth her sister was sitting there in a wheelchair he said but she asked what she supposed to ask for something Eternal the salvation of my two sons and from The Virtue that was in what in what brother Brown said but it was a virtue and what she said she said brother Brown that ain't nothing but the truth and God said hey honor that hello somebody God said honor that my Prophet give her what she wants right just like the brass serpent while the serpent didn't have no virtue in it it was a piece of brass this is the cloth they brought it out of Egypt neither did the Paul have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what God Said do what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God brother M says look we're not building an organization statue perfect man I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse not the jelly bag the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his own word by his word see build up the individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea see add to your faith virtue to your virtue at knowledge well now we're coming to a place let me read this real quick then we'll start back over Sunday Luke 6: 19 or read it before the whole multitude sought to touch him and there went virtue out of him and healed them all then we hear that the woman said what somebody touch me I perceive that virtue what vert that is strength the Greek word is dunamus just like when Jesus spoke the day he left this Earth he said go to Jerusalem and you shall receive power from on high that same word power is the same word Virtue is the same word that means dunamus or power Mighty work strength ability inherit power power for performing Miracles moral power and Excellence of Soul come on skip over and read down to the very bottom cuz I want to get to this then we'll back up don't look at that it make you sick all right right here I pulled these out the other night and I thought man look at this Ruth 3:1 and now my daughter fear not now this is Boaz talking to Ruth everybody with me just for a second then musicians get ready to come on and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest what she had said hey I need you to I need you to do the right of a Kinsman I need you to get the property of of my mother-in-law back and Boaz was the only one that could do it for all the city of my people now look Ruth is a moot an outs scourer the whole whole country of Moab was started by incest between lot and his two daughters brother Bram said a hair and the biscuit kind of a gaggy thing that's illegal now but that started Moab she comes out she's a moabit she's not of the House of Israel she has no inheritance but she married a Jew she married a Jew husband died you know the story her father-in-law died so there's nobody but Naomi and Ruth and Naomi had some property because remember the first thing happened was is they took him down out of the country because the famine was great so now they're back well now they're back the husbands have died so as as part of the r of redemption somebody's got to claim that land everybody with me so they move back in and here Naomi they got this little one room apartment maybe as we say now one room apartment and Naomi everybody knows who she is cuz she's from there but Ruth they don't have no clue but the first thing Ruth does is it says Hey Hey Mama Hey mother-in-law how many y'all would do that hey mother-in-law just saying yeah yeah Louise tell them Louise yeah hey mother-in-law what do I need to do how can I help you what a wonderful at just an attitude she wasn't a born again believer she wasn't in the message of the hour but she was truthful to her mother-in-law she said hey your husband's dead my husband's dead we're in a bad way here I know there's some property over here that'll help you survive cuz you're an older lady I might conf find me another husband but you can't you're old so what can I do to help you so what do she do she says okay go out to this field just short story go out to this field that's my cousin cousin or that's my my brother or something they were kin folks right Boaz and her were kin to each other or the husband of and that property had to be redeemed back to somebody we know the right of redemption that would be Boaz but remember Naomi is not the one that instigates this whole thing she's behind the scene she's Jerusalem that's right she's the Jews that's right and she's behind the scene and she's orchestrating she said hey go out to that field out there and just just kind of pick up we got to eat just kind of pick up some stuff make sure you do it in boaz's field pick up some stuff well guess what everybody's got their eye on this new girl come on somebody everybody She's Strange she probably wasn't dark skinned or darkhaired like all the Jews she probably come from moabit and she was probably blond-headed and real thin skinned and she looked totally different cuz she wasn't of this group that's here she was totally out of their tribe so everybody's looking cuz remember Boaz had to tell them say look don't touch her you put hands full of purpose out there but you leave her alone whatever she needs you give it to her but watch what he says right here for all the city of my people does know that thou art a virtuous woman how do they know that I didn't know that there was no book no history behind Ruth Naomi didn't get out in the street and say hey you need to come see Ruth she's a real nice girl they saw it in her they saw it in Ruth they saw it in her obedience they saw it in what she needed to do to get her mother-in-law hey that's what we're doing Ruth is the top of us we're trying our best to get Boaz here so that he can give the baby to the Jews so he can give the Holy Ghost to the 144,000 we're holding the whole thing up but that's all right for th my city my neighbors the whole town does know that thou art a virtuous woman and listen you say well that doesn't mean anything yeah it means power amen sisters brothers we always talk about sisters here again sister s and brothers if you keep yourself and you're a virgin that's power that is power that is control over yourself so to me virtue is power but virtue is mean that you live a virgin life aren't we supposed to be Virgin live virgin life aren't we supposed to be The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ we're the woman Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but but she that maketh ashamed is his rotness in his bones see we are the crown of Jesus Christ not the denominations not the not this old sinful world because you know what they could be his bride they're women those other churches are women they're even though they're Harlot they're women and they could become a virtuous woman by accepting in the message of the hour but they won't do it so it's become rotness in his bone but a virtuous woman is a crowned or a husband so virtue is strength listen to this right here virtue always it always means righteous and just so if you'll take the word Virtue in the Bible and you'll run it through um strongs it comes up with all the remember it says these scriptures are used the same meaning righteous and just all the way through the the Bible means virtuous means virtue a virtuous person exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason and character you got to have both The Virtuous person not only knows what the good thing to do is he or she is also emotionally attached to it I like that he or she is emotionally not just that I'm virtuous no I'm proud that I'm virtuous I'm proud that I'm a virt to Christ that gives me what power that gives me strength what to beat the devil up with let's stand to our feet God bless you come on come on we'll read the rest of this later on but I like that The Virtuous person not only knows what the good thing to do is but he or she also is emotionally attached to that and when you're emotionally attached to something ain't it much better don't you get a lot more out of something if you're emotionally attached to it them people them ball games they are emotionally attached to what they do and you know what they get what out of it what they think now most of them get a big headache at the next day but we get God The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ so virtue does mean power it means strength but it also means that if you live a virgin life you have power and you have strength and even if you like Ruth husband's dead even Naomi says uh honey if you'll wait long enough I'll try to find a husband and I'll try to have a kid so I can have a son cuz you know that was the right of of passage was if if um say if I died in the old times my brother would have to take my wife and go into her to have a son and then they would name it after this after me to keep the lineage going everybody knows that in the Bible that you're looking at me like I'm strange but it's not it's true right but what happened was is God made sure she had to go to Boaz there was nothing left remember because if if if if what was it Chon and maon want Ruth and and orpa if Ora's husband had a live she'd had to went in with him to have a kid God made sure this story goes right it don't matter what he took all of them out of the way he killed them old people all all them old demons that we got and he made us turn and look in Boaz field cuz we had no other hope we had no other help sure there was one more Ken but he didn't want nothing to do with us poor old devil but there was one Ruth said man and when Boaz saw Ruth he knew she was a virtuous woman by what she had done just in the small amount of time she hadd been in the city same way with you brothers and sisters I want the world to see you're different not a different Doctrine without opening our mouth we should have a
