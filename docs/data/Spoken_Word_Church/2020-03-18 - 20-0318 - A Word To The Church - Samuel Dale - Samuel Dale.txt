========================================

[Music] I shining in our and how about it [Music] do you believe you love it [Music] amen and amen and amen and I want to see him don't you there just nobody in the house of the Lord good to be here in the middle of the week so let's just get right on the end to our thought tonight of what I want to try to present just a little something the church for us to think on and then move on from there if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Isaiah 59 and we'll read from verse on 19 and 21 okay just pray one for another two Lord we bless and lead in all things we're in a horrible day and horrible time but God is still the same so that's what we should be thinking about those times amen whether we thank you for or not and the time that we can gather together and we ask you now to just bless each one and just forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness help us to walk in you let your love in your grace be Lord sufficient for everything and we know it is got each one remember the sick among us Lord they were brother dick to our Lord and just deliver him out of that and he was sister Gail they're in the hospital room having to stay with him all the time Lord and we just pray that you would be with them and give her strength encouraging you and just bless and remember for the isle and sister Anna Lord and for brother Colley then all he's doing good and getting good reports sometimes so we would praise you and thank you have your way now and guide us as we read your word you come on the scene and just take control in Jesus name Amen so we'll go to verse 19 this is a kind of a background I'm just using it as a an insert to pick up the point from the scripture that we were using but really what it is it's a telling of the things and and all like that and it's bragging about Israel in the natural which is Israel in the spiritual the you and I and all and it's coming down to and saves like says this so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion now if you'll go to Romans 11:26 you'll see that it says the Redeemer comes out as iron the outer zone which is the bride here is to Zion which is coming to our way and bringing it toward the bride you know and it says they shall come to Zion and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob says the Lord as for me this is my covenant with them says the Lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed look at that promise says the Lord from henceforth and forever you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word the thank everybody for praying for us without her shoulder they got me free and and turned me loose yesterday and said I could go back to working and only problem was I forgot to ask him he didn't say I could work but that's nanny shaking her head but I wound up putting the barbed wire fence up and doing that yesterday after coming back from the doctor getting free so you know I must be wiggling pretty good and doing all right I still got some tingling but thank God for the whole thing we just appreciate you alright thank you now what we want to do tonight I want to just kind of make this a little instructive message and to make it to me I'm trying to make it to the time element right now all right now we know that we're in a drastic time around the world all right everything's falling apart looks like it's all just going you know and you know the sicknesses and the things that are there and the way that you look at it you think about it something must be going wrong somewhere Iraq so we're I believe we're in the right place now that's my whole point if we don't get nothing for deny get that point I was asked a question the other day kind of you know was my thoughts and what was I thinking you know in in respect of the message and I said I've always been positive I've always felt on that side and I said that's where I am now positive I told my wife on the way up to church today really I don't mean rejoicing because of the bad things don't misunderstand me in our minds don't don't think it I'm trying to say well no I'm not glad for sicknesses I'm not glad for bad economy I'm not bad I'm glad for all of this but we ought to be glad that we know that we've stirred up at least the devil enough to make him want to come down after but now he's not coming after just us he's coming after everybody Darcy can to me I don't believe this is the end of all things in another month or whatever I'm not it may be and if it is praise God all right that's all right there's no problem but we've always been in that basis but uh but I know and I do believe I do believe honestly this is the beginning of the end this is the part that's going to take us on all the way to you know to where we can get out of here and we should rejoice not as I said now don't think I'm saying rejoice because we're bad things going wrong no rejoice because it we're here we're here they were to a point that's why I've always been positive about things and trying to keep it to you as positive you know of where we're at and what we're doing and all like that I've always tried to keep that before all right now and as I said just for a second I'm I'm we know that one day there's going to be a lot of trouble we're promised that in the Bible well are we looking for it as one one one time you know are we looking at it as coming on at different times in different stages I've never looked for it all to dismount up at one time and bound down and it end out in the week and we don't know if I'm wrong I'm wrong on that all right but I've always looked at it as things are gradually going to get worse and worse and worse all right and as it does then it's going to require you and me to be able to follow that day that we're living in follow the time we're at and look at what's taking place around the country was just thinking the other day about something we've listened to the tape and brother Brennan said look at all of this flourishing in the economy you know nothing and how the house is building houses building buildings and building stuff like that well I didn't know that was a sign of the end of the world but that was what he was putting it he was putting it into that basis of the upbeat of the economy well see you think the economy's in bad shape it is but they just made or will make the ruling that you can have zero financing you know what that's far lose some money you know what's gonna do gonna lose some money it's gonna because everybody's waiting on it gets bound when you owned by this they wind up trying to get it for ya all right but now listen to me I believe we're in the end of all things I believe the Bible's right when it says the end of all things has come upon us all right but that was that should not make us afraid we said as I said rejoice rejoice that we are the people that it has been chosen at the end is coming home that's something to me is to think he chose us for the life well you know you can think what you want to know you always say the best of lives you know I mean if I'm eating banana pudding I always try to push a little bit of the kind of juicy with the good bananas that are ripe I I kind of pushed that over in the bow and I'm gonna eat that last because I don't like green bananas I like good juicy dark-looking all right and see that they say rotten but that's all right but now you know I said I'm not a doomsday but I look at things straight do you realize of what has happened in the past two weeks three weeks that you've ever thought about this could be that away or would ever be that away now we always had our idea as I said no they can't do this what I was telling a wife any of my said why don't some of these people just raise up and say how you gonna do it my doors in time I'm gonna keep on running my business somebody is working and pulling some strength well if you don't understand my language that means ever who's in control is now coming into control that's the only thing that I've say to you about anything natural look at the way the world is happening this is all over the world this is not just the United States it's all over the world you say well we we don't know this we don't know that that's the point Oh what are you calling that word propaganda propaganda was used in World War two you know by Hitler them which means sets up a blind set up for this just to get it to where the people don't know what they're doing all right if you don't see that in the world today there's nothing wrong with you one day we got plenty of this the next day we ain't got nothing next day we're back to plenty again we don't know what to do because it's it's all in in to the doings and and and somebody's pulling the strings to make these things work but it's not no problem to me about who's pulling the string cord I know who's doing it it's the devil it's him in his ways he's trying to force his his entire thing upon us to bring us to the basis and our biggest problem is voluntarily doing it he is using it so sly until he's making us really volunteer our own selves to the point you know that we'll do what he says and that's where the danger is that watch the stages of all of the trying to get you to volunteer you know how that is you ought to know you get the phone call today and what does it say send me your telephone number if you don't send me your telephone number within five minutes from now it's gonna I mean your social security number if you don't send it five minutes from now I'm gonna pull into your car to do this that in the fear tactics trying to get you to volunteer what's the best thing to hang up the phone all right when I do I look at the phone I might hang up on some of y'all sometimes because I look at the phone and if it ain't got human numbers you know what I mean but yeah if it's got all these other kind of numbers don't hang it up well you know I'm sorry if I hang up on you but I may do that but not listen see it looking at the world of how it's doing my whole point so you think that what brother Dale's going to give us the downside no no I'm on I'm on the upside you may not understand me in that I know that I know I'm crazy I you know how to tell me but I'm in the upside it's always been that way with me since I come in this message and begin to see that profit and what he was talking about I've never had a downside of me in this message now that a lot of downside to me as human had a lot of problems but not in this message I look forward today by day I pray my prayer is when I'm coming to church here or anywhere that I'm going that prayer is God used that person to not just or today to speak to my heart I'm hungry Lord I'm thirsty for you just let them give me one word and I don't people go sale they'll say I went to a service and I didn't get a thing out of well I've never went to a service I didn't get something out of it because even if they just say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm happy I can agree with them on that the rest might be that I don't agree at all forget I agree to that point of doing that but you see it's not something to look or to the backside it's something to look to to what can be expected if the Bible is right and we just read it don't you believe it it's the enemy when he comes in when the enemy comes in like a flood God's already promised us that he's going to raise up a standard against these things it's not a time to be down and out of the time to be rejoicing because we were the last day people the end of all things has come upon us well but now keep that in mind like I said I you know the message I was gonna bring it's still related to what we've been talking about and to me I'm rejoiced and seeing that the day that we're living is here oh my heart cries to the things that are happening naturally those people around the world of human beings they're not just pieces of dog meat or something throat those are human beings you know they have little babies they love those little babies they're human beings and a bunch of dogs see anybody's a Christian order I would join their heart for others and to help them any way in the world we could and to see how we ought to be willing to because it's meant for you and I to be that way all right now when all of this be coming out to the basis of saying you know and the government as at this moment has not demanded you hear the news new so they're demanding that we do this know they're asking us they're not demanding us when you get a demand you know it when you get a demand somebody most standing on your door and he's gonna be telling you what he wants you to hear or what else you said well you know they can do that any minute now that's but they said brother dick was here he life about I believe was Nixon wouldn't it he said he's gonna declare martial law you know back in his time the guy sitting there with him said he will not do that he said well I'm the president I knew it easier but then people's got guns you know cuz under martial law you have no rule the law is the rule and the law can be whatever the state of Georgia decides you know whatever it is it's the law but you see we're not in that point of a demand we're in a point of asking to volunteer no I had made up my mind was talking about it and meditating what to do and you know and I had made up my mind to comply with the not the law but the request and that we was not going to have a services this coming Sunday I hadn't made up my mind of that and then you notice I didn't it was all put in there and you know and it may come to a time that we have to do on a volunteer but we're going to watch very carefully between the much of a volunteer or a demand they because under volunteer you you do have the right to volunteer about it under demand and it will come to that I wish I told my wife I said I wish I'd have died a long time ago you know I didn't give her those exact words but I said I'd have been happy to died a few years ago you know what I don't have to face all this stuff you know I'm serious I'm serious about it it's been nice but knowing that things are going to take place but let's let them do what they're doing is it any problem we're calling all services this coming Sunday you know we're not going we'll we'll get that and explain it but is there any problem to that no we're doing it because we're volunteering to do it what if the city you was living in or the place you lived around that they was trying to give you some rules about it and you say well they can't room out and then about that time everybody in the community you've got ones up with a disease you'd be tickled to death to try to get somebody on your side and somebody do you know the problems to try to get solved if they can if we could take off from from having services for a month there wouldn't be any problem with me for us to do that because we can do without it we could do without coming here the world is going to go to that system all your searches is setting it up and to make it to the basis that that we can operate and that's not hiding from the government when it comes to the time of that you'll be you'll be in hunted you'll be demand at that point but see what's wrong with say it okay we'll just take off the cup for services maybe that'll take care of it but see our problem is one time now I've been at this for almost 50 years trying to preach to get you to see and I said it in and I'll say it now if we called off Sunday services what are you gonna do well it'd be a good time for me to take the kids - oh you think yeah well yeah not exactly the if we're gonna count it to be a volunteer basis of what we do we'll at least how to be you know the volunteer and I intend to eventually preach on a little bit and and I had already - laid out the point of of asking you say well here listen to these two tapes Sunday one in the morning one evening the unveiling of God and then listen to the mighty guard unveiled and then we'll try to pick up a service and go on with that show and I still wish you would I want you to because we will eventually get to that - the unveiling of God and see what it made and then get to the mighty God unveiled and see what it gets - we will do that because I hadn't made those plans those thoughts and ideas and parts in my mind or that we would be able to do this and do that and you know but we wouldn't be just getting in the car and go riding down to the beach or going down to Walmart you think it ain't serious go right down to commerce we're down there today picking up something we had to for a little spray pump up thing and you can't find no place to go eat now this thing's more serious than we think I mean it's serious for somebody because you think of all the billions of dollars that you lose in every day and now you're saying it's gonna give everybody a thousand dollars of course they say what it is you got to figure out the income tax and we get to new income tax and you're showing you income tax if you spent so much then that takes so much out and you ain't gonna get to hold thousand dollars but that's alright what you see they're doing what they can to try to pull out a natural economy and blaming it on [Music] disease in another country you know and and I'm just reading in today's paper they had this lady in Gainesville that she went to three different doctors and each doctor was verifying that she had some things but not enough to qualify her to be tested for this and I can't even pronounce the drug I mean the dizzy see they finally taught it to her and said she was guilty she was tested it's positive well you know I don't my point how long is it been that we could have been positive I've been coughing for forty years I've had a coffin problem for 40 years I could count as being contagious I guess for a lot of things we see we we think oh now this is some kind of plague that Satan has thrown down I was talking about do it as far as I know brother L never did preach preach sermons about the plagues and the vials and things but he did tell about him you know in the message he spoke of them and that he would kind of preach on it later you know but by appointed he never come out and said this is it and this is that because what I was telling him that I think it's in the Book of Revelations it tells about a great catastrophe happening and it names like 10,000 people dying in this earthquake or something then you turn around today and reading the newspaper what would it in big old word just who's a kook and say that just Xiaomi [Music] 300,000 people but you don't want that two hundred thousand people what's not what the Bible was talking about the Bible was talking about that ten thousand because it made the point you understand what I mean the Bible's got the answer the Bible has got the point the Prophet told us things to look out for things of how that would come in and take over but we also know that the Bible tells you how it's going to come it's going to come in by what flattery brother Branham in the sealed book says they're waiting on Satan Superman and he says and they're getting him he were talking about the Pope of Rome at that time go read your book see we've been told these things we've known we've talked about it I've stood right here and told you almost fifty years ago and this man over here verifies it you can't come in this city of Lula and put a church without being okayed by the some church association that's already in the city they won't let you and he would insist it matter and he couldn't get it done he had to come under another church under another to be able to come back to do that we've not been blind I've tried to keep you from being this totally blind to see what we're doing on on the other hand are not warning you watch out for these things or if you'd have seen that that happened that time with me when that little black brother stayed over here in the woods and camped out for months and and went to church and everything would come here and he would come to the altar ever service and cry and plead for God to help him and to do things and just you know and apologize for the way his life that he couldn't Bay he couldn't do he was just so great but to show you what God will do I walked up to him one day and I said brother I said something's telling me that you're a government agent they were sent in here to check us out he never moved a muscle frown to smile or nothing he's just student looked at me you know what I told him and I didn't get in my head and holler and spray you know what told him I said do a good job that's it just tell the truth about us don't tell no lies on us just tell the truth about him I followed the man and where he went on down through in the Father in Georgia one day I may meet that man face to face that's no problem I'm just telling you God has told us personally besides what the prophet has told us what to do and what to look for it's not something to come on you know screaming hollering to tell him we ought to be rejoicing that God has thought enough of us to come among us to tell us things to warn us in the future tell us to watch these things what do you say what watch Russia what's Russia well I wish you'd tell me this and I hadn't done everything now I don't check everything I want to read a little bit of the paper tonight but how come Russia's not being said very much about it in this situation you answer that one they haven't been in the paper every day Putin hollering and screaming about this and that and the other in telling us what's going on and the diseases they just been quiet you see Church we could be within this days of bringing all of these things to an end but we could be within years of it that's why we must not tie down to a point and holler and scream and say this is what it is and we're gonna do it different way now then you gonna do it see cuz I thought if I go to the church tell them that we're gonna cancel next Sunday services well I'm just gonna say oh you chicken-hearted coward why don't you stand up for what you believe and come right on and preach it that's what I'm doing exactly what I'm doing it's preaching it you call it chicken harder you tone or whatever we should never in any way have any thoughts in our mind about those four old people of the world today that are dying from all of these diseases need nothing we can do about it but we could pray for them as well as we pray for others just remember one thing because your Christian doesn't make you immune to sickness no matter of fact it opens it up the matter of fact it makes it worse many are the afflictions of the righteous with the Lord lead us out of them all what do you expect it to be you expected to me that no but I know another party goes with it we can pray talking to sister the other day I said we got one option she says what I said one option I said we pray pray for those four old people that are dying from these things brother Prakash invited me come and kept on trying to get me to come and see the brother I couldn't stand it he said well I know you and I know you couldn't I couldn't stand to see all that death and dying on the streets and babies born on the streets and dying on the streets I couldn't I couldn't take it what a little bit I've seen in the world it's been bad enough but listen we should be happy about these things and see it is like I said it and my plans was what's to do it what's traditionally okay you can think what you want to about me - we're gonna comply with the government we're not going to to buckle down to government we're going one week at a time or one day at a time when they come and tell me that I can't preach the truth you'll hear it it may be the last one but you hear it that's why I'm saying this hasn't turned out to be a religious situation yet it's a natural situation but if to me it's exactly like all the others it's to see what you can do with the people of the world to me that's what they're doing there's being how where you'll stand for what you believe or not but listen I was planning on this canceling the service for the weekend but I began to think about it that's all right we can get around outlines and still it doesn't bother me as far as what I'm saying now listen to what I'm saying all right we will not have a Sunday service in this building Sunday now I said a service I didn't say we wouldn't be here preaching and send it out because that's one option that we still have so you may have to listen to internet for a week or two because she church this may be the fact not a just the end of the world but it may be the fact and all of these things the government's doing the best they can do and if somebody ain't doing if you tell me what's going on when they can just close out a whole government like clothes they've closed everything down look at the millions of billions of dollars that's being lost every day look at just these sports events that they've had to cancel because they afraid it'll get started will you realize we may have a hundred people in America with a disease but if that's good starting it can spread all over you said well you don't talk like a Christian I'm talking like what I think a Christian really is a Christian should be one that would be concerned about everybody in the world to be praying and thinking about these things three that's a Christian you know what I get I can holler oh the devil doing it now boy that that that Antichrist is coming down and takes you to see them riding here can't you see them riding there you don't even know what the antichrist is but listen well what we're gonna plan to do is plan to just have the minister being here and type the service put it on internet they'll be up to you to listen and it is mandatory that I'll make it disappear eight right on all things all who come in helping the services we'll do it on a volunteer basis if you don't want to volunteer to come and help us do what little bit we have to do here to get it out because they're even saying now that they're gonna start riding by churches and places and take it down how many cars are they can do that really easy they can do all kind of things so we just try our best to just float with them go with them as what we can do let's see what if the Bible says now you may differ with McCarter's in the Beatitudes but it does how does that state that come on and flipped in my mind it's talking about in the Beatitudes you know be your attitude but then it automatic said all that wants to push it a little uncertain that says agree with your adversary quickly right unless he take you to the law and you not be able to come out well is that God telling you to agree with your adversary to the point of your adversary senator Trinity so we've got to agree with the law if that is the Trinity we saved the Trinity now come on I'm gonna take a few minutes to say something I'll remember what Martin Luther said he said we'll do everything we can we'll we'll do everything we will not in any way harm or try to stop this or anything but let me ask you a question that was natural things he was doing because of a natural disaster that was going on in his land did he go that day and preach against the Catholic Church I'd say he did wouldn't you wouldn't you think he went on over and preached against the Catholic Chur that furry day that he was uh power standing up for people and declaring that he was going to try to help them and do the best that he could do because he's human we're not giving in to the devil we just used him what's wrong with using him you gave us the Internet we're sending that we can touch the world with these messages the world now around the world has heard the Word of God listen you realize that brother Branham the Smashing it's being on the Internet the world has heard that message what a glorious day what a glorious time when I asked her brother I said you think your dad ever thought that his message would go around the world on a little bit ik player that you could plug up out in their jungles and get a solar power and brother branham kinases could go for it all the world he said I don't know do you think about it this message has went around the world what if the Bible say about paraphrasing but what if there's some about when it gets to that point that it's reach the world then I'm in a few days I'm gonna be 80 years old I'm gonna having this juice for coffee you know I hope innate to call fen wrong way to spell that word but I'm just serious about a church are we facing these things in the right order to see what we would do or where we're at we're not guaranteed that disease is denied it's not a great thing put over us now wait a minute you said I quote run around and will quote like what we use so go ahead now so you're running the ground do it both ways we do have a covering over us that keeps us safe in the time of sickness so don't misunderstand my words are saying it but you know at the same time we can be sick the same Lord Jesus that was the god of the healer you know he was the healer himself who's sick think get it right he put it in the right order we put it in our to be happy about it and get it to where we can look down and see hey we're to end we're to end of this name if it's another 20 years what a lot it's another hundred years all right so what sister pleat I'm now gonna be getting pretty old what the town whatever yeah we'll make it we made it so far I thank God every day for my help [Music] talking they came in there I said and the nurse basically to the nurses over here doing the shoulder and Hassan I said do you realize and I'm nearly 80 years old and I said I've had one operation now had gum surgery you don't have to be cut and pull the tooth out or sort of I'm not about something they could hand out right there I've never been offered never had no broken bones never hadn't it you think I don't value God in his healing but I like what brother John Martin said about it one time he said we don't have to wait do we get sick to pray you know I've pretty well the way we are right well pray for me I'm sick well why didn't you pray yesterday for you got sick there's no one another day no your silly not sadly but it's true I don't have to wait I get thank you for healing me and me not even sick well I ain't none eating me praying like that away well let's go ahead you don't understand what I'm talking about I'm talking about it all knowing God that he's taking care of his bride covering his bride with a blood but at the same time we're human beings that have sicknesses and heartaches and troubles no because we're human beings uh-huh do you see what we're gonna do we're just gonna switch things around a little black and we'll have Sunday services you can be able to view it at home on your internet and to you that don't have the internet we will copy the services back you're on the other the mp3 or in what you call it part of it and you can listen to the services we're not going nobody's going to be cut out it will be left for everybody what's that way we can be saying if the government comes along say look what hey what you we're doing what you say then when they say you can't do that we may have to argue with them that's all right so just remember the internet service will be doing that waiting and I'll take probably the morning service way to take the evening service will have the the Internet services and it'll be just like you're sitting here thank God for the ability we have the ability to bypass all of these things Satan and all these smartness he just messed up and putting it in wrong hands now we can do what we need to do with it and do it Church do you understand what I'm talking about see I'm trying to get you to see that this is a worldwide event this is this not a whole county situation and a worldwide event of sickness all over the world of one thing sure we know that we've had those diseases in time but it's like I was trying to tell you not about the swine flu of what Obama's day but dwelling back they had a time back Thursday loss I forgot how many millions and millions of people in one thing are in we're brother Quinn comes from they they died from a potato blight and just died all over well you compare a hundred years ago and if you lost a hundred million people but you compare that with today when you only had maybe one billion back then now you have seven to ten billion people if you lost a billion people to one of these desert and German yeah that wouldn't even be a hardhead dropping the bucket me and see this is the odd thing to me that it stood it's it's not just one cup place it's all over it's all over the world it's gaining well it's either one or two things something man-made has brought these things to pass or it is some of the flags and things of the Bible that are speaking of either way it's the same situation the same the end to it we don't throw up her hands and quit I didn't come into this to quit they didn't scare me when they said well we're gonna do the code it just kept coming more and more and more that didn't scare me this for them to say that we want you to do this Nana knowing that eventually they can demand you sold nowhere in America hey I got a bunch of stock and Brooklyn Bridge I want to sell it are you dumb enough to buy it you say what do you mean that's what I mean by our dumbness don't think we're in America don't think we're in America protected by American laws we have no American laws the law ain't gonna help you it's gonna help the one that tells what to do and they can take that and use it I I do believe this is the beginning of the final end of pushing how long he's got to do it we'll be here hundred years if I live that long I pray God I still had enough force if I can live to be that old without having a voice to still scream out and say Jesus Christ is here living in the hearts of the people getting us ready to get out of this situation and that he will bring us through why because he promised it I'd rather have God's promises than everything else you can give me just give me his promises he promised it promised us all of these things I don't consider this to be the end of the world it could be I repeat I will try my best to help do anything I can to try to help anything if somebody come in this building sick I would do the best I could to help those people I made myself clear back yonder or said it but it was too clear I guess and I I won't just make that statement right now what I'm doing I've left it back under years ago and made a statement I said if you're sick come on the church well you know kind of got mixed up a little bit the code I never meant if you got 105 degree temperature come to church but I do say it like this if you've got a 110 degree temperature call us up I'll meet you anywhere in any of this building or whatever and I'll go pray with you about that child or a person or whatever I would not back down from that because there's some sickness to think it would be upon me no because I want to help you you have a sickness call us let us know and say I'm on the way to church told him our home one time and we was taking the kids to I think it was a time Wade we cured him with the doctor I'm not certain but anyhow we wound up and I said where you going I said well we're going to church and pray and then we're going to the doctor that's what life is well if you're going to pray why are you going to call them sick is any problem you know is anything wrong with the fact that you've been sick and a half's for the doctor to help you you might wind up like we did with wait one time when acuity man had bad tonsil things and it was just old man and he'd run 105 degrees and brother Tatum unless we took him to the doctor called him that was in days that the doctored meets his office you know and their old doctor come in and about the time he opened he opened the door for us to walk in here comes Wade and he was at that high temperature and he just plastered that whole building inside vomiting you know what the doctors say he's taking back home he'll be all right now and just like a doctor at least let us do something you know or let us pay for for all that he said I've got a cleaner for that yeah what you see we think a lot of times sicknesses you know you thought you listen to brother Brown and when he said said look at that job he said yeah that old Damon said he's getting it out of there what you see we look at things in in the wrong direction and and that's what I'm saying and trying to get us there not do in this is to not look at it in the wrong direction to think hey the end is here and what do we do I'm scared I'm scared we'll get it out rid of that get rid of the fear that's the point of preaching reason instead of this board over and telling if I'm preaching through one thing what when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard so let's believe in him and keep calling upon him to help us and goddess why can't we can you be happy when you're sick I just got out of there we'd left the Baptist Church and I had a real bad sickness and the brother used to go to church our Withers he he come to see me and we got sitting there talking and I mean then I was I said wait a little bit I got talking and I got out of that you know and I got to talking to him about the Lord and all he said I thought you see well see I got on the different side I got over on the side of the healer and I was being happy about it he didn't matter how much I had to say I sick I'm glad to talk to him about the Lord do you understand what I'm trying to get it we should be happy instead of anything to think about being down and out but as I said one ago who do we do now what are you gonna do we're gonna have maybe Sunday you have an opportunity what are you gonna do so you're gonna prove what you are oh brother Dale don't talk like that we're gonna prove what we are well let's see what takes place you get an opportunity to not have to come to church you're signed out everything's okay you'll not be doctored and all but what we do with the rest is gonna prove a lot of things see I want to do everything I I would go right now that would be no problem with me and you know me well enough know if I say it I mean it I'd go to these countries right now it wouldn't be bothering me whatsoever to just leave and go if I could help them I knew I could do something to help them because that's poor old human beings they pray that God will will remove these things whatever it is he'll get it over with and he'll finish it up or whatever the plague is or whatever the thing if he's browning or if it's the devil to bringing it whatever dish what pray that God will get it all worked out and and get it into the right order and we'll be praying for other people you mean you preferably what's the problem what's the trouble why can't you pray for somebody else you mean you wouldn't pray for the Pope of Rome I prize me on this quick as I would anybody else because he's a human being that's where we've got the idea we I say we've the message people's got the idea that we are a special set aside group and none of these things is supposed to be bothering us hey many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord lead us out of them all we sat down lazily and just accept what he's doing hey I'm fighting I don't go down like I said I went to the doctor there Nate the operate on my shoulder you know come out and give me a good clean bill of health out of everything and say what they had done well I didn't go home and lay down I got laid long enough I was tired I was tired from laying I'd get up late on I go to bed I get up in lay down but I thank God I took one pain pill I didn't need it I didn't need it never took them all you said would you hurt a little bit that's the core than what you called a little bit because yesterday afternoon I just is so tired to do and I said mama waited Benny what it took us and we hadn't been to the bank you know under doing the thing that I said let's go to buy new some bank and get out I didn't intend to go walking through Walmart because that's my point of what I'm saying we say oh we're sitting you know we're this way we're going to Walmart well no no you might go to Walmart and get what you want and it might not be in a bag but I told her I said let's go she said you want to get out of here so when I got back I got a change I had to sneak around a little bit cuz she's sitting in the window watch it try sneak out and I get my flourish and we're putting some barbed wire on the inside of a wooden fence and they go strong bla bla I gotta work with that with my wire up it went a little high here come the other floor what are you doing over here I'm working that's just me I can't lay down and I certainly ain't gonna lay down in the gospel I'm gonna stand in the fight for everything Oh God that's what we all should do praise God for what He has given us do you thank him for the word that you've heard I do every day I walk through the house and lord thank you you could reveal this to somebody apples you could reveal this to somebody else they could be and I do yeah I'm beginning to reveal it to somebody I don't into my eyes me either I want him to open that word to her that I can see and what am I going to see when I opened the word the prophet said when the bride realizes what she's here for I'm paraphrasing it you know he said she'll be an invincible army you said well we're not an investment well then we're not doing that correctly we're not facing it with an attitude of hey not that I'm sick help me I'm sick ain't nothing wrong being sick now when you sick you're sick but now when you make yourself sick you know yourself you call me up anytime you want to what does it say it how you doing brother day off wonderful I'm dying I'm laying you're hurting like everything I'm feeling wonderful because I'm in Christ Jesus I've got an opportunity to see God move in mysterious ways and to see things take place what would not be happy you understand I hope you get what I'm talking about I hope you understand the things that I've tried to bring to say and not trying to do to say anybody else it's not here tonight you know they didn't believe I ain't saying that it takes one thing about it he's about 60 in here that came when I told no one that we wouldn't go on how service isn't or nothing I didn't talk to nobody about it but nobody didn't call me and say we're going out services you came okay let's take that and go on we can't we came to let people know where we stand not it we're so mean and arrogant about this nothing no no we're trying our best to help others too but to be a human being and viraat is our joy call musician it's our joy our thoughts or ideas or ways to be a Christian and to just let him take care of things let him guide us through these times he will he failed us yet like I told you about the the man that I believe God told me to tell that man said the government your government man well my lord he he was a whole lot more of a Christian action of a man than I'd ever thought about in my life but I believe God told me I told you that they got in this door right here but I said you don't wanna I'm not gonna look around I ain't searching over the building for bugs I said I want him to find I want him to be here I want him to hear the gospel wouldn't it be something with a crazy bunch of nuts like we are and you was having to sit down and listen hour after hour every day to services and try to pick out some kind of way I do while I just quit my job I'd be the best way to say it go ahead it'd be crazy let's see he's God and he'll never change so let's serve him that away he's always been that way to always come on the scene when we asked for him he's always gotta just let Stan
