and turn over to Romans chapter 8 well God is good at the two of us they need to be able to come together and worship again try not to get too leaky up here I just speak to you tonight on a little something I've just been meditating on the last week or so and just kind of wanted to share some things with you but we're gonna look at Romans chapter 8 I know a lot of the ministers here oo Romans chapter 8 there's some things in that chapter so I just want to speak some things to encourage you and build your faith up a little bit but before we go into the scripture let's just go to the Lord in prayer little God we know Lord as we look out upon the things that are taking place in the earth and this is an hour of confusion Lord and and you said that there would be come upon the earth of famine in the land for the hearing of the word and all these different scriptures that we read about how people would be confused all the way from the beginning from the book of Genesis how they build a Tower of Babel the tower of confusion and that would go on through the Scriptures all the way to the end time where people would be so confused and not know which way to turn lord I pray tonight Lord it's you unlock the door about confusion Lord that we might be able to have have an idea of what we're doing here and Lord that you might be able to build up our faith Lord well we won't just be looking around with blinded eyes Lord but our eyes will be open to the promises of God and then what we're doing here and what's what's got to take place in our lives so that we can take an exit granted I pray Lord that tonight will not be just a vain gathering Lord but should you leave let us leave here tonight Lord with our faith built up Lord within us Lord Jesus knowing who we are and no one the day that we're living in Lord Jesus there will not be it will not be filled with doubt Lord in despair Lord of God but filled up knowing Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever we asked Lord Jesus that you'll just feel welcome here tonight Lord that your spirit will come and quicken your word Lord to us lord help us Lord Jesus that you'll be with us tonight we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right Romans chapter 8 verse 15 and 18 I'm just going to speak really on you know the theme of adoption runs all the way through this chapter but I really just wanted to focus tonight on the the spirit of adoption and what that is and kind of motivates you a little bit and it says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also klore glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the world so you know that the denominational world I just kind of was looking at the different things in different churches today talk about adoption and everything and they've got they that you know they've got their ideas and things and the the thank God for a prophet because in this day in this hour we can understand the way that they're you know a lot of times when you look in Scripture it's very confusion I was talking to somebody the other day and they said you know the Bible is very it's not very difficult to understand at all and I disagree with that it is difficult to understand if you don't have the Holy Ghost you cannot understand the scripture you know that when you look it over to the book of Revelation and it talks about all these things the trumpets and the vials and all the seven seals seven church churches what I have to do with me what all these different things that in the book of Revelation and not to mention the things that Paul talked about at the Hebrews and things that even Peter said Paul says many things that are hard to be understood and and so you've got to look with a when when when when the Word of God when the Spirit of God begins to open up these difficult things you can look at it with a kind of a different I believe than the way that the domination of world has taught adoption the way they look at it is that we've been adopted from out in the world and and God kind of looks as a here let me still slow down here a minute yeah it's like a little child maybe you go out to Russia or somewhere and find you a child and you bring them in and and and bring them into your home and and you adopt them and you you put them into your family which is true that's what God does to us he brings us from out in the world and he places us into the into the family of God but you see that's not the end of the story and I think well that's maybe we're looking out into the the way the different churches and things today to teach that is that they they kind of stop right there and that is not the new birth coming into the family of God and all those things is not the end of the story that's there's much more to it than that and so if you look at in the book of Romans Romans actually takes Romans chapter eight takes you down through that process of adoption the three stages and it starts off with the spirit of adoption and so maybe let's just kind of set that set the stage here what what are we trying to get to and if we go back to the book of Genesis with Adam the Son of God was there in the Garden of Eden and the Bible doesn't tell many details about it it's talks about how God came in the cool of the evening and walked with him and all those things and it talks about how that that he was able to name all the different animals and according you know according to their attribute this was a sheep cause it bares wool this is a this is a crow because it the attributes of the thing all the different things of that animal he was able to speak and call it what it was and by the by the message of the Prophet we understand that Adam I had it was his flew from so open up that he he was a conduit that God could walk talk through he knew he knew his purpose there he knew what God wanted him to do and he could speak to the wind if it got if it got too rainy or whatever and just say I win moved back and he was God was so he was so yielded to God that God could just use him in whatever channel he wanted him to be you know that is what God Jesus Christ came to die to take us back to not just so that we could come to church and be in like a club or a large or something but so that God we could become vessels of a Living God that he could come and live in us and use us in whatever way he sees fit if he wants to use us like Joe did to make a little story with our suffering and all those things so that others can see as an example and that's the way that our lives will be used I want my life to be program said if whatever way he wants me to use me that's the way that I want to be used if God wants to use up using me for just like brother Brent said one time he might use raise up a minister just to preached one sermon and if that's all that God wants me to do then then let it be you see our purpose in life is to be used by God in whatever way he sees fit and if you can find the plan and purpose for your life and get into that position get it where God wants you to be then you're then you're getting somewhere but I'm sitting and who is God he said then we and fellowship what Adam lost in the fall Christ restored in his death do you believe that to bring man back into fellowship with God now the church has moved up to that fellowship with God communion like Adam had at the beginning in the Garden of Eden taken away to all sin away free from condemnation holy spirit cleansing us from all sin now you're free to exercise the next step in God see now now I wonder how many may be tonight sitting here realize that there's a next step do you know that that next step was kind of prophesied in the life of Jacob when he laid there on that he's laid his head on that rock in the Old Testament and and he looked up and he and he saw a ladder coming a lot of heaven and he saw angels coming down I sin descending and ascending going up and down on that ladder in his head was on that rug do you know that typifies something that typifies a journey that you've got to make a journey of character building a journey of God building you up so that he can he can trust you putting you into a place where you know what you're not talked about wondering what's true and what's not living in the state of confusion wondering what you know you talk to people today and it seems like it's like talking to a man that's in prison and you want to help them so bad I believe that's what that's where it really drives the ministers and the gospel that the ministers are there they're preaching the people that are in prison trying to get them out and the people that are in prison are many times can't don't realize that they're in prison if we if they could just realize that that the gospel holds the key and open up the door then they can be free you gotta take that next step the whole I remember I preached a sermon years ago about how everything starts with a step you gotta take that first step like Peter did out of the boat you got to take a step you got to take your first step toward justification and then another step towards sanctification take another step toward the baptism the Holy Ghost and then when you're adopted into the family of God there's more to it there's more to it but you see that being adopted into the family God I believe now this is maybe maybe my own personal conviction this is the most important step because how are the seals gonna be open to you if you're not born again how are you gonna go up the statutes perfect man if you're not born again how can you how can you understand any of these things if you're not born again you must be born again first of all and then everything else brother Graham said these vertices will be added automatically and I hope I'm not getting too deep or anything but but all everything will take care of itself will say that if you'll just get born again because if you get born again your appetite will change you will lose your appetite for the world and you'll start hungry for the things of God you'll begin to realize over time what the real what you're really coming to church for that you're not coming to church so much for the music and things but you're coming to church to feed your soul to feed it with the Word of God you're not coming to church just to feel an anointing on your flesh or on your spirit but you're coming to church to exchange that soul on the inside of you that they receive that little divine spark of God out on the inside you see you can see this journey all the way through the scripture remember David King David what God told David I took you from out of the sheep coat in other words I adopted you I took you out of the sheep coat and I made you a king he took him from the sheep coat and made him a king and along that journey that was three-stage do you know he was anointed three times he was anointed when Samuel anointed him he was anointed by the tribe of Judah and then again by the tribe of Israel so you can see that process that you and I have to take the same process that Jesus Christ himself took all the way through the scripture you can see that in the end the story of Abraham that brother Wade's been preaching on you can see it on this is the story of Ruth you can see it in all these types and shadows and I believe see that's why the new birth is so important because when you are born again you read the Bible with a new understanding you begin to look at all these stories and you recognize that God is doing something in your life the same way that he did in these believers and you're looking at the steps that they walk in you recognize you begin to identify yourself in the word because you see yourself in the word there you're walking that same journey you're going down that same trail you come into a place just like Abraham did where God says go up and sacrifice your son and trial and the test to see what your reaction will be and you've got to come to a place where God can have trust in you and confidence in you enough to give you the car keys enough to give you that same kind of responsibility that Adam had enough to give you the opening of the seven seals we said well how can i I don't understand the seven seals I don't understand these great mysteries and things what does God have confidence in you to know what to do with the word there's God have confidence in you now to look at you and see the reaction that you've had to the word so far does he look at you and see what you've done with the word have you have you actually received it and doesn't like the brands and go back and study the word to see whether the scriptures and things that you've been taught or true or have you said oh have you discarded it and said no I don't have time for that I've got time for my soap operas than the Hollywood and all that stuff but I don't have time to get into the world of God you see when you get into the word of God it will actually transform your mind it will change you it will emit will birth the Word of God into your life changing you from the inside out you've got to be born again brother Branham talked about when you go down to the water and you get baptized and we believe in scriptural baptism not in the names of titles within the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because the name of the Father in the name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost here's the Lord Jesus Christ those are just titles if you will go to the bank and say well cash I need to catch this cheque and they said father on it that you would you wouldn't even catch that you would they would want to know what was the night what person is it and so that's why we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham told us that when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you come up then you are a candidate for the Holy Ghost you're a candidate and I want to I want to say tonight that you are a candidate you're a candidate to receive that first stage of adoption the new birth you're a candidate and all along that journey you are a candidate to receive that next stage you're a candidate because in Acts chapter chapter 2 verse 39 cents for the promises under you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call it means that tonight if you don't have the new birth you were an a candidate to it if you'll just receive it and that's why I want a major tonight on the spirit of adoption because if you begin to think in your mind just maybe years ago as you thought well how can I receive the new birth it's too much for me maybe now you're born again but you begin to think in your mind how can I receive adoption it's too much for me how can i how can the seals be opened up to me it's too much for me but tonight if you can open up your heart and receive the word you are a candidate for adoption the adoption is ready for you now is throughout the hour of adoption now is the time of adoption it is abduction time it's time for the sons of God to be made manifest it's time for the sons of God to step on on the scene and reveal themselves because now is the time if God called you you were a candidate for adoption you know that first little stage of adoption and I'm talking about the new birth and it's a it's a special consecrated time you know you think of it almost like a and the natural little baby being born in the delivery room coming forth and there's not a lot of joking around in the delivery room there's not a lot of laughing and things because it's a somber time it's a time maybe I'm crying of mournful in every morning and all of those kind of things there's something something taking place brother I never taught us that that you can actually feel that presence of that little soul that life coming into that baby and the atmosphere of the room changed as life is coming into that child something is taking place and I believe that's what's taking place in a church that we don't come to church just to get the ground wet but we come to church to plant a seed we come to church there's a somber atmosphere something place where life is coming forth coming out of that ground like a little Lily out of the mud something is taking place and you know when you plant a seed that seed goes into the ground and it will it will produce something we don't come to church just to just to get our water and pot out and sprinkle the ground a little bit and rejoice because we have a blessing of spiritual blessing we're coming to church to birth sons and daughters of God we're coming to church to a to see the manifestation of adopted sons to see the eyes of people being opened up that's why that's why we don't laugh and joke around in church that's why the pulpit is no place for laughing and marketing things because there's a birth taking place there's a birth of the happening but they're the birth of adopted sons of God adopted sons and daughters something that's taking place and your eyes do you realize that is the evidence of the new birth to you is when your eyes come open then we believe at this church that that you go through three stages first you hear about the gospel and then God cleans you out and then he puts himself inside of you and when he puts it himself inside of you and when he gives you the new birth then you could see the gospel for what it really is that's why you must be born again but we believe that that you don't get the new birth just when you believe because Paul said in Acts chapter 19 he how they told that the Ephesian Church when when Apollo's was at Corinth and equal came to the Ephesian Church he said have you received a new birth since she believed in other words that the process is you've got to go through the gift of new birth and when God gives you the new birth it opens up your eyes Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 18 says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him and the knowledge of him in other words you become to be less confused your eyes are open and you know people people seem to not have a big problem with that when they when you're talking about water baptism or one God or the fact that there's no eternal hell because well how could there be an eternal hell if the only thing this eternal is God and if your inhale then that that dead this logically cannot be God is the only only only thing that is eternal but my point is that people have no problem with these little basic things as you're becoming a new Christian as you're entering that first stage of adoption they have no problem with the new birth being understanding at that level but then when you begin to talk about the deeper things who is this Melchizedek three pools the seven seals the seven thunders the threefold ministry the book of Revelation in the book of Hebrews then we draw back and say why don't we need to understand these things if the new birth is the understanding that what will adoption be that's a new understand and what do you have to do when you come to adoption you don't lay aside your understanding but you've got to keep moving on up you've got to climb that ladder you don't stop understanding the new birth is understanding an adoption will be understanding but it'll be more of it I don't mean to yell at you but maybe that'll help you stay away brother Brown said you knows what confuses everybody's because what brother Brown said in Satan's Eden he says we don't have to understand it we believe it because God said it so and that settles it forever the whole thing that's the way to believe it and listen when you're starting out of the new Christian you don't understand it how can you understand it you just believe you say I believe it I don't I don't understand why acts 2:38 he says to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but I'm moving on with a Lord helped me that you'll open up my eyes of understanding you start off believing and then then when you do believe God will give you understanding and that will give you the real kind of believing that you really need how can you really believe if you don't understand it but when you really do understand then you know you've got something and I want to say to you tonight that if you've got that spirit of adoption if the spirit of adoption is teaching you you will understand if you have that if you have that eagle nature living on the inside of you you will understand because an eagle will understand you will understand that if you want to know what the seven seals are and the three pools and all these things get that spirit of adoption in and open up by the opening of the word get the pile that word on the inside and he will teach it to you instruct it to you you will understand yeah we were talking recently about the seals and just kind of talking about can you can you take a body change without understanding the seals can't can you do it and I want to say I want to just kind of flip that statement around if you're going to take a body change you will understand the seals you will understand because you're an eagle and God has predestinated you to understanding he has given you he is a but you in this out with everything that you need he sent a prophet messenger in this day to open the cap of all the hidden mysteries that nobody could understand before what the seven churches were what the seven trumpets were what the seventh seal of the seven thunders all these things have been opened up so that you will be equipped to come to adoption to come to a place where your character has been molded to the image of Jesus Christ what God can look at you and say I trust him because he's just like I am brother but I'm saying it is the rising of the Sun he said let me straight a little scripture here for you I think we're off the phone but we are still here he that heareth my word of the believeth on him that sent me has that for everlasting life John 5:24 now look I'd go down the street and just take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding not making us say nothing else but just saying what it is see the right word there in the Greek and the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right I go down here and here's a drunk coming along the street and with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking God's name in vain and everything else like that say did you hear what that preacher said did you yeah yeah I heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life see see he that understand it's my word he that is an eagle do you understand how prevalent that that kind of thought process is we think that as long as we've got a the Bible playing in the background on a music channel or the gospel radio station but we have the tapes playing in the background or something that we can absorb it just by like osmosis or something but listen just because you stay say the statement I believe does not believe that you mean that you believe you've got to understand what you believe in you got to know it listen all of these things that I'm talking about here they're taking you up the statue of a perfect man taking you up into adoption into the capstone into that into that old core of the land that brother brother brother Dale has been preaching about all of those things are for your understanding brother Branham said in the Easter seal he said it's the Holy Spirit coming down to quicken make a lot of those people that's poor ordained of God to be in the rapture notice that is if he is a true he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle now the little Eagle probably in the barnyard was eating all right but he knowed it wasn't just exactly right but then when he heard the truth and he received this truth and then he goes on and you know a lot of times when you say these kind of things it can scare the young people it can make him to think well I've got to do something now I've got I've got to work harder and that's true you do have to you have to read your Bible you have to pray you've got you got to get serious with God and everything but the point the main kind of effect that I want to I want to communicate tonight is God has equipped you so don't be afraid God has not given you the spirit of fear but he's got giving you the spirit of a sound mind he's given you everything that you have need of he's given you the spirit of adoption do you know do you know why he started you off with the spirit of adoption because the spirit of adoption is gonna bring you to adoption to a place where God can trust you and brother when I'm said in the Easter seal just moving on down to paragraph 90 he said paragraph 92 but he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life and let me say that again in paragraph 93 when this spirit has found you the individual has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made you for you before the foundation of the world it is your potential like if you asked me for an oak tree and I give you an acorn now the life for the oak tree is in the Acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up in other words you put a seed in the ground and after a while it produces a great big tree does that sound like you put up you put a little corn of wheat in the ground and after a while you got another corn of wheat you plant a corn in the ground and don't know what kind of thing what kind of seed would grow a broad tree but after a while you've got a bride tree because it comes up and at the top of the tree you know all these different types and things that brother Ben talked about the top of the tree is the best fruit and then the top of the tree can see the light of the Rising Sun and all those kind of things because look we're following their same pattern that is repeated all down through scripture abraham and ruth and elisha and all the different things as they journey from from starting off something like like abraham saying just here in the voice of god speak to him and say turn and go with me and it leads up all the way until finally he's confronted with God in flesh walking to him and and you and I are not gonna see God in flesh let's just let I'm just gonna preach you and I are not gonna see God in flesh like walking up to you like Abraham did but you're gonna see God veiled in a bride you're gonna see God veiling himself in you and I come into a maturity God is not gonna the rapture is not going to come for a little baby church it's going to come for a mature church that has heard the word and become the word and that's why we need a prophet do you see because all of these denominational systems could produce born-again children but they couldn't give you all the opening of the word enough to take you to give you a body change to give you that leap of faith to overcome to jump over that wall of the troops to jump over the wall of death and get out of here but you see he's given us the spirit of adoption in Galatians chapter 4 verses 1 to 5 it says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all in other words when a little child is born he don't have Authority he doesn't have not he does not have access to the bank account there's no difference between the child and the servant that's working in the house but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father in other words he's being raised up right and I want to kind of share this little little comparison with you and just go ahead and leave that up you know any of you fathers here if you would look at your sons and just kind of think meditate within yourself would I allow my son or my daughter to have access to my bank account that would be a very scary proposition wouldn't and you could be destined to do that to open up your bank account to give your checkbook to your till you're a little uh your young son or or young daughter even even when they grow older sorry Zach but I'm afraid how it'd be a little bit scared worried about giving you access to my bank account and you know a lot of times parents will talk about these things and they'll say well you know they talk about their son they saved up all this money and then he went out and and bought something that seems so foolish or whatever because what they're looking at looking at it from a more mature perspective the father is looking at that and saying I don't trust my child if I were to open up my bank account to this child for them to make a wise decision and every aspect when my yeah there's a lot of danger there you come back in the bank account be drained I'm talking about in the natural now you look at it the next weekend and all of a sudden you've got all these overdraft fees and now you're in a real fix that would cause all kind of discord in your home let's see God God knows what he's doing he knows how to raise up children and he gives you a tutor to bring you to the place where he can trust you and knows and knows that if he gives you all of this all of this access to his bank account so to speak that you're not going to use it foolishly but for example if you had the same kind of access that Adam did to just to just move a mountain or move a tree or whatever what's to say that you wouldn't drop a tree on somebody's head because you get really mad with him you get really I maybe be a little bit comical or whatever but you see my point God is raising us up so that he can trust us and the tutor that he gives us is the Holy Ghost now that that story that brother branham uses is in the in the eastern in the east they would give a tutor they would assign a tutor to raise up that child so that when they came to a place where the tutor goes back and reports back and says where the child is he's acting just like you dad he's acting just like you then in that time a special ceremony of adoption the child would be taken to the side and robed and all of these kind of things would be done to it to kind of go through a ceremony that now I've got my trust in this child and you know you can think almost we listened to that story that we're talking about different people and that's in the type there's a tutor and there's a father but the father himself and the spiritual has come himself to teach you and instruct you in the way that you should go God Himself is living inside of you instructing you according to your word let me keep reading this even so when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons in other words he wants you to be adopted that you've heard many time of Angelus will come through and they'll say God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want it and all these kind of things and I think now is the time to evangelize a little bit higher God wants to adopt you more than you want it you begin to think that it's beyond you and all these kind of things but God wants to give you access to his bank account but you got to start off as a baby you know Paul when he began to instruct the Corinthians he said and I in 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 to 6 he said I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as under babe's in Christ I fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able for a year yet carnal for whereas there is among you envy and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men you begin to see kind of the the requirements for adoption the requirements are that you've got to have a a different kind of character you can't be pulling at churches and saying well we're better than them and envying among yourselves and and you know it's easy to say we should not be doing these kind of things we should not be doing that but you know the answer though the the vaccine that God has provided to get rid of all that that our bad behavior is the Word of God and you know we can beat one another and all those kind of things but the Word of God is what will actually change us and mold us into his image and he said for for wild one saith I am of Paul and another I am of apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is Apollo's but ministers by whom he believes even as the Lord gave to every man and Paul is speaking this way to the Corinthians he had to speak to them as a little babies because they they could not understand these deep things of God they could not dip their toe into the deeper waters because they were not quiet pressurized to that yet but when he spoke to the Ephesians he talked to them in a little bit different language he was able to speak to them in a way like in Ephesians chapter 4 where he said and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers why he explained to them why God put those gifts in the church that we're not just coming to church just for a show but we're coming to have our character perfected he said for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children and now let me pause right there that we were coming over and one of my kids at one of my younger kids I mean I don't mean to call you out but I'll just ask do you know what adoption is and they're like I don't know I don't know so I want to pause so that everybody kind of has a baseline what is adoption adoption is when God sees that you are a mature Christian and you match up with his word you start off with a baby and you grow up like an acorn to a tree like Abraham - looking at the son of man you start up so he's saying that we his forth be no more children because God doesn't want us to be little babies tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive you realize how important that is now in this day an hour we're looking at people where people are so confused that they don't know what the mark of the beast is they don't know whether they should be concerned about a chip in the hand or not they don't know whether they should be concerned about what people are telling them or not because listen the antidote to confusion is the Word of God and the only way that you cannot be confused in this hour it's tough to come to a command a place in the word that no matter what the devil throws at you he doesn't know what to do with you because you are not confused even the Bible says the whole world will be deceived by the beast and that all those things the whole world will be deceived except for that small little group of the elect there will be a little group that will not be deceived why because they will be the word walking on the earth and you see this this hope this whole process of growth don't get tired on me now Rod's awakened from that slumber this whole process is to build your character and not our own character but the character of Christ in us you know that'll change your perspective about church because church is not for baby in your feelings church is for character development churches to build up not little hothouse plants but to build a plant that can stand the wind and the rain and the dust storms and all of the things that didn't ever can throw at it just build up a plant that maybe if they put you out of your house and put you out on the street you'll say I'm standing with God newer garlis maybe like like job when God took away his whole family and everything he owned job said though slay me yet will I trust him that is a kind of plant that God wants to mold us into in church okay a plant with cared a godly Christian character molded in us you know I was thinking about I was looking at all the different kind of tests that that that brother branham went through and kind of compared with a different kind of test that brother Brett that Abraham went through and all the different ones in Scripture because as God is building our character he's he's testing us to see what we're gonna do with his word do you know I believe that when Naomi said told her Ruth to go down and lay it at the feet of Boaz that that was a little test how strange that would be though was he gonna think about me go lay down at the feet of Boaz and and then see what's gonna happen in the middle of the night nobody else is out there that says what a strange thing what a strange thing for Abraham to have to go up there and raise his knife up above Isaac's head and put him up there on that altar what a strange thing and you know there was a lot of tests in brother Browns life and the reason I'm going to bring this out tonight is God is gonna test you and when you fail the test don't give up and just lay down and give up but get up get back up and keep going again because there's a lot of chests that brother branham filled God told him to go to Durban South Africa instead of Johannesburg and those all he said all those preachers got around said one of them said do you say that they are you the only one that God speaks to and he said a little argument broke out on the side of the road and that was a mile what a test to see what he would do and he failed that test and he got deadly sick because of it told that little white lie to the IRS auditor when he called and he said well hey he told it he stepped outside and he said tell tell him told his wife tell him I'm not here technically that was true and he felt so bad for telling that little white lie that he went and told the IRS auditor I apologize he made it right he failed the test but he made it right and in the end he looked better to that IRS auditor because he humbled himself and apologized you know the angel told him you when he explained the first in the second pool you were plenty he said I'm so sorry I messed everything up he failed he failed the test but you know he picked himself back up again and he moved on the next time he didn't fail that test he kept that third pool to a sick secret to himself think about that at that time when it when the ball came and right in the middle of that pin and he and he spoke out in love to the bull what cuz gods training him up he's training him up just like he trained David up where he gave him a bowl and a line and he did all that before he got to Goliath so that when David got to Goliath he would be ready to confront that big enemy he was ready and and so God his truth was training up brother branham and speak to this ball speak to the yellowjacket said he told him i didn't mean to disturb you my if we could speak to one another in those words instead of bumping each other on the head if we can say if we can speak to one another like he spoke to those Yellowjackets I'm sorry instead of rolling up an anger and that and then those two people that were making out in the church service says the word was going to forth and and it was a mile what a test whatever you say was gonna happen he's beginning to put to bring him into a speaking condition testing whether his character is the right kind of character or not whatever you say and he says I forgive you my goodness I wondered tonight if you were to inspect your own self and inspect your own life and the way that you react to your children and the way that you react to others in church and your loved ones do you have that same kind of character that you know he maybe he had a right to say something harmful to those people that were disrupting the church service it was not it was not a good spirit make it out in there you you think well I many times we think we've got a right to just slap one another but he spoke in love because he had that kind of a godly Christian character moving up to brotherly kindness and then God begins to trust him to where he could say speak and a squirrel will run out on a limb speak up on the top of that mountain and the wind the snow storm will move back because he's coming to a place where God can trust him if God can't trust you how is he gonna pull the non spiritual gifts into the church if you don't know what to do with them will you run all over the place if somebody begins to speak in tongues that and maybe they don't say the right thing maybe maybe something gets carried away a little bit what kind of character do you have to know how to discern right from wrong that kind of character only comes from the word and God is producing the right kind of character in us you know a lot of times I want to bring this out too we kind of think we think of the new birth if you don't have it as such a great mystical thing that is so far away from you and then when you get the new birth adoption seems like such a great mystical thing like it's so far almost out of reach from us like like we think of Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration with Moses and Elijah standing there and a voice from heaven speaks out and that typing the the adoption ceremony we think of a brother branham going up on that mount and being caught up in a constellation of angels and and all of these great things happening but I wonder if it's really just as simple as you come into your place and knowing what that is coming to a place where God can trust you and maybe maybe there's not any emotion at all maybe it's just as simple you know you know in the book of James a book of acts it tells a little story about how James James was one of the first apostles to die and they left him in the grave he was not raised from the dead or anything but you turn over to uh I think it's acts acts 19 is Cornelius anywhere maybe acts 10 somewhere somewhere toward the end and there's a mention of a little woman named Tabitha and it says her name was Dorcas which means Dover and and you would think that James would have been raised from the dead for his contribution to the church but he was a little woman who says who had done many alms deeds this little woman who said at home and she just sewed as she made Goods for people now now I'm saying something profound here you think that you've got to be a great big somebody to come to adoption which is not the case you can come to a little play a place of adoption just being a little housewife just iron and your husband's clothes doing something for the Lord doing something for his kingdom because his word is being revealed in you and this she was just a little seamstress doing what seems so in scon sequential and yet all the saints he got together and they began to pray and she was raised up from the dead and it said in the in the book because of her many harms deeds because listen God value who serves so much because of her place that she had in the body of Christ and you think your place is worthless because nobody nobody maybe knows what you're doing nobody looks at you and recognizes the place in the position that you have because it might be something where you're just maybe in this day and hour you're just making Mass for the nurses in the hospital maybe you're just sewing patches on your husband maybe your husband is a minister and all you can do is just patch up his clothes but you're doing something that God recognizes you're manifesting the kind of character that God wants to see that's the kind of person that God wants to mold listen the people that are taking in the rapture might not be the great big ministers and things that appreciate all around the earth but it might be a little with a woman with a dirt floor in the middle of Africa somewhere that God comes and says I see the kind of character that I want to see it might be some money that that you would overlook because God is more like something in secret adoption is when he comes and takes you to the side and gives you a little ceremony so just you and God alone the God is doing something that maybe maybe the rest of the world does overlooks but yet God is molding something in you he's molding in you a gold gold tried in the fire that's why we've got to be tested and molded that's why we've got to come to church because God is molding us just like they made that that candlestick the seven golden candle stick in the Old Testament it was beaten gold and I believe that they beat it with love they took that mallet like the ministers are doing the day and they were maybe with as they just to kind of just to kind of dramatize it a little bit beating never swing they would say thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and they would turn it over and say thou shalt honor thy father and mother and it would turn it over thou shalt not bear false witness do you see that's how you're being beaten when you come into the house of God being beaten so that God can look into that that goal and see his own reflection when he can look at you and see his own reflection then that's when you're a candidate for adoption that's when you're at a place where God can begin to open up these deeper mysteries to you begin to take you to the place where he's ready to pour out his spirit into their church and change your body oh oh oh this is not too deep I hope this is as simple so simple that if you're five years old you can get it that God wants to bring you to maturity that the new birth is not the end of the story that when you're born again there's more to the story it's bored when you're born again God now you're equipped for God to put his character his life in you to see to see you withstand the trials you see do you realize that God is building he's building he's building a body he's building a bride he's building you up cuz the 1st Peter chapter 2 says we're for laying aside all malice and all guile and apakah she's and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood that this seems like you're changing that you're changing the story by the bomb now you're talking about building you were talking my plants now you're talking about building but it's all the same story God starts with a little brick in your life and he lays brick after brick after brick until he's built you up as lively stones are built up a spiritual house he's building up a place where he can come and Tabernacle he can't eat cuz he wants to feel every fiber of your being he wants to fill you up so completely that it changes your mortal being and takes you in the rapture he said an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded in other words shall not be confused you will not be confused but you start off with that chief Cornerstone just like you start off with a little acorn just like you start off with a little mustard seed and it grows into a great big tree the problem though is that God is waiting on you I'm talking about building now I know I'm kind of switching the story a little bit bear with me you know when Daniel there in Chapter 9 he got a revelation that they were coming out it was right there in the the 68-year and he got a revelation that they were fixing to leave Babylon leave the bondage of that that that confusion system and come out and go where to the promised land that they were coming to come out and go back to the God's promises and and there was a lot of things involved in that so a couple of years later they had after he got that revelation they the serous drain that Euphrates River and snuck up under the wall and and and the Jews that there was a turnover a political turnover and the Jews began to go out and and as they went they went back first Zechariah began to build the temple and and it was a ruble and and he was coming about it by the to prophet Zechariah and Haggai because you see they had caught the vision of what that prophet had said that they were supposed to do return back to the promised land returned back - the original faith go back to what they had originally taught and they caught the vision of what Daniel had said for them to do well you know all these troubles and things assail them and over time that the things were left off and after a while then Ezra and Nehemiah then they kind of took up that mantle and they began to rebuild the walls because see Daniel had told him that the walls would be rebuilt in trouble sometimes you see you see the point I'm trying to make it was up to them to fulfill that vision Daniel had prophesized that the walls will be rebuilt that they would go back but it was up to them to actually go on that journey and rebuild the walls and they ended up having to rebuild the walls with a with a trial in one hand laying mortar and with a sword in the other hand and you know I believe that what we're looking at is the same thing a happening now because we are living under the vision of a prophet that has restored to us the original faith but now it's up to us to go back and rebuild the Walter it's up to us God is waiting on us we're not we're not waiting on God because God has given us everything that we need in this hour to go back to the promised land to rebuild Jerusalem to rebuild the temple to get everything ready so that God's presence could come and live inside of it again do you know that's why brother Branham preached that sermon there's a sermon the blushing prophet it is because when Ezra got back he looked at the predicament of the people and he realized that the people just like today now now I wonder if you can look with spiritual eyes at the predicament of the people and wonder if they are actually if they actually realize what they're supposed to be doing as we looked at the situation and he saw that the people had United themselves with all these strange wives in other words they had they were taking all these strange doctrines they were uniting themselves with these strange doctrines and they they hadn't let go that there was the notion that you don't need adoption they hadn't let go of the notion that you don't need why do you need to understand the seven seals they hadn't let go all this kind of stuff and Ezra was so anguish to himself that he fell down on his feet and began to wail and cried and he said the Bible says in Ezra chapter 9 verse 6 and he said I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to the my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass has grown under up under the heavens and I believe it will make any born-again Christian brush to look at the situation where you see what should be born-again believers saying I don't believe that I've got to understand what the prophet of God labor to preach and labor to lay out there for the people to understand I don't believe that that we need to that we can profit by this that it's so far out of our reach I believe that would make anybody blush you see what what it what are almost equates to really is Jacob with the birthright you know your birthright is to go back into the promised land and just say I would rather have a bowl of lentils than what God has given me as denying your birthright stew it's almost ten I'm out - the same thing is that the believers did when they got to Cadiz marnya I would rather I would rather just stay in my own predicament than to accept the Word of God and to dive into the word that he's given to us brother Bram said and here you hear me set out shameful it must be as as with a prophet blush before God that the Holy Spirit must have to blush before the Father or the conduct of his children how that how sin has crept into the church the things that goes on in the church today that we will call ourselves the Church of God I don't want to hurt you now but I want to help you in brother Branham at night in 1956 and here you hear me he says that I wonder how the Holy Spirit is how it must as a prophet of old blushed when he stood in the presence of God when he brings the character and the conduct of the church in this day how he must blush when he stands before the Father and says oh they're all separated they're acting like the world they're marrying and giving in marriage the women are and he goes on and so forth you realize the character that the churches make Matt is manifesting it's supposed to be the character of the Word of God that kind of character only comes by hearing the word I know y'all get tired I'm trying to wind up here brother brems said it here you him again there's so many times we preached on here yelling and many times he would preach on Israel why because to come to a place of adoption you've got to get past all these things that Ezra was looking at people living wrong and doing wrong and and you could almost get sidetracked in looking at somebody that you think should be far along and think well I'm just I'm good off I'm just as good if I just if I just do like that person and that's not that's what brother Branham a lot of times he would really be hitting on us it's looking at one another we use one another as our example instead of using the Word of God as the thing that we should be looking at even even so much as loot using like brother branham do you think that your adoption experience may not come like his did where you're caught up in a constellation of angels it may be as simple as that little Dorcas little Tabitha sitting there doing what she's supposed to be finding her place in the word do you see whether I'm said didn't hear you him he said God makes men different and he has diversities of gifts and send them sends them to his church but we just cramped down on one and there you go you see you don't get the wisdom of the Spirit that's the reason God can't place us into the position where we should be in his body for to one is given this sort of a gift to another this sort of a gift to another another sort of a gift and so forth but all the same body but we want to be just exactly like the other one you can't do that you must use the wisdom of the word the Bible's would our blueprint is but you see God is God is what he's given us he's equipped us in this hour he's given us the spirit of adoption it is called the spirit of adoption because God goal his purpose is to bring you to adoption to a place where he can trust you to a place where like you know Jesus was taken up onto that mountain and the Bible says that that voice here you him a place where God can use your lips just like he used Jesus's lips the musicians can come on forward because you were meant to come to maturity the spirit of adoption is working you and God has more for you than just a new birth there's more for you than just to be born again you know we're not we're not standing in the ring like Ezra was when he when he opened up the law to the people and they began to be anguished and began to repent and wonder what was wrong in their lives but I believe that our hearts can still be stirred up within us even though we're not standing in the rain still we're standing before before a fearful requirement because in this in this day we've got we've got to come to adoption we've got to come to a place where God can trust us and can use us that's why I believe I believe that now is the hour of adoption time it's adoption time if they're ever if there ever was an adoption time and now is that time you look out on the things of this world and I think something has got to happen something's got to take place I believe that God has given us everything we need let's stand to our feet and just worship the Lord and just praise Him the sing that song well we it's the unit down [Music] but is prepared for [Music] all things are laid right my be that happen the that means it's harvest time this is and time it's later than you think right is pain now he's waiting on us to me just praising now all things are [Applause] raghu mighty [Music] he let her 30 they and is he second

at a table and all sick all kinds of good food said before him and he just ate and ate and it was like he didn't get full he just kept eating and eating and I believe that's what the bride is doing cuz all you got to do is he eat and eat and we've been eating for a long time we've been eating for a time we're now I believe all things are ready now all things are ready let's take it one more time if you have a need you can receive it right there in your sheets whatever you have need if you need somebody to play with you we're here to pray we do for [Music] all things by who [Music] that has

people know what it is but some have a concern about sunday between services eating what we're going to do is if you want to go out and eat that's fine I'm sure they're opening the drive-through but you can come back what we're going to do is we're going to set the white tables out underneath the awning so we can do our social distancing because it does get kind of crowded in between services but we we want you to stay but we will have those out here and the picnic tables it's going to be 83 degrees so it won't be so bad we make them put some fans out there or something but we'll work on that

we ain't gonna have to worry about money politics and rules because we'll all be in glory and we'll all be eternal and this'll all be over and I stand by that brother Collins today he fought a fight he won the race he don't have to hurt no more ain't gotta worry about no virus in that dimension he took it he took all that he built that brother Bible told me he took every bit of that that God gave him inside and he just stepped over into another dimension couldn't take his human body with him cuz it wasn't time yet so now we're gonna honor the human body and put it in the grave the Bible says we plant them in corruption but God's gonna raise them in in corruption but God will not raise them until we get ready you and I are the voice of that resurrection in the world today so you just keep praying for each one pray for the world that this thing will be settled at least for a little while so we can get back together but thank you for some distancing sure enough wash your hands those of
