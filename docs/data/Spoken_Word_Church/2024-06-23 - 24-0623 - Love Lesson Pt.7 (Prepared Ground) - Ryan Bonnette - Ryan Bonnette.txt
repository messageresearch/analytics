========================================

also pray for me teaching Sunday school here again this morning filling in for brother Bob so uh we've been on this series on love lessons I call them love lessons um and this one here is titled prepare your ground and last time I was talking on passion and and just making sure that we put that passion in our love not just be coming to church and serving the lord just you know just to be doing it but really be passionate about what we do and and in our our marriage as well um all of our love relationships you can put the passion in there um because it really makes it uh you know more meaningful if you're passionate about everything you do and really put your heart into it but on this lesson we're going to talk about preparing your ground I kind of keep going back to the foundation of our Christian Journey going back to the start back to the beginning laying that good foundation of faith and love falling in love with the Lord and that makes a big difference on how you grow and mature as a Christian so uh that's why I keep seeming to to pull back towards that for some reason I just can't seem to get off that I want to really make sure we're laying a good foundation and not neglecting that first love that we have for the Lord and uh preparing our ground to receive from him so let's go to the Lord in prayer about this lesson this morning Heavenly Father pray you bless this lesson and let it be a blessing and encouragement to your children Lord pray pray you just give me the words to speak and and say what would be true and right and and pleasing to you and be a help to them in Jesus name amen so we're looking at this scripture here in Mark 4 which is also found Matthew 13 and Luke 8 but I pick this one to read from um Mark 4:1 and he began again to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the Sea on the land so the setting is he's going to be in that ship there in that preaching to the people on the land and he taught them many things by Parables and said unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out a sewer to sew and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fouls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no death of Earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit and the other fell on good ground and did yield fruit and sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear so there's a great key in this parable he said unto them know ye not this Parable how then will you know all Parables so there's something about this Parable that if you understand it it'll open a lot of things to you the sewer Seth the word now he's talking to his disciples I skipped one little section there but in this he's talking more intimately just to just his disciples the swer Seth the word and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh and immediately taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and the so there's four groups bear that in mind which one of these four are you there's four groups here these are they likewise which are swn on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake immediately they are offended the devil despised es you if you take on the word of God he hates your guts all of hell is against this Revelation he is timately opposed to you if you take on the word of God know that he's going to be against you and that afflictions and trials are going to come he is a raging Lon and you'll find as you meditate on these little trials and think about the things that have happened it's no coincidence that you find them reflected in the Bible cuz that same Living Word that was alive in those BBL days still alive today but in you and so it will produce those same trials in you and you'll find yourself in a mark for trial where the disciples were in uh in that ship at the I think towards the end of Mark for and they were being tossed about by the ways and Jesus was asleep on the back of the ship Gabby and I walked through that trial when IA was born I fulfilled that what the disciples did I did I walked out of the hospital that day Saturday night going to the Bible study with Gabby and as I walked out the door there was a young lady carrying home her newborn baby born at the same time as IA this healthy baby going home and she might not even be a Christian here I am serving the lord going to church to a Bible study my baby's dying in the basement may not even be alive when I get back and I said Lord where are you I looked up and I remember saying Lord where are you at she's dying and here you are and we're going to serve you no matter what Lord we're not stopping we're not going to quit serving you you come what may but there's my baby dying in the hospital and I was so foolish asked that question cuz he was there but he was asleep on the ship so he was there and he was working the entire time but I fulfilled what the disciples did they said Lord carest thou not that we perish I said Lord carest thou not my baby's dying so you find yourself walking right in the midst of these trials just because of the sake of the word so you take on the word it's going to come there's trials going to come will you endure he that endures to then be saved Bible says and then here's I think this is the third group these are they which are shwn among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful so you're juggling all these things in life and we all are busy we all have things to juggle and maybe getting sidetracked with trying to accumulate wealth and accumulate things stuff that you won't take with you so it doesn't really amount to a whole lot but we get so busy and so distracted with all those things don't for forget the word of God don't forget to set aside that time of quiet and peace and and just with you and the Lord meditate on the word of God don't be choked don't let the word of God choke away all the I mean those things choke away the word of God from you just a little side note on that from Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Bon said why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job your wife your husband you let your children the cares of this world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsty and hungry is God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last days here notice so God's trying and he's willing but he's just wanting us to just be still and listen and wait and be patient these are this is the force group now this is the group we want to be these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit root some 30 fold some 60 and some 100 I'm going to go ahead and get to that key what I believe and this there's there's one of the other uh accounts in one of the other gospels I think it's in Matthew where he points to this being understanding you hear the word and receive it and understand it well you might say well Ryan I don't understand I give up think about other natural things in life if you don't understand anything math well you need to read the math book don't you you got to study a little bit pass math class you don't understand any subject in school well you might need to get a tutor it's not just going to come automatically and why would the word of God be any different if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks how have you read the book or if you've already read it well why not just keep on reading it till you understand um I don't understand a whole lot as much as I'd like to about the seals so Gavin and I every day we're still listening to the seals brother uh Brother D preached in 1982 and ' 83 we listen every day and talk about what he said every segment of that sermon we those sermons we go back and we we talk about it we're trying and praying for understanding anything you don't understand any of these mysteries of God that have been made real in our day and revealed if you don't understand them they're there they're open they're ready you just got to make yourself available make an effort you know study and pray the thing you don't understand get on your knees and say God help me understand that it's not just going to fall into you just just cuz you're alive in this age you know it's not by just default just cuz you're here so there's a key there hearing and receiving the word of God and planting it down in good ground so the son of man here I I did my best to get some pictures recent photos of our ministers they're they're in there somewhere and all that collage of photos you can find our ministers and some other ministers there the point is the son of man today is sewing the seed through our ministers through our five-fold ministry he's here sewing the word of God down but are we bringing the right kind of ground to receive it that's my whole point of this lesson prepare your ground to receive the word of God God what kind of ground are you there's good soul and there's bad Soul are you that real good moist uh nutrition uh Soul full of nutrients and things or are you that dry hard Stony soil where the where the word can't really get sewn down and get rooted good so how do you make your ground good to receive the seed word of God it's a question we're thinking about for a while how do you make your ground good to receive the word of God think about it just meditate for a moment on that form good habits of reading the Bible and praying and meditating on the word of God uh it's one thing I believe in in life is forming good habits you know and with so many things I could go into that for a while but just just suffice it to say forming good habits every day of keeping the word of God open before you um having all these channels open between you and the Lord any anything and everything you can do to make yourself available to God that's preparing your ground that's making yourself available making that ground good give uh time give God time to reveal it because that takes time uh you might study and pray on something for a while but then just let let it sit for a while you know you you sewn down the word of God of that thing whatever that subject is you're that mystery you're trying to understand you just wait a little while let God put a man in the pull pit to open it to you or or bring it in his time um don't neglect your daily bread the word of God again as I said baby steps I wrote down here baby steps everything God does is a slow process it's not uh nothing no quick get rich quick scheme here this is a slow process like brother Wade says a Crockpot not a not a microwave religion we believe in crockpot slow cooker H this is quite a few slides on this uh quote I guess I might just read the highlighted portion for the sake of time but works is Faith expressed brother vom said it's got to be revealed to you then you see who Jesus Christ is now here predestinated plan is in view Plain View just as other seed the word of God is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sew seed if you sewed it just throw it out there on the ground it would not do it would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among thistles and Thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon Jesus parable said so so the ground has to be made ready first so God in soling Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he fornew you by his for knowledge and ordained you to eternal life M say all he's Justified he's already glorified so he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered out of these things and what you have now is God leading you to a place where he's ordained you to be it's the ground it if the ground isn't prepared before it it can't grow that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching Faith see the discernment of the Lord see what takes place all the gifts of the Bible working people work themselves up I think in one place brother banon said in these in a typical service you can ba basically see all four of these groups kind of uh manifesting um different people interacting different ways with the word of God as it comes forth and all of them taking it in different ways based on their ground really that's prepared whether their ground is prepared or not um like my little Eagle last night he knew when he heard the the scream of that mother Eagle there's not a lot of difference between that and the cluck of the hen because see he was there's a l lot of difference between that because he was an eagle from the egg he wasn't made an eagle right then he's always was an eagle and as a a Christian always was that's the reason divorce when you divorced because you were trapped into it your first parents Adam and Eve you became a sinner by Nature you didn't want to be but now you heard the gospel and faith comes by hearing Revelation comes by hearing this little something inside of you another man sitting right beside you say I don't believe that stuff is nonsense I don't believe that nothing nothing to that like they did on the day of Pentecost see here's those different groups right there on the day of Pentecost different reactions to the same word that was being preached the same event taking place these they said these men are full of new wine they know it was it was a great thing to those it was happening to why it was God revealing himself to the individuals not groups individuals While others laughed these were rejoicing it was an individual Revelation which is faith faith that's revealed if it wasn't revealed if it wasn't Faith they wouldn't even be there it was Faith just seeds has has to have the ground prepared first that's our key here what we're talking about today therefore all he forew he called and all he uh called he he predestinated if you was if you want to read that Romans 8 also Ephesians 1 skip on down to that other highlight part we see the message is rejected today isn't it isn't that just what the scriptures said they would do sure all these things ordained of God it should make you walk happy that's the trouble with us today so much difference with the old Christians to the new you know brother Aaron uh the other Wednesday night he was preaching on the divine order he was talking about once you get into that divine order of God there's really no more worry you're walking day by day Faith to Faith Revelation to Revelation even from the very beginning as a very young Christian if you just keep walking in that and don't stop every time I see a new Christian coming into the fold sometimes at work I'll see somebody and they'll tell me they gave their heart to the Lord I said awesome now don't stop just don't stop that's all I'm saying God will bring you where you need to be I don't sit there and tell them about revelation of Seven Seals and seven Thunders and deep things I just say just keep going just don't stop cuz so many I've seen along my journey that just quit you go little ways and then you quit you know and just just don't stop keep coming to church keep reading the Bible keep praying so think about your life today um we're going to get on down to let's go ahead and read uh let's see next slide we'll get into the Book of Joshua here in a moment works his faith ispressed any seeds any seed has to have its ground of course therefore all he forew he's already knew what going to happen Jesus said again about the seeds some fell on rocks others on mixed ground when thorns and thistles and everything else it couldn't grow and others on good ground good ground good soil which had been prepared already prepared all the out here like a chicken looking trying to find it hits into this and then into that but after a while there comes a sudden scream from Heaven he recognizes it right quick that's the word of God he knows it because there's something in his heart been told him been revealed to him or about it now we're going to go to the Book of Joshua chapter 23 be therefore very courageous to keep and do and to do all that is written in the book of the law Moses that you turn not aside there from to the right hand or to the left so now as we're reading this think about your journey in life today think about all the things that try to deter you and try to distract you false Doctrine and and Temptation and trials and all these things that try to rob from you that seed of God that's trying to be planted in you that word of God is trying to come think about that we read this in Joshua that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods say maybe false doctrines uh nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done un this day for the Lord hath driven out from before you great Nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you until this day so there again get in the divine order keep following God he'll fight your battles for you just keep on going one man of you shall chase a thousand he'll do things that you could never possibly do on yourself for the Lord your God he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you take good heed therefore unto yourself that you love the Lord your God there again a key in all these lessons I'm talking about love lessons fall in love with the Lord first that is so key and else if you do anywise go back and cleave to the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and so make marriages with them and go into them and they un you know for certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps in you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until you perish from off this good land which the Lord God has given you think of the good land as being the New Birth the kingdom of God but for today's lesson you can also think about it as being your own good ground that you're preparing for the Lord and you want to fight off all these things that maybe try to uh stop you in your effort you know and making your ground good and our our Joshua today of course is the Holy Ghost so brother Wade was preaching here recently a couple Sundays ago I think about come out of her my people in the Book of Revelation so bear that in mind too as we come up on this verse here and behold this day I'm going the way of all the Earth and you know in your hearts and all your souls that not one thing have failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you not one thing I fail therefore uh thereof therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the Lord your God promised you so shall the Lord bring upon you all the evil things until he destroy you from off this good land which Lord God has given you it really pays heed that we are is really important that we should come out of our own false doctrines our own ideas because it's so so rampant it's not just the Catholic Church we're worried about or denominational churches it's us and our own self even in the message when you have transgressed the Covenant of the Lord your God which he commanded you you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and He Shall Perish quickly from off the land which the Lord God given unto you uh spoken word is Original Seed I'll just start from the top that's the exactly the way Christ has to get him a bride now he's found the so-called group pregnated he's going to seow his seed he's going to do it one way or another somebody's going to get it because they're predestinated to be the church at the end of the road there's going to be a group here no matter what we decide you say it depends on I found predestinate or not well predestination again looks back to God's forn knowledge of your choice so your choice today has has a lot to do with that then like Adam and Jehovah's who found them pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations like God's truth in Genesis 1 every seed has brought forth after its kind so when the spirit fell on her man had been there to her womb and filled it with denominational seed of his own thinking that's why she got to be that way she is Christ couldn't come into her okay think about I believe this was Psalm in in proverbs 30 said I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding so again thinking about that good ground preparing ground to receive the word of God so he went by the field of the slothful if you're going to grow a natural crop you really can't be slothful you've got to work it you've got to plant it you've got to sew it you've got to water it and make sure it has the correct amount of light make sure it's in good soil has the nutrients and all that kind of thing it takes a lot of effort you know so you can't be slothful and do that so here's what happens as salon beheld and lo it was all grown over with thorns and Nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down so all your Fortress is broken down all these false doctrines and things can come in and take that word of God that was sewn down then I saw and considered it well and I looked upon it and received instruction yet a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one thata travelleth and thy want as an armed man so we have to be diligent so don't let our field our walls be broken down and just keep on serving the lord and seeking him be diligent about it it's in my desire that I should chastise them this is Hosea 10 and the people shall be gathered against them and when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows and Ephraim was as an hepher that is taught and loveth To Tread out the corn but I passed over her Fair neck and I will make Ephraim to ride Judah shall plow and Jacob shall break his claws sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in Mercy break up your follow ground for it is time to seek the Lord maybe the ground's been left sitting for a while you know and you need to Stir It Up and get the nutrients and everything good and ready to receive seed for it's time to seek the Lord he's talking about preparing ground as in seeking the Lord here until he come and re righteousness upon you that's God's part he does that we just prepare the ground ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity you have eaten the fruit of lies because thou D trust in thy way the multitude of thy mighty man there's not in anything that's that we good that we can do or any of our strength you know it's all in God but yet we have this part that we prepare our ground make oursel ready we do it every service we come here we should be coming ready and with our ground open um just closing up I guess last few more slides here running out of time so we all live in the sewing and reaping the whole universe is really based on cause and effect sewing and reaping you know when you reap what we what you sew we all know that we can look at examples in the Bible of Adam and Eve and in this case I'm referring to sewing as you know choices you make and you reap from your choices you know your choice of do you prepare your ground or not do you come with an open heart to receive the word of God or not Cain and abble is another good example making choices um this was actually taken from one of my uh later lessons I just wanted to apply this here benefits of reading the Bible every day first of all it brings you to the New Birth gives you Faith Revelation it takes away your unbelief teaches you to love God and others The Living Word word of God it lives in you and through you as I gave that earlier example it actually is a Living Word and as you take it on you'll see it live through you um even through those trials that come gives you joy peace contentment it helps you in your marriage and other relationships gives you stability because there's not any anywhere else there's not any stability anywhere else so in 1 Peter 1 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit of unfa love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible seed by the word of God that liveth and abideth forever you must read the Bible okay um let's see I guess a couple more slides here John 15 if you abide in me and my words abide in you at you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here in is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so God's willing again for us to bear fruit and take on this seed and let him over time grow this fruit and we bear it unto God so shall you be my disciples as the father that loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full James 1 if any of you like wisdom let him ask of God here we are again with well saying I don't have understanding about certain Mysteries uh the musicians y'all go make your way up here uh I don't understand the mysteries of God well ask God that giveth all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable there again I'm talking about stability um is unstable in all its ways so ask God for wisdom and understanding revelation of the word as you read it be absolute he absolutely will help you understand if you make an effort reading his word will give you stability both spiritually and in your life choices let's go and close that off there I'll save the rest of them for next time thank you God bless you amen [Applause] [Music]
