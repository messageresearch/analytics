[2:47] so uh we're gonna
[2:48] read from exodus chapter 14
[2:52] 13 to verses 13 to 25.
[2:57] before we go to the scripture let's just
[2:58] give the lord in prayer

[3:03] gather together around your word and
[3:04] among these precious believers of life

[3:12] lord and not just look on on on just
[3:14] letters lord but something that will
[3:16] actually come alive in our hearts

[3:20] ourselves to to your word tonight with
[3:23] god and give you permission lord jesus

[3:31] down even the aisles of our hearts lord
[3:32] jesus that you might have preeminence
[3:34] through all the rooms in our heart lord
[3:36] jesus said we'll just open up every door
[3:38] and every place every crack and crevice
[3:41] lord that you might come in and inspect
[3:44] and
[3:44] find anything that shouldn't be there
[3:46] lord jesus and just root it out
[3:50] and be with brother dale and terrence

[3:58] lord jesus all the different ones little
[4:00] god we we know lord jesus that you still
[4:02] care for us that you haven't left us
[4:04] lord that you're still moving amongst
[4:05] your people or god
[4:07] and i pray lord jesus the words that are
[4:09] said tonight will be an encouragement
[4:10] and a help lord god to know that you're
[4:12] still ever present help in time of need
[4:15] a time of trouble
[4:17] thank you lord god bless the remainder
[4:19] of this service we pray in your name
[4:24] all right so let's read let's read i i
[4:26] really um i told the brothers in the
[4:28] back i i've just got this one
[4:30] scripture so maybe the rest of the
[4:32] evening i do have a few quotes to read
[4:34] but just just tonight just listen
[4:37] and just just kind of just meditate on
[4:39] the things that are being said
[4:41] and we won't really have anything to put
[4:42] on the board
[4:44] on the screen but just to sit there and
[4:46] listen all right
[4:48] and it says and moses said unto the
[4:49] people fear ye not stand still and see
[4:52] the salvation of the lord
[4:54] which he will show to you today for the
[4:56] egyptians whom you have seen today
[4:59] you shall see them again no more forever
[5:02] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[5:04] shall hold your peace
[5:06] that sounds like a sermon right there
[5:08] that would preach
[5:09] what moses just said there that's
[5:11] encouraging that's a that's a confession
[5:13] and everything
[5:14] hold on you're going to see all the
[5:15] enemy you're going to see uh
[5:18] all your enemies destroyed
[5:20] but then it says notice how how kind of
[5:23] strange and mysterious the scripture she
[5:25] is sometimes
[5:26] the lord said unto moses
[5:28] wherefore christ thou unto me
[5:31] must be something written between the
[5:32] lines here right that moses said
[5:35] something real encouraging it seems like
[5:36] and then all of a sudden the lord is
[5:38] telling him why
[5:39] are you crying unto me
[5:42] speak unto the children of israel
[5:46] that they go
[5:48] forward amen
[5:56] come on
[5:57] but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out
[6:00] that hand over the sea
[6:02] and divide it
[6:04] and the children of israel shall go on
[6:05] dry ground through the midst of the sea
[6:08] and i behold i will harden the hearts of
[6:10] the egyptians and they shall follow them
[6:14] and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and
[6:16] upon all his hosts upon his chariots and
[6:18] upon his horsemen
[6:20] and the egyptians shall know that i am
[6:22] the lord when i have gotten me honor
[6:24] upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon
[6:26] his horsemen
[6:27] now it seems like seems like the lord is
[6:30] kind of reminding
[6:32] moses of what he's supposed to be doing
[6:35] doesn't it
[6:38] and the angel of god which went before
[6:40] the camp of israel removed and went
[6:42] behind them and the pillar of the cloud
[6:43] went before their face and stood behind
[6:45] them and it came between the camp of the
[6:47] egyptians and the camp of israel and it
[6:49] was a cloud and darkness to them but it
[6:51] gave light by night to the east so that
[6:54] the one came not near the other all the
[6:56] night
[6:58] and moses stretched out his hand over
[7:00] the sea and the lord caused the sea to
[7:02] go back by a strong east wind all that
[7:05] night and made the sea dry land and the
[7:07] waters were divided
[7:09] and the children of israel went into the
[7:10] midst of the sea upon the dry ground and
[7:12] the waters were a wall unto them on
[7:14] their right hand and on their left
[7:17] and the egyptians pursued and went in
[7:19] after them to the midst of the sea even
[7:20] all pharaoh's horses his chariots and
[7:23] his horsemen and it came to pass that in
[7:25] the morning watch the lord looked unto
[7:27] the host of the egyptians through the
[7:29] pillar of fire under the cloud and
[7:30] troubled the host of the egyptians
[7:33] and took off their chariot wills that
[7:35] they drave them heavily so that the
[7:37] egyptians said
[7:39] let us flee from the face of israel for
[7:42] the lord fighteth for them against the
[7:46] egyptians you may be seated the lord add
[7:49] his blessing to the reading of the word
[7:53] so tonight i want to take a text
[7:56] anointed to overcome
[7:59] because and and really i y'all know by
[8:01] now i've been really trying to
[8:04] just take a take a message that brother
[8:06] brown preached
[8:07] and just break it down
[8:09] and if it's not obvious to you yet i'm
[8:12] really preaching tonight from the
[8:13] message why christ speak
[8:16] and in this message this message let's
[8:19] let's go ahead and jump to the to the
[8:20] point of the message this message is
[8:23] really not for little baby christians
[8:25] this message is about maturity
[8:28] and
[8:29] and you know the whole brother brahma's
[8:31] message was to bring us to maturity
[8:34] we know that the message was not
[8:35] supposed to give us a new better way of
[8:38] being born again although it
[8:41] it it tied up the loose sins of things
[8:43] that we didn't understand about being
[8:44] born again but the message was given to
[8:47] us to bring to bring a
[8:49] it was a capstone message to bring to us
[8:52] the full revelation of jesus christ
[8:54] which would bring us to maturity
[8:57] the message is supposed to prepare us
[8:59] for the harvest
[9:01] because i was i was sharing down there
[9:02] in mobile about how the the the the plan
[9:05] god's plan for a rapture is that when
[9:08] the original seed is planted in the
[9:10] ground and it begins to grow
[9:12] except the corner we'd be playing in the
[9:14] ground
[9:15] it will abide alone but when jesus
[9:16] christ was planted in the ground by
[9:18] dying for us then this wheat plant began
[9:21] to grow up that began on the day of
[9:23] pentecost and and you see that what
[9:26] we're waiting for is for that wheat
[9:28] plant to come to maturity to come to
[9:31] material again because then you can have
[9:33] a harvest now there's a wheat plant
[9:35] growing up down through the seven church
[9:37] ages typing the whole bride but there's
[9:39] also you also are individual wheat
[9:41] plants and you as an individual have to
[9:44] come to maturity so that's what this
[9:46] message is about that i'm speaking on
[9:48] tonight that to going going from
[9:51] planting to full grain back to the
[9:53] original seed when you're back to the
[9:55] original seed again then you can have a
[9:57] harvest
[9:58] now what kind of perplexes people is it
[10:00] to explain what's gonna what's gonna
[10:03] when can the rapture come well we've got
[10:05] to come to maturity all right now so so
[10:07] you go out into the wheat field and you
[10:08] see a few few different sprigs of wheat
[10:10] or whatever they come up to maturity but
[10:12] the rest of the wheel field is not
[10:14] mature yet well you can't have a harvest
[10:17] that just makes sense as far as just
[10:19] natural farming you can't have a why
[10:21] would a farmer go out if he's only got a
[10:23] couple of wheat plants come to maturity
[10:25] and and go and
[10:27] have the whole harvest now he might take
[10:29] those few little sprigs of of wheat and
[10:32] that that have come up and uh like the
[10:34] priest in the bible will go out and grab
[10:36] a handful and wave it a fir offering of
[10:38] first fruits and that shows though that
[10:41] the whole rest of the heart the wheat
[10:43] field is going to come up to it's coming
[10:45] to maturity so you got to wait for the
[10:48] whole wheat field to come to maturity
[10:50] and then here comes the combine
[10:52] so so this message
[10:54] and it you'll find out that brother
[10:56] brown says
[10:57] where should the bride be right now we
[10:59] should be we should be mature we should
[11:01] have an understanding of who we are
[11:04] and what we're doing here and what our
[11:06] purpose is
[11:08] we're talking about maturity because
[11:10] maturity is what's going to bring the
[11:12] dead from the ground when the bride
[11:14] comes to maturity then that voice in her
[11:17] the same voice that caused lazarus from
[11:19] the ground that voice in her will cause
[11:21] the dead saints to rise from the ground
[11:22] because it will be like a magnet a
[11:24] magnet and the word pulling the word
[11:26] from the ground they're the word waiting
[11:28] on us it doesn't isn't that what the
[11:30] scripture says that they they without us
[11:32] cannot be made perfect they're they're
[11:34] over there waiting on us waiting on us
[11:37] to draw them from the ground so they're
[11:39] waiting on us and so many scriptures
[11:41] that brother that brother brown said
[11:43] that we think that god that we're
[11:44] waiting on god but actually he's waiting
[11:46] on us and what's he waiting on us to do
[11:49] is to actually get in the word
[11:51] and and and accumulate but we'll read a
[11:53] little bit later
[11:55] accumulate all just accumulate the word
[11:57] just accumulate it and and pile it on
[12:00] pile it on until it is actually
[12:02] producing something in us
[12:04] and i i find it to me
[12:06] the more i get into the message and
[12:09] really dig into it and find these little
[12:11] things one one sentence where brother
[12:13] brown says something you just highlight
[12:16] let me tell you it it's worth more than
[12:18] gold
[12:21] i i wonder maybe if
[12:23] those of you that might be a little bit
[12:25] cold tonight and and get a little bit
[12:26] starchy and things if you get back into
[12:29] the message and just really begin to dig
[12:32] you will find that is something worth
[12:35] more than life itself worth more than
[12:37] just anything of this natural earth
[12:40] there's there's things in this message
[12:42] this message will change you it will
[12:45] actually change you and you can look
[12:47] back in your life and see where you've
[12:49] come from and know that this message is
[12:51] actually having an effect you can watch
[12:53] the effect that it's having on your
[12:55] loved ones and on people that go to
[12:57] church with you and look back in their
[12:59] lives and see that they're not the way
[13:01] that they used to be because this
[13:03] message will have an effect
[13:08] i'm trying not to start crying
[13:13] now
[13:14] now now so this the scripture that we
[13:16] just started off with is really is
[13:19] really the end of the story tonight that
[13:21] i'm going to be relating but to really
[13:23] tell the story correctly
[13:25] you got to go back to the beginning
[13:27] because brother branham says that
[13:29] there's a background in this message
[13:31] she's talking about the background now
[13:34] now if you go back and listen to why
[13:36] christ speak it it might be real
[13:38] tempting to just kind of play it in the
[13:40] background and
[13:41] and and you hear brother brown saying
[13:43] things that well i've heard that so many
[13:45] times
[13:45] but really meditate on what he's trying
[13:48] to say he's trying to communicate to you
[13:50] something not not just about moses life
[13:52] or if you listen to it and say well he's
[13:54] always talking about himself
[13:56] well that might be true to some aspect
[13:58] but but what he's really trying to
[14:00] communicate to you is something personal
[14:02] about your journey something personal
[14:06] about you isn't that true about all of
[14:08] the scripture
[14:09] when you look at the seals it's it's
[14:10] fine to look at the seals historically
[14:13] and see how things were open to the
[14:14] first church the first and second and
[14:16] third church age and how it moved down
[14:18] through through history but the seals
[14:20] are supposed to be something personal to
[14:22] you the whole bible when you read it
[14:24] it's supposed to be something personal
[14:25] to you that when you read it you begin
[14:28] to see your your own life identified in
[14:30] it and you begin to see that christ that
[14:32] you're reading about identified in your
[14:34] life to know that that god is not not
[14:37] just some dead history but it's a living
[14:40] resurrected jesus christ
[14:42] so you got to go back in this story go
[14:44] back to get the background first
[14:46] and we'll find brother brown says that
[14:48] moses moses was born with a gift of
[14:51] great faith
[14:52] and and he says he was born to be a
[14:54] prophet and he was born to be a
[14:56] deliverer and he said he was born with
[14:58] the equipment born in him and then he
[15:01] clarifies as every man that comes into
[15:03] the world is born with this equipment
[15:06] with the equipment to choose or to
[15:09] choose to believe or not to believe the
[15:11] equipment to to accept god's providence
[15:14] to accept god's plan or turn it down
[15:18] and then he said not that god is willing
[15:20] that any would perish but all might come
[15:22] to repentance but being god he had to
[15:24] know and and does know the end from the
[15:26] beginning
[15:27] so he's he's laying all this out moses
[15:29] was born with a gift of great faith he
[15:32] was born to be a prophet a deliverer
[15:34] because because moses came into the
[15:37] world with a with a special purpose but
[15:40] you also have a special purpose that you
[15:44] are fulfilling here on this earth
[15:46] moses had a special purpose to deliver
[15:48] all the children of israel but you you
[15:50] got to see yourself in this thing you
[15:53] you're not here sitting in this church
[15:55] just to fill up a pew to warm up you but
[15:57] you actually have a purpose
[16:00] brother graham said he was born in a
[16:02] great family he was born of a very odd
[16:05] birth you think about that he was born
[16:06] in a great family do you do
[16:08] now reflect on this
[16:10] that god will put you in a home
[16:12] i believe he even put rahab uh the way
[16:15] she turned out he put her in the home
[16:17] and he put her in the place he put her
[16:19] in that wall so that so that she would
[16:22] come to the place where she would be
[16:23] able to one day manifest the word of god
[16:25] for her age
[16:27] wherever you wherever you start you
[16:29] might be sitting young people you might
[16:30] be saying well i don't want to be in the
[16:32] house that i'm in i wish i had different
[16:34] parents but god put you in that place so
[16:37] that you would you would be able to
[16:38] manifest the word for your day if you
[16:41] can guess if you can just catch that if
[16:43] you can just catch catch a hold of the
[16:45] promise of god for you
[16:47] he said he was born in a time of
[16:48] persecution like jesus he was born to be
[16:51] a deliverer like jesus he was hid away
[16:53] from the enemy like jesus
[16:55] he come to his time of service now see
[16:58] all this all this comes together to make
[17:00] a background is the person
[17:03] has a purpose and the person is in a
[17:06] place in a nation in a in a in an age
[17:10] that when you see all of the things of
[17:13] the age and the nation come together
[17:15] it's creating a background of faith that
[17:18] that moses that
[17:20] amram and jochebed could look around and
[17:21] see that there's got to be a deliverer
[17:23] come on the scene because they were
[17:25] looking at the circumstances of that age
[17:27] they were looking at the timeline that
[17:29] god had promised to abraham that his
[17:31] children his descendants would sojourn
[17:33] in the strange land for for 400 years
[17:36] and they would be in bondage and they
[17:37] knew after 400 years it had been about
[17:40] 400 years and they knew that something
[17:42] had to come upon the scene and brother
[17:44] brown says that that he said when the
[17:46] time of the promised no grows not draws
[17:49] nigh it sets people to pray and then
[17:52] hungering amen
[17:53] so abram and jochebed began to pray and
[17:56] hunger and call out to god now think
[17:57] think about that in your own situation
[17:59] looking around and well we got we got
[18:01] coronavirus we got
[18:03] strange things in politics we've got all
[18:06] sorts of things all around the world uh
[18:08] uh people in eye places doing strange
[18:10] things it's truly a sodom and gomorrah
[18:13] people don't know whether they're men or
[18:14] women they're they're they're they don't
[18:16] identify with anything they'll get mad
[18:18] at you if you call them their own
[18:19] pronoun they the
[18:21] the world is what it is though is the
[18:24] world is identified biblically it's
[18:26] identified with what the scripture says
[18:29] it would be at the coming of the son of
[18:31] man so if amram and jochebed began to
[18:34] hunger and and something within them was
[18:36] was yearning to see the word of god made
[18:38] manifest how much more should something
[18:41] in us be hungering and draw
[18:43] desiring to see the word of god made
[18:46] manifest to see the promises of god be
[18:48] birthed in us
[18:50] if the bible says that the son of man
[18:52] would be made manifest when it when the
[18:54] world is like sodom and gomorrah
[18:56] shouldn't shouldn't we be desiring to
[18:58] see god's fullness made manifest in our
[19:01] lives shouldn't something in us be
[19:03] hungry and desiring see now is not the
[19:06] time to be watching movies and play it
[19:08] playing with stuff but now is the time
[19:10] to get back into the word and see if we
[19:12] can find the little nuggets that maybe
[19:14] we've left off in our journey maybe we
[19:17] forgot how what a joy it is to get in
[19:19] the message and find out what it really
[19:21] says but now is the time to get serious
[19:24] with god
[19:26] and and brother brown said their prayers
[19:27] were exactly with the scripture they
[19:29] weren't just praying some kind of
[19:31] willy-nilly prayers i want to i want a
[19:33] new porch i want a new cadillac or
[19:34] something but they were praying for a
[19:37] at the delivery that god had said would
[19:39] come up on the scene
[19:41] they were praying according to the bible
[19:43] and he says their prayers was we're the
[19:46] promised word you think about how
[19:48] powerful brother ram said your prayers
[19:50] are and if you can align your prayers
[19:53] with what the bible already has spoken
[19:55] is going to come to pass think about how
[19:57] how much power is in the
[19:59] the the prayer of a believer to know
[20:02] what they're praying for to not get down
[20:04] and just pray haphazardly but to pray
[20:06] with a sincere confession of a believing
[20:08] heart something on the inside begins to
[20:10] speak something begins to move and
[20:12] before long it's not you speaking
[20:14] anymore it's god on the other side
[20:16] speaking on your behalf
[20:18] and he will bring it to pass because
[20:21] when his word is spoken it will not
[20:23] return to him void
[20:25] and brother brahma said god promised at
[20:27] that time to do it they prayed for it
[20:29] and there was a proper child born now
[20:32] now you think if amram and jochebed
[20:34] could pray and that proper proper child
[20:37] that god had promised was born had come
[20:39] come up on the scene through their lives
[20:42] think about what you and i could do if
[20:44] we would get serious about god and begin
[20:46] to call out to god to see the capstone
[20:49] come in our lives to see us grow up into
[20:51] the full stature of a perfect man to
[20:53] come to maturity to begin to realize our
[20:56] place to become that invincible army
[20:59] that barbara said the bride will be when
[21:01] she begins to realize who she is and you
[21:04] see brother adam said all the background
[21:07] all that background of moses life just
[21:09] began to heap up he said all the
[21:11] background begins to heap just keeps up
[21:13] and and what he meant was he said this
[21:16] is going to happen
[21:17] he was born this way he came this way he
[21:20] was he was
[21:21] in the scripture this way and all that
[21:23] begins to
[21:24] uh heap up and he says it accumulates
[21:27] together and draws a picture for us
[21:30] now isn't that just the way that the
[21:32] promised word comes it accumulates
[21:34] together in your heart until little by
[21:37] little you begin to see the picture of
[21:40] jesus christ you begin to see the
[21:41] picture of redemption as it really is
[21:44] that it accumulates in your heart until
[21:46] maybe like paul said through it
[21:48] or it was the song with solomon's we're
[21:50] looking through a lattice and we can
[21:51] barely see we can barely see the picture
[21:54] but a long and long as the word is
[21:56] accumulated in your heart you begin to
[21:58] see things as they really are that's why
[22:01] you've got to get in the word because
[22:03] you cannot see who you really are you
[22:05] cannot truly understand your purpose
[22:07] unless you are in the word all the way
[22:09] and that's why brother brahma said the
[22:11] bride will be in the word all the way
[22:13] she's not going to be dabbling around
[22:15] with denominational ideas she's going to
[22:17] be in the word all the way to understand
[22:20] her purpose
[22:23] brother braham said in
[22:24] spiritual food and due season
[22:26] and again they don't have this back back
[22:28] there but but just just listen
[22:31] and he said
[22:33] i want you to get built up now
[22:35] this is one of my favorite quotes
[22:38] i want you to get built up now
[22:40] in this holy oracles of god
[22:42] in the faith
[22:44] the faith of this hour he wants he wants
[22:46] you to get built up
[22:48] in this faith of the hour
[22:51] the faith
[22:53] is going to take more faith than ever
[22:55] was in any age for this has to be
[22:58] rapturing faith be taken up
[23:01] and so we want you to believe tonight
[23:03] and all that you have seen
[23:05] heard the word that you have preached
[23:07] the signs and wonders that you have seen
[23:09] done we want you to accumulate all that
[23:12] together in your heart and consider it
[23:15] whether it if that be god or not
[23:18] so he's telling us he wants to
[23:20] accumulate all that together accumulate
[23:24] just like all of moses background heaped
[23:27] up until he could look back on all that
[23:30] had accumulated and it gave him faith
[23:32] and brother
[23:34] we'll see in a second that it it
[23:35] actually anointed him that looking at
[23:38] the circumstance and looking at his
[23:40] birth looking where he came from looking
[23:42] how god had dealt in his life built up
[23:45] something until it it accumulated faith
[23:48] in him and brother brown said in the
[23:49] power of the devil in 1955 way back in
[23:52] 1955 he said oh if we could only
[23:54] accumulate that kind of faith tonight
[23:57] get that kind of faith living among us
[24:00] and you know we can accumulate that and
[24:03] god has given us the prescription to
[24:05] accumulate that kind of faith and the
[24:06] way to accumulate that faith is by
[24:08] hearing of the word the the gospel has
[24:11] power in it to when you hear it it might
[24:14] come a little by little precept by
[24:15] precept line upon line but over and over
[24:18] it will begin to accumulate in your
[24:20] heart until you become the living
[24:22] walking manifestation of deity on earth
[24:25] again god manifesting himself back in
[24:27] bride again in a bright form
[24:30] i
[24:31] thank god i feel good tonight
[24:34] and he said and now moses had all this
[24:36] as a background to mo so moses knew he
[24:40] was sent for the very purpose to deliver
[24:43] the children of israel
[24:44] he said he was born with this great
[24:47] gifts and quality within him then it
[24:49] only taken something to flash across
[24:52] that to bring that thing to life
[24:55] and he said the seed of god is actually
[24:58] placed in us from the foundation of the
[25:00] world
[25:01] now now let's think about that
[25:04] brother brown said so many times that
[25:05] you come you come with the seed already
[25:07] in you and what that seems like a very
[25:09] perplexing thing to say does that mean
[25:11] that you don't need to hear the word is
[25:12] a word already in you and you just need
[25:14] like an anointing to come
[25:17] listen the way brother brown says this
[25:18] he says he was born with this great
[25:20] gifts and quality within him
[25:24] listen i want to preach on that tonight
[25:26] because listen i believe that when
[25:28] you're born
[25:30] god knew that you would come into the
[25:31] world before the foundation of the world
[25:33] and he knew what your reaction to the
[25:35] gospel would be he knew that you would
[25:37] accept it and so before the foundation
[25:39] of the world he had a plan and purpose
[25:41] in your life that he laid out before you
[25:44] he knew he he planned out who you would
[25:46] be born from what family you would be in
[25:48] when you would hear the message he had
[25:50] he had an angel with a message waiting
[25:52] for you to wait ready to lay it in front
[25:55] of you and all it took was the light to
[25:57] strike that and what did it strike it
[25:58] struck something where within you was
[26:00] equality god god had and you all
[26:04] god i believe he was looking at you when
[26:05] you were born of your natural birth
[26:08] saying that i know he was born or she
[26:10] was born of the the wrong way
[26:12] but when the light strikes that
[26:14] individual they're going to come become
[26:16] the manifestation of what i had in mind
[26:18] for that person before the foundation of
[26:20] the world i had something in mind for
[26:23] that person and they were born the wrong
[26:24] way but i'm going to make it so they
[26:26] come the right way
[26:27] and you see
[26:30] you see god knew you would be
[26:32] he knew you would be here he knew he
[26:34] knew the hour and the day that you would
[26:36] come to it and all it took was for you
[26:38] to hear the gospel and when you heard it
[26:40] it was like you that that eagle in the
[26:42] barnyard that said i believe it i
[26:44] recognize that's my that's my father
[26:47] calling me i recognize that's my the
[26:49] mother word the new jerusalem calling me
[26:52] i'm born from the word and you recognize
[26:55] where you came from not that you just
[26:57] recognized it and you didn't go through
[26:59] a birth but you come through a birth and
[27:01] you realize that that you you weren't
[27:04] born you you weren't you your original
[27:06] birth is you
[27:08] like brother brown said i i one day i
[27:10] realized i didn't come from uh charles
[27:12] and ella brandon what my real parents
[27:14] but i come from somewhere somewhere that
[27:16] now i can be identified with
[27:20] brother brown said just like that woman
[27:22] at the well that light flight flashed
[27:24] across her path and you think about that
[27:26] woman at the well that she was
[27:28] she was put there beside that whale god
[27:30] knew where she would be and he was there
[27:32] waiting for her he was he showed up at
[27:34] just the right time so that he could
[27:37] flash across their path he is the word
[27:39] and he's shown across their path and she
[27:41] accepted it and believed it
[27:43] [Music]
[27:46] excuse me
[27:47] you know you know the parable of the
[27:49] sower in matthew chapter 13 jesus he
[27:51] actually gave two explanations for the
[27:53] sower the the or the seed and one
[27:56] explanation he said the seed that is
[27:58] sown into your heart is the word of god
[28:00] and if you'll if you'll receive it uh it
[28:02] gave the parable of the the tares and uh
[28:04] the the or or not the tares the the seed
[28:07] falling by the wayside and on the stony
[28:09] rock and all those different things
[28:11] the seed the seed is the word of god but
[28:13] in in in in the other parable and the
[28:15] other explanation that jesus gave he
[28:18] said the seed the good seed are the
[28:20] children of the kingdom so in one sense
[28:23] that seed is the word of god being sown
[28:25] into your heart but in the other sense
[28:27] he's sowing into the earth the
[28:29] individuals that he thought of before
[28:31] the foundation of the world and so you
[28:33] see he thought of you and he knew of you
[28:35] and he had a plan to bring you into
[28:37] manifestation and see all this all this
[28:40] produces a background that's why brother
[28:42] branham is laying it out for us in this
[28:44] sermon that all this produces a
[28:45] background of faith that when moses
[28:48] comes to the red sea he's got all this
[28:50] background that he should be taken
[28:52] advantage of to know his place and his
[28:54] position you see you're not anointed
[28:56] just to be just to let the devil run
[28:58] over to you but you've been anointed in
[28:59] this age to overcome to overcome
[29:02] everything that the devil throws at you
[29:04] and you've got the background to prove
[29:05] it you've got the background to know
[29:07] that god has been with you from your
[29:09] birth he was watching over you he had it
[29:11] planned out when you would let when that
[29:13] light would cross your path he knew when
[29:15] you would receive it and he knew you
[29:16] would receive it and you've got all that
[29:18] background of faith to give your faith
[29:21] to give you faith to cross over your red
[29:24] sea experience when it comes time
[29:28] he said moses born and then brought to a
[29:31] place where he was anointed from
[29:32] intellectual conception to anointing
[29:36] moses he he started out his journey with
[29:39] an intellectual conception but when the
[29:40] light crossed his path he said brother
[29:42] and said notice the seed laying there
[29:44] with an intellectual conception with all
[29:47] the faith that he was born to deliver
[29:49] this people and yet it never come to
[29:51] life until that light from the burning
[29:53] bush flashed across
[29:55] until he seen not something he read
[29:57] about but something he's seen with his
[29:59] eyes something that spoke to him and he
[30:02] spoke back to it oh how that did bring
[30:05] things to life you know
[30:07] i believe that every born-again
[30:08] christian here tonight can look back to
[30:10] your own
[30:11] burning bush experience where you met
[30:14] god for yourself where the word began to
[30:15] come alive and you and you realize that
[30:18] this was not just some fable but you
[30:20] were looking god in the face that the
[30:22] things that you were reading about are
[30:23] true that god is real and he's making
[30:26] his word manifest in your sight you see
[30:28] brother brown said god had a purpose for
[30:30] moses and he has a purpose for you
[30:34] and brother brown said he made this
[30:35] little statement he said if you can only
[30:37] get to that place
[30:39] how much trouble you save god and
[30:42] yourself too
[30:47] if you can only
[30:48] get run to that burning bush experience
[30:51] if you could only get to that place
[30:53] think about
[30:54] those of you that took a long time to
[30:56] get to that place think about how much
[30:58] trouble that would have saved you if you
[31:00] got there earlier
[31:02] think about all the troubles and things
[31:04] that that would have saved you and now
[31:06] maybe those of you that haven't yet got
[31:08] to that burning bush experience think i
[31:10] want you to reflect tonight i'm
[31:12] preaching to you i want you to reflect
[31:14] and how much trouble that could save you
[31:16] if you could just get to that burning
[31:18] bush experience
[31:19] and we know that no man can come until
[31:21] the father draws him but yet the the
[31:24] father is drawing by his word and the
[31:26] word is calling and telling you that
[31:28] there's a place in that burning bush for
[31:29] you that god wants to see you save that
[31:32] god is drawing you if you'll just yield
[31:34] yourself and humble yourself and let
[31:37] loose of all the pride and things that
[31:38] may give you that haughty attitude to
[31:40] think well i'm too good for this
[31:44] yield yourself to the word and let god
[31:46] have his place in you
[31:51] brother brown said
[31:52] he he said i have heard god told moses i
[31:55] have heard the cries of my people and i
[31:57] remember my promise to their fathers
[31:59] abraham isaac and jacob and i have come
[32:02] down ah there
[32:04] the person on pronoun i have come down
[32:06] to deliver them and moses asked he said
[32:09] can i have an evidence
[32:11] and god said yes i'll give you the
[32:13] evidence of the rod
[32:15] throw your rod down and it'll turn into
[32:16] a serpent i'll give you the evidence of
[32:18] the
[32:19] sticking your hand in your in your
[32:20] breast and it bring it out it'll become
[32:22] leprous
[32:23] and see brother brown said from that
[32:24] time on
[32:26] moses had no more questions he said did
[32:29] you ever notice he never run to the
[32:30] wilderness again
[32:32] he knew he was anointed now moses had
[32:35] evidences he had an evidence of the of
[32:37] the rod and his hand and all those
[32:39] things but do you know that the evidence
[32:41] of the new birth to you there is an
[32:43] evidence that you can actually see the
[32:45] new birth working in your life there's
[32:47] all these evidence that the evidences
[32:49] that brother brown talked about other
[32:51] people can see the evidence that
[32:53] something has happened to you that
[32:54] you've been at that burning bush there's
[32:56] been a change in your life because they
[32:58] can tell that your eyes have been opened
[33:00] that they're not shut anymore that your
[33:02] eyes have been opened to the word they
[33:03] can tell that you're speaking different
[33:05] that something has happened to you they
[33:06] can tell that you're walking different
[33:08] and you can tell because listen the
[33:10] whole journey that moses took signs and
[33:13] wonders followed him and signs and
[33:15] wonders will follow the believer that's
[33:17] the promise of god signs and wonders
[33:18] will follow the believer now in the
[33:20] spoken word is the original seed and a
[33:22] lot of other messages the anointed ones
[33:24] at the end time brother brown talked
[33:25] about how the signs and wonders can be a
[33:27] deception maybe the one of the greatest
[33:29] deceptions of this age that's why we
[33:31] don't follow after signs and wonders as
[33:33] an evidence that someone is preaching
[33:35] right or doing right or living right the
[33:37] word is our evidence the word is what
[33:39] separates us and identifies us but yet
[33:42] signs and wonders will follow the true
[33:44] word the a real correct revelation of
[33:46] the word so don't ever get away from
[33:48] expecting signs and wonders if if we are
[33:51] true believers the signs and wonders
[33:53] will follow them that believe because
[33:55] that's a promise in the bible
[33:57] god said i'll be with you so that
[34:00] settles it he said it and so that
[34:02] settles it see we don't have to prove it
[34:04] all we have to do is believe it i
[34:06] preached on that many times before
[34:08] now now you see all this whole this
[34:11] whole message why christ speak is
[34:13] building up to the proof of what the
[34:15] real genuine anointing is that when when
[34:18] moses got to the red sea it didn't
[34:20] matter if he felt something or he didn't
[34:23] feel something it didn't matter because
[34:24] a real genuine anointing is not based on
[34:27] feelings yeah when you when you were
[34:29] born again your natural birth was
[34:32] associated with sensations
[34:35] we're a mixed audience maybe so we're
[34:37] not going to get into that but your
[34:38] spiritual birth had no sensation your
[34:41] spiritual birth was the word of god
[34:43] being born in you and something began to
[34:46] work from the inside out and
[34:48] and it might manifest on the outside as
[34:50] a sensation as a movement as a happening
[34:53] something going on but the birth of the
[34:55] word would happen without sensation so
[34:58] you see you say well what is the
[34:59] evidence of the anointing how do i know
[35:01] if if i have the anointing
[35:05] brother brown said and where i think
[35:06] pentecost failed he said jesus had the
[35:08] greatest anointing that of any man that
[35:11] was ever on the earth is that right
[35:14] he said one day he went into the temple
[35:16] they gave him the scroll
[35:18] he picked it up in his hand he sat down
[35:21] and he read over in isaiah where it said
[35:22] the spirit of the lord is upon me to
[35:24] preach the acceptable year he began to
[35:27] identify himself in the scripture he
[35:29] began to identify and place himself in
[35:32] the word now listen when a believer
[35:34] begins to identify themselves by the
[35:36] word and place their life in the word
[35:38] and be able to see the same things that
[35:41] the scripture says what happened with a
[35:43] believer identified in their life
[35:46] there's a real anointed believer
[35:48] something on the inside anointed by the
[35:51] word something quickened on the inside
[35:53] and you may not feel it because feelings
[35:55] can be to say deceiving you may not even
[35:58] see it with your natural eye because
[36:00] feel sight can be deceiving but you
[36:02] can't deceive a revelation of the word
[36:04] you can't just deceive a true anointing
[36:07] of a believer that's got that's filled
[36:09] with the with the power of god on the
[36:11] inside of their heart
[36:14] he said the spirit of the lord is upon
[36:16] me to preach the acceptable year and so
[36:18] forth the jubilee year and he took the
[36:20] scroll and handed it back and sat down
[36:22] and precious words proceeded from his
[36:24] mouth the greatest anointing that was
[36:27] ever in the world on the lord jesus the
[36:31] greatest anointing and he was not
[36:33] necessarily running up and down the
[36:35] aisle jumping and screaming
[36:37] doing things that normally is what we
[36:39] associate with anointing but yet he
[36:42] would stand standing there at calm
[36:44] assurance knowing who he was knowing
[36:47] what his place was knowing what his
[36:50] purpose was knowing that he was not
[36:52] there just to just to fulfill some whims
[36:55] of the of the of the priests and the
[36:56] sadducees and pharisees of the heiress
[36:59] but he was there to fulfill the the plan
[37:02] and purpose for that age
[37:04] now now what would it be in a real a
[37:06] real believer of this day you see you've
[37:08] got a purpose that you are you are here
[37:10] to manifest in your life
[37:14] he said we methodists get noise confused
[37:16] with anointing
[37:18] noise ain't anointing
[37:20] no no i've seen where there's a lot of
[37:22] noise and not faith enough to cure a
[37:23] toothache see you've got to come
[37:25] solemnly to the father you've got to
[37:27] know exactly
[37:28] where you're standing that's right
[37:31] you've got to know exactly where you're
[37:34] standing so when you begin to accumulate
[37:36] all this background and accumulate all
[37:38] this faith
[37:40] over time over time you begin to know
[37:43] where you're standing
[37:44] you begin to have an understanding of
[37:46] what the word really is what the baptism
[37:49] of the holy ghost really does
[37:51] what your place is in the message
[37:53] what you're really doing here
[37:56] after i'm gonna just share this after
[37:58] after i got done preaching down in
[38:00] mobile one of the young people came up
[38:02] to me and he said
[38:04] i want to know what i'm supposed to be
[38:05] doing here
[38:07] i want to know what my purpose is in
[38:08] life
[38:09] you want to know what that does to a
[38:11] minister to hear a young person come up
[38:12] and say i i want to know what what god
[38:15] wants me to do with my life
[38:18] and i told him you get in the word and
[38:19] you'll find out god will reveal it to
[38:21] you but until you know until god shows
[38:24] it to you until god places you the way
[38:26] he wants you to be you just be a light
[38:29] because that is what god has
[38:30] predestinated every believer to be as a
[38:32] light to the world in your work and your
[38:34] school wherever you go when you walk and
[38:37] talk different from everybody else it
[38:39] will be an example to them it will be a
[38:41] testimony to them
[38:46] this is a story
[38:47] why christ speak the story of moses
[38:49] coming up to the red sea is a story of
[38:52] the anointing accumulating not
[38:54] dissipating it's not a story of god
[38:56] leaving that's the story of god being
[38:58] present but moses maybe not recognizing
[39:01] that he's still on the scene i wonder do
[39:04] we recognize that god is still on the
[39:06] scene in our lives i wonder if we
[39:08] recognize what our purpose is because if
[39:11] you don't recognize what your purpose is
[39:13] what you're doing here you will falter
[39:15] when you get to your own red sea
[39:17] experience you will begin to wonder what
[39:20] we're doing here see this is this
[39:21] message this message is not for little
[39:23] babies again this is a message for
[39:26] mature individuals and that's why
[39:28] sometimes it's so hard to preach because
[39:31] if you're not at a stage of maturity it
[39:34] can seem very confusing so just continue
[39:37] to keep accumulating the word until it's
[39:39] not confusing anymore until you begin
[39:42] accumulation makes the picture clear
[39:44] when you accumulate the word it will
[39:46] make the picture so you can see exactly
[39:48] how it is
[39:51] brother brown
[39:54] he got to the place where he he started
[39:56] looking
[39:56] started talking about looking back at
[39:58] his own life and he began to talk all
[40:00] these life experiences of the boy in
[40:02] finland that was raised from the dead
[40:04] and
[40:04] how he said if this child doesn't raise
[40:06] from the dead i'm a false prophet and
[40:08] killing the care be with 42 inch horns
[40:10] and the silver tip grizzly bear and all
[40:12] those things and
[40:13] he said and it annoys us it annoys us
[40:16] this is a quote when we see
[40:19] that we're living in the last days
[40:22] to find out that all these signs that we
[40:24] see being taken place that spoke of in
[40:27] the scripture would take place in the
[40:28] last days
[40:30] all the way from heaven
[40:32] to the political powers
[40:34] and the nature of the people and the
[40:36] demoralization of the world and among
[40:38] the women and how they would do in the
[40:41] last days and how the men would do and
[40:44] how the churches would do
[40:46] how the nations would do and how god
[40:49] would do
[40:50] and he says and we see it all laying
[40:52] right here on us when you begin to look
[40:55] and to see all these evidences
[40:58] it begins to accumulate in you of faith
[41:00] it begins to anoint in you that now
[41:03] we're actually living in a vision we're
[41:06] actually walking in things that the
[41:08] prophets foretold we're actually living
[41:10] out a vision and you have a place in
[41:12] that vision because you're a part of
[41:14] god's plan
[41:16] he said it anoints our faith it moves us
[41:19] out in the great cycles and he said we
[41:21] were predestinated for this hour and
[41:24] there is nothing going to stop us from
[41:27] seeing it my you think about a promise
[41:30] like that if you stay in the word there
[41:33] is nothing going to stop you from seeing
[41:36] it if you just keep walking in the word
[41:41] he said listen as long as you're walking
[41:44] in the word you actually have authority
[41:47] over the devil amen
[41:57] everybody doing all right
[42:01] you see faith
[42:03] is recognizing your purpose
[42:06] these do you see that's where as we get
[42:08] up to the to the end of the story i'm
[42:09] not there yet so well i've still got a
[42:12] ways to go we gotta
[42:14] we got a little bit further to go but to
[42:16] the end of the story moses faltered at
[42:18] recognizing his purpose
[42:21] do you see the power and in that quote
[42:23] where beram said when the bride begins
[42:24] to recognize who she is
[42:27] she will be an invincible army
[42:29] when we come to maturity when the bride
[42:31] becomes to a place of maturity you're
[42:33] supposed to recognize what you're doing
[42:35] here and recognize your purpose that
[42:37] you're not here just to just to be part
[42:38] of a lodge that you're actually here to
[42:41] overcome the devil to show the devil
[42:43] that that there is going to be a bride
[42:46] in this day that will believe every word
[42:49] of god that will not do like eve and
[42:51] falter it one word but she will believe
[42:54] all the word of god she will she will
[42:56] believe every last word of god and she
[42:58] will be able to take the hebrews 13 8
[43:00] test that says hebrew
[43:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[43:04] forever she'll be able to pass that test
[43:07] and you see that is what your purpose is
[43:09] your purpose is to prove to the devil
[43:11] that god is going to have a bride it
[43:13] come out of satan's eden
[43:15] come out of the where god is
[43:17] the god of this evil age has elevated
[43:19] himself to a place of worship put
[43:21] himself
[43:22] at a place of maturity god has also got
[43:25] his bride is coming to a place of
[43:27] maturity
[43:30] the brother said moses esteemed the
[43:32] reproach of christ greater riches than
[43:34] the treasures in egypt for he had
[43:36] respect under the recompense of the
[43:38] reward and he talked about how
[43:41] moses by faith he was watching what
[43:44] would be and this is a very i wonder if
[43:47] you ever really meditated on how brother
[43:49] branham explained faith in this sermon
[43:51] because usually we think of faith being
[43:53] something looking present tense but here
[43:56] in this sermon brother brown says that
[43:58] faith is looking
[43:59] watching what will be
[44:01] now think about that think if you're
[44:03] sitting there in your bed of pain
[44:05] moaning with sickness and ailments if
[44:07] you begin to look at what god has
[44:09] promised that you will be and walk into
[44:12] that you will walk into what his word
[44:14] says you will be
[44:16] if you're sitting there in sickness and
[44:17] you you look at what he says you will be
[44:20] not what you are you will walk into that
[44:24] you see how important it is to look at
[44:26] what his word says you will be as we get
[44:28] as we get to the crossing over the red
[44:30] sea crossing over into a glorified body
[44:34] you look to that knocked to your present
[44:36] condition you look you're looking to the
[44:38] unseen what his word says will be
[44:42] he said look at tomorrow instead of
[44:44] today
[44:46] look at the promise instead of the
[44:47] glamor and then in this message he
[44:49] spends maybe 15 minutes hitting on how
[44:51] people look at look at glamour look at
[44:53] the magazines in the supermarket look at
[44:55] the movies and things and they try to
[44:57] pattern themselves after the glamour of
[44:59] the world and he says doing that
[45:02] this is an extraordinary statement
[45:04] looking at the glamor of the world will
[45:07] paralyze your faith
[45:09] but he says don't let that paralyze your
[45:12] faith but let your faith paralyze their
[45:16] circumstance
[45:17] now think about that if you're looking
[45:19] to the promise of god in his word if
[45:21] you're looking to that then that
[45:23] actually paralyzes the circumstance all
[45:26] that disease is creeping up your body
[45:28] but looking to god's word will paralyze
[45:30] that it won't be able to move anymore
[45:32] because your faith is looking at god's
[45:34] word look at god's word and and your
[45:36] lost children it will paralyze the devil
[45:38] being able to move in their life because
[45:40] you're looking at what god's word says
[45:42] that there's a promise that me and my
[45:44] house the promise just like as in the
[45:46] days of of the israelites when they put
[45:49] that lamb's blood over the little of
[45:50] their door it was for the whole house
[45:52] and if you'll look to god's word it will
[45:54] paralyze anything that the devil can do
[45:56] in your house it will paralyze what the
[45:59] devil's doing
[46:00] [Applause]
[46:01] see brother said moses faith took the
[46:04] word of god he said faith sees what god
[46:08] wants done
[46:09] you see where he began to falter at the
[46:11] red sea
[46:12] he didn't realize he began to falter at
[46:15] what god wanted done
[46:18] listen meditate on this as i'm speaking
[46:21] now all of these things are beginning to
[46:23] accumulate in your heart that you must
[46:25] know the plan and purpose for your life
[46:27] in god's word that god wants something
[46:30] done and if you can if you can begin to
[46:32] get a revelation of what god wants done
[46:35] and stand firm on that you can come like
[46:39] all the saints of old that didn't have
[46:41] to go pray to check up uh whether or not
[46:44] it was god's will for them to be healed
[46:45] or whether or not it was god's will for
[46:47] a
[46:48] after the day of pentecost to receive
[46:50] the holy ghost you don't have to go pray
[46:53] to check up whether it's god's will for
[46:54] you to do these things because it's
[46:56] written in his word and if he'll stand
[46:58] up on the word he's already gave the
[47:00] promise he's already said what he wants
[47:02] done with the word a mature believer
[47:05] knows what god wants done with the word
[47:06] and they begin to speak it because they
[47:09] know what he wants done they believe it
[47:11] and they can say it
[47:13] see brother and said faith doesn't look
[47:15] at the present time faith looks to what
[47:18] god wants and works accordingly
[47:21] faith is a long-range vision it sees
[47:24] what god wants and works through that
[47:27] and then brother brown began to use the
[47:29] the metaphor of the of a man looking
[47:31] through binoculars and he said that's
[47:33] like somebody looking through the old
[47:34] and new testament so if you want to have
[47:36] clarity on what god wants you have to
[47:38] look through the word through the
[47:41] binoculars of god's word of the old and
[47:43] new testament held up together to be
[47:44] able to see clearly what god wants
[47:48] and see then it becomes
[47:51] then it becomes
[47:52] like reading the bible becomes like
[47:54] reading tomorrow's newspaper it'll
[47:57] become like reading what god will
[47:59] fulfill in your life tomorrow if you
[48:01] just keep walking in his word
[48:03] you see
[48:05] you see it was written that you would
[48:06] overcome in revelations chapter three
[48:08] that there will be a
[48:10] overcomer in the age of of layout of sea
[48:12] it was written that your your hearts
[48:14] would be turned back to the original
[48:16] faith in malachi 4. malachi 4 wasn't
[48:19] just about a prophet but it was about
[48:20] your heart being turned back by the
[48:23] preaching of the gospel in this day it
[48:25] was written that in first peter chapter
[48:27] 2 ye also as lively stones are built up
[48:31] a spiritual house that was written of
[48:33] you and you see that's god's purpose and
[48:36] plan for your life is to be built up as
[48:38] lively stones and it was written that
[48:40] you would cast out the devil in mark 16
[48:44] how would you cast out the devil by the
[48:46] word by the revelation of the word in
[48:48] your life you would see the devil
[48:49] leaving you by the revelation of the
[48:51] word you can cast out the devil and
[48:53] others if they will believe your word by
[48:55] the revelation of the word god has given
[48:57] his church power to cast out the devil
[48:59] by the word you have authority over the
[49:01] devil
[49:02] that is fulfillment of scripture people
[49:04] in the bible were promised something
[49:06] that their offspring were seeds and many
[49:08] times many times you know abraham was
[49:10] promised the promised land
[49:12] paul was promised
[49:14] but he promised the thessalonians the
[49:15] rapture paul promised the corinthians
[49:17] the change of the body a jesus promised
[49:19] spoken word power to the disciples but
[49:21] it and it didn't happen necessarily in
[49:23] that in that time period but it was
[49:25] something that would be manifest in a
[49:27] later day and now we're living in the
[49:29] day when all of these promises are
[49:31] rolling up to be gathered up to heaped
[49:34] up to be fulfilled in your life
[49:39] you talk about being excited by the
[49:40] message
[49:41] all of these promises are here for them
[49:43] to be fulfilled in your life and that's
[49:45] what that's the problem that moses had
[49:47] there the red sea he lost sight of the
[49:49] fact that all those things that had
[49:52] accumulated up in his life all those
[49:54] promises that he was there he was
[49:56] predestinated to fulfill he lost sight
[49:58] of his purpose in god's plan
[50:09] brother graham said
[50:11] there is no fear in faith
[50:14] moses faith never did fear pharaoh
[50:18] he said faith as i've always said it's
[50:20] got great big muscles and hairs on the
[50:21] chest
[50:23] faith said shut up and everybody shuts
[50:25] up that's all i know where i'm at
[50:27] the rest of them say well
[50:29] well now
[50:31] maybe he does
[50:33] with that kind of confidence speaking
[50:35] out somebody that really really believes
[50:37] what they're saying
[50:39] that'll make everybody else turn and
[50:41] look maybe he does know
[50:44] what he's talking about all right
[50:45] brother ryan said you got to show your
[50:47] muscles
[50:48] this is when the devil comes around and
[50:50] begins to say buddha you've you've got
[50:51] to say boo back
[50:53] don't let yourself you do not have to be
[50:55] run over by the devil
[50:57] listen the devil the devil will try to
[50:59] run over you with complexes and things
[51:01] he'll try to sit on you with a sickness
[51:03] and make you think well this is just how
[51:04] it is now but there's a promise in god's
[51:07] word of deliverance you don't have to
[51:09] let the devil run run rough shot all
[51:11] over you
[51:14] brother said pharaoh said if you do this
[51:16] that will see
[51:18] just so far and he began to talk about
[51:20] how pharaoh said now now let the elders
[51:22] go out into the into the desert but
[51:24] don't let the people begin to get a
[51:25] revelation of what i'm talking about
[51:27] you can just go just so far go out for a
[51:29] little way and do what your little
[51:30] sacrifices in the wilderness but then
[51:32] come back the next day just go so far
[51:34] isn't that the way the devil wants us to
[51:36] do is just just go so far now now we
[51:39] can't like some of the young people say
[51:41] we we can't get the capstone until until
[51:43] we go in the rapture then we'll be we
[51:45] can't ever be perfect in this life
[51:47] listen how are you going to be per the
[51:49] blood of jesus christ was given to make
[51:51] you perfect he atoned for you so that
[51:53] you will be made perfect it's not he
[51:55] it's not our righteousness that we're
[51:57] looking at it's not our righteousness
[51:59] that god is looking at he's looking at
[52:00] his own righteousness his atoning grace
[52:02] his atoning blood that he paid the price
[52:05] so that we could have his perfection he
[52:08] took his our sin upon himself so that we
[52:10] could have perfection in him
[52:14] i see brother brown said the faith that
[52:16] moses had didn't believe in us so far
[52:18] religion he said we're all going we're
[52:20] all going we're all going
[52:22] all the way that's what my confe i want
[52:25] my confession to be tonight is that
[52:26] we're not going to leave any stragglers
[52:28] we can say maybe like the marines no
[52:31] soldier left behind we're all going if
[52:33] you'll if you'll just
[52:35] yield yourself to the gospel believe the
[52:37] word that's going across the pulpit
[52:39] that's being said on the tapes we're all
[52:41] going all the way
[52:43] and he said brother brown said that i'm
[52:45] so glad that a man can completely serve
[52:48] god till he the devil don't know what to
[52:50] do with him you see that's what happened
[52:52] was moses was so completely yielded to
[52:54] god pharaoh and all the egyptians didn't
[52:57] know what to do with him until finally
[52:59] they said i can't do anything else with
[53:01] you so just get on out of here
[53:04] a real true son of god that comes to a
[53:07] mature place after a while the devil
[53:09] he'll circle you now he's not going to
[53:11] leave you alone but he'll continue to
[53:13] circle you and poke at you and try you
[53:16] until finally the bible says resist the
[53:19] devil and he'll flee from you and he'll
[53:20] flee from you
[53:22] he said moses served god so completely
[53:24] until the devil didn't know what to do
[53:26] with him but you see
[53:28] it's building up your confidence
[53:31] all of these things accumulate
[53:33] until you can see god you can look back
[53:36] in your own life and see god working in
[53:39] your life from your new birth all the
[53:40] way to your present condition
[53:43] see god god was constantly working in
[53:45] moses life all through his journey to
[53:48] vindicate the claim that he was who he
[53:50] said he was
[53:52] and he is working in the heart of every
[53:53] believer to vindicate the claim and
[53:56] their life of who they say they are if
[53:59] you say that you are a real true
[54:01] born-again believer god is on the scene
[54:03] to vindicate that claim if it's true if
[54:06] you're not a hypocrite he is on the
[54:07] claim and he was on the on the scene to
[54:09] vindicate in moses life when moses said
[54:12] let the w river turn to blood god was on
[54:14] the scene to vindicate that when he said
[54:16] let frogs come out let lice let fleas
[54:19] let boils come on on the cattle god was
[54:22] on the scene to vindicate that and he
[54:24] was on the scene that time you were
[54:26] seeking the new birth he vindicated your
[54:28] claims as you as you
[54:30] as you laid the scripture in front
[54:33] laid your scripture out there and said
[54:34] god i'm confessing what the promise that
[54:36] you already made he vindicated it that
[54:38] time you needed healing that time you
[54:40] had a problem at work or maybe that time
[54:42] that you were confronted with false
[54:44] doctrine god came on the scene and
[54:46] delivered you from that he was there all
[54:48] those times if you could just look back
[54:50] and see all the times that god was on
[54:52] the scene
[54:53] isn't that what brother brown was
[54:54] preaching in the seventh seal when we
[54:56] the first time we were listening that we
[54:58] thought well it seems like brother brown
[55:00] was talking about himself an awful lap a
[55:02] lot but he was looking back at his own
[55:04] journey so knowing that god had taken
[55:07] him from a place he took him on a
[55:09] journey
[55:10] and he knew
[55:11] he knew where he was positionally
[55:17] so let's get to
[55:18] let's get to the point of the message
[55:23] in exodus chapter 14 verse 13 it says
[55:25] and moses said unto the people
[55:28] fear ye not stand still and see the
[55:30] salvation of the lord
[55:31] which he will show to you today for the
[55:34] egyptians whom you have seen today
[55:37] you shall see them again no more forever
[55:40] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[55:41] shall hold your peace
[55:43] now moses makes this bold declaration
[55:46] seems like a a brave confession
[55:49] perfectly in line with god's word
[55:51] perfectly in line with what it's about
[55:52] to take place
[55:54] but then there must be a little gap in
[55:57] this and something hidden there
[55:59] something that took took place
[56:01] maybe maybe all of a sudden moses just
[56:04] felt real downtrodden maybe he felt
[56:07] maybe this just he didn't feel anything
[56:10] maybe he was standing there and he
[56:11] didn't he didn't feel the anointing
[56:13] anymore now what are you going to do if
[56:15] you don't feel the anointing
[56:16] do you have to constantly feel something
[56:18] in your life to know what god wants you
[56:20] to do do you have to constantly see
[56:23] lights and see things now listen don't
[56:26] fall asleep on me now now it's not the
[56:27] time to fall asleep
[56:29] arise and possess your inheritance let's
[56:31] wake up arouse yourself just for a
[56:33] little bit lord
[56:37] brother graham said he back there back
[56:39] there
[56:41] he waited say now lord i'm just a baby
[56:44] let me tell you now
[56:45] he's saying back there
[56:47] and mo at the beginning of moses life
[56:49] when he was just a baby
[56:51] he moses could say let me tell you now
[56:53] he said yeah i'll go do this i've got
[56:54] they say of the lord brother is that
[56:56] thus saith the lord yes yes brother
[56:58] moses that's thus saith the lord yeah
[56:59] and it happened never failed
[57:01] one time never did fail but he said he
[57:04] wasn't a baby anymore
[57:06] now it might have been fine for him to
[57:07] cry and boohoo and and look for
[57:10] anointings and things back then but now
[57:12] he's not a baby anymore what should the
[57:14] church be the church should not be
[57:16] something that you have to baby and and
[57:18] cuddle and and say nice things for them
[57:20] to come to church the church should be
[57:22] at a place where they know what they're
[57:24] here for and you don't have to prod them
[57:26] to come to church
[57:29] brother said god had performed
[57:31] everything perfectly
[57:34] he started them on their journey
[57:36] he's got the church together they've
[57:39] been called out they come from every
[57:40] denomination and he said god brother i
[57:43] said and god said now i've gotten them
[57:44] started on their journey
[57:46] they're all done called out
[57:48] the church is together so i've got them
[57:51] on their journey now moses take them on
[57:54] over
[57:55] i've told you to
[57:56] i'm going to sit down and rest a while
[57:59] now
[58:01] what this means
[58:03] brother rob you're not supposed to
[58:04] interpret what i'm saying
[58:08] now listen
[58:09] god's not going off the scene but he's
[58:11] got he's got a place of confidence
[58:14] see this message is about confidence
[58:17] but god looks at you and he's got
[58:18] confidence that you know what you're
[58:20] doing after all this training all this
[58:22] time he's brought moses up into a place
[58:24] now you should know what to do and he's
[58:27] like okay moses you know what to do do
[58:29] it
[58:30] you know what you're here for do it you
[58:32] don't have to come beg and cry and plead
[58:34] with me to to find out what you're
[58:36] supposed to be doing here you're
[58:37] supposed to know what to do and you're
[58:39] supposed to just speak and go forward
[58:43] brother brown said
[58:44] here it is and the circumstances comes
[58:46] up again he's got on the journey the
[58:48] church is already called out and they're
[58:50] moving up and moses started crying out
[58:52] lord
[58:53] is it thus saith the lord what what must
[58:56] i do
[58:57] is it thus saith the lord for people to
[58:59] be healed is it thus do i need do i need
[59:02] brother brahm to come back from the
[59:03] grave so that we can have thus saith the
[59:05] lord or do we have confidence in the
[59:07] words that he's already spoken that they
[59:09] are thus saith the lord that when you
[59:11] have a revelation of what god wants done
[59:13] with his word it is thus saith the lord
[59:15] and you don't need to go boohoo and cry
[59:17] to find out whether god wants done with
[59:19] the word what he's already said he wants
[59:21] done with the word he's already put
[59:23] these promises in the word and you don't
[59:25] have to go cry and grovel at his feet to
[59:27] find out what he wants done with the
[59:29] word
[59:30] he's already said you can be healed if
[59:31] you believe it he's already said that
[59:33] we're going to take a body change we
[59:35] don't have to go cry and grovel to find
[59:37] out if he's if we're going to take a
[59:38] body change
[59:39] we don't have to cry and grovel to find
[59:41] out if these virtues are required we
[59:43] know we know what god wants done with
[59:45] the word you see
[59:46] we don't have to
[59:48] you see he's talking about moses but
[59:50] he's talking about you and i he's
[59:52] talking about us where do you see
[59:54] yourself in this plan right now
[59:57] moses said oh lord look look coming here
[59:59] comes pharaoh
[1:00:01] here comes after all the things that god
[1:00:04] had done how how he had
[1:00:06] by moses mouth spoke fleas and lice and
[1:00:10] all the different things that all the
[1:00:11] plagues by moses mouth and now moses at
[1:00:14] a place where he said oh trembling in
[1:00:16] his knees look at look here comes
[1:00:19] pharaoh the people are all what must i
[1:00:21] do
[1:00:21] what must i do see there isn't that just
[1:00:24] human beings
[1:00:27] now see
[1:00:28] that's the same thing that we might be
[1:00:30] doing looking around at circumstances
[1:00:33] looking around at all the the pandemic
[1:00:35] and and maybe shaking it out what are we
[1:00:37] gonna do
[1:00:38] i can't go to church now even if i wear
[1:00:40] a mask i'm afraid listen now is not the
[1:00:43] time to be looking at circumstances now
[1:00:46] is not the time to be looking at the
[1:00:47] glamour of the world now is the time to
[1:00:50] look forward to the promises of god what
[1:00:53] god wants you to fulfill
[1:00:55] he has already said in his word he wants
[1:00:57] you to do and to walk in it and to put
[1:00:59] one foot in front of the other until you
[1:01:01] see it being made manifest in your life
[1:01:03] and you will see it may manifest in your
[1:01:06] life because he promised it
[1:01:08] we're not following the promises of a
[1:01:09] man
[1:01:10] we're not laying under the shadow of a
[1:01:12] man but we're laying under the shadow of
[1:01:14] the gospel is what brother raymond said
[1:01:15] in this message we're laying under the
[1:01:17] shadow of not just some pretense so not
[1:01:19] just some some something conjured up but
[1:01:21] we're laying under the preach we're
[1:01:23] laying under the shadow of the revealed
[1:01:26] word of god
[1:01:28] now brother brown said now you remember
[1:01:30] he had already prophesied here for he
[1:01:32] said these egyptians that you see today
[1:01:34] you'll see no more
[1:01:36] and then immediately begin to cry out
[1:01:38] god what can we do see after he done
[1:01:40] done a pretty good job and prophesying
[1:01:42] there you see he done told them what
[1:01:44] would happen
[1:01:46] if the word of god was in him
[1:01:48] it was in him
[1:01:50] and when he was telling that it actually
[1:01:52] come to pass
[1:01:54] what he said was already going to come
[1:01:57] to pass and here he was crying out
[1:02:00] what am i going to do
[1:02:04] he had already predicted what they was
[1:02:06] going to do
[1:02:07] that they were going to the promised
[1:02:08] land
[1:02:09] see we're going to the promised land and
[1:02:11] we know where we're going
[1:02:13] but don't falter at the red sea
[1:02:16] you must have confidence in what you
[1:02:18] believe in it's time to flex those big
[1:02:21] faith muscles and stand for something
[1:02:24] brother said he predicted the end of the
[1:02:27] very nation he was brought up we're in
[1:02:30] now let's make this present tense for
[1:02:32] you because the bible says in revelation
[1:02:35] 11 to 15 the kingdoms of this world are
[1:02:37] become the kingdoms of our lord and of
[1:02:39] his christ
[1:02:41] that's the seventh trumpet sounding the
[1:02:43] seventh trumpet sounds to announce the
[1:02:45] kingdoms the end of all the kingdoms of
[1:02:47] the world
[1:02:48] and brother adam said the seventh
[1:02:49] trumpet parallels the seventh seal which
[1:02:52] is what the end you at the end of your
[1:02:55] overcoming journey
[1:02:56] the complete conquering of all of the
[1:02:59] devil's tricks in your life until god is
[1:03:01] manifested completely in you god
[1:03:04] revealing himself in you the coming of
[1:03:06] the lord the seventh seal
[1:03:08] the kingdoms of this world have become
[1:03:10] the kingdoms of our lord and of his
[1:03:11] christ and moses predicted the very end
[1:03:14] of the end of the very nation he was
[1:03:15] brought up in and the bible predicts the
[1:03:18] end of all of the carnal desires all of
[1:03:21] the things that you were brought up in
[1:03:24] it predicts the end of all of this
[1:03:26] carnal nature that you are going to
[1:03:28] overcome this flesh that you're going to
[1:03:31] see and overcome the bible says that's
[1:03:33] going to be overcome and look to that
[1:03:36] look that one day you're walking toward
[1:03:38] that glorified body that's going to be
[1:03:40] the final like brother dale says when
[1:03:42] when that day comes then you'll know
[1:03:44] that you've been born again
[1:03:49] that's fantastic
[1:03:52] see he was called for the job
[1:03:54] man wants to rest and let god do the
[1:03:56] pushing but god wants you to have
[1:03:58] confidence in what you believe in so he
[1:04:01] doesn't have to keep constantly pushing
[1:04:03] you and prodding you now did not i told
[1:04:06] you you can be healed if you believe i
[1:04:07] told you you can receive the new birth i
[1:04:09] told you there's a capstone didn't i
[1:04:11] tell you all these things he didn't he
[1:04:13] doesn't want to keep he wants you to
[1:04:15] come to a place of maturity
[1:04:17] now isn't that what maturity is you see
[1:04:19] you see a grown man in the natural
[1:04:21] acting like a little baby you're like
[1:04:22] that's
[1:04:23] something's wrong there that's not a
[1:04:25] mature person
[1:04:26] the same thing in the spiritual a
[1:04:28] preacher or whatever a minister behind
[1:04:30] the pulpit groveling and acting like a
[1:04:32] little baby that's that's odd that's off
[1:04:34] kilter that god doesn't want us to be
[1:04:36] little babies that have to constantly
[1:04:38] cry
[1:04:39] aren't weaned off the bottle yet but he
[1:04:41] wants us to know positionally how we're
[1:04:43] placed and what god wants us to do here
[1:04:46] moses was anointed for the job his
[1:04:49] claims were vindicated
[1:04:51] it was time for the people to be
[1:04:52] delivered in that the case now is time
[1:04:56] for us to take a body change
[1:04:58] god had drawn them all together in one
[1:05:01] group now we're not all grown together
[1:05:02] in one group physically but we're all
[1:05:05] united by faith
[1:05:07] by one spirit
[1:05:09] one baptism
[1:05:10] one truth
[1:05:12] together we're all united all around the
[1:05:14] world
[1:05:15] everything god had promised he had done
[1:05:18] it
[1:05:19] and he said
[1:05:20] brother brown said he wanted to wait for
[1:05:22] thus saith the lord
[1:05:24] and he said his the very vindication of
[1:05:27] his call
[1:05:28] was thus saith the lord
[1:05:30] he said his job
[1:05:33] was thus saith the lord my you think
[1:05:36] about that
[1:05:38] i'll be honest i was thinking about that
[1:05:40] before i walked out of the office
[1:05:42] that if you're a god called minister
[1:05:44] that is thus saith the lord
[1:05:47] if you're a god called song leader that
[1:05:49] is thus saith the lord if you're a god
[1:05:52] called deacon if you're a god called
[1:05:54] whatever it is if you're if you're a god
[1:05:56] called housewife if you're a god called
[1:05:59] worker in the workplace with your little
[1:06:01] lunch pail that is thus saith the lord
[1:06:04] amen right see a lot of people are
[1:06:06] waiting for brother madam to come back
[1:06:07] from the dead to give us thus saith the
[1:06:09] lord when you've already got it because
[1:06:12] it's already been preached and you've
[1:06:14] already got the saith the lord
[1:06:18] moses was at the red sea waiting for the
[1:06:21] sith lord i wonder could we be at the
[1:06:23] red same red sea experience tonight
[1:06:26] waiting for thus saith the lord when
[1:06:28] we've already got it and god wants us to
[1:06:31] recognize that we've already got it
[1:06:33] you've already got thus saith the lord
[1:06:34] we've already heard all eleven hundred
[1:06:36] sermons we've already heard the word
[1:06:38] preached we've already heard it all
[1:06:40] accumulated accumulated and built up
[1:06:42] within within it within us like lively
[1:06:44] stones built up into a spiritual house
[1:06:47] built up built up until now we should be
[1:06:50] standing as mature believers knowing
[1:06:52] what we're doing and able to speak it
[1:06:55] yes amen
[1:06:59] and said god must have got fed up
[1:07:02] he said why are you crying to me
[1:07:04] haven't i already proved my
[1:07:05] identification
[1:07:06] haven't i told you that i sent you for
[1:07:08] the job
[1:07:09] didn't i tell you to go do this
[1:07:12] didn't i promise that i'd speak through
[1:07:14] you didn't i promise that i'd show signs
[1:07:17] and wonders
[1:07:18] didn't i call you
[1:07:20] didn't i say it wasn't you it was me
[1:07:26] now make that personal
[1:07:29] all of those things could be applied to
[1:07:31] your own life if you will recognize
[1:07:35] that you have thus saith the lord
[1:07:39] he said then when any little thing comes
[1:07:40] up why you act like a baby you ought to
[1:07:42] be a man
[1:07:43] and brother brown said whatever it is if
[1:07:45] it's sickness
[1:07:46] if it's sickness
[1:07:48] or whatever it is
[1:07:50] whatever it is
[1:07:53] to raise the dead
[1:07:55] or whatever it is
[1:07:58] speak
[1:07:59] i've proved it
[1:08:01] speak to the people he said
[1:08:04] the church ought to be old enough to
[1:08:06] speak
[1:08:07] and he said but we don't know that you
[1:08:09] see
[1:08:10] we're still little babies
[1:08:12] with a bottle in our mouth
[1:08:15] see he said he said what this church
[1:08:17] ought to be
[1:08:18] this morning he went on to to explain
[1:08:21] all the things that we can observe to
[1:08:24] build to anoint our faith
[1:08:26] here is the world in this condition
[1:08:29] there's the nation in this condition
[1:08:32] there's the women in their condition
[1:08:35] there's the man in the condition i was
[1:08:37] telling the believers in mobile that
[1:08:39] that that brother brown and the message
[1:08:41] god this evil age he really hits on the
[1:08:43] women but in the message satan need
[1:08:46] satan's eden he hits on the men
[1:08:48] and one of the things he hits on was how
[1:08:50] men and women don't know who they are
[1:08:52] they they dress they cross dress and all
[1:08:54] that stuff and he said there is the
[1:08:57] church in the condition the church
[1:08:59] that's rejected the truth for their day
[1:09:02] and then he says
[1:09:03] there is
[1:09:05] everything
[1:09:06] now if you can look at all these
[1:09:08] evidences
[1:09:09] and observe no look at your own life
[1:09:12] look back at all the things that all the
[1:09:15] evidence is in your own life all the
[1:09:17] things the times that god has been with
[1:09:19] you
[1:09:20] and accumulate all those things together
[1:09:22] in your heart looking at the signs of
[1:09:24] the times that we're living in
[1:09:26] that should that should anoint your
[1:09:29] faith to know that you're anointed for
[1:09:31] the job that god has given you thus
[1:09:34] saith the lord and you're walking in it
[1:09:37] and see then brother branham begins to
[1:09:38] lay out all these examples in the
[1:09:40] scripture that david was anointed for a
[1:09:42] job when samuel poured that anointing on
[1:09:44] him he wasn't afraid to go faith goliath
[1:09:47] and he went with all of the accumulated
[1:09:50] experiences of fighting the lion and the
[1:09:52] bear that i know that that same god that
[1:09:56] delivered me from the lion and the bear
[1:09:57] that delivered those things into my hand
[1:09:59] he will deliver you goliath into my hand
[1:10:02] he went with all those experiences
[1:10:04] accumulated in his heart building up his
[1:10:07] faith
[1:10:08] and you see moses should have
[1:10:10] accumulated all those things and you and
[1:10:12] i should have accumulated all those
[1:10:13] things so that we know who we are that
[1:10:16] we're anointed for a job
[1:10:20] joshua was anointed for a job where the
[1:10:23] bible says there shall not any man be
[1:10:24] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:10:26] of thy life as i was with moses so i
[1:10:29] will be with thee i will not fail thee
[1:10:31] nor forsake thee and he had a job to do
[1:10:36] and that's that scripture that brother
[1:10:37] that brother brown the famous one the
[1:10:39] one that we think about in this sermon
[1:10:42] why christ speak that joshua in the hour
[1:10:45] of need
[1:10:46] knew that he was anointed for the job as
[1:10:49] he was fighting as the israelites were
[1:10:51] fighting the enemy and he saw the sun
[1:10:53] begin to set and he knew he knew that
[1:10:56] god had given him a job to destroy the
[1:10:59] enemy not to leave one standing but to
[1:11:01] utterly destroy the unit see god has
[1:11:04] given you a job to see the devil
[1:11:06] completely destroyed in your life
[1:11:08] completely pushed out
[1:11:11] and joshua had that shame thus saith the
[1:11:14] lord message that same commission to see
[1:11:17] the enemy destroyed and he saw the sun
[1:11:19] setting and he spoke he didn't have to
[1:11:22] go run and ask god permission because
[1:11:25] god had already given him thus saith the
[1:11:28] lord and he spoke it and he said let the
[1:11:32] he said son stands thou still upon god
[1:11:35] and thou moon and the valley of agilent
[1:11:38] and it did and he didn't maybe know why
[1:11:41] or how all he knew was that god had
[1:11:44] given him a commission and he he was so
[1:11:46] confident in that commission that god
[1:11:48] had raised him up for a purpose that he
[1:11:51] spoke it and it came to pass
[1:11:54] david had a job to do
[1:11:56] joshua had a job to do
[1:11:58] and moses had a job to do
[1:12:01] and you have a job to do
[1:12:03] you have a thus saith the lord
[1:12:05] commission
[1:12:06] to do your job
[1:12:09] brother abraham said samson was anointed
[1:12:11] he was raised up he was ordained of god
[1:12:14] given a gift of power and ordained to
[1:12:16] destroy the philistines and when he got
[1:12:19] surrounded one day he didn't say oh lord
[1:12:22] what should i do but he just reached
[1:12:24] down on the ground and found oh maybe
[1:12:26] crumbling up decaying jawbone of a
[1:12:28] donkey and he reached down because he
[1:12:30] had a thus saith the lord commission he
[1:12:33] didn't have to go beg and plead with god
[1:12:35] to find out what he was supposed to do
[1:12:37] but he grabbed that jawbone of an ass
[1:12:39] and he slew a thousand philistines
[1:12:43] you see we've got to have that kind of
[1:12:45] confidence in our commission you say
[1:12:47] well i'm not a brother brand i'm not a
[1:12:49] i'm not a big minister or something i'm
[1:12:51] not a big name
[1:12:52] listen
[1:12:54] you've got a commission just the same as
[1:12:56] any big person
[1:12:59] you might even be bigger
[1:13:02] brother brown said he never cried to god
[1:13:04] talking about samson he used his
[1:13:06] anointed gift he knew he was sent for
[1:13:09] the job
[1:13:10] he knew he was born for that
[1:13:13] do you see why mo well god brother brown
[1:13:15] spent so much time laying out how moses
[1:13:18] could look back and see the way he was
[1:13:20] born and the time he came he knew he was
[1:13:23] born for the thing for the job that he
[1:13:25] was going to take and see you can look
[1:13:27] at your birth your spiritual birth and
[1:13:30] know that you were born for a purpose
[1:13:33] he said he never asked nothing that was
[1:13:35] his job that god was dealing through him
[1:13:38] he didn't ask no questions he didn't cry
[1:13:40] out can i take the philistines lord he
[1:13:43] routed them nothing going to bother him
[1:13:45] he was anointed for the work he took
[1:13:47] what he had and beat into them
[1:13:50] and he said there is nothing can harm
[1:13:53] you
[1:13:54] there is nothing that can harm you that
[1:13:57] god doesn't allow god will allow
[1:13:59] sickness to come on you to bring you to
[1:14:01] a place but his word says that he's a
[1:14:04] healer his word says that he took upon
[1:14:07] himself all those beatings and stripes
[1:14:10] he took
[1:14:11] so that we could be healed
[1:14:15] y'all getting tired on me a little bit
[1:14:18] i'm trying i'm trying to come to a place
[1:14:19] where i can close
[1:14:21] but brother braham said if there ever
[1:14:23] was a time that man should speak
[1:14:25] now listen close now
[1:14:27] if there ever was a time that man should
[1:14:30] speak
[1:14:31] it's now
[1:14:32] and he said no more crying about your
[1:14:34] purpose
[1:14:36] what to do he said the bride
[1:14:39] has the background
[1:14:40] the bride has the background the
[1:14:42] accumulated anointing and he and he went
[1:14:45] through all these examples he said peter
[1:14:47] when he came to the great gate beautiful
[1:14:49] and he saw the man laying there laying
[1:14:51] on his feet he never went off to pray
[1:14:53] and asked god
[1:14:54] do you want me to to do this do you want
[1:14:57] me to tell this man that he he can be
[1:14:59] healed he he all he did was he said
[1:15:01] silver and gold i don't have any silver
[1:15:03] and gold but i'll tell you i got
[1:15:04] something
[1:15:05] and if you believe it you can rise up he
[1:15:08] said rise up and walk in the name of the
[1:15:10] lord and that man did and not because
[1:15:12] peter went off and worked something up
[1:15:14] but he had confidence in his commission
[1:15:17] he knew what he was predestinated to do
[1:15:19] he had a thus saith the lord commission
[1:15:22] jesus never cried when they brought him
[1:15:23] the maniac bored and said and said satan
[1:15:25] come out of him he never had to go cry
[1:15:27] and
[1:15:28] you know figure out if it was if it was
[1:15:31] god's will for that boy to be healed all
[1:15:33] he did was he said satan come out of him
[1:15:35] he never said now wait i'll kneel down
[1:15:38] here all of you kneel down and pray at
[1:15:39] the tomb of lazarus he never said now
[1:15:41] let's all get together and just pray a
[1:15:43] little bit so that i can figure out if
[1:15:44] that's if this is god's will he knew
[1:15:47] what god wanted he was god in flesh
[1:15:51] jesus at the grave of lazarus he said i
[1:15:52] am the resurrection and the life he knew
[1:15:54] he was the messiah and he just spoke
[1:15:57] lazarus come forth
[1:16:00] do you know that same voice is supposed
[1:16:02] to supposed to cry out in this day and
[1:16:04] all the dead saints will come forth from
[1:16:06] the graves that same voice
[1:16:10] brother braham said he knew his
[1:16:11] god-given rice
[1:16:13] but we don't he knew what he was
[1:16:16] we don't
[1:16:18] and he goes on he says moses forgot he
[1:16:20] needed to be a reminder we got all these
[1:16:23] promises in the bible of john 14 12
[1:16:25] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:16:27] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:16:31] shall he do also
[1:16:33] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:16:35] because i go under my father
[1:16:38] you know brother brown said that when
[1:16:40] when the bible speaks of when jesus said
[1:16:42] in john chapter 2 verse 19 destroy this
[1:16:45] temple
[1:16:46] and in three days i will raise it up
[1:16:49] brother raymond said the same scripture
[1:16:51] that said he would raise up his body
[1:16:54] give us the authority the power that
[1:16:56] same scripture that spoke of jesus is
[1:16:59] speaking of you because it says in my
[1:17:01] name they shall cast out devils they'll
[1:17:03] speak with new tongues if they take up
[1:17:05] serpents or drink deadly things it won't
[1:17:07] harm them if they lay their hands on the
[1:17:09] sick they shall recover
[1:17:11] that's a commission of thus saith the
[1:17:13] lord commission to you
[1:17:15] that if you will believe it and walk in
[1:17:17] it it will come to pass
[1:17:21] see i believe we're coming to a place
[1:17:23] where we don't need to go pray up for a
[1:17:25] while to find out if god really didn't
[1:17:28] mean what he said he said it any minute
[1:17:31] in matthew chapter 17 verse 20 it says
[1:17:34] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:17:35] unbelief for verily i say unto you if
[1:17:37] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[1:17:39] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[1:17:41] remove hints to yonder place and it
[1:17:43] shall remove and nothing shall be
[1:17:46] impossible unto you
[1:17:48] if you just have faith as a grain of
[1:17:50] mustard seed
[1:17:51] knowing your commission
[1:17:53] knowing where you stand
[1:17:55] knowing what god wants done with the
[1:17:57] word
[1:17:58] speak to the mountain
[1:18:00] and it shall be removed
[1:18:03] i i wonder tonight how many still regard
[1:18:06] that as just one of those scriptures
[1:18:09] i believe that even in our ears that
[1:18:11] scripture even in our sight that
[1:18:13] scripture is now beginning to become
[1:18:15] reality to us
[1:18:17] that now is the time when the sons of
[1:18:20] god will be made manifest i believe it's
[1:18:23] happening because it's been spoken
[1:18:25] brother brahma said in the rapture
[1:18:26] message he said the rapture has been
[1:18:27] spoken now let it come to pass and jesus
[1:18:30] spoke this word and it's now coming to
[1:18:33] pass
[1:18:34] he said in john chapter 15 verse 7 if
[1:18:36] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:18:39] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:18:42] shall be done unto you ye shall ask what
[1:18:45] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:18:47] not somebody just asking for a new car
[1:18:49] or something but somebody asking in
[1:18:51] faith
[1:18:52] based upon the word
[1:18:54] based upon the correct revelation and
[1:18:57] understanding of the word
[1:18:59] and that will give you power and
[1:19:01] authority to speak it
[1:19:03] and you because you realize
[1:19:05] that you have that you have confidence
[1:19:08] in the word because it's been
[1:19:10] accumulated in you it's been built up to
[1:19:12] a place
[1:19:13] where now
[1:19:15] you have confidence in the word and god
[1:19:17] has confidence in you
[1:19:20] brother brown said why cry to me the
[1:19:22] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[1:19:23] i'm i'm coming to a closing place why
[1:19:26] are you crying to me when i proved to be
[1:19:28] with you
[1:19:28] haven't i healed your sick he'd say
[1:19:30] haven't i told you things that happened
[1:19:32] just exactly
[1:19:34] your pastor can't do that
[1:19:36] now i love this quote because it sounds
[1:19:39] so similar to the quote in looking to
[1:19:42] the unseen
[1:19:43] what god actually speaks through brother
[1:19:45] branham this quote is almost a verbatim
[1:19:48] quote to that if you will go back and
[1:19:50] listen to that
[1:19:51] and how he says i'm the one that gave
[1:19:53] the promise in looking to the unseen and
[1:19:55] he says brother brown has nothing to do
[1:19:57] with this with this i'm speaking through
[1:19:59] him now listen to this as i just read
[1:20:00] this in closing he said he can't he's a
[1:20:02] man it's me the lord that he would say
[1:20:05] i'm the one that did this
[1:20:07] i'm the one that tells him these things
[1:20:09] to say
[1:20:10] it's not him it's my voice
[1:20:13] i'm the one that raises up your dead
[1:20:15] when they drop down
[1:20:16] i'm the one that heals the sick i'm the
[1:20:19] one that foretells these things
[1:20:21] i'm the one that does the saying saving
[1:20:25] i'm the one that give the promise
[1:20:27] you see brothers and sisters i don't
[1:20:29] believe that we've heard a message just
[1:20:31] from a man but i believe that was god
[1:20:34] speaking to us confirming his word to us
[1:20:37] confirming the commission
[1:20:39] confirming your personal commission
[1:20:42] you believe that tonight
[1:20:44] well let's just stand and worship the
[1:20:46] lord
