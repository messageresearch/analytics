[39:50] Jesus name
[39:52] amen so we'll go to Revelations 1 first
[39:56] then we'll go to Hebrews 1 and
[40:01] uh so Revelations 1 we've been reading
[40:04] for a while it says the revelation of
[40:06] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now
[40:10] who gave the Revelation amen we're not
[40:13] trinitarians we're not this that or the
[40:15] other we're we're just you know doing
[40:18] the best we can to understand the word
[40:20] right but this was the Revelation all
[40:22] right the revelation of Jesus Christ
[40:24] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[40:26] son servants things which must shortly
[40:28] come to
[40:29] pass and he sent and signified it by his
[40:32] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[40:35] record of the word of God and of the
[40:37] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[40:38] things that he saw blessed is he that
[40:41] readeth and they that hear the words of
[40:43] this prophecy and keep those things
[40:46] which are written therein for the time
[40:48] is at hand now what is the time at the
[40:50] hand the prophet of God we covered it
[40:52] where he said when the word is revealed
[40:57] you know the time is at hand when the
[40:59] word is made known all right now let's
[41:01] go to to Hebrews
[41:13] one Hebrews 1 verse 13 and
[41:19] 14 but to which of the Angels said he at
[41:21] any time sit on my right hand till I
[41:24] make thine enemies thy foot to
[41:27] he's talking about the Angels now what
[41:29] are they not all ministering Spirits
[41:31] sent forth to minister for them who
[41:33] shall be hirs of Salvation and that's
[41:36] what angels are sent for right okay now
[41:39] we go to Matthew
[41:41] 4 then we'll go to Psalms either way you
[41:44] we go to Matthew 4 and then we read it
[41:46] in
[41:47] Psalms Matthew
[41:50] 4:1 now I'm just getting a point
[41:55] here to where we can get to it after
[41:58] what verse 11 said then the devil
[42:01] leaveth him now you remember he's out in
[42:03] the Temptation in the wilderness and the
[42:05] things that's taking place you know the
[42:07] tempting of the Lord Jesus and he said
[42:09] and then the Lev devil leaveth him and
[42:12] behold Angels Came and ministered unto
[42:16] him amen Angels Came and ministered to
[42:19] the Lord Jesus all right and we read
[42:21] that they Minister into the hours of
[42:23] Salvation right all right so now let's
[42:26] go to Psalms
[42:30] 34 and we'll Express more about it in a
[42:33] moment but you'll notice always that the
[42:36] biggest percentage of the time brother
[42:38] Brandon will say Angels plural right the
[42:41] scripture says Angel see the angel of
[42:44] the Lord encampeth round about them that
[42:46] fear him and
[42:51] deliverthat he's telling you what it is
[42:55] it takes all of the Angels right to make
[43:00] that angel amen all right so he's
[43:03] correcting what he say in the angels of
[43:05] God you may be seated Lord at his
[43:07] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[43:08] you can see all we got laying up here
[43:10] that we got a bunch you know for
[43:13] everybody to
[43:15] uh to read on so if if you don't
[43:19] understand what I'm saying at least you
[43:22] can read what the prophet had to say and
[43:24] that's the way I love it because
[43:26] I that's where I get what I preach on
[43:28] and what I what I see and and we see one
[43:31] more back there the sister came in so we
[43:34] I guess you heard the announcement we
[43:36] always say sister that when you come
[43:38] you're just one of us you know so make
[43:40] yourself at home man
[43:43] now I spoke
[43:46] back before the first of the year
[43:48] somewhere in there on a message and I
[43:51] said I would get back to it because it
[43:53] was a hard thing to understand
[43:57] and uh so I want to go back over that
[44:00] and make sure you understand but the
[44:02] foundation for this message was uh back
[44:05] when I was preaching and I I titled it
[44:07] then Angelic
[44:10] beings and that was the title back a few
[44:13] months ago and know and uh so I want to
[44:17] continue I want to make sure you
[44:19] understand what I'm
[44:20] saying now whether you believe it or not
[44:22] I can't I can't reveal it and whether
[44:25] you believe it or not is up to you and
[44:28] you know if you don't believe it fine
[44:30] just uh just tell me you don't believe
[44:32] it that's that's all right but uh you
[44:34] know let's see what the prophet had to
[44:36] say and I've never tried to convince
[44:38] anybody I just try to speak what I
[44:41] believe and that way then people can uh
[44:45] hear and have an opportunity and we get
[44:48] a good B bit of response back from
[44:51] people reading one just there moment ago
[44:54] and and uh you you know it I I I
[44:57] appreciate the response back and I
[45:00] appreciate you talking to me and telling
[45:02] me whether or not you agree cuz I want
[45:04] you to tell me not go tell everybody
[45:06] else you know you go tell everybody else
[45:09] you don't agree with me and then still
[45:10] come here you got a problem and then all
[45:13] it'll do just create a problem with me
[45:14] come just tell me I don't agree with you
[45:17] that's no problem my wife tells me that
[45:18] a lot of times
[45:20] you I don't agree with you about that
[45:23] that's all right she's got her opinion
[45:25] I'm not one that beats her over the head
[45:27] with it you know and uh you know she
[45:31] allows me to run things around the house
[45:33] like the vacuum cleaner and the washing
[45:34] machine and stuff like that anyway I
[45:36] mean you know so that's that's all right
[45:39] that's just a joke you know it's just a
[45:43] point you know that I want her to have
[45:46] her Holy Ghost and her
[45:50] Revelation all right I believe in the
[45:52] sisters having a revelation just as well
[45:54] as the brothers and you're sisters
[45:56] you're not going in the Rapture just
[45:58] because your husband goes this is not a
[46:01] package deal if your husband goes and
[46:03] you get ride on his back no that's not
[46:06] it it's it's it's got to be revealed to
[46:08] you you know and you got to have just
[46:11] whether the children and everything
[46:12] you've got to have your own Holy Ghost
[46:14] you got to have your own Revelation all
[46:16] right so then uh we just leave it that
[46:18] way
[46:19] now as I said I I wanted to to cover
[46:24] some things and to to make sure you
[46:27] understand I was just talking a little
[46:29] bit while they were getting to the
[46:30] things you know uh give out and all like
[46:33] that but now see the the main a couple
[46:37] of main things I want you to listen
[46:40] to is brother random said on the rising
[46:43] of the sun there number one on your
[46:44] notes that the same word that spoke of
[46:47] the
[46:49] groom speaks of the
[46:51] bride all right same word speak speak of
[46:56] the groom speaks of the bride all right
[46:59] so if we want to find ourselves we don't
[47:01] have to isolate
[47:02] scriptures that would talk see and and
[47:05] we think that we would really enjoy that
[47:07] but you know it that must just be about
[47:10] Jesus you know but the scriptures that
[47:13] spoke of him speak of us the speak that
[47:16] speak of us speaks of him why because
[47:18] it's him in us what we've been there in
[47:20] Revelations 1 as we were trying to cover
[47:23] you know Revelation one there where at
[47:25] 13 and all where it's one standing in
[47:28] the midst of the seven golden
[47:29] candlesticks like unto the son of man G
[47:31] about the PS with a golden girdle and
[47:34] the prophet said that's the bride all
[47:36] right so then that's just we say well
[47:39] that's the bride now now it's Christ in
[47:41] the bride right you know what he's
[47:42] saying that's right see we we nothing
[47:45] without
[47:47] him if he's not in
[47:49] us we're nothing anyway that's just the
[47:52] way it goes all right but
[47:54] now
[47:57] see if it speaks of him then we can put
[48:00] ourselves there now like what I've tried
[48:01] to tell you about the Book of Revelation
[48:03] if you want to find yourself in the
[48:05] Bible read the book of Revelation the
[48:07] book that everybody was told to stay
[48:10] away from the book that the devil
[48:13] doesn't want you to read to see yourself
[48:16] amen because show me in the Book of
[48:19] Revelation where Jesus Christ is ever
[48:21] standing by
[48:24] himself we haven't got down to it yet to
[48:27] where we get to it but you say well what
[48:28] about the lamb well that L lamb had
[48:31] seven horns and seven eyes and your
[48:32] Prophet said the lamb came from the
[48:34] church ages so we got to get into a lot
[48:37] to understand that all right you say
[48:39] well what about Revelations 10:1 you
[48:41] know that would be Christ we agreed all
[48:44] right but brother BR said it was the
[48:46] same as Revelations
[48:49] 1113 now we're right back where we
[48:51] started at that you can see Christ in
[48:54] the Book of Revelations
[48:56] cuz the prophet said if you don't see
[48:58] Christ in every verse go back and read
[49:00] it again all right now so that's the
[49:03] point that that we're getting at now I
[49:06] gave you one there on number two on the
[49:08] number is why Christ speak
[49:12] uh where brother brand says that and he
[49:15] uses the word
[49:17] us see we we read it to where it says
[49:21] you know uh that it bu thee up cuz that
[49:23] was Jesus on the the Temptation we were
[49:25] reading right down below there in
[49:26] Matthew a moment ago and and he said the
[49:29] angel the devil told an angel to Bear
[49:31] thee up L you dash your foot against the
[49:32] stone you know well brother random says
[49:36] he'll bear us
[49:39] up us up Les we do the same thing you
[49:44] know L we Dash our foot against the soul
[49:46] well now those are the things I want you
[49:48] to uh see and then verse number three
[49:51] there see not air with a
[49:52] shook the word to be fulfilled in this
[49:55] day
[49:57] is what we're dealing with amen now to
[50:00] be fulfilled in this day right all right
[50:02] then we are the people that are the
[50:04] Living Word of the
[50:06] Day of where we're at right all right
[50:09] we're the manifestation upon Earth of of
[50:12] the Lord Jesus Christ and brother randam
[50:14] said if these people talk about oil in
[50:17] their for you know on the forehead blood
[50:20] in their hands or whatever you know back
[50:21] and forth said they're not realizing
[50:24] that they're saying that the Corporal
[50:26] body is here and he said that's contrary
[50:29] to scripture he said cuz we meet the
[50:31] Corporal body in the are so then it's
[50:34] going to have to be in you and me to be
[50:38] here see all right now it's going to be
[50:40] fulfilled in this day all right now as I
[50:43] said I preached on this back a while ago
[50:46] and I'm still on it and
[50:49] U we were talking about the angel that
[50:53] come to John on patas
[50:56] and and a lot of people of the message
[50:58] is beginning to get stronger and
[50:59] stronger that they are saying that that
[51:02] was brother Bram that come to John on
[51:06] patmas now uh you got two or three
[51:09] different problems there with trying to
[51:12] understand that and I'm not contrary to
[51:14] nobody I just preach here what I believe
[51:16] all right if they want to listen that's
[51:17] fine but and if you differ that's fine
[51:21] but I know brother randam was a prophet
[51:23] and I know the quotes brother random
[51:25] said that it was a prophet that come to
[51:27] John O Batman I I know that I know what
[51:30] he's saying and I I know for certain but
[51:32] be careful because see you would have
[51:35] pre-existence right cuz brother brandham
[51:37] was born here in our day about 199 or
[51:40] somewhere and see you're saying that he
[51:42] was back there with John right well you
[51:45] know I mean really uh at least and and I
[51:50] don't throw off on nobody but I I don't
[51:53] believe that people are literally
[51:54] because I don't believe we're that dumb
[51:56] people but maybe we are but I don't
[51:59] believe that people are literally
[52:01] believing that brother brandom actually
[52:03] come and stood there in a human body
[52:06] right they're trying to explain
[52:08] something right and and all right but I
[52:13] see that and like I've told you brother
[52:15] random was waiting for the mighty one to
[52:17] come right you got to divide his
[52:20] ministry for three and A2 I mean for the
[52:23] the uh uh 30 something years that he was
[52:26] preaching and trying to get us back to
[52:27] the faith of the fathers and his message
[52:29] didn't begin until the seals
[52:31] broke so he was waiting on that mighty
[52:34] one to come would it me that mighty one
[52:36] was the one that come to John on
[52:39] Pat cuz the mighty one would be the
[52:43] prophet he brother R was a prophet a son
[52:46] of man but the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[52:50] prophet and by coming down in the way
[52:52] that he came to appear to John to bring
[52:56] these things to him then it would be you
[52:59] know that he would be it would be the
[53:02] prophetic Ministry that you're dealing
[53:05] with not the human flesh I I don't think
[53:08] most of people believe that the human
[53:09] flesh surely don't believe that that the
[53:12] human flesh would stand there with John
[53:13] on patmas because you got pre-existence
[53:16] is you got a lot of things that are are
[53:18] are messing
[53:20] up but see I I believe that that angel
[53:23] was the
[53:26] Prophet okay now then that would include
[53:29] every
[53:30] Prophet you know all right and see if
[53:34] it's not going to change whether we're
[53:36] going to go into Rapture or not what we
[53:37] believe about the but the main thing is
[53:39] to believe whether or not God came to
[53:41] him that's been my point my Point's not
[53:44] whether or not that was brother brandom
[53:45] it come to John I want to
[53:48] know
[53:50] what that angel told brother Brandon
[53:53] right right now I want to know what that
[53:57] is see all right because see what
[54:01] greater honor could we give to brother
[54:03] brandom see people would say well
[54:05] brother Dale you're degrading brother
[54:06] brandom because you don't believe that
[54:07] he was the one no no I'm just leaving it
[54:11] alone and letting it go because what's
[54:13] the greatest
[54:15] honor for me to know that he come to
[54:18] John and stood over there with him
[54:19] physically whatever would that change me
[54:22] but
[54:23] whatever the that brother random told me
[54:27] and you
[54:31] right some people think that this
[54:33] brother Brandon was transferred over
[54:35] there in spirit real and things it's all
[54:37] right my point is what did he say come
[54:41] on I want to know what the angel of the
[54:45] Lord said to me right behold I send you
[54:49] Elijah the Prophet come
[54:52] on see I I want to know that it's not
[54:55] what you know whether Somebody went here
[54:57] or somebody went over
[54:59] there it's it's kind of like Wade and I
[55:01] were talking about it one day and you
[55:03] got problems see because what what are
[55:05] you going to do with brother brandham
[55:06] when he was preaching that the white
[55:08] horse rider was the Holy Ghost now that
[55:12] can't be take taken to John on patmas
[55:14] cuz it wasn't
[55:18] true you you you better get it in the
[55:21] correct line right and like I'm saying
[55:24] I'm not arguing with nobody there no
[55:26] problems I'm just stating to my people
[55:28] what I believe that I want to know what
[55:31] God told brother
[55:32] Brandon because I've been through it and
[55:34] shown you that even though the angel as
[55:37] we read a moment ago come to John on
[55:40] patas dur in Revelations
[55:43] 1 all right but you know that angel
[55:46] couldn't reveal a thing to John he could
[55:49] tell John
[55:51] right right he could announce it right
[55:54] but he couldn't reveal it right brother
[55:56] Ram can't reveal anything to you amen
[55:59] I've got the quotes in here where
[56:00] brother Ram said it he said the Holy
[56:02] Ghost is the only revealer of the word
[56:04] right we see then once you're trying to
[56:06] make things and you know see I've just
[56:09] tried to make myself
[56:11] clear see I believe the most important
[56:14] thing is not who it was that came to
[56:18] John but who was it that come to brother
[56:22] brandom that's
[56:23] right because if you're going to say
[56:27] that that he did tell John you got to
[56:29] back up to find out who was that told G
[56:32] brother Bram to go tell John so then I
[56:34] want to talk to that
[56:36] person I want to know that deal you know
[56:39] amen because only the Holy Ghost can
[56:42] reveal the word amen go see like I said
[56:45] there in the Book of Revelations in in
[56:47] chapter one see when the angel come to
[56:51] John and told John that didn't end it
[56:54] the the Lord Jesus came on the scene in
[56:56] chapter one read your Bible that's right
[56:59] he came on the scene
[57:02] there well if he don't come on the scene
[57:04] in our hearts and loud what does it
[57:05] matter who tells us what that's right
[57:08] amen that's
[57:10] right almighty God stood on Earth and
[57:12] told a lot of things but what did that
[57:15] do to people that's right did that
[57:17] convert one person while he was here no
[57:19] no no I never converted one person while
[57:23] he's on Earthen
[57:25] you know what I'm saying he never gave
[57:27] the new birth to nobody cuz he couldn't
[57:28] give the new birth cuz he hadn't died
[57:31] yet it was inside of him amen all right
[57:34] that's all I've been trying to to get
[57:36] you to see about it but we'll get over
[57:37] in a minute and and jump off but see in
[57:41] the Book of Revelation you
[57:43] see the key to all of the Bible like I
[57:46] said to about uh in Genesis with
[57:52] Moses god came on the scene right and
[57:57] went down and delivered the children of
[58:00] Israel right
[58:02] righten now Moses couldn't do that right
[58:07] the one that said I'll go with you amen
[58:10] and said my angel will go with you and
[58:12] said you better fear him because my name
[58:14] is in him well evidently that must have
[58:17] been Jesus Christ now not Jesus the
[58:20] Flesh on that's right brother BR said
[58:24] the Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[58:26] Christ it's not the revelation of Jesus
[58:28] it's not the revelation of Christ that's
[58:30] right amen cuz you'd be a Oneness when
[58:33] you run those channels that's right but
[58:35] when he said it's the revelation of
[58:36] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is
[58:39] almighty God
[58:41] Amen so then we're dealing with the full
[58:43] revelation of the
[58:51] Bible you're putting something on other
[58:54] words if you looking at brother Brandon
[58:55] being there you're putting something on
[58:57] to some kind of a thing you can nail
[58:59] down instead of listening to what he's
[59:01] saying amen that's
[59:04] right instead of believing that see and
[59:07] I know it's it's around the country you
[59:09] know and everybody's doing it well
[59:10] that's all right I'm just I just tell
[59:12] you what I believe amen I have no
[59:14] problems with these others that want to
[59:16] believe anything do you want to believe
[59:17] your big toes God that's all right just
[59:20] don't expect me to worship it that's
[59:23] right bless
[59:25] that's that's just the way I am I'm
[59:27] plain I'm too old to not be see the
[59:31] entire Bible then be the Revelation
[59:33] Jesus
[59:35] Christ number three a on your notes now
[59:37] as you remember A's come in here when I
[59:39] add
[59:40] notes you looking at number three and
[59:43] then you look at
[59:44] 3A okay and what he bre around and say
[59:48] the Holy Ghost is the only revealer amen
[59:53] of the word amen
[59:55] right now Jesus brother R I can give you
[59:57] that word brother said Jesus said my own
[1:00:01] life did not reveal that unto thee amen
[1:00:04] that's right so the father's got to
[1:00:05] reveal that's right amen all right who
[1:00:08] are we depending upon for the Revelation
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] right somebody can come and make things
[1:00:14] know thank God right that's
[1:00:16] right thank God for the making known to
[1:00:19] us right you
[1:00:22] know I'm glad they made a
[1:00:25] an a
[1:00:27] model you know what somebody made that
[1:00:30] known one day but I sure don't want it
[1:00:33] brother D's got one and he he loves to
[1:00:35] ride in it that's fine I'll ride with
[1:00:37] him but I'm not going to New York in a
[1:00:43] sucker I'm just not going to do it I'll
[1:00:46] fly he
[1:00:48] drive but now
[1:00:51] listen get to point now and we'll get on
[1:00:53] to what we're talking about
[1:00:55] all
[1:00:56] right see we read in Hebrews 1 and 13-
[1:01:00] 14 especially verse
[1:01:02] 14 that the angels of God are given
[1:01:06] right to minister unto the ARs of
[1:01:10] Salvation amen thank you angels are not
[1:01:12] giving everybody right right I know they
[1:01:16] got the beautiful pictures and they got
[1:01:18] all these things and if you'll notice
[1:01:19] 90% of is women and I don't agree with
[1:01:23] that you know and they got Gloria
[1:01:25] setting it to now when you put out your
[1:01:28] little little scene at Christmas you
[1:01:29] know and you get everybody there and
[1:01:31] then they set this little Gloria down
[1:01:33] this little female angel you know cuz
[1:01:35] they're getting that all in the mind of
[1:01:37] the kids where when the kids grow up
[1:01:39] they well they was an angel
[1:01:42] there could that have been the angel
[1:01:44] that announced us that he was to be born
[1:01:46] over there you know you know you believe
[1:01:50] what you want to I'm not trying to
[1:01:51] destroy the kids' little thoughts it's
[1:01:55] adults I'm dealing
[1:01:56] with not
[1:01:58] kids that's right but you
[1:02:01] see then what are we trying to
[1:02:04] do there's no
[1:02:06] school no scholar no man r r says how
[1:02:11] well educated or guard or anything else
[1:02:13] he can't teach you anything that's right
[1:02:15] sir it takes a holy ghost so that's the
[1:02:18] main thing I want is the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:20] I ain't worried about the rest of it cuz
[1:02:22] he'll reveal it right as long as I wait
[1:02:24] on them all right now see only the
[1:02:28] redeemed have
[1:02:30] angels I like I said we see the pictures
[1:02:33] and we see a little kid leaning over a
[1:02:35] thing you know and we see this Angel and
[1:02:38] it's hovering over you know that's all
[1:02:40] well and good that's all right um people
[1:02:43] write books and they say uh I won't call
[1:02:46] it but anyhow one big man wrote a book
[1:02:49] and they had had a child that died real
[1:02:51] young like a little girl I think it was
[1:02:53] and they wrote a a book about
[1:02:56] angels you know well I think that my
[1:02:59] grandkids are angels I think my great
[1:03:01] grandchild is Angels but it's like I've
[1:03:04] always told you they're Halos held up by
[1:03:07] horns right you know my kids are
[1:03:10] angels they're H they're held up by
[1:03:13] horns my wife don't have no
[1:03:15] horns she's wore them off on pushing me
[1:03:18] around trying to keep me
[1:03:20] straight but now are you understanding I
[1:03:24] say them things that just get you to
[1:03:25] click away from something else cuz it
[1:03:28] you know you get to thinking on the
[1:03:29] wrong thing all right now brother random
[1:03:32] says everyone now he gave that was 1950
[1:03:36] uh
[1:03:37] 1964 um on questions and
[1:03:41] answers number four on your notes where
[1:03:43] he says now it isn't promised that
[1:03:45] Sinners has Angels it's only the
[1:03:47] redeemed have Angels see because the
[1:03:50] scripture says that they're to minister
[1:03:52] into the hours of salvation that's right
[1:03:54] all right now he goes on in 1953 on the
[1:03:57] resurrection I don't think he was wrong
[1:03:59] I believe he was right and he says it
[1:04:01] this way God always sends his warning
[1:04:04] just before the coming of Jesus he sent
[1:04:05] an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name
[1:04:07] of Gabriel now minor Angels come my yes
[1:04:10] you see Angels everyone has a guardian
[1:04:13] angel according to the scripture see
[1:04:16] Jesus said their Angels always behold my
[1:04:19] father's face which is in heaven now
[1:04:21] that's what I say I don't believe
[1:04:22] everybody's got Angels you can say well
[1:04:24] I believe they're farther little
[1:04:25] children and things so you like to make
[1:04:27] things fit uh I i' rather this deal with
[1:04:30] the Bible and and just say you know that
[1:04:33] the redeemed have Angels well that angel
[1:04:36] that you have your Prophet said come to
[1:04:38] you his angel came to him when he was
[1:04:41] born there in that cabin and it was a
[1:04:43] light
[1:04:45] right it was a light that came in the
[1:04:48] room amen and it was the angel of the
[1:04:50] Lord he said and finally he met that
[1:04:53] angel of the Lord
[1:04:55] and I've got it in there I gave them to
[1:04:56] you the other day the prophet said the
[1:04:58] reason we don't see Angels is we're not
[1:04:59] dedicated enough he said when I see the
[1:05:02] angel of the Lord now this is your
[1:05:03] Prophet quot it he said when I see the
[1:05:05] angel of the Lord is when I'm fasting
[1:05:07] and
[1:05:08] praying see because there there's a
[1:05:10] supernatural realm there that you you
[1:05:13] you you know you got to do now I want to
[1:05:15] say this and then I'll repeat it and
[1:05:17] repeat it and repeat
[1:05:19] it I've even got quotes in here well
[1:05:21] that's the next one on down but
[1:05:24] see a lot of people says well you know
[1:05:27] uh the angels of the
[1:05:30] Lord they say I just the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost well right now I going to say this
[1:05:37] and then we'll read what your Prophet
[1:05:39] said let's see if it fits in there see
[1:05:41] then there's all kind of forms of angels
[1:05:45] right all right and we'll get to it as
[1:05:48] we go through it we've been through it
[1:05:51] there are
[1:05:53] angels and brother Ram called his Angel
[1:05:55] a minor Angel that's up to him now you
[1:05:58] know what he called him one time I'll
[1:05:59] give it to you a while he called him the
[1:06:02] one with the healing right y he called
[1:06:06] it the healing Angel yep cuz there's
[1:06:08] angels for everything you know
[1:06:10] wormwood you know if God needed water to
[1:06:12] destroy the world you know he'd get wor
[1:06:14] wormwood cuz he destroyed it first time
[1:06:15] there's Angels assigned to those things
[1:06:19] and may not be used but one time right
[1:06:22] well you know they're not offended
[1:06:25] no we was listening last night where
[1:06:27] brother Brown was talking about the
[1:06:28] brother that kind of got offended at at
[1:06:30] what he had said to him one day you know
[1:06:32] and he just fell over dead well he went
[1:06:34] down and be like a lot of us were
[1:06:35] blessed God let him lay there call The
[1:06:38] Undertaker yeah he went against me no he
[1:06:42] goes down and prays for him God raises
[1:06:44] him up well I heard later the man got
[1:06:46] offended and says that that didn't
[1:06:48] happen exactly like that that's his
[1:06:49] business that ain't
[1:06:51] mine ain't nothing to me that's right
[1:06:55] but you see there's
[1:06:57] Angels because in the beginning that was
[1:07:00] the first thing that's what made him God
[1:07:02] right he created angels and they worship
[1:07:04] we think he probably created four you
[1:07:05] know oh when I'll brother day make more
[1:07:08] okay
[1:07:09] six I can name you more of that out of
[1:07:11] the Bible right
[1:07:14] y but you see he created a large amount
[1:07:18] of angels amen and assigned them with
[1:07:21] the things that they would be each one
[1:07:24] dealing with we'll get to it in a minute
[1:07:27] amen but then it goes
[1:07:30] upward and he calls it degrees we'll
[1:07:33] read that in a minute sure he calls it
[1:07:36] levels see sure you got
[1:07:40] angels and then you got Earthly Angels
[1:07:43] which are Church age Messengers and
[1:07:45] preachers are angels and you're an angel
[1:07:47] to your to someone you're trying to
[1:07:51] help and then there's
[1:07:55] judgment
[1:07:57] Angels then there cherubims yes there
[1:08:01] seraphim there's archangels Y and Jesus
[1:08:04] is even the angel of the Covenant
[1:08:08] right so there's
[1:08:11] Angels the prophet said one day we'll
[1:08:13] look and they'll be right here around us
[1:08:15] and we'll see them that's right he said
[1:08:17] that's what he said he said reason we
[1:08:19] don't see him is we don't dedicate
[1:08:22] ourselves that's what he said now
[1:08:24] quoting him he said when that angel
[1:08:26] comes to me is when I'm fasting and
[1:08:28] praying if you like that quote I'll be
[1:08:30] glad to get it for
[1:08:32] you but now listen look down on the next
[1:08:36] one it's obeying the voice of an Angel
[1:08:39] 1950 there's a lot on these but I just
[1:08:41] chose one to bring back to
[1:08:43] us someone said not long ago said to me
[1:08:46] said brother randam Angels was
[1:08:48] ministering spirits in the Old Testament
[1:08:51] oh my now look
[1:08:54] but since the Holy Spirit has come we
[1:08:57] don't have ministering Angels
[1:09:00] anymore now that's what people believe
[1:09:06] right all right now what did he
[1:09:09] say he talks about now this is not you
[1:09:12] know this is not worship of angels and
[1:09:14] things he's talking about angels being
[1:09:16] ministers to the church going down to
[1:09:17] the next paragraph and see you it's in
[1:09:20] the same message on the next paragraph
[1:09:22] said you think of Mary when he Gable Now
[1:09:24] watch how close brother brandom will be
[1:09:28] because when he asked you asked you
[1:09:30] asked a prophet a question remember it's
[1:09:32] God answering the question right right
[1:09:35] if he really yields himself so look how
[1:09:37] close he was well you think of Mary when
[1:09:40] Gabriel came down oh wait a minute
[1:09:42] brother randam got you there cuz Mary
[1:09:45] was still in the Old Testament cuz the
[1:09:46] New Testament had come into being
[1:09:49] yet look how close he makes it well
[1:09:52] think of Mary when Gabriel came down and
[1:09:55] spoke to her about the Virgin birth of
[1:09:57] the Savior are Zachariah in the temple
[1:09:59] that's still under the Old
[1:10:01] Testament are well now watching see he
[1:10:05] catches it and he knows somebody's
[1:10:08] listening he says or well after the Holy
[1:10:11] Ghost come now he moves into the New
[1:10:14] Testament room and many he believes that
[1:10:16] Philip had the Holy Ghost well we all
[1:10:18] believe that don't we well when he was
[1:10:20] down at
[1:10:21] Samaria preaching having a Revival was
[1:10:25] it the holy ghost that came to him or
[1:10:27] did the angel of the Lord touch him and
[1:10:29] say go to the desert
[1:10:32] Gosa the angel of the Lord came to him
[1:10:35] is that true it was the angel of the
[1:10:37] Lord that came to him
[1:10:39] right well everyone would believe that
[1:10:41] great St Peter the Apostle had the Holy
[1:10:43] Ghost he had the keys to the kingdom and
[1:10:46] he had the Holy Spirit didn't he but but
[1:10:49] when he was in jail one night and in
[1:10:52] prison and down at John Mark's house
[1:10:55] they were having a prayer meeting it was
[1:10:57] the angel of the Lord who came in and
[1:10:58] touched him and led not the Holy Ghost
[1:11:01] the angel of the Lord came in
[1:11:03] right right okay are you listening to
[1:11:06] what he's saying now right like I said
[1:11:09] now there's Angels there's Angels
[1:11:10] there's Angels there's
[1:11:13] angels and each one has an assigned
[1:11:16] thing to
[1:11:17] do so it wasn't the holy ghost that just
[1:11:20] up in the jail now when not an angel
[1:11:23] come down
[1:11:26] amen right amen but see we don't believe
[1:11:29] they're real we think it's just well
[1:11:31] brother the reason people say it they
[1:11:33] don't see Angels
[1:11:35] right
[1:11:38] huh you know here in America we have a
[1:11:40] saying of if I can't see it I don't what
[1:11:42] is that Missouri if I can't see it I
[1:11:45] don't believe
[1:11:47] it old man at work you know was talking
[1:11:49] about brother Mo was talking to him and
[1:11:51] tell you about that he was you know he
[1:11:53] said why they didn't go up in to the
[1:11:55] Moon they just went out there in the
[1:11:57] desert and sat down
[1:11:59] somewhere well if they able to fly up
[1:12:01] and go out in the desert to be fly
[1:12:03] somewhere else but see that was his
[1:12:05] point you couldn't convince him you
[1:12:07] can't convince people that they're
[1:12:08] Angels amen well cuz they never seen
[1:12:13] one and never seen one you don't believe
[1:12:16] it you believe in Pink
[1:12:19] Elephants no Brother D but a lot of you
[1:12:21] got drunk and believed in them
[1:12:24] yeah
[1:12:25] right you know some of you life and some
[1:12:28] don't cuz I don't guess you saw pink
[1:12:29] elephants when you was drunk but what
[1:12:31] else did you
[1:12:32] see blue
[1:12:36] ones no but you
[1:12:41] see there are angels
[1:12:45] here amen that's
[1:12:47] right they're right here in the building
[1:12:50] with us the prophet said your eyes will
[1:12:51] open one day am and you'll see see it
[1:12:54] amen right you see those angels are real
[1:12:57] they're not just a thought of your
[1:12:59] imagination right you
[1:13:03] no watch him now as he gets over look
[1:13:06] over on
[1:13:08] 68 obey the voice of the Angel 1950 we
[1:13:11] know Paul had the Holy Ghost you believe
[1:13:13] that well when he was 14 days and nights
[1:13:15] upon the sea without any moon or stars
[1:13:18] and it was all dark and he went down
[1:13:20] into Galley to pray he went back and
[1:13:23] told the men be of good courage for the
[1:13:26] angel of God whose servant I am came to
[1:13:30] me last night and said Fe not Paul is
[1:13:33] that right not the Holy Spirit the angel
[1:13:36] of the Lord see an angel of God sent
[1:13:38] from God
[1:13:41] right look at it and then John the
[1:13:44] Revelator the whole book of Revelations
[1:13:46] when it was wrote he said I have sent my
[1:13:48] angel Jesus did and John fell down to
[1:13:52] worship the Angel and the Ang angel said
[1:13:53] stand up worship God see a true angel of
[1:13:56] God won't stand to be
[1:13:59] worshiped he said that he was of the
[1:14:01] prophets and was and was his fellow men
[1:14:04] that had been sent to signify these
[1:14:07] things therefore Angelic beings is
[1:14:08] ordained ministers of God to come to the
[1:14:11] Earth and bu record of God and they work
[1:14:14] through mortal
[1:14:16] beings y just as they did through Daniel
[1:14:19] and back through the ages there I
[1:14:22] believe it with all my heart is said
[1:14:25] all Angel of the Lord
[1:14:27] 1951 I want you to know that that that
[1:14:30] that angel of God is no more to do with
[1:14:32] me than it is to do with
[1:14:36] you he's talking about his Angel having
[1:14:38] something to do with
[1:14:42] us why because he's bringing the message
[1:14:44] to him to bring to us right
[1:14:49] right that is an angel sent down from
[1:14:51] heaven and if you don't believe angels
[1:14:54] are ministering spirits in the presence
[1:14:55] of God then you don't know the Bible yes
[1:14:58] sir someone said brother brandom angels
[1:15:01] as far the Old Testament why that's an
[1:15:03] era the new church had more Angels
[1:15:06] ministering than what the Old Testament
[1:15:09] did yes sir well you said the Holy Ghost
[1:15:13] leads the church that's the correct
[1:15:16] that's correct the Holy Ghost is over
[1:15:20] all now how many angels could you name
[1:15:23] coming up see Angels this angel that
[1:15:26] angel this angel that angel this and the
[1:15:28] Holy Spirit is ruling all of it
[1:15:32] right the holy spirit is the one that's
[1:15:34] in charge
[1:15:36] amen they're all under his supervision
[1:15:43] right see it's like he'd say
[1:15:45] justification to work of the holy spirit
[1:15:47] all right so you can say that the an
[1:15:49] angel brother Rand will call that angel
[1:15:51] that come to him the pillar of Fire
[1:15:53] right he'll call that angel that come to
[1:15:56] him Christ he'll call that angel that
[1:15:58] come to him a
[1:16:00] man but when we get down here in a
[1:16:02] minute he'll tell you the difference in
[1:16:03] it right we've read them to you
[1:16:11] that where are we
[1:16:15] at okay we'll going down to seven cuz
[1:16:18] we're in that we're read let's back up
[1:16:20] to that paragraph well he they said the
[1:16:22] Holy Ghost leads church that's correct
[1:16:23] the Holy Ghost is overall this is the
[1:16:26] body and it's true but there's also
[1:16:29] ministering Spirit sent from the
[1:16:30] presence of God we know that Mary and
[1:16:32] all those they seen angels and we know
[1:16:35] the new church seen
[1:16:37] Angels how about you say Do you believe
[1:16:40] Philip had the Holy Ghost Philip the
[1:16:41] Evangelist after the Pentecost he had
[1:16:43] the Holy Ghost didn't he but who was it
[1:16:46] told him to go to the desert Gaza the
[1:16:49] angel of the Lord came down is that
[1:16:50] right when he was having that Revival at
[1:16:53] Samaria Peter had the Holy Ghost you
[1:16:55] believe that and while they were having
[1:16:58] a prayer meeting for him at John Mark's
[1:17:00] house the angel of the Lord what was it
[1:17:02] a light shine in the window and the
[1:17:05] angel of the Lord touched him and
[1:17:07] dropped the Shackled off of him and put
[1:17:09] him outside of the building is that
[1:17:10] right and Peter had the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:12] that right in other words what's he
[1:17:14] saying this what I always say what did
[1:17:16] the Holy Ghost do
[1:17:19] it he got somebody assigned right amen
[1:17:23] y see I'm trying to make things real
[1:17:26] here on Earth we get over there then you
[1:17:28] can look back at it and say well brother
[1:17:30] Dale tried his best to tell me about
[1:17:31] this cuz I can see real
[1:17:33] things but see it takes somebody that's
[1:17:35] seen something to be able to talk to you
[1:17:37] about what they've seen so you know and
[1:17:39] I don't care to discuss that
[1:17:42] anymore Paul had the Holy Ghost you
[1:17:44] believe that whose servant I am all
[1:17:50] right going up to 78
[1:17:54] I just keep my numbers right still in
[1:17:57] the angel of the Lord there another
[1:17:59] another message I think this uh e41 the
[1:18:02] whole book of Revelation was showed to
[1:18:04] John by an Angel I have sent my angel to
[1:18:06] testify that right so angels are
[1:18:08] ministering Spirits usually come in the
[1:18:09] form of lights and I truly personally as
[1:18:13] I started to say a while ago with my
[1:18:15] Bible over my heart I believe that the
[1:18:17] angel of God I've seen it since I was a
[1:18:20] little
[1:18:20] boy in that little cabin they told me he
[1:18:24] came come in and that came come in that
[1:18:29] you seen the picture that the lady draw
[1:18:32] last night of the little cabin where I
[1:18:33] was born he said now that won't make me
[1:18:36] any different right go on down obey the
[1:18:39] voice of the Angel these are these are
[1:18:41] two it would be good for you to listen
[1:18:44] to but God's gift is the holy
[1:18:48] spirit that came down in the form of an
[1:18:52] Angel
[1:18:58] now who would have told brother brandham
[1:19:00] about those things
[1:19:03] right why would he stand there and say
[1:19:05] and this is a man who had the Holy Ghost
[1:19:08] right this is a man that we believe at
[1:19:11] least in the 63 when the seals were
[1:19:14] broke that he would be coming to his
[1:19:16] adoption stage amen yes and the man
[1:19:18] stands there and says you know what I'm
[1:19:20] doing I'm waiting on him right amen y he
[1:19:23] calls it the angel of the Lord he calls
[1:19:25] it Christ he calls it the Holy Ghost he
[1:19:26] call it
[1:19:28] all
[1:19:30] right that's what confuses people y well
[1:19:33] what will come to
[1:19:36] it you go and get into that seal book
[1:19:39] sometimes and you get to listen and you
[1:19:40] keep you compare what happened and
[1:19:42] here's brother brandham sitting in a
[1:19:44] room now he tells you is nothing in the
[1:19:47] room y right but him in his Bible right
[1:19:51] right and yet he's writing notes off of
[1:19:54] uh Fox's book of
[1:19:57] martyr he's writing notes and brings it
[1:19:59] out off of of the uh what is it the
[1:20:03] predan
[1:20:04] fathers and you get sometimes and just
[1:20:07] run it through and check it all out and
[1:20:09] see what is all in that
[1:20:11] room he said the angel of the Lord was
[1:20:13] in the room the Holy Ghost was in the
[1:20:15] room right he just keeps naming
[1:20:18] different things that was in the room
[1:20:19] it's probably pretty crowded yeah
[1:20:24] I make I say that where you life and you
[1:20:26] life you know you'll remember that if
[1:20:29] you didn't life you wouldn't remember it
[1:20:31] so you remember what I'm saying I know
[1:20:33] what to do with things I make you make
[1:20:34] you think about something amen right see
[1:20:38] it wouldn't crowded in the
[1:20:40] room I'm just getting a point to you
[1:20:42] what all was
[1:20:44] there all right but listen what he
[1:20:47] says look down on to the next one obey
[1:20:50] his voice 1957113 paragraph or e13 and
[1:20:53] therefore friends as your brother that's
[1:20:56] all I am but God's gift is the spirit of
[1:20:59] God that came down in the form of an
[1:21:01] angel now he didn't have
[1:21:04] wings he looked like a
[1:21:06] man I heard him when he walked brother
[1:21:09] around illustration you just as that and
[1:21:14] walked on the floor and walked right
[1:21:15] over just as normal as any man and talks
[1:21:20] just like any man amen he comes time
[1:21:23] after time through the room and
[1:21:24] different places when I'm fasting and
[1:21:27] praying
[1:21:31] amen now listen to what he says
[1:21:34] expectations 19581 E6 number eight on
[1:21:38] your
[1:21:39] notes someone told me here not long ago
[1:21:42] said brother random said now why don't
[1:21:44] you give all the praise to the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost and say that that's the Holy
[1:21:48] Spirit let's give praise to the Holy
[1:21:51] Spirit say that's the Holy Spirit I said
[1:21:53] my
[1:21:55] brother I must be
[1:21:57] truthful whether it's a holy spirit I
[1:22:00] said it's a gift sent from God that's
[1:22:04] right now I wish we'd bear on to that
[1:22:06] you know heavily right he calls it a
[1:22:09] gift up above there in that other
[1:22:11] message now he calls it a gift again
[1:22:13] right sent from God he never said he was
[1:22:16] the Holy Spirit never told me who he was
[1:22:20] that's what everybody who is he find out
[1:22:22] is
[1:22:23] name now you know that person name
[1:22:25] interesed in a thing in the world that's
[1:22:28] right what good does it matter what his
[1:22:31] name
[1:22:32] is but see I don't know his
[1:22:35] name now you done cut off your computer
[1:22:37] you know what I mean your brain's gone
[1:22:39] that's right you ain't
[1:22:43] listening listen to what he said
[1:22:46] amen he never said he was the Holy
[1:22:48] Spirit never told me who he was he said
[1:22:50] I'm sent from the presence of God and it
[1:22:53] does not feel like the Holy Spirit when
[1:22:55] it comes
[1:22:57] okay the holy spirit makes me feel
[1:23:01] happy but when that comes around it it
[1:23:05] isn't that feeling it's very sacred
[1:23:09] August feeling like and it's different
[1:23:13] but it's sent from God Amen that's
[1:23:16] it
[1:23:18] now is he degraded in the Holy Ghost he
[1:23:20] said it's not the Holy Spirit but he
[1:23:22] said this is an August presence
[1:23:25] right he said the holy spirit makes me
[1:23:28] feel happy
[1:23:30] yep but then he describes this angel
[1:23:33] coming to him as like
[1:23:34] a a wonderful
[1:23:38] feeling listen he said brother randam
[1:23:41] the ministry of angels that was back in
[1:23:42] the Old Testament like Daniel and so
[1:23:44] forth but that's an error friends that
[1:23:46] that that that is wrong now he said
[1:23:48] since the Holy Ghost come and the Holy
[1:23:50] Ghost leads the church that's what
[1:23:51] people say we don't need the Angels the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost lead that's the truth the
[1:23:55] Holy Ghost leads the church but holy
[1:23:58] ghost leads the church that is true but
[1:24:00] there's ministering Spirit sent from God
[1:24:02] special gifts friends y That's it
[1:24:06] special gifts all right what's a
[1:24:09] preacher a gift is that according to
[1:24:12] Ephesians what's a prophet a gift that
[1:24:15] according
[1:24:17] to
[1:24:19] right what's all those other things
[1:24:21] speaking in tongues
[1:24:23] now look what he called it in the
[1:24:25] message I am the resurrection 19521
[1:24:28] 1810 God still has angels and they visit
[1:24:31] the people not a worship of angels but
[1:24:34] Angelic beings who are attributes of God
[1:24:38] am amen sent to Min sent forth to
[1:24:41] minister to the church through the
[1:24:43] people oh my how short we are are the
[1:24:45] real Apostolic Church going down to the
[1:24:47] bottom and you'll see it's in the same
[1:24:50] thing and pick up that one right in the
[1:24:52] middle notice this angel came he was
[1:24:55] Gabriel and God sends minor Angels
[1:24:58] that's right perhaps the one that comes
[1:25:00] one that comes
[1:25:04] here now I tell you what so now Mr
[1:25:10] Brandon you call me a minor Angel again
[1:25:12] I'll zap
[1:25:17] you now that's what we think the angel
[1:25:21] of the Lord would say
[1:25:26] right well who are you well I'm
[1:25:30] I'm you know just a minister at
[1:25:33] Lula I'm not just a minister I'm the
[1:25:36] pastor oh
[1:25:40] my now what's wrong right now do you
[1:25:43] think that angel of God was offended for
[1:25:47] brother random to call him a minor Angel
[1:25:49] that's not the only time I give you a
[1:25:51] lot of quotes before on it right right
[1:25:52] right
[1:25:54] amen no he's tickled to death amen he's
[1:25:57] in his place right like I've told you
[1:25:59] why didn't that angel tell brother
[1:26:01] randam what the seals were he told him
[1:26:03] about the the other things he told him
[1:26:05] about Daniel 70 weeks he told him about
[1:26:07] the the serpent seed he told him about
[1:26:09] the many things of the Bible why didn't
[1:26:11] he tell him what the seals were that's
[1:26:14] right he didn't know what it
[1:26:17] was he wasn't assigned to that job right
[1:26:21] amen

[1:26:26] God all right take it here's
[1:26:29] God take it and let it come down in your
[1:26:31] mind here's

[1:26:39] Christ not another God that's right the
[1:26:43] Son of God the Creator the
[1:26:45] Loos here's sarapes here's

[1:27:07] right right
[1:27:10] amen where did the prophet say we get in
[1:27:13] trouble trying to take each other's
[1:27:15] place he said you businessmen stay out
[1:27:19] of the pull pit it's not your job
[1:27:23] J right what you
[1:27:27] see all right what do we
[1:27:32] got he said perhaps the ones that comes
[1:27:35] here some people will actually watch now
[1:27:37] puff their mind up with angels and
[1:27:40] things right all right who they think
[1:27:44] they have seen and things like that
[1:27:46] that's just the counterfeit
[1:27:50] right well brother D you you told us
[1:27:52] what you've seen that's up to you to
[1:27:54] figure out where it's counterfeit or not
[1:27:56] cuz you ain't got but one way to know
[1:27:58] that's right that's whether or not you
[1:28:01] got the Holy Ghost is going to be the
[1:28:02] only one could tell you
[1:28:04] anything that's right if you got the
[1:28:07] Holy Ghost it'll take care we'll come on
[1:28:08] down through here in a minute we got it
[1:28:09] lined up to where that if a minister
[1:28:12] don't stay with the word he ain't an
[1:28:13] angel sent from
[1:28:15] God he sent from somewhere outse and if
[1:28:19] he's all puffed up about angel I seen an
[1:28:21] angel seen an angel here you got to
[1:28:23] believe me cuz I seen an angel yeah M no
[1:28:27] no that's right you got your own why
[1:28:29] don't you talk to
[1:28:32] him come on you you you quote what the
[1:28:36] prophets why throw the not down there
[1:28:38] today people just take them and and
[1:28:40] stumble all over what you give them the
[1:28:42] prophet of God said all redeemed have
[1:28:44] Angels you have an angel a guardian
[1:28:46] angel that goes with you why don't you
[1:28:48] try to contact that one
[1:28:51] sometimes right but why the prophet say
[1:28:54] he said because we're not fasting and
[1:28:55] praying enough right brother Dale you
[1:28:59] tell us about
[1:29:01] it no you're supposed to have an well I
[1:29:04] got the Holy
[1:29:06] Ghost well if you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:29:08] got an angel you're not going to get
[1:29:09] upset about what I say then amen you
[1:29:12] won't get offended right if you got the
[1:29:15] Holy Ghost don't worry about
[1:29:17] it look he's still in the same message
[1:29:20] he said if it ain't if a if a man has
[1:29:23] seen an angel and met his commissioned
[1:29:27] or that angel commissioned him from God
[1:29:30] and it was sent from God it'll bear a
[1:29:34] record right down to the line right that
[1:29:37] it's the truth you believe that but if
[1:29:39] it doesn't it isn't the truth that's one
[1:29:42] thing you can depend on by their fruits
[1:29:44] you shall know
[1:29:46] them he said well brother Dale
[1:29:49] what come to you
[1:29:52] see I always nip things in the
[1:29:55] bud it was said that brother Dale met
[1:29:59] the same angel that brother R met in his
[1:30:01] study no
[1:30:02] sir I've got my own Angel that's right I
[1:30:07] don't have brother
[1:30:09] Brams man stood here years ago and
[1:30:11] preached that he said I talk to brother
[1:30:12] bram's Angel every
[1:30:18] day pre it right
[1:30:20] here years ago I again I don't believe
[1:30:24] it right I'm not concerned about brother
[1:30:27] Brown's angel I'm concerned about the
[1:30:28] Holy Spirit leading me and keeping me
[1:30:30] straight it's the Holy Spirit doing it
[1:30:32] but I still have an angel right you have
[1:30:35] an angel right that's the point I'm
[1:30:37] trying to make right you're trying to
[1:30:40] find out where mine is don't find out
[1:30:42] about me it won't put you in the Rapture
[1:30:44] and no where brother Dale's at that's
[1:30:46] right it'll only do for you when you
[1:30:49] know where you're at amen amen I believe
[1:30:52] brother so and so man I believe him now
[1:30:54] the Lord really well that's all right
[1:30:55] but what's God dealing with you come on
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] amen remember you're not going in the
[1:31:01] Rapture because brother Dale or Lev or
[1:31:03] anybody is going
[1:31:06] right I use them names called it Ryme
[1:31:08] not for degrading
[1:31:12] nobody you got to have your own Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost right if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:31:18] you got an angel come on that's right
[1:31:22] you know it ought do us all good to do a
[1:31:23] little fasting and praying we might find
[1:31:25] out a lot of
[1:31:27] things
[1:31:28] right but you see now all right get on
[1:31:32] with it brother D on
[1:31:34] hush greatest battle ever fought number
[1:31:37] 10 on your notes Here the Bible comes
[1:31:40] right back and tells us here that God
[1:31:42] sends forth Angels Glory what are they
[1:31:44] ministering Spirits Glory ministering
[1:31:46] experience s work right from the
[1:31:48] presence of God what to do Minister his
[1:31:51] word right right I'm
[1:31:54] listen see amen you're not to minister
[1:31:57] some theology or of some denominational
[1:32:00] group but to minister his word that's it
[1:32:03] ministering Spirit sent
[1:32:05] forth how do we know they are now how do
[1:32:09] you know whether or
[1:32:11] not that someone has made contact with
[1:32:15] an angel and that angel has talked to
[1:32:17] him
[1:32:20] right I see you stop there and then you
[1:32:22] start
[1:32:23] backpedaling why don't you try to find
[1:32:26] your angel and talk to him that's
[1:32:29] right you want to talk to
[1:32:32] mine don't do you no
[1:32:36] good find your
[1:32:38] own you don't try to believe brother
[1:32:41] Dale the only one got the holy ghost or
[1:32:42] we'll just believe he got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:44] and that makes us with the Holy Ghost go
[1:32:45] we believe he's got the Holy
[1:32:47] Ghost something wrong with your
[1:32:49] mentality am that's
[1:32:53] right but you see you said well it's not
[1:32:56] brother Dale I've got a quote brother
[1:32:58] but not meant for everybody I agree with
[1:32:59] you that's right CU it's degreed in the
[1:33:02] body of
[1:33:03] Christ but ministering Spirits how do
[1:33:05] you know how do you know whether or not
[1:33:08] I'm have made contact with god let's
[1:33:11] just read
[1:33:14] it how do we know they
[1:33:17] are the Bible said that the word of the
[1:33:20] Lord came to the prophet
[1:33:22] right all right we believe the prophets
[1:33:23] don't
[1:33:26] we but is that all of it I thought we
[1:33:29] believe there was a five4 Ministry
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:33] amen these angels
[1:33:37] Ministry his word through his Spirit
[1:33:40] ministers the word through the Holy
[1:33:42] Spirit and the Holy Spirit and the word
[1:33:44] comes to the prophet and the prophets
[1:33:46] had the word of God that's the reason
[1:33:48] they could do the Miracles that they did
[1:33:50] it wasn't the man it was the spirit of
[1:33:52] God in the man the spirit of Christ in
[1:33:54] the man for the word all right now
[1:33:56] that's brother random we believe in
[1:33:58] that we believe he was a church age
[1:34:01] messenger don't we we believe he was an
[1:34:02] angel of God don't
[1:34:04] we the reason we believe it because he
[1:34:06] brought the
[1:34:09] word now I know people don't like for
[1:34:12] you to make plain statements but you
[1:34:14] know why I believe brother BR was a
[1:34:17] prophet now there's people here that saw
[1:34:20] him and saw all the dead raised the sick
[1:34:22] healed and things like that and
[1:34:23] wonderful I believe them but you know
[1:34:25] why I believe
[1:34:27] it cuz it Compares with what's inside of
[1:34:31] me right well who are you I'm me who are
[1:34:34] you what' that
[1:34:39] solve how are you going to know whether
[1:34:41] a prophet's right or not that's right
[1:34:43] that's right it's only by the word amen
[1:34:46] and it's the word that's in you
[1:34:48] right you know how I I check preacher
[1:34:51] when they're preaching you know what
[1:34:53] I've told
[1:34:54] you this what been with me ever since I
[1:34:56] started in this message you know how I
[1:34:58] check preachers to see where they're
[1:34:59] writing the word or not I don't set well
[1:35:02] he quoted that wrong he missed the A out
[1:35:03] of that message he missed a be
[1:35:06] here no I sat there and listened to what
[1:35:09] the person is saying right and then I
[1:35:11] see if it fits the new birth right that
[1:35:15] I have within me that's right amen and I
[1:35:18] let the Holy Spirit decide that's right
[1:35:20] well brother d what if you're wrong well
[1:35:22] if if I'm wrong I'm
[1:35:23] wrong but the Holy Ghost is not wrong
[1:35:27] that's
[1:35:28] right see going down reading the
[1:35:31] greatest battle Hur yes sir these are
[1:35:33] ministering Spirits sent from the
[1:35:34] presence of God to be ministers to
[1:35:36] minister what his word not some theology
[1:35:39] but God's word their ministering Spirit
[1:35:41] sent forth from God to minister
[1:35:43] ministering Spirits oh and remember if
[1:35:45] it's ministering something besides the
[1:35:47] word it don't didn't come from God
[1:35:49] because Thy word is all always confirmed
[1:35:52] in heaven always in heaven go on down he
[1:35:55] will never send a spirit and with a
[1:35:56] great big DDD now you know what he
[1:35:59] saiding there great big thing and his
[1:36:01] collar turned around in the back and
[1:36:03] everything like that well of course the
[1:36:05] days of Miracles is
[1:36:07] passed Big D D D see we all know that no
[1:36:13] no that didn't come from God right it's
[1:36:17] contrary to his word amen he sends the
[1:36:20] ones that ministers the Spirit of the
[1:36:22] word amen he said he wish he had a whole
[1:36:24] lot to go on that one
[1:36:27] now so then what are
[1:36:30] they there's your personal
[1:36:33] angel that comes to
[1:36:35] you that is not the Holy Spirit right
[1:36:39] but is governed or ruled by the holy
[1:36:41] spirit amen or the holy spirit is in
[1:36:44] full charge if it come from
[1:36:47] God now you can claim to see this and
[1:36:49] see that and believe this and believe in
[1:36:51] voices believe all kind of things but if
[1:36:53] it don't compare with the word amen well
[1:36:56] who are you well like a man told us one
[1:37:00] time when he said we don't have brother
[1:37:02] brandom here I said but we got his
[1:37:05] message
[1:37:07] amen what's wrong we got his message
[1:37:11] amen well you can quote and I can quote
[1:37:14] well let's put them all
[1:37:17] together what's the
[1:37:20] problem
[1:37:22] let's get it all together but you see
[1:37:25] then there's like I said there's angels
[1:37:27] to each individual being that's a new
[1:37:29] got a new birth and that angel like
[1:37:30] brother Brown said he said it come in
[1:37:32] that building in that house there where
[1:37:35] he was born that a light you said well
[1:37:38] that's just the Holy Ghost he said I
[1:37:40] read you the quote where he said the
[1:37:41] angel come
[1:37:42] there do you believe it
[1:37:45] yes he's the one that said it we ain't
[1:37:48] talking about
[1:37:49] ourselves so when you're born an angel
[1:37:51] come to you amen now if you want to tie
[1:37:54] anything together you want to tie your
[1:37:56] representation and predestination right
[1:37:58] there amen that's right but we want to
[1:38:00] make it well bless God I come in the
[1:38:02] world with eternal life yeah right well
[1:38:04] look what I am I've had eternal life all
[1:38:06] my what a garbage can standing in the
[1:38:09] front of me looking like amen and acting
[1:38:12] like
[1:38:15] amen that's right that angel came when
[1:38:19] you was born too yep
[1:38:22] and was with you all your life if you
[1:38:24] have the new birth
[1:38:25] today God his only father redeemed only
[1:38:29] the redeemed have the new birth that's
[1:38:31] right and he's going to take care of us
[1:38:33] L we Dash our foot against a stone now
[1:38:36] I'm re quoting the quotes I gave you
[1:38:39] right right the points that we gave
[1:38:42] right so then there's what there's
[1:38:45] angels and then there's Church age
[1:38:47] Messengers there's
[1:38:50] ministers
[1:38:52] we'll get to it in a minute we don't
[1:38:53] have time I know but we'll get to this
[1:38:55] part at least but what's the
[1:38:58] next well I don't believe these flying
[1:39:00] saucers flying
[1:39:03] around that's just garbage well your
[1:39:07] brother random that you claim to be a
[1:39:08] prophet he surely did believe in
[1:39:12] it and he called him investigating
[1:39:15] Angels now we won't have time to read
[1:39:17] them so we'll take these up Wednesday
[1:39:19] but you just take these notes home we
[1:39:21] can bring them back Wednesday we won't
[1:39:22] have to rerun all these Pages please
[1:39:26] because you'll find in there if you'll
[1:39:27] read them you'll find brother random
[1:39:29] said that there are special beings
[1:39:31] special persons ones assigned to a
[1:39:35] special job read the notes and then
[1:39:38] we'll preach on it
[1:39:41] Wednesday

[1:39:45] investigating
[1:39:50] angels five Junctions at the time numers
[1:39:53] 12 on your
[1:39:54] notes
[1:39:57] 5622 he said the whole worlds and
[1:39:59] shaking I go into Germany or what will
[1:40:01] we do I go into India what we going to
[1:40:03] do I go into Switzerland everywhere what
[1:40:05] are we going to do what about now amen
[1:40:08] the whole world is shaking the United
[1:40:10] States is shaking the great bureaus and
[1:40:13] so forth in the great Pentagon and all
[1:40:15] that investigating Supernatural things
[1:40:18] flying saucers what are they oh they say
[1:40:22] we seen little men in them all kind of
[1:40:25] stories they try to deny it but they
[1:40:29] there
[1:40:30] why God said that there'd be signs in
[1:40:32] the heavens above and in the earth we
[1:40:35] got it they're
[1:40:37] afraid all right now he believed in
[1:40:41] investigating Angels flying
[1:40:48] saucers what you see
[1:40:51] a supernatural thing is taking place
[1:40:54] investigating
[1:40:56] judgment right flying saucers now I like
[1:40:59] to put this in too where you can do it
[1:41:01] so you know you get flying saucers
[1:41:03] running around and they've been knowing
[1:41:04] for many many many many many
[1:41:07] years that they've been flying
[1:41:09] around so what's the best thing the
[1:41:12] United States and Russia can
[1:41:14] do they got steals bombers now that are
[1:41:17] totally invisible to Radars and things
[1:41:24] and Francis powers in
[1:41:26] 1962 called a you two pilot was shot
[1:41:29] down by the Russians that plane was
[1:41:33] faster and more
[1:41:35] sophisticated than the steals bombers
[1:41:38] they used last year year a couple years
[1:41:40] ago when they went into
[1:41:43] Kuwait that's what your government
[1:41:46] people
[1:41:47] says so brother brandom I'll quote you
[1:41:50] him
[1:41:51] he said Russia had Jed airplanes that's
[1:41:54] 50 something well we know that cuz they
[1:41:56] were they captured high for the German
[1:41:58] scientist we got half of them the wall
[1:42:00] of Berlin we know
[1:42:03] that Adam Bomb had done been split the
[1:42:05] things were taking
[1:42:07] place all right but he said they got fly
[1:42:10] got jet airplanes and flying saucer just
[1:42:13] run flying saucers in your computer and
[1:42:15] you'll find brother around and tell you
[1:42:16] Russia had flying saucers 50
[1:42:19] something
[1:42:21] why because it was already running
[1:42:22] around in the sky that God was doing
[1:42:24] these things and what's the easiest way
[1:42:26] Brother Gary to check on another country
[1:42:28] take you a couple of little bitty guys
[1:42:30] that's a little bit small or something
[1:42:31] pull her ears up and piek them and
[1:42:33] operate on them just in case they
[1:42:35] fall you make them look
[1:42:38] funny paint them green or
[1:42:42] something and wind up and put them in an
[1:42:45] airplane it's invisible The Radars and
[1:42:49] things and they just fly around this
[1:42:51] file well don't you think we're doing
[1:42:53] the same thing folks we're not goody two
[1:42:55] shoes here in
[1:42:57] America that's
[1:42:59] right they had watches in
[1:43:03] 1900 when we're still thinking and I am
[1:43:06] to of the old thing you got to throw
[1:43:08] over your head and look up through it
[1:43:09] you know and the thing blows off and
[1:43:11] here you take a picture they had watches
[1:43:14] in the 1900 that would take pictures of
[1:43:19] individuals
[1:43:22] we ain't playing
[1:43:24] around they're investigating each other
[1:43:27] here why because now they can they say
[1:43:30] well we don't know what's going on
[1:43:32] because here goes this and here goes
[1:43:33] that
[1:43:34] see but your Prophet believe right along
[1:43:37] in the middle of all that that God had
[1:43:39] investigating Angels wouldn't the two of
[1:43:41] them sit down to Sodom didn't he call
[1:43:43] them matter what all right you say well
[1:43:45] I don't know let's keep reading then
[1:43:47] what about the Christ of mystery of God
[1:43:49] revealed not 63 728 number 13 did you
[1:43:53] notice the angels that come down
[1:43:55] investigated Sodom before Sodom was
[1:43:58] destroyed you remember that there was a
[1:44:00] bunch of them come down three of them
[1:44:02] one of them stayed with Abraham and you
[1:44:04] remember that they were lights from
[1:44:06] Heaven that came down in the
[1:44:08] investigating judgment
[1:44:12] right and look where they're all
[1:44:16] found around the Pentagon and thing
[1:44:21] that they find them that's the whole
[1:44:23] world judgment
[1:44:25] Sodom look at the next one and knoweth
[1:44:28] it not 65 813 just in case people think
[1:44:31] he CH well that's in his early Ministry
[1:44:33] so we give you a couple I seals you
[1:44:36] know the world don't know what that is
[1:44:39] you know you know it's all in we know
[1:44:43] what it is see we know it's
[1:44:45] investigating judgment Angels you see
[1:44:48] and they how that the Pentagon
[1:44:51] all about how it comes right down to the
[1:44:53] intelligence and that they go like a
[1:44:55] Flash and be gone pull away from
[1:44:58] anything they got see and they don't
[1:45:00] realize what it is see let them think
[1:45:03] whatever they want to they call them
[1:45:05] flying saucers or whatever they don't
[1:45:09] know blind
[1:45:11] saucers we won't be able to get into the
[1:45:14] next cuz that's when get into angels and
[1:45:17] burners and shims and things but we'll
[1:45:20] do that Lord willing Wednesday am but
[1:45:22] just keep in mind what we're talking
[1:45:25] about please keep these notes cuz we
[1:45:27] won't have to run some many that's right
[1:45:30] me and that old printer get fighting
[1:45:31] each other all the time anyway and he
[1:45:34] wants to do it his
[1:45:36] way I think sometimes there's got to be
[1:45:38] an investigating bug in there
[1:45:41] somewhere but listen do you understand
[1:45:44] what I'm trying to do I'm not trying to
[1:45:46] show you the quotes brother Ram says
[1:45:48] come on right thoughts the ideas no I'm
[1:45:51] trying to get you and I to realize one
[1:45:54] thing the angels of God are
[1:45:57] real believe they're real and one day
[1:46:00] we'll see
[1:46:02] them we may not see them here because we
[1:46:05] may not do as the prophet said we may
[1:46:07] not get ourselves out of the
[1:46:09] way there are
[1:46:11] people right here Among Us that seen
[1:46:14] things they talk to me about
[1:46:18] them why because if you get yourself out
[1:46:21] of the
[1:46:22] way God will speak to
[1:46:25] you what would be the difference in him
[1:46:27] sending why didn't he go down to Peter
[1:46:29] in jail why didn't the Holy Spirit just
[1:46:31] go down and the shackles fall and the
[1:46:33] gates open and what no he had an angel
[1:46:36] signed for that
[1:46:39] right said go do
[1:46:43] it
[1:46:45] wormwood an angel was
[1:46:49] assigned he you remember what brother
[1:46:51] randam
[1:46:53] said he said when they got ready to go
[1:46:55] down he said there are the children of
[1:46:57] Israel I'm the the three Hebrew children
[1:46:59] would being thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:47:00] in a different different ways he
[1:47:02] explains it and he
[1:47:05] said warm wood comes up and said let me
[1:47:07] just wash it off I'll put that fire out
[1:47:10] he said you've been good but he said I'm
[1:47:12] going myself
[1:47:14] yep Gabriel came said let me do it he
[1:47:18] said you've been good Michael even
[1:47:22] came he said let me go he said no I'm
[1:47:25] going
[1:47:27] myself see there's angels and there's
[1:47:32] Angels sure there's angels that are
[1:47:35] anointing Us in the wrong direction
[1:47:39] too
[1:47:41] right because they're Fallen
[1:47:46] Angels if Satan could enter into and
[1:47:49] speak speak to the Lord Jesus and try to
[1:47:53] get him to
[1:47:56] reason what do you think's happening in
[1:47:58] your mind in my mind a lot of
[1:48:00] time Angels trying to enter into
[1:48:04] us what made the man the demon the man
[1:48:08] there with the G
[1:48:09] Gia wor it the
[1:48:11] swine right what made him like he was
[1:48:16] right but said he didn't start out wrong
[1:48:18] he was a good man right but he let
[1:48:20] something get inside of him and
[1:48:23] Captivate him and said when he did he
[1:48:27] said then Jesus cast that demon out of
[1:48:29] him what was that demon
[1:48:32] y would that demon be an angel or the
[1:48:41] devil what comes and sometimes tells you
[1:48:43] something I had something one time came
[1:48:45] to me and started and I was writing
[1:48:47] notes and wrote five
[1:48:49] pages
[1:48:52] and in a minute something spoke inside
[1:48:54] of me and said if you do that you make
[1:48:57] your type greater than your
[1:48:59] antitype and that's all he
[1:49:02] said he didn't say you're wrong he
[1:49:05] didn't say nothing or explain it he just
[1:49:08] said you make your type greater than
[1:49:10] your
[1:49:11] antitype I took those notes and not only
[1:49:14] tore them up I burn them cuz I would not
[1:49:17] want no one to ever know what was on
[1:49:19] those notes
[1:49:21] and I could have proved it by the
[1:49:22] prophet's message in the Bible but the
[1:49:25] way I was approaching it was wrong
[1:49:30] right I don't mind being honest with you
[1:49:34] see you're going down the highway and
[1:49:36] somebody runs you off the road and
[1:49:38] something rils up in you who is that now
[1:49:41] come on I know it can be
[1:49:43] you I don't blame the devil for
[1:49:46] everything now don't do that that's
[1:49:47] don't do it we was listening last night
[1:49:49] I don't know what the name of the
[1:49:50] tapwood we were listening last night and
[1:49:52] brother random was explaining about
[1:49:54] these family that that they were Germans
[1:49:57] and he said they would stand and said
[1:49:58] you walk by in the morning said I'd go
[1:50:00] by and speak and say good morning said
[1:50:01] just look at
[1:50:03] me he said I good
[1:50:06] morning just look at
[1:50:10] you he said because it's their ways now
[1:50:13] he said these were Holy Ghost filled
[1:50:16] people
[1:50:18] right do you think no that brother Dale
[1:50:20] Holy Ghost fi people don't act that way
[1:50:22] Holy Ghost fil people ought not act that
[1:50:25] way but I'll sure get you to take and
[1:50:28] let you listen to the prophet explain
[1:50:29] how that because of their German
[1:50:33] background that they would be hard and
[1:50:35] Stern and and things and he said it's
[1:50:39] hard to deal with
[1:50:41] them am you know what that is that's a
[1:50:45] German
[1:50:46] Spirit
[1:50:48] right what kind we got
[1:50:55] I've always wondered what M background
[1:50:57] was and I decided not to go look it up
[1:50:59] cuz I might find out the wrong
[1:51:01] thing I told you what they' done one
[1:51:03] time they run it back to see if we would
[1:51:05] can find any you know maybe hanging by
[1:51:08] the tail to be in our family and they
[1:51:10] found out a bunch of them hung by the
[1:51:11] neck so we decided to
[1:51:15] quit that's not a
[1:51:18] joke don't think how goody two shoes you
[1:51:21] are folks
[1:51:24] right we ain't nothing but a messed up
[1:51:27] bunch of concoction instead of
[1:51:29] caucasians you don't know what your
[1:51:31] background is and you know that all of
[1:51:33] that motivates you that's
[1:51:36] right cuz all that Spirits there's a
[1:51:38] German Spirit there's an American Spirit
[1:51:41] ours is
[1:51:46] laughter but it's
