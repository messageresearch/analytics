[16:52] evening I'm going to go right to the
[16:54] word of the Lord this
[16:56] evening I'm going to read from the book
[16:58] of genes
[16:59] Genesis in the Book of Genesis the 3r
[17:02] chapter and the 16th
[17:06] verse and I and I so much easier to read
[17:10] it then it is here he says and uh unto
[17:14] the woman he said I will greatly
[17:16] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[17:18] and sorrow th shall bring forth
[17:20] children's and thy desire shall be to
[17:23] thy husband and he shall rule over thee
[17:29] let us go to Ephesians
[17:31] 5 God bless you
[17:34] Soldier yeah praise the Lord let me see
[17:37] Ephesians 5 and I want to begin reading
[17:40] at verse
[17:41] 21 and it reads like this it says submit
[17:45] yourself one to the other in the fear of
[17:48] God wise submit yourself unto your own
[17:53] husbands as unto the Lord that's right
[17:56] for the husband is the head of the wife
[17:59] even as Christ is the head of the church
[18:01] and he is the savior of the
[18:04] body therefore the church no therefore
[18:08] as the church is subject unto Christ let
[18:11] the wife be to their own husbands in
[18:14] everything right husbands this is what
[18:18] the broad party on the man husband love
[18:22] your wife even as Christ loved the
[18:24] church and gave himself for it that he
[18:28] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[18:31] washing of the Water by the word let us
[18:35] pray father God we ask you one more time
[18:38] help us oh God to yield our bodies and
[18:40] our minds and our soul to you God father
[18:44] God I ask you God to speak one more time
[18:45] through your word Lord now father God I
[18:48] give you all my strength give you all my
[18:50] mind and all my soul and spirit Lord in
[18:53] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[18:56] bless you you may be seated one moment
[18:59] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[19:01] word of God this evening that's right I
[19:03] took from the scripture the way it was
[19:05] saying here it was in the Book of
[19:07] Genesis how was telling Eve it was
[19:10] speaking here after they had fell they
[19:12] told it God dealing with it he told Eve
[19:14] here in the 16th verse he said unto the
[19:16] woman I was unto the woman he said I
[19:19] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[19:21] conception and a conception and and let
[19:25] me find my place excuse me and
[19:27] conception and thou shall pray for
[19:29] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[19:32] husband and he shall rule over thee now
[19:36] it hadn't always been that way
[19:39] Hallelujah if you notice it was not that
[19:41] way when she was in Adam Hall once she
[19:44] was when she was in Adam Hallelujah if
[19:48] she would have never been
[19:50] separated from Adam it wouldn't have
[19:53] never been a fall right and if there
[19:55] wouldn't have never been a fall there
[19:56] would never been a redeemer right there
[19:59] would never been a savior if there would
[20:01] never been a fall but because there was
[20:03] a fall it opened the door for a redeemer
[20:06] and a savior amen amen yes sir we
[20:09] thinking here in my title this
[20:11] evening is Satan
[20:14] TCT Satan attack on the power of His
[20:19] lordship tan hate one thing in the
[20:22] church and that's lordship that's right
[20:25] and the reason he hate that lordship
[20:27] because it's saying submit yourself one
[20:31] to the other Hallelujah in other words
[20:33] obey them that have rule over you
[20:36] Hallelujah in other words here so he God
[20:39] is telling us hallelujah to be in
[20:42] Authority but also be under Authority
[20:45] Brother Sam is not in himself he's a
[20:48] pastor so he's he got the brother said
[20:51] the Pastor is the supreme authority of
[20:53] the church but really he's under
[20:55] Authority because the word is over him
[20:58] exactly right so that's what the
[21:00] authority is it ain't the man he's in
[21:02] authority to the word and if you hear
[21:04] the man you come in Authority subject to
[21:06] the man and then then you obey God right
[21:09] so we begin to realize so that was Satan
[21:12] main tag y he didn't care Satan don't
[21:17] care how religious you are that's right
[21:20] he don't care how much you worship come
[21:22] on he don't care how much you say you
[21:23] love
[21:25] God he just don't want the Revelation
[21:27] you got hu that Christ not only become
[21:31] God but he become your lord and savior
[21:34] and your Redeemer Hall that's what he
[21:37] don't want right that's right so when I
[21:39] want to look at a few scriptures in
[21:41] Genesis for a few minutes I'm just
[21:43] looking at this in Genesis 1 where God
[21:47] uh you can just write these down real
[21:48] quick where God gave adam Dominion
[21:51] Genesis 1 128 to Adam I'm give you
[21:53] Dominion h i want you to be Lord over
[21:55] the Earth Adam H Adam I'm the Lord of
[21:57] Heaven but I'm giving you lordship how
[22:00] do I give you and Adam I want you to
[22:02] sedu the Earth andwhere I'm going to
[22:05] give you lordship and you shall do it
[22:07] how that mean to keep it in line with
[22:09] the
[22:10] word hallu that when we come here this
[22:13] evening how to keep our life in line
[22:15] with the word h that why you come to
[22:17] church Faith come by hear and by hearing
[22:20] of the word of God to keep your life in
[22:22] line with the
[22:23] word so we begin to look
[22:26] here so when we begin to realize here
[22:29] so but Satan attacked his first attack
[22:32] in
[22:33] Genesis in Genesis 1 I mean
[22:36] 31 I want you to know when Satan moved
[22:39] in for his
[22:41] attack and I know what he told he you
[22:43] know what he he misinterpret the word
[22:47] right but he could not have got in and
[22:50] and brought the destruction to the human
[22:52] race unto first he tack lordship right
[22:56] exactly let us look at Genesis 1
[22:59] I mean Genesis
[23:01] 3:1 look how it read
[23:04] here it says now the serent was more sub
[23:08] than any beast of the field which the
[23:11] Lord God had made right and he said unto
[23:15] the woman yet God has said ye should not
[23:17] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[23:20] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[23:22] of the fruit of the tree uhh the Trees
[23:25] of the garden but of the fruit of the
[23:27] tree which is in the midst Son of God
[23:29] that God has God has said yeah shall not
[23:32] eat of it neither shall you touch it l
[23:34] you die so we got a problem here the
[23:37] problem was when sat come into the
[23:40] Garden of Eden the problem was not
[23:43] God the problem was
[23:46] Lord so the first thing if you notice
[23:49] when he comes into the G the first thing
[23:51] he take out of the word first word ever
[23:53] been took out of the Bible since the
[23:55] creation of time he took Lord out of it
[23:58] amen because the Bible say the Lord God
[24:00] said why Satan didn't quote the eeve
[24:03] what he what it was when God said it he
[24:06] did not come to Eve and say the Lord God
[24:08] said he said God said because he did not
[24:12] have a problem with her having to God
[24:13] neither do he have a problem with you
[24:15] having a God he don't care if you have a
[24:17] God how ever in the world everywhere we
[24:19] go people got God that they worship some
[24:22] in the house some of their car some in
[24:24] their wife some of their job a God he
[24:26] don't care about a God but he when you
[24:28] say
[24:29] Lord you are said I am under protection
[24:33] of his lordship and Lord is the name of
[24:36] protection what the righteous run into
[24:38] not sa Lord so we so we begin to look
[24:43] here he he moved the Lord out of the
[24:46] scripture once he got eeve to say what
[24:48] he said not what God Said right hallelu
[24:52] one word off is Satan kingom right so he
[24:55] just took one word out of the scripture
[24:58] Lord he quoted God to Eve oh yeah and
[25:03] Eve quoted God back right but what she
[25:07] didn't say the Lord God said right she
[25:09] said God said what God how what God Said
[25:14] So now he got her not quoting what God
[25:17] Said got her quoting what he said she
[25:20] had disarmed herself how she become uh
[25:23] pray for the enemy s move right in and
[25:26] took over right man what he do today he
[25:29] he comes in to take out the power of
[25:32] lordship because as long as you under
[25:35] lordship he know he can't get to you
[25:37] right right the Bible don't give and
[25:40] that is a name under the L under that
[25:42] lordship he know long as you under that
[25:45] protection as long as that wife is under
[25:47] the protection as long as the church is
[25:49] under protection of his lordship how the
[25:51] say cannot come here and take it over
[25:53] but once he break down
[25:55] lordship he let the people worship he
[25:57] let the people have a good time how you
[25:59] let say I love God but then he knowing
[26:03] then that longer they worshiping God as
[26:05] long as they have a good time but do not
[26:08] mean that they are protected your
[26:10] protection is under lordship right
[26:13] amen let's look at it this way so now if
[26:17] you notice once she did this she had she
[26:21] moved out of her position she moved from
[26:24] her position cuz she in the beginning
[26:27] she was create it and she walked eagal
[26:29] with God W eagle with Adam when you
[26:32] called Adam she turned around
[26:35] too because she turned around too so in
[26:39] word any because she in word that name
[26:41] was Adam how but if you notice once she
[26:45] uh walked beyond the principles of
[26:47] lordship she received a new name yeah
[26:50] right right Hallelujah she received
[26:52] another name Adam called her name Eve
[26:56] Hallelujah why because she has stepter
[26:58] the the boundary of the protection of
[27:01] God she received a new name the mother
[27:04] all living right
[27:06] exactly I look at this thing here that's
[27:09] right and now we begin to look
[27:11] here and as I was studying this I begin
[27:13] to look here I say now we begin to
[27:16] understand Paul goes over in Ephesians
[27:20] and then Paul begin to put an order
[27:22] again how the position of lordship see
[27:26] now I want you to understand here I'm
[27:28] GNA I'm W to look at a few things real
[27:31] quick I want to be H Paul as he goes
[27:34] over here he put in the position of
[27:36] lordship he begin to tell her this is
[27:38] the order that God want the church to
[27:40] run in so then he if you notice he goes
[27:43] over here and then and and and even God
[27:45] when he came in Genesis and Eve made his
[27:48] mistake he told Eve all right people say
[27:51] well he cursed he he didn't curse you
[27:54] yeah he couldn't curse you without
[27:56] cursing ad d right you know I hear that
[28:00] a lot of times you know you hear that
[28:01] statement they well brother the woman is
[28:03] cursed well and Words If a woman is
[28:06] cursed if you marry yourself to a cursed
[28:10] woman you you curs with her God did not
[28:13] curse he told you this is what going to
[28:16] happen this is the penality you have
[28:18] brought death into it how do you be
[28:21] saved and child
[28:23] burn right and your desire shall be to
[28:27] your husband showing you that she had
[28:29] gave her Desir to somebody else outside
[28:31] her husband how now he was turning her
[28:33] back to her head she he said no longer
[28:36] he you he shall be your ruler that's
[28:39] right he shall rule over you but we
[28:41] going to get to that part in a minute I
[28:42] want to look at a few things real quick
[28:46] before we go forward I looked up the
[28:48] word
[28:50] lordship and I come up with some
[28:51] definitions on lordship and you know and
[28:54] one of the definition was lordship
[28:57] number one
[28:58] definition was having power and
[29:03] authority right that what it means it
[29:05] mean having power and authority I looked
[29:08] at some scriptures I thought here we
[29:10] find here power and authority how I
[29:13] looked up in like like Matthew 7:28 it
[29:15] say he taught as one having Authority
[29:19] and not as the scribes so when he taught
[29:22] his message was just not a me it had
[29:25] power and authority behind it how show
[29:27] them we Preach Today you said brother J
[29:30] do it have to be loud do it have to be
[29:31] this way no it got to have power and
[29:33] authority and only what gives the
[29:35] message power and authority is you stay
[29:37] in the truth and the power behind truth
[29:40] amen right then it also number two it
[29:44] means master and owner right and I find
[29:49] here that Jesus said in Matthew 28 these
[29:51] things I to put down when I got inspired
[29:54] Matthew 28 and and and and and verse 9
[29:57] and 18 is said and Jesus and Jesus spoke
[30:00] uh Jesus spoke unto him saying all power
[30:03] yeah is given unto me in heaven and
[30:06] earth Hallelujah in other words I am the
[30:08] master and I'm the owner exactly and
[30:11] then then it
[30:13] means the other one mean Empire or
[30:17] King that that was the next definition
[30:20] of an Empire or King and out word I find
[30:23] out Revelation 19:16 it said he's king
[30:27] of King and Lord of lords Hallelujah so
[30:30] at number four definition for it it
[30:32] means father and husband uhhuh father
[30:36] and husband how what did Jesus say Our
[30:39] Father which are in heaven so he he
[30:42] identified himself under lordship and a
[30:44] father and husband Hallelujah and number
[30:47] five it means revelation of deity Glory
[30:52] man that was strong one the revelation
[30:54] of deity Hallelujah the revelation of
[30:57] deity and where so we begin to realize
[30:59] here so that what we want to speak over
[31:01] here on the power of His lordship the
[31:03] revelation of his guilty and I looked up
[31:05] in the Greek that master mean the master
[31:07] mean
[31:08] one Lord who possesses supreme authority
[31:14] Dominion how didn't I looked at these
[31:16] things I begin to think here on lordship
[31:18] man I got sweat in my ey
[31:23] y find oh there you go
[31:28] man thank God my God I just come out of
[31:31] Africa preaching
[31:33] 125
[31:36] 125° it was so hot that you I'm going
[31:40] sweat anyway and the brother said he was
[31:42] looking at me preaching my associate
[31:44] pastor he was there he was there that
[31:46] morning I preaching on that screen he
[31:48] normally my tie dripped he said when he
[31:50] looked at my tie it was running a screen
[31:52] of water he said I don't believe this by
[31:56] the time I got back home I was in the
[31:57] bed for 4 days I'm so tired and weak
[32:01] here just this time it was extremely hot
[32:04] I thank you for your sacrifice I thank
[32:06] you for the offers you gave it went real
[32:08] good we was in Togo we preaching we
[32:10] started off in kamasi we had meetings
[32:13] christma convention in kamasi we left
[32:16] kamasi West Africa we went we went into
[32:18] Togo which is another country across the
[32:20] border you don't want to drive across
[32:22] the border you making a mistake but we
[32:24] done it but we made it across the border
[32:26] normally that's the first time drove we
[32:28] always flyed and took a plane then you
[32:30] know it was a little easy but when you
[32:32] drive across the border you going into a
[32:34] whole different game so then we drove
[32:36] across the border we had meetings at too
[32:38] we come back across too with the cry we
[32:40] started meetings again in 12 days we was
[32:43] there for 12 days they did 18
[32:45] Services
[32:47] wow it was only had one
[32:50] problem one problem I had when I first
[32:53] went there after the last time I was
[32:55] there it was 8 years ago I come back 8
[32:58] years later I had one problem I had
[33:01] eight more
[33:03] birthdays this time I could tell it when
[33:06] I come on I had I really tell when I
[33:10] come to
[33:12] side I'm I understand why they say
[33:15] brother I'm getting H I'm not too old
[33:17] yet I ain't going to say that but I can
[33:18] tell you what I can tell that since I
[33:20] was eight years later I told a big
[33:22] different but here we are we talk about
[33:24] lordship here hallelujah in other word
[33:26] possessing Authority and Dominion now we
[33:28] want to begin to look here because I
[33:30] want to realize here why have Satan
[33:33] tacked the position of the woman right
[33:35] yeah right ABS why he attack the church
[33:38] world right why he attack that because
[33:40] he knew if he could break the power
[33:43] lordship he could conquer the nation
[33:45] right remember Eve could not be Eve
[33:48] could not manifest this perversion until
[33:52] she left her head right and the church
[33:54] once you leave your head you'll believe
[33:56] anything right amen so now what she do
[34:00] she go she left her head and what it is
[34:02] that's what he been tagging and that
[34:03] what he been tagging he keep tagging it
[34:05] over and over Hallelujah in other words
[34:08] his lordship he been tagging the
[34:09] lordship of this nation Hallelujah until
[34:12] he finally broke the back bone right
[34:14] right right now what we got we got
[34:16] perversion on every hand right but first
[34:20] he had to T because he knew the woman
[34:22] type the church and he told the woman in
[34:25] Paul us suffer another woman to Usher
[34:27] authority to be submission under the
[34:29] husband how do we know that word right
[34:31] there is hate word in our nation yeah
[34:33] right everybody say why because Eagle
[34:36] rights bringing every uh bringing the
[34:38] woman into the same position that the
[34:40] man in it was against God commandment
[34:43] how she should be under Authority and
[34:46] the man is under God right right so now
[34:49] we begin to look at we begin to take it
[34:51] here as I begin to look here let's us
[34:53] look at little I'm just taking it from a
[34:55] different approach tonight Ain know you
[34:57] ain't never here but it just kind of
[34:58] think about so we found out
[35:01] here tting his tack has been on this
[35:04] position and he been fighting against it
[35:06] all this time because he know if he can
[35:09] break the if he can break the backbone
[35:11] of this nation he could call perversion
[35:14] to come in once he broke the BR bonger
[35:16] headship in the garden he had no longer
[35:20] knew what she was uh in a relationship
[35:23] with she had a relationship with
[35:26] something that was apart from human
[35:28] human
[35:30] mentality right and that what caused our
[35:33] problem right right now what we got we
[35:35] got a bunch of Beast allergy moving over
[35:37] this nation and nothing nobody can do
[35:40] about it right why because she broke the
[35:42] word all the for she had to lead the
[35:45] word what brought the denominations into
[35:47] among of the Beast they left the word
[35:49] and took a beastly seed it was not the
[35:52] seed of a it was not the seed of the
[35:53] word it was the seed of the Beast
[35:55] hallelujah what made her take the bo she
[35:57] took took the seed of the Beast by
[35:59] rejecting
[36:00] headship that's right let look here if I
[36:03] tired
[36:05] Edge the I turn Edge he's speaking on
[36:08] the things here and I'm going to you see
[36:11] where we going in second I turn Edge on
[36:13] a page two Church a book page 2 215 he
[36:17] said now a woman is not meant to have an
[36:19] iron
[36:21] disposition and where he's he bringing
[36:23] he look at that he taking the woman he
[36:25] typing out the church she is according
[36:29] to the Holy scripture to be submission
[36:32] to the male right now we know we know in
[36:34] this day and time that is foreign
[36:37] language that's right amen now real
[36:39] submission is you'll see I'm going to
[36:41] get the man cuz I know how these heres
[36:44] in the message look at this submission
[36:46] HJ you know here I am he man I'm wait I
[36:50] finish this and submission and
[36:52] submission to the male for this as the
[36:55] Commandment of her a woman who is truly
[36:58] female and all female would want to be
[37:00] in that disposition not a doormat right
[37:04] right that's it not a doormat right no
[37:07] real male makes a female a doormat but
[37:10] one will want to be under
[37:13] Authority and not to rule over the male
[37:16] for he is the head of the
[37:19] house he is the what right okay we long
[37:24] we want to get that
[37:25] scra is she breaks that image on that
[37:30] God had made for her she is
[37:33] perverted perversion and way it brings
[37:36] her in the spirit that evil was in
[37:39] perversion she would not if she come
[37:42] that way she will be pregnant it by
[37:44] wrong Spirit right and if any man that
[37:48] let the woman break that that image he
[37:51] is perverted and then way and the way
[37:54] bring the spirit of perversion when a
[37:57] woman stepped out of her position and
[37:59] the man let her it put both of them in
[38:01] the spirit of of this perverted ede
[38:04] remember you could not have
[38:05] homosexuality until the woman come out
[38:08] of her place right exactly that's right
[38:11] come on people how many kids is rap
[38:14] without a father right right oh yeah I
[38:16] worked in a school and a little boy had
[38:19] to use a the boy bathroom he didn't know
[38:22] how to use the boy the bathroom like a
[38:24] boy so the the principal said go
[38:28] show him how to use the bathroom he's
[38:29] not a girl but all he been raised with
[38:32] his grandma and his mama yeah so he
[38:35] thought that he should use the bathroom
[38:36] that way so what it do it bring that
[38:39] perversion Spirit over on the over into
[38:41] the male Kingdom once did he left the
[38:43] word she brought she brought that
[38:45] perversion Spirit over with her and the
[38:47] man let down the word it brought it
[38:50] brought the perversion spirit in this
[38:52] nation and in the P pit now we got to
[38:55] pert and then what's the problem the
[38:57] problem was we left the
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] word ain't no problem it's the problem
[39:03] is they left the word now they don't
[39:05] left so they they totally blashe and God
[39:07] won't accept no repenting no
[39:10] more as a nation that's right now you
[39:14] said brother J you said man that that is
[39:16] a because God is he is our protector and
[39:20] he only protect us as we stay true to
[39:22] the word Jezebel left the word and then
[39:25] when she refused Elijah as her Prophet
[39:28] as her pastor that's right how did she
[39:30] refuse Elijah know what she refused to
[39:34] hear the word for that day which was a
[39:36] prophet right and when she refused the
[39:39] uh when she refused the word it brought
[39:42] the nation into perversion how the
[39:44] people is nothing to do right can you
[39:47] feel Rapture in
[39:48] there it could not the Rapture could not
[39:51] take place until this nation completely

[42:07] right let let's go in here look so let
[42:10] us look at a little step forward now I
[42:12] want you to notice here I want you to
[42:14] notice here because this is what this is
[42:17] I'm kind of getting to my point here in
[42:18] other words so here we was Eve had took
[42:23] on her own identity she had left Adam
[42:26] had left her husband the word how Adam
[42:28] had no
[42:30] right he could had no right he could let
[42:33] Eve stay and die and be burned with the
[42:36] serpent that's 104 the church book he
[42:39] should not have Tule back the take back
[42:42] he would have to take a harlot because
[42:44] she just proved herself as an Unfaithful
[42:47] wife not wly she was deceive into it
[42:51] that's right that's right and when I was
[42:54] studying this the Holy Spirit begin to
[42:55] break this out here I said Lord I said
[42:57] that's it I you know for your brother
[43:00] Jesus say from the beginning was not so
[43:03] and when I'm think I'm not pre man the
[43:06] voice I'm not preing but I'm just I'm
[43:08] just this is hit me by inspiration and
[43:11] I'm trying to put out here and in the
[43:12] beginning was not so well it was not
[43:15] know a divorce case in the beginning
[43:17] Hallelujah Adam did not put evil way and
[43:20] Adam had a reason for not putting away I
[43:23] looked at the scripture this is what
[43:25] really hit me let us let's go and look
[43:27] at in Genesis
[43:32] 2 Genesis
[43:36] 2 now there brother says you know when
[43:40] she cut her she just she show her
[43:43] unfaithfulness or dishonor of her head
[43:46] right and and she's a you know a
[43:49] believing woman and if a man got an
[43:51] unbelieving wife he should bear with her
[43:53] give her grace in other words and that
[43:56] but he can't not be a
[43:58] pushover but in other word because God
[44:01] didn't when he told now before this
[44:03] whole that play if you Noti here he gave
[44:06] man's a commandment and the Commandment
[44:08] for a man to do is to love your wife
[44:11] right H that that that you know people
[44:14] think and the uh Dominion ship lordship
[44:17] I'm going to make her do what I want her
[44:19] to do well that ain't your dog or your
[44:24] horse that's your wife you when she
[44:27] don't believe the word how how can she B

[44:41] can you get somebody to bleed and you
[44:42] can't live up to the level of Jesus
[44:45] Christ well she Sarah called Abraham
[44:49] Lord in a hor she brother say she called
[44:51] him Lord because he lived up to the word
[44:56] she seen something
[44:57] that she wanted to make him her Lord and
[45:01] if she don't make you Lord you ain't
[45:02] going to get the position right she got
[45:05] to submit herself to give you that
[45:08] position so come

[48:30] either going to have to leave my house
[48:32] it can't be two of us here he I tell you
[48:34] what if you beat me I'll leave if I beat
[48:37] you you leave yeah he come to work I
[48:39] seen his eyes all
[48:42] black I said man what has happened to
[48:44] him over the weekend and the guy said he
[48:46] told his son if he beat him he'll leave
[48:49] if he beat him well the story is it he
[48:53] the one moved out
[48:55] right yeah so don't do
[48:58] that you might think you float like a
[49:01] butterfly now that a
[49:05] but therefore man shall leave his father
[49:08] and
[49:10] mother and
[49:12] shall clean unto his wife right and they
[49:15] shall be what man so Adam God told Adam
[49:20] for this CA shall a man leave his father
[49:23] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[49:25] wife and they shall
[49:27] unto his wife and they shall be one
[49:31] flesh I want to right there I want you
[49:34] to notice that and what got my attention
[49:36] to this is when I looked this word up
[49:39] clean mean Inseparable right it means
[49:43] one mate in other word So Adam when God
[49:46] told Adam I'm going to eat the clean to
[49:48] you Hallelujah when Adam saw his wife
[49:51] Coming she was in a condition that Adam
[49:54] did not have to take her back that's
[49:56] right right
[49:57] exactly but it was displaying the love
[50:00] of God Adam did not save Eve because
[50:03] Adam need Redemption for himself Adam
[50:06] just play What Love
[50:08] isah Adam loved his wife so much that he
[50:12] went out behind the word to take his
[50:15] wife back right knowing that God was
[50:17] going to come down right God loved his
[50:20] son so much that himself he came down in
[50:23] the garden Hallelujah in other words
[50:25] Adam would not L if Adam would had took
[50:27] her back God had to destroy her right
[50:30] but when Adam took her back Hallelujah
[50:31] she was part of Adam now God could not
[50:33] score he without destroying Adam right
[50:36] just like God could not destroy how he
[50:39] would not let the devil have so God
[50:41] himself had to come down and make a way
[50:44] back that what we F that why we got
[50:47] Redemption it ain't through it because
[50:50] when we fa Adam the first Adam man he
[50:52] fell he walked out behind the word of
[50:55] God and took took e by brought the whole
[50:58] human race into
[51:00] adultery brother he that joined himself
[51:03] to adulteries is adulteries right he
[51:05] joined the whole human race into
[51:07] adulteries invisible Union brother said
[51:09] we was all born adulteries exactly I
[51:11] don't care how holy you are I don't care
[51:13] what family you were born in I don't
[51:15] care how long you been if you don't be
[51:17] born again you are born in
[51:20] adultery you come to the world speaking
[51:22] lies right who taught you how to lie
[51:25] yeah come on right I mean you said well
[51:28] how you learn how to lie I didn't read a
[51:31] book to learn how to
[51:33] lie I could have been a lawyer at one
[51:38] time I ain't getting I didn't had to go
[51:40] to school for it I could have been a
[51:43] lawyer I mean you know who's bad that
[51:46] just the way things was you you li so
[51:48] much you start believing in yourself
[51:52] yeah but what caused that because we
[51:55] were born that way amen we were born
[51:57] with this corruptible nature how we come
[52:00] in the world under this adultery act how
[52:02] we was in we shaped in iniquity we were
[52:04] born the wrong way from the beginning so
[52:06] we Automatic by Nature we was adulterate
[52:09] how did the brother say invisible Union
[52:11] page 33 he said that is the reason you
[52:13] were born in adultery because you were a
[52:15] centner to begin with that's right you
[52:18] were you were dece into you had in other
[52:22] word it's not it's not your it's not no
[52:26] no it is not your fault you never did it
[52:28] because that little germ man he go to
[52:31] the Jour he goes to the mind of God out
[52:34] of the way that God saw you not the way
[52:36] that you saw yourself he that little
[52:38] germ that was to be you and found you
[52:40] and before the foundation of the world
[52:42] and your name was put in the L's book of
[52:43] life so he put this an adulterous now we
[52:46] realize Revelation teacher ain't no
[52:48] adulterous going to enter the Kingdom of
[52:49] Heaven how no adulter why you think
[52:52] Jesus telling Nicodemus you must be born
[52:55] again because I canot you in under that
[52:58] nature that nature cannot come in the
[53:00] presence of God that's right that what
[53:02] the new birth is
[53:04] for what the new bir yes sir so we begin
[53:07] get here so Adam took Eve to
[53:10] himself he walked out if we got the
[53:13] scripture Commander don't let no man put
[53:15] a
[53:16] son hallah don't let no man Eve came to
[53:19] Adam when she came to Adam she was
[53:22] already had perverted herself she had
[53:25] mixed her human SE up with a beast right
[53:28] that was real low really yeah that real
[53:31] low and she brought it to Adam and God
[53:35] couldn't accept Adam did not have to
[53:37] accept her in that condition right but
[53:39] just said husband love your wife right
[53:42] yes Adam said I'm not letting this
[53:43] separate me from my wife I love her

[56:46] been uh that's been chased not having
[56:48] spot or wrinkle H why word because he
[56:51] don't want nothing in our life that
[56:53] going to hinder us that when he come he
[56:57] took us to himself that he might present
[56:59] it to himself a glorious church not
[57:01] having Spot Not A Wrinkle or not any
[57:03] such thing but it shall be be holy and
[57:07] Without Blame right exactly so we he he
[57:11] don't we we just we come in here Lord
[57:13] let me come to the revelation of your
[57:16] lordship right now I want you to notice
[57:19] this before Jesus came I mean when Jesus
[57:23] walk with his disciples excuse me had
[57:26] you ever noticed the whole time Jesus
[57:29] was on Earth with his
[57:31] disciples they never acknowledged his
[57:34] lordship they acknowledged they'll say
[57:37] they called him they called him uh
[57:41] Master right did you remember that they
[57:44] called him Master right they called him
[57:46] teacher when Nicodemus met him he
[57:49] approached him and he says uh in other
[57:52] word he he came to him call me and rabi
[57:55] they called him on the thing let uh how
[57:57] did let the St John 3
[58:03] one Nicodemus come to him in St John 3
[58:07] verse one and the Bible teaches us that
[58:10] Nicodemus there was a a man of the
[58:12] Pharisee named Nicodemus a ruler over of
[58:15] the Jews the the same came to Jesus by
[58:19] night saying un him
[58:21] rebi you notice they never come to him
[58:24] they didn't come to him never preaching
[58:26] him in the Lord Jesus Christ while he
[58:28] was on Earth H they came to him he came
[58:31] to him R Master Teachers H even they
[58:35] they acknowledge Jesus you remember this
[58:37] lady she came to Jesus and she was
[58:39] needing something for him and she called
[58:41] him the name she said thy son of David
[58:45] thy son of David he was not even going
[58:48] to deal with her on that level how
[58:50] because he was not her he was not son of
[58:52] David to her dog right that's right
[58:55] right
[58:56] but when she said Lord she moved into
[58:58] Redemption exactly that was a Redemptive
[59:01] name his seven Redemptive name is under
[59:03] the Lord when she say Lord right cuz he
[59:07] was the Lord to Healing all the disease
[59:09] she got what she want you got to know
[59:11] when you approach him you have to
[59:12] approach him the right
[59:14] way that's so he goes on here says here
[59:17] and Nicodemus he's a rebbi and then what
[59:20] he come he come to
[59:22] Jesus and he's giving Jesus a compliment
[59:26] for his
[59:28] ministry if a man he said we know that
[59:30] there a teacher we
[59:33] know Satan
[59:35] know the power of His
[59:38] lordship Satan have Satan only not only
[59:41] do he know he believes in one God one
[59:45] faith and one
[59:46] baptism the problem of he got he cannot
[59:49] submit to it right he cannot let him
[59:51] become his ruler he wanted his own will
[59:55] but say know who he is more than the
[59:56] people do right that's right Jesus had
[59:59] to tell demon to hold your peace don't
[1:00:01] you tell the people who I am right
[1:00:03] exactly right sure is exactly because
[1:00:06] they know who he was but they blind the
[1:00:09] people to believe something else right
[1:00:10] that's right so nemon came to him he
[1:00:12] said Rabbi he said we know that th
[1:00:15] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:00:17] these Miracles that thou does except God
[1:00:20] be with him in other words so now see if
[1:00:22] you
[1:00:24] notice if you noce
[1:00:26] he said no man does any Mir except God
[1:00:29] be with him he never could he didn't say
[1:00:31] except the Lord God he said except God
[1:00:34] go he can he can acknowledge his godship
[1:00:37] but not his lordship H so Jesus if you
[1:00:41] give somebody a compliment on something
[1:00:43] praise now I'm going to give the
[1:00:45] difference between praise and worship
[1:00:47] here come this man he come to give Jesus
[1:00:49] praise for something that he was doing
[1:00:52] for his miracles he was doing that
[1:00:54] deserve praise Hallelujah
[1:00:56] Jesus should have been excited because
[1:00:58] the teachers and the rabbi understood
[1:01:00] his Miracle he another words they giv
[1:01:03] somebody come up to you know it's hard
[1:01:04] somebody come say look what you do
[1:01:06] hallah you think thank
[1:01:09] you that's praise right somebody buy you
[1:01:12] a new car you going to praise
[1:01:14] him you going to be glad to tell
[1:01:16] everybody that brother right there he
[1:01:18] just brought me a new car H you know I
[1:01:20] mean it's just that way it's just that
[1:01:21] way if if somebody do something for you
[1:01:23] is pray they gave Jesus pray H but Jesus
[1:01:26] never even acknowledge it he never
[1:01:29] acknowledged the praise service right he
[1:01:32] told Nicodemus you must be born again
[1:01:35] Hallelujah why because you got to come
[1:01:36] into the revelation of who who this Lord
[1:01:39] is H the only way you can know him is by
[1:01:41] the new birth Glory right that's
[1:01:44] it so you understand once they got the
[1:01:47] Holy Ghost once they got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:50] Peter didn't no longer he didn't need to
[1:01:51] call him Master he said this Jesus that
[1:01:53] you crucify he both Lord and right Paul
[1:01:56] met him on the road to the master hallu
[1:01:58] after Paul started writing the word of
[1:02:00] God he never wrote him as as Rabbi he
[1:02:02] never wrote him as Master he never WR
[1:02:04] teach he said this Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:02:07] understood his
[1:02:09] deity yes sir amen
[1:02:12] hallelujah that what the Revelation
[1:02:14] doing we we don't know we know him his
[1:02:17] praise in way he told you must be except
[1:02:20] a man be born again he cannot even see
[1:02:22] the kingdom of God you will never
[1:02:24] recognize his lordship without the birth
[1:02:27] no man can call Jesus the Christ without
[1:02:29] the Holy Ghost so that Revelation Alone
[1:02:32] come by the new birth amen that's right
[1:02:35] hallelujah amen so I begin to look
[1:02:37] around but now I'm going to define the
[1:02:40] difference between praise and
[1:02:44] worship cuz people get worship and
[1:02:46] praise mixed up you know you know praise
[1:02:49] is to give somebody you moderation for
[1:02:52] something that they done you can give
[1:02:54] anybody praise yeah anything you can
[1:02:56] praise but you can't worship any in
[1:02:58] other words if you going to worship
[1:02:59] something that going to become your God
[1:03:01] or your lord or whatever it is cuz now
[1:03:03] you moving into a different uh a
[1:03:05] different uh in other word you in word
[1:03:08] praise you give but worship you moving
[1:03:09] into a different Channel H so here it is
[1:03:12] so now what you understand when Jesus
[1:03:13] came he had to he had to defy the differ
[1:03:16] between praise and worship in his
[1:03:18] ministry H if you remember when he met
[1:03:20] the woman at the well how do we he come
[1:03:21] to her and all the stuff we know he told
[1:03:23] her her sins and went on and then she he
[1:03:25] said I father the worship in this
[1:03:28] mountain but Jesus knew that was not a
[1:03:30] worship service that was only a praise
[1:03:33] service right hey Jesus said yeah I know
[1:03:36] they worship it in mou but they don't
[1:03:38] even know what they worship right
[1:03:40] exactly whatever they were doing in the
[1:03:42] mountain they would not worshiping God
[1:03:43] they would up there they might have been
[1:03:44] praising the a God right righten but
[1:03:47] they didn't know what they were praying
[1:03:49] worshiping you cannot worship God except
[1:03:51] you know him right so Jesus turned
[1:03:53] around and say they to worship he it
[1:03:56] going to come a time you going to
[1:03:57] worship a God in Jerusalem another in
[1:04:00] this mountain but you will worship me
[1:04:02] and spirit and Truth worship is know who
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:05] are you shall know the truth that's
[1:04:07] right and the truth should make you
[1:04:09] bring you to worship so when you come
[1:04:11] the truth you say what is my worship
[1:04:13] service is what we doing tonight we
[1:04:14] didn't come we didn't just come to have
[1:04:16] a some Churches tonight is a Wednesday

[1:07:30] love your wife as the man stay under
[1:07:32] godhe headship the church stay up under
[1:07:34] the man has submitt herself not to the
[1:07:37] man but to the revelation of the Lord
[1:07:40] Jesus Christ which is the word made
[1:07:41] flesh right words so now we going on
[1:07:44] here we look here one more thing I want
[1:07:46] to
[1:07:47] bring this love here must be displayed
[1:07:50] in a way that a
[1:07:54] circumstance see people let circum they
[1:07:56] say well the circumstance come up and I
[1:07:59] no longer can go to church anymore
[1:08:00] Brother Sam I got too many things going
[1:08:02] on in my life in my home I no longer can
[1:08:05] I come to church first thing they do
[1:08:07] they ready to quit God circumstances in
[1:08:10] other words circumstances does not
[1:08:12] change God's mind right if God love you
[1:08:16] it ain't nobody can do nothing about it
[1:08:18] right I mean you know word God loved
[1:08:20] Jacob and I don't care what Jacob done
[1:08:22] it didn't change God mind about Jacob
[1:08:24] Hallelujah in other words we would have
[1:08:25] probably put jaed out cuz he done done
[1:08:27] Esau real wrong yes sir he did and we
[1:08:29] would have judged the matter we would
[1:08:31] have said that low down
[1:08:33] deceiver I mean that's the way I would
[1:08:35] looked at it that is human instinct I
[1:08:37] mean you know good G he done beat him
[1:08:38] out all his money sto everything the man
[1:08:41] had and in other word but God did not
[1:08:43] change his mind about Jacob Jacob I have
[1:08:46] loved and Esau I have hated hallelu so
[1:08:49] in words so God love you it ain't
[1:08:51] nothing nobody can do about it right
[1:08:53] amen you said wa what you said mayy you
[1:08:56] say well if God love me and I'm doing
[1:08:58] this and I'm doing that I'm not serving
[1:09:00] God what would God do he'll take you
[1:09:02] home abely he said that's why many
[1:09:04] weaken and sicking among us because God
[1:09:06] loved them and he took them off he took
[1:09:08] them home early hallah a lot of time we
[1:09:10] see early grave and that person is a
[1:09:12] waverer and he never get sell God take
[1:09:14] him home right that's that's God love
[1:09:17] really right so now I going to read one
[1:09:21] more scripture then I'm going to let you
[1:09:23] go for Theon night I'm going to read
[1:09:24] here
[1:09:25] that why Paul wrote about God
[1:09:28] love Paul it was no other
[1:09:31] Apostle could write with the feelings
[1:09:34] that Paul wrote it you noce why God let
[1:09:36] Paul write so many it ain't none of them
[1:09:39] could write with the feelings that Paul
[1:09:42] write it the scripture with so Paul
[1:09:44] wrote it with a feeling Hallelujah like
[1:09:46] no other wrote all of them had the
[1:09:48] experence was God Paul never met Jesus
[1:09:51] In the Flesh he never went fishing with
[1:09:53] Jesus he never went hunting with Jesus
[1:09:55] he never had a fish ride never got on a
[1:09:56] boat ride with him according to history
[1:09:59] he never even met the man but he still
[1:10:01] met him but he didn't meet him as master
[1:10:04] or teacher he met him as the Lord Jesus
[1:10:06] Christ the anointed revelation of the
[1:10:08] word how so he met him that way so he
[1:10:11] knew him the same way even in depth more
[1:10:14] than what the disciple knew and they
[1:10:15] went fishing with
[1:10:18] him so that don't mean because you
[1:10:21] people grew up in new brother BR they
[1:10:22] ain't got nothing to do with it if you
[1:10:24] met him by re you met him in the you met
[1:10:27] him in the way that God intend for you
[1:10:28] to meet him without seeing him he been
[1:10:30] revealed to you nobody can't take that T
[1:10:33] from
[1:10:34] you you got people that saw brother
[1:10:37] Brandon people explain the dty of God
[1:10:39] away and made him worship a man right
[1:10:41] yeah right you had enough preacher that
[1:10:43] could took the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:10:46] away and turned to people to wash a man
[1:10:48] that was born the same way I born how
[1:10:51] did brother Brandon was a man that knew
[1:10:53] how to yield himself so God can speak
[1:10:55] right right that why we giving respect
[1:10:58] but we not just going here and why
[1:11:00] people going back on the message because
[1:11:01] they Tred to look at a man mate instead
[1:11:04] of looking at the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ right yes sir this message is
[1:11:10] real to me not because some man taught
[1:11:12] it because I met Jesus
[1:11:14] Christ it's real because I know who he
[1:11:17] is so let me look here this last so Paul
[1:11:22] wrote this thing as you turn to Romans 8
[1:11:24] I'm going close out with that
[1:11:29] one why could
[1:11:31] Paul write this scripture with such
[1:11:35] impact with such
[1:11:37] Revelation because Paul had come to a
[1:11:40] realization in his life he could look at
[1:11:42] his life he could say if God did not
[1:11:44] love me this way I already have
[1:11:48] blasphemed yeah and he knew he should
[1:11:50] have went to hell right right Paul was
[1:11:52] not dumb he knew he said I have
[1:11:54] blasphemed right and there was no
[1:11:56] forgiving for blashe right Hallelujah
[1:11:58] other word and other what death was on
[1:12:00] death should have struck him down he
[1:12:01] should went straight to hell for what he
[1:12:03] done he he literally disqualified
[1:12:06] himself in the scripture by killing a
[1:12:08] person with the Holy Ghost had better
[1:12:09] for a millstone to be TI around your
[1:12:11] neck you throw it to the depths of the
[1:12:13] sea and Dr he left himself no way back
[1:12:15] right but
[1:12:17] love just like he did she left herself
[1:12:20] no way back but love Adam loved what
[1:12:23] doesn't work for Eve right
[1:12:26] amen I'm going to read this one here and
[1:12:29] this is the one we'll close with
[1:12:31] Hallelujah he spoke right here in Romans
[1:12:35] 8 I'm going to read from the
[1:12:39] verse verse 35 down to the last verse
[1:12:44] 39 Paul speaking from Romans
[1:12:47] 8:35 down to verse 39 here and I like
[1:12:52] the way Paul said it huah that was Hing
[1:12:55] going to cut that
[1:12:57] on man I was sitting there thinking I I
[1:12:59] hope you thank you bro hallelujah
[1:13:02] hallelujah that's all right Paul says
[1:13:04] here see the point of it is when we
[1:13:06] think about God love we put conditions
[1:13:08] on it sure we do right you know we make
[1:13:11] a mistake we say well God going to put
[1:13:12] me in hell I made a mistake God love
[1:13:14] don't work her that way cuz God love
[1:13:16] don't have nothing to do with the way
[1:13:17] your human effort is your human weakness
[1:13:20] if God judge by weakness everybody going
[1:13:21] to hell today without pass and go right
[1:13:24] right cuz somebody going to get mad
[1:13:26] somebody going to have how do you say
[1:13:27] but one brother I hear one preacher got
[1:13:29] up today and he were preaching a message
[1:13:31] I going call name he said if you had one
[1:13:33] evil thought today you're not a
[1:13:36] Christian I said well that put us all
[1:13:38] out right him
[1:13:40] too that's right him
[1:13:43] to you if you had had one evil thought
[1:13:47] today you know what that mean that mean
[1:13:50] that you are in the
[1:13:53] cemetery exactly
[1:13:56] that's that's when you stop having them
[1:13:58] in the cemetery so if you a but Paul
[1:14:02] said so now he he he he he bringing this
[1:14:05] love he bringing God love he not using
[1:14:08] human ability human effort how did this
[1:14:11] is the way that God sees you hlah so he
[1:14:14] he going to disqualify circumstances
[1:14:16] right CU everybody want a circumstance
[1:14:18] not to serve everybody want to circum I
[1:14:20] would have served God huah but I was dis
[1:14:22] I a disgrace yeah yeah I've been having
[1:14:25] so many tribulations in my life I might
[1:14:28] well to give up on God how can God give
[1:14:30] up on you right right his love won't let
[1:14:33] him give up on you am right brother so
[1:14:35] Paul says here who shall separate
[1:14:40] who that that's that's you that's me
[1:14:44] right tell the point of it is we want to
[1:14:45] put everybody else in it when it say us
[1:14:48] but hey I'm putting my name right there
[1:14:50] Hallelujah because I realize this is God
[1:14:52] love the reason I keep going Hall it
[1:14:54] ain't because I hadn't fail short and
[1:14:55] should have went to hell I don't made
[1:14:56] enough mistakes to be there but by God
[1:14:59] love there something on the inside that
[1:15:02] keep breaking you back to God that is
[1:15:04] not by yourself that ain't by yourself
[1:15:07] God done that work in you if you got a
[1:15:09] desire to serve God that is God doing
[1:15:11] the work you have not
[1:15:14] blasphemed cuz if you blasphemed you
[1:15:15] won't have a desire to serve God that's
[1:15:17] right Hallelujah he said who should
[1:15:19] separate us from the love of who Christ
[1:15:22] sh tribulations
[1:15:25] people I had a bad te ever since I hear
[1:15:28] tribulation coming my way that ain't
[1:15:30] going to separate you though right said
[1:15:32] tribulation or distress or
[1:15:35] persecution we going to come we can see
[1:15:37] that coming up on the world how if this
[1:15:39] thing the way this government going
[1:15:41] where this nation is going sooner or
[1:15:42] later we going to feel the persecution
[1:15:44] but remember we not ordained to go
[1:15:46] through the tribulation before they try
[1:15:47] to squeeze us up we going to go up
[1:15:50] Hallelujah it going to make the reason
[1:15:52] he got to put a little bit of pressure
[1:15:53] on us because we don't got too relaxed
[1:15:55] and lay out seal right and the eagle
[1:15:58] won't fly as long as he's in the nest
[1:16:00] right so the mama Eagle got to take that
[1:16:02] little Eagle fire him out and Shake him
[1:16:04] so he can start so God got to do this to
[1:16:06] get us out of Nest right and we got to
[1:16:08] get out of a comfort zone right and I
[1:16:10] tell you what lay SE and run even I have
[1:16:12] problem with
[1:16:13] it you tell today people had to walk two
[1:16:16] miles to be Church to be empty tonight
[1:16:19] in Africa they walk three one brother
[1:16:21] said brother Toby said they was walking
[1:16:23] in the convention someone walking 15 to
[1:16:25] 30 miles just to get there you think
[1:16:28] American person going to do
[1:16:30] that you better wake up oh
[1:16:35] goodness 30 miles to church yeah no sir
[1:16:38] buddy I I get on the internet
[1:16:41] Hallelujah that that American people
[1:16:43] look cuz we got so many convenience we
[1:16:46] got everything so here that we don't
[1:16:48] come so sof in other words in myself
[1:16:53] included I boy when I want a cup of
[1:16:56] coffee I don't want to go in there and
[1:16:57] take all day to warm up I put in the mic
[1:16:59] away you know I ain't going to go in
[1:17:01] there and put a pot on the stove and
[1:17:02] warm it up if I got a mic away I'm sure
[1:17:04] you going to do the same thing and so
[1:17:06] when persecution we have a hard time
[1:17:08] with this stuff sh persecution on famine
[1:17:10] or negative or the P of the soord and it
[1:17:13] is written for thy sake we are killed
[1:17:15] all the day long we are cting for Sheets
[1:17:18] as count for chief for the slaughter and
[1:17:20] all day long mind battles troubles in
[1:17:22] your way tribulation the devil fight
[1:17:25] over and over how it feel like you're
[1:17:27] not even worthy to be a Christian but
[1:17:29] you can't look at the way you feel we
[1:17:31] got n in all these we are more than a
[1:17:36] what through him that love us Christ see
[1:17:39] you he sees you Victorious you got to
[1:17:42] say well I don't feel Victorious regard
[1:17:44] how you feel right is what he said about
[1:17:47] you that exactly he says here and when
[1:17:52] Paul
[1:17:53] preaches he been preaching on the things
[1:17:56] know that I've been teaching on them but
[1:17:59] something in this 38 verse must have
[1:18:00] scru Paul yeah cuz now it's like he's
[1:18:04] not even talking to us himself got
[1:18:06] involved you got to get involved with
[1:18:08] your Revelation so now Paul get caught
[1:18:10] up in the Revelation himself Paul I am
[1:18:13] persuaded why did he say that in all the
[1:18:16] rest of his scriptures he wrote this
[1:18:17] thing com so real the PA I am
[1:18:21] persuaded it became his Revelation and
[1:18:24] once God become your Revelation ain't
[1:18:26] nobody you become
[1:18:28] persuaded that nothing can separate you
[1:18:31] Paul said I am persuaded that n need a
[1:18:34] death not a life not of angels not a
[1:18:37] principality not a power not a th
[1:18:40] present or not of things to come right
[1:18:43] not a height not a depth not any other
[1:18:46] what right preach shall be able to
[1:18:48] separate who from the love of who which
[1:18:52] is in who
[1:18:55] Lord this
[1:18:57] Revelation that God put in your soul is
[1:19:01] unseparable that's why we keep coming
[1:19:03] back what told us this that we got the
[1:19:06] truth what told us why this is true it's
[1:19:08] something Inseparable in our heart told
[1:19:10] this is the true Revelation how you see
[1:19:13] God you don't try to make it happen it
[1:19:15] just
[1:19:16] happens and the musici is coming
[1:19:20] tonight God Bless you that's amen amen
[1:19:24] amen

[1:19:33] these these guys didn't gave their whole
[1:19:36] life just to believe a
[1:19:38] lie that's not him so you don't think
[1:19:42] that Brother Sam just took some theory
[1:19:45] in a book and been serving God him and
[1:19:48] his wife till they H and turn gray
[1:19:50] because they love God right this
[1:19:52] Revelation means something to them right
[1:19:54] you see I see people when you come back
[1:19:56] year to year you just this is not a play
[1:19:58] play thing this is not a fictional
[1:20:00] imagination it's because somebody done
[1:20:02] found something real they can't let go
[1:20:04] of in other they just love him they keep
[1:20:06] loving if God take them home how all you
[1:20:09] can say brother say love God how brother
[1:20:11] je love God that's all you can say he
[1:20:13] held on to it until the end of the race
[1:20:15] right and the race was given to the SW
[1:20:17] to the but he that didn't do it to the
[1:20:19] end this Revelation to keep you all
