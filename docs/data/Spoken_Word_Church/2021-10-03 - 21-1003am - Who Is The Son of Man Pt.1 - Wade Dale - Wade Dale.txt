down your head and perish and know into space sack love and ashes unto him will thou be able to the lord and to let the oppressor free and that he break every hope is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring poor that are cast out of thy house when thou seeth the naked thou covet him and that thou had not thy self from thy own and flesh help shall spread forth speedingly and thy righteousness shall come before thee the glory of the lord shall be our reward then shall thou call the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall hear and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee seek the yoke of the putting forth of that finger and speaking vanity and satisfy the inflicted soul then shall the light rise and thy darkness [Music] and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fast the bone thou shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose water fell not [Music] if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure of my holy day and call the sabbath a delight be holy of the lord honorable and thou and shall on him not doing thine own ways not finding that own pleasure not seeking

involved and he's getting better and we're just yes hey man we're um we're just buying my time until he gets back up here okay man so um and i'd like to i'd like to read this quote i was thinking about it this morning in the smyrna church ages now they don't have it but i'm going to read it here for you it says all too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of god the recompense of god is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good treasures that are available to the faithful saints that are available the treasure's already laid up a little too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of god so um just admonish you that um bible study is really good for you it's better for you than anything else you can be doing on saturday night amen so um i i and i've always said if you have a position in this church you ought to be at bible study that's the spiritual leadership of the church so if you have anything to do i admonish you to be here i know we don't have there's times when we can't come but some of y'all have never come so so you know you ought to make you're trying to make an effort because god's made it available god's gonna tell you one day he's to say look i made it available for you why are you crying why are you crying because you've not come to adoption why are you crying because you can't get what you need to get well let's do what god says try at least try to do what god says amen so let's just keep that in prayer bible studies every saturday i mean the first saturday of every month from six to eight also children and young adults remember the bethel campus the 28th through the 31st we're already into october and we're also going to start announcing this that on 11 14 11 not 10 11 14 that will be november the 14th we will be having our church thanksgiving dinner here one service i'm not gonna try to fight y'all with turkey in your belly sunday afternoon okay one service on sunday and then the meal after that service and it will be not catered we cater the christmas meal we don't cater the thanksgiving meal so we'll all fix a covered dish there on 11 14 and also keep in your heart the week of thanksgiving church will be moved to tuesday it won't be on wednesday the day before thanksgiving it'll be the tuesday before thanksgiving all right so just remember that we'll announce it you say well it's a long time away well it's really not hey man october is here now too you remember so uh um we'll be announcing what's night service and we just got over announcing it just a few weeks ago i thought so we're going to speak today we're going to start a new subject i told you we were going to try to do this we're going to take our time but who is this son of man now we're going to have to we're going to have to background you know that we're going to have to background that's what we were kind of talking about in bible study last night we've had some real good background here so having good background here we can understand uh some of the people were talking about the statue of a perfect man and how to get the virtues and and you know sometimes sometimes i think remember god does it he reveals it and then he makes it manifest that's what the prophet of god said he does it so he's already doing a work in you don't think you're insignificant don't think you're not you know i mean it's a struggle we were talking about the kingdom of god is taken by force you got to press your way into this but in that we press our way into it we could be already in it listen how long was brother biscuit in that vision hours before he realized he was actually walking in the vision that brother branham had told him weeks before or a week before or a couple days before they start hunting he said to be a man of the green chicken shirt he took that shirt out and put it on he went hunting and he realized that he was already in the vision so let us i want god to show us that we either are in these virtues or we've already got in them but lord reveal to me where i'm at reveal to me what i'm already doing because he does it then he reveals it then he makes it manifest all right so he's got to do it in your life reveal it to you that he's done it and then make it manifest by you showing it out we were talking about virtue you know if you get a revelation today and you had a you had a question or you had a a thought that was contrary to god and then god gives you a revelation today that gives you that right there that gives you virtue and knowledge packed together because what you do it may it gives you strength and then you can what you can give it out to somebody else because that's what virtue is is strength not being a virgin and be a virgin every day in your life and die and go to hell but you can't have godly virtue because you got to have the new birth to get godly virtue amen so it puts you in the body of christ so just remember those things because that is the son of man right there that's the whole thing that's the headstone he is the son of man there he is there we know he came in the end time but we're going to try to walk our way through the bible because he started before the beginning of time and he's ending up now not ending but we're seeing the end of things that are being prophesied in the bible all right and and keep this in your mind that when we're even we talk about the old testament uh listen to me we thought we were talking about the old testament you say well that's jehovah but now listen all the old testament prophesied of the son of man it doesn't matter if it's jehovah or or or whatever you want to call it the father he every scripture how many scriptures did jesus fulfill he fulfilled all the old testament when he when he stood on earth as what the son of man so the whole old testament don't don't kick it out and say well when the son of man start well he started 2000 years ago in bethlehem no he started before the foundation of the world because we're going to read where brother brown says who is this son of man he says in the beginning in the beginning was the word amen so let's bow our heads as we get started just keep everybody in your prayers uh sister jim today she is uh um um our future daughter-in-law is having something um special at her church and she wanted they wanted the mother-in-law's there so our future mother-in-law so james at her church now with her so she has to do that so just keep him in prayer heavenly father we thank you lord to this day that you give us not just a day a 24 hour day but do i do appreciate lord that you give us a time of day to set aside the first day of the week lord to honor the resurrection and lord may there be a resurrection in our heart lord and in our life and the ones lord that are standing here before us the ones lord that are watching in father we pray that you will just anoint each one lord for our journey we're on a special time now lord we're in a time where we're coming into the manifestation of the sons of god and we're not going to be children adopted children to begin with yes but now brother brown says maturity mature sons and daughters of god to know what god wants done with the word not being frivolous and not being a baby anymore lord but knowing what to do with this word lord that you give us father we pray that you'd be with each one thank you for helping our pastor lord strengthen him more and more and more and more lord that you'll touch his body lord and be with each one of us lord touch the body here the body of christ lord the ones that are sick father the ones that are not here the ones that are traveling ones that are coming in and going father we pray that you just bless each one we are truly a chosen elect group of people and i pray that you just give us lord the promises that you've told us you would give us and today we are here to receive them in the name of the lord jesus christ amen all right let's go john 1 verse 1. everybody all right amen we're going to we're going to talk about the son of man but we got to talk about how it got started because what is the son of man bottom line it's the word made flesh okay the total now the son of man is the total word made flesh the headstone man not just us as a baby no it's the headstone man all right so in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god so they're not separate the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended not there was a man sent from god whose name was john now this is john the baptist the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe because see he introduced the son of man behold the lamb of god flesh that takes away the sin of the world so that was john's job he didn't come to he didn't come to announce the holy ghost he come to announce a man in human flesh that was going to take away the sin of the world that god was going to come down here and walk in human flesh behold the lamb of god so this john but now remember you got to keep them separate just like in the end time we got to keep these son of man separate from a son of man okay brother brown was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man same way with me and you there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light he wasn't the light he was bearing witness of the light that all men through him might be might believe he was not that light so there you keep them separate because john was not virgin born john might have been born of two good parents and he might have been prophesied that he was going to come but he was born in sin just like everybody else right he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now see listen the world in the old testament they had an understanding of jehovah because they knew there was only one god so they had an understanding of this jehovah person being spirit something you can't see something this far off and way up under somewhere but now it's telling us here he was in the world so somehow he got down here amen and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood we were talking about last night on my new birth not the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and then now john you can be seated john met that guy on isle of patmos right he was standing in the midst of the gold one like unto the white son of man standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks like unto the son of man which was in bride form which was gerd about the paps and also the bible study next um month is going to be about what is the holy ghost and what is the new birth so we're going to put them together but they are separate because remember you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't be born again and die and go to hell right amen so if you get the new birth it is the holy ghost but it's not exactly what that is so we're going to try to bring that out the next bible study so we love to talk about the word of god it's something that that the world i i was talking we were talking last night and you know we have we have a purpose we have a we have a motive of being we we have a where somewhere to go somewhere like like brother john said it's something we don't have to nail up anymore boards and we don't have to paint it and we don't have to keep it up it's never going to grow old amen that's our future home but see the people of the earth i was listening last yesterday after the georgia game yeah i do listen to georgia games sorry about them but anyway after the georgia game this commentator said i don't know what i'm going to do tomorrow that's sunday he said i'm just going to sit and and and in other words soak up and and and just take this great victory in and and i don't know what i'm going to do but that's what i'm going to do god wasn't mentioned nowhere obviously he wasn't going to church amen that's the purpose of people having life they have no purpose at all just a revel in the fact that they're team one x y z whatever well why can't we have the same thing when we come to church on sunday morning why can't we revel or or or why can't we say hey we've won we're a victor our team won you read it in the bible that we've already won it's not something we've got to wait till the fourth quarter the two minutes left in the game to find out who's going to win the game we won when we got up amen all devils in hell started shaking when we got out of the bed you need to start believing that that's what that's what that spirit realm is looking at there's devils in that spirit realm but there's also god in that spirit realm amen there's the angels of god that are helping you when you get up out of the bed put your feet on the ground and say thank you god for giving me one more day thank you god for giving me one more day see because the when we talk about this son of man when we get toward the end of it sure we're going to separate it but when we bring this thing together it's going to it's going to overlap into you we're going to talk about this great being and this great creator and this great person that we're going to talk about but when we get to the end of this thing it's going to all melt together and he's not going to be able to tell from him to you because the bride of jesus christ will be the son of man in the end time not one man but all together we will be that headstone amen that's what i believe but let's read here in genesis we know this is a c chapter and right here's where we're going to get we're going to read a couple of this and then i'm going to a couple of scriptures they're gonna back up now in genesis 3 15 now here is the promise this is god standing on the earth with two of his children that have sinned and the beast everybody got that and god at this moment is going to divide what he was going to do versus what he's doing now because remember he wouldn't all be saved he would all be he wanted adam and eve to produce the body for him to live in that's what the prophet of god said he was supposed to produce the body that jesus was to live in but at this point in time her natural womb was polluted with two seeds natural and god couldn't do that because her mind had already been messed up we were not supposed to come by sex we were not supposed to come the way we did but we had to in order for this eternal redemption that we've been preaching on for for months to come into being something had to fall for us to be redeemed all right because it was all it was always wonderful before and everything was fine and god knew this was going to happen but still he allowed all this to happen he couldn't he couldn't say well i'll choose this one i'll choose that one no he he let it play out by free moral agency by predestination we know that by foreign knowledge he had to let it play out because he had to be savior healer redeemer because before this scripture right here he was he was he had those attributes but he had no way to display them that's right right everybody got that he had the attributes he didn't gain any attributes prophet god in the church age book he didn't gain attributes as he came down here he was always the savior always the healer always the redeemer even when he was standing in the garden and told adam and eve he said if you eat of that tree you'll live if you eat of that tree you'll die well now he knew they were going to eat that tree but he had to give them the choice yes so that they could make the choice just like you do make your choice but there's a point in time when god says okay that's enough you broke your promise and i'm gonna have to do something and that's what he did in the garden and he didn't wipe adam and eve off the face of the earth he just said you broke the covenant so therefore you're gonna have to die as we were talking about the millennium a thousand years of the day in a thousand uh days a thousand years so god says i will put enmity or division between in other words what i was going to do if you hadn't if you had to eat off this tree of life this is what you would have done i already told you you'd live forever you wouldn't have any problems there'd be no death adam you'd rule the world and eve would rule it with you but since you did this there has to be a consequence because i am also a judge we love the savior and the healer and the redeemer hell we love that those attributes because it helps us but sometimes we don't like we got to remember he's a righteous judge also amen so he has to he has to give judgment where judgment is due so judgment is due here and like i said before though he didn't destroy his creation he just said from now on you're going to do this you're going to die you're going to chop you're going to bear children just like you are right now you're going to keep burying them for until the rapture takes place and i will put enmity a division between thee and the woman thee who the serpent he's fixing to put him on his belly the serpent is going to be gone serpent's not going to have anything to do as far as being the upright beast or the missing link he's going to have nothing to do anymore god's going to wipe him off and make him a snake so i'm going to put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed so he had a seed natural and her seed remember a woman doesn't have a seed so she has to be given one and this is speaking as the prophet of god tells us this is a great one of the greatest scriptures of promise that tells you that god's going to come down in a natural seed now he's spirit he's spirit but when he comes down into human flesh god has to create an egg and a germ and put it in the womb of mary and there is her seed she's given a seed right because remember even he says i was given another seed which was seth which was the type of christ coming after abel had died it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel in other words he's going to have to go to calvary and you know bruising your heel doesn't kill you right but now bruising your head does so the promise is it it what her seed shall bruise your head satan but now your that person is gonna have to go through sorrow and trials and tribulation and be made perfect you say the son of man yeah the son of man i'm gonna read you on down the road where he had to grow in grace and knowledge he suffered he became perfect by the things he suffered because he was in a human body he was a human being hungry tired sleepy brother brown said he could have had children if he wanted to have children he was that much man but he couldn't because see that would break his purpose his purpose was to get a spiritual group of people not a natural group of people amen but he's going to have to work through natural group of people to get the spiritual people because see we're going to read in just a little while that genesis 1 26 man that's before here that's the spiritual man that's the part we've talked about it many times but we're going to have to bring it out because listen that's where god began to unfold itself but he couldn't anymore like he wanted to from this point forward from this point back there was a chance that it could be by spoken word but now after they had done what they did by the physical there's no way that could happen anymore so god said okay i'm going to divide this thing up i'm going to i'm going to have my plan and there's going to be a human plan if i got that say amen because god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him what spirit and truth but i'm going to work because satan said if i can get them divided i can work on this group he can't work on that genesis 1 26 man he can't work on god no he can't work on god but when god put that inside of this flesh man satan said i can work on that right i can work on because there's a weakness there it's not original all right i'll put enmity between them the woman in between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise my head and thou shalt bruise his heel now there's one more scripture that basically tells us that god is going to have to come into human flesh to deliver a group of people amen now what is that let's go to deuteronomy 18 15. this is moses moses said the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of their brethren like unto me now what was moses a human being now moses was a human being right he was anointed by god but he was a human being so he said the lord thy god will raise up up unto thee a prophet you see that's a capital p because see the son of man is a prophet we're going to read probably later on next week or a couple weeks ezekiel that was like 40 sometimes god called said son of man son of man son of man what it was it was somebody in human flesh and there was a prophetic voice that was speaking out and that's the son of man not the son of man but a son of man talking but we'll get into that because sometimes there's a capital s and sometimes there's a lower case s sometimes it's talking about ezekiel sometimes it's not talking about ezekiel's talk about what god's going to do through ezekiel because he he decided once that enmity came he if he would have decided to do something different he would have went ahead and just destroyed adam and destroyed eve and started over but no he used that whole process with adam being fallen now in flesh eve being fallen in flesh he's going to use that now as an example to bring us back because the first adam failed so the second adam is not going to fail the seed of the woman can't fail because the promise has already been made all right so moses said the lord thy god will raise up literally a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren boaz being a perfect type of that from thy brethren like unto me what was moses the prophet he was a human being but he was a prophet right like unto me unto him ye shall harken everybody got that all right so now let's go to matthew we read this many times before in the when we were on the eternal redemption but we got to cover this because see you're going to have to separate it because you can't see the son of man in the old testament without seeing the son of god first now i'll we'll get we'll get to that okay because remember the the son of man jesus christ didn't show up until 2000 years ago in the physical form on this earth in this dimension everybody got that why are y'all sleeping already drink some coffee i ain't had coffee in two or three weeks because of my acid reflux i'll go to sleep drink some coffee don't drink no energy drinks though and i told y'all about that somebody sent me a message on email the other day and said i'll quit drinking my energy drinks i'm sorry so anyway when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men now let's set the stage here jesus has been on earth for about 30 something years at this time that's pretty long time how many of y'all are how many of y'all are 32 to 33 years old pretty close to boyd you're twice that plus so but janet may be close to that to that page but so who's nobody close to 30 years old i thought gaby you're close over 30. yeah okay okay you didn't have to tell everybody but since you did she's 32. but now but look now her but she's been on her 32 years somebody including her paternal parents or whoever the parent somebody probably should know who she is by now right they should know her they know she's married she's got four kids but they should know all the other little things and even ryan's been around her for for you know nine or ten years how long have you been man it's not a trick question he was gone 14 years then you know a lot about her cause the intimacy and you're there with her and you know her little quirks and all those things like that so what am i saying this man has been with them now he's only been with them for several years because he called them right he didn't call his disciples when he was 20. but this man has been developing himself on the earth he's the son of man now that's jesus when you see jesus that's the son of man so the son of man is talking all right whom do men say that i the son of man i am in other words what do i like what's going on am i this am i that because they're going to say and they said who's they the disciples that's been around him for a few years by now so oh some say you're john the baptist some say you're elijah because they knew elijah had to come before the but they didn't know who he was right really uh jeremiah or one of the prophets he saith unto them the people has been around him the most you see how the son of man listen let me throw a little point in right here a little bullet point and don't get me wrong but the son of god is a lot more easier to understand than the son of man son of god spirit god that's the holy ghost it works inside of you it ought to be worth it but when you talk about the son of man you got to have that in human flesh in its stature of a perfect man or adoption stages so that's a little bit hard to understand more than the son of god so he's on the earth as the son of man they think he's something else and even peter is going to say thou art this the son of god he didn't tell him who the son of man was he told him who the son of god was all right and he says unto them but whom say ye that i am in other words i'm not worried about them now you've been around me for a year or so who do you think i am simon peter said thou art the christ now the christ is the creator okay everybody got that the christ is the one that created the son of the living god in other words god made manifest in a son because i don't believe peter even before his conversion i don't because brother brown said the jews never believed in but one god that's why peter and them had a problem sometimes with that but the pharisees had a real bad problem with it because they were religious and they knew if he said if you call me the son of god or here i am the son of man they knew because of their spirituality even though it'd be wrong because they had their own thought but they knew that had to be god they knew if the messiah was to come he'd be god in human flesh and he would be on earth but they didn't like the way he came because he came different than their normal they wanted him to be this yes he came as this all right has everybody got that simon peter answered the dollar to christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven in other words he got a revelation from god and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church so what's he going to build his church on the revelation of the son of god thou art the christ the creator god you are the holy ghost you are the one that that brooded over the earth you're the one that told adam what to do you're the one that went over and and and you know did all these things down through the old testament but they couldn't see that that flesh there was something that they couldn't understand listen folks the son of man is a mystery that is the greatest mystery in the bible is to find out who that guy is amen and know who he is in his fullness not just know that he's well that's jesus back younger that's jesus back younger he walked 2 thousand years ago that's yeah he was a creator god somehow see that somehow he got back there and created the world and somehow now he's in human flesh no no there's a process and we're going to go through that process all the way down right and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou bind on earth shall be bind in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven in other words what did what was jesus telling him you've got a foundation of me the son of god uh okay right here and i'm gonna be on my church on that and the gates of hell's not gonna prevail against it but it's going to take 2 000 years come on it's going to take 2 000 years though for you to understand this guy i'm going to build my church and establish my church on the spirit of god entering in on the day of pentecost and coming in a spirit form and entering into those people on the day of pentecost and making them sons and daughters of god but not in the fullness the fullness has got to be in the end time everybody got that amen y'all sure made a lot more noise when brother andrew was here last sunday i can't kick around and jump like he does i'm sorry i couldn't even try we'd be praying for the sick me louis you didn't have to amend that but i'm going to give you the keys of the kingdom of what the revelation of the son of god the foundation okay you've got this part but it's going to take you 2 000 years peter you got to go through these stages i got to come and go inside of you and you've got to stand up on the day of pentecost and say this is that but remember this is that spoken by joel that i'll pour out my spirit on all flesh that's why you can have the holy ghost anoint your spirit and die and go to hell and not be a born-again believer because he said i'll pour up my spirit on all flesh but i see that what in the son of man that was the son of god in human beings but he poured it out everywhere listen only a small group of people no one when the son of man was on the earth the first time no one knew who he was they were they were in line they were getting there i'm going to build my church on this revelation that you were lost yes you came the way you should not have come but i'm not going to leave you this way i'm going to send you a comforter remember that's what jesus already told me i'm going to send you a comforter and that comforter is going to come and he's going to take you and rearrange that problem that your adulterous adam and eve had in the beginning but i had to come i the son of man had to come to be the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world i couldn't just you know listen why have you ever thought like this why didn't god just send the holy ghost why didn't he just send down the spirit and just go inside of you and and make you a son and daughter of god and jesus wouldn't have died because of that genesis 3 15. that's right there's a division between god and man just like abraham and or um sorry lazarus and the rich young ruler there's a great gulf fix there's a chasm there that adam and eve dropped down to that god couldn't just say oh that's okay no they broke the promise of god they broke his word from the beginning even being a son and daughter of god the bible says adam was the son of god and boy i went back into blasphemous names and and read that when bob was talking about it wednesday night i went back and read it i got a lot more out of than i read the previous 14 or 15 times you ever done that okay it's like they add pages in there and you and you'd say that wasn't in there before but see adam was a human being let's go right back to the daddy of all this adam was a human being right right he was the first physical human being now remember we're going to go back to genesis 1 26 don't worry because that was spirit man before he was put in the flesh but in genesis 2 7 there started the human race or the human people everybody got that amen and he was the son of god he had complete control and he did pretty much what he wanted to do because it's like brother brown said here adam you take care of the earth i'm going to go take care of the heavens i'm going to leave you alone you leave me alone i'm going to come down and talk to you in the cool today but when you call that thing an elephant an elephant that's what it's going to be i don't have to come down and judge that because you have my mind you have part of that genesis 1 26 man so whatever you say that's what it's going to be god didn't have a problem with that folks why should he have a problem now for that to happen he said well we don't need to be naming animals no but we can call things ask for things speak for things we got to come to adoption we're not going to ever speak people out of the grave until we can be able to speak and have things that we need amen i'm not talking about i'm not talking about physical things like temporal things but i am talking about healing salvation for you children amen sister hattie wright proved that she was just a little washed woman that was poor lady and she said i want the salvation of my two sons and god said you can have it amen now that was that was that was a son of man speaking but he was speaking under the authority because we're going to read in the bible because a lady comes to brother branham after the marriage in divorce and he says she says you forgive those people their sins he said is that too far off because we're going to read in the scripture in a few weeks in the book of luke i believe or matthew it says the son of man can forgive sins on the earth that's right remember he told that he told that guy that was laying there with a palsy he didn't say rise up and walk he said he said rise up your sins have been forgiven go home and then the pharisees says what do you mean what do you mean he forgive those sins he said okay is it better for me to say you're healed rise up and walk and go home so he was telling him he said what's the difference but he said you know he said i want you to know that the son of man has power to forgive sins on the earth amen that's why we had to have a glimpse of the son of man back here for marriage and divorce and all the different things that we needed when the prophet was standing here he was giving us grace it wasn't a prophet giving it to us it was god giving it to us but he was giving it to us in the form of him in human flesh i said a form because brother brown was not the son of man it was the son of man using a son of man to do what he was going to do in the scripture we'll talk about in a minute so let's read number one who is god all right so he first was god jehovah now what is jehovah god above us or or the existing one all right let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic light now remember we just read john 1 he's the creator and that creator was made flesh everybody got that we can't lose that string that we just we made a string now we got that string here can't break the string that's god that's all his attributes all right so it's not another person okay it's what it's an actor playing different parts all right we've been through this but i want to get this to where we can see because we got to come from seeing it's like i said before it's it's a little more easy to see the son of god than it is to see the son of man no i mean the son of man not a son of a man the son of man all right because brother brown said he's got to become visible among us not out there in us raise the dead and we're going to rapture because it's easy to see this it's easy to see that jesus died for my sins you see and it you say no it's hard well it is hard but it's easier once you see it to say okay that's the holy ghost and it come inside of me but can you see that that is developing the son of man just like it was two thousand years ago because that's the character that's why the statue of perfect man is so important it is the characteristics of the son of man amen listen we know god had patience and temperance and we're going to read here in just a minute where god said i've had enough of this i'm going to wipe it off that's what he said i've had enough of this i'm wiping this place off but when he came on earth he forgave those people through human eyes he gave them grace all right so let's now picture a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic light now listen folks as we said before this is a drama god never was a blob of light if not i mean if he was then you and i have to be little blobs of light because we were made in his image we're going to see that in just a few minutes okay everybody got that what happens is listen it's a revelation because when moses walked up to the burning bush he wasn't talking to a burning bush burning bushes don't talk there was a god behind that that was a human man standing there but moses revelation wouldn't let him see that because moses revelation later same guy same guy you've been talking to for the whole time he said he said oh god i'd like to see you he said okay go stand in the cliff with rock well what walk by brother brown said jesus christ walked by before he was jesus that was the theophany of god walked by and what the bible said was it was a man so moses's revelation was that's a burning bush but don't don't tell me that moses went to pharaoh and pharaoh says well how are you going to take these people out well there was this bush he'd been smoking something pharaoh said there was this bush and it talked to me no he stood there and he said the god of abraham isaac and jacob sent me here to take over amen that's what his revelation was is that he wasn't talking to this this bush he was talking to god in the bush that's the same god that stood on the shores of galilee before abraham was i am all right so look now let's make it a little white light so once you see the white light what we're doing is we're projecting brother branham is making a projection that here comes this light because remember you can't see god at any time so he's got to be manifested in something yes so why not why not a light because remember that's that same light that stood over brother branham at the houston coliseum in 1950. amen and the same one that some of us have seen before in different things it's the same thing but it's jesus christ it's not of life it's not just this light it's god in that light like a mystic light like a halo now what'd that look like on brother brown's head like a halo right and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning now now look that was the son of god remember brother dale asked a question 40 years ago put it up on the wall right here a lot of us weren't here and some of us weren't even born but he asked he said what do you think of when i say the son of god and most people said two thousand years ago no that's the son of man the creator god is the son of god that was before the foundation of the world amen look that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father now look it wasn't like god was standing here and all of a sudden what are those things that stick on the trees that kakedas you've seen them sticking on a tree and it looks like it's just a shell because they came out of it it's not like that god just moved over in another form so he could talk and we could understand him see look this is all for us it's not for god that's right this whole bible is not for god to show god that he's god the bible is there and the prophet's message is there to show where god is and who he is and what he's doing i thought we were supposed to see that which was which is and is to come that's god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning in other words he stepped down condescended to man condescending toward man or towards something so that we could understand that now that being is going to start creating he's going to start saying something and when he's what he says comes to pass that's the revelation or that's the manifestation of who he is remember brother brown said he believed his own word amen you know you got to start believing that too not frivolous stuff you got to start believing your own word but you got to have power with character not power without character because remember that's satanic you don't use it listen you wouldn't use it to harm anybody you shouldn't use it to harm anybody right that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god remember the bible was written before the foundation of the word world that's the word that's right the word's not just god saying things over and over again and this and that no it's got a purpose the only way we can understand him is by the bible how the bible give it to us is the only way we can understand god but then it took a prophet to give us the love letter part the in between the lines but see a lot of people tried to interpret between the lines and it didn't coincide with the top and it didn't coincide with the wa you know brother brian said whatever's in between the line has got to coincide with what the top is and what the bottom is in other words what is in between all right it can't be blue red blue it's got to be blue blue blue this has got to coincide whatever you stick in there has got to be the same thing as those two but it gives you a deeper meaning instead of just saying well the bible no it was god it was a human it was a person the word was god the word was what made flesh come down here and dwelt among us in the beginning was god and then look out of god came the logos a part of god that went out of god or the speech of god are something we can understand him more by as being the creator all right so now let's read number two am i all right we got to get to something here i didn't think i thought i'd be way short now if god created man in his own image now okay come over here with me open your eyes so you can see what i'm talking about okay so now if you got a halo of light if we're going to be if he's going to create something in his image whatever he creates he's got to be a halo of light if he was just a halo of light everybody got that now god created a man in his own image no what is an image when you look inside a mirror do you see her no i'm sorry y'all are twins do you see her when you look inside of a mirror who do you say oh why because that's your image we were created in the image of god the genesis 1 26 man and if god created man in his own image and in his own likeness look what kind of man was he a spirit man not flesh yet okay remember genesis 2 7 is the flesh genesis 1 26 is not flesh i mean it's not flesh yet right anybody got that we've been through this 100 times that doesn't mean you can sleep through it now if you'll notice i'll tell you something later now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation look and i want to kind of give you a little something here this is not going to cost you any money i was talking to a preacher friend of mine and he thought that that genesis 1 from genesis 1 to the creation of man was a spiritual creation and then when god put the 126 man into the 2 7 man then boom everything become flesh i don't see that he made a physical creation them pigs and dogs and horses when he created them they were in flesh because they were already procreating before god even put the two seven man on earth if not then the lamb that he killed and thrown into the bushes for adam and eve he'd have killed either the the man or the girl and there'd be no more lambs they had to be procreating anyway but that and brother brown even tells you it's a finished physical creation when god finished the physical creation then he put the 270 or the 126 man into the 2-7 man so that he could lead the earth i mean he was leading the earth but he could lead it by being on the earth now look but he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question we'll find this that god gave dominion of the cattle and the fish and everything to the man i told that brother i said how can a how can a fish be a spiritual fish and it be swimming ain't it happening and how can god tell them to eat grass be a spiritual something spiritual i just don't see that so anyway he called me back a few days later and he said i can see now what you're talking about so maybe it helped him a little bit but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle now what does he mean by up there genesis 1 26 all right he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beast of the field just like the holy spirit leads the believer today he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creations of god the first creation was god himself now brother dale's been through this we've been through this god didn't create itself as you think he just said that the creation was is that we can understand him a little bit more he moved over into another form so we can understand him better okay all right first creation was god himself because seething out of the out of god came to logos which was the son of god which i just told you was the one that created the world everybody got that started speaking he spoke to genesis 1 26 man the first creation was god himself now of god came to logos which was the son of god 2 000 years ago no 6 000 years ago or even further than that it's when the son of god came into being then out of god came the logos which was the son of god which was the word in the beginning was the word where it was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us look out of the logos came forth the man what man the genesis 1 26 man because the logo spoke and said let us make man in our own image all right have i got that so now let's read genesis 1 26 which should be the next one god said okay let us make man in our own image after our likeness let them have dominion them plural dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air i can't see a a spiritual bird flying somewhere this has to be a natural creation okay and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping land that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image so god must have looked right adam must look in the form just like god i said in the form just like god now what did he tell him now watch so god created man his own image and the image of god created in him male and female created he them he's setting up something here right and god blessed them do you know his children are already blessed before they even come before they even come to the earth see now that's predestination i'll go with you there that's the eternal part eternal security if you're in that part you always watch because that is eternal god that is him forming his children by the word of god born by the breath of god the prophet tells us in blasphemies names children god born by the breath of god that's why i could see where adam was a human being formed in genesis 2 7 and then god put eternal life in adam what he said in blasphemy's name brother dale's been preaching for years look adam just didn't get formed and god breathed eternal life into him no he was a human being first then especially into adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and sent blasphemous names that's a direct quote all right have everybody got that amen and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply multiply now wait a minute we're not supposed to be doing any hanky-panky right everybody knows how we get here now pretty much except for the real young ones you know how you got here that's not how you're supposed to got here but you're supposed to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and found the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth that's what god wanted he wanted people born by the word of god the spoken word of god from the beginning through here no sex involved that's why you got to see the serpent seed that how that's how it fell down to but god still said satan i'm way ahead of you buddy remember i created you i hope he says that one every once while i hope he loves the devil said remember i created you i hope he does i credited you buddy cause satan was standing here watching this the same thing lucifer was right here be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth because see that's what he told eve he said eve god told you to multiply god told you to replenish the earth look at all these animals how they're creating procreating because the beast was procreating also he had a mrs beast amen so god said be fruit but now look it's what god said now what satan said god said be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and foul the air so that genesis 1 26 man before it was ever put in flesh was supposed to procreate the children of god were supposed to develop let's just put it this way in the garden of eden under perfect condition god set this in motion adam and eve by the spoken word of god was supposed to bring all these children one right after the other ever how you want to say it i don't care but it's a spiritual birth not a natural birth natural birth is what's killing us why did jesus say you must be born again we'll talk about last night what's the first thing nicodemus said the great teacher that actually read this out of genesis 1. they had the old testament nicodemus was a teacher amen he said a master teacher you are nicodemus and you and nicodemus said have i got to go back and get in my natural mother's womb and be born jesus said no that's what's killing you now son you got to be born from above but he never understood it okay so now let's go to the next we only got just a minute here let's go to brother brown says let's close our eyes to our imagination for a few moments go way back before there was anything the great fountain of all eternity was that spirit of love joy that spirit of honesty that spirit of trueness in this perfection and then out of the existence of the father went to logos which was the sun which was the theophany which was the body of great jehovah in other words somebody we could see somebody we could see all right even brother branham said if you if you're looking at it it's like a father with a child playing at the door well he could see something it was an image right but it's not two people it's just god stepping forward closer to us so that we can understand him right right because how can you understand somebody that never had a beginning we'll never have an end you can't but if you can say through the bible and through the prophet's message that god was there by itself and then this halo of light went out or this revelation goes out and there's a man standing there and let's create in our image because i'm a man and i'm going to start talking and things are going to start coming to bend now see that's where i can understand right i can't understand that he covered all space time and eternity i can't understand he never had a beginning if you tried it go back 10 b there's not a beginning there but when i can see that he once started talking and i could understand because when he said let there be let there be let there be an earth we see the physical manifestation of what that word said because we're standing on it and we see it at night the stars the moon and all the different things so we see that that was great jehovah god went forth in a celestial body that's the logos that's a spirit everybody got that that's spirit form not flesh spirit form the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was god made into word do you know and i love that if you see it on we've got it right here and i think it's hanging up downstairs you see where the bible's laying open and the bible starts flipping the pages and when it does it's jesus stepping out of the pages of the bible and there's a human man because that's where he came from he came from that very word of god before the foundation of the world all right now but now what happened was there was a fall it didn't change the word of god it just made it more alive to me it may give more purpose like brother brown said more meaning and purpose in that he was a savior a healer a redeemer and all these different things all right so now let's read genesis 3 22. this is after the fall this is the way it is now i had to get us to the way it is now the way it is now man and woman gets together through a relationship and we have babies but then when you come to the age of accountability you got to decide whether you want to be a child of god or not everybody is that okay you didn't come here child of god you come here with a potential to be a child of god we were talking about that last night you come here with what representation you come here that god knowing that you would want it somewhere in your life you would want it because listen if you come here with something eternal in your soul come on i know the quotes we we talked about last night if you'd have been a bible study you wouldn't be standing where your eyes crossed because what are you going to do with salvation if you always was eternal what are you going to do with justification if you always if you came here with an eternal seed inside of you what are you going to do with jesus dying on cross he didn't need to you just needed to realize who you were listen even the woman at the well if you take the quotes of brother brown said see there that quickened her to eternal life there is no way now i'm not being contrary to brother branham i'm just telling you the truth there is no way that woman received eternal life in her soul standing there in front of the one that had eternal life because he had to release it she couldn't have got it before the disciples did how can a prostitute get eternal life in her soul before the people that uh peter had the keys to the kingdom she didn't so we didn't come that way she had to yeah it did the word quickened in her life she saw what god had already told her because remember she says we know when messiah comes she'd read the bible brother brown said maybe her mama read the bible to her and it quickened something she said oh we know when my son comes he'll do these things he said i am he well yeah that quickened something in her heart it quickened the desire to go tell somebody else but i'll promise you that girl had to go to the upper room to get the holy ghost you can't go contrary to the bible folks now you bring me 100 quotes i was the things i did in my life there was no eternal nothing inside of me it was all in the mind of god folks that's what brother adam was taking us into the mind of god because i'm going to tell you just like i told you before this is so simple god is a righteous judge if i get eternal life and i've already got it and i have to do nothing to get it and i'm just an eternal person because i got this seed laying inside of me but adolf hitler didn't now listen by predestination he didn't by predestination i did not by physical because when adolf hitler goes to the day of judgment when all things will be made known adolf hitler's going to say how can you judge that guy when you put something in him that you didn't put in me to me that's the simplest way to explain it we all came here lost we all came here brother brown said i was lost i would wash my car on sunday and watch people go to church i had to go to the woodshed or run down the um railroad tracks or wherever he received the holy ghost a prophet had to receive the holy ghost yes he didn't say something just quickened in my life he said no i had an experience one day i had an experience and i don't do the things i used to do so anyway and i know a lot of it's terminology but you got to really understand one thing if you just throw it out there and leave it that's what we're talking about last night you just throw a subject out there and just leave it then the people are going to get the idea that they were just something special when they were born and they got this eternal something that just stays in them and all of a sudden it goes i'm i'm saved no there's an explanation because you can't do away with calvary you can't do away with justification sanctification you can't do away with receipt why did what listen why i think i got it back there god after he was resurrected he meets the disciples and he breathes on him and says receive you the holy ghost now that was the word that didn't come from another preacher that was firsthand information amen now why didn't if there was a seed laying in there why didn't it quicken right then they wouldn't have went to the upper room brother brown said that was what potential they had the potential because god saw they would go to the upper room that was in the mind of god and i believe jesus knew it and he was smiling when he said it but they had to go to the upper room 12 or 11 days later on the day of pentecost to receive this lick of fire that brother brown said went in them why'd it have to go in them if it was already in them see what i mean folks just be careful we need to be careful and be not so much dogmatic but we need to watch what we're saying to people all right and the lord god said behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand to take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth out of the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man in other words he put him out of the garden and we've we've been out of the garden ever since that's right we're going we're trying to get back in the garden but we can't on this earth all right so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now that was to keep them away brother brown said now since jesus christ died and went to calvary and opened all this back up again they're running us back to the tree of life because he is the tree of life it wasn't a tree standing there it was god it was christ it was the logos amen genesis 6 5 real quick and then we'll close right here i want to get to something look and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth because we're going to skip all the way to noah because the bible says in luke that as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man everybody got that all right so now remember when these son of man was standing on earth physical there wasn't a destruction afterwards anybody got that all right listen and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart god's got a heart you know why because you got one because we were made in his image and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth isn't that what we're facing right now you know what we're facing when the son of man is revealed and we leave this earth there's going to be a destruction amen same way when the son of man was revealed to abraham we'll get to it tonight this afternoon when the son of man was revealed to abraham in melchizedek what happened to sodom and gomorrah there was a destruction amen and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping things and fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord that was one man and really remember now remember there was eight souls saved but that's not even talking about the bride enough was the type of the son of man and he was called up way before this okay all right so let's get into something just real quick luke 17 verse 26 and i got a few comments right here and it was in the days of noah or noe so shall that be in the days of the son of man that's us not back two thousand years ago he's talking about us because brother brown how many times did he quote luke 17 30. he said that's this day they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all now let's look and see though what happens here because it's it's a type of hair because it says in the days of the son of man so i mean noah is to be in the son of man now remember there were three types of people in noah's age as we're going to talk about tonight there was three in lots time or in abraham's time but there was three in noah's time the center that didn't care what noah was talking about right right the mate believer that hung around the ark and and them the ones that talk to no no are you sure it's gonna rain listen they were seven billion people on the earth probably seven or six point eight of them didn't even know noah existed they probably just heard a little something you know there's an idiot down there making a boat it ain't never rain but there were some people that actually got close to noah and said noah what are you doing hey there's nothing up there it will rain he said 120 years the prophet of god said 120 years god was so long suffering to get the elect in and only eight people were saved in 120 years of preaching eight people were saved and one of them was the devil ham brother brown said ham brought the you know across the ark the unbelief all right listen to this also yeah i'm done with the quotes that's okay listen to this remember what happened when noah finished preaching what happened god said go get in the ark right right and they were there seven days why seven days they were there for seven church ages there were seven church ages god called out a bride to save them and then god said i'm done shut the door now listen to this genesis 7 verse 4 they don't have it listen for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth 40 days and 40 nights this is genesis 7 4 and every living thing that i have made will i destroy from off of the face of the earth now what does rain mean rain means a message remember former rain former rain is a teaching rain ladder rain is a harvest rain see this day and time if it's as it was in the days of noah we get a seven seal rain in the end time we get a seven seal reign in the end time because it's coming to maturity that's the son of man that's why those two scriptures are connected why would it say in the days of noah as it was going to be in the days of the son of man as it wasn't days another there's got to be a connection now they didn't come to maturity but me and you are going to have to come to maturity to get out of here we got to have a seven seal rain something that's going to what harvest us off this earth and what is a harvest it's when you collect something and you take it and use it we're going to be harvested off this earth and then god's not going to flood the earth again because he promised he wasn't he's going to destroy it by fire so as it was in the days of the son of man we've listened we've listened we've read we've listened we're like i said before let's stand to our feet we're trying to do the things that we're doing just listen keep pressing keep trying [Music] as we said last night listen it's only human listen to me now you're going to have to agree with me because it happens to all of us when you have a goal and you set a goal like dave ramsey when you set a goal and that goal's been set and then when that goal's been met what's the first thing you do humanly i did it right last night i said well we just fold it you know we do this put the little straw in our mouth and we you know i made it i got the holy ghost i fought i know i got the holy ghost and then humanly we go okay i'm done no that just starts to fight that just starts to fight you need to press your way through that thinking that you've got it and you're done sure you've got it you're done your seal but listen god doesn't want that he wants us to press paul said press toward the mark of the high calling push yes make the devil mad i believe we have make you mad listen if you're a child of god he can't harm you unless god let's him amen so you got to put yourself behind the promises of god and listen see this son of man sure it's great to have the holy ghost it's great to come into the family of god and have the faith of god but you still got all that growing to do like i said before if they took little scarlet when she was born a year ago she's just a year older or the baby violet sorry violet scarlet violet okay violet's a year old now what if they would have all left a year ago buddy oh that we saw the picture oh hallelujah it's a baby it got here it's breathing it's a it's a human and it's a breathing human being now what if she took it and said well i'm done i'm done that my my job's done i birthed this thing mama i birthed this thing i'm done i got the baby here no that's just when the struggle begins everybody has kids say and it still happens even when they're 30 and 40 and all the way up that way so anyway but you know what you just keep going moms you ever quit loving your kids don't matter what they do you still love them god's the same way but god wants to feed you so you can grow up god don't want you to be a baby no more he loves that you become a baby because he saw that but he also wants you to grow and grow and how do you grow eat eat the word of god and you'll grow let's sing a song [Music] because [Music] i can face tomorrow [Music] because he lives [Music] i know my future thank god an eternal man holds my future [Music] not a job not a human being but god almighty holds my future [Music] he had to come the son of man so we can have life [Applause] [Music] yes i know he holds my future and life is worth the living yes because [Music] [Music] to release that life to give it to you and then we act any way we want to all my views no there's too many good promises that god give us for us to take hold of if you don't have the new birth please get the new birth you'll never understand about the son of man you'll never understand about the son of god but receiving the new birth gives you the son of god god in spirit form [Music] the son of god the new birth the holy ghost amen there's your promise but now he didn't say put the baby in a corner and just leave her there or him there no feed the baby do the things you're supposed to do give it nourishment give it nutrition word of god give it the word when the word's made available for you you should take it amen we've never turned down many meals have we we've never turned out many natural meals no we usually eat because we're hungry so let's be hungry for the word of god through this series let's sing it one more time and then you'll be dismissed oh because he lives i can face because he lives amen all fear is gone because i know i know he holds my future you're dismissed and a lie is worth the living [Music] because he lives [Music]
