and have our annual Christmas dinner and we're going to um try to get the right Reverend to get over there with us so you get to see brother Dale if he's feeling well and we can get him over there so just keep that in prayer uh remember brother Ryan said December the 24th we'll have one service 10:00 no Sunday school December 30th at 6:00 um be brother Eric gu and we have a change in plans on December 31st brother Luke's got something come up and he can't make it so we've asked someone else to uh um come and he hadn't got back with me yet but so I w't announce until he says yes so um it's someone you know but um remember brother Lis brother Aaron Brother Christian they're all Aaron's getting ready to come back here pretty quick and and I think they're having a real good time brother Aaron's getting uh uh he's getting baptized over there with a 100 degree heat and and um and all that so what do you expect when you go there I mean you know you don't expect cool days you're next to the equator that's where the oven is so same way we being in Jamaica you know the in Jamaica in in January at winter time in Jamaica it's still 88° but the wind's blowing in June when it's hot summer in Jamaica it's 88 degrees no wind blowing so that's the only difference in when you get into that um middle part of the earth the the temperature doesn't fluctuate very much so um so let's keep them in prayer that they'll stay hydrated brother Lis I'm sure he's he's been preaching double and triple time so we want to remember him so let's go to the Lord in prayer I know we all have needs people are sick and here coughing and and remember our community we've we've lost several people in our community past couple of days so let's just remember them and some of them really freak accidents so let's remember them in prayer dear heavenly father Lord tonight we come to the middle of the week Lord expecting something from you Lord if we wouldn't have come father I pray that you'd be with us now in the furtherment of this service take the active control of it Lord and you be the one that gives us Revelation father and I pray Lord that You' be with the ones that are sick Lord the ones that

that you give peace in our heart Lord just be with each one Lord in the furtherment of this service bless brother Louise brother Aaron Brother Christian Lord we know that they'll come back with many

Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated and Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word we um we had a good time Sunday afternoon I really enjoyed that I was it was um it was a bit visual but we had a u we had a good time trying to explain and we're going to talk a little bit more about tonight on dispensation but I wanted you to understand something when when we were talking about the water and it being the Holy Spirit you know inside that water that I'm looking at right here and you're looking at this it it's it's it has substance right you see that it's got substance to it you can drink it it's got minerals it's got all different things but inside that are molecules that you can't see but if you take all the molecules out all the water comes out so it takes all the molecules and that water that I was using the other the the Sunday the water that I was using see that's why we don't believe in pre-existence of souls we don't believe that we were something back there we were nothing we were a molecule in the mind of God we were we were a molecule part if God was water we were just a piece of that water but now that piece of that water is God the part of that water is God every molecule in this right here besides the outer shell hello besides the outer shell is God that water in there that's all water all right so that's the same way with God so all God was he poured into Christ and it wasn't that he lost his his fathership it just that he moved over into another form or began another dispensation and that's what we're going to talk about a little bit tonight heading toward the headstone because these are all dispensations all brother Bown said he was a dispensationalist and God is a dispensationalist will look at that in just a minute but in Colossians it says for by him were all things created what we were talking about Sunday that are in heaven Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him you know you drive down the road as as we're having our wonderful um overload of packages it slows you down just a little bit so you can start reflecting a little bit on what's going on outside and um you see all everything that was everything was created there's not one thing that you have seen with your natural eye that God didn't create now man put it together and made different things out of it but all the elements that takes for any of this you see plus you came from him all right so everything emanated from him and listen he doesn't make any mistakes so he didn't have to start over again now listen I was going back to that um scripture the other day and and I just kept going over my mind where Paul says until Christ be formed in you all right see until Christ be formed in you cuz remember you're a newborn baby in Christ you're not a full stature you're not the full as the Potter wheel would would put the glob of of clay and and if you walk by and looked at it You' just saw a pot just a glob of clay but inside that clay the master the master Potter he's already seen how much he needs needs to make his b vase so um so he's got that and he makes it and you know he don't make any mistakes but if but but we do right so our Clay is flawed because every once in a while there might be a little piece of dirt that don't need to be there there might be a a little clot I've noticed when we were a long time ago that the uh brother uh that Joe Craven and some of the different ones and our cousins I mean they were just they were just Masters in doing it but all of a sudden inside that brother George that'd be a a twig they try to run it through a filter the best they can but there'd be a little something that would that would kind of knock it off well they' pull that out and they' spack that thing they didn't throw the Clay Away they put the clay back on the wheel and started all over again and made what they were trying to make the first place well God did the same thing he's going to make what he started in the first place brother John all right so by him who him by God all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist now here's where we're at today he is the head of the body the church all right so he's the head we're the body all right now I didn't choose that you didn't choose that God chose that right all right God chose it to be this whole way this whole thing God chose this and this is where it's going to be and and we can't change it you can't change God's mind right you can't change it you that's why we have to as I was telling my my dentist today she was talking about a problem she was having with her kids and she said well I'm telling them this and I'm telling them that and I said you know I said just get out of the way and just you know back off a little bit they're 20-some years old I said you know Dwight Moody said said God will only fill those that are not full of their self I said so let's don't get full of ourself and think we can handle everything let's just give it to God all right give it to God and he'll never make a mistake he's always right he's always on time he's never off amen that's kind of God I serve and then if something does happen around me as brother Bob says wonky are a little off all right it's not God it's me okay cuz God's not that way but it's me but now what am I doing I'm going through these tests and trials to get over into that perfect will of God because to come to The Headstone you got to be in the perfect will of God Amen all right because Jesus Christ was the perfect will of God he wasn't he was wasn't part-time sometime he was the perfect will of God because he was God walking on the earth in two in two feet now he's doing that in me and you because he's transferred that part of him into us all right so he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead remember he had to die he had to die so you don't have to all right that in all things he might have the preeminence there's the whole thing we got to give him the preeminence get out of the way brother George amen get out of the away die and let him live for look so it pleased the father that in him should all F fullness dwell now look if it pleased the father that in him Christ all fullness should dwell then what is lost between there and putting it in us nothing there's nothing lost so he's pleased that in all the fullness dwell in the bright that all the fulls dwell in a bride all right to Revelations 3:14 let's this is our age and this is for us this is our as we're going to say dispensation right not the other ones we didn't have the one where you have a name that you're dead we already know that that happened and it's still happening now but this is today the bride age this is to the bride to the updated bride the ones that are alive the ones that are passed on they are not hearing this sermon right all right and to the angel of the Church of the L of see write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness now not that it was false at any time but watch what that word true means it's just like you take a tuning fork and I don't know a whole lot about um music but that tuning fork when it's a whatever it is whatever C D or what G or whatever chord it is if you got that one thing you know it sticks up like this and you hit it and it vibrates that's a tuning fork right and it's the true sound that it makes when you hit it it it's a true sound that it makes so that doesn't mean that it's false but it mean it means it comes to a tress or watch the beginning of the creation of God and we talked about that Sunday you and I are the continuation of that creation that which has not only the name and resemblance because remember back in the church other Church ages he says you got a name that you call but you're dead all right which is a father son Holy Ghost baptism or Jesus is the second person of the Trinity right but that was a dispensation that God said that's okay for the time but now when we come up to the the what the faithful and true witness here today it's the real nature corresponding to the name so when we because brother R and that always kind of tripped me up when I hear Brother R say they'll say Jesus Jesus and not get anything well I thought man if you calling the name of Jesus and you were pretty sincere about it then he had to answer but if you call Jesus Jesus and you're talking about the second person of Trinity right or the second personage of God he don't have to respond to that name right all right to prove that I'll show it to you in just a minute well I don't think I put it in here but there's one kind of like it remember when the U the woman was uh that got that Jesus called a dog remember she was a gentile she saids son of David Son of David have mercy on me son of David well brother Ram said he didn't H he did not answer her remember he didn't even it just like you wasn't even there right right cuz that wasn't his title at the time right but when she said Lord she entered into a place then it was a true witness standing there that she was corresponding to she said my Lord Y and her daughter was healed right amen so that's the same way with me and you that's why that you can have so much of Christianity out in the world and they're able to do whatever they want to now in the end time I mean I mean everything and still be a Christian right so that's not the true nature it's not a true witness the bride is the only true witness of God Amen all right the others are false and they may be true to a point because the foolish virgin is a virgin all right she's trying but she just can't get there but the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true genuine so in every respect we should know Jesus Christ more than any other Church age Hallelujah that's what's given to us we should know who this man is where he's at what his character is and where he resides cuz I'm going to read it to you in a minute that if you overcome in this say age guess what you get to do you don't get to sit on his throne you get to sit in his throne right which means you sit there with him and actually he's inside of you all right I think about many times Dwight Moody and different ones that that that we uh rever as and they are they were for their time and for their dispensation they were the truth right but the way they read scripture now could they read Revelations 3:14 brother Bob and read it just like we read it just now I don't think so no because the Revelation wasn't there they didn't have the Revelation actually Dwight Moody was a trinitarian so he didn't have that Revelation and he wasn't able to sit down with the Lord in his throne and not on his throne all right so brother Ram says look we'll talk about dispensation right here now when Jesus came to Earth he came in the name of Three Sons son of man which is Prophet Son of God and Son of David all right so now let me just show you let's just look at this chart just for a minute well let's do this because he came as the son of man before the church ages began he was the son of man right now before that he was Son of God in the Old Testament as Jehovah all right Jehovah right so that was the son of God that was the spirit of God that would come on to Moses and come off of Moses that would come on to David and then come off of David and then come on Ezekiel and Isaiah and all the different ones he would anoint them to do the things that they were supposed to do but yet he had he couldn't indwell them because they didn't have anything to to eradicate sin they only had something to cover all right so that's very Elementary but we got to get here somewhere Son of God then is the spirit of God that went through the went through the ages I'm talking about old ages I'm talking about the church ages in the Old Testament he went through those Church ages in the Old Testament and he raised up a group of people there was a group of people that was that was going to make it that was going to be the the Patriarchs and Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph different ones but they weren't his children they weren't his progyny they weren't his bride right they couldn't call him that right that's right he never called Abraham his son he called his friend right amen come on that's right you see how the scripture is perfect when it starts talking and but see you and I can see the difference in all that right we can see the difference in the as brother Dale preached many years ago about the capital letters capital l r d me God speaking direct from himself to somebody instead of the lowercase LD which is thus sayith the Lord coming from someone to someone else all right if you don't get if you don't know anything about that we ought to go back we may play that sometime cuz that's a really good really good U series he did on the punctuations and the and the capital letters there're there for a purpose because you keep reading in the Bible and you see this capital letter where it shouldn't be then you see capital l d different from lowercase even lowercase LD King of Kings Capital Lord of lords small then we get down to the end where it's all capitalized King of Kings Lord of lords which is all of us in together there in Revelations 19 it has a meaning to it like these dispensations like these like these name listen like I said before these names Luther couldn't sit and say look we're under the son of man Ministry we're under the son of man anointing he didn't have a I don't say he didn't have a clue he did not know what he was talking about when he even said son of man he just knew that Jesus called himself the son of man right all right that's well see now we know why though we know why he called his self the son of man we know why that he was the son of God through seven Church ages as the spirit of God back again like he was in the Old Testament but this time he was going to birth a group of people not just anoint them and then come off of them he was going to dwell in them and stay in them but see with that though now with that we can go back to the son of man again just for a moment right in the end time according to Luke Luke 17:30 the day when the Sun a man's being revealed so now he lived here on Earth he never did say he was the son of God he said I'm the son of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man if you look in the Book of Ezekiel it says prophesy son of man prophesy son of man because he had to come to fulfill scripture as a prophet Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me that's the reason he could not be the Son of God there because he was the son of man all right so we'll talk about this dispensation I'll read a little bit what um um about what is a dispensation because the word came to the prophets and he was the word look in his fullness all right son of man the major prophet not the major prophet but the god Prophet Ezekiel had a part each one had a part to play all right but he was the fullness and that's what made him the son of man he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and what did he do he fulfilled every scripture that they said about him in the Old Testament fulfilled it in the New Testament all right thereby with me all right well we know he lived in the Old Testament but it was when Paul would speak of him he would speak of him never said much about son of man if you look in your new testament son of man's not mentioned many many times except Jesus Calling himself the son of man cuz he was really listen he was the only one that understood right what the son of man was only one and really only one till the end time till our dispensation did that they said well he might be this cuz listen you can't make God the son of man and and break him up into three people right you can't do that but they look at him and see well there's somebody there's a God in flesh so they must be another God up here that he prayed to so there must be one up here one here and then oh Jesus stood one day and said I'm going to send a comforter so there's number three amen therefore he was the son of man why because he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all right no one else could claim that and no one else can claim it till now but you and I like I said before Sunday we're now in a many membered body but we have the same anointing the same Holy Ghost amen it's just in each form called a bride right all right in our names that are being called from that book of redemption everybody with me now for 2,000 years he's been known as the Son of God so that's the Son of God dispensation which is God not in human flesh his own human flesh he's now poured himself into a bride but right around the coming of the Lord he's got to come back as the son of man to bring back the resurrection who was resurrected the son of man was resurrected Son of God never needed a resurrection he never died but that son of man died in human flesh he died that human flesh died God can't die but his human flesh did all right died for me and you should everybody with me so look I got this off the internet must be true dispens sectionalism is a theological framework of interpreting the Bible look which maintains that history is divided into multiple ages or dispensations now watch in which God acts with his look chosen people I like that that was good I read through several commentaries this is the best one to explain what I want to tonight God acts with his chosen people in different ways not that God's different right but he acts in different ways so that you can understand it everybody with me on that dispensationalists use a literal interpretation of the Bible that's us and believe that divine revelation look unfolds throughout the Bible this is not a message believer but it sounds pretty good they believe that there's a distinction between Israel and the church praise God that's right because remember we have a problem well we don't now but we had a problem in denominations who is this 144,000 who is this Souls under the altar even brother Bram did for a little while he thought those Souls under the altar was the Christians amen until God showed him they were Jews that were given eternal life because of their stand and being just a Jew so now Christians are not bound to Mosaic law now you understand what I'm saying but that don't mean we throw the Ten Commandments out I know what the man's talking about because eye for an eye we don't do that our Revelations come up higher right right right right Jesus said you heard of all but I say unto you right if you don't touch them out here in the Old Testament you're okay but he exposed them when he come over here and he said hey you even look at them and lust after them in your heart you've done it already he didn't do away with the law he done what the Bible said he magnified the law and make it made it livable or honorable so Christians are not bound by Mosaic law which we're not bound by that we understand that because look I mean if we just s did the law of Moses we'd be Israelites okay and remember they're looking for a messiah we know he's already come right amen so they maintain beliefs in premillennial millennialism and the future restoration of national Israel which we do too and a Rapture of the church that will happen before the second coming of Christ generally seen as happening before a period of tribulation which sounds good so dispensationalism now brother randam they ask him he's on the future home now this is a real good example because in the future home he's preaching he's preaching a seventh day he's preaching on um seventh day of the Millennium and he's he's typing it as the old seventh day and everything's in the seven right all right they said Oh Brother R said you've run out of types that's what he this whole quote is is they said oh brother rown said what are you going to do now you've run out of your complete sevens what are you going to do now now you're a dispensationalist which I am and I believe that God is too so he goes on to tell and plainly reads that there is an eighth day sanctification or an eighth day over even in the Old Testament that types the future home not the Millennium all right the Millennium is still in time the Millennium all the way up to the white Throne judgment is still in time it's still the old seventh day everybody with me on that the only time you come to a total Eternal condition now not us we're already done before that but I'm talking about a literal Earth and everybody else that's on the earth cuz when we get in the Millennium there'll be some people that are not Eternal Satan's still going to be here he's going to be bound but he ain't going to be done away with when you get over into the eighth day I hope somebody sees this when you get over into that Eighth Day which we should be typing it now when you get over in eth day Satan's gone Satan's dead and and his little imps and all the pain and suffering and that's right that's why that future home I love that book I've always said brother Mark if if they took every book away from me don't give me the seal book The Church age book give me the future home that book tells you when you got born again it tells you where you going that's good enough for me and then I'll let God fill the rest of it in but I believe it God is too so we live in dispensations there was a um uh dad's oldest brother Marshall we were having a he asked me to speak at a at a breakfast they had and uh there was a young Minister there and he he started asking dad about um Martin Luther and I mean asked about John Wesley and John Wesley's the founder of the Methodist church and we were standing in a Methodist Church you know and you know and and Marshall said then we started talking about church ages and about this one coming and that one coming well here we're talking about Luther and Wesley and some he should know hello I mean you ought to know who your founder is right oh that ain't nothing got nothing to do with it that's just something Paul wrote I mean John wrote and and there ain't nothing to that at all there ain't no this age and that man and this time and all that cuz see he knew that we were supposed to be built on a man and you know Daddy said well well that's when Daddy said well I said your founder was a man too his name was John Wesley right so so you were founded on a man all right so he just walked away but we are dispensationalist I believe in dispensation of the Son of God I believe in a dispensation of the son of man also believe in a dispensation of the son of David but that's not to us that has nothing to do with us because we're not Jews so we have separated that part away from in the Millennium he is going to be the son of David because he promised the throne would never be without a son of David right that's right and he was going to rule and Reign the 12 Tri tribes of Israel now listen he's not going to rule and Reign me and you he's already done that down here that's right amen listen that's what the perfect thing to me about the bride is I think about the other day I'm going try to explain it the way I got it then what this the Bible is is spreading all this out Son of God Son of Man son of David everybody with me and then most of see then Satan will jump in there and he said oh you'll get it over there or oh it don't matter if you go through a little bit you know three and a half years of tribulation you you can get saved and then there's three and a half more years of tribulation and then you get saved at the end of that just don't worry about it everything's okay well that's the devil just keep what what do we do we procrastinate we keep pushing stuff back pushing stuff back no we get everything here we even get a body change right here so when you get a body change you're done what else do you need you just need to hold on a little while wait on the wait on the Jews to catch up come on wait on the earth to catch up we've already in it now we're in the 8th day by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are in our future home you're you're setting in it today cuz John saw it coming out of Heaven he said it looked like a what a bride adorned for her husband so all he done is he saw the millions of bride coming down that's right amen and that City just sitting on that Hill and and guess what brother Donnie you ain't got to get a GPS to find out where you going to have a house exactly no I believe you'll land right where you're supposed to right and then you'll be able to travel like a thought amen we have to worry about electric cars and gas cars and have to worry about OPEC or another that junk praise the Lord but we get it now though by the baptism of the Holy Ghost your soul today is sitting in Heavenly places your soul today as I've said many times before is an eternal person and it's in eternity that's right that's right that's right listen that's where you get Revelation yeah cuz understand one thing's for sure sister Alicia this is not the way it should have been there should have been no sorrow no death no pain no Agony but God in his heart he was a Healer in his heart he wanted to save something amen cuz he knew we'd get lost he wanted to redeem us so in other words for him to be that somebody had to be lost right really simple to understand the Plan of Redemption he didn't make Adam lose get lost he didn't make Eve get lost he gave him an opportunity to not because he said if you don't do that you'll live but if you do that you'll die right that's pretty black and white plain as could be do it and live don't do it or don't do it and live do it and die well they did it and they died but God knew that so he made a provision already he killed a lamb he slayed a lamb but the foundation before the foundation world in his mind and then he developed that plan down here and started in dispensation there was a dispensation of of Adam cuz there was an Adam a race of Adam listen there was a race of Adam all the way up to the flood till you come up to Abraham that that was not even a law come on there was 2,000 years that there was not I mean yeah there were sacrifices and yeah they were had laws maybe passed down from verbal from from Adam to to Seth and Seth said well now we need to make a sacrifice and and self s children says okay we need to make a sacrifice but they didn't have any there was no there was no promise in between those 2,000 years until after the flood then God steps back on the scene says okay all right hold on now you do this and do this and do this and do this multiply and replenish the Earth we're going to repopulate this thing we're going to start all over again but I'm never going to do it this way again I'm not going to wipe everything off brother George but by fire not by water all right that's God's plan it's perfect it's beautiful but we get everything everything that I'm spreading out that we're talking about everything that we look at a future home if you're born again right this moment you've punched your ticket right amen you don't have to worry what what street you're going to be on you don't even have to worry about going to any kind of judgment except the Judgment of the Deeds that you done in the body not a Qui thrown judgment and you're just what we're doing is is listen if God waited for 6,000 years for us to come to this place why can't we wait a thousand years for everybody else to come to this place like the Jews and the Millennium the the Heathen and different ones and then then we're just going to be there in a honeymoon it's not going to hurt us nothing's going to bother us nothing's going to uh we're we're actually uh standing in our future home but but there's a dispensation that God's got to get the Jews together that's right through two prophets amen they're not here now so I mean yeah they're over there but they're not preaching now they're not Believers now that's right so there must be a dispensation we'll get into that maybe a little bit later on we'll talk about the interval but not today we maybe a little bit couple more Sundays cuz we touched on the intervals this past uh Sunday afternoon but there's a brother B tell us and I didn't read the quote but I'll read it tonight where there's something happens something goes on during that interval well the interval the interval between us and the Millennium is the bringing in of the Jews right all right now listen you and I are spiritual Jews right we're not natural Jews we're not counted one to 12,000 to 144,000 and we get two prophets and listen they got a Time Clock they punch a Time Clock they got 1200 160 days and that's it you and I are Gentiles we have time no longer they have time times and the dividing of times they've got 1260 days to get this message right that's three and a half years but that's not really three and a half of our calendar years is 1260 days of the prophetic calendar which is 360 days and ours is 360 5 and the fourth all right right so that'll help you in Daniel 70 weeks if youone studied that that'll help you that if you'll get you to get your numbers right so brother said the other night he come in three names name the Son of God Son of Man son of David when he was on Earth the first time he was the son of man he could not be the Son of God now you can't you can't listen to brother Ram where brother Ram say God can't do this that's what he said he could not be the Son of God then he never claimed to be why because a dispensation of the Son of God meant that God was in spirit form and he was out over the people above them all right now the son of man is that that Son of God in a human called the son of man so now that dispensation of whatever the time Jesus lived 30 years and preached for three and a half years and then that went away right because the Bible says The Headstone was rejected yeah The Headstone was taken off The Headstone was the son of man amen they had no other recollection even the great Paul and different ones never really understood they called him the Son of God the Son of God the Son of God the Son of God they knew he was the creator in human flesh but they never understood how close that really is because they had that same Spirit they just didn't realize it because it the dispensation wasn't for them to get get it the dispensation today is for us to get it the there is not another dispensation except Israel so if you're a Jew you might have a shot but if you're a gentile when this dispensation is over it's done it's done for the Gentiles I'm telling you you when that door closes when that door of the Ark closed and man didn't close it no preacher closed it right Noah didn't close it that's right God closed the door right right he said get in the ark I'm done there's got to be a time limit somewhere same way with us amen he said he was the son of man when anybody would question him he'd say you see the son of man son of man now son of man is a prophet he had to come that way cu the scripture he cannot come contrary to the scripture that's why today our message now watch our message of this hour cannot come through the theologians and theologies all right what's he saying it can't come through cus right and Gia amen even how great they were maybe not cus but Gia and Nicodemus it's not a Nicodemus Doctrine anymore it's not a Gia Doctrine anymore we've come up to now to where we're looking at that same guy in human flesh that Ministry is right back in power again and that's what brother randam is bringing to us and as we we won't get to it this afternoon or tonight but that's why that door opens there's a door opens what the seals open the book opens you got all this open stuff over here in Revelations in the dispensation of the son of man amen which is right now our dispensation all right now look the Son of God dispensation is still going though right it's not stopping until the Gentile doors closed right but there's a son of man Revelation that's going to change somebody's body and take these people that have been under this Revelation that it went on and passed on it'll bring them out of the ground that's why today our message of this hour cannot come through theologians and theology it's got to come back to the same thing it promised to do it must be that way so we find out in this man he had to be a prophet not a son of God there he had to be a son of man now we explained that with the with the thing s Sunday so you ought to be able to understand that and but remember God when he as far as the church ages go you know brother Dell preached many years ago and even brother Brown says that that it's not an Abrupt end of one and a beginning of another all right so you know the first church Ephesus Church age didn't abruptly end on January the 26th that's my birthday January coming up pretty soon January 26 202 for January your birthday is in January yeah you're old though so we going to take that the first church age ended on January 24th see there I said 24th uh 2024 boom and now we've got another Messenger on the scene and he just goes from a baby or he just realizes and he starts preaching that's not the way God is God flows right there's an overlap to each age there's an overlap everything overlap there's a brother Brown called it a lap over but it isn't overlap same thing so one message comes and you still as as brother brandham came there was still old Pentecost that was in his meetings that made it they were born again Christians but did not understand the message of the Hour come on right but God didn't abruptly kill him and throw him away no he come on but there's one time though when he says hey that's enough so something happens that's why 1977 had to happen the way it did right all right because it ushered into a new a jubilee it ushered into a new time a period to where God's not going to wink it at the ignorance of the Pentecostals anymore he's got a bride he's got a mature wife that he's got to start working on all right but there is an Abrupt end to the to the Gentile dispensation because when God's done he's done with it but the church ages is just a flow one right through the other all right so the Son of God is working Son of God is working but right now everything's coming together as the son of man Revelation today not tomorrow today when brother Brown preached those seals that opened the revelation of the son of man it just took us 60 years to realize what it is but you know what God's not up there going he knew exactly before the foundation of the world how long it would take us to get it that's right that's why he that's why he's not nervous sister Rebecca he knows everything right we're all ner I'm nervous about tomorrow cuz I'm worried that y'all done bought a bunch of packages and I got to deliver them all tomorrow but I don't know that till tomorrow till I walk in the door but God knew it before the foundation world so he's not worried about it he knows exactly what's going to happen that's why we put it in his hands and let him take care of it s right then he served his office as a son of man now look he served his office as a son of man dispensation then served his office now as Son of God God is a spirit well now he served through the church ages as the Son of God so where's the church ages ephus smna peram th Sardis Philadelphia and laa and even lapping over into that you and I we're not in an age now we are caught out of that age and we're in the bride age all right now look and now in a millennium though he'll be son of David not son of David now because the sopian woman kept saying son of David Son of David he never even paid her any attention you you think he was rude but he was making a point it was scripture that you and I get to preach on to see that that he knew that he wasn't in that dispensation yet am right so he did not have to brother R said she didn't have any connection to him with a son of David you and I don't either see we can say son of David Son of David and he don't even have to pay attention to us but when you say son of man or Son of God and you say the Lord Jesus and you know he's both right and he's inside of you Amen brother BR said look it's the same man all the time all right so let's go to Revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice this is this is the loudest in church age If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him see it always even open door even if we have to open it right that's a door we have to open that's right all right to let him into our heart but I will come in with you and will s with him and he with me now watch to him that overcometh in other words to him that that has a victory that comes to a position all right will I grant to sit with me in my Throne now look the father's Throne is over here cuz remember he had to overcome to set on the father Throne all right it's not a real throne you don't have a father over here and three you got three Thrones in heaven I think everybody in the Bible knows one thing for sure it says one throne and then there's Thrones in the in the uh at the white Throne judgment we know who that is that's us so he will grant after we overcome this age will I grant to sit with me in my Throne not on in my Throne into intimacy see this is intimacy in the end time it wasn't that way back in the other Church ages and everybody looks at that first part says oh you need isab and you need all this and it's all a bunch of condemnation that right there wasn't given to any other Church AE my friends it wasn't granted the intimacy that we have that we can sit with him in his throne just as he overcome and sat down on his father's Throne which was he conquered death hell and the grave he took that Jehovah God put him in human flesh died for me and you come on somebody and then that's where he ascended and said I'm going to where my father and he's going to be on the right hand of the father remember when Steven was dying he looked up and saw heaven saw Jesus standing on the on the right Throne what right side of the throne or the right arm of the of the father all right it's just a position it's not people same person different dispensation different manifestation we know that but now here's the part that you me and you got to swallow where she is him so we've come to the place now to where all right he's not in a church come on he's not in the church there's some good people in the church if they attach theirself to the church is when they get in trouble right all right if they'll come out of that thing they'll have a chance cuz they didn't say come into her my people it says come out of her my people all right and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation look all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride all right it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride that's right because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him right do we really believe that prophet of God tells us what the Holy Ghost is given for us said look God's purpose we find in sending the Holy Spirit now watch now watch watch how he watch how he words this everybody with me that wake a few minutes I know it's hot up here too God's purpose now look God's purpose so it's not my purpose your purpose it's God's purpose all right God's purpose we find in sending the Holy Spirit you know why he sent the Holy Spirit he's fixing to tell us now remember was one purpose to send the Holy Spirit was one purpose and that was to get a bride under the Son of God manifestation everybody with me on that through the church ages but now watch and continue his plans through the church which now we know as the bride that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ now look out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ and Christ was the fullness of the godhe bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual as we were talking about Sunday I gave you all those different cups he poured into Christ and all the Crist was he poured into the church not into one individual but into the entire body there's where we come together in unity look we have power amen you can have a wonderful engine and you can have a 8 cylinder 10 cylinder you can have a 50 cylinder but if it's missing a one cylinder brother Donnie what does it do cuts the power right down to nothing almost and you sputter and you foul a plug you know that's not what we're in we're not in a foul and plug era all right we got to have all cylinders firing we got to have all the power we got to have the power same power that when Jesus stood out there one day and he stood in that Garden he said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me now if all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto him where did he just say he gave it to he poured it into the bride they just not come to the realization and I don't mean that frivolously they didn't come to the real ation like we have that we're him I see denominations pass off the scene everything else going I see God's Great purpose he keeps saying purpose God's Great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily cuz see look the only way we can understand the father cuz Jesus stood one day and he said You' never seen the father brother Brown stood one time and he said you don't see the real me right but to understand that person we look at the character we look at the character of Jesus Christ we know that who that's who he was he was the fullness of the godhead body because all those virtues worked in his life and he never preached a wrong sermon and look and then to bring that fullness of God had bodly into a people that he can have the preeminence you know what preeminence is pre he can have he can have the power over you before anything begins he has the preeminence pre over what you're doing boy we're missing it aren't we cuz you know there's a pre and a post there's a pregame show and a postgame show postgame show is when it's over with we're actually over here in the post game game show you know we're over here going uh what no he already wants the preeminence so when you give him the first when you give him the first control you don't have to worry about what's going to happen at the end the problem is is we take self-will on this side and not preeminence on that through the through the Journey right well that's my problem I don't know if it's yours that he can have the prence the oversight the leading now watch Christ The Mystery of God reveal now the complete fullness of the godhead bily dwells in his church the pinenes all that God was importing to Christ Christ was importing to the church look the Believers not the church the Believers then he comes and calls us bride after the seals break he called us bride one more thing is God in men the fullness of God in the godhead by L his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word now we find God all ages has had skin on it all right so God has had skin on it the whole time but he God has been hid behind the veil but what's happened false Doctrine has kept him from coming on the scene like he wanted to be right right Ephesians 4:14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine by the slot of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lying weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love now what happens when you speak the truth in love you grow up may grow up into him look in all things which is the head even Christ remember I told yall the other day false Doctrine hinders the Holy Spirit you believe that listen to this listen to what Jesus had to do Luke 8:52 and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not remember Jar's daughter I believe it was she is not dead but sleepeth and they laugh now this is God this is the fullness of the godhead bodily all right and I didn't find the quote but I'll find it later where brother Brown says he had had to put them out of the room because their unbelief cuz watch this they laughed in with scorn knowing that she was dead and he put them all out he put them out of the room and took that lady by the hand and said made arise so what hindered him all the unbelief around him is what hindered him remember he tells about going in the city and he had to leave the city because of their unbelief Ephesians 4:30 says and grieve not that word grieve is to make sorrowful to affect with sadness I want you to look offend to make the Holy Spirit uneasy and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption and offend not the holy spirit of God Amen and to make the the Holy Spirit uneasy yeah we can do that cuz we're still humans and he knows that and he's made provision so now let's talk about the pyramid just for a second it never was put on top of the pyramid why because when he said he was rejected and he said I go away and I'm going to send the comforter the headstone went away God in human flesh went out went over in another dimension but to build this Monument to build stature it starts out with the foundation stone of faith and then he continues on with all the virtues and he controls in the strength of every one of these things right in here I see I got in between all these Works in here little waves now the original pictures like I said before I'm going to try to find it because I know Daddy's got it somewhere he's got waves coming like this on the chart so that what's that wave doing it's it's coming this is what what we've been waiting on that's right is the wave we've been waiting on that wave of the Holy Ghost to seal us all in you said no I'm sealed yeah in your soul you are but not in your spirit right definitely not in your flesh but he we're waiting on that little wave that little thing to put everything together now watch he says look the holy ghost coming down now remember you already got the holy ghost in your soul so you don't have to come down somewhere to get in your soul if you're already if he's already in there everybody with me so he's bringing an anointing of the Holy Ghost this is not a new birth this is not an a different New Birth than you got to begin with this is an anointing This Is A dispensational change is everybody with me cuz your church ages are over the dispensation lay out to seea it's a dispensation change to where God's only talking to his wife right come on on right come cuz remember the wife is the only one that's going to understand what the groom says right all what the groom says holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a perfect say that word perfect what church for the Capstone to cap it off well you know what people say they ain't no perfect church and if you go find one the first time you step in it it's all it's not it's not perfect anymore I said that but he said a perfect church not perfect in that everybody agrees 100% with the color of the walls you know but you better agree in Doctrine you better not have your own own idea cuz your own idea that don't even sound right to God your own idea I thought we had to get rid of them and get his idea all right and he's not he don't have ideas he has truth now look what happens next then comes the Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost still the church got smaller in the minority and now it goes on till that has to get to such a perfect place he keeps saying the word perfect until when that headstone finally comes now watch it'll fit so perfect the church will be have to be in such a perfect shade here said it three times in two sentences plus the other quote before until when Christ comes he fits right into it so you see just speaking in tongues dancing in the spirit that's way down the line here yet and remember if you was ever there in Egypt the spank talking about the stones you put a razor blade between them hone to a perfect condition till it fits perfect that's the way the church is going to have to be so hone down the word honing the church until when Christ comes to take the church the ministry the church will pick right up on it and raise Luther Wesley Pentecost and all and go up with that with it to take the church up Ephesians 4:15 but speaking the truth and love make grow up into him in all things we just read this a minute ago which is thee even Christ so let's continue though from whom the whole body fitly joined together there's that fit part again fitly joined together and compacted brother George compacted that means you as we were just in Gainesville just a little while ago before dark they was out there working on a on a line some kind of water line or something and they had one of them compactors that guy was going toop up it going well what was he doing he was compact in that soil down to where you know if you just throw dirt in it and two days later or two weeks later it started raining you're going to have a what you going to have a hole but he's compacting it down to where nothing else can get in there and that's what God's doing to us amen he's he's cinching up all the holes that's what the holy spirit is doing when he comes down and it's going to it's going to just bathe us amen you going to have problems sure going to have trials sure but you can know how to handle them and I've always said the Holy Spirit doesn't take away your problems right but it teaches you how to handle them right and you know what it does too it shortens them yes if you'll let the Holy Spirit if you'll let him lead it will shorten your problem I was talking to a girl today at work um her sister had a son died and it's been a long time ago and there some point in time where you know you you if you're a born again Christian you got to say that had to be God that did that he knew what was right he knew every part of that was right he knew why he was taking that young man he knew all that just leave it to him and leave it alone and let your trial be this short not a lifetime long some people can't let go of a lifetime of stuff right come on we know those people but they're not true Born Again Christians I'm promising you you there's somewhere you got to lay it down and say God that's yours I believe you're perfect I believe I'm your child I believe it had to be for the best I believe this is the only way it could happen that's right exactly if not God would have done it a different way CU remember God's the only one who can take you they me and sister Anna Canard was talking about you know you can shorten your life you can go walk out and stand in the in the middle of the road brother John and few minutes later we'll hear this crash and somebody down one1 but but you're not going till God tells you you're going so when he takes you that's perfect that's right do we really believe that that's right you know the old saying is you know he went before his time no he didn't go before his time there was only one problem with a man in the in the Bible in the Old Testament they wanted to lengthen his life and you see what that got him right he should have went when God said it's time for you to go right so let's just let but but to me that satisfies anything inside of us it just keeps something lingering and eating at you and and let that thing go there's not one more thing you can do about it and like I said before if we know God's perfect we know he don't make a mistake we know he does everything for our good that's what he said right and he'll never put on you more than you can stand that's right am I reading scripture he's telling that directly to his bride if something happens in our life we just say though God slay me yet I'll trust him like brother Brown said he said whatever Lord my kids's dying my wife's dead the Lord give us the Lord take us away blessed be the name of the Lord amen this I say before therefore and testifying the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their un the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance now look through the ignorance that's in them stop theirself from going on with God by the ignorance that's inside of us because of the blindness of their heart now look brother Mar look these fellas wasn't required what these Fells are dispensation this wasn't required what this was now I do believe and you and I we all know and believe that that every promise and every um and every woe in other words you might say another another one 2 3 4 5 seven Church ages we get their blessings but we also get their curse but we're the Life Church age we're over here at the very end all right and you still hadn't done away because over way over here in the first church age he said you've left your first love well that's the same away with today oh yeah sure right right then he says you got a name you call but you're dead then all these different things well well that didn't go away in that church age right it just kept flowing through to here so everything's piling up here that's right even brother R said in the Dark Ages The Same Spirit that o spirit for them to overcome and to just walk into a lion's den and walk into a a gladiator's uh ring and give their life for God he said you need that every day to get through your life well yes yeah you do how many lines is out there ready to kill you now the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true see now he's back to that word true in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now remember that word true the real nature corresponding to the name in other words what I'm trying to get you to see dispensational changes amen that's right dispensations must correspond with the real genuine that's going on in that period of time right with me yes I I'm not looking for Jesus to Walk on the shores of Galilee again right right in this in this dispensation I want him to see him in yours walking your feet that's our dispensation there was a dispensation when yes sir he walked on the face of the Earth and he walked in uh Sho leather he ate he lived with a group of people but now that's not that dispensation anymore this dispensation is he's alive in you and me the same way without restrictions come on he has been under restrictions during these other dispensations right right this is the dispensation of the son of man amen then you get all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind of things look then the Holy Ghost comes upon him now many people in the message take that quote right there and they believe that you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost until you all the way up here where it says holy spirit I I I personally listen to them talk about it just because of this quote says when a man possesses these kind of things the virtues then the Holy Spirit comes look it doesn't come in him it comes upon you I look at words right in and on Lord's Prayer says in Earth not on Earth that's right in Earth as it is in heaven in Earth Glory this Earth I'm not worried about I listen if this Earth don't get changed this one surely will not right exactly so the whole world's waiting groaning as I said before waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God not manifestation of trees they'll change when we change amen cuz they got lost when we got lost right then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak in tongues you might impersonate any gift look that God's got but until these virtues here go into you now they Ed the word into brother George you're still off the real true there's that true again True Foundation of faith but when these virtues grow in and you added that to that then you are a living Monument you're a living moving Idol greatest battle ever fought brother Ram says look open up them flu of the soul and body senses conscious that's that's the spirit realm and just let God's word penetrate first right preeminence pre let God's word penetrate first take that mind that's why I said every listen everything's got an order we know that right that's why we have church order all right that's why I said about coming in here late for church you comeing here late for church you got everything on your mind that's right if you'll settle down for about 20 minutes and just pray read your Bible listen to what brother rown says but you come walking in here 10 minutes after Bob's been speaking no you ain't going to get nothing you've lost 10 minutes of an ET Eternal speech right exactly oh that's too much I thought the word was eternal and if somebody brought it and made it Eternal too but there's your Battleground open up that mind that's the Battleground that's where the battle sets in Array right here in the front line your mind that's why I told about brother Ryan saying that the devil set on his shoulder I wished he was sitting right there I could flick him off but he's right here and I something I can't knock it out yet I'm sorry I have that problem if y'all don't have that problem pray for me right here the front line is your mind open it up look every doubt I doubt my doubts one more time every doubt I doubt my doubts so every doubt he has he doubts that doubt that he had do we do that no you know what we do we keep piling up doubt and fear goes together you know that right I'm believing God's word here I come Satan something is going to take place sure it will yes sir now we looked at this in the interval would just 8:30 will I tell you what let's stop magicians come on but I want to read what brother R said about the interval and then we'll get we'll start on it maybe Sunday for a little bit Brother D you don't be doing that we'll be okay people oh need they're already asleep now so I'm just going to let them get home now we know that's okay I know we're human but we notice this interval now between the sixth and seventh chapter now the seventh chapter of Revelation look reveals a happening now remember Revelation chapter 6 is Seal 1 through six right Revelation 7 is not the revelation of a seal it's the bringing in the 144,000 then the seventh seal takes up in Revelations 8 everybody with me now look we notice this interval now between the sixth and seventh chapter now the seventh chapter of Revelation reveals a happening it's not in here just for nothing it's not put in between this for nothing right it is here for a purpose right and it's a revelation that reveals something we'll keep getting into that a little bit more notice how mysterious and mathematical it fits right in the scripture exactly you believe in God's mathematics if you don't you're sure lost in the you'll sure get lost in the word if you start putting a four or six or something besides just the mathematical words running in order you'll sure have in your scene a cow picking grass in the top of a tree somewhere you certainly run out because God does not his whole word does not run look it it run completely in mathematics it doesn't run completely and he say in in mathematics perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it so perfect in mathematics and that's that interval that we've been talking about Matthew 24:4 he preach six seal go to Matthew 24:32 it stops and there's an interval there's a calling in of some of of a group of people but we're going to look at that in a spiritual sense a little bit a little bit later then Matthew 24:36 to 44 picks right up with the seventh seal and he talks about the son of man then you look at what brother rown said look The Sixth Seal produce itself seventh seal brings him back to Earth and we'll talk about that a little bit but there had to be that interval and when we get into the seals which we're going to get started in the seals because you have to preach the seals if you preach the son of man y because he is the seal and everything about him was the Seals All right so you got to preach on them so we're going to preach on them again for the second or third time but we're going to maybe approach it at a little bit different angle if that's all right but remember Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand and sat down as in Revelations 5 Revelations 5 claimed what he owned what he had redeemed that's right it's always been that third pull three is perfection now for some of you young ones that don't know what third pull is we'll cover that too cuz that's in the son of man Revelation all right there was no such thing as three pulls in the in the first age second age third age fourth age fifth age this is all something that come out of all those ages that's right and it was specific to brother brandham but he gave it to us all right CU remember the third pool are the totally lost the bride and the church the ministry comes to its Perfection What when the third pole happens when that thing comes to The Headstone we come to Perfection when it's when it reproduced Christ again in natural look in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of light let's stand at our feet just think on these

questions and answers and then seventh seal and then he preached six Church ages and had 10 preached 10 virgins and 144,000 kind of strange and then he had preached on the seven Church a so there's
