ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved okay let's go to romans 8 29. we'll read 28 while you're getting 28. uh and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called then he also justified me and whom he justified them he also glorified okay we'll go over to pick up verse 11 just pick up verse 2 god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew because see we're going to be dealing with foreknowledge for no for knowledge for new all right what ye not that the scripture saith isaias that he that maketh the intercession of god against israel saying um okay you can be seated and we just get on into the part because we're wanting to stay with the subject because i want you to and i'm going to just do slow reading today to try to end this up because i want you to make sure that you know we've got some visitors coming in and also you know i think they've been here before but anyhow no one has but good to see you amen but welcome all right now i want you to understand where i stand because of what i believe because you know uh that's the best way to say it i don't know you say well are you right or wrong no i try to be right but the word is right that's the part that's right is the word so then if we stay with the word then we have to be staying with the right understanding and everything will will be in the correct order but i want you to to just keep in your mind one thing you say well brother dale do you believe in predestination all right now i'm going to say this over and over and over i believe in predestination by for knowledge all right so now we're going to read these because sometimes i don't read them in things and i just leave it but i'm going to read through them and at least that way you will know what the prophet has said what the bible has said and you'll know that that's what i believe i believe that those who he that he does not predestinate will read by his desires no right if anything he'd be predestinating by your desires amen because he can look and see him but that's what we want to stay with the point he said well what do you believe i believe in foreknowledge knowledge before which comes first then amen which comes first predestination or knowledge for knowledge comes first then he predestinates by that so that's i want that in your mind i want that dwelling within us and then because see there's another message coming on behind this that uh we must get into and i ask you to read or listen to christ is the mystery of god revealed and we'll get in there where that god had a plan and a purpose all right we want to get into that part because then you're going to see predestination move into a little bit of a different avenue maybe than what you generally think of it even by reading that for knowledge and predestination we're going to roll we're going to roll into god's mind and see if we can can be able to understand so read the message or listen to christ is the mystery of god reveal all right so that way you'll have it in your understanding so which comes first now predestination no for knowledge now listen to my point if you think that predestination comes first then you're predetermined now now listen what i'm saying then once you read here what the prophet says that ain't right then you're gonna you're gonna go when he said i don't believe in you know in this i don't believe in that i don't believe that he's he predestinates the way we think so see now if you bring it in the correct order see then you'll get it to where you can see the foreknowledge as that will go us back as far as can go predetermined is going that away [Music] you know a destiny determined to go to all right so then that way you'll understand and you won't be doing but if you go to predestination first now everybody listening you go to predestination you say well i'm a firm believer in predestination i believe we're this predestinated seed we'll get into that i believe in that but i believe as the prophet said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it's the word or seed or i believe that just as much as i believe that he predestinates by his foreknowledge because that's the only way i can get it together and keep it together to where i can conceive because if not if predestination comes first then your destiny is determined you would not have anything to do with it it would be predetermined but if you go to foreknowledge amen see faker predetermined but let it be that he foreknew and then he could set the destiny because all mankind it doesn't matter who there is a destiny set for everybody now that's that's not a predestination of a presbyterian or a baptist or whatever that is that's not that away not thinking on that well is it this is i can't do nothing about it well if that's what you think you can't do nothing about it i'll agree with you if you say i can't do nothing about it god determined my destiny no no god didn't determine your destiny you determine your destiny all right see then that way we'll hold it to the line to where we can walk with the word of god okay so let's start reading a few things that the prophet had to say and like i said i want to read them and i want you to listen and and just pay close attention as to what is being said go ahead number one which is on the message the super sign these are the notes that you'll look you'll see that we've given these about three times in a row but i want you to listen i want you to read and listen and see what he says and then the prophet is the one the word came to so it didn't come to me in you we had it all messed up everybody's right all right we had a predestination it was like well i'm glad i fell off of that thing i got that over with now i don't have to do that no more see that's our we try to make it some silly form of a predetermining just listen to what i said if you go to predetermining first then you're believing in pre-existence you would have to be if you go to predetermined first you go to four knowledge first then a destiny says you're not pre-existent right right all right so if you want to believe in pre-existence what do you believe i believe now listen i believe in a pre-existence of a predestinated seed right yes but that's the word amen i believe in a predestinated word i believe each age has a word laid down for that age i believe that because that's and it's predetermined to be there but what was it predetermined by before knowledge that he knows what we'll have nato [Music] all right see then we we've got the whole thing but it's right the way the listen to the prophet like a brother said the other day he said i don't see a hand in the world anybody can think about it said it's just so simple to me i said well that's that's what i think it's simple to me god knows if he doesn't know he's not god all right that solves that but if he predetermines in any other form then by his foreknowledge then he's a respecter person and he doesn't do that right okay so now let's get with the with it and go from the message superstar god knowed the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory and we'll get back to god's plan and purpose on the christ the mystery that so listen to that right there and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes god is making everything you know what the clock is ticking just exactly on time sometimes we get weary upset we get hastily we think oh we must do this or do that but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for before knowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his knowledge god doesn't predestinate by his desire he is not willing that any should perish but by his foreknowledge okay now that solves the problem he's not willing he's not predestinating by his desires well you're just in the old days of predestination we're up in this fancy revelation for the hour well okay do what you want to i'm i'm just stating what i believe and that'll be left at that all right now watch then he is not willing that any should perish see if he pre-predestinated before he before knowledge he would be predetermining and see it won't work okay keep that in mind now as we go along he is not willing that any should perish but by his knowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew that this would be our day he had plans for this day he had had plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he is always on time okay all right now see we're going to get down when we we get back on to that of uh you know we'll get back to the scripture that we read where he's the predestinated sure he predestinates a group of people he sure does but it's by therefore knowledge right now he said but i don't have anything to do with my salvation brother dale because you proved it and put in there and said that we didn't choose him he chose us well that's true he chose us but is there any problem with choosing for his foreknowledge that he chose us because he knew we'd choose him any problem with that well then is he watching what we're doing yeah and see we think we'll get to it in a minute that he just puts us in a pot and pushes us through the other end of it well if he does that's predetermining everything it's not giving you a choice right i believe you have a choice you must accept jesus christ as your savior if you don't accept him as your savior then you're the one that's got the problem so you're predetermining god's not he gives you a choice all right make your calling an election sure go ahead number number two because this is romans uh 11 32 for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that you might have mercy upon all now i brought that in because of the purpose of starting this this situation up to where most people think oh we're this special chosen people we're just and and we're not like them that old serpent seed can't be saved that old group that's the you know uh-uh god had concluded all right that's right amen and unbelief that he might have mercy upon all right any problem with that okay go ahead with number three which is from the message of god's covenant with abraham and his seat jesus didn't come to calvary just for a haphazard thought well i'll die there perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me that's my brother he's a methodist minister and that's what he says he says god looked down and everything failed and said finally he said okay i'll just send my son let him die maybe somebody will accept it well boy that's i mean you know i told him i said uh i'd like to talk to you about an eternal god who has had never changed his mind amen but anyhow listen he said maybe you'll feel sorry and come down and get saved no no god don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that jesus come for the one specific purpose that was to redeem those that god foreknew would be redeemed solve the problem now god's not willing that any should perish i read a lot of do quote that and stop don't read this hearing that's the sign i was looking at i said i'm going to read every one of them word for word you know the whole thing amen god's not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but in order to be god he had to know see he knew when he created mankind that we'd fall but that's part of his plan and purpose he had to have these attributes of savior healer etc but he knew well then he didn't give us a choice didn't give us a choice he put us here gave us a choice that's where i believe it you may doubt it whatever you want to do i believe cain had just as much a choice as abel did yes because if you don't make him with a choice you've got a problem amen yeah but god loved this one he loved me and he didn't love these others i'd hate to put it on thinking he loved me for something some work god's not willing that he should perish but all would come to repentance but in order to be god he had to know now the word predestinate it is used in ephesians 1 5 predestinate there isn't a good word because now this is the reason it means in speaking of predestination to the people sometimes leads them to think that god just predestinated you to push you through a little pipe or something that's what predestination of mankind runs to that's not what the prophet believed and that's one up not what i believe okay push you through the pipe or something that's not right predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny now back to me means that away so you're going back to foreknowledge and destiny goes out in the front ways of you and there's a destiny set for all of us right god knew it and he didn't make us amen he made us with a free moral agency and he cannot override your free mortality yeah but look at paul he got nazi that's your old calvinistics and armenian doctrines and ideas coming down see they think oh paul will paul didn't have to do it god just knocked him down slapped him off without saved him anyway he slapped him down he knocked him around but he still had the choice you thank god for the choice what i'm trying to get you to see now if you don't get nothing out of the message i told you the other week that we would be one thought in mind for a while you have something to do with your salvation no i didn't have because you didn't sell me the prophet said then i didn't choose i didn't say it that way he gave you a choice amen but he knows your choice amen see i'm wanting you and i to realize that we do have something to do we have to accept our salvation and we can run all we want to on the the the choice was god's choice it wasn't mine well that's all right but remember he knew what you'd do you're going to have it on predetermining without given a choice i believe you have a choice you have a you have a right to accept jesus christ as your savior or reject him and god does according to what you desire on that that's right that's as simple as i can make predestination okay it says predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny go ahead go ahead number four door to the heart that's the reason when paul speaks of it in corinthians there are romans he said before either child was born esau and jacob both were good holy parents god said i hate esau and love jacob that's his election that his election might stand true how many ever read that now you you can't believe an election you know just exactly what would happen certainly he's not willing but his foreknowledge lets him know he don't just say i'm going to save this and lose that one he wants all you all saved but it's for knowledge no who would so therefore he could predestinate according to the for to foreknowledge and that's election see that's you calling an election sure looking back jesus came and the last ones to be saved will be saved the church will what is it predestinate it by foreknowledge yes but brother dale that don't give me the thrill when brother so-and-so explains predestination i can just see myself back there uh running around up in heaven and i do you're a mormons i like that so right go ahead right you know but you don't have no scriptures for those things see you run off the scale remember that's what our point was if you ain't careful you'll run off scale this way or run off scale that way we don't want to run off on neither one right all right go ahead number five i just want to read these and then that way you'll know exactly where i stand and then we'll get into christ is a mystery and it may be surprising the approach that's taken because it has to be it has to be the way the word the resurrection messy the resurrection of jesus as well stated predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks onto destiny that's simple amen god predestinates by his foreknowledge he doesn't predestinate by his desires see that's predetermining factor that won't work well now he chose me oh i just believe it i'm one of them seed but them old judases and things like that they don't have no no hope for them people well he concluded all under sin amen so if he made judas a sinner we're just as big a sinner as judas whether you like it or not no i'm not i'm i'm a i'm a predestinated seed brother dale where did you get it because if you're going to pre-determine it i'm going to state it again where you're listening if you're going to predetermine something be careful because if you're going to predetermine god in his doings then remember you ain't got a choice now remember there's no foreknowledge if you're going to predetermine it well i thought we was to be i thought we was this great seed that's the doctrine of the message that we come here with this seed in us where's it at that's all i asked a brother we was coming back from um fellowship a minister's meeting was having one time with his brother he he was laying on that i said well let's ask you one question where's the seed is it in your body your spirit of your soul where's the seed that's that's all i'm asking you i ain't talking to you i said yeah i know you ain't cause you don't have no answer for it you see where where's the seat at and remember your prophet said the seed was put there before the foundation of the world amen now what you have to do with any of it don't give you a choice you've got to be careful what's now well stated predestination looked back to foreign knowledge for knowledge looks to destiny all right and god in the beginning could see all things the way it would happen therefore he could tell this will be this way and that'll be that way and this will be this way and that way because he by for knowledge he wasn't willing that the left side in other words pointing out would be wrong that's this would be in other words left not in the right or not he didn't want that to happen but being god he knew it would happen that way so therefore he could foretell what would be and he knew the end from the beginning that wonderful and to think that every born-again child of god tonight has that privilege and assurance to know that god knoweth his own see that's right god knoweth his own that's that's what i don't understand well keep on reading go to number six [Music] this is from the message the power of god the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better predestination looks backs to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination now he's explaining what looking back and forth because that's the point of reading all of these things but god not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way in other words you think well i'm predestinated and i can't go no other way well let's answer the question to me when a man back there was told he was going to die he asked god and god gave him 15 years now you explain that when we'll talk well but that they don't need that because he order went ahead and died anyway because he he messed up i agree with you he messed up but that ain't the point the point is he asked for time and god changed his mind oh no god don't change his mind well what did he do he gave him 15 years he didn't change his mind no he died because he was told you're going to die there was no time limit in when he was going to die and he died but god gave him 15 years is this thing a stamp set thing you got exactly 82 years 421 days trying to get you away from a set period a point of looking at something that's well if it's meant for me to die then i'll die well there's a point to that that's true i meant to die you're gonna die that's true i don't need no revelation that's just plain sins but then how come it is that god will change his mind how come there was a little girl that brother random spoke of that she had this disease or something and she was sick and all in other words she died finally died and brother ron said he told her that she wasn't going to die told her something about it and she died he said god you owe me an answer he said he let me pout it out for about three months he said then he come and told me said she was supposed to die a year or so ago when she was in that river and drowned we said i gave her time to make a choice but see what's that now it's got to be to the second it ain't that away you can't go no other way well yep so i guess whatever will be will be no i don't have nothing to do with that okay now listen but god in order to be god amen he knowed the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen he knows it amen he knows it he knows what the end will be the second will be yes because he's god but he knew that before the world that's just for knowledge see his foreknowledge is greater and understanding than our predetermining okay number seven where i think pentecost failed but if we'd only go back to find out when god made his first man now he's going all the way back oh he's going all the way back see that's where we're gonna have to go across some history if we could go all the way back to that man we might find something when he made his first man he made man in his own image and god is a spirit so he had to make spirit man now the word is used there in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated is not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use why because it kind of confuses people when you say predestinate it confuses them that's why it's not a good word to you predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to full knowledge for knowledge goes to destiny in other words god didn't say now i'll make this man be this and i'll make this man be that but in order to be god he had to know the end from the beginning so in order to foreknowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because it was god and knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe in that don't you yeah go ahead to the next i'm just trying to get these cause i want you to understand it the message of faith of abraham and predestination is a hard word among a congregation of people because predestination really for knowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks owned to destiny that god be an infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore before esaur or jacob either one was born god could say esau i've hated jacob of love because he foreknew what they could be he never made he saw the way he was he wasn't willing that esau would be that way but esau by choice god knew would take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart and if you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool god because he knows your heart you'll never you can't do it go ahead to the next one communion church h all right let's see there's a couple here i want you yeah i want you to think on this one with me for a minute before i close this subject i know there is a question in your mind you will want to know if i believe in the doctrine of pre-existence i don't believe in that mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls now listen i shouldn't say things but i try to be clear to all things now i've approached ministers on this when i would quote brother branham and say i don't believe in the doctrine of pre-existence when he believed in some form of pre-existence well what do you believe i don't believe in a pre-existence because if you're going to pre-existence you're going to predestination okay all right i said well ago in order to clear in your head what we don't believe in pre-existence okay you say well now i don't believe in that mormon doctrine but he believed in a pre-existence of souls he just didn't say that he didn't believe it what did he say i don't believe in that mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of soul any more than i believe in reincarnation amen because reincarnation is what you was something here and you moved over to here you existed before and then you come to this you reincarnated so he didn't believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls have you ever looked that up transmigration means to go from one body to another look it up in webster transmigration means to go from one body to another one he didn't believe in going from one body to another in other words me and me and brother johnny can't swap bodies you can't go from one body to another because that would mess you up be careful and see it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed i believe in a predestinated eternal seed right i believe in it amen but the prophet told us when the seed was put there amen he said it was put there before the foundation of the world amen because that's his foreknowledge his foreknowledge was sitting back before the foundation world and saw the whole thing amen any problem what kind of a god do you believe in oh but i believe in this predestination all right what was before the world you as a person no it wasn't nothing you were only in his mind now mind is going back to foreknowledge yes in his mind in his foreknowledge he could see he knew if he made us we'd fall he knew that but that wasn't the downfall of the whole mankind but he knew that we'd fall now what kind of a goody goody are we to know that god made us knowing we'd fall well he didn't give me a choice that's the problem he gave you the choice he gave you the choice and the choice was you allowed yourself to fall you fell of your own free will not his he didn't want you to fall but he knew you would well he didn't give me a choice why didn't he give you a choice you're going to predetermine it before you ever start well don't worry about it that's right let's eat drink and be merry cause tomorrow we die well if i happen to be over on this side i'm okay but if i don't go on this side i've faced it ever since i've been in this message people are hollered about the the predestinated seeds and things and taking it back to making it that some people come into the world as an ability to be saved and others came with no ability to be saved i remember there a few weeks ago calvinism believes only a few people are to be saved armenianism leaves it for everybody but you've got to make your own choice so now where we're going well i don't i i'm glad i'm not one of the most serpent seed i've told you over and over i don't care if i could run my lineage all the way back and find out i was a direct dead descendant from cain that wouldn't bother me none whatsoever because that has nothing to do with my salvation has nothing to do with my soul amen if you don't give cain an opportunity to be saved you're making a full predetermining factor you're the one that's cutting him off don't cut him off god didn't cut him off right he told him right there in the word said if you'll do what your brother done you'll be all right that's why i wouldn't care i wouldn't care if you could run me all the way back and find out because see they can run these lineages back to find out who you come from well what are you worried about it well i want to know who i was you know i got enough trouble knowing who i am [Music] you might want to know who you was i got problems with who i am when i get through with this who i am i think i'll be out of here right okay come on that's the way way back too far back from the human mind of grass the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed jacob have i loved but he saw how i hated right but now remember one thing how could god hate esau he hated his ways he hated the person of what he was doing and what he was making his own choice he didn't there is no such word out of god to make a word hate you can't go to god and find the word hate where can you well he's got a right to hate no if he made you that way you can you can go right straight to him and he can't judge you if he made you wrong you can go before god and say you made me this away but he'll look back at you and say i didn't make you that way i gave you a choice and you took it now abide by your choice okay but now listen i'm gonna just bring a little thought we'll try to i just wanted to read those there's a whole bunch more but i just wanted to read the mind ones that's dealing with what he was saying where he says predestination doesn't come first for knowledge comes god predetermines by his foreknowledge so a destiny sure is set for every one of us everybody in the world is set with that right but you know what i love about the god that we serve you know he knows he he knows that person and just using the word of hot and talk back in some country there but you know what he's so good he doesn't stamp them as cut out they know nothing about him so they can just say in no way that they're saved but they can be given eternal life because of the fact of what they're good in their own tribes and doings in their own land what about a god of that way so let's don't play with him amen let's take it for what it is god knew you'd be sitting here today oh no i got up and just come here like one brother said that uh brother branham told him said well god had to drag you here he said well what do you mean he had to drink how did it what wasn't he he said well no difference where i come in the lifestyle where i come but see he didn't see what all went right was involved in that or how many wrecks was to kept from the man or what it is he was just seeing the fact that he he just went every day the same what do you think did god be for the world set a destiny for each and every one of us are that he by foreknowledge knew what the destiny of each one of us would be he knows what you're thinking what you're doing what our actions are what are reactions and why you're saying that if not then what kind of a god do you have you can't say god for you all things if you don't allow him to do it but listen get what i was saying there a moment ago for knowledge predestination is out here going that way for knowledge is back over here looking at what you're seeing okay for knowledge so then he could sit back before the world and know everything that we'd ever do or wouldn't do ever thought we'd ever have everything's going on amen so there's no need of trying to pull nothing over on him it's just a fact of saying god save my soul save me lord for myself mainly because that's my biggest enemy you're not my biggest enemy my biggest enemy is me i'm the one i have to deal with i see i deal with it like the same way i do here i look at it at the basis of what i'm saying god how did you do this he simply said i set back before the world and watched the world transpire i saw everything that would take place and i didn't have to make you do wrong had he made even adam wrong they could argue the point he didn't make them wrong he made them the way they are the the ability to fall was not a not a point of making them do but he knew what they'd do but you know what he also knew what you'd do he knew what you'd do yeah he knew whether you'd want to be saved or not he knows that now let's don't blame him for the choices yeah but but brother how could he choose me he never chose me wrong because you see that's not what you're dealing with here's what you're dealing with chosen us in him amen you say well how could we be chosen in him because the bible said that it was before the foundation of the world he stood as a lamb slain before the world ever begun if our name was ever written in heaven or any way it was written then won't be added down the road it was back there so which one do i want to go to destiny i want to know my destiny owner no i want to know my foreknowledge it may not sound good but you think about it the destiny that i've come to be one day out there i'll reach that destiny but you know what if i wasn't in his foreknowledge then my destiny won't do me no good right but my destiny i believe this message i'm i'm saved i know what i'm saying i know that i'm a christian i know i've been what are you arguing about well i'm looking forward but no i'm looking back that's an odd one i guess i'm looking back in his knowledge and he sees my choice like i said we want to make it and take our points but listen just one little point jacob have i loved he saw how i hated brother donnie brought it my attention because i know brother branham says that that uh jacob was a shyster you know the last quotes i gave on that last message he said esau was a shyster too so he calls both of them shysters you know that's that's all right jacob was a better man i mean was a a bad shyster he's always a better man you can't find anything that that esau was doing wrong except taking care of his daddy and doing all of the things looked like a good guy and god looks down and says jacob i love this all i hate like i've always said be careful how you place things the bible says david is a what he said a man after my own heart god is a murderer an adulteress uh oh be careful what you're saying when david was committing adultery and murder and all like out that didn't have anything to do with god jacob was the worst guy that could ever be because of all of the dirty tricks he pulled on everybody put it on esau then run from esau twice on and got everything he had got his birth right got everything and then he run and he was dealing with oh his future dad-in-law was there and he got the con artist doing with that sure he was scared to death he had a right to be scared when he was coming back he thought esau was going to kill him see we don't look at god in his way god came down into the heart of esau and esau looked out there and saw jacob coming he didn't grab his sword and start running for his throat he went to hug his brother's neck esau looks like a whole lot better guy in every form but yet what does the bible say jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated why did he hate him he hated his ways because his ways is what he was he gave away his birthright he gave away all of the things and look he saw then being that guy but god could still come down are you going to tell me esau is a serpent seed you may be careful the way you preach serpent seeds and things like i said the other day you're talking about uh hagar oh she ain't nothing ain't nothing god put her in the right place god told her to do this god told her to do that and made a nation out of it you don't listen you don't read your bible and think about it jacob wanted that birthright and he was willing to do everything he could to get it let me ask you a simple question and end it all how bad do you want the baptism of the holy ghost how bad do you want it well brother dale i want the baptism in the holy ghost so bad how bad do you want it because that's what jacob represented the baptism of the holy ghost might not be so much sad as we think to put you in a home push you through the other side you might find out one of these days and god kind of looks at things and it sways a little bit and don't misunderstand me but it's kind of sways a little bit in our life we're not all so goody-goody and walking so straight then we look down at the other one and say look at what they're doing better look at what you're doing we better keep ourselves involved don't worry about everybody else it's me and you lord it ain't me and all right come on just for one thought listen if it would be that you could choose which would you choose calvinism or armenianism i want to choose jesus christ because that way the bible said i was chosen in him amen not chosen off him chosen in him where was that at when he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world i was chosen right there i want to go back to there and then whatever thing he's got for anymore that's all right but don't take your destiny and shove it over here put your destiny on out and let it just be what it is it's out you're under waiting on us come on musicians it's waiting on us we have a destiny but everybody has a destiny but if i accept jesus christ as my savior he paid the price but you see he's looking here i'm looking there i'm looking back before the foundation of the world to where that he died in my place he paid the price where are we at foreknowledge is a wonderful word those who he foreknew what does that mean brother dale before the foundation of the world in his foreknowledge he foreknew exactly what we would do so let's stay with the foreknowledge and remember now when i come out with the next message and start talking about christ is a mystery of god revealed and god had a plan and purpose don't lose what i'm talking about stay with the point that he believes in foreknowledge and that god sets everything according to that foreknowledge well no he picked his people he picked this group of people he picks that group of people i can find your quotes but just remember go back to foreknowledge let's stand together that's right all we got brother [Music] [Music] all [Music] know [Music] abraham will teach his children [Music] jacob jesus wanted [Music] what about you jesus [Music] [Applause] oh jesus see god is [Music] see salvation is for everybody right but everybody's not going to receive it we know that but that won't be god's fault that'll be our fault we trigger our own predestination i guess the way brother tom used to say it [Music] see i believe you do have something to do with it see i believe that some people live a good clean life maybe not even a christian [Music] you know good people i do you have neighbors you have people around you or something that they live a good life and that's not gonna put them into heaven but how about coupling that with the fact of jesus christ coming to pay the price brother dale i you can't be good enough to get saved no let my salvation mold me into what he wants me to be right then he can set my destiny [Music] but you see you're going to find out that what it is we get back to it it's in this age that he predetermines a group of people to come to the stature of a perfect man [Music] if this age is the only age it was promised to totally come to there see they're going to come to that because they're going to come to the knowledge of his word and they're going to know right where he stands and where they stand and determine it because he predestinates a people because he knew he looked down through and seen what you and i would be doing in this day by doing that then he can predetermine [Music] but you were chosen for this age because of what you are well there's anything good about me no now don't get none of that junk involved there's nothing good in any of us but he did look down and see some desires god predestinates according to your desire [Music] you desire to be a christian he's got it ready if you desire to be a sinner he lets you go for knowledge father we just ask you to go with us now and be with us give us a little rest time and then come back together this afternoon listen in the way to minister your word and just pray that god would lead each and every one of us in thine understanding that we may walk in you forgive our sins and show us our ways lord we love you and keep us now in jesus name amen you just [Music] i'm going to praise him and forevermore i will reign with him [Applause] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music]
