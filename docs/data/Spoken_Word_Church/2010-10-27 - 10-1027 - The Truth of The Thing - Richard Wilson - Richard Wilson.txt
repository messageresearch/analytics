one is worthy of all praised bless each one bless the request of prayer heal our sick and save our lost let St in our tonight home in our little church our Lord bless him be each one we pray bless the service now we pray and ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let me read a couple of verses here in Revelations 3 Brother Joseph asked me minute ago what be the title of my message and I I told him to title it the truth of the thing that's why I believe we have have the truth that's what brother Bron called because so we'll call it message a thing but God is but Bible does and brother BR does right exactly so you know what you're saying when you say that right Revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come into him s with him and he with me and him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my Throne he as I also overcame and have sat down with my father and his throne he that have near let him hear what the spirit say into the churches may the Lord bless his word you be seated now it's always you know you've heard it many many times but it's always to the Overcomer right you he that overcome it exactly no one's going to sit with him he didn't say sit on his Stone he say set in his Stone right right so no one's going to sit there unless you're an overcome amen amen exactly so now that's a and right here here's the the time now the overcoming it this is what we overcome right mean way we get on the other side if we make it the other side we we overcome right so then so we want to be be sure that we we hear the word brother BR he mentioned it before and you know and sure brother Dale has and the scripture even mentioned that that people tremble at the word right with reverence you know not just you're afraid of God or not you tremble at God says something you know you know that's he can't change it he can't take it back so it's going to happen the way am and you see yourself so far away from that you know right so you said only only God can do it only God can take you there you know and we sing that song There's a land beyond the river that we call us free forever you know there is a land beyond the river I don't want to die to go there I believe a land here there's a land beyond the river here GL spiritually speaking we go to we go to right here right that's right exactly right so remember that scripture I read on Revelations 3 that him that overcometh will sit with me in my Throne amen now I believe that takes place right here amen we know we s judg and we even judge Angels Saints with things that nature but I believe we overcome and we sit with him in his throne right here right because his throne is not the Father Strong right right all right now I got a lot of things wrote down in books here and uh and you know me I promise to speak an hour and you know and it's hard to quit an hour but but I I'll make it I promise I won't go much over now if I go that long so you just pray that the Lord will help us amen because when you got something to say you believe the Lord has give you something right and you want to you want to said you want the people to give that's right we come tonight you know to hear from him not hear me amen right see if John sent me down here he came in me going to be me say it brother Terence will be one who praying minut to go someone it's not going to be me saying it it's going to be him saying it through me am now if it's of gone if it's ordained of gone and if you have a need tonight and you're sick and you need healing nice to get healed he Jehovah brother Dale been preaching on was seven compound redtive names that's marvelous is it think that that one of them he took the 23rd psalms well I thought I have a spell on that one that's that's something else that's right so so he's all it all consummates all those names titles and his wonderful counsel Mighty God everling father Prince of all consummates in the person that's in you if you're if you're born again amen that's right it's all right in him right and Jesus all applies to Jesus Christ right so you can't have one that have them all like brother said they're incept you can't separate you can't have the father without having the son right you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost that's right only one person many titles always know there's one PR one God he's one in person that's right always remember that that's right and that one God lives in here right that's right he's right here right it's where he well he it's he at Psalms 100 it's he that has made us that's right right you're son and daughter of God T not God made you that he made you that before the world Glory exactly right so you just manifesting the hour the time that you come down and God saw you on Earth he knew the age you'd be here you the time your mom and dad have and ground you come through the all those things God knew it that's right can you B your eye out God knew it that's right I love that right okay now let's turn John 14 if you want to read with me and maybe he said I he overcome sits with me in my Throne he do I overcame sit down my father in his throne what what Throne came back on day Pentecost Father Strong baptism the Holy Ghost that's where he went all right you know those things there some common if you ain't careful there'll let be something too common to it already really set our soul on fire right really that's right by way we got be like a house burning down on a windy day I told the church our Sunday I said listen give me some Wildfire I don't have some Wildfire no fire all said I don't know you know not a bunch of foolish you know what I'm saying this is something to be happy about that's right people say well we need to be revived speak for yourself I'm rived I'm been resurrected you brother de exctly I've been born from the dead I'm the first born from the dead right exactly right unel I believe what he said I mean I understand everything but I believe it amen and I'll come to understanding to come now verse 16 John 14 I'll pray the father he'll get to give you another comforter and he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth see that's the spirit that you overcome with he hear Let Him hear the spirit right the spirit there's only one Spirit that's the Holy Spirit right right Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not heither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen see now the world don't know it yep that's right you can't tell the it's ain't to the world this message is only to the elect it's only two the people that only one that's the elect of God the predestinated that's the only ones that's considered in Redemption that's right am right see God knowing that what what we we would do it what we choose what we would choose God knows your choice before the foundation of the world right right it's not that you come down here around God's going to make you do no he saw what you do right amen now listen I told the church the other day this is the truth you don't have to tell a True Believer to pray come on not a True Believer you don't have to tell Daniel Daniel need to pray right you have tap Daniel to pray right exactly he said he knew the one true and living God who he was he wanted to talk to them right you tell somebody you need to go to church right you need to do this you need you don't have to tell them right the doors is open it's a burning in their heart to get in here the True Believer now brother say it's not that way you need to pray right right that's right exactly Hallelujah right I've always been that way hav you all right that's what David said I will not leave you c as I'll come to you yeah a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also amen right that's eternal life at that day ye shall know that I am in my father see I went to my father's strong right and ye and me and I in you right right at that day now brother Bram said in Christ the my got land he says that's this day the day of the this Revelation when the day when you see the truth of the thing you're going to know that amen you can believe there more than two or three Gods right two or three persons in the godhead you a going to do that right no no no you see the truth of it that's right right the truth is there's one true and living God right right and that God is in you right right by birth he's birth there right okay now let's go to uh I got another scripture I want to read brother Dale has been reading he's read this some in in the Matthew 17 when Jesus went on Mount Transfiguration you know Peter
