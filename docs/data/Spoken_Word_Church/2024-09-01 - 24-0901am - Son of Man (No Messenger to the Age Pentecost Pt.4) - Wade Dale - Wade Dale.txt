our youth service it'll be the last youth service we do before um end of the year then we'll start again next year and brother Daryl Ward to be here in January we' already got that got that scheduled you know we're talking about the U no Messenger to the AG and I've been uh looking at some isza Street um people that have come out I know all of you know Smith Wigglesworth all right great powerful man of Faith he actually came from England over here to the isua street Rev to see what was going on so the isua Street Revival we've been talking about 1906 started the Holy Ghost fell on a group of people and that started the Pentecostal Revival that we should still be under now amen but I want to read to you what Smith Wiggles worth I read to you the other day what he said but listen to what his methods were now remember he's he's a great man of Faith uh he even told a man that had one leg he said go buy you par shoes it's in his book he said go buy a pair of shoes well he limps into the shoe store with one leg sits down tells the guy what size shoe he wants by the time the man got back that man's got two feet so that's God that's the power of the Holy Ghost even in Smith Wigglesworth wasn't even a prophet okay slow down a little bit listen to his methods often involved hitting slapping punch ing The Afflicted part of the body amen yall come up here for prayer for your head on a number of occasions his approach to persons suffering from stomach complaints was to punch them in the stomach sometimes with such force it propelled them across the room anybody got stomach trouble today okay see they're healed already when challenged on this his response was I don't hit them I hit the devil responding to criticism over his method woodsworth said you might think by the way I went about praying for the sick that I was that I'm unloving and rough but oh friends you have no idea what I see behind the sickness and the one who is Afflicted I am not dealing with the person I'm dealing with the satanic forces that are binding The Afflicted the only difference in Smith Wigglesworth being under Reformation my point is brother randam could stand and tell you where the disease was he didn't have to hit you in the stomach he knew where the dis disease was called it out discerned it knew it by another dimension where Smith Wigglesworth was just working if my stomach hurts I'm going to punch the devil out of it on one occasion Wigglesworth declared to the sick I'll only pray for you once to pray twice is unbelief the second night a man approached the altar to receive the prayer again and Wigglesworth recognized him and said boy it embarrass a lot of us didn't I pray for you last night you are full of unbelief get off my platform oh and we think we're rough but he had results I mean he got results be timid the devil will be all over us so let's bow our heads just for a moment dear heavenly father thank you for the day you've give us thank you for the time that you've set aside Lord for us to have service Lord you said we're two or three gathered together you'll be in their midst so Lord I believe there's more than two or three today that want to hear from you father so Lord as they pull on the gift Lord may they may they pull on you not not this human man that has many many faults and failures Lord but pull on the gift that's inside Lord I pray that You' touch each one Lord pray for the ones that are sick that are not here Mom different ones Lord sister um Johnny and Sister Mary and all the ones that we pray for on a daily basis father I pray that you'd touch their hearts father and touch their bodies Lord I pray that you'd be with us in further in this service be brother Lise sometimes we don't pray brother Lis is back there Lord doing the best he can to to get the message to the to our uh Hispanic group Lord I pray that you'd bless him bless them Lord for their efforts for coming and we appreciate them Father we appreciate all you've give us Lord and we thank you Father be with us in the furth of this service in Jesus name amen yeah we went and at brother um brother Donald's house last night and brother Donald raise your hand everybody know who you are okay we went and dedicated his house yesterday so I told him I said so much Mexican food I'll be burping all day tomorrow so but it was good though oh it was good that was a good Feast so now we're on no we're still looking at no messenger the age I want to bring out something this afternoon and brother Ryan hit on it today that that sparked something else that we need to look at brother rhom said that the the Pentecostal Revival in 1906 was a restoration of the gifts now the greatest gift is is what brother Ryan read it's the love of God given to G given us Jesus Christ so that we can love him and he already loved us before the foundation of the world remember he Canan love you don't ever say God don't love me no more no he can't love you no less either if he ever loved you to the beginning he loves you now all right that's the devil talking to you but we have been promised the restoration of the gifts and I want to say to this church he promised us the restoration of the gifts because I'll read to you this afternoon where brother R said the gifts were given to the church to keep them clean to keep all the garbage out keep all the unbelief out keep all the things is you bring those non spiritual gifts in it don't have to always be speaking in tongues that's the lowest of the gifts the greatest gift is wisdom prayer Faith all those different things that we have in the church working that we do have the gifts working in the church but if we don't have speaking in tongues and interpretation everybody says well you don't have the gifts no no no there's nine of them and they're shown in different ways and we'll look at it this afternoon if you'll if you'll bear with me today we'll get to that so Joel 2:23 said be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord now remember this is the scripture that Peter read on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell back there this is what he read all right be glad then ye children of John Z and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now we'll get into the former and latter rain but remember what former rain what does a rain do a rain brings something up all right now the first rain which is the former rain is the teaching rain it's the planting of the seed you got to plant something for it to grow you can rain a flood I planted some food plot stuff yesterday and man it got some rain last night praise God for the rain amen and it'll come up because it's going to have rain on the seed that's been planted and then the lad rain or the Harvest rain should happen sometime in uh around November so that you everything will boom up to maturity and then you can Harvest it so that's the former rain brother Ram said the former rain is the teaching rain the latter rain is the Harvest rain so we need the former rain teaching because the latter rain is catching us out of here that's where you bind all the tears together that's where you bind all the wheat together wheat goes into Rapture tear stays here all right everybody with me on that so that's what the former and we'll get to that cuz brother Brenham he preached both but we are to manifest both cuz he had took a Rapture not yet right or the Harvest rain the Harvest rain has to come from somebody standing here somebody standing in this Dimension all right I'm got you standing too long I'm sorry and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years the Locust Eed the cankerworm caterpillar pommer worm my great Army which I sent among you which was what to eat the to eat the word down during the ages we'll talk about that a little bit this afternoon and ye shall eat in plenty who is Ye Ye my people God's people he's talking about Israel but we are the people of God all right and praise the name name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed Are you ashamed to be a Christian today no I am not I am not ashamed to be a Christian and if you stand for him now he'll stand for you then it shall come to pass afterward look after that that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh everybody with me on that now listen listen the way it's written is the way it means anybody can receive the Holy Ghost now they couldn't in the Old Testament that's right they couldn't when Jesus was here amen it was barred it was under bulls and goats it was a substitute but when the fullness of time come when Jesus died and come back he said I'm coming back to get inside of you and I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaid so it doesn't matter who you are if you want the Holy Ghost today he's getting ready to pour it in you all right and upon the handmaid in those days will I pour out my spirit you may be seated Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word I thought that was pretty powerful about Smith Wigglesworth and also even brother Brown talks about FF Bosworth FF Bosworth was there on the zuda street thank you then you another one one of must not be working one's not working it's okay okay all right all right Acts 2 verse1 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come now we know what Pentecost is it's 50 the Holy Ghost fell on 50 days after the death of Jesus okay after the Passover and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house that they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like fire all right we'll get into that maybe this afternoon and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so the gifts were not just restored in the first church age in the first Pentecostal age they were developed cuz you hardly anybody speak in tongues that said maybe prophets or maybe somebody uh uh Caiaphas he prophesied but this is an overall this is an outpouring on ad30 was on 120 and on 3,000 now in 1906 it went from a few to Millions I think they calculated 600 million people came out of that 1906 so he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh that was God's promise he's going to give it to everybody amen that wants it that's right it wasn't just for a select few but there was just a select few back then because remember you and I are under the age of um uh rapid intelligence and also rapid information if you want information today punch a button all you got to do Google it ask Siri right they didn't have that they had to physically take the word they didn't even have a Bible they had to take the word in their heart that's why I understand from reading back in the history and when we were coming through there with Constantine and the different ones that's why it got all scrupled up man could say this over here and he started Doctrine and there'd be no way to know it until it came around to somebody else so there's where you got your divisions from there was nothing to fight it with well today we have something to fight it with today false Doctrine needs to be taken care of amen and we have a we have something to take care of it with amen the word of God all of it and then the Amplified version of 1160 sermons that brother Brandon preached all right I just believe that he's a Divine revealer of the word of God that's what brother brandom is not was he's still alive if y'all don't mind me saying that he's not in this Dimension but he's more alive now than he was then right so we started with a pentec Al Revival over there on right at the beginning right before Paul comes on the scene there was a Pentecostal Revival Paul was not in it we'll read it in a minute we read it Wednesday night Paul's not in it or whatever the last night pre what time I preached Pentecostal Revival over there in the beginning Paul was not a part of that Paul was a church age Messenger to Ephesus all right but there had to be a Pentecostal age because remember God's in a lap over so they lap from the Old Testament to the New Testament right that's why you had to have John the Baptist to be there to transition the hearts of the fathers to the Pentecostal babies or the ones on uh 1906 not 1906 but 8030 but then you look over here if we're if that's the alphab bride and it began out of a Pentecost all right then we're the Omega bride we're the Omega bride here Alphas over there they started with the Pentecost then we had to have a Pentecost right here right and think of it brother bradam couldn't have come out of a Methodist Revival he had to wait till the restoration of the gift so that people would know that there was gifts to get now listen John Wesley I'm sorry I'm going I'm speaking slow they're telling me to slow down okay thank you Regina I couldn't see Christina in the back so Regina's doing it now just slow down yeah slow down I don't want I don't I don't want brother Louise to um to uh miss anything I I'm sorry so just bear with me not that I'm trying to think I'm trying to stop for a second okay so on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell now we'll look at it in a minute the Holy Ghost fell on that day of Pentecost on two different groups of people all right two different groups of people we get to that in a minute now what happened though in 1906 it fell on one group of people is everybody with me but they were babies they didn't know how to use the gifts amen they didn't know how to use them brother Brown told them Pentecostal babies all right so we'll get to that but remember they matured they matured because how did the how did the ones at 3,000 in ad30 how'd they mature God sent a prophet Paul all right then in the end time you had Pentecost it was true the baptism of the Holy Ghost was their leader all right param was the spokesman and and Seymour was the spokesman but the Holy Ghost fell himself to bring the gifts back right then God sent a prophet to straighten everything else out just like he did over here cuz remember in Peter's age and all those different ones you still had people back in in in u the Old Testament come on until ad70 they were still having sacrifices in Jerusalem in the temple because the temple was still there right but in 8070 Titus destroyed it took the temple away and that's why they're building it back now the Jews have to have a temple to worship God sir but God has a temple now to Worship in to worship with and in and through that by way with me on that all right that's why he said I'll pour out my spirit not on all buildings he said I'll pour out all flesh that's why you're going to have we we won't get to it today but next week or the week after you got anointed ones they're Anointed with that same true holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost it just falls on their Spirit realm don't go down into their soul it just anoints them yes sir which can come off and come on and come off and come on but remember on the day of Pentecost that Pillar of Fire didn't come off those people it went in those people and when you receive the Holy Ghost now it doesn't just come on you it goes inside of you and it burns there's fire there that burns all that out we'll get to that in just a little bit so what does God promise that we have a covenant that used to be back over there the the fathers in the Old Testament they were the old Prophets The Isaiah and all the different ones what did they do though they prophesied of a Time coming all right now also remember brother brandham was a prophet too he prophesied of a Time coming he was working in the astronaut age but he didn't see all the astronauts right this is the astronauts right here most of you weren't even born when he died in 1965 right right so you are though you were that thought he was prophesying of if he saw a vision of the Bride he saw you if your bride all right everybody with me that's why we're current modern day Believers were not like theusa Street they had flaws I said they the Holy Ghost don't have flaws but they had flaws and they continued to have flaws all the way through even in early Pentecost when brother bam come on the scene in the' 40s they would stand up and start speaking in tongues they start shouting right in the middle of a service you've seen you've read it and brother R didn't say anything until after a while why they were Pentecostal babies right but he knew that it was a real Holy Ghost fell on them remember those two guys that he went to visit one of them got up and spoke in tongues and the other got up and and prophesied and it was right but he said I discern that one man was true and that other man was living with another woman right that's I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh you can get caught up in emotion and forget about the word of God but you can't have the word of God without having some kind of emotion cuz it stimulates you cuz remember if it fell on them and they shouted in spoking tongues in 1906 they caught it and started speaking in tongues I'm not saying speaking in tongues you know that we've been taught different but we'll talk about this afternoon if it's a gift from God it's something you need to use cuz that's a gift from God if I give you a gift I give brother Donnie um I'm GNA give brother Donnie a an oil lamp or something that he a don't even have any I mean he'll just set up here and draw um dust I wasn't going to say that Sue sitting there but set up here and draw dust why cuz it's not for it's a gift I give him but it's not pertinent to what he was now if I give him a gun like he's given me a few they're put up in the safe and they're safekeeping that was a gift now if God gives you a gift it's perfect The Giver is perfect the gift is perfect it's how you use it amen you can use it right or you can just quench the spirit and never use it at all but we all will give an account for that for there was a tabernacle made the first R was the Candlestick the table the shoe bread remember that's sanctification and after the second Veil when you go into the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holy of holies so now what is the outside with the Candlestick the table to shoe bread that is your spirit realm everybody with me remember we were a three room and we have a body spirit and a soul your body outter Court your spirit spirit in courtt but the soul is the holy of holies that's where God is or is not amen they're not both in there at the same time right either you're born again today or you're not there's no in between now there's a journey there's a journey to that just keep going keep believing keep having faith be a believer believe in what God's already said he said he'd give you the Holy Ghost which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid with gold there was Mana there that God created and Aaron's Rod that budded which God created The Buds and the almonds and then God wrote the two tables that went into the are so that's a God thing when you go into there second realm man when you get all these emotions memory reason conscious effect and Imagination and all that goes to rolling around in our head God is not in that hello yes unless it's pertinent to what's in the deep inside of you when that deep inside of you comes out it's if it's God it's got to be God if it's the devil it's got to be the devil it can't be two it can't be both how can you take the Bible says a good thing out of an evil thing how can you get good water out of a bad well can't do it am so now listen to get started here the 83d 30 I'm going to refer to them as ad30 holy ghost that was the 120 in the upper room that Jesus had been with for 3 and a half years they were with him on almost every service they were with him he told them things but it started in Isaiah 53 as a promise he shall see the travail of that's he's talking about he God the travail of Jesus's Soul which is the same person shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many those who is Justified he's what he's already glorified all right so he had to start with justification for he shall bear their iniquities what we were talking about in justification you can't justify yourself there's no way you can justify yourself but I that's justifying yourself no I like what Louise says but God but God said see Let God justifies if he's the justifier if he's just and the justifier and he's the judge and he's the jury we got no problem I wish it was that simple but we do have problems cuz we get in the way but I so now Romans 3:30 Paul tells the sin is one God which shall what which shall justify the circumcision by faith all right he's talking about the Jews and the uncircumcision which is the Gentiles through faith so so you got to go through something he knew the Gentiles would have to go through something he had to what put away the he he put away the um Israel to get the Gentile Church the uncircumcised do we then make void the law through faith God forbid you can't do away with the law God forbid yay we establish the law and as somebody said here not too long ago if you got the Holy Ghost you only one that can live the law you can live that law to the letter amen cuz why would he write it if we couldn't live it he knew they couldn't live it but he had to give them something to guide them through so that there could be a judge or a judgment in the Old Testament until the righteous judge came and died for us and Justified all of us if you'll accept it okay kind of simple Faith but that's the way it starts then Jesus in John 17 he's talking to the father he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true so how are we going to be Sanctified as brother Ryan says if we don't read our Bible That's What sanctifies us the washing of the water of the word all right that our five-fold ministry that tells you what the Bible says right all right don't change it tell you what it says and when you do and you conform to that then that sanctify remember sanctification is a process how do you eat an elephant one body at a time as thou has sent me into the world now watch see he's going to equip us because he's going to send us into the world he's not going to put us out here and make us powerless no as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world so he had to give them something to to work with listen he was the justifier he was the sanctifier and he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him when he was walking on Earth as human as a human being Jesus Christ the son of man you say I can't do it he promised you he'd help you do it if you let him do it am even for their sake I sanctify myself he set himself upon heart just for me and you he could have had a wife brother Brown said hello he could have had all these things but he he he sacrificed all that to show you a Sanctified life a Nazarite vow that he took that we as a Christians should take that same Nazarite vow just as he did right Amen to stay clean but sometimes we don't stay clean we let the human part get involved that's why we're going to talk to see this afternoon that's why God give gifts to the church one thing and one thing only is to keep the church clean that's it now there's exhortation and there's all these but most of the gifts are given to keep the church clean amen and then brother Brown said that's why Jesus is not here I'll read it this afternoon is because he hasn't come back because church is not ready but oh my we get upset trying to get ready but we going to get ready God going to have a church without spot a wrinkle I promise you that I'm not going to promise you that I say that's thus sayth the Lord because it's come out of the Bible without spot or wrinkle for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth that's why brother brandham had to restore everything back to the truth first then the gifts come right and the gift that that he had was perfect yes because it was the Holy Ghost himself the person of Jesus Christ standing inside of brother brandham telling those people what their problem was never failed one time neither pray I for these alone watch this but for them also which Shall Believe on me through the words of the people that I sanctify for them all also which Shall Believe that's us that's right on me through their word Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelist and you reading the word of God and you listening to tapes and you reading books John 20: 211 then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you now remember up here we we talk about Jesus has Justified he Sanctified them through thy truth so we went through justification and sanctification that's what the the apost Les in ad30 they they're under that Ministry we come down to the to the end of his ministry though and he's getting ready to leave he's getting ready to walk off the earth and go into another dimension Jesus say watch as my father has sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember they did not receive it then right cuz it was all wound up in Jesus hello I'll read you I got a quote for it okay okay that's what brother R said when I believe it too because he had to go away he was he was in that body I thinking the other day U Brother Gary he was in a Jesus was trapped God was trapped in a body cast called flesh that's what he was trapped in he couldn't get out unless he died so that body cast that was holding all that together had to die to release the life well right here he's getting ready to release it cuz he's coming back on the day of Pentecost right and give them the holy ghost that was inside of him then he could be in multiple places at one time amen me you and everybody else right and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sends you remit look how powerful this message is whosoever sins you remit amen they're remitted and whosoever sends you retain they are retained I like this in the Greek Lexicon that word breathe or breathed on them it's only used two times in the Bible for that definition to blow or breathe upon where Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew prophets expressed by the symbolic Act of breathing upon the apostles now see the symbolic act they even know it was a symbolic act okay the apostles the communication of the power of the Holy Spirit to them this word used only once by the whatever that is 20s something translate translators in Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam right and he became a living Soul amen just as the original creation was completed by an act of God so to the new creation was completed by an act from the head of the new creation and if y'all been around here long enough brother Dale preached many many sermons on born by the Breath of God that's what we are born when you're born again you're born by the Breath of God not the breath of the devil the death breath of your mama and daddy born by the breath of almighty God so they were what Adam was too he started the generation and now he's going to end the Generation by putting that same breath inside of a group of people amen and then what do we do we breathe it back out we can say to people brother Dale can say many many times receive ye the Holy Ghost brother dick brother alen all the different ones that came in under his ministry they heard the word of God brother collie brother Dy different ones they heard the word of God they were born by the Breath of God not the breath of Samuel Dale but by the Breath of God Amen that's right but it had to come through the body it had to come through the body you can't just hear the wind blow that's right amen right you got to hear it from somebody and that's the way God set it up because the gift he gave us the greatest five gifts he gave us was Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists that's the greatest gift he ever give us CU that's the only one now either all those gifts the N spiritual gift tells you that it'll help you and it'll do all these things for you right right but the Bible says in Ephesians that he gave you those five spiritual gifts to perfect you they didn't get perfected by the gifts back in in Pentecost you get perfected by the word of God through a five-fold Ministry it's the only way you're going to get perfected dear brother Brandon what's the difference when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they had to go to the upper room to tarry it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise but they had to go to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing is when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled that's right if we have time this afternoon there's there there's Divine Healing and there's miracle healing right Divine Healing is a process right instant healing is something fall off or you instantly your back foit hurting or or whatever but sometimes healing takes time that's what the Bible says and that's what brother Brown said Remember the Two Sisters remember they didn't get anything on the prayer line but a week later or after the meeting right they lived in the same community and one just jumped up and whatever it was they were healed and she run to the other one and the other one was screaming running around the kitchen you know what brother Brown said right he said the healing Angel went through their community that day what a mighty God we serve the healing act they didn't they weren praying in the closet and doing all their no they were going about their Duty right he he said the healing Angel remembered that promise and just went right through and healed them both of them in the same Community what a mighty God we serve so now the upper room Jesus tells them in Luke 24 before he leaves he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued or what or be sunk into with power from on high so when that day of Pentecost come that became a reality it came a sound of Heaven from Heaven A rushing Mighty Wind filled all the house and there appeared clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each one and you remember what happened but now remember that was one group of people people that was 120 that had been tutored by all that I just read you they heard that for three and A2 years every day day in and day out they put their faith that Jesus Justified them Sanctified them and when they come to the day of Pentecost boom Jo uh Peter stands up and says what this is that that I read you and Joel I read you the same thing Peter read you 2,000 years ago right and what did it do it pricked 3,000 people's heart amen 3,000 people heard that sermon and the word from the Old Testament was quickened to a group of people standing in the brand new testament cuz remember the Testament is not enforced till the testator's dead so God had Jesus had to die God can't died Jesus died amen so there had to be a new testament that's why we're at today we're going to take communion he's going to say this is what the New Testament in my blood this is something new but it's a testament that I'm going to come back and I'm going to dwell with you and you take this in remembrance of me so if you don't take it then you must have a remembrance of something else I'm sorry you must have a remembrance of something else because to take communion is to remember what Christ did for us and if he hasn't done that for you you got time repent come to the Lord take communion but now remember there was other people dwelling in Jerusalem devout men of every nation remember it was the day of Pentecost pente cost is a big feast and everybody from all nations came in thank God the Holy Ghost fell because it fell on 120 and then they preached to 3,000 and then they went out into their countries and took took the Holy Ghost with them instead of having to send the Holy Ghost to these and that and the other all the ones that we read here they're just uh you know several nations were there and God then through Peter freshly anointed by the Holy Ghost freshly received by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost Peter all those words were quickened to Peter that Jesus said come on brother Brown said the Holy Ghost fell on Sons in that Upper Room they become mature really really quick how could Peter tell us to do this right here if he had already made it hello you can't teach somebody something you don't know anything about and they were all amazed it was noised abroad and this thing just went out a minute some were confounded cuz they heard their they heard their native tongue spoken by somebody that wasn't part of their community are part of their Nation they be like me speaking today and brother Lis didn't have to interpret they're hearing me in Spanish you're hearing me in English because you're part of my you know my culture my my ethnicity but they were heing there see so it's not the speaking it's the hearing Faith doesn't come by speaking faith comes by hearing amen that created such a faith in those people so they said there was a group over here that didn't believe it though they said oh they're just drunk well yeah they were they were drunk on the Holy Ghost amen that ain't bad to be that way amen but then there's a group over here that says man that does something to my heart the Bible said it pricked their heart right in other words you feel a little how many of us have felt that though in a meeting though where the Holy Ghost was inside of you already but yet you heard false Doctrine all many times I'm sorry to say but many times you hear somebody say something and you go there's some there some little something that that pinches at your heart it says something's not right about that and even in situations in your life if you've not been through situations in your life where something says don't go down that road don't don't do that go this way or or don't say this say that amen see there's people children that are led by the spirit of God they're the Sons and Daughters of God you say have nothing you're a Powerhouse you all are a Powerhouse if you got the Holy Ghost you got more power in you than you ever will know you can create a world and go live on it hallu but I want to live by myself I'll tell you one thing if you're on an island by yourself you you put yourself there so anyway how and how hear we every man that was the whole question it wasn't the tongue speaking it was the hearing how is this miracle happening Hallelujah that I'm hearing I'm watching his mouth move in English but I'm hearing him in Spanish but Peter now watch standing up with the 11 remember Peter was the spokesperson all right he spoke on the day of Pentecost but remember he wasn't a Prophet come on he wasn't a prophet cuz he even said in his own writings he said Paul says things hard to be understood so Paul was like here being a church age messenger Having the Holy Ghost being a prophet he was the Divine reveal of the word Peter was not but Peter knew his position amen Peter didn't say bless God Paul I don't agree with nothing you said no when Peter and Paul met each other they had the same Doctrine but Peter standing up with the 11 I hope that happens two weeks from yesterday well we going to have about 30 preachers in this building praise the Lord but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be it known unto you and hearken to my words these are not drunken men as you suppose see it's just the third hour of the day which was 9:00 in the morning I believe it was but but this is that which was spoken by Joel he took it right straight to scripture and whether they understood that scripture or not they knew there was something going on and it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters your prophesy I read this just a little while ago and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and when he got finished preaching that sermon they said men and Bre what can we do to receive what you just got man when somebody receiv receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost that ought to just I mean it ought to just you just become one again you become one right it ought to be that right so you wonder whether it's it's the holy ghost or not I mean there are ghost this one's holy hello somebody the devil's a spirit too you know he a spiritual being so now look there was no Messenger to the first outpouring of the Holy Ghost so there's not going to be a messenger to the second outpouring of the Holy Ghost param and William Seymour were the spokesperson they stood up and said this is that this is what we've been waiting for this is it the Holy Ghost fell on those two people and then it started a Revival but remember just as the Revival started in ad30 there was still still a bunch of people that were in the Old Testament because remember the big the the thing that Peter and and Paul had a problem with it wasn't Doctrine but Peter was taking the circumcised were of God we've been circumcised all you over there you ain't been circumcised you go sit over there now Paul rebuked him and said there it's not circumcision or uncircumcision anymore it's uncircumcision of the heart amen you quit shunning them people quit shunning them Gentiles that's my people too because he was a prophet he was a what he want a reformer so now we got the spokesman now which is seeyour we have seen more in in param so the same patterns in this age no messenger but brother Ram come as a prophet on the scene as a Divine revealer not of the gifts he didn't reveal the gifts the gifts were already revealed he revealed how to use them and tie up all the Loose Ends listen we got a message that's perfect man's the one that's messed it up but this message is perfect cuz it didn't come from God it was God it was God speaking the voice of God for the end time was the voice of God sorry sorry Louise you supposed to say a SL down okay I just enjoy doing this I'm sorry I do so brother R said look justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work now remember justification in Martin Luther's day was the Holy Ghost for that day right God was pleased but God moved on so justification now won't get you in the body of Christ it'll get you cleaned up yes when you put your hand down I'll talk she's sanctification is a work of the holy spirit all right but the baptism is the holy spirit that's why you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit go to church read your Bible pray listen to tapes but somewhere you're going to tell what you are on the inside amen sometime it's going to pop right up and you can't help it cuz this is the age of Revelation everything will be made known if the seals are open the Bible's open our lives are open that's why the gifts come into the church to keep it clean keep that garbage out prise the Lord that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet who brother brandham to come down no Messenger to the age of Pentecost cuz the Holy Ghost came himself self in the fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age remember the messenger comes at the end of the age all right so here comes param and Seymour at the end of the Methodist age brings in a Pentecostal Revival they revive until about 1915 16 17 18 remember brother Bram doesn't come on the scene till 47 but remember he's preaching in 33 amen cuz he's Baptist remember he starts as a Baptist then he evolves we'll read it this afternoon it evolves through that into the Pentecostal that's the only ones that would accept him because he had a gift had a gift they couldn't deny the gift they didn't like the word that he preached but they couldn't deny that gift when he would stand there and say the doctor's got on a blue coat and you're in a green room and he's got a stethoscope in in his hand and you've got a Blue Dress On I mean he's so specific right they couldn't deny that but they denied the word they took the gift over the giver right that's the Pentecostal problem they took the gifts and said this is it well it doesn't matter if I got you know like brother B said you got a temp her to fight a buz saw or you commit adultery but you can speak in tongues you got it no you don't got it thank God for what a Divine revealer a prophet to come on the scene and put that thing right in order right but at the end of the age it was always ends up the others we find the messenger was sent all these Scruples what all the faults all the Scruples God don't have Scruples we have Scruples and things are to be placed in their place see like that then the Rapture comes for the church now remember Paul wasn't at Pentecost but he said he should have been brother BR was at Pentecost but he said should have been everybody with me on that so now look he didn't deny Pentecost he said it was a place that had to be it was a restored Pentecost back to the same thing the same signs the same message amen there you are all right real quick now we talk about the ones downstairs now remember the one downstairs when I say downstairs they were in a thank you somebody's upper they were in an upper room so there was no elevators back then no escalators back then so they were stairs and they had to come down so they came down to the 3,000 and preached to them so the Holy Ghost had already fell on 120 they were having a Pentecostal Revival these people down here didn't even know where they be there was even a group of people after that that was in the Bible that says we don't even know there be ho Holy Ghost right house of Cornelius or something said we don't even know anything about this Holy Ghost but we sure feel good what did happened Paul or Peter one had to come there with the Holy Ghost Inside of them to breathe on them how important to have the Holy Ghost in your soul the person of God all right real quick so in in ad what I mean back then the Holy Ghost fell on 120 mature they were word tutors is everybody with me cuz this is going to be important when we get to Malachi then there was 3,000 babies heard one powerful sermon they were pricked in their heart and said Mitten and Brethren what must we do to have what you got now what's the first thing Peter said go find you a message church and start listening to tapes and reading books no he said repent repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see he was a spokesman he was telling he wasn't telling them something that they did that that that was that was so new that they thought well now the Jesus said father son Holy Ghost Peter was telling them exactly what he said and they accepted it hello they accepted it and they were baptized they baptized 3,000 people in one day it took a lot of them 120 to help to baptize 3,000 people that's that's twice as many people lives in this city because there's only 1,500 lives in Lula all right so now isua Street what did the Holy Ghost fall on it fell on children that didn't know anything about this putting it together and they didn't know nothing about a prophet's message they didn't know anything about a seventh angel message that was here that was coming right they didn't know anything about that they just knew this is that they got the Holy Ghost they started speaking in tongues they started prophesying and and as brother Joe we were talking about that before the church he went to a um funeral the other day and there was most of them were women preachers well most of this Pentecost Zea Street were sisters a lot of them well don't get quiet on me I can tell you by history but remember when a prophet comes he's a Divine revealer of the word that's why he kept telling them women Don't Preach they should have read the Bible number one but they got so caught up in the gift see you can get so caught up in the gifts till you forget the give her you forget he said you can't have gifts over the word of God but brother randam put them both together gave us the word and the gifts and put them in order so ausa street now we're at 1906 it fell on children I'll I'll read you quote brother R said babbling Pentecostal babies they didn't like that but you know what he didn't pull no punches when it come to here but would come to maturity through the prophet's message those that stayed in Pentecost they stayed there remember brother Brown said they they wanted to stay in the horse and buggy but we're in the astronaut age they wanted to stay in the automobile but we're in the astronaut age that was a group of people that stood there and they didn't get mature right amen that's right it wasn't that they weren't born Believers either they just didn't move on with God he he he replies to somebody that the Holy Ghost is the same as it was you can't have two different holy ghosts you got one Holy Ghost all right brother Ram said look now look but that predestinated seed don't ask no questions this is 1962 it's thoroughly convinced that it's God moving according to his promise in the Bible a little farther up the road really than isza Street we should be all right he's fixing the Callum Pentecostal babies even even the angel called them Pentecostal babies the angel that was with brother brandham that's right don't get quiet you ought to know that when that Vision came he was fishing got all tied up he said he said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things the church should be up here here is starting here it started with a weeping crying and coming into God and it fell away and here's something up here that the church should be up to meet it when he's talking about up there but yet they're not convinced yet that that's the reason they're not concerned then the countdown you remember the countdown we were talking about we know we're in the astronaut age am all right there was a horse and buggy there was a car there was an airplane and then a rocket now listen justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost horse and buggy automobile hello airplane got them off the ground that ain't all you and I live in an astronaut age remember brother Bram said it took four death Messengers to eat it we just said pomor canor and all those and four life Messengers to bring it back justification satification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word being restored we're sitting today under the word being restored how privileged we are let's don't be horse and buggy how many of y'all came here in a horse and buggy yeah that's what I thought so zusa Street brother Ram is emphasizing the Holy Spirit came in its fullness in other words it came with every gift that they needed everything now watch the Lord revealed to now this is one ey black man this is daddy Seymour or William Seymour the Lord revealed to him that it was the age for the restoration of the gifts and they come no matter what it said it came but everybody got in the atmosphere of it seen it was that age and seen God Vindicated that those people could speak with tongues and so forth but then when he went and pinned it down that this is the only evidence that killed it zza Street lasted till 1915 and actually uh Seymour didn't live much past that I think he died of a heart attack and his wife took over and it just went after that okay then they started separating this that making denominations one coming on the cloud the other one coming in the bush oh there it goes so remember let's piece pull this apart real quick and then we'll we'll close and have our have our meeting will be dismissed and he shall turn this is Malachi he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that's a promise that was John the Baptist that was number three Elijah Elisha John the Baptist everybody with me right he stood and said Behold the Lamb of God who was he talking to he was talking to them old Pharisees that were still under the law everybody with me so the Old Testament fathers the law remember John was standing in the middle of it he was pulling the Old Testament fathers into this new testament way got it so that fulfilled he John the Baptist shall turn the heart of the fathers from the law to this new testament babies want me to tell you that God in Su times and D manner spake in times fast past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he have the pointed air of all things and he made the world First Corinthians and I Brethren could not speak unto you as to spiritual now this is Paul meeting up with the babies again everybody with me Paul's meeting up with the babies again he can't talk spiritual but carnal he's in Corinth even as unto babes in Christ now they weren't babies in the devil they were babies in Christ I have fed you with milk right and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for you are carnal for whereas there is among you envy and strife divisions are you not carnal and walk as men first Peter 2:2 says look as newborn babes okay so John did his job he took the Old Testament law Pharisees and took them and put them into this new era or this New Testament and then God sent Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to carry him on but they had to start his babies right everybody with me but that was a matured word though it went into the ground as we talked about in the fourth Church age it come back on isusa Street to what back to untrained babies the fathers were gone they had they had left it back here because what's the fa of the fathers it's the true word of God in the first three church it's the true word of God there was no denomination inside in it it was the true word of God then man got involved all right now then here's me and you cuz remember this is the second part of Malachi and the Heart what's a heart soul and the Heart of the children back to the fathers in Pentecost original Pentecost lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse so brother brandham goes to Pentecostal babes and takes some to maturity he didn't see it all we're the mature group sitting here I hope I'm praying I know but now watch he said you're using the wrong end of the string this is the Angel talking to brother brandham in The Vision in 1956 and I looked down on the floor and they laid truly there laid the string oh went out to a nice eighth of an inch and taped down real nice and he he said now brother brandham he said the angel said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said you'll cause carnal impersonations now that's true we know it did unfailing word of God he goes to 1964 he tells the same vision but remember the seals have opened we we'll end right here come on you musicians the seals have been opened in 196 before so watch he tells the same vision but he adds something to it now I remember what he promised that it would continue on and not long ago a vision he promised that that pull of that line said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things and when I made the third pull all right so he's in the third pull part of his ministry he said I don't tell nobody about this you've been trying to explain that other don't tell nobody about this this is a great and final pull let's take stand at her feet he tried to teach the Pentecostals they wouldn't listen to him all they loved the gifts they loved all that but they left the giver out they kicked brother randam out they kicked him literally out that's right thousands down to 20 or 30 people that would even listen to him and what did all the commentaries even Gordon Lindsay was right there with him for about 10 or 15 years but when brother R started preaching he left him you ought to read that Auda Street book it's in there in the office sister Anna marunga gave it to me a while back but you ought to read that how they come in and then you had your John G Lakes you had FF Bosworth you had Smith Wigglesworth you had brother brandham you had or Roberts Billy Graham uh AA Allen they put every one of them in there but what in brother brandham they just kind of leaves it leave it at the gifts they don't say anything about his ministry you can't you can't deny he had a a gift of Divine Healing can't deny it there's millions of people can't deny it and the tapes you can't deny but boy when he started preaching the word of God see that's what separated it when he started taking them back to the faith of the fathers amen when he was trying to pull them out of that Pentecostal baby's business lined the gifts up he even told the Tabernacle one time he said when y'all get these gifts lined up he said something will happen and we'll read it this afternoon where he talks about going into Rapture keeps Church clean it takes the gifts not just speaking in tongues because honestly when I say the gifts what's the first thing you think of speaking in tongues right amen you think well that's not that's the last of the nine what about wisdom we're going to read them this afternoon wisdom Faith knowledge yes all those things got to be working too and then the least of the gifts is speaking in tongues and interpretations let's sing a song God bless you we'll get to it this afternoon oh I am blessed have a need real quick I am [Applause] blessed oh every day that I live I am blessed and when I wait wake up in the morning when I lay my hand to rest I am [Applause] blessed oh I am blessed through the sunshine and ring even sorrow in pain Jesus still is my
