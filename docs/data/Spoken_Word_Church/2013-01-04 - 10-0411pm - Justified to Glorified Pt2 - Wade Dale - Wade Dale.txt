========================================

for you me your sary you're GL and with thank I'll be your Liv sary for you that's what we were talking about amen living Sanctuary rightl something God can live in amen that's the mystery of this whole thing am how a bunch of people that doesn't look like much but we're exactly what he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah the exact image that he saw is standing here today right or he changed right and he does not change right you love the Lord well getting that together we'll T remember next weekend parents just said to remember to get Daddy 70 something probably I told him the other day I said it's kind of I think me and sister Peggy Gibby were talking about something and I said yeah it's kind of strange you start out with no teeth of Bibb and Dippers and you end the same way so maybe somebody can get him 70 diapers or bibs somebody give him that's somebody give Mom and Daddy a a a John Deere bib somebody here at church did I think and that's what they wear when we go somewhere they put that bib on so that U they don't get any food on their their clothes so I'm sure I'll hear from that may not be here next week I'll be maybe it's the truth truth in turn to the Book of Romans and we'll get started again I hope you enjoy this morning um now let's apply it to our life and go on um you know I I was thinking back there just now that that before you're born again you don't you can't backslide cuz you're lost but you can backslide in here right staying backslid means you never got anything to start with it's not backsliding you're just lost right but if you're backsliding then you come back oh what a wonderful thing when that man saw his son coming back the prodical son he saw him coming back in the fold and much more God thans of you and I amen when he sees that we fall then all of a sudden he sees us stand right back up yes sir that's one thing the devil can't understand he can't understand how that you can get knocked down and get right back up and say thank you Lord for that trial that I just went through the book of Romans we'll start back and read the the 30th ver but U let's bow our head before we begin dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for another time and opportunity to come and serve you we pray now Lord that You' come again in a mighty way heal the sick bind up the Brokenhearted help the wounded Lord just may we become more of a reflection of you heart just be with us and keep us safe be a dad Lord as he ministers now and Tennessee and bless him Lord bless the congregation here Lord that will hear and receive Lord something from you let it not be a man Lord but it be the Holy Spirit moving and using a vessel Lord one more time father though we be a Cast Away Lord may you help someone in this building today Lord take this and and put it in their heart and plant it and let it grow father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord we know we coming down to the End of Time Lord but we see Lord that you've give us you give us armor you give us a protection and it's your word and we thank you for it Lord we can go back in and see the promises of God that's been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ just bless us and be with us forgive us of our sin in Jesus name we pray amen Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things let's all read that together if you don't mind if God be before us who can be against us you may SE word if the Lord before us who can be against us Brother Richard asked me that I want to race that I said no I don't know where I'd start at but and this morning let's just kind of background just for a minute but uh we were talking about justification in baby form sanctification in the baby form and then the baptism of the holy ghost in a baby form because when the baby's born the baby has all that they need to take them into the journey but you must go through the Journey all right you must grow in Grace and knowledge you must grow even Jesus Christ in a human body the Bible says he grew in faith and stature and he was perfected in what he saw here on the earth and walking as God Almighty walking through the Earth as you and I not having to go through these things because he was already almighty God he was already Eternal in his soul and then he had to come down into a body of Flesh that was not Eternal and he had to learn the Bible says by the things he suffered that he grew in stature if you read the Bible it didn't say he grew in Statue that's this way statue is this way stature is what we're talking about the stature of a perfect man not a statue all right but he was The Headstone he was the fullness he was all this rolled up into one man and the reason that we can go and be the same person is because now that man that done all that force is now living inside of us okay that's why you and I can't do it ourselves we have to have help we have to have God Christ himself to come in the form of the Holy Spirit to come into your body amen and to be in your soul and and and brother dick and I were talking today it's kind of like these virtues I don't like the lines same way with Body Spirit and soul if you don't if you cut yourself in two there's not one ring two rings you know a third ring that's where you soul is no this is all a body and once you are born into this world B RN into this world that's just you amen okay but there has to be a starting point for God to work in because without a soul you'd be an animal right all right animal doesn't have a soul an animal is just by Nature Nature um rules him but he has a body of Flesh just like me and you right as I've said many times before sister Brandon I wondered why God if if he wanted to create through the spoken word why did he give us a body with the body parts to bring it through sex on in the Earth we're just a higher form of animal right God it would be this complimentary for God to make a man and a a male dog female dog male bear female bear and then make me and you just be nothing no he made us in the same order gave us the same parts we got no different parts than a dog or a cat as far as hands they're just made a little different same way with all our other organs so we're just a higher form of animal except there's one thing about us God thought so so much of us that he made us a soul he gave us life all right and he gave us a choice right even Cain he gave Cain a choice if you'll do right right then I'll Bless you that's right right so here we are in a body that we're living in now and and you can't once you once God comes in and gives you a soul that at Birth your natural birth then he can't you can't divide any of the three right the only thing that divides the three is death natural it takes what's inside of you and puts in another dimension and this guy stays here because it's in the fall all right there's a bar that's holding your body here because your body is connected to this Natural Earth but now your soul and spirit goes into another dimension but you can't take your spirit out of you or you're dead can't take your soul out of you because that's the you that's that's what motivates that's us that's what you see that makes this move so there's not any but just for for purpose of us being human the prophet had to draw one Circle for the man and one Circle for the spirit and one Circle for the soul but you can't separate them now once God put that in my body that's why brother R said he said I have a problem with people believing this transmigration Reincarnation of souls because once that soul is put in in this body of me that's why this scripture can be fulfilled brother dick that's why he can say those he who has Justified he is already glorified if not if we were going to get a new body like most people teach and a lot of people in the message think this body just going to be thrown away and we're going to get a brand new one then you do away with that scripture cuz those who he's Justified he's already glorify all right so you and I are bringing ourself or he's bringing us under subjection to the word of God I'll read it to you in just just a minute Brother Gary and I were discussing something and actually kind of helped me put a little punctuation mark on here by going back to the greatest battle ever fought which that is the greatest battle ever fall right it's in your mind if you're born again it's not in your soul that's right it's in your mind all right so we'll get to that in a second because you're going to see that we're going to take lonox man and Eagle because these four death Messengers eat the eat the eat the uh the tree down and then the four life Messengers are going to bring it back but to catch back up now we' come up to Faith and here we're born again it starts your journey you're a born again Christian in your soul you're just as Eternal as God is you know if you die you go right straight into that sixth Dimension but the ones of us that are still alive we got work to do right all right the ones that are dead and go on there's nothing you can do about it but you and I are here and you and I have been right here moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called right right he's called this age or called you this people amen he's called you to this sir does everybody understand that right he's called you to this that's right right he didn't call you to be a Baptist right he didn't call you to be a Brandi he calls you to be Christ that's right have the mind of not the mind of a man not the mind of anyone else but the mind of Christ and here's our journey then our journey began we talk about this morning our journey truly began when we were born again and we started listening to the word of God because the word of God the Bible says we are Washed by the Water of the word am when brother Bram saw the dream or or sister Shepherd had the dream and brother Bram saw it himself he saw what a man pouring water into a basin right which was up here he was pouring water in that Bas and what was coming out he said it was trash right okay right sister Gwen brought and I'm glad I like feedback I brothers or sisters kids it doesn't matter but sister Gwen was saying that that brother hter a long time ago brother R said there would be a message sweep out right to end this thing right we think about sweep ACR no why don't we take a broom and let's sweep out that's right that's what these virtues are doing that's why when that man was pouring that water in which was the word right what was coming out trash right what was coming out the trash side of this right the white horse rider was riding away what the one that was trying to impersonate okay that's anti right that's what you want to see riding away the Antichrist of this but the real Christ is going to make you white red black and pale all right and we'll go through it just now all right so we got the justification and we show that if you're truly Justified you're just as righteous as God God said that I didn't so he's making you the very righteousness of God and then it shows that all that nonsense is being pushed out same way in sanctification we see in sanctification and I I was uh we were talking downstairs and you know there's a lot of people that we were talking about here at sanctification that that that thinks they're born again and and that's a real real horrible place to be but that's where a lot of your foolish burdens are going to come from the reason I believe that is because if you're if you're caught out into those denominations now don't get me wrong there are there are dispensations of time when brother Brandon was preaching he was preaching to a dispensation that he was bringing them from the old Pentecostal and bringing them into the new way or his or his age all right bride age it didn't say that they weren't bride right all right but he was bringing them from the old father Son and Holy Ghost baptism because remember FF Bosworth brother R say was a great man of Faith spent two hours shaking hands with his convert so we know he went to heaven but he was a trinitarian he never accepted water baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ why brother Brown said that they were some caught back in another age that's why I believe in 1977 something did happen in 1977 the Gentile age ceased he said it would be the what the going up of the Gentile bride return of Christ to the Jews in 1977 I believe that old dispensation is over that's just my guess because after 77 brother Brown said you know better now you know better to be a woman preacher now you know better to be baptized in name father son Holy Ghost but These Foolish virgins a virgin is somebody that's virgin to the word of God and to be virgin to the word of God you can't be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and know that and be a virgin that's right because brother BR says anybody baptized name Father Son and Holy Ghost has taken a whse forehead all right but that was God went at that while the prophet was preaching he wied that in but now he calls everybody to repentance everybody should know that that baptism will not get you anywhere so a lot of people a lot of foolish version I believe going to come out of this message because this message is the most pure thing that there is amen and they can accept so much of it be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ walk as much as they can but like brother dick said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell why because you never accepted that right there that God did it and you have faith in what God did not what you did you had faith in what God did amen and see they can't even get that right in the message cuz they saying that he's just a man and then he become God and then he come back to a man again see that confuses people you can't grow you're only as high as your pastor is right I didn't say that to Prophet did you can't go beyond your pastor so if he believes that then guess what you can't go any further than that right so he took you to another God let me tell you something if we were to preach this thing brother dick line by line the way it should be y'all would be mad at me the world would be mad at most people because if you preach this thing the way it should be you know one time somebody said brother Brown said we got to get back to where they said that's not what Paul said right we got to get back to where we look at him and say that's not what we brand was talking about right because you know what he called us all to do something that's why he said those who he predestinated I read just a minute in the greatest battle L fault where he has equipped us for the battle see that's what we're doing right now we're equ we're being equipped for the battle cuz the greatest battle is going to be right up here in the mind the head part all right our hair is going to be in the head part that's right but it's only realizing that what got you started is ending it right right all right excuse me so now we come to sanctification here same way here but you're born again but we were talking about too that you could be blinded uh like the preacher was that that that you know wanted to beer and and brother R God took his servant off the scene so he wouldn't Mar his name uh there's a part in the Bible that you can turn someone over to the devil remember for the destruction of their what flesh so that their soul could be saved all right so that means that they're already born again they just got up in somewhere and somewhere the word's not letting that junk come out that's where a lot of me and you are right on that's right come on people that's where a lot of me and you are we're not letting this word do it we think we can do it we think we've been in a message all our life you got to have an experience with God people right a true experience something you can when the Devil Comes you can say yes St I've had enough of that stop all right so now we come to sanctification the red horse rider he literally killed millions of people 68 million people were killed in during the time of the Dark Ages when that red horse rider was writing but thank God the blood of Jesus Christ has Sanctified Millions yes amen since he was on the cross his blood has Sanctified millions of people and put them in the body of Christ put them in into a uh um you know I want to say the faith of the fathers which is true we'll get to that in a second get ahead on then the black horse rider the black horse rider was death we remember we could name him that then brother Ram comes up on the Statue of a perfect man I didn't read it this morning but I found it so I'll read it statute of perfect man 1962 now building The Virtue building this Monument building this statue see it starts off in the foundation that's on faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God and His brotherly kindness now what's it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things yes sir right in here right in here see I got in between all these Works in here there's a little W coming down what is it the holy ghost coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off what's it been done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven Church Messengers so he's telling you why he wrote Holy Spirit right here okay because that's what's going to mold everything together remember what we said these three in one right now what is God he's three in one he's not three persons but he's three manifestations that horse rider is the last one right right and he rides off brother R said after that the Rapture takes place right right all these three in one well guess what all these three in one right everybody understand that's kind of simple isn't it all three in one that we're not talking about we're see we see four things but it's three manifested because four death Messengers which were these people the the the H can word you can actually put them in each one of these there's a sermon on that too but I I'll sa that one for later but you can put those death Messengers right in here with these horse riders where they eat away all the fellowship they eat away just the joy they do all that that's exactly what happened right here all right but for Life Messengers comes and brings it back which is what we started this morning you got the lion that come out in the first Age The Lion Spirit come out l i o n for those of you on the internet not lying lion Spirit went forth preaching what the true white word of God cuz it was pure back in the first age it was pure in the second age it was pure in the third age but the devil started coming back and brother Brown said he got off his White Horse and got on his red horse and started killing people during the O age right right o is what slow sacrificial all right kind of funny that it takes a red heer though to make sacrifice and that's during the red time of the red horse rider then you got the man which was what coming out with Luther and Wesley coming up into the intelligence of of man bringing this together amen then what do you end up with now all these are Earthbound creatures right right now you got a lion an ox a man in other words you got a lion he can't see but maybe to to that door is down here Ox is a little bit higher he can see a little bit further the man we stand up we can see way out further but you can't see any further than an eagle and to show you the growth development of an individual this little young right here starts out with what he becomes a meat eater but he starts out with milk that's right what this one start out with what do this one start out with but what does this one start out with Hallelujah that's good Lon starts out drinking milk amen then he eats meat o meat then goes to Grass man milk steak but when you come to that eagle he starts out eating meat that's why you see a progression of God in each one of these things this right here is not skim milk people right right when you come to that position position you're standing like Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but such that I have I give unto you see we're way behind our privileges we think man we're way up here because brother Brown said we were in The Headstone he might have been the rest of us weren't right but we got to be to where we can eat some meat now even start out eating meat because what we're going to do is is we're going to start right back over all in three three stages three stages three stages three stages completes the birth down here three stages completes a birth here three stages is going to bring this head down and he's not going to come down on somebody drinking milk all right milk is right here now let don't get me wrong I still like milk but if you put a glass of milk and a Murphy steak the glass of milk could root I'm not saying let's do away with the milk because you know what I might reach and grab that glass of milk and eat when a St drink a St those of you been to Murphy know what I'm talking about I wish they had a way to get it out here be bigger than I am now but God wants us to grow in Christians just like we grow in individual people right so we've come to a place to where that God has molded this together because if you're not strong down here that's why brother said he had these waves that's why the Holy Spirit Wells this together if you got a little place right here that you got to Gap guess what's going to happen when this pressure comes down boom pressure comes right here boom what's going to happen you're going to rupture that's why brother R said that Holy Spirit welding it together all right see right here people and I'm going to say this and and say it pretty strong if we think we are here or if we decide that this is where we want to be this is not something that is the same as down here but yes it is but this down here is a baby a babbling baby that has to be led fed told what to do amen now this right here is not that right this is Faith of the fathers not faith of the babies right faith of the fathers that's what it says fathers not babies that's right faith of the fathers means the father has grown up right he's looking back and helping the babies right but he's come to a position to where God can use him as a father that he can look and see what the Father which is Christ wants to do with his word but people we got to realize these things right here have to be added or out of us the liono man an eagle they start out sure drinking a little milk but they have to all come to be meat eaters but when that eagle comes he's eating meat all the time he don't even look for milk I an eagle don't even have a um um what would you call a breast or anything like that an eagle eats meat Mama goes and gets the fish babies open their mouth they stick it down in the mouth but now one time see you can take that and type that is coming up to here and still having to be fed mouth fed right what we're doing now feeding from the mouth there comes a time when that eagle grows up and he goes and gets his own food that's right right but he don't go outside to get his own food his mama teaches him where to hunt that's right who's your mama New Jerusalem which is the word of God all right so we do have a mother and a father we have God which is our father and the Bible says our mother is New Jerusalem which is the word of God so we don't leave the word of God in any of this we don't leave the word of God out we're actually adding more word in all right now let's back up just one second now here we come this justification we know we did right right I'm erasing this you just kind of think a little bit about what's been said I'll write that again got to get this clean take it back downstairs all right this justification we know we done it there's no doubt we done it right and we have witnesses that we done it right right this justification there's no doubt we've done it but God is showing us by grace that it's all right that we did do it because we're coming to a place that is as if we never right as if now we've not come to the real you not doing it yet this is as if we never done it now that's why that's the little prosecute Woman Jesus knew for a fact that they were still under the law and when they threw that girl down in front of him that they said we caught her in the act of adultery they were Witnesses right right right we caught her in the act of adultery right what do you say so we know what Jesus done he stalled he stalled long enough for the Holy Spirit I believe to start speaking to those people right and they look back through their life and they saw what they had done so when they left Jesus you know he said you know he who has sin cast the first stone well now if one person had have stay one person right think about this if one person had a stayed Jesus would have had to Stone right cuz that was a witness that's right because in the Old Testament you had to have a witness that's right okay what he say it was a witness right right now Jesus turns around and says woman where are your accusers she looked around she said I have none you say well there was almighty God standing there in human flesh but Jesus did not see her do that that's right that's right oh if you can see that sir oh if you could just see that oh my that lady he she turn he turned around he said lady I didn't see you do it right right go and sin no more right but if one man would have stood there and said I witnessed it I saw it Stoner he would have had the stoner right right but when God gets R of your accuser he turns around and looks at you and says what did you do I didn't see you do it we're getting somewhere amen cuz real you didn't do it to start with right but you going to have accusers until then that's right but hang on a minute but that little woman Jesus told her to go and sin no more and I believe she did I don't know what ever happened to her but I don't believe she did what she done before but we come from justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit in the in the pyramid and we see that Christ comes down and molds everything together makes you a walking instrumentality of God but we're not finished yet we still have to get rid of our accusers right our accuser there's really only one accuser of the brethren and that's the devil all right but now look justification to glorification so we got to start and we got to see that in The Headstone of the the the building of this Temple there was or the building of this statue there was not a head put on it right right it was left right it was left level you know right here all right but there has to be something come that's different say different not different remember brother brand said it's got to either be in the word or it's anti christ it's all got to be in the word of God and we know to save a little time we not read it but now we look and see justification in The Headstone and we wonder how we going to get to there well there's a few more seals left if you don't mind remember this is the first seal second seal third seal fourth seal right what about the fifth seal you said what's that got to do with me well in the fifth seal if you want to read it we not read it stay some time brother Rand comes up to a group of people that has actually turned God down right and they're called a fifth seal Jew now you and I are Jews spiritually they were they're going to they're a natural set of Jews all right let me back up just a minute the natural set of Jews to put them in this fifth seal sold under the altar crying how long how long to avenge our blood see abing and Christian doesn't do that right Bing and Christian says how long how long but when you put to a blood then it brings in a whole different group of people all right because they were not born again that fifth seal Jew was not born again they were given eternal life by the grace of almighty God so what's that got to do with us when you get to the point that the real you didn't do it to start with if that ain't Grace right unmerited favor nothing you done that's right to deserve it you say well that's the same as this down here I told you eternity is in a circle right you just keep going around you're just going to keep going around and around and around there's no difference from this one to this one except the position that God has you in in the word of God right this is a baby form this is the form how in the world can you get eternal etal life and those people get eternal life turning God down it had to be Grace right brother R says he said it's the great greatest Grace seal I'll read it just a second right here listen it says in the fifth seal 1963 they realized they murdered their Messiah now same way with me and you we come to a real ization something here right see they were guilty of murder so they got murdered but being that they were blinded by God his grace reached down to them talk about Amazing Grace and gave each one of them a robe I don't see anything else if it's not Grace people you want to prove it turn to Zach it's a hard one for me to find right before Malachi that four verse six then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayi the Lord of host who art thou oh great Mountain before jerub Thou shalt become a flame and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof the shouting crying what that's enough for me great brother BR said one time he said if we knew what the grace of God was he said we'd take a RT amen and that's what it is we're still here because we're not we don't get the grace of God like we should right but we got to be like them fifth seal Jews we got to be able to accept Grace accept that robe except what God's already done for us see everybody thinks well boy it's going to get greater and we're going to have to jump through hoops brother R said it's just a change but right there when I was reading that I thought well you go back to zerubabel and that's what he said he said he shall bring forth The Headstone and that's what that is right amen with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it this guy never did it that's right why he shows him those Jews how can God give them eternal life and see what they done they turned down the Messiah right they literally physically killed him physically they put him to death but just because of me and you he blinded that group of people Y and they're going to have to accept the grace that they don't know anything about amen so they never did it in the first place right right all these right here you're going to see one thing this has one thing to do talking about this right we come to this place in Divine Healing brother BR said no Divine Healing nor Resurrection now when brother Brandon was Discerning um say a lady and she had u a tumor cancer he called one time a spider cancer it was all in her stomach and he pronounced her heal now if you were to take an x-ray of that lady God just didn't take that out like a surgeon would and leave scars he actually restored those cells back to its original condition that's right right same way with the man that that cut off you know Peter cut off the ear Jesus reached and grabbed that ear and I believe he put it right back on and I don't believe there's no there was no Telltale sign that that had ever happened right right see say well what what are you getting to we got to believe it that's right that's why he said no Divine Healing no Resurrection God doesn't just patch things up right when he heals you he restores you back to original condition hallelujah amen that's what the headstone is people right it's restoration back to original condition you said well brother random died listen there's a lot more to go with this I'm just trying to get us to this point okay we can get to this point we're going to live a lot better life all right so let's just kind of take this step by step and it's kind of like Daddy said Wednesday night which that we were talking about Thursday and um Jesus was glorified right in front of the people in front of the three Witnesses right and but he went on to death right but you and I have to realize one one thing from that condition forward he was doing it to get us right herebody understand that he was doing it to get us right here he went through all the Death Barrel Resurrection Ascension and all that so that you and I don't have to go through if we accept it amen but his body was glorified on that mountain that's what the Bible say that's where your glorification is going to come from that's we we'll we'll get into that maybe later or I know D but justification in The Headstone we must realize that we never did it to start with it's not even held accountable now let me tell you something if this is true justification down here in the baby form that's the same as that right that's right those who he has truly Justified yes sir he's already glorified that's right amen that's why people this is going to be so simple I know everybody wants some big swelling ending to this story but it's just going to be this right here put right here and then your journey in between y because God don't seek justification and glorification that's what God say right he sees that right there right if he saw in between he'd have to kill all of us right right that's right but he sees you Justified sees you glorified one condition right here but if he saw the journey in between he would have to kill us thank God for the blood now same way when we get here the sanctification what was the six seal we can get in all this stuff board's not big enough what was the six seal the prophet said the six seal was a total Interruption of nature when those two prophets come on the scene they open that six seal they bring fire out of Heaven they bring we've been studying it a little bit downstairs in the Book of Daniel he said they open that seal when they want to earthquakes Blood Fire whatever want they want to happen well guess what if they do it in the natural you and I have to have it in the spiritual for it to happen to Israel in the natural it has to happen to us in the spiritual first because we're spiritual Israel correct right then the world gets theirs so see it's in 3 to we get it Jews get it the Earth gets it right all in three everything you do should be in three right six brother Brown say it was a total Interruption of nature now he's talking talking about the nature in what the Earth the nature of the Earth all right nature like mother nature like trees and what about mine and your nature he's going to interrupt your nature that's right when your hand moves God's hand mov amen your foot moves I read you that quote this morning God's foot moves CU brother was coming to the end he was coming to charity and that's what he was talking about he said when your hand moves God hands move when your eyes see then God's eyes see God's going to interrupt your nature that's why brother R could see he could he saw that that the real will Bram didn't do it his nature had been interrupted or changed because he said I'm not the son of Charles N brown anymore he wasn't deny we can't deny our birth right right you can't deny your spiritual birth right but you just come to a place that that birth here has took you to a place to where therefore let's read Romans I let's read Romans again but Paul was positive you say okay I'm putting it all in the Bible Romans 8 verse one there is therefore now in my Bible have I have now Circle there is therefore now no it didn't say a little bit a pinch a half a quarter it says no right right there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I don't have to read nothing El when are we going to start believing that amen when we start thinking right when those flu get blown out amen because right now today actually this is what I'm trying to do right interrupt your nature and let it totally be changed because we need it I need it you need it we all need to be changed if we don't get changed here we're not going to get changed in the end or the change of the body but the word of God interrupts my nature every time I come to church it does and if it doesn't then there's something wrong with you but that's carrying on us hot is it is it any more now now look if this step down here is this big we take one step what's this step up here just the next step that's right yeah not a little B step and then a beer step that you got to really get way up here no it's a daily walk that's right right but you build one on top of the other amen right you can't start up here that's right right you can't miss a step that's right but I want you to see today we're going to finish but I want to come back just right here I want us to see today though even through all this all this Interruption of this chart is I want you people I want you to see if you're right here there's something you can do about it right right and if you're right here there's something you can do about it even if you're right here there's still something you can do about it right but it's a journey amen it's a journey up that God has said right here in Romans 8 turn you turn it over one more time moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called right and whom he called them he also Justified and if he justified you if God truly Justified you then he truly is going to glorify you all right brother Ram you know he said take you out of the back side of the desert give you something for the people brother randam I believe was taken up over there in 1963 and he was taken up into a position that he received the headstone which was his adoption and he was I glorified if you want if you're taking up in a vision there's something changing about you it's not you're not a normal person I promise you that if you're taking up in seven angels and you're taking up in it physically he said he was lifted up he got something out there that you and I are going to have to go through but maybe not as dramatic as he did because he was a prophet bringing something to you and I but I still believe that we're going to have to come to place that we know that we know that we know that we not just write this on a piece of paper and real you never did that's right until we get out of here that accuser is going to blast us and blast us and blast us and blast us and then when he finished blasting us he's going to blast us again right then after he's done with that he's going to blast us again right don't you listen right here we get back to sanctification and six listen to this in 1963 paragraph 409 the six seal now I want you to read with me as you do capture scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the Sixth Seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seal all together is one great big book just six Scrolls R together rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole Earth was redeemed now who's got to be redeemed first who's got to be redeemed first right you and I that's right you and I have to be redeemed first so this is your book of redemption this is how you are to be redeemed and the prophet said six seals finishes Redemption right right after six seals there's no more Redemption is over six seal finishes Redemption but you got to have one more guy which this is what most people don't understand about the seventh seal he said it's a secret no one will know it but who yourself that's right your own person that's right you're the only person that's going to know when he comes so you got four seals fifth seal Grace Sixth Seal that's all this right here is that same way with here what are you doing you're interrupting the nature you have right here okay same thing right here what is this what is justification Grace that I still got this dirty old hand that I used to carry a beer around in right that I'm ashamed of right but look it now holds a Bible it now prays for people but you know what that's something I got to get over cuz God didn't see that other part that's right all he sees is the blood justification Grace justification it's the grace of God that he lets you go up through here and get get his divine nature sanctification same way interrupts your nature and keeps interrupting people that right there same thing here right right faith faith right Rapture and Faith right we don't have Rapture and faith yet that's right that is rap in faith brother R said the devil there's one thing he cannot impersonate that's he does not know how to be born again that's right right remember if he knows how to be born again he could be our brother but he does not know how to be born again listen right here 7 SE paragraph 557 now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidden to write about it even write a symbol about it why this is why there's no activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven Thunders now notice when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpet there is one Thunder when Israel was gathered there was a trumpet when time shall be no more the last trumpet one Thunder but there's seven straight Thunders Right In A Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that perfect number seven thunders in a row uttered not making just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even Straight then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on it's a relaxing time it was so great till it secret kept from the Angels now why if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage there's one thing he don't know now he can interpret anything he wants to and imp perate any kind of gift I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret all right let's read on a little further the next paragraph if you want something to happen now you have to take my word for this I'm planning on doing something I know better to tell anybody about it not that that person will tell it but Satan will hear it see he can't get it in my heart there as long as God's got it closed up with the holy spirit so it's between me and God right right amen it's an individual affair with God here it's an individual affair with God here and it's an individual affair with God here when we walk out of here it's going to be individual Affair but everybody wants to know what this great seventh seal is the Bible says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are SE sealed unto the name of your Redemption right that's what the great seventh seal is it's the culmination of this right here cuz Satan doesn't have faith if Satan had Faith he could have a revelation he have a revelation he'd be born again why do you think he keeps fighting oh he believes but he his belief is a hope remember Hope's not very good unless you hoping toward you're hoping toward something right but this right here is the same as this same as this same as this it's a secret because I can stand here all day and I could tell you I could write it on the board I could try to explain it but unless God reveals it to you it's still a secret it's still a secret so God reveals it to you right but he made two statements right here that that gets to me he talks about angels and the devil that's the only two people that can't be born again right the Angels didn't know anything about this people that's why they were silent they don't have to go through this right the Angels know nothing about they they're standing around the walls today shaking their head wondering how somebody can be lost they look at them lost over here and then they look at them doing what we're doing today you can understand that the devil same way he looks over here and sees how what happened over here and he sees what's happening over here and he can't understand it right it's a secret the mighty glorification of man that was once lost and now God put them in a place to where they never did it to start justification to glorification let me read you one more quote greatest batt Ever Fall paragraph 12 and so an Army first in getting ready for a battle first just got to select some soldiers Romans 8 says moreover them he who he predestinated him he called it he called a group of soldiers first he's got to call you select some soldiers they got to be dressed for a fight they got to be trained for a fight and I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start this great first battle that was ever fought was in heaven then the battle begin down here on Earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since paragraph 25 the great hour of charge is at hand Hallelujah Soldiers with armor gleaming color Streaming Faith and doubt is setting the themselves in array in this Tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers stand at your post of Duty hallelujah our captain the Morning Star leads on he never goes back he never don't know the word Retreat he don't have to retreat the greatest battle ever fought she's going on right in here right now amen that's right right now yes sir paragraph 55 see Satan's attack watch listen close as closing his attack is what disbelieving God's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle that's ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God now why didn't he put Satan God in you your zero out Satan and God and what Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon which is what the sword of the word of God he disarms you let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's disarmed you oh brother Neville I hope you never dis believe that look he disarms you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't you lay it down we see his unbelief and he said one more thing he wants to say before closing he give you a sword right here yes brother went out Tucson something struck his hand he said it was a sword but he said not only a sword that you have to have in a battle he said you have to have a mighty strong hand of Faith to hold on to that sword that's right he said when you're in battle he said it's the strong man with the strongest arm amen that pierces the heart of the enemy when you leave here today realize one thing if you're right here there's a word here in this church I believe that can teach you all the way up to St you a perfect man yes sir that's right there's a lot of places that this would blow people's mind it's been in a message for years I've seen it people I go around the world I go around I have been around the world almost but in this church the Holy Spirit has led this church and us to show us these things this is not new people this ain't nothing that ddy had already preached he just had maybe put it on the chart for a visual to see he's preached every bit of this for 20 something years this a something new right all right but maybe if I put it in in a little bit of a a visual form you can see it a little better three stages here three stages here three stages here said three stages completes the birth wherever you are today takes that home with you U it'll be on the internet go got it on on the uh video there and it'll be on the internet uh if you want to study it again but to receive the headstone is to receive Christ here first justification glorification right receiving Christ as your savior here receiving Christ as your savior here this right here makes you and him one that's right all together one all together one the true baptism of the Holy Spirit not another baptism not just believing the message not just saying I'm in the message not just believing well you know that's what brother Brown said I like quotes and quotes are strength to back up what God's bringing right because it come to a prophet and it was God speaking it but if you don't have put if you can't put it in your life it does not do any good to shout about brother rown doing all these great things it does not matter what our pastor does all these great things unless you take what that is and build on it as far as having faith yes right what did Brother randam say he said Divine Healing was to reach out and get the people's attention right Amen to see what divine healing all to see the word that's right and that's going to take you from Divine Healing why brother Brown said Divine no Divine Healing no Resurrection cuz when we come back when when when they come back if their glorified body they're not going to have limbs Mission they're not going to have an old part of them still there gray hair and what kind of God do we serve when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead Mary said Master he stinketh now when he was raised from the dead and Jesus told him to take his grave clothes off you believe he was stinking then you know brother brandham many times you know he'd say talking about Lazar Soul where it was at where it went I thought about his body cu the soul was okay right that body for days was stinking bloating skin worms had already begun brother said his nose had fell in but with one voice Lazarus didn't come out doing this right no I believe he came out and the Bible says that the grave cloth he was trying to get them grave clothes off they bind them up you know wrap them up real real tight he was trying to get those grave clothes off and Jesus said said loose him and let him go and when he did I believe that he probably was uh I know he was sit like this well praise the Lord I'm alive I don't know what happened but I'm alive no I believe you couldn't stop him because remember they were getting ready to kill him remember the Bible says that when Jesus and him went to a a meal the the Pharisees well you know what he went sitting there going can you ra me from the dead no everybody must have knew it cuz they was trying to kill him to shut him up too I mean you read between the lines in the Bible and you can see a lot of things goes on that that wasn't recorded but Lazarus must have struck a cord somewhere because he had been dead and he was restored back right same thing with you and I amen we were dead in sin trespasses but one day what did God do he said I will Resto amen sir that's why we've had to go through all this people because we fell in the garden right and as we fell in the garden that put us under a condition that now when God came back down to earth and walk through the through the uh Trials of life just like we do all this was going on when Jesus was walking on the Earth right don't think these writers are new no people are are devils the devil was right there when he was born trying to kill him at 2 years old right devil was trying to destroy him even took him at at 30 years old and tried to get him to relinquish his kingdom and do all these things so if he did that to to to the Lord Jesus Christ himself you and I are not going to be IM I'll promise you that but just realize one thing people let's be honest with ourselves if we can identify ourselves somewhere in all this then we can do something about it but if you just say oh that's a bunch of drawings I know that I've got the Holy Spirit and and because I got signs and wonders and right uh the Bible even says there when he's talking about false Christ he say they would do great signs and wonders but take this home with him in your mind and ask God I think the problem is that we get settled back sometimes and we think well we're done we're finished we're in the seventh Church age we've got all this great Revelation these preachers can preach so good and we can feel so good and somebody can get us so anointed the devil can anoint you right that's right to do the wrong thing that's right you watch brother rown when he's in a prayer line he never raises his voice he talks to them demons just like me and you are talking I've seen people in the message Shake people wig off their head and I'm not saying that to be silly but how's that going to how's that going to affect anything Jesus never went to the grave of Lazareth and started screaming and even said father I pray for them around me not that I need to pray and that what he said he said but for those around me I'm going to pray and then he said Lazarus come forth one day he's he's actually doing the same thing for you and I right here that's right he's calling your name y he saying Donnie yes sir the real you come forth right cuz all this is doing remember remember brother brand took those seals and he rolled them up in a roll and he said here's seal number one and he pulled it off and it flipped open that's exactly what's happening to me and you right six seals finishes Redemption there's Seven Seals not written in the Bible it's hi and where is it hi and a bunch of people that come to church some of you drive four M 4 hours to get here some of us can't carry tun in the bucket some of us can't play banjo worth a flip some of us can't preach worth a flip I'm not finished yet but I'm going to be serious God didn't choose you for all that that's right he chose you because he loved you he chose you because he knew in your heart that you'd accept him and you'd do better and youd walk in the word you do what he says you were what an obedient child all this right here that something I didn't get to but it's obedience right I like Old Samuel he told Saul he said said kill them all he said don't even leave a sheep Y and definitely kill that oneeyed King but what did Saul do he let that one eye King live Y and what Samuel do you said boy these prophets are real sweet people Samuel walked in there one day and he heard the Lambs and he said sa I hear the blat in the Sheep right and I see that oneeyed King still alive right he walked over and he drew Saul's sword and he took it and he went cut that man's head off right in front of him handed the sword back to Saul he said Saul it's greater to be obedient yes than it is to sacrifice those Lambs see Saul I know what Saul was doing he said we'll save a few of these to sacrifice with but that's not what Samuel told him let me get let me get a little closer to home that's that's not what brother Rand told us he said kill him he said hack him up and destroy him because if you don't destroy the Devil he's going to destroy you that's right exactly right this is a battle people amen and the battle's not over till we get out of here but you know what book's already been wrote the battle's already been won amen come the great seventh seal is a walking living human being that sold itself out to God nothing more nothing less it's almighty God walking on two feet let's hope I've said something maybe today that helped your heart I want to sing a song brother dick we sang it before let's try it again it's written in my wonderful

we're going to be Kings and Priests thank you Jesus we got to do one thing people H we got to believe that's it we got to believe we got really I don't think you know brother said the bride does better under persecution or under squeeze you know why course you don't depend on Walmart General Electric right and all those things CU you know what when we get done today we're going to go downstairs first thing we're going to say is we're going to say where youall want to go eat we got to go to Walmart cuz we got to exchange the cell phone that Jun doesn't like but you know thank you like I said this morning there's going to come a time when we may not be able to meet together that's right cuz that time ain't here yet and until that time comes you going to see me sitting there or you going to see see me out preaching the word of God one of the two you say well you can still die and go to hell yeah that's exactly right but if my life shows Christ and I can show it to somebody else brother then he can send me to hell and I'll say I love you that's right amen you got to come that's a position you say that flippantly and then you may go there but hesty goodness I tell the Lord when I walk out that door I said look Lord I said this ain't for me right this is not for me I labored to get this sermon but I hope you get something out of it I've stood here and and had some of the worst thoughts had some of the worst headache had just some of the most viest things come in my head but you know what it ain't so a it didn't happen that's right it ain't in me but I say Lord though I be a cast away that's what Paul was saying Lord if you just cast me in the pit please let me help somebody right let me help somebody today cuz truly Brother Gary knows he's been up here before this is a servant's job this is not something that makes me no better than you people none like we were talking about brother Joe Solace got a little dip of it this morning he taught Sunday school he said man it takes a while to get to get everything together I said yeah we spend about 6 hours to preach one hour and that's about right we spend 6 hours to preach one hour you get two sermons you you spend about 12 hours getting a sermon as far as putting the notes together and praying and then say no this ain't right this don't go here and will this do and and you know will they see this or not see this and it's a labor so we're we're servants don't think anything great of us because the only great thing we can do is get ourselves out the way and let God use our gift I've always wanted to be a teacher I've always wanted to teach people and I lost that out by not going on the school in the natural but maybe I can help somebody here in in this in this part this realm this realm is better than the teacher real outside anyway I couldn't teach him little he aboutus call for he told the people to take the death clo right exactly right you know to me to me well that's our job today these people out there have' got a death cloak on them you know and it's not easy to do you said about the man I shared the qu a baptism for he says I need to be Reb baptized and another guy that I've been sharing with for years you just can't see it or won't do it we got to realize one thing people this is not for everybody that's I mean that's you want you if you have the spirit of God inside of you you want everybody to be saved what do you think about God Almighty walking on the face of the Earth Watching The People reject him knowing that if they would accept him they would accept salvation right and God Almighty himself walking on the earth and if they wouldn't accept God Almighty and you think they're going to accept you all the time no this is not for everybody that's what it's trying to get those ministers to see and I and I know in my heart I want everybody to be saved but they just some people just not going to be like brother dick said you there was a thief on the cross on both sides one accepted the same both of them heard the same message one accepted it one rejected it and that's the way it's going to be anytime one's going to accept one's going to reject you look in in in all your journey you see like that that man one thing you say hey I need to be baptized you talk you can talk to somebody for 5 years about water baptism and they still saying they still ain't going to be baptized name Jes ch right but it's not for us to determine that's right you know just preach the word of God and let God deal with your heart when you go home tomorrow from work and you're tired and weary and worn out sit down and just kind of kick back a little bit and just say God what can I do for you what can I do for you this week tonight I'm sorry tonight for the next week coming up what can I do for you there something I can do lead me into a way to help somebody else right so that's what we are we just Christ died for us we need to die for everybody else true be a sacrifice love the Lord amen thank you for coming appreciate each and every one of you just pray for Dad them they're not coming home tonight they're going to come home in the morning so that's good dad will be wore out we just pray for him remember next Sunday we'll have a u birthday party between services for the uh 70y old man that people calling my brother we were we were in St Augustine I told somebody we were in St Augustine and the sister comes up and said oh I said that's your brother your how's your brother doing I said well I don't know my brother's not here he said oh no that man not there I said that's my father thank you didn't have to laugh that L that's the truth anyway you know what let me tell you something just before we go I know we're a little long but listen you give your life to God he'll protect you if you got something to do in this life he'll do you just like Samuel Dale he'll put you on a path and he'll put you looking 50 when you're 70 but if you don't like I did back 20 years that I stayed away from God I didn't do hard drugs or anything like that but I was a sinner and I did things of the world that's why I look 60 instead of 50 because I didn't take care of myself during that time honor God Amen he'll honor you he's honored that man that man can outwork me sure enough he does look like my brother he really doesn't look like my father he looks like my brother but you just do that you know brother look at brother collie he's had some ups and down you know what he's pretty young looking d l a little weight give a little more hair he look you know it's like Terence said the other day the ones that that are the you know kind of the pillars of the the church brother colen brother de some some of you lot a lot of you all of us people look up to people that's just the way things are you know you look up to leaders and and you know I just like I said today I just don't want to confuse people I don't want to act one way and then be another or you know I just want to be myself and I'm you know I'm plain spoken and God didn't take that out of me but I try not to do it so much to be so dogmatic about it anymore but uh God's still working on all of us I like that little song He's still working on me the Creator God that created this whole universe everything that all the space and all the time but yet he decided to come down and give you eternal life and say you are my child and you can live with me for an eternity and here's the plan to do it with that's right yes you know brother Gary that don't make us allong cry y just go somewhere and just weep he didn't have to he self-sufficient Eternal God that means he doesn't need something to survive but he decided that you and I we're going to survive with him for an eternity yes and not that he's this great r but he is but he's our brother the Bible says amen but he's our King amen and reigns forever more I love that song I wish we sing it but let's let's bow our head and close dear heavly father thank you Lord for today I'm sorry to Ramble On Lord I love to talk about you and what you've done into my life Lord is a miracle but Lord truly that seventh seal that last battle is in the mind it's up there to the in the head part but Lord as you came to Earth and the devil tried to destroy you you kept saying it is written it is written and Lord may we too do the same thing that when Satan comes it we say Satan is written right there in Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation yes for them which are in Christ Jesus yes and Lord he knows who's bluffing and who's not but Lord there's a group of people that you've equi you've given them the right armor you've given them the right battle gear and you've told us where to go find it at now Lord is today we go forth may we
