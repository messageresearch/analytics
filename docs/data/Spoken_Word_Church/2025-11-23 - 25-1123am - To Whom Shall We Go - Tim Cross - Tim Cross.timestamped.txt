[0:00] Yeah. Amen.
[0:00] &gt;&gt; Is that the way you feel this morning?
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing coming to the house of the
[0:05] Lord
[0:06] &gt;&gt; for renewing in life and joy and peace.
[0:08] And I always pray sometimes I struggle a
[0:13] lot and I have to get things right with
[0:16] the Lord and ask him to return unto me
[0:18] the joy of thy salvation. That's one of
[0:20] my lines that I love to use from the
[0:22] scripture that he's given us to make it
[0:25] through this life. That's our sword that
[0:27] we use against the one that takes away
[0:29] our joy. And usually it's us that give
[0:32] him the arrows to take it away.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; So I'm just thankful to be here today.
[0:37] And it's good to see all these smiling
[0:39] faces, these beautiful smiling faces. If
[0:41] y'all seen what I seen, you'd love it.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; I do. Anyway, let's uh we're going to be
[0:47] reading from Deuteromy
[0:50] 33-16
[0:52] today. And uh before we go to the
[0:55] author, let's just give him thanks.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, we thank you
[1:00] for this day you've given us to come and
[1:01] gather around your word. What a
[1:03] beautiful day it is. A beautiful fall
[1:04] day. And father, as the little brother
[1:06] brought this morning about the rest,
[1:08] what a rest, Lord. Oh, what a rest we're
[1:10] looking for in this life, in this word,
[1:13] Lord. That if you can just get this word
[1:15] in us that we can we can manifest it
[1:17] like we should, Lord, and this bride can
[1:20] come to our fruition as she's supposed
[1:21] to come to, Lord, all these things will
[1:24] be done. But, Father, in your time and
[1:26] you're in charge, and we must be patient
[1:28] and take your word a little, here a
[1:30] little, there a little, as your prophet
[1:32] said. We ask now, Father, that you'd
[1:34] bless all those that couldn't make it
[1:36] through the door. whatever their
[1:37] hindrance is, just bless them and be
[1:38] with them. And father, thank you for the
[1:40] wonderful conversation I had with
[1:41] brother Collie this morning. It was so
[1:43] beautiful and so timely, Lord, that he
[1:45] called me and talked to me this morning
[1:47] all the way to church. He misses us. And
[1:49] Father, we he's here with us.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; He and brother Dy and all the other ones
[1:53] that can't be here, Lord, just bless
[1:55] them and be with us. And Father, we ask
[1:57] now that you bless the reading of the
[1:59] word here today and bless all our
[2:01] children that's out in the world there,
[2:02] Father. Just be with each one of them.
[2:05] Thank you for the things you've given us
[2:06] in our lives, Lord, that we don't have
[2:08] any problems. All we got to do is trust
[2:10] in you. You'll just give us all we need.
[2:12] We know that, Father. So, let us reach
[2:14] out, Father, with open hands and take
[2:16] your word, Lord. We ask these things in
[2:19] your precious name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:24] Let's see.
[2:31] Okay, here we go.
[2:35] They got it fixed. That's good.

[2:46] Then that the Lord thy God will turn thy
[2:50] captivity and have compassion upon thee,
[2:52] and will return and gather thee from all
[2:55] the nations, whether the Lord thy God
[2:58] has scattered thee.
[3:01] From
[3:05] the Lord thy God,
[3:08] and then he fetch thee.
[3:11] And the Lord thy God will bring thee
[3:13] unto the land which thy fathers
[3:15] possessed,
[3:16] and thou shalt possess it, and he will
[3:19] do thee good, and multiply thee above
[3:21] thy fathers. Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God,
[3:29] to love the thy God, with all thy heart
[3:32] and with all thy soul that thou mayest
[3:35] live.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; And the Lord thy God will put all these
[3:39] curses upon thine enemies and on them
[3:42] that hate thee, which persecute thee,
[3:46] &gt;&gt; thou shalt return the voice of the Lord,
[3:49] and do all his commandments.
[3:54] And the Lord thy God will make thee
[3:56] plenteous in every work of thy hand, in
[3:59] every fruit of thy body, in the fruit of
[4:01] thy cattle, in the fruit of thy land for
[4:04] good. For the Lord will again rejoice
[4:07] over thee for good, as he rejoiced over
[4:10] thy fathers.
[4:13] unord.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; For this commandment which I command
[4:29] thee this day, it is not hidden from
[4:31] thee, neither is it far off.
[4:39] us and bring it unto us that we may hear
[4:43] it and do it.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Neither is it beyond the sea that thou
[4:48] shalt say, Who shall go over the sea for
[4:51] us and bring it to us that we may hear
[4:55] it and do it?
[4:57] word
[5:00] in thy mouth and thy heart thou mayest
[5:03] do it.

[5:08] life and good, and death and evil.

[5:14] Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to
[5:18] keep his commandments, and his statutes,
[5:21] and his judgments, that thou mayest live
[5:24] and multiply, and the Lord thy God shall
[5:27] bless thee in the land whether thou
[5:29] goest to possess it. Amen. And amen. You
[5:33] may be seated. Thank you for the reading
[5:35] of the word.

[11:39] now. And anytime he gets around
[11:41] believers, even around the family, his

[11:48] generation, they didn't cry. They didn't
[11:50] tell you they love you. You just saw it.
[11:53] But he cries all the time. You get

[12:05] the sun is going down for him, you know,
[12:08] and he's seeing and it's just all about
[12:09] love. You just feel that from him. He
[12:11] may not always say the the nicest
[12:13] things, but it's a deepness in him, you
[12:17] know, because he knows, you know, and um
[12:20] you know, one day if time terror is we
[12:22] all going to face this, you know, but in
[12:25] him, in that presence, a place that you
[12:27] can go to when life is rough, when life
[12:29] is hard, when life is difficult, get
[12:32] into that presence. It's just soothe.

[16:11] dad used to add this verse. He said, "I
[16:16] seen a little boy
[16:19] and he was so
[16:22] afraid
[16:24] cuz the sun
[16:27] it was going
[16:30] down."
[16:33] He said, "Let me tell you of a city
[16:39] over yonder
[16:41] is a place
[16:43] where the sun
[16:46] it would never go down." Amen. Let's
[16:50] worship him this morning. Oh, the sun
[16:55] it would never
[16:57] go down
[17:00] in that sea.
[17:02] The sun
[17:04] it would never
[17:07] go down
[17:11] the flower. Oh, this is not imaginary,
[17:14] my brothers and sisters. It's the truth.
[17:21] And the sun
[17:23] it would never
[17:26] go. And I feel like shouting sometimes.
[17:31] I feel
[17:33] like shouting
[17:35] sometimes.

[17:40] I feel. Yes. Shout them. Thank you, Lord
[17:43] Jesus.
[17:45] I do.

[18:19] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[18:29] This is just like a little baby song.
[18:32] But I know like through all our little
[18:34] trials and tribulations that we go
[18:35] through, little hurts God the Lord
[18:37] allows.
[18:39] Like he spoke to my heart this morning.
[18:40] I wasn't planning on singing. I don't
[18:41] really know if I have a voice. Me and um
[18:43] John have been running a lot a whole lot
[18:45] lately. I feel like really physically
[18:48] and mentally exhausted in some kind of
[18:49] ways. Like I really do. But God knows.
[18:52] But in my heart as we're pulling up to
[18:54] the church, you know this is a baby song
[18:56] y'all. is Jesus loves me. It's like he
[18:59] just told me like Jesus loves me.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead. You know I mean it don't
[19:03] have to be something grand or something
[19:04] fancy but he just told me that he loves
[19:07] me and I'm unworthy but he loves me. You
[19:10] know I fail him every day. Have bad
[19:12] thoughts, doubts, questions all the time
[19:15] but he still loves me.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; It's one of the saints for him.
[19:22] Jesus
[19:24] loves me.
[19:27] This I know
[19:30] for the Bible
[19:34] tells me so.
[19:38] Little
[19:40] ones.
[19:41] To him belong.
[19:46] They are weak.
[19:49] But he is strong.
[19:54] Yes.

[20:35] heaven's
[20:36] gates
[20:38] to open wide.
[20:44] He will wash
[20:47] away my sins.
[20:51] Let this
[20:55] child come in.

[21:02] Jesus
[21:04] loves me. Thank you, Jesus.

[21:41] Though I'm there
[21:44] rew weak and ill
[21:49] on the cross.
[21:52] He died for me
[21:56] and I will love
[22:00] and live for thee.
[22:04] Yes,

[30:14] city in Alaska that the sun
[30:17] &gt;&gt; the sun went down today
[30:19] &gt;&gt; and will not come up until after January
[30:22] the 20some.

[31:16] for our walk
[31:19] in this world.
[31:21] They resound
[31:23] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[31:28] of God impart.
[31:31] Words of life.
[31:34] Words of hope. It gives us strength and
[31:38] helps us cope.
[31:41] In this world, wherever we roll, the
[31:46] word of God guide us home. Sing it to
[31:50] him. Word of God
[31:53] ever true,
[31:55] changing me and changing you.
[32:00] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[32:05] the word of God impart
[32:09] holy words
[32:12] of our faith.
[32:21] and sacrifice

[32:29] word
[32:48] of God.
[32:52] Change me.
[32:57] We have
[33:00] open hearts.
[33:02] Let the world come in.
[33:08] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:13] Amen. We have come with open hearts. Let
[33:16] the word of God impart. Amen. and God
[33:18] bless you this morning and greet you in
[33:20] the name of the Lord. You can be seated
[33:22] if you'd like and just say it's a
[33:24] privilege to be with you again and uh to
[33:27] see you still gathering and pressing the
[33:30] battle fighting the good fight of faith
[33:32] and looking for the coming of the Lord.
[33:34] And uh we are just honored to be with
[33:37] you today and bring you greetings from
[33:39] my wife and family in the ble
[33:43] just a little north of the border there.
[33:45] And uh we're also amen gathering uh
[33:49] encouraged and revived as we look for
[33:52] the coming of the Lord. Amen. So,
[33:55] Brother Wade, I think had expected to be
[33:58] away this morning deer hunting and
[34:00] getting a little break and called me
[34:02] yesterday and told me he was heading on
[34:03] back. Got rained on for three days and
[34:06] said it'd be better to hear me preach
[34:07] than have to sit in a treeand and be
[34:09] rained on. So, Amen. So, uh, we
[34:13] appreciate what I see the Lord doing
[34:16] here in this body of believers. And I
[34:18] know God has called his servant, Brother
[34:21] Samuel Holm. But God had another vessel
[34:24] waiting and ready for God to work
[34:26] through and minister to your needs. And
[34:28] so, uh, we're just here this morning to
[34:30] put our shoulder to the wheel with that.
[34:32] And, uh, trust the Lord can use us in
[34:34] some way to be a blessing to you. So,
[34:36] I'm going to step over to the piano and
[34:38] maybe we just uh play a special or sing
[34:40] and let's just worship the Lord
[34:42] together.
[34:53] that you know I was coming over uh from
[34:56] the hotel this morning. I got up to my
[34:59] turn and there was a big long train
[35:01] blocking the way and uh
[35:04] I went on down and it dead ended. So I
[35:07] made a 180 and came back up and traveled
[35:10] on past and uh thank the Lord I passed a
[35:12] white Suburban with a sister driving
[35:15] that I recognized and I said, "You know
[35:17] what? I believe I can follow her from
[35:19] here and uh and and get to the other
[35:22] side of the tracks. Amen. So, thank God
[35:26] there's a there's believers that know
[35:27] the way.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; And uh you don't have to know the way.
[35:30] If you know who does, you can just
[35:32] follow them.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Uh but um I pray the Lord will bless you
[35:37] this morning. See if I can sing a little
[35:39] song that's on my heart. I make no
[35:40] claims on being a singer, but uh we're
[35:43] all worshippers. Amen. So just worship
[35:46] the Lord from your heart.
[35:49] Be in the key of Fat.
[36:11] Empty
[36:18] and broken,
[36:21] I came back to him.
[36:26] A vessel
[36:29] unworthy
[36:32] and so scarred by sin.
[36:37] But he did not
[36:40] despair.
[36:42] He started over
[36:45] again.
[36:48] And I
[36:50] bless the day.
[36:52] He didn't throw
[36:55] the clay away.
[37:01] Over
[37:04] and over
[37:06] he molds me and makes me
[37:12] into
[37:14] his likeness.
[37:17] He fashions
[37:19] the clay
[37:25] a vessel
[37:27] of honor.
[37:30] I am today.
[37:35] All because he
[37:40] didn't throw the clay away.
[37:49] He is the potter
[37:53] and I am the clay.
[37:59] Holded
[38:01] in his image.
[38:03] That's how he wants me
[38:06] to stay.
[38:08] When I stumble,
[38:11] when I fall,
[38:14] when my vessel
[38:17] breaks,
[38:19] he just picks
[38:21] up those pieces.
[38:24] He doesn't throw the clay away.
[38:30] Aren't you thankful?
[38:33] Over
[38:35] and over,
[38:37] he molds me
[38:40] and makes me
[38:43] into
[38:45] his likeness.
[38:48] He fashions
[38:50] the clay.
[38:55] Oh vessel
[38:58] of honor
[39:00] I am today.
[39:06] All because he
[39:10] doesn't throw the crap away.
[39:18] A vessel
[39:20] of I
[39:24] am today.
[39:28] All because Jesus
[39:33] doesn't throw the
[39:51] Amen. I know that is true. Amen. I'm not
[39:55] just singing a song someone else wrote.
[39:57] I know that to be the truth this
[39:59] morning. Amen. If you'd like to stand
[40:01] with me, I invite you to turn in your
[40:03] Bibles to St. John chapter 6. I'm going
[40:07] to read um two verses or three verses of
[40:09] scripture here. Then we'll um ask the
[40:12] Lord's will will uh will you can be
[40:15] seated. Before we read these verses, um
[40:20] let's just go to him once more in
[40:21] prayer.
[40:23] You know, you may think that you're just
[40:26] here this morning,
[40:28] but it's more than that.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Every time we gather, he promised to be
[40:34] here.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And I could think I'm just here this
[40:37] morning, but it's more than that. He's
[40:39] here
[40:40] &gt;&gt; and he can speak to your heart, your
[40:43] life, your need, your situation and he
[40:46] can take me completely off of anything I
[40:48] might have prepared to say to tell you
[40:50] exactly what you need to hear and to
[40:54] today could be the turning point and I
[40:56] believe it will be the turning point in
[40:58] your life for him to reveal to you his
[41:02] how great and how much his abilities
[41:05] surpass our inabilities. Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, we thank you that
[41:11] you have given us the privilege to
[41:13] gather again this morning, Lord, and to
[41:16] enter into the divine promise where you
[41:19] agreed that to meet with us. And we are
[41:23] inviting you now, Lord. And we believe
[41:25] that the songs have been sung, the
[41:27] prayers have been offered, and all of
[41:30] the preparation, the effort has been put
[41:32] forth, Lord, to make what will now take
[41:35] place possible. But we also realize Lord
[41:38] our inability
[41:40] Lord as a minister, as a speaker, as a
[41:43] person Lord I I could not know what is
[41:46] needed or even how to speak to that
[41:49] Lord. But I surrender my vessel to you
[41:53] in full assurance, Lord, that you know
[41:56] and that you are present, Lord, to take
[41:58] your word and minister it to our hearts
[42:01] and meet the needs that are in our lives
[42:03] today and the needs that we'll
[42:06] encounter, Lord, as we move along and
[42:09] progress in our Christian journey. And
[42:11] we're asking you, Lord, to now come and
[42:14] meet with us. reveal yourself in such a
[42:16] way that it would dissolve all doubt,
[42:18] would dismiss all unbelief and it would
[42:21] change our lives Lord as you desire to
[42:23] change us. In Jesus Christ's name we
[42:26] pray and ask it. Amen. Amen. St. John
[42:29] chapter 6, let's begin reading at verse
[42:31] number 67. Then said Jesus unto the 12,
[42:37] will ye also go away?
[42:40] And Simon Peter answered him,"Lord,
[42:44] to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words
[42:48] of eternal life, and we believe and are
[42:51] sure that thou art that Christ, the son
[42:56] of the living God." May the Lord bless
[42:59] the reading of his word. And you can be
[43:00] seated. I will uh invite you to hold
[43:05] your place there in the scriptures
[43:08] because we want to look back at some of
[43:10] the earlier verses leading up to this uh
[43:13] to establish the context of this
[43:16] scripture.
[43:17] But this question that Peter asked and I
[43:21] was thinking this morning
[43:23] um in looking at the way the gospels and
[43:26] the way the New Testament
[43:29] uh paints us a picture of this character
[43:31] of Peter, he seems like he was a he was
[43:34] kind of an outspoken person. uh like he
[43:37] was very responsive and very reactive
[43:40] and be maybe like myself sometimes
[43:43] before really thinking about it. He
[43:45] would just say what was the first thing
[43:47] that came to his mind. But and so I I
[43:50] thought I wonder how many things Peter
[43:52] said that never got captured in the
[43:54] scriptures. We'll just never know unless
[43:56] the Lord would reveal it. But even
[43:58] though Peter seemed to say things that
[44:01] would embarrass him or embarrass the
[44:03] Lord Jesus, things that Jesus had to
[44:05] correct, they were still
[44:08] worthy of being placed in God's word
[44:13] &gt;&gt; because I believed the Lord knew we
[44:16] would have the same questions. We would
[44:18] have the same tendencies. Whether it
[44:20] would be Peter, Thomas or others we see
[44:23] in the Bible, God let their words go
[44:26] into his Bible
[44:28] &gt;&gt; to be immortalized for our benefit.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; And so I will say this just in the
[44:34] beginning. I don't believe that Peter's
[44:36] question was born out of frustration.
[44:38] Yeah,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; I don't think Peter uh I don't think he
[44:42] said this because he felt it it was just
[44:45] hopeless and that you know he had spent
[44:48] everything he had given everything he
[44:51] although we know Peter had fully
[44:53] invested himself into Jesus' life and
[44:56] ministry. I don't believe it was just a
[44:59] frustrated question. Lord, to whom shall
[45:02] we go like that, but I believe it was as
[45:05] much of a statement
[45:07] as it was a question.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; It was a sincere question, but it was
[45:12] also a statement, which is different
[45:15] than a question. And so uh it it
[45:18] immortalized Peter really as a true
[45:21] disciple that would not meet with the
[45:25] same fate as others who were still in
[45:30] that group of 12. There was at least one
[45:33] there who would go all the way to the
[45:37] communion service before he actually
[45:41] defected or before it became evident and
[45:44] apparent that he although he was called
[45:47] of God and given a part in Jesus
[45:50] ministry he was not a true disciple in
[45:54] the same way that Peter and the 11
[45:58] others were.
[46:00] All right. So, uh, you're very quiet
[46:02] this morning. And, uh, I I really, in
[46:06] preparing this morning, I thought, Lord,
[46:08] why this message and why this thought?
[46:10] And I know that you have a good pastor
[46:13] who is a good teacher. And maybe it
[46:15] would seem like I'm in a mode of
[46:17] teaching this morning or sharing from
[46:19] the scriptures, but I I just believe
[46:22] that if if a a minister can be
[46:24] surrendered, God can use him however he
[46:28] wishes. And I also believe that if
[46:30] there's a need here, if if you need
[46:32] teaching, God can teach. If you need
[46:34] evangelism, God can evangelize. Whatever
[46:37] your need is, God can use a yielded
[46:39] vessel in that way to meet that need
[46:42] even in the next uh 60 or so minutes.
[46:45] So, um God just has a way of doing that.
[46:48] So, I would like to back up here to get
[46:51] the context. Let's move uh into verse
[46:54] number 57 of of John, St. John chapter 6
[46:58] and let's catch what's happening here.
[47:01] Jesus is speaking to the du the Jews who
[47:04] are having a difficult time
[47:06] understanding what he's been telling
[47:08] them.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And we're just going to break in at
[47:10] verse 57. And he says, "As the living
[47:12] father hath sent me and I live by the
[47:16] father, so he that eateth me even he
[47:20] shall live by me." Right?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus is showing them I
[47:26] am only here and the only uh the only
[47:30] thing that enables what you're seeing
[47:32] displayed is the life of God.
[47:36] Uh my life is an expression of God's
[47:40] desire to reveal his life.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; All right? And he says uh but he but
[47:46] he's not just keeping that in himself.
[47:49] He's saying if you're going to live
[47:52] as I live by his life, you are going to
[47:56] live by the life that I give to you.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; All right? Which is a um it it's a I
[48:04] don't want to say it, it's adding to or
[48:06] it's it's elaborating, if you will, it's
[48:08] an escalation
[48:10] of what was shown in the Old Testament
[48:13] through natural types. All right. Israel
[48:15] was called out of Egypt. They were uh
[48:18] people that were slaves. They were
[48:20] almost in a subhuman category. Uh they
[48:23] weren't entitled to anything. They were
[48:25] they were servants of Pharaoh and the
[48:27] and the nation of Egypt. But God called
[48:30] those people out of Egypt. And and God
[48:33] was sustaining them along the journey
[48:35] with everything they had need of. He was
[48:37] revealing himself to them as Jehovah
[48:39] Gyra. Whatever their needs were, he was
[48:43] revealing himself as the source or as a
[48:46] supply. So if they needed the waters of
[48:48] the Red Sea to open, the waters of the
[48:50] Red Sea opened. If they needed mana from
[48:52] heaven, mana from heaven. If they needed
[48:54] water from the rock, water the the rock
[48:56] opened and water came out. So God was
[48:59] God was showing his relationship, amen,
[49:02] to humanity, amen, to a people, amen,
[49:05] that were just nothing to the world. But
[49:07] they were because God had made a promise
[49:10] to Abraham that he was going to do this
[49:12] to his seed. Israel was experiencing
[49:15] that now in this journey. So Jesus is
[49:18] showing them uh that he on another level
[49:21] is the fulfillment of what that was
[49:24] typing using very natural people,
[49:27] natural obstacles, natural challenges.
[49:30] Uh it was spiritual too but it was
[49:32] expressing itself in a very natural way.
[49:35] And so as he had given Israel life, then
[49:38] naturally he's showing, amen, that the
[49:41] very life he lived would become the life
[49:44] of the convert. Amen. The the New
[49:46] Testament believer, the sons and
[49:48] daughters of God, we're going to live by
[49:51] his life the same as he lived by the
[49:53] life of God.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; This is we're in verse 58. This is that
[49:59] bread which came down from heaven.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[50:06] dead.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; So saying this is different.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; This is on another level. It's greater.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; They ate it. They died.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Friends, not just Israelites ate it.
[50:16] Janice and Jambers ate it. Cor and
[50:19] Dayathan ate it. I mean, there was all
[50:21] kinds of people who parttook of the
[50:23] supernatural,
[50:24] but never had the faith to go all the
[50:28] way into Canaan and to enjoy the benefit
[50:32] of why God sent a prophet. They died in
[50:35] their unbelief. They perished. They
[50:36] circled the mountain. They were called
[50:38] up. You know, I I I think this and I I
[50:40] say this, you know, we're living in an
[50:42] hour when it seems like there's more
[50:44] defection or more apostasy than there's
[50:46] ever been in our own ranks. But don't
[50:48] forget Joshua and Caleb prevailed. The
[50:52] 1,999,998
[50:56] other believers.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Fell away.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Joshua, it never deterred or discouraged
[51:05] Joshua or Caleb in the least.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; They were overcomers and they were going
[51:11] to overcome. It didn't matter how many
[51:13] fell away. Didn't matter what took place
[51:15] in that interim between Egypt and
[51:18] Canaan, Joshua and Caleb were going to
[51:20] prevail. Amen. And they saw a whole new
[51:23] generation of overcomers rise up and
[51:26] they encourage their faith. Amen. So
[51:28] that's what we are today as true
[51:31] believers of God. You know, u all that
[51:34] happens, it saddens us. It it should
[51:37] never bring us any joy or or
[51:39] satisfaction to see people falling away.
[51:42] But it's not going to change what God
[51:45] has deposited in our hearts, in our
[51:47] lives. Amen. All we have ever seen in
[51:50] the truth that God has revealed is who
[51:53] we are.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Is where we belong. And that's not in
[51:57] Egypt. And that's not somewhere in
[51:58] between. That's fully occupying every
[52:01] part of God's promise for our lives. And
[52:04] you will not stop short of that. You
[52:08] cannot stop short of that because
[52:10] something is drawing you. There's a
[52:12] power greater than you that's pulling
[52:14] you to be the fulfillment or the
[52:16] vindication of God's word for this hour.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he say, "Not as your fathers
[52:22] didn't eat man and are dead. He that
[52:24] eateth of this bread shall live
[52:26] forever." And these things said he in
[52:29] the synagogue as he taught in Capernium.
[52:32] Many therefore of his disciples when
[52:35] they had heard this said this is an hard
[52:38] thing.
[52:40] Who can hear it?
[52:42] Who can hear it? That's quite a
[52:43] question.
[52:45] Who can hear it? Who can really
[52:47] comprehend
[52:49] &gt;&gt; what he's now saying? And Jesus had said
[52:52] hard things before. Jesus had said
[52:54] things that didn't make sense and and
[52:56] there had already been a falling away.
[52:58] But now here closer in, you know, this
[53:00] wasn't just the the riffraff.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; This was closer to that inner circle.
[53:05] Who can hear it? Now the Bible says, "He
[53:08] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[53:10] spirit saith unto the churches."
[53:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Benham talks about and he
[53:15] says, you know, there's a prophetic
[53:17] class of people.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; It really differentiates the true
[53:21] overcomer from just anybody. Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; You've got a tuned hearing or you've got
[53:27] an ability to hear something that goes
[53:29] beyond the vessel,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; the person or the personality or even
[53:34] the ministry itself. As far, you know,
[53:37] uh, and here I go. I'm getting off
[53:39] track, but but that's okay. I I saw
[53:41] there was a brother that um printed some
[53:44] of the news articles. You you y'all are
[53:46] familiar with when the pillar of fire
[53:48] appeared uh over brotherham's head in
[53:51] Houston, Texas. That was a debate that
[53:53] had been organized and brother Bosworth
[53:56] and a man named Dr. Best were going to
[53:59] debate the scriptures and debate divine
[54:01] healing because the Baptist denomination
[54:04] had closed the door on the prospect or
[54:07] even the idea that divine healing was
[54:09] still ongoing after the last disciple
[54:12] died.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it. They believed it
[54:15] was uh they believed it was
[54:16] superstition. They believed it was
[54:18] mental telepathy. They believed it was
[54:20] something manufactured. They they they
[54:22] didn't believe there was any
[54:24] authenticity to it whatsoever. And this
[54:27] was a prevailing belief amongst
[54:30] denominational believers who believe the
[54:32] Bible, who believed Jesus Christ is God
[54:34] and believed in a new birth and all of
[54:36] these things, but they did not believe
[54:37] in divine healing. So, uh, brother
[54:40] brother, uh, brother Bosworth had agreed
[54:43] to take this man on in a in a debate.
[54:46] And well the debate ended very quickly
[54:49] because he said did the redemptive or
[54:51] did the names the seven redemptive names
[54:54] of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ which
[54:56] of course they did. And so as there was
[54:58] salvation in that atonement there was
[55:01] also healing in that atonement. It's
[55:04] irrefutable and ir uh inseparable. So
[55:07] that ended the debate and then brother
[55:09] Benham comes up there and uh he begins
[55:11] to address the audience and the pillar
[55:13] of fire appeared and the man who had
[55:15] taken what six or seven pictures or so
[55:18] of Dr. uh best shaking his finger in Dr.
[55:21] Bossworth's face. None of those
[55:23] developed,
[55:24] &gt;&gt; but the picture of the pillar of fire
[55:25] did.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; But but what most people, and I didn't
[55:28] know this until I began to read that,
[55:30] uh, you know, this was back in an era
[55:32] when revival made the news.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; This was back in the era when tent
[55:36] meetings and those types of things would
[55:38] come out on the front page of the paper.
[55:39] That's what actually made headlines was
[55:41] the revival. And so in Houston, there
[55:43] were two or three magazines or two or
[55:45] three newspapers that carried on the
[55:48] front page of their of their paper
[55:50] headlines dealing with this uh
[55:52] convention.
[55:54] And I didn't know this. And brother Ben
[55:56] never says one thing about it, but the
[55:58] the controversy was so heated that there
[56:02] was actually a fist fight that broke out
[56:06] between I think it was a Baptist
[56:07] minister and a Pentecostal minister.
[56:09] They were they were they were throwing
[56:10] fists.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, that is
[56:14] representative of the spiritual battle.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; The conflict that was going on. Because
[56:21] while there are preachers up there
[56:22] swinging fists at each other, there's
[56:24] people lying on CS, stretchers, beyond
[56:27] what medicine, beyond what science,
[56:29] beyond what anything man, and even the
[56:32] wisdom God has given the medical world.
[56:35] They were beyond what science or
[56:37] medicine could do for them. lying there
[56:39] in a condition only God could change.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And they're there in that building.
[56:46] They're there in that auditorium while
[56:49] preachers, Amen, religious leaders are
[56:52] fighting it out whether these scriptures
[56:55] even mean what they claim they mean.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And in all of that, God moved. The
[57:01] pillar of fire appeared. God
[57:03] authenticated his prophet. And God
[57:05] wasn't just authenticating a man. God
[57:07] was authenticating his own word and
[57:10] saying, "If you will believe this, if
[57:12] you will accept this, if you will cling
[57:14] to this, if you will focus on this and
[57:16] look to this, you can get up off that
[57:18] cot. You can get off that stretcher. You
[57:21] can be healed. You can be miraculously
[57:23] transformed. Amen. If you can believe
[57:25] this, amen, and you can prevail over
[57:28] whatever unbelief, amen, is around you,
[57:32] you can be changed."
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not even just a
[57:36] possibility. It became a reality. There
[57:39] were people that were healed. There were
[57:41] people that got up off those CS and
[57:42] stretchers. And there were people, amen,
[57:44] who came through healing and salvation
[57:47] because Jesus Christ is the same
[57:50] yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; It was true then and it's true today.
[57:55] But you can see there's a great
[57:56] conflict. Amen. There's a great battle.
[57:59] It's going on even this morning while
[58:01] I'm here preaching this. there's a
[58:02] there's a devil trying to sit on your
[58:04] shoulder and say, "Well, it's all true,
[58:06] but it's not for you, you know, and all
[58:08] this all this is right, but you know,
[58:10] you're you're under this umbrella or
[58:12] this uh cloud of unbelief that is going
[58:14] to try to hold you captive." Amen. Until
[58:17] you can dismiss it long enough to say,
[58:19] "No, I'm going to believe God's word. I
[58:21] know that's true and I know it's for me
[58:23] and I'm going to step into it." Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; This isn't hard saying who can hear it.
[58:30] And when Jesus knew in himself that his
[58:32] disciples murmured at it, he said unto
[58:35] them, "Do this offend you?"
[58:40] And watch, he doesn't say, "I'm sorry.
[58:42] I'll back up." He doesn't say, "Let me
[58:45] let me rephrase this. Let me see if I
[58:48] can let me see if I can uh present it to
[58:52] you in a way that's more palatable
[58:54] or digestible. I I I don't want you to
[58:57] leave.
[58:59] He doesn't do that.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Does this offend you? What and if he
[59:05] shall see the Son of Man ascend up where
[59:08] he was before?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; What if this ministry becomes more
[59:12] mysterious?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus uh I love something. I've heard my
[59:19] father-in-law say this. It's true. God
[59:21] is always on the increase
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and truly God is unchanging but the way
[59:30] he reveals himself is always increasing
[59:34] and escalating.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; So our understanding and our
[59:38] comprehension realization and the
[59:39] revelation that God is imparting to us
[59:41] is always on the increase.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus isn't backing up, but
[59:46] he's saying, "What if you what if you
[59:49] hang around? What if you remain with me
[59:52] &gt;&gt; and see this become even more
[59:56] &gt;&gt; mysterious
[59:57] to the carnal mind
[59:59] &gt;&gt; and to the unbeliever."
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave them every reason they had to
[1:00:05] unbelief.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, I don't believe
[1:00:08] that."
[1:00:11] Well, they came to Jesus and asked him,
[1:00:13] "How long dust thou make us to
[1:00:15] disbelieve?
[1:00:18] They credited him with making them
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; not believe."
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And in fact, they weren't wrong.
[1:00:28] The more he did, the less they believed.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; The more he said, the less they
[1:00:34] believed. He started out with a
[1:00:36] supernatural signs and wonders ministry,
[1:00:38] healing the sick, raising the dead, uh,
[1:00:40] multiplying the loaves and the fishes.
[1:00:42] That attracted a large multitude of
[1:00:44] believers. But then he mo moved into a
[1:00:47] mode that thinned that crowd and sent
[1:00:50] and dispersed many of those who were
[1:00:52] only attracted to the surface of his
[1:00:56] ministry went back to the council, back
[1:00:58] to the temple, back to the synagogue,
[1:01:00] back to their former way of life because
[1:01:02] there was nothing
[1:01:04] deposited on the inside of them to draw
[1:01:07] them into his ministry.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; And friends, that is so today also.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; All right. So, what and if you shall see
[1:01:18] the son of man ascend up where he was
[1:01:20] before verse 63, it is the spirit that
[1:01:23] quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing.
[1:01:28] The words that I speak unto you, they
[1:01:32] are spirit. and they are life.
[1:01:36] Uh I looked this phrase up this morning
[1:01:39] because I wanted to understand better
[1:01:41] what he meant when he said the flesh
[1:01:44] profitth nothing.
[1:01:46] And there's there's a number of ways
[1:01:49] that can be understood.
[1:01:51] Um one is um without the spirit the
[1:01:57] flesh is worthless or or will never
[1:02:00] become anything. And that's true. It
[1:02:03] takes the spirit of God to quicken your
[1:02:06] flesh. Amen. Or otherwise you'll remain
[1:02:08] in your sin.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Uh I also believe that because we are
[1:02:13] born in sin, shaped iniquity, coming
[1:02:15] into the world, speaking lies. There's
[1:02:16] always an element of this flesh that
[1:02:19] we're going to have to contend with.
[1:02:20] We're going to have to keep covered in
[1:02:22] prayer. It's going to have to be atoned
[1:02:24] by the blood of Jesus Christ. And only
[1:02:26] until you are glorified in the rapture.
[1:02:28] Amen. Will that leave you and no longer
[1:02:32] afflict you. Amen. But I I think it I'm
[1:02:35] just going to present this as a
[1:02:37] possibility. I think it also dealt with
[1:02:40] Jesus own ministry.
[1:02:44] As long as he was there in a body of
[1:02:46] flesh,
[1:02:47] that was going in some ways to hinder
[1:02:51] their faith.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Because they were going to attach
[1:02:56] to the man
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; instead of what was greater,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; which was the spirit of God or the word
[1:03:05] of God which made the man possible.
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And to substantiate that, I'll take you
[1:03:11] to the Emmas road.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; After his resurrection, he didn't let
[1:03:16] them actually comprehend who they were
[1:03:18] talking to. He held their eyes. He
[1:03:22] withheld their their actual their five
[1:03:26] senses from recognizing who he was. And
[1:03:29] instead of tell showing them nail scars
[1:03:32] and instead of performing miracles,
[1:03:34] instead of uh giving them some
[1:03:36] inclination or some hint that he was
[1:03:39] that same Jesus, he took them to the
[1:03:41] scriptures.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Don't the scriptures say this? Didn't
[1:03:45] Moses say this? Didn't David say this?
[1:03:47] Don't the Psalms Don't Didn't Isaiah say
[1:03:49] this? He bound their faith to the word.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and the and the Bible said
[1:03:56] their heart,
[1:03:57] Amen. That wasn't their flesh realm.
[1:04:00] That wasn't even their spirit realm
[1:04:01] altogether. Their heart begin to burn
[1:04:03] within them. Their heart, Amen, the that
[1:04:06] the the the inner person, that soul
[1:04:08] realm, Amen, began to be to to be
[1:04:11] ignited by the word. Amen. And they and
[1:04:15] then they recognize the same
[1:04:17] circumstances that made us lose our
[1:04:19] confidence and lose our ability to hold
[1:04:22] on to him as our Lord and Savior and
[1:04:25] King. Amen. The trial, the scourging,
[1:04:28] the mocking, all of those things, all of
[1:04:30] those circumstances, amen, that was
[1:04:32] weakening their confidence in who he was
[1:04:34] was actually the fulfillment of the
[1:04:35] scriptures.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; They weakened Peter.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; They weakened the other disciples. I
[1:04:40] think everyone but John and Mary
[1:04:42] actually fled the Lord Jesus, forsook
[1:04:44] him. Amen. And Peter was one of those.
[1:04:47] But when Jesus arose and instead of
[1:04:50] showing them his body or starting off
[1:04:54] with the the nails and the wounds and
[1:04:56] all of those things that their natural
[1:04:57] eyes could behold, he took them to the
[1:04:59] scriptures and he was proving that their
[1:05:02] faith and confidence would not be
[1:05:04] anchored in a person but in the
[1:05:06] revelation of the word. Amen. and he
[1:05:09] took him and and and brother, they
[1:05:11] weren't going to leave this stranger.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And they were not going to let him leave
[1:05:14] them. When they got into the home, they
[1:05:16] said, "Abide with us." They didn't even
[1:05:19] know who he was, but they knew there was
[1:05:21] something about him that they didn't
[1:05:23] want to let go of. So they said, "Abide
[1:05:25] with us. It's just evening time. Come
[1:05:27] inside." And when the door was closed
[1:05:29] and they sat down at the table, then
[1:05:31] their eyes were open. When he broke the
[1:05:33] bread
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; the way he had done it before, their
[1:05:36] eyes were opened. Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And they knew him.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my friend. Then he had revealed
[1:05:44] himself to them in a way they would
[1:05:46] never deny him again.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then they didn't necessarily need
[1:05:52] him there as a man in flesh.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; At that point, their faith had been
[1:05:58] anchored to something even greater.
[1:06:00] Amen. And that would take them after his
[1:06:03] ascension to the upper room. Amen. where
[1:06:06] his very life would quicken them.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] So he says, so I I believe that's
[1:06:12] captured in that phrase, the flesh
[1:06:14] profitth nothing. The words that I speak
[1:06:18] unto you,
[1:06:20] they are spirit, they are life. Now
[1:06:23] Jesus words aren't that to everybody.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Many hear the word and it does nothing
[1:06:29] for them.
[1:06:31] In many cases, it makes them more
[1:06:34] accountable for their unbelief and it
[1:06:37] brings them under judgment.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; But you've heard me talk about, I know
[1:06:41] I've preached on it maybe twice here,
[1:06:44] um, sympathetic resonance, how things
[1:06:46] begin to ring out upon hearing the sound
[1:06:50] of the note they are tuned to.
[1:06:53] So that shows you there are there's
[1:06:56] something within the predestinated
[1:06:58] believer that when the word is spoken or
[1:07:02] when it's heard by that believer, it
[1:07:05] begins to quicken something on the
[1:07:06] inside of them. Amen. That also begins
[1:07:09] to echo that or begins to sound that
[1:07:12] out.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone used this uh uh recently.
[1:07:17] They were talking about sympathetic
[1:07:18] resonance and they said, you know, if
[1:07:19] those tuning forks, the one is struck
[1:07:22] and the other one begins to sound upon
[1:07:24] just hearing it. It doesn't have to be
[1:07:25] struck. It just hears it. It comes
[1:07:27] within the sound. They said, then the
[1:07:29] first one can be muted
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; and the other one won't stop sounding.
[1:07:36] Amen. It's already amened or been
[1:07:41] quickened by that sounding. So even if
[1:07:43] the even if you take that first one and
[1:07:45] you can do whatever you want to with it,
[1:07:47] the other one's going to keep sounding
[1:07:48] out.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you, they
[1:07:52] are spirit and they are life. But verse
[1:07:56] 64, but there are some of you that
[1:07:58] believe not even in these few remaining.
[1:08:03] You see friends, I I don't like having
[1:08:06] to say this, but in Jesus own life and
[1:08:09] ministry, we see how there was a pairing
[1:08:11] down.
[1:08:13] There was a great multitude initially
[1:08:15] and it kept getting smaller and smaller
[1:08:18] and smaller till it was distilled or
[1:08:21] concentrated
[1:08:22] to only 120.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And then they went into the upper room.
[1:08:30] And then when God descended in the form
[1:08:33] of the Holy Spirit and quickened them to
[1:08:36] the same life that had lived in Christ,
[1:08:38] then the church began to grow.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Then the church began to multiply. Then
[1:08:42] you see the outburst or the that that
[1:08:45] great uh birth of the church there at
[1:08:47] Pentecost.
[1:08:49] There are some of you that believe not.
[1:08:51] Verse 64. For Jesus knew from the
[1:08:53] beginning who they were that believed
[1:08:55] him and who should betray him. And he
[1:08:57] said, "Therefore said I unto you, that
[1:09:01] no man can come to me except it were
[1:09:05] given unto him of my father." That's a
[1:09:08] powerful statement.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; But that is a sobering realization. That
[1:09:14] is a sobering truth that not only Jesus
[1:09:17] recognized, but every one of us has to
[1:09:20] come to that same recognition. And it
[1:09:22] won't make you arrogant, haughty, or
[1:09:25] proud or any of those things. It will
[1:09:26] make you appreciate the only way I could
[1:09:30] have ever actually heard this and
[1:09:31] believed it and been transformed by it
[1:09:33] is God's grace, mercy, and favor shown
[1:09:38] to me. Amen. Uh to allow me to be a part
[1:09:42] of what he is doing. Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Therefore said unto you
[1:09:47] that no man can come unto me." I I I
[1:09:50] feel like I come through here so
[1:09:51] regularly. I I I at the risk of sounding
[1:09:53] like a broken record, but uh I just have
[1:09:56] to be me and I could only preach what
[1:09:59] the Lord has shown me. But it's so
[1:10:01] powerful to me how in Genesis, the Bible
[1:10:04] talks about God laid Adam in a deep
[1:10:05] sleep and he took a part of Adam from
[1:10:08] Adam and formed that part of Adam into
[1:10:12] Mrs. Adam. And the Bible says the Lord
[1:10:14] the the rib that the Lord had taken from
[1:10:16] man formed he into a woman and brought
[1:10:20] her to the man.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; God had to bring
[1:10:25] the feminine expression of Adam back to
[1:10:29] Adam.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying that in St. John
[1:10:34] 665.
[1:10:35] No man can come unto me.
[1:10:39] You can't come back to him unless you
[1:10:43] came from him.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can reach him is
[1:10:48] for God to have formed you from him and
[1:10:52] lead you back to him.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Now, when you get there, you will
[1:10:56] understand why God sent this message.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You will be a message believer because
[1:11:02] God has revealed to you the message. And
[1:11:06] and and friends, now I'm uh now I'm
[1:11:09] winging it, but God does not no true
[1:11:12] message believer is an attachment to
[1:11:14] this message.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; No message, no true message believer is
[1:11:18] someone that heard it said, you know
[1:11:19] what? That is more right than the
[1:11:21] Baptist. That's more right than the
[1:11:22] pent. That's more right than Jehovah's
[1:11:24] Witness. That's more right. You know,
[1:11:25] that makes more sense than anything I've
[1:11:27] ever heard before. I'm going to believe
[1:11:29] that and follow that. Being a true
[1:11:31] message believer is more than that.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:11:34] When you really hear this message,
[1:11:36] you're going to recognize that's who I
[1:11:38] am
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and that's who I've been all along.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And I could never answer. Amen. That's
[1:11:44] why nothing else ever made sense to me
[1:11:46] or produced in my life what this message
[1:11:50] has produced. You are the message and
[1:11:53] the message in you, the message is
[1:11:55] Christ. But Christ is not a singular
[1:11:58] person or being. Amen. He is a family.
[1:12:00] He is a is a groom and a bride. Amen.
[1:12:03] And he has expressed himself in the
[1:12:06] earth as a family of people and those
[1:12:08] children or those attributes of God upon
[1:12:11] hearing the word of God. Amen. Are
[1:12:13] awakened to the realization. Amen. And
[1:12:15] his life begins to form itself within
[1:12:18] you. Amen. And you are drawn into him by
[1:12:22] the power of the Holy Spirit. It is an
[1:12:25] irreversible
[1:12:26] and invincible process.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "All that the
[1:12:33] Father hath given me will come unto me,
[1:12:36] and no man shall put them out of my
[1:12:38] hand." No man, no past, no circumstance,
[1:12:42] no sickness, no condition, no sin, no
[1:12:46] unbelief. There is nothing that can
[1:12:48] separate you from God. If you are a part
[1:12:51] of God, you are going to be restored and
[1:12:54] renewed. Amen. Rejoined to God as an
[1:12:57] expression of his life.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I've got full confidence in
[1:13:02] that. And it's not you doing it. It's
[1:13:04] just you coming subjective to it. It's
[1:13:06] just you saying amen to it. It's just
[1:13:08] you, Amen, becoming transformed by the
[1:13:12] omnipotent power of God in his word. The
[1:13:14] words that I speak unto you.
[1:13:18] I no doubt Jesus could have looked at
[1:13:19] Peter. He could have looked at John. He
[1:13:22] could have looked at Thomas. He could
[1:13:23] have looked at Andrew and said, "The
[1:13:24] words that I speak unto you, they are
[1:13:26] spirit in their life." He probably
[1:13:28] didn't look at Judas when he said that.
[1:13:31] Amen. Unto you.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah. This message unto you is
[1:13:38] spirit and life.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; There are some of you that believe not.
[1:13:44] For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:13:46] they were.
[1:13:48] That believe not.
[1:13:51] That's interesting. I never caught that.
[1:13:54] There was a group that believed not, but
[1:13:57] there was one that would betray him.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Who they were that believed not and who
[1:14:03] should betray him.
[1:14:06] Judas really just manifested to a higher
[1:14:09] degree.
[1:14:12] The result of the unbelief that all
[1:14:15] unbelievers had.
[1:14:17] But
[1:14:19] I don't know how to say this except
[1:14:21] Jesus
[1:14:24] life and and his presence has a very
[1:14:27] polarizing effect.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; You just can't remain neutral.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; When he is present, when his word is
[1:14:35] present, when it's revealed in its
[1:14:37] fullness, you can't stay in the middle.
[1:14:41] You're either going to be pushed away
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; or you're going to be drawn fully
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; into it.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; You just can't you can't remain neutral
[1:14:51] any longer because it is so powerful.
[1:14:53] It's it's like a magnet. It's you're
[1:14:55] either going to go north or you're going
[1:14:56] to go south. You the more power you
[1:14:58] apply to it, the the the quicker it
[1:15:01] drives it. It's just a it's polarizing.
[1:15:03] Now, that was true then and it's true
[1:15:05] today.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And listen to the message uniting time
[1:15:08] inside. Never before had Herod and
[1:15:10] Pilate and the Sadducees and the
[1:15:12] Pharisees and and all these people.
[1:15:14] They'd never joined forces before. But
[1:15:16] now he's here. And they got to do
[1:15:18] something.
[1:15:20] They got to put aside their differences
[1:15:22] and unify
[1:15:24] against the word made flesh.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; So you can't remain neutral. You got to
[1:15:29] either be a fullout unbeliever
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; or a fullout disciple.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And the thing I love is Peter. If you
[1:15:36] look at the life of Peter and you look
[1:15:38] at the life of Judas, you'd have you'd
[1:15:40] be hardressed to tell the difference.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But Peter had something on the inside of
[1:15:44] him that even though he could not
[1:15:46] understand it, he could not even defend
[1:15:48] it. Though he tried, Lord, I'm not going
[1:15:50] to deny you. Peter meant that. When
[1:15:53] Peter said that, he meant that. He was
[1:15:56] the most loyal disciple Jesus had. But
[1:15:58] he didn't have the new birth. So in his
[1:16:01] humanity, in his human desire to be as
[1:16:04] loyal to Christ as he could be, he
[1:16:06] simply did not have the wherewithal. He
[1:16:09] really had nothing more than Judas
[1:16:11] except for something buried down deep on
[1:16:15] the inside that could be quickened once
[1:16:18] the Holy Ghost was released.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And that Judas did not have. But he
[1:16:24] stuck he stuck around long enough, Amen.
[1:16:27] to be so associated with it that he
[1:16:29] could lead the Romans to the Messiah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Now, our job in this hour is not to
[1:16:36] figure out who's who.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Our job is to know who we are,
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And be certain of who we are. Amen. And
[1:16:48] and and and be fully enveloped into
[1:16:50] that. Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:16:53] they were that believe not and who
[1:16:55] should betray him. And he said in verse
[1:16:56] 65, "Therefore said I unto you that no
[1:16:59] man can come unto me, no man can come
[1:17:03] unto me
[1:17:05] except it were given unto him of my
[1:17:08] father." I believe it's the same thing
[1:17:10] he said in Matthew 16. Flesh and blood
[1:17:12] has not revealed this to you, Peter. But
[1:17:15] my father which is in heaven and on this
[1:17:17] rock I'll build my church. The gates of
[1:17:20] hell shall not prevail against it. Now
[1:17:23] we're back to St. John 6 verse 66.
[1:17:29] That's not a coincidence.
[1:17:31] St. John 6 66.
[1:17:34] From that time, many of his disciples
[1:17:40] went back. See, there was somewhere for
[1:17:43] them to go back to,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; But it was not him.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; They had to go back to something. And
[1:17:53] then Peter and the and the 11
[1:17:56] had to be pulled back into him.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Everybody's going back. The question is
[1:18:04] where is back?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Is it back to eternity where you
[1:18:09] originated from
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; or someplace else?
[1:18:14] Then said Jesus unto the twel,
[1:18:19] "Will ye also go away?"
[1:18:23] That's amazing. You can see he wasn't
[1:18:25] worried about numbers. You can see he
[1:18:27] wasn't worried about an attraction. Uh I
[1:18:32] think it was Christmas two years ago,
[1:18:34] Christmas day, my wife and I went to
[1:18:36] Colombia and she told me never to make a
[1:18:38] sermon out of this. So I'm not going to
[1:18:40] make a sermon out of this today. I'm
[1:18:42] just going to use it as a point. All
[1:18:43] right.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; We went past an exit. We needed our our
[1:18:47] daughter was really small at the time
[1:18:49] and and she needed something to drink
[1:18:51] and we knew that uh you know there's
[1:18:52] only a few places open on Christmas day.
[1:18:55] So the first place we went was a
[1:18:56] convenience store and we couldn't find
[1:18:58] those little those special little
[1:18:59] bottles for kids that you know they they
[1:19:01] won't spill it all over the place. We
[1:19:03] couldn't find the juice. So my wife
[1:19:04] said, "Well, there's a McDonald's and
[1:19:06] and they have a chocolate milk for
[1:19:08] kids." So, there was a there was a car
[1:19:11] at the drive-thru kiosk that we figured
[1:19:14] the the dining room was probably closed
[1:19:16] and this was I think even during the
[1:19:18] coming out of CO. So, um but there was a
[1:19:21] car at the drive-thru. So, we're like,
[1:19:22] we'll just drive over there and order to
[1:19:26] go. So, we drove over there and and the
[1:19:28] the car had already moved around and and
[1:19:30] the way the drive-thru was situated once
[1:19:32] you left the kiosk to move around, you
[1:19:35] couldn't see the car that was in front
[1:19:37] of you. So, no one answered me at the
[1:19:41] kiosk. No one said a word. And I So, in
[1:19:44] my mind, I thought, well, if they're
[1:19:46] open, I'll just drive up to the window.
[1:19:49] Maybe the intercom doesn't work. The
[1:19:51] problem is the McDonald's was closed.
[1:19:54] And the sign and they even had a
[1:19:56] calendar. They had printed a paper
[1:19:58] calendar and they'd stuck it on the
[1:19:59] kiosk, but even it didn't make it clear
[1:20:02] that the restaurant was completely
[1:20:04] closed.
[1:20:06] So, the reason people were pulling in
[1:20:08] there and driving up to the kiosk is
[1:20:11] simply because they saw other cars there
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and they thought, "Well, if they're
[1:20:16] getting served,
[1:20:18] maybe I'll get served." And I thought,
[1:20:21] "There's a lot of churches
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; that the only reason anybody goes there
[1:20:26] is because they see some cars in the
[1:20:28] parking lot and they think, well, they
[1:20:31] must be getting served, so maybe I can,
[1:20:33] too.
[1:20:36] And only later do they realize nobody's
[1:20:38] getting anything
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; because God's not there.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; His word's not being preached. There's a
[1:20:47] joke about a cowboy that went to church
[1:20:49] one time and they the deacon board or
[1:20:50] somebody told him said, "If you ever
[1:20:52] come back, don't come back dress like
[1:20:54] that because we don't like people
[1:20:56] dressed like you coming to our church."
[1:20:58] So he went home and he prayed and he
[1:20:59] said, "Lord, how should I dress the next
[1:21:01] time I go?" And Jesus said, "I don't
[1:21:03] know. I've never been there myself.
[1:21:10] I know the pulpit's not a place for
[1:21:11] jokes,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; but friends, you know, Jesus knew that
[1:21:15] his the draw for his ministry would not
[1:21:18] be a crowd.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He knew the thing that would attract
[1:21:21] people to him wasn't the size of the
[1:21:24] following because that will attract
[1:21:26] people.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; There are people who want to be a part
[1:21:28] of the biggest thing. right or wrong,
[1:21:31] whatever it is, it's just big and they
[1:21:33] want to be attached to big.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So they'll they'll even put up with a
[1:21:37] lot of nonsense just to be in the
[1:21:39] biggest group.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; But the draw for the true believer and
[1:21:43] the and Jesus knew his ministry on earth
[1:21:46] was not in vain. He knew the whole
[1:21:48] reason he was sent was to call an
[1:21:51] elected few.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Elijah had to be told the same
[1:21:55] thing. Amen. There's 7,000 I have
[1:21:58] reserved that have not bowed their knee
[1:22:00] to bell. That's who you were sent for.
[1:22:02] Amen. It Moses was really sent to Egypt
[1:22:05] for two people. When you boil it all
[1:22:07] down, he had two converts, but two
[1:22:10] million lives were affected by it, and
[1:22:12] they gave birth to the generation that
[1:22:16] went over with Joshua and Caleb.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, he said, "Will ye also go
[1:22:22] away?"
[1:22:24] Then Simon Peter answered him,"Lord,
[1:22:27] to whom shall we go, "Thou hast the
[1:22:33] words of eternal life, and we believe
[1:22:37] and are sure that thou art the Christ,
[1:22:41] the son of the living God." Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I feel like I've preached my
[1:22:45] sermon, but uh so I don't disappoint the
[1:22:50] people that came here to hear a 60 to 90
[1:22:51] minute message, I'm gonna say a few more
[1:22:54] things. Is that all right?
[1:22:58] I want to know how many of you have ever
[1:23:00] heard the phrase, "Winning isn't
[1:23:02] everything. It's the only thing."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You ever heard that before? Winning
[1:23:08] isn't everything. It's the only thing.
[1:23:11] Now, how many of you know who who
[1:23:15] originated or who authored that
[1:23:17] statement? Does anybody know whose
[1:23:19] statement that is? Now, do you really
[1:23:21] know or are you just pretending to be
[1:23:24] non-sports enthusiast because the
[1:23:26] pastor's looking on because I know
[1:23:28] there's some Bulldogs fans and I know
[1:23:31] I'm in Georgia.
[1:23:33] That quote is attributed to Vince
[1:23:35] Lombardi who was a coach of the Green
[1:23:38] Bay Packers way back when. Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Winning isn't everything.
[1:23:45] It's the only thing. Well, this for
[1:23:48] whatever reason, this was in my mind
[1:23:51] this morning. So, I looked it up because
[1:23:53] Peter has made a phrase. Now,
[1:23:57] to whom shall we go, Lord?
[1:24:00] Thou hast the words of eternal life.
[1:24:02] Those are the immortalized words of
[1:24:05] Peter.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; This phrase I've just shared with you,
[1:24:08] winning isn't everything. It's the only
[1:24:11] thing is a famous quote popularized by
[1:24:15] former Green Bay Packers coach Vince
[1:24:17] Lombardi.
[1:24:19] While often used to emphasize a ruthless
[1:24:24] drive for victory,
[1:24:26] it is a misattribution.
[1:24:30] He later clarified that he meant the
[1:24:33] will to win is the only thing that
[1:24:36] matters, not necessarily the victory
[1:24:41] itself.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Boy, when I read that, I said, man, AI
[1:24:48] is pretty smart.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, I've heard that
[1:24:53] statement. Winning isn't everything.
[1:24:55] It's the only thing. And you think, man,
[1:24:57] that that that that does sound kind of I
[1:24:59] mean, you know, whoever you got to
[1:25:01] stomp, whoever you got to beat up,
[1:25:02] whoever you got to massacre, getting
[1:25:04] that trophy is that's that's the only
[1:25:05] thing. But that's not what he meant.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; He clarified that he meant the will to
[1:25:11] win is the only thing that matters, not
[1:25:15] the victory itself. And then it went on
[1:25:18] to say this. The original quote is
[1:25:21] attributed to UCLA football coach Red
[1:25:25] Sanders.
[1:25:27] It wasn't even Vince Lombardi's.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't invent. He was not the first
[1:25:34] person to say it. He was the person who
[1:25:37] popularized it.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; That's something to think about. He
[1:25:44] didn't originate the statement. He just
[1:25:47] made the statement famous
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; because of his success as a coach.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Now, that's that does tie in with what
[1:25:58] I'm saying this morning.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; This is what differentiated Peter,
[1:26:03] Thomas, John, and the others who
[1:26:06] remained with Jesus despite the
[1:26:10] reproach, the disappointment, or the
[1:26:13] losses they faced. It wasn't about a
[1:26:16] win. It was about the will to win.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; They didn't always win. And on the day
[1:26:23] of the crucifixion, they didn't feel
[1:26:25] like winners. And on the day of the
[1:26:27] resurrection, when he joined with them
[1:26:28] along the road to Omus, they sure didn't
[1:26:30] feel like winners. They were
[1:26:31] discouraged. They were defeated. They
[1:26:33] were despondent. They were cast down.
[1:26:35] Amen. Peter had already gone back to
[1:26:36] fish. And in fact, when Jesus found
[1:26:38] them, he was on the boat naked. Right?
[1:26:40] So, not a lot there to uh to to really
[1:26:43] wow you with Jesus' ability to pick
[1:26:46] disciples or their ability to remain
[1:26:48] loyal to him. Although they were his
[1:26:50] choice and although they amen rose above
[1:26:54] Judas in their loyalty and faithfulness
[1:26:57] to who Jesus Christ is, amen, they
[1:27:00] weren't, it shows us in hindsight, amen,
[1:27:03] they weren't in it for the immediate
[1:27:05] benefit. They were not in it for the
[1:27:07] instant gratification. THEY HAD BEEN
[1:27:10] CALLED BY him because it was in the mind
[1:27:13] of God and it WAS IN THE DESIRE OF God
[1:27:16] for Jesus not to live on the earth as a
[1:27:19] singular expression of who God is. But
[1:27:22] it was to include a body. It was to
[1:27:25] INCLUDE FISHERMEN AND TAX collectors and
[1:27:28] people who were so ignorant and
[1:27:29] unlearned they couldn't even sign their
[1:27:31] own name. It was to include prostitutes,
[1:27:33] ill-famed women. It was to include
[1:27:35] people whose lives were so shameful they
[1:27:38] could not go to THE TEMPLE. BUT GOD
[1:27:41] DESIRED TO REVEAL HIMSELF and include
[1:27:44] those people.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:49] HALLELUJAH. And within them was the will
[1:27:53] to win. Within them was the will. I
[1:27:55] don't want to be a prostitute. I DON'T
[1:27:57] WANT TO BE A DRUG ADDICT. I DON'T WANT
[1:27:59] TO BE THIS for the rest of my life.
[1:28:01] SOMETHING WANTED to be more. BUT THEY
[1:28:03] DIDN'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT
[1:28:06] until they met Jesus.
[1:28:09] Jesus did for them what the temple could
[1:28:12] not do, what the religious order could
[1:28:15] NOT DO, WHAT MOSES and what the writings
[1:28:18] of the Old Testament couldn't do. Jesus
[1:28:20] did it.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; When they met him, their lives were
[1:28:24] changed. She didn't keep on in
[1:28:26] prostitution. They didn't keep on
[1:28:28] fishing and tax collecting. Their lives
[1:28:31] were changed
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; by the manifestation of God's life to
[1:28:36] them. Quicken his life within them.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; This resolve is not born out of human
[1:28:50] desire
[1:28:52] or effort, but is a divine
[1:28:55] characteristic
[1:28:56] that the revelation of his word
[1:28:58] quickens.
[1:29:00] It's his own life
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; that he's quickening by his word and by
[1:29:06] his spirit.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you, they
[1:29:10] are spirit and their life. So, I'm just
[1:29:14] going to read to you a little bit. Jesus
[1:29:16] life and ministry were to express God's
[1:29:18] life in humanity, not to reveal himself
[1:29:22] as the singular expression of God in the
[1:29:24] form of a son, but to open the way for
[1:29:28] sons and daughters to see and recognize
[1:29:31] his life to the extent that his very
[1:29:34] life would quicken them to the same
[1:29:37] expression of fulfilling his word for
[1:29:39] the day and hour it was ordained.
[1:29:42] Regardless of the age, the conditions,
[1:29:44] the prevailing governmental or
[1:29:46] ecumenical powers or spirits of the age,
[1:29:49] his elected and predestinated attributes
[1:29:52] or children would be born into their age
[1:29:56] to hear and fulfill echo or amen that
[1:30:00] word to the extent their lives would be
[1:30:04] his word embodied in humanity.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] Pentecost was the birth of that bride
[1:30:14] body in its infancy. That was the alpha
[1:30:18] expression of Christ's life. But the
[1:30:21] great mystery waiting to be revealed,
[1:30:23] waiting to be revealed at the end of
[1:30:24] time would be that same life expressed
[1:30:28] as an omega. Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; A maturity, a maturity,
[1:30:33] completeness and perfection that by the
[1:30:37] expression of the original life, that
[1:30:39] original life on earth again would bring
[1:30:42] the rest of the body to a resurrection
[1:30:45] and a rapture. I appreciate your amen,
[1:30:48] brother Wade, because that'll show your
[1:30:50] congregation I'm not saying something
[1:30:52] different than what you believe. Amen.
[1:30:56] God was starting there in Christ. And in
[1:31:00] those 11 disciples and in those 120, God
[1:31:03] was starting there a pattern that would
[1:31:05] follow through each age
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; and and escalate and build a body. God
[1:31:10] was actually building a body with his
[1:31:12] word revealed in each age. It was
[1:31:14] calling out the parts and pieces that
[1:31:16] would make up the pyramid, the stature
[1:31:17] of a perfect man. God was building that
[1:31:19] and God is capping that in this age.
[1:31:23] And when it is kept, there are alive and
[1:31:25] remain. There are people that will not
[1:31:28] experience death.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; But the revelation of the rapture, amen,
[1:31:32] will be a reality that transforms their
[1:31:36] bodies. And when they are quickened into
[1:31:39] glorified bodies, the sleeping saints
[1:31:42] will also rise from the graves. Amen.
[1:31:45] And Jesus Christ will come, will descend
[1:31:47] from glory, and we will leave the earth
[1:31:50] to meet him in the air. After a 40-day
[1:31:52] or so gathering here on the earth, amen,
[1:31:56] we're going to see those sleeping saints
[1:31:57] rise. Amen. And we're going to begin
[1:31:59] having fellowship with him. We're going
[1:32:01] to have a reunion with him. There's
[1:32:03] going to be a great rejoicing for about
[1:32:05] 40 days. And then he's going to appear.
[1:32:07] And we're going TO BE TAKEN UP,
[1:32:08] HALLELUJAH, to be with him.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:15] Amen. Man, I feel like a preacher now.
[1:32:19] Ain't God good?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to back up here.
[1:32:23] Paragraph 218.
[1:32:25] Brother Bam says in Christ, the mystery
[1:32:27] of God revealed. It's not expressions of
[1:32:29] some church that we should express
[1:32:32] something. It's a life
[1:32:34] that you don't live yourself, but he
[1:32:37] comes in you and lives by himself and
[1:32:42] you become a prisoner to any to any
[1:32:46] human intellectual being at all. You're
[1:32:49] led by the spirit.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's God's desire. That's
[1:32:54] he's showing us how God's desire to have
[1:32:56] his preeminences.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; See, what God did in Christ was to
[1:33:00] enable
[1:33:02] him regaining the preeminences in his
[1:33:05] church. One leads to the other. One
[1:33:08] makes way for the other. And so when he
[1:33:10] gains the preeminences in his church,
[1:33:12] that takes us back to Eden, that edmic
[1:33:16] condition where there was a complete
[1:33:17] harmony between God and his created son
[1:33:20] and daughter to the extent that they
[1:33:22] were the gods of this earth and all
[1:33:24] nature recognized. Amen. Adam was the
[1:33:27] god of this univer. Amen. the the the
[1:33:31] the the earth that we live on today,
[1:33:33] Adam was its God. Until he failed, the
[1:33:36] earth recognized that and God's desire
[1:33:38] is to restore us back to Eden. And it's
[1:33:42] already underway.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet OF GOD WAS SHOWING US
[1:33:46] the life of God was expressing itself to
[1:33:48] him to the measure that deer, squirrel,
[1:33:51] and storms were recognizing God
[1:33:54] expressed in a man.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; But it didn't stop there.
[1:34:00] God was showing through his messenger
[1:34:02] just as he showed through the second
[1:34:04] Adam, Jesus Christ, what he was going to
[1:34:06] do in the believers of his ministry. He
[1:34:09] was showing, Amen, through another
[1:34:10] adopted son, William Brandham, what he
[1:34:13] was going to do through a bride. I
[1:34:15] believe that with all my heart. Amen.
[1:34:17] And I believe it is happening. I believe
[1:34:20] it IS GOING ON NOW. I don't believe it's
[1:34:21] something off in the future. I believe
[1:34:23] it's taking place right now. Amen. But
[1:34:26] it's so humble, simple. The world will
[1:34:30] miss it.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Most of the world missed it in Christ's
[1:34:33] day, too.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel good this morning,
[1:34:36] brother.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; All right, let me share a few other
[1:34:39] things.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Like I say, I don't want to disappoint
[1:34:41] those people that know I never preach
[1:34:43] less than 90 minutes.
[1:34:47] I like to joke, too. Y'all forgive me,
[1:34:51] but your original pastor was invited me,
[1:34:54] too.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget. I'm I'm I'm really
[1:34:58] stretching it now. But I'll never forget
[1:34:59] I came here as a young preacher one time
[1:35:01] and I demonstrated how that uh your
[1:35:04] attributes are passed to you through the
[1:35:06] human genetics and you can't even help
[1:35:08] it. You're not even conscious of it. You
[1:35:10] walk a certain way, you talk a certain
[1:35:12] way. There are there are reactions and
[1:35:14] responses that are just part of your DNA
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; and you really can't do anything to
[1:35:19] change it. And I was talking about how
[1:35:20] we how crosses, you know, my last name
[1:35:23] is cross and I got four brothers and we
[1:35:25] we we sit in a chair a certain way
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; and and I said we won't sit down, you
[1:35:29] know, just walk up in front of a chair,
[1:35:30] sit down. We kind of glide into it and
[1:35:32] we we kind of we're squatting as we make
[1:35:34] that last tour. And I demonstrated that.
[1:35:36] I'll never forget brother Samuel got up
[1:35:38] and he said, "Now I've heard of a
[1:35:39] crosswalk."
[1:35:42] He said, "But I've never seen a
[1:35:44] crosswalk like that." And so, uh,
[1:35:48] that's, you know, I I don't want to make
[1:35:49] an excuse, you know, but, uh, I humor is
[1:35:53] part of my nature, and I like to I'll
[1:35:55] pick on myself before I pick on anybody
[1:35:57] else. If that makes you feel any better.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:01] Jesus
[1:36:02] was God's love and revelation to let
[1:36:06] know to a predestinated seed that he had
[1:36:10] called you.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; This is him. Hear him. Paragraph 371.
[1:36:15] know the fullness of Godhead is made
[1:36:18] known. The secret of the mystery is now
[1:36:20] revealed that God is manifested. God and
[1:36:24] man become one. The anointed man,
[1:36:26] Christ, what does Christ mean? The
[1:36:28] anointed one. The anointed that was
[1:36:31] anointed with the fullness of the
[1:36:33] Godhead bodily.
[1:36:35] Oh my. How can people doubt it? We're
[1:36:37] once partly Moses had him, partly David
[1:36:40] had him. But oh my, here he is
[1:36:43] manifested in his fullness deity himself
[1:36:47] standing on earth. God in his fullness
[1:36:50] to die for the sin of the people that he
[1:36:52] might bring to his church a sanctified
[1:36:55] life that he might have the preeminence
[1:36:58] in fullness in his church to manifest
[1:37:01] every promise in these last days that he
[1:37:04] promised for the last days. See, listen
[1:37:06] now. and pinch yourself a little. Now
[1:37:08] watch what was Jesus manifested for. Now
[1:37:12] a lot of times I'm going to give you a
[1:37:13] key. A lot of times when brother
[1:37:15] Brandham says pinch yourself, pinch
[1:37:17] yourself, what he's doing is giving a
[1:37:20] signal.
[1:37:21] This is not a 2,000 year ago event.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; This is happening again.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Pinch yourself means come to your
[1:37:30] conscience.
[1:37:32] Quit dreaming and fantasizing about this
[1:37:35] being off in the future or somewhere in
[1:37:37] the past.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Realize
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Samson knocked the pillars down when he
[1:37:42] came to himself.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is bringing us to the
[1:37:47] realization of what God is doing now and
[1:37:50] how it was shadowed and typed then but
[1:37:53] is repeating now.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus manifested for? To show
[1:37:58] God. He was God. He had to be. No man
[1:38:02] could die. No prophet could die. He was
[1:38:04] God. He was the God of the prophets. He
[1:38:08] was the prophets. He was the kings. He
[1:38:10] was the history. See, he's showing how
[1:38:11] all those things shadowed him. He was
[1:38:13] that that was to come, that w that was,
[1:38:15] that is, and he that's to be in this
[1:38:17] day, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:19] forever. He was manifested for that
[1:38:21] purpose. And through that purpose, he
[1:38:24] achieved a church that he the fullness
[1:38:27] of God might bring to pass every promise
[1:38:31] to God in these last days when he gets
[1:38:35] the preeminences in the church. The
[1:38:38] position his place in the church. Jesus
[1:38:41] said, "He that believeth on me, the
[1:38:44] works that I do shall he do also, even
[1:38:47] more than this shall he do, for I go to
[1:38:49] my father." See, that was his purpose.
[1:38:52] Can the purpose of God be defeated?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Then if you're a part of it, how can you
[1:38:56] be defeated?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; That were there was the manifestation.
[1:39:01] And now today, he wants to get somebody
[1:39:04] that can so see it. They can let the
[1:39:07] word Jesus so seen it. It was so
[1:39:10] perfectly born for the day until God
[1:39:12] expressed every move that he made. He
[1:39:15] was God's revelation.
[1:39:18] Oh my. He was God's revelation.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; God revealed. Now he sanctified. I'm I
[1:39:26] am going to close, church. Are you
[1:39:28] listening?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Because this brings you into it.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; He sanctified with his spirit and blood
[1:39:35] a church that he might make every
[1:39:38] promise in this last day be revealed.
[1:39:41] Now see, he could go back and pick up
[1:39:43] what these other fellas left off here in
[1:39:45] the last days and by his Holy Spirit
[1:39:47] reveal all the mystery of the seven
[1:39:51] seals. You see friends, this is not just
[1:39:53] ideas and doctrines and truths. It's
[1:39:55] people. It involves the lives of people
[1:40:00] that have become the embodiment of these
[1:40:02] truths.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; They're living the truth. I've said
[1:40:05] before, God's not going to rapture books
[1:40:07] and tapes. The rapture is going to be
[1:40:10] people who have become the rapture
[1:40:13] because they receive rapturing faith
[1:40:15] through this message.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's his purpose. That's that's why he
[1:40:22] died. That's the second fold of his
[1:40:25] three-fold manifestation. First to
[1:40:27] express himself in Christ, then express
[1:40:29] itself through the church. In the same
[1:40:30] thing, Christ was the word. And the
[1:40:32] church becomes the word when it lets the
[1:40:34] word go through them. But when they
[1:40:36] accept a hybrid denomination, how can
[1:40:38] the word go through? It's grounded,
[1:40:39] causes a short and blows a fuse. But
[1:40:41] when the current is flowy free, flowing
[1:40:43] freely, the word of God, it expresses
[1:40:46] itself. Now, I want you to understand
[1:40:48] this morning. You don't have to
[1:40:50] manufacture this.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; It's not a pressure for you to
[1:40:54] manufacture.
[1:40:57] It's a consignment
[1:41:01] of you saying Lord be it unto me
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; according to thy word.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; It's the simple acceptance
[1:41:10] of his word and say Lord this is your
[1:41:14] word and I am a willing vessel. I am a
[1:41:17] bedding ground. I want your word to have
[1:41:21] its preeminence in whatever way you
[1:41:23] decide. Here I am Lord. Fill me, send
[1:41:27] me.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's what makes this, you know, it's
[1:41:31] not you gota you got to manufacture this
[1:41:34] wool. No, just eat. Eat the word.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; The wool is in your DNA, but you got to
[1:41:39] eat the word to be able to grow wool.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, when the current is flowing
[1:41:46] freely, the word of God, it expresses
[1:41:47] itself. The works that I do shall you
[1:41:49] also, and in the last days it shall come
[1:41:51] to pass. Behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:41:52] prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:41:55] the children back to the faith of the
[1:41:57] fathers. And in there, there would come
[1:41:59] a time come forth when he could express
[1:42:02] himself in fullness of his godhead,
[1:42:05] deity through the church,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; have the preeminences in this church.
[1:42:10] I've got to say this, I do not believe
[1:42:12] that William Brandham alone embodied
[1:42:15] this.
[1:42:18] I refute that on the basis of his own
[1:42:22] statements.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; The problem I have with that idea is
[1:42:25] brother Bradom didn't believe it.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; He did not believe he was the only one.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Elijah thought that one time and God
[1:42:34] said, "No, you're not. I've got 7,000.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to be alive.
[1:42:39] You don't have to know who they are. I
[1:42:41] know who they are."
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] Oh my friend, it's wonderful to see it
[1:42:47] in brother Brenham. BUT DO YOU KNOW who
[1:42:49] you are? Whether other churches, other
[1:42:51] doctrines, other moves, your neighbor,
[1:42:53] YOUR PARENTS, I DON'T CARE WHO, whether
[1:42:55] or not they ever see who you are, if you
[1:42:58] know who you are, God's word can express
[1:43:01] itself through you.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] You are the amen to the message. You
[1:43:10] know, uh Jesus went to the tomb of
[1:43:12] Lazarus one day. He'd been there dead
[1:43:14] for 4 days. The Jews didn't want to have
[1:43:16] anything to do with them cuz even
[1:43:17] getting in proximity to a dead body was
[1:43:19] a violation of the Jewish faith. And
[1:43:22] Jesus says, "Show me the tomb." And they
[1:43:24] led Jesus to the mouth of the tomb and
[1:43:26] he said, "Roll away the stone." And they
[1:43:28] rolled away the stone. And he said,
[1:43:30] "Lazarus, come forth." And out of that
[1:43:33] tomb, a man that had been laying there
[1:43:35] for four days and had begun to decay and
[1:43:38] decompose walked forth from that tomb
[1:43:40] wrapped in grave clothes.
[1:43:42] And you know what? Jesus did not unwrap
[1:43:44] him. He told them, "Loose him."
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; The same words he said to the cult and
[1:43:51] the same words he used in the loosing of
[1:43:53] the earth from the atmospheres that made
[1:43:55] it Satan's Eden. He said, "You've got to
[1:43:57] do this, church." Because you're the one
[1:44:00] who thought he was dead.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; And wrapped him in grave clothes.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Now, friend, that has a great
[1:44:06] application. I'm taking my time and I'm
[1:44:08] off my notes. But there are people that
[1:44:11] God does something in their lives
[1:44:14] that only God can do.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; He speaks to them and calls them out of
[1:44:18] that dead condition and they will never
[1:44:22] be more alive
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; than they are at that moment.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; But they are still wrapped in something
[1:44:28] other people put them in.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And that is the memories
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; of that condition. And we say, "Well,
[1:44:37] he's a drunkard. She's a drug addict.
[1:44:39] She's prostitute. They, you know, you
[1:44:41] don't know their past. Their past don't
[1:44:43] matter."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; He spoke and his word brought them to
[1:44:49] life.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now you unwrap those grave
[1:44:54] clothes.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; You get that off of them and you get
[1:44:58] that idea out of your mind that that's
[1:45:00] who they are. That is not who they are."
[1:45:04] Amen.
[1:45:05] Amen. That's a result of the condition.
[1:45:09] Lazarus did not wrap himself in those
[1:45:11] grave clothes. They wrapped him in the
[1:45:13] grave clothes because to them he was
[1:45:15] dead. But Jesus said, "Loose him because
[1:45:19] he's not dead. I made him alive. Now you
[1:45:22] loose him and let him demonstrate. Let
[1:45:26] him live in the life that I put in him
[1:45:30] by the hearing of my word."
[1:45:33] Somebody say amen. Somebody say thank
[1:45:36] you Lord. I was dead in sin. I was dead.
[1:45:39] I WAS UN UNDONE. I WAS A SINNER. I
[1:45:42] SERVED SATAN. I BUILT PHARAOH'S
[1:45:44] KINGDOMS. I was the least of the least.
[1:45:47] BUT ONE DAY I heard a voice. AND WHEN I
[1:45:50] HEARD THAT VOICE, I COULD NOT LIE STILL.
[1:45:52] I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THAT CONDITION. I
[1:45:55] had to stand up. Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; You imagine how many Sadducees that
[1:45:59] would have loved to keep Lazarus in that
[1:46:01] condition and and and never have a
[1:46:04] reason not to to believe
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; never have a reason to believe in the
[1:46:09] resurrection.
[1:46:11] And they might have taken Lazarus to the
[1:46:13] side later said, "Lazarus,
[1:46:15] you completely demolished
[1:46:18] all that we've built our church and
[1:46:21] faith on.
[1:46:23] We don't believe in a resurrection, but
[1:46:25] now you're alive.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Why in the how in the world?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Lazarus say it's as simple as this.
[1:46:33] I heard my name.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[1:46:38] called my name. And when I heard him say
[1:46:42] my name, I could not.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I COULD NOT remain in that
[1:46:49] condition. BUT I STEPPED FORTH and his
[1:46:53] word unraveled me, removed the obstacle,
[1:46:56] REMOVED THE STONE, AND HERE I AM TODAY
[1:46:59] as an echo or an amen to Jesus life and
[1:47:03] ministry. Lazarus lived on after Jesus
[1:47:07] was taken to be a witness to his life,
[1:47:10] his power, and his resurrection.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:24] In there would come a time when he could
[1:47:26] express himself in fullness of his
[1:47:28] godhead deity through his church.
[1:47:31] Have the preeminences in his church. In
[1:47:34] this church. Oh my. What? The anointed
[1:47:36] man. Now the anointed people. The
[1:47:39] anointed people. Oh my. To bring back
[1:47:42] the anointed bride and the bridegroom.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Anointed by why? accepting what Eve
[1:47:48] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:47:51] the anointed word because he said my
[1:47:53] word is spirit. See anointed with the
[1:47:56] word what Eve turned down he comes back
[1:48:00] and we accept.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; All right I'm closing now. If they want
[1:48:04] to come to the music that'd be fine.
[1:48:07] To whom shall we go Lord?
[1:48:10] That was Peter's question
[1:48:14] and he originally
[1:48:16] authored the phrase.
[1:48:21] Peter was the first one
[1:48:24] that ever said it.
[1:48:28] But my question to you today
[1:48:31] is who will popularize
[1:48:34] the phrase?
[1:48:36] Because just as we saw with the
[1:48:38] statement, winning is it everything,
[1:48:40] it's the only thing, the man most people
[1:48:43] attribute that statement to didn't say
[1:48:46] it the first time. He picked it up from
[1:48:50] a lessernown coach
[1:48:53] and made it his own statement. And even
[1:48:55] though it was mis
[1:48:58] appropriated and mischaracterized,
[1:49:01] it's still the statement for which he is
[1:49:03] known today because of how popular he
[1:49:06] made it.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking today, we know who
[1:49:10] originally said, "To whom shall we go?"
[1:49:12] And it wasn't because he wanted Jesus to
[1:49:15] point him somewhere else.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because he was so discouraged
[1:49:20] and so disheartened and so hopeless and
[1:49:22] so despondent. He was just waiting on
[1:49:24] Jesus to tell him he knew there was
[1:49:27] nothing better.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; In a sense, it was a rhetorical question
[1:49:33] or it was a statement.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And to prove that, listen to what he
[1:49:39] said. Thou hast the words.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; You're the source.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; You got it. If you aren't it, we're
[1:49:47] we're lost. We're nothing. We're toast.
[1:49:51] It's over. But it was a declaration of
[1:49:55] absolute abandonment
[1:49:58] to Christ and him alone.
[1:50:02] It wasn't everything. It was the only
[1:50:05] thing.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, we're being questioned today.
[1:50:12] Whether by the unbelievers, the critics,
[1:50:14] or just
[1:50:16] everyday life,
[1:50:18] we're being questioned. What will my
[1:50:21] response be?
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; I say, let's popularize the phrase.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Peter might have said it originally, but
[1:50:29] let's
[1:50:31] recognizing who Christ is today.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And saying, "Where else would I go?
[1:50:36] Where else would I turn? Who has what he
[1:50:39] has done for me? Who can do for me what
[1:50:42] this message, what this truth, what this
[1:50:45] revealed word has done for me today? You
[1:50:47] came too late to tell me there's
[1:50:49] something else. You came too late to
[1:50:51] tell me this is setting the stage for
[1:50:54] something greater. You come too late to
[1:50:56] tell me the seventh angel was a
[1:50:57] forerunner to an eighth messenger or
[1:50:59] that I need some other pastor or some
[1:51:01] other leader or some other great move of
[1:51:03] God to rise up after this and lead me
[1:51:06] onto something greater. You came too
[1:51:07] late to tell me that.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? This message is the
[1:51:12] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:51:15] me.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; TO ME, IT'S PERSONAL NOW. It's personal
[1:51:19] now. I'm thankful brother Wade sees it.
[1:51:21] I'm thankful you see it. BUT IF NOBODY
[1:51:23] ELSE SEES IT, I'M A JOSHUA AND I'M A
[1:51:26] CALEB. And I will not stop short of a
[1:51:29] full inheritance AND A FULL
[1:51:31] DISPOSSESSION OF everything that stands
[1:51:34] BETWEEN ME AND MY PROMISE. WHERE ELSE am
[1:51:37] I going to go? What else is there? There
[1:51:40] is nothing ELSE LEFT BUT THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:51:43] TO BRING RAPTURING FAITH. It is bringing
[1:51:45] rapturing faith. IT HAS BROUGHT THE
[1:51:47] RAPTURING FAITH. It is the visitation of
[1:51:50] Jesus Christ to the earth today in the
[1:51:52] form of the revealed word to perform the
[1:51:54] promise of the word for this hour.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying amen to it. AMEN. ISAIAH
[1:52:01] MADE THE PHRASE, "BEHOLD, a virgin shall
[1:52:05] conceive." But Mary popularized it.
[1:52:08] Hallelujah. THERE WAS A PROPHET WHO SAID
[1:52:10] IT, BUT THERE WAS A VIRGIN WHO LIVED IT.
[1:52:14] SHE EXPRESSED IT. SHE SAID, "I AM THE
[1:52:17] MANIFESTATION OF THAT SCRIPTURE." Peter
[1:52:20] came out of the upper room AND SAID,
[1:52:21] "THESE MEN are drunk as you suppose."
[1:52:23] But the third hour OF THE DAY, HE SAID
[1:52:25] IT, BUT I'M HERE TO popularize it. I'm
[1:52:28] here to live it. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS IT.
[1:52:30] WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TODAY IS THAT
[1:52:33] FULFILLED.
[1:52:35] What you're seeing today, this is spoken
[1:52:38] word, church. SAMUEL DELL DIDN'T START
[1:52:40] IT AND WADE Dell can't keep it going.
[1:52:43] God spoke it into existence. And God's
[1:52:46] going to pastor it. God's going to
[1:52:48] sustain it. God's going to keep it. And
[1:52:50] he's going to use men like Brother Wade
[1:52:52] and myself. And you,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; you got a part in this church, too.
[1:52:58] Friends, I believe that. I believe God
[1:53:01] ordains everybody to be a part of a
[1:53:04] local assembly.
[1:53:06] And when you know that, you can find
[1:53:08] your place and function in it.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't plan on saying that, but
[1:53:15] when you have a revelation of where you
[1:53:17] fit
[1:53:18] into God's body, and God's body is much
[1:53:21] greater than this portion of his body. I
[1:53:23] realize that. But when you know where
[1:53:26] you belong,
[1:53:27] get in there, get grounded, get
[1:53:31] attached, become cemented together,
[1:53:34] and watch God perform through his
[1:53:38] building.
[1:53:40] Amen. The expression of his life here on
[1:53:43] the earth. Amen. You know, you know what
[1:53:46] Mary did? She filled in the blank.
[1:53:50] There was a blank there. A virgin shall
[1:53:53] conceive.
[1:53:55] Mary simply filled in the blank. My wife
[1:53:59] and I have have adopted a child and
[1:54:02] we'll by the grace of God adopt another
[1:54:04] one maybe within the next year. There's
[1:54:06] all kinds of paperwork and you know this
[1:54:08] from buying a home, buying a car, but
[1:54:11] especially when it comes to legal
[1:54:12] documents.
[1:54:14] There are things that you are required
[1:54:16] to sign
[1:54:18] and it'll talk about, you know, this is
[1:54:20] the state, this is the county, this is
[1:54:22] the federal government, this is this
[1:54:23] this uh governmental power, this entity
[1:54:27] and all of that is on the document, but
[1:54:30] there's a blank space
[1:54:33] and it says your name in the blank.
[1:54:38] And what that blank is giving you is the
[1:54:41] privilege
[1:54:42] of putting yourself
[1:54:45] as a part of the bond
[1:54:48] that is reinforced by everything the
[1:54:51] state is
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; or everything the county is, everything
[1:54:55] the federal government is. They are put
[1:54:58] there on the document,
[1:55:01] typed in, irrevocable, irreovable. They
[1:55:04] are there permanently and it's saying
[1:55:07] you write your name there
[1:55:10] and you are going to become a part of
[1:55:13] this institution
[1:55:15] that can never
[1:55:18] never be disenfranchised,
[1:55:21] never be separated. The state would have
[1:55:24] to go bankrupt and the federal
[1:55:26] government would have to go bankrupt.
[1:55:28] They would have to be completely
[1:55:29] dissolved for you to lose.
[1:55:34] And once you put your name in there in
[1:55:36] ink, they go back and the same person
[1:55:39] that typed up the first one types up
[1:55:41] another one with your name in the same
[1:55:44] type
[1:55:46] that theirs was before you signed it,
[1:55:48] inc. It makes you a permanent
[1:55:52] fixture
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; in that government of that power. Mary
[1:55:57] wrote her name. Actually, the angel of
[1:56:00] the Lord did it, but Mary had to say
[1:56:02] amen to it.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is say amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; That was for me.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; That's for me. That's for my life.
[1:56:12] That's for my condition. That's for my
[1:56:13] marriage. That's for my family. I say
[1:56:15] amen to it. When you write your name in
[1:56:17] the blank, God comes back behind it and
[1:56:19] writes it in there and said, "Dares
[1:56:22] Satan or any other power
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; to challenge it."
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Because when he does, God himself would
[1:56:28] have to go bankrupt before you could
[1:56:30] lose.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word,
[1:56:36] behold the handmade of the Lord. That's
[1:56:39] the life of the word expressing itself
[1:56:42] through you which makes you the ultimate
[1:56:45] vindication of its power. Do you love
[1:56:47] the Lord this morning?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's stand to our feet. Could
[1:56:50] you give me the key of G? I'm going to
[1:56:51] turn it over to a good song leader here
[1:56:53] in just a second, but I want to sing
[1:56:55] this one. They were g in the upper room
[1:56:58] all praying in his name. They were
[1:57:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost when
[1:57:04] powerful service came. Now, what he did
[1:57:08] for them that day, he'll do for you the
[1:57:11] same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:57:14] of them.
[1:57:16] I'm one of them.
[1:57:19] I'm one of them.
[1:57:22] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:57:25] them.
[1:57:27] Oh, one of them.
[1:57:30] I'm one of them.
[1:57:33] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:57:36] them.
[1:57:38] Come my brother, seek this blessing that
[1:57:41] will cleanse your heart from sin. That
[1:57:44] will start the joy of that.
[1:58:01] Turn around, shake somebody's hand, and
[1:58:03] say, "I'm one of them."
[1:58:24] Or boast of a worldly fame. They have
[1:58:27] all received their Pentecost, baptized
[1:58:30] in Jesus' name, and are pouring now with
[1:58:34] Lord and water. Glory gets the same. I'm
[1:58:37] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:58:42] I'm one of them.
[1:58:45] I'm one of them.
[1:58:47] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:58:51] of them. Oh, I'm one of them.
[1:58:56] I'm one of them.
[1:58:58] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:59:02] of them.
[1:59:04] Oh, these people may not learn to meet
[1:59:07] nor boast of a world. It will not
[1:59:10] receive a show in Jesus name and now
[1:59:16] both
[1:59:18] hit the bride. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[1:59:22] one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. Oh,
[1:59:28] I'm one of them.
[1:59:30] Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:59:34] them.
[1:59:36] I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them.
[1:59:41] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:59:44] of them.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; You're one of them.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You know, Judas said he was one of them.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; You got to know what them you're talking
[1:59:56] about.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Judas thought he was right there in with
[2:00:00] them. And he was. He sure did. Uh he
[2:00:04] faked the other 11 out.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; But brother Tim, only one person that
[2:00:09] was the son of man knew who he was. So
[2:00:13] in the end time only the manifestation
[2:00:16] of the son of man is going to know where
[2:00:18] that other party's at.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; We're one of them though.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; We're one of them that the end of earth
[2:00:25] has come upon. We're one of them that's
[2:00:27] going to take a rapture.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; We're one of them that's going to what?
[2:00:33] Benefit from the word of God being
[2:00:36] preached just like our brother Tim
[2:00:38] today. What a wonderful job. Let's give
[2:00:40] him another hand.
[2:00:42] Amen.
[2:00:44] Now that hymn I was talking about God.
[2:00:46] So now let's give brother Tim a hand a
[2:00:48] hand clap that one that him
[2:00:52] because we know God used him and we sure
[2:00:54] appreciate uh
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; appreciate the Lord using him.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And uh and coming being with us today.
[2:01:00] He's just he's part of the family. He's
[2:01:02] just a family member. He is pretty cross
[2:01:04] but he is part of the family. If any of
[2:01:07] you have ever made his other brothers,
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; he's the best of the best. So, so if
[2:01:13] he's a little bit, his brothers are 10
[2:01:16] times worse. So, but we sure appreciate
[2:01:18] brother Tim and uh Sister Faith, we've
[2:01:20] known him for a long time. And and I had
[2:01:22] forgotten that dad had said that, but I
[2:01:24] remember now that uh you talking about
[2:01:26] crosswalk. So, but we you love the Lord.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Then you have to love our brother
[2:01:31] because he brought the word of God to
[2:01:32] each one of us today.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope you got your portion. Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I hope you got your fill.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you got something to
[2:01:40] sustain you until
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; we only got Monday now. Tuesday night
[2:01:44] we'll be back. And uh and then I want
[2:01:47] you all to have a wonderful Thanksgiving
[2:01:48] coming up the end of the week. And uh
[2:01:50] we'll be back regular service on Sunday.
[2:01:53] And um just pray for each and everyone.
[2:01:55] I know there's a lot of traveling goes
[2:01:56] on during that time and um we are going
[2:02:00] to pray that your travel is safe. go see
[2:02:03] friends and family and uh
[2:02:07] but brother Brandham,
[2:02:10] you would think on a Thanksgiving day he
[2:02:13] preached in Streetport, Louisiana.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; The invisible. He said this will make
[2:02:20] you want to cry. This is my message. My
[2:02:23] message. He's the prophet of the end
[2:02:24] time.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; This is my message to you.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. My thanksgiving message to you
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; is that you have united
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; with Christ
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; here.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Not waiting as denomination say, well,
[2:02:39] when we get there. No,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; no. There is here.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; If it's like the old saying is, you got
[2:02:44] to have some heaven here to get to
[2:02:46] heaven there.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a connection. And I
[2:02:48] believe brother Tim, he's connected. As
[2:02:51] brother Ernie Villan Noea always says,
[2:02:53] you got to be plugged into eternal. If
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; you're not plugged into the eternal,
[2:02:56] you're not eternal.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; But we're plugged into the eternal
[2:03:00] eternal word of God.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; We'll never have to leave. There'll be a
[2:03:06] time when we will not have to go. We can
[2:03:08] just praise the Lord for thousands of
[2:03:11] years and not have to worry about
[2:03:14] Monday.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I hope the rapture takes
[2:03:17] place between 6:00 and 9 Monday morning.
[2:03:19] We'll just mess the devil up, won't it?
[2:03:22] because some of us that do still work,
[2:03:23] we have rough Mondays. So, but just pray
[2:03:25] for us all. We had a good time uh being
[2:03:27] gone and rested and uh get back to the
[2:03:31] uh get back in the saddle again. But,
[2:03:33] Brother Aaron's going to be with us
[2:03:34] Tuesday night and speak for us. So, um
[2:03:37] all minds and hearts clear. Thank y'all
[2:03:38] so much. Last weekend, brother Steven
[2:03:40] Wilson did a wonderful job. He called
[2:03:42] and said to thank every one of you for
[2:03:44] your prayers and pulling on the gift he
[2:03:46] had. And we sure appreciate all the food
[2:03:48] that y'all fixed that u your sisters and
[2:03:50] brothers brought. and the um efforts
[2:03:53] that you put together to serve it and
[2:03:55] serve the uh the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:57] And we sure do appreciate that. They're
[2:03:59] the cream of the crop.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; When you're serving the bride, you're
[2:04:03] serving Jesus Christ.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. An extension of himself,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; not another person. An extension of
[2:04:11] himself.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; So all minds clear. Let's bow our heads.
[2:04:14] Dear Lord, thank you for this day. My,
[2:04:16] what a word that we've heard, Lord, that
[2:04:18] we can now, Lord, digest this message,
[2:04:22] Lord, and just chew it up over and over
[2:04:23] again, Lord, as you told John to eat the
[2:04:25] book. But we're still eating it now.
[2:04:28] We're eating the word of God as our
[2:04:30] brother brought to us, Lord. How that
[2:04:32] Lazarus, Lord, he was in that grave for
[2:04:35] 4 days, but when he came out, there had
[2:04:38] to be one more step. He had to be
[2:04:39] unwrapped. Lord, we've come to a place
[2:04:42] now of the unbinding. I believe we've
[2:04:44] resurrected out of this world as far as
[2:04:46] the denominational ideas and things, but
[2:04:48] Lord, there's one more time.
[2:04:51] Lazarus had to die again, but we will
[2:04:53] not. Father, hasten that day, Lord, that
[2:04:56] we come to a place, Lord, of as we come
[2:04:58] to adoption and then we come, Lord, to
[2:05:00] the to the resurrection, Father, and
[2:05:02] then the rapture, Lord, that's what our
[2:05:05] soul is longing for because that's
[2:05:06] what's going to get out of here. It's
[2:05:08] going to get us out of here, Lord, as
[2:05:09] our soul that's connected to you,
[2:05:11] Father, from the foundation of the
[2:05:13] world. Father, forgive us of our faults
[2:05:15] and ideas. Lord, be with us as we travel
[2:05:17] on the highways. Bless the ones that are
[2:05:19] traveling near and far, Lord, to be with
[2:05:21] family this weekend, Lord. Thanksgiving
[2:05:24] day should be every day for a believer,
[2:05:25] Father. But Lord, as we have that one
[2:05:28] day, Lord, that we'll be with our family
[2:05:30] and friends, Lord, and be with Brother
[2:05:32] Aaron as he speaks to, Lord, the family
[2:05:33] members on Tuesday night here, Father.
[2:05:35] Pray that you should be with Brother
[2:05:36] Tim, Lord. give him strength, Lord, as
[2:05:38] he continues back, Lord. Bless his
[2:05:40] family, Lord, as this increasing. I pray
[2:05:42] that you'd bless, Lord. May the process
[2:05:44] go very smooth. And Lord, that all will
[2:05:48] be done for your honor and glory.
[2:05:49] Father, we appreciate his wife, Lord,
[2:05:50] and their family there. We love them
[2:05:53] all. They're just sure enough, they're
[2:05:55] just family, Father, and we all growing
[2:05:56] up together, Father. Now, I pray that we
[2:05:58] grow up in you. You bless each one,
[2:06:00] Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[2:06:03] bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:06:06] All hell
[2:06:09] Jesus.
[2:06:13] All hail Emmanuel,
[2:06:19] King of Kings,
[2:06:22] Lord of Lords,
[2:06:25] bright morning star.
