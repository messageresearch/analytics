[3:20] you guide us now and just have your way
[3:22] with each one of us in Jesus name amen
[3:28] Romans 8.
[3:33] verse 28 and we know that all things
[3:35] work together for good to them that love
[3:37] God to them who are thee called
[3:38] according to his purpose
[3:40] for whom he did for no he also did
[3:42] predestinate to be conformed to the
[3:45] image of his son that he might be the
[3:47] firstborn among many brethren
[3:50] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[3:52] he also called and whom he called him he
[3:55] also justified in whom he justified then
[3:57] he also glorified what shall we then say
[4:01] to these things
[4:02] if God be for us
[4:04] who can be against us and
[4:06] all right Ephesians 1 verse 3.
[4:10] blessed be the God and father of our
[4:12] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[4:13] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[4:15] places
[4:16] according as he had chosen Us in him
[4:19] before the foundation of the world that
[4:22] we should be holy and Without Blame
[4:24] before him in love having predestinated
[4:27] us unto the adoption of children by
[4:29] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[4:33] good pleasure of his will to the play
[4:36] Praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[4:38] he hath made us accepted were in the
[4:43] Beloved you may be seated the Lord that
[4:45] is blessing to the reading of the word
[4:51] now I
[4:53] I know we spent a lot of time on
[4:55] anything and
[4:57] the prophet of God said hold it up until
[4:58] the people see it so then that's you
[5:01] know why I do a lot of things but you
[5:04] know that way you can say at least well
[5:06] we've hatched this whole subject out
[5:08] maybe or something until we've got
[5:10] something out of it but I hope that
[5:12] you're enjoying the
[5:14] part and thoughts of how does God
[5:16] predestinate and we know that he
[5:19] predestinates by his foreknowledge so
[5:22] anything that you're going to deal with
[5:23] predestination
[5:25] you know if you're going to say well I
[5:27] come with this predestinated seed if
[5:30] you're going to say God predestinated me
[5:32] you're going to have to remember that
[5:34] that would be uh
[5:38] to stop at that point of just talking
[5:41] about predestination then you would be
[5:43] cutting yourself short
[5:45] from the point that I'm trying to get us
[5:48] to see and to bring it down to a place
[5:52] of understanding uh the mind of God the
[5:56] things and like I've said many times
[5:58] then if we just if we just go back to
[6:01] where God sat down and talk something
[6:03] out he decided that's where it's going
[6:05] to be well I'm trying to back up more
[6:08] into his mind to see why that things
[6:11] would be done the way the way they're
[6:13] done and good to see brother Howe back
[6:15] there with us you know that he's with us
[6:17] and things and he's going uh this week
[6:20] or the next one to have a pacemaker put
[6:22] in so we my prayers is he won't have to
[6:25] have it I mean I still believe that
[6:27] that's just you know the way I believe
[6:29] it and and I'm just still confessing it
[6:32] that away so just you know pray at the
[6:34] Lord would would touch him and his
[6:36] sister Anna Canard I think is going for
[6:38] a uh
[6:41] and what you call it
[6:43] catheterization this this week so
[6:46] remember that and remember all of these
[6:48] others that are are set up for these
[6:50] things and and all to to be we're all
[6:54] getting older as we do the the doctors
[6:56] gets to making a Better Living
[7:00] that's the only part about getting old
[7:02] is we help out to doctors
[7:04] you know so maybe they're getting
[7:07] getting rich off of us but that's all
[7:09] right I appreciate doctors I believe in
[7:12] them I just don't depend on everything
[7:14] they tell me when God tells me something
[7:17] then I depend upon that but but just
[7:19] remember these the other announcements
[7:21] and all but now we kind of got it to a
[7:23] point this morning and I don't want I
[7:25] know we're not going to have questions
[7:26] and answers this afternoon so hold your
[7:28] questions till Wednesday if you're not
[7:30] planning on being here give them to
[7:32] somebody
[7:32] and let them turn them in because I
[7:34] still have
[7:36] 30
[7:38] still have about 28 quotes to read so
[7:41] I'm trying to get this into our minds
[7:43] and get one thought now I wrote myself a
[7:45] note I was thinking about it yesterday
[7:47] and I know see people think that I'm
[7:50] preaching to try to contradict somebody
[7:52] else
[7:53] or try to prove somebody else wrong
[7:56] and and that's never been my goal
[8:00] my goal is to understand truth
[8:04] all right
[8:05] and to preach to you the truth
[8:08] to where you can have a choice right
[8:10] right then that way you can listen to
[8:12] somebody else and if you agree with them
[8:14] that's fine with me uh you know I don't
[8:17] have no problems but I don't do it to
[8:20] try to straighten people out you know to
[8:22] show they're wrong
[8:24] really what I do if you think about it
[8:26] my my kind of ministry style has been to
[8:29] take topics that were like Daniel 70
[8:33] weeks and the seals the godhead the
[8:36] things and predestination is to not try
[8:40] to show how wrong people are but show
[8:43] how wonderful
[8:44] the truth is
[8:47] you know to see how wonderful and the
[8:50] way that God lays out things
[8:53] and speaks it it's it amazes me more
[8:57] every day I look at it just like we were
[8:59] using that scripture there this morning
[9:00] you know that uh
[9:02] if we are The Offspring of God they're
[9:04] in Acts
[9:05] why would we think about God being to
[9:08] godhead being anything else other than
[9:10] what we are
[9:12] you know we're The Offspring
[9:15] well the godhead wouldn't be gold and
[9:17] silver you know image is made it
[9:20] wouldn't have anything to do with those
[9:21] things well I love scripture like that
[9:23] when it opens up to where that I can see
[9:26] it and I'm trying to speak to you the
[9:28] truth not try to show nobody else up
[9:30] wrong
[9:31] because you can't do that anyway
[9:33] you know there's no way you're not going
[9:36] to convince anybody it takes God to
[9:39] reveal
[9:40] there's no man you can't argue you know
[9:42] out argue anybody they'll keep with
[9:45] those same thoughts and ideas and won't
[9:46] do it but just keep that in mind and say
[9:49] well brother Dale you sound like you are
[9:50] we'll pray for me then if I move over
[9:53] into that part
[9:54] you know don't worry about it the holy
[9:57] spirit will start saying lit up you know
[10:00] and I began to let up and go and
[10:02] straighten up you know so you pray for
[10:04] me all right
[10:05] but we're talking about being chosen in
[10:08] him or we titled it for today I told
[10:11] them just to leave the same for this
[10:12] afternoon
[10:13] and put a part two onto it of a chosen
[10:15] generation
[10:17] you know a generation is a race of
[10:19] people a kind a group or a stalker or uh
[10:23] you know uh something that's mourned and
[10:27] we know that we are his offspring there
[10:30] we ended up in the book of Acts all
[10:32] right be in The Offspring of God not
[10:34] being something God
[10:36] made
[10:38] see that's our thoughts if we get tied
[10:40] up into to thinking about well this is
[10:42] the way God made it well I I don't look
[10:45] at it like that I I look at it as what
[10:48] we are
[10:50] we are the people of God and if Jesus
[10:53] wasn't the second person why would we
[10:55] want to think about ourselves as being a
[10:57] second person what a wonderful
[10:59] opportunity to be the children of God
[11:02] and being children of God means
[11:06] we're a very part of him
[11:09] and the way Jesus was was God made
[11:12] manifest in flesh so are we
[11:15] we're the lies we're talking about last
[11:17] night we're the last in morphe the last
[11:20] form of God
[11:21] you know brother martin brother Donnie
[11:24] was talking about where I preached in
[11:26] 1999
[11:28] on multiple uh forms
[11:31] you know and trying to get us to see the
[11:34] understanding of the godhead well you
[11:36] know we're the life form of God
[11:38] to the Gentile dispensation now you'll
[11:40] go to the Jews and reveal himself
[11:42] but to the Gentiles we're the lies for
[11:44] we're the last God the people are going
[11:46] to say yeah but that is when you say
[11:50] we're God that this shakes me and all
[11:52] that Thrills me
[11:54] you know to know the truth about it
[11:57] and not to run it off into a garbage can
[11:59] but to see that it the Bible said it is
[12:01] he that hath made us and not we
[12:04] ourselves
[12:05] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[12:08] pastor
[12:09] why is it that we would be concerned
[12:12] about trying to get into every other
[12:15] form when we have so much truth
[12:18] to follow
[12:19] and that's all I'm trying to do is
[12:20] preach the truth to you all right now
[12:23] that's just the best I can do and always
[12:25] will try to do all right now
[12:28] now back up a little bit you know and
[12:30] remember we know that he predestinates
[12:33] by his foreknowledge
[12:34] right all right but now we're on back
[12:36] past
[12:37] the point of a predetermining situation
[12:40] back into the part of seeing that we're
[12:43] a part of God
[12:45] the new birth that you have
[12:47] is a part of God not if we was back
[12:50] there as people's identities little
[12:53] spots little little things you know
[12:56] no way
[12:58] we were only his attributes
[13:00] all right then an attribute is a part of
[13:03] him
[13:04] and he has three attributes Father Son
[13:06] and Holy Ghost all right so then we must
[13:09] some way be tied up in those
[13:11] uh thinking of the attributes
[13:14] and the attributes of God are you know
[13:16] the very thoughts of God
[13:19] and and that would make you and I part
[13:22] of that one that would be doing the
[13:24] thinking instead of just something that
[13:26] he thought of
[13:28] that's what I'm wanting us to see
[13:30] when we see that then we're on down the
[13:33] road a little further
[13:35] all right but we ended up this morning
[13:37] talking about chosen in him
[13:40] not chosen of him
[13:43] see if you're chosen of him then he's
[13:45] picking out what he wants
[13:47] and that's predetermining
[13:50] Factor all right
[13:52] but if we're chosen in him
[13:56] then all we got to do is find out how he
[13:58] was in him
[14:00] well as I said we wasn't backed ours
[14:03] people we want little little things
[14:05] running around
[14:07] he wouldn't we wouldn't out
[14:08] fellowshipping with him
[14:10] that's the point if we'd been out
[14:12] fellowshipping with him he would have
[14:13] never brought us down to here
[14:16] right because he would have been having
[14:18] Fellowship he brought us here where the
[14:20] fellowship could be your children are a
[14:22] part of you right
[14:25] but you didn't know him or have any
[14:27] thoughts about him
[14:29] I mean you know did you get together and
[14:31] say okay now honey me and you are going
[14:33] to have three kids we're going to name
[14:35] them Wade and Terence and Anna
[14:38] no
[14:40] no we didn't
[14:41] like I said I'm the 13th so so he'd have
[14:44] to do a whole lot of thinking
[14:46] to get down to that situation all right
[14:48] but now think about it
[14:52] there's a lot of difference in being
[14:53] chosen in him are chosen of him or by
[14:57] him
[14:58] you know a lot of difference in the
[15:00] thought and we should get it to where
[15:02] that we can can uh
[15:06] see our own selves
[15:09] because you know to see who he is
[15:14] all right
[15:16] but then once he began to reveal who he
[15:19] is he is
[15:21] it automatically revealing Who You Are
[15:25] I mean that's an automatic process
[15:27] because you're part of him and not part
[15:30] of another person or doings or whatever
[15:32] all right
[15:35] now we've got down to
[15:38] reading and started off on reading some
[15:41] quotes
[15:43] and uh
[15:46] let's see it seven times I'm pretty
[15:48] certain
[15:50] that he uses the word
[15:51] if we have eternal life
[15:56] there's three times he said if you have
[15:58] eternal life
[16:00] there's
[16:01] when I get 17 times
[16:04] that the prophet said if you've
[16:07] got eternal life or have eternal life
[16:10] all right
[16:11] and each one of those has got the if on
[16:13] it
[16:14] right and that's all I've ever tried to
[16:16] get people to look at
[16:18] to you to look at on one thing
[16:21] and the prophet said you always was
[16:23] eternal
[16:24] look and see what he's saying he said if
[16:27] you have eternal life
[16:29] you always was eternal now it's only
[16:33] used two times
[16:36] about always was eternal
[16:40] I gave it and then the other night I'll
[16:43] get one of them this afternoon I know
[16:44] but one of them is works is Faith
[16:46] Express the other one is things that are
[16:48] to be
[16:49] the only time that brother REM actually
[16:51] uses you always was eternal
[16:54] you know that very statement all right
[16:58] but you just calculate what I gave you
[17:00] that would be somewhere around 46 times
[17:03] that a prophet is asking a question
[17:07] or as I said this morning now
[17:11] you say but that's not a question that's
[17:13] a statement
[17:15] well thank God either way it's right
[17:19] a statement is made
[17:21] because of a situation we're in or
[17:24] whatever and we think about it
[17:26] and brother Joe ran me off the word if
[17:28] you know
[17:29] and uh
[17:31] you know I wouldn't intend to bring it
[17:33] but I'll read what he's got on here
[17:35] see the word if like in Genesis where it
[17:37] says and if thou doest well
[17:39] that word if is a conditional clause
[17:44] a possible situation
[17:48] an impossible situation
[17:50] an oath context
[17:53] it means like no
[17:56] it means weather
[17:58] it means when whenever our sense
[18:02] interrogative particle
[18:04] but rather that's the word the word if
[18:06] mean that's Old Testament Version New
[18:08] Testaments means
[18:10] the word if means accept
[18:12] if not
[18:15] whosoever not means but you know you can
[18:18] say but instead of saying if
[18:21] you know
[18:23] if no
[18:24] before if not unless whoever
[18:28] just a little word if
[18:32] and I'm trying to get you to look at it
[18:35] then as to think about it whether you
[18:37] want it as a question or whether you
[18:39] want it as a statement
[18:42] that dealing with the fact of eternal
[18:44] life the prophet will always you say
[18:46] he'll always be saying if you have
[18:49] eternal life
[18:51] so that puts a situation to me
[18:56] that where there was a time you didn't
[18:57] have it
[18:59] all right
[19:01] then you receive it you have it
[19:04] but then that does no problems with it
[19:06] when he would say you always was eternal
[19:11] if he's talking about us as people look
[19:14] where we're messed up I sure don't feel
[19:16] Eternal today
[19:18] you know
[19:19] 73 I don't feel like
[19:22] Eternal I feel good but not Eternal all
[19:25] right
[19:27] but
[19:31] when you're putting the word if you're
[19:33] questioning the point
[19:35] the if the spirit
[19:37] that was him dwelling you
[19:40] all right
[19:41] see it's putting it to the position that
[19:43] then you're you're you're making a
[19:46] statement like
[19:48] if you have eternal life I can say to
[19:50] you that eternal life you have always
[19:53] was eternal
[19:57] you don't give eternal life to eternal
[19:59] life
[20:01] and see then if you come into the world
[20:03] with eternal life as people are trying
[20:06] to believe
[20:07] within how you're going to get eternal
[20:08] life
[20:10] well I don't need to get it already had
[20:13] it well then you you never was lost
[20:15] you can't make Eternal loss an eternal
[20:19] tied together
[20:22] redeem
[20:23] is to bring us back
[20:25] all right now I haven't got on to that
[20:28] yet so that'll be six months down the
[20:31] road
[20:31] remember to redeem I asked a question
[20:34] one time I said how far back would you
[20:36] like to be redeemed
[20:40] well I want to be redeem back where he
[20:43] predestinated me
[20:44] well then you've done stopped away short
[20:46] from where we are discussing the message
[20:49] see
[20:51] to redeem to me is going to have to be
[20:53] go back to where I was at originally
[20:58] and me as a person was never there
[21:00] originally you wouldn't either
[21:02] but we were the eternal life that we
[21:05] have
[21:07] that's why Redemption comes here we
[21:10] don't have to wait till we go there
[21:12] to be redeemed we're being redeemed now
[21:15] it's coming into being all right now
[21:17] let's read a lot of quotes then and not
[21:19] spend a lot of time commenting but just
[21:21] try to read it and see that each point
[21:25] will be driving it that
[21:29] you and I
[21:32] we were lost
[21:35] doomed and on the way to hell
[21:38] people don't like that see because they
[21:40] want some kind of something to tell them
[21:42] you know
[21:43] all they were
[21:44] I'm a firm believer in the new birth
[21:47] I'm a firm believer and you must be born
[21:49] again
[21:51] and in doing that then that means you
[21:53] were born wrong to start with
[21:55] and that birth will never do you no good
[21:57] but you're born Jesus said from above
[22:01] that's what the original translation
[22:03] says born from above born from where he
[22:06] come from
[22:07] all right see then we're getting to that
[22:10] point of sin so let's start off now
[22:12] let's read a whole lot this afternoon
[22:16] I kind of hollered too much this morning
[22:18] so
[22:20] let's start off with number seven where
[22:22] we were at this morning the god rich in
[22:24] Mercy
[22:25] now all of these except one will be
[22:30] in the 64 6
[22:32] 364-65. all right
[22:34] now what
[22:36] and if you've got eternal life tonight
[22:39] if we have eternal life now this will be
[22:42] that we have the next will be you out
[22:44] then the next will be
[22:46] if you've got eternal life all right
[22:51] then we always were
[22:53] because there's only one form of eternal
[22:55] life
[22:56] we always were and the reason we were
[22:58] because we are a part of God
[23:03] all right now and God is the only thing
[23:05] that's Eternal so now if you're going to
[23:07] believe you come in the world with
[23:08] eternal life
[23:11] you know I'm speaking this out on the
[23:13] internet system
[23:14] if you're going to believe that
[23:17] why don't you believe it correctly
[23:20] you ought to Rejoice about being part of
[23:23] God
[23:26] instead of running it into the flesh all
[23:28] right
[23:29] he goes on to say
[23:31] now we are part of God see now
[23:34] you always was you don't remember
[23:36] because you were only an attribute in
[23:38] God you were only in his thinking
[23:43] only in his thinking
[23:45] an attribute
[23:46] well see I don't want to predestinate
[23:48] myself out of existence
[23:51] I want that eternal life to come this
[23:53] way
[23:55] I'm not trying to go back there
[23:58] go did we go back there we would go back
[24:00] to him being self-existent
[24:03] that's why I said Redemption is here
[24:06] we get our Redemption here we get a
[24:09] change of the body we get the whole
[24:10] thing here
[24:11] we don't have to wait to get to heaven
[24:13] all right go ahead with number
[24:15] eight
[24:17] this will be taken from the Harvest Time
[24:19] 64 12.
[24:22] when there was just him alone talking
[24:24] about eternal
[24:26] and if we have eternal life there is
[24:29] only one form of eternal life and that's
[24:30] God's life
[24:32] for if we have eternal life now there's
[24:34] three times see
[24:35] a question apart
[24:38] so if we have eternal life
[24:41] we were with God right then
[24:44] a part of God
[24:47] but then what does he say we were his
[24:49] attribute
[24:51] now he's explaining it
[24:53] almost every one of these quotes is
[24:55] going to have attribute tied into it or
[24:57] thoughts
[24:58] all right
[25:00] see
[25:01] so if we have eternal life
[25:06] now that's a question about whether we
[25:08] have it or not
[25:10] we have to admit everybody doesn't have
[25:12] it
[25:13] right
[25:14] now if we do then we were with God right
[25:17] then a part of God we were his attribute
[25:19] we are now his attribute and he goes in
[25:22] the beginning with the word so we were
[25:25] his thoughts then expressed into word
[25:27] and become what we are
[25:30] all right attributes okay
[25:34] look at number nine take them to who is
[25:37] Jesus 1964 6 20. the B part and now all
[25:42] is the same same as we are born again
[25:47] we've got eternal life if we have
[25:49] eternal life there is only one form of
[25:52] eternal life that's God's and we are
[25:55] attributes of him
[25:58] where's attributes okay go on 10.
[26:02] Christ is identified 64 4 14 for 15
[26:06] excuse I got 71. he's Eternal and he's
[26:10] the only source of eternal life there is
[26:11] is in God our Father he's Eternal
[26:13] himself now therefore if we have eternal
[26:16] life
[26:17] we have part of God in us
[26:20] and God in us well that's you know
[26:22] that's just true he's just making a
[26:23] statement like we make right and if he's
[26:26] then that's the only way you could have
[26:29] eternal life is something that was watch
[26:31] this statement now it isn't something
[26:34] that was manufactured
[26:37] then given to you by some Creed are you
[26:41] lived into it you grew into a better man
[26:45] or a better woman it's God himself in
[26:48] you
[26:49] just like you're a part of your father
[26:51] here on Earth you're part of your
[26:52] heavenly father and what you are you've
[26:55] you're the attribute of his thoughts of
[26:58] you before the foundation of the world
[27:00] you've you've expressed he had to breed
[27:04] it in and everything and get what you
[27:06] are to make you what you are then when
[27:10] we was completed then this come on it
[27:13] just goes into another thought go to the
[27:15] next Investments
[27:17] listen to 62 now
[27:20] uh
[27:24] investment 62 11 24.
[27:28] and there's only one thing
[27:30] that ever never had a beginning and that
[27:32] was God and when the Bible speaks there
[27:35] I don't think I'm misquoting it
[27:37] before a great scholar and a great Greek
[27:40] Greek scholar and a Greek man the word
[27:42] Zoe means God's own life then if we how
[27:45] see the reason I'm jumping down from 64
[27:48] 65 to 62 is to keep this we have
[27:52] it appears seven times or eight times
[27:54] then if we have eternal life the Greek
[27:57] word Zoe means that we have part of
[27:59] God's own life
[28:00] because we become a part of him
[28:05] that's simple if you have the new birth
[28:08] you're a child of God
[28:10] right all right
[28:14] because you're part of him there's only
[28:16] one form of eternal life and that's God
[28:18] God is eternal he never did begin and he
[28:21] never can end and the only way you can
[28:23] be Eternal with him is to come part of
[28:27] him
[28:29] and you can't be it till you come part
[28:31] of him all right and the only way that I
[28:33] can be a Son of God is to become part of
[28:35] God
[28:36] then I have to be born of his spirit
[28:39] amen that's it so all your
[28:41] denominational Creeds and invest in
[28:43] eternal life I like that all right going
[28:46] to the next
[28:48] he says number 12.
[28:50] questions and answers in 57
[28:54] um
[28:55] 0 9 25 wrote it on up to the bottom
[28:59] you read all of these things and read I
[29:01] give them to you like that to where you
[29:02] can have them but you see everything
[29:04] that's perverted has an end to it
[29:07] because it it'll finally must come back
[29:09] to that Purity and Holiness of God and
[29:13] God is eternal and if we have eternal
[29:15] life God is in us and we can no more die
[29:19] than God can die there you are
[29:22] see all of them dealing with what
[29:26] if
[29:27] we all right now jump to the next we'll
[29:29] start back up to 65 221 the evening who
[29:33] is this male charity now you're going to
[29:35] deal with if you have
[29:37] notice those who have tonight eternal
[29:40] life was with him and in him in his
[29:42] thinking before their
[29:44] Ever Was An Angel star cherubim or
[29:47] anything else that's Eternal and if you
[29:49] have eternal life you always want us
[29:53] not your being here but the shape and
[29:56] form of the infinite God
[29:58] did ask him a question there on question
[30:00] and answer we're Spirits or anything he
[30:02] said no you wouldn't nothing you just in
[30:04] his thinking
[30:07] well see then you're going to
[30:08] predestinate Yourself clean out of
[30:09] existence
[30:11] with the doctrines of mankind look at
[30:13] the next one
[30:15] is wisdom versus Faith 62 401. now if
[30:19] you have eternal life today
[30:22] you are in God
[30:24] by God's being in you
[30:29] you are God's expressed out
[30:32] how are you going to be in God by God
[30:33] being in you what is that not the
[30:35] scripture where it says I in you
[30:38] and you and me
[30:41] is that what Jesus said I in you and you
[30:44] and me
[30:45] now
[30:47] we can talk about God coming here but
[30:49] what about in me and you you know I and
[30:52] you and you and me
[30:54] we don't never deal with us being in him
[30:56] we deal try to deal with him coming in
[30:58] US
[30:59] but if we're a part of him look where we
[31:01] are go ahead
[31:04] is your life worthy of the Gospel 63 301
[31:07] if it's the word and God said so that
[31:10] spirit in you will cope with that word
[31:12] every time
[31:13] cause genuine Holy Spirit Will quote
[31:15] with the word because the word is life
[31:17] and spirit Jesus said my words are life
[31:20] and if you've got
[31:23] now we're up to the you've
[31:25] if you've got eternal life
[31:27] and here's the word how can the word
[31:29] deny the word
[31:32] if you've got eternal life
[31:34] go ahead so now we're dealing on the
[31:36] youth if you've got eternal life
[31:39] identification 64 216. so the life
[31:43] that's in you never did begin and never
[31:45] can end think of it it came in because
[31:48] anything that is eternal ever began the
[31:51] life that's in you never did begin that
[31:54] is if you've got eternal life
[31:58] now you're going to argue with that
[32:00] being a question so go ahead or a
[32:02] statement and that's God for you was in
[32:05] his thought from the beginning see all
[32:08] of it is Basis you get into my point
[32:10] everything is basing upon
[32:12] when he says you're Eternal is basing
[32:15] upon
[32:16] if you have eternal life
[32:19] the eternal life part is what's Eternal
[32:21] all right go to the next one
[32:26] sir as we would see Jesus 1964-301
[32:30] and if you were in his thinking at the
[32:32] beginning
[32:33] if you got eternal life there is only
[32:35] one form of eternal life eternal life
[32:37] and no beginning it has no ending so if
[32:40] you have eternal life
[32:42] you still questioning right you were an
[32:45] attribute of God's thinking before there
[32:47] was anything but him your form your
[32:50] shape and what you are now is just a
[32:52] negative when you come up to this around
[32:54] 20 when God takes a picture of you all
[32:58] right go on I won't just read these
[33:02] this is taking concerns we would see
[33:03] Jesus 64 318 paragraph 81 82.
[33:08] in the beginning God was not even God he
[33:11] was great Eternal and there was
[33:12] attributes attributes was his thoughts
[33:14] and then he become a word like this in
[33:16] the word express what a thought
[33:18] expressed is a word a word expressed is
[33:20] a thought
[33:21] and then remember if you ever was in
[33:24] God's thinking
[33:29] you'll always be there
[33:32] well because you're part of him
[33:35] if you've got eternal life
[33:38] you are the expression or the attribute
[33:40] of his thought for this age
[33:42] if not you there is only one eternal
[33:46] life and it always existed in you and in
[33:48] his mind existed before there was a
[33:51] world that's the reason he said he chose
[33:53] you before the foundation of the world
[33:55] it isn't what we think what somebody
[33:59] else thinks it's what God
[34:03] eternal it's God Eternal
[34:06] Eternal excuse me God Eternal you always
[34:08] was see in his thinking all right so we
[34:13] were always in his thinking
[34:16] but it's what I've tried to explain to
[34:18] you everybody wasn't always in his
[34:20] thinking like we think about it
[34:24] because his thinking is part of him
[34:27] now Judas was in his thoughts of life
[34:33] right
[34:34] Judas was in his thoughts of what would
[34:36] happen when we come see when we get
[34:38] through this question and answer now
[34:39] you're going to see us start
[34:40] condescending back this way
[34:43] to see what we're doing all right going
[34:45] to the next one
[34:48] oh the voice of the sign
[34:51] there is only one form of eternal life
[34:54] if you've got eternal life then you
[34:56] yourself was in God's thinking before
[34:58] the world was created
[35:00] you're an attribute he was thinking
[35:02] could Eternal never did begin or never
[35:04] can end you're a part of God's economy
[35:07] always it's just reflecting it's
[35:09] becoming now you've got one more picture
[35:11] to develop
[35:14] right that's death
[35:16] then the negative becomes positive and
[35:19] you're in the bride and with Christ as
[35:21] he thought one more to be done we'll
[35:24] skip the bottom one because it's just a
[35:26] reading of saying uh you've got eternal
[35:28] life you were an ordained to be a
[35:30] certain thing maybe a good housewife
[35:32] something else nobody can take your
[35:35] place okay go ahead to the next
[35:38] just reading all of these
[35:40] to where you'll see that everything is
[35:42] tied to an attribute a thought
[35:46] of what you're doing so all right so
[35:48] we're on uh the identified Christ of all
[35:50] ages 64 401 rolling them up
[35:55] how is he is now in you
[35:59] you are his attributes if you've got
[36:01] eternal life your life always was
[36:04] and you was God's thinking
[36:07] the color of higher whatever you are you
[36:09] as God thinking and you're just
[36:11] materialized
[36:13] what brother Dale you're sure they're
[36:16] saying exactly no I'm not saying exactly
[36:18] what everybody else is saying
[36:21] I'm saying a prophet is questioning
[36:25] or a statement either way you want to
[36:27] make it
[36:28] as to a point
[36:30] that we must have eternal life
[36:33] to be able to say we have eternal life
[36:36] we've had to experience receiving
[36:38] eternal life everybody doesn't have
[36:40] eternal life
[36:41] even as we were talking about last night
[36:43] there's going to be people at the white
[36:45] Throne judgment will be given eternal
[36:47] life right foolish virgins Etc you know
[36:50] that they'll never be part of the Bride
[36:54] they can't stay in the city
[36:58] right
[36:59] only those in the city will be the bride
[37:02] and 144 thousand
[37:05] why because the 144 000 received their
[37:07] life here
[37:10] right they don't have to wait till
[37:11] somewhere else or they get their life
[37:12] here so they stay in the city
[37:14] and other people have to go in and out
[37:16] of the city right
[37:19] it all ties together when we see it
[37:22] all right go ahead to the next one
[37:28] this is taken from the Heavenly
[37:30] bridegroom you know the future home as
[37:32] we call it of the Heavenly bridegroom
[37:33] and the Earthly bride I even like that
[37:36] title you don't hear people expressing
[37:38] that title
[37:39] the future home of the Heavenly
[37:42] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[37:45] now are we Earthly
[37:48] no but we're people
[37:51] they asked me a question in life not
[37:52] I'll answer it I'll answer it now they
[37:54] said somebody asked me I said
[37:57] where was God before the world
[38:02] I said I don't have no problem with him
[38:03] being in the future home
[38:05] what do you think
[38:08] I have no problem with him being in the
[38:10] future at home
[38:12] he's building it according to our
[38:14] desires
[38:16] he said yeah but you're making God
[38:18] something tangible something well I
[38:20] thought that's what we're supposed to do
[38:21] I thought he was
[38:23] see no God is just a spirit
[38:26] it's flowing or no he's got it God is a
[38:29] being
[38:32] God ripped the skin off the animals in
[38:35] the garden
[38:36] to pay the price for Adam and Eve he
[38:38] must be pretty physical
[38:42] and brother Branham said to them was
[38:44] Bloody flapping skins
[38:47] on Adam and Eve
[38:49] you see but but brother Dale you're just
[38:51] making God something real I wish I could
[38:58] remember him said we get over there he
[39:00] said angels will beat everywhere
[39:04] because they're real
[39:05] how much more real is God
[39:08] come on Church
[39:11] what do we got a future home
[39:14] look what he says
[39:17] the he's talking about the uh to learn
[39:20] the educated and we'll get back to this
[39:22] statement later again but look what he's
[39:24] talking about the the Pharisees the
[39:26] scholars the things you know
[39:28] he could not recognize it
[39:31] why couldn't those people recognize
[39:34] why no matter how scholarly he was
[39:36] anything like that he still didn't have
[39:40] representation of predestination
[39:44] he didn't have it only the predestinated
[39:48] will be the ones who does it
[39:50] only can be and you only can be can do
[39:54] it because look it proves predestination
[39:58] because if you've got eternal life you
[40:01] had to be a part of God
[40:02] all times because he's the only ones
[40:05] eternal if you've got eternal life
[40:08] go on to the next
[40:12] is taken from the Harvest Time
[40:15] 1964 12.
[40:18] but if you've got eternal life you never
[40:20] did begin and you cannot end because
[40:22] your sons and daughters of God
[40:24] attributes of his thoughts and his word
[40:27] you have no ending of life if your name
[40:31] is on that book come on
[40:35] God who is rich in Mercy 65 119.
[40:39] if you've got eternal life tonight if we
[40:42] have eternal life then we always were
[40:44] because there's only one form of eternal
[40:46] life we always were and the reason we
[40:49] were
[40:50] because we are a part of God
[40:53] and God is the only thing that's Eternal
[40:55] you understand I'm just reading or just
[40:58] read them all to you
[40:59] and let you think about it
[41:02] if we have eternal life
[41:04] that eternal life always existed
[41:09] but there was a day I didn't have it
[41:13] yeah but brother Dale you don't
[41:15] understand I agree with you I don't
[41:16] understand
[41:17] I'm trying
[41:19] go to the next one
[41:21] I want to see you take all these quotes
[41:26] you know I want to see somebody take all
[41:27] these quotes and prove something about
[41:29] me that was eternal before the world
[41:34] as I said this morning that's exactly
[41:36] what we're doing we're taking the quotes
[41:39] that they use to prove
[41:41] that you always was eternal
[41:44] or you come in the world with eternal
[41:45] life thank you
[41:47] I'm taking the same quotes to show what
[41:50] if we come into the world lost
[41:52] but if we have eternal life today then
[41:55] that eternal life always was eternal
[41:58] that's the simple terminology is to me
[42:00] simple thought
[42:02] I don't see why there would be any
[42:03] problem but
[42:05] they are God's power transformation 65
[42:08] 911 Sons and Daughters of sons and
[42:11] daughters were in God at the beginning
[42:12] now look
[42:14] you've got eternal life you say well we
[42:17] believe it that we got eternal life well
[42:19] there's only one form of eternal life
[42:21] and that's God's that's the only thing
[42:23] that is eternal is God and if you've got
[42:26] eternal life that life that's in you
[42:28] always was and you were in the loins of
[42:31] God before there even was the world
[42:36] see if we believe we come in the world
[42:38] with eternal life what's any need of
[42:39] preaching what's he need to preach Jesus
[42:41] dying
[42:46] you say well why would a prophet make
[42:47] that statement we haven't got to that
[42:48] yet
[42:50] we're going to get down into some more
[42:51] Thoughts with it
[42:55] he's certainly not trying to show us
[42:58] that we don't need Calvary
[43:02] that we don't need salvation
[43:04] that we don't need to receive Jesus
[43:06] Christ as our savior
[43:08] would you realize what people are doing
[43:10] the pastors of these churches and I
[43:12] they're putting that into the
[43:13] congregation's mind and they're not
[43:15] going to seek the Lord
[43:19] that's the old Baptist two seeds in the
[43:23] spirit
[43:24] don't try to get them saved God is going
[43:26] to save them anyway
[43:34] look at the next one
[43:40] this is taken from thirst
[43:43] 1965 919. now remember if you've got
[43:47] eternal life your life was in God at the
[43:49] beginning and the life God is the word
[43:52] and then when the word was made flesh in
[43:55] Jesus Christ God coming down to dwell in
[43:58] his own body made himself the Son of God
[44:02] when God came down to dwell in that you
[44:06] were in him
[44:08] when he was crucified
[44:12] okay
[44:15] now do you believe that
[44:20] how many statements do you need of that
[44:22] form
[44:23] that we walked in Minnesota Galilee we
[44:25] died in him he went to hell
[44:27] in my place
[44:29] Etc
[44:31] I want to ask you a simple question then
[44:36] if we were in him
[44:39] as he died was crucified
[44:43] then are you saying that
[44:46] he started some way right there from
[44:48] then on dropping a seed into
[44:52] people
[44:55] that would eventually turn out to be
[44:57] an eternal life
[45:01] because maybe you didn't catch what I
[45:02] said this morning
[45:03] the prophet said there was a speck or a
[45:06] spot or he'll call it
[45:08] of eternal life
[45:10] I'm talking about a person of eternal
[45:12] life
[45:14] there's a vast difference in a spot in a
[45:15] person
[45:17] but if we were in him
[45:20] when he was crucified
[45:22] now what was in him
[45:25] what part of us
[45:26] was in him
[45:29] everybody else wants to make him come
[45:31] over put something in US spots you know
[45:33] I'm doing this whatever
[45:35] but if we were in him what were we when
[45:39] we were in him
[45:44] are you listening
[45:46] some of you are getting catching on a
[45:49] little bit ain't you
[45:53] what were we
[45:56] when we were in him
[46:02] now
[46:04] you say well we were these little little
[46:06] dots and spots that they want to draw
[46:07] out and make a picture
[46:09] oh look at that that's you that right
[46:11] there Danny that was kind of got his
[46:12] head turned up to her kind of looked a
[46:14] little you know odd
[46:17] but
[46:21] we was in him when he was crucified
[46:23] now what part of us was in him when he
[46:26] was crucified
[46:28] I'm waiting on an answer from somebody
[46:35] the only way we could be in him
[46:37] would be his wages stated to be a part
[46:40] of that eternal life
[46:43] that was in him
[46:52] you see that I'm concerned about what I
[46:54] was in him
[46:57] and then tied it all the way back to the
[46:58] beginning I find out
[47:01] that if I have eternal life
[47:04] the eternal life that was released from
[47:06] him
[47:08] and this is one you can't answer
[47:13] ain't no need in trying it
[47:15] you say well you're sure sarcastic well
[47:18] will I finish the statement and see
[47:24] where were we in him
[47:30] you know that the Holy Spirit had
[47:32] already left the body
[47:36] the soul of God had left the body
[47:39] and it was hanging on a tree
[47:42] right
[47:44] you with me
[47:47] the bride was still in his side
[47:53] are you with me
[47:55] spear went into his side
[47:58] to show what he'd done died of a broken
[47:59] heart
[48:01] water and blood came out of his side
[48:04] the prophet said that was when the bride
[48:06] was released
[48:09] now I don't know the answer to that one
[48:16] I want somebody to answer that for me
[48:21] the Holy Spirit stole everything was
[48:24] done gone
[48:27] but the bride was still in his body
[48:32] there are some statements that can't be
[48:34] explained
[48:35] the spear brought out the blood the
[48:38] water and it brought the bride out
[48:44] I mean
[48:48] do you understand I'm asking you a
[48:50] question I love questions
[48:53] what part of him would we what part were
[48:56] we
[49:01] with eternal life
[49:05] but you know what came out of him
[49:09] was the bride
[49:11] now I'm going to State what I believe
[49:14] I said I can't answer well State what I
[49:16] believe
[49:19] I believe that word was still in him
[49:24] and that Spirit went inside the blood
[49:26] and the water came out
[49:29] because that's what Jesus was talking
[49:31] about when he was talking to Nicodemus
[49:36] he said you've got to be born of what
[49:40] that's what he said to Nicodemus
[49:43] you've got to be born to water and blood
[49:46] the two elements that was left in his
[49:48] body
[49:51] all right now the answer to me is
[49:56] that
[49:56] eternal life
[49:59] that left out of him
[50:02] was the Eternal God
[50:05] but the word and the spirit was still in
[50:07] a place that needed that problem and may
[50:10] I go on a little farther
[50:12] brother Brown said there was 120.
[50:15] Little Seeds words drawn back up in the
[50:20] upper room this is all spoken word
[50:22] original seat waiting on the spirit to
[50:25] bring it life
[50:28] so we better be worried about
[50:30] justification
[50:33] water
[50:34] sanctification blood
[50:38] and life of eternal life
[50:41] the new birth
[50:43] we better believe the new birth
[50:47] all right
[50:49] let's get to that point
[50:51] if we were crucified in here if you were
[50:53] crucified with him and you died with him
[50:56] on Calvary you was buried with him
[51:00] on the mountain
[51:02] and you Rose with him on Easter morning
[51:05] and now you're sitting together in
[51:07] Heavenly places in him and now you've
[51:10] got fellowship with him
[51:12] the same eternal life that Jesus Christ
[51:15] had is living In You and I by the new
[51:18] birth
[51:20] but you got to come by the water and the
[51:22] blood
[51:23] to get your eternal life
[51:26] okay going to the next
[51:31] this is the message I've heard but now I
[51:34] see 65 11 27.
[51:39] but through a betting ground of your
[51:41] mother
[51:42] you were made manifest in his likeness
[51:44] talk about being a gene German your
[51:46] father Etc
[51:47] and then he could talk to you
[51:50] the god the great God if you got eternal
[51:53] life then the germ of eternal life was
[51:56] in God at the beginning
[51:58] and you were there you were in his
[52:01] thinking your name and all and he by
[52:04] foreknowledge ordained you to see this
[52:07] in you that was not ordained will never
[52:10] see it
[52:12] so that's the way I want to see it don't
[52:14] you look at the next
[52:17] the right excuse me the rapture
[52:19] 65.
[52:22] um 1204. now so you were in you so were
[52:27] you in if you got eternal life
[52:30] you were in God before there was a world
[52:33] and you are a part of God a Son of God
[52:37] an attribute of God
[52:39] he know the very age you were coming he
[52:42] predestinated you to that age now we're
[52:44] good to that that'll be a couple of
[52:46] messages later how that he could look
[52:49] down through and see you
[52:51] and he did predestinate you
[52:54] by his foreknowledge
[52:58] to be what you are all right
[53:01] look to the next we only got a few more
[53:03] we'll this is taken from the messiest
[53:06] things there ought to be 1205 65. go
[53:09] ahead and roll it up
[53:11] wherever you are God knew that you would
[53:14] be here because you have to be one of
[53:16] his genes or his attributes you had to
[53:19] be
[53:20] if you ever if you've got eternal life
[53:23] then it always was eternal life
[53:26] and God before there was a foundation
[53:28] World knew that you would be here and
[53:31] when the word or the water the washing
[53:35] of the water of the word fell upon you
[53:37] you it was expressed in a being now you
[53:41] have fellowship with your father God
[53:43] just as you have with your Earthly
[53:45] father going to the next
[53:47] trying to read Feist
[53:49] life preached in 1958 now we drop down
[53:52] all right showing that he was teaching
[53:54] this back there
[53:56] people say he changed his Doctrine as he
[53:58] come along and he kept gaining ground
[53:59] well let's see
[54:03] now there's life there's one kind of
[54:05] eternal life and that's God's life and
[54:07] he when you receive that you have
[54:09] eternal life but life has many
[54:12] interpretations as it comes down now
[54:14] here's what people say that he changed
[54:16] the they say he believed back there in
[54:19] receiving eternal life
[54:22] you know Newburgh but when he got into
[54:24] the 63 4-5 did he believed you always
[54:27] was eternal
[54:29] now I'd like to see that in writing from
[54:31] him
[54:33] that's your concept of what you think
[54:36] that he progressed I'd like to see his
[54:38] statements on it all right and his life
[54:41] had no beginning and it'll have no
[54:43] ending and if you've got eternal life
[54:46] then you have no end to eternal life
[54:49] it's forever in your character is proven
[54:52] by the life that's in you
[54:54] whatever we do with it will prove the
[54:56] life of it right going to the next
[54:59] 1959 707 bombing Gilead listen to you
[55:04] all of you hear me on the day of
[55:06] Pentecost when these people had received
[55:08] the new birth and had received eternal
[55:11] life
[55:14] you know
[55:15] of course he changed his way of doing
[55:17] later you know come on I don't
[55:20] if you got eternal life in you you can
[55:23] demonstrate eternal life
[55:26] you abstain from the things of the world
[55:28] going to the next
[55:32] holy God
[55:34] just a few more
[55:37] all right this is taken from uh
[55:39] questions and answers on the Holy Ghost
[55:40] 1959 12 19.
[55:44] so roll it on up for you
[55:47] has got eternal life but you believe but
[55:51] we believe
[55:52] if you've got eternal life if God has
[55:55] give you eternal life
[55:58] you got it forever
[56:00] that's what I believe
[56:02] that if God has given you eternal life
[56:04] he's given me eternal I've got it
[56:06] forever
[56:08] and then it's just as Eternal as him so
[56:10] that was part of him in the beginning
[56:14] but I must receive it
[56:18] let's read the rest of them give me
[56:20] these are a little bit added to
[56:22] this is from the message Souls that are
[56:25] are
[56:26] in prison now 63 11 10. but the soul
[56:31] that's in Darcy that soul is what God is
[56:33] working on
[56:34] see if he can only get that nature that
[56:38] Spirit to agree with him then that
[56:40] nature dies
[56:42] the nature and the love of the world
[56:44] dies
[56:46] and the things of the world is dead
[56:50] let me stop for a second you know that a
[56:52] seed ain't worth nothing until it dies
[56:56] right
[56:58] seed seed ain't worth a thing till it
[57:00] dies
[57:03] okay
[57:05] and the things of the world is dead see
[57:07] because if you love the world of the
[57:08] things of the world the love of God is
[57:10] not in you see and a man must be born
[57:12] again so this Nature has to die
[57:15] and the nature of the world comes and
[57:17] excuse me nature of God comes and lives
[57:21] in you and God is the only thing that
[57:24] thing there is that never did begin or
[57:27] never can end go ahead to the next
[57:31] this is the token 64 201 208
[57:34] when he said you must be born again
[57:37] now remember this is up in there where
[57:39] the souls in prison we just read and
[57:41] this one is up into the point where they
[57:43] say changed all this
[57:45] don't sound much like it
[57:47] when he said you must be born again that
[57:49] don't mean jump up and down after altar
[57:50] that don't mean walk back there and
[57:52] shake hands with a pastor that don't
[57:54] mean all this foolishness that we've
[57:56] seen done it don't mean putting your
[57:58] name on a church book it means Death to
[58:01] Your First being
[58:04] and life to the second being it means
[58:07] that the blood has been applied and
[58:10] you've identified by the life of Jesus
[58:12] Christ and if he be the vine and we be
[58:16] the branches and the life that's in the
[58:18] branch is in also from Divine it'll fire
[58:22] the fruit all right
[58:24] well the life in the vine and the
[58:26] branches has got to be the same you
[58:27] understand well I know the branch buys
[58:30] the fruit
[58:31] the vine is is produces the life but
[58:33] it's got to be the same all right one or
[58:36] two more
[58:40] this is taken from Georgia to real three
[58:44] which is 64 404
[58:47] but if God said so that makes it so
[58:52] there ain't no surely to it
[58:55] you must be born again
[59:02] you got to receive the Holy Ghost either
[59:05] that or perish
[59:09] now so you got a choice
[59:12] that's in 64. those lies three or four
[59:14] was reading of the 64 3 and 4. in word
[59:18] of people say he changed his Doctrine
[59:23] he come up with a new doctrine
[59:25] a new idea
[59:27] well I'd like to know where he said he
[59:30] changed it at because on the message the
[59:32] future home
[59:34] he said I taught three processes
[59:38] ever since I was a boy
[59:40] future home was preached in 64.
[59:44] he never changed his Doctrine
[59:47] he just lost mankind when he began to
[59:50] talk about
[59:51] eternal life
[59:56] he lost mankind when he began to talk
[59:59] about the eternal life that you have
[1:00:03] is a part of God
[1:00:07] and that means that you are God made
[1:00:09] manifest
[1:00:12] that's where he lost mankind that's
[1:00:14] where he's lost the people in their
[1:00:16] doctrines and ideas
[1:00:18] he was not trying to say we didn't need
[1:00:19] to be saved
[1:00:22] he was trying to tell us
[1:00:24] the day you receive eternal life
[1:00:27] that eternal life always was eternal
[1:00:31] now can I quote the scripture that we
[1:00:34] read over and over 16 times now
[1:00:39] those who he justified
[1:00:44] he's already sanctified
[1:00:47] those who he sanctified
[1:00:49] he's already glorified
[1:00:56] so when we receive eternal life
[1:00:59] that soul is just as Eternal as it'll
[1:01:03] ever be
[1:01:04] that has nothing to do with growth
[1:01:06] development understanding and you know
[1:01:07] doing that that has to do with eternal
[1:01:09] life
[1:01:13] and what you don't believe brother we
[1:01:15] come here with a spot in us I believe a
[1:01:17] lot of things that we'll get to I
[1:01:19] believe one that I just covered a few
[1:01:21] weeks ago
[1:01:25] that you and I
[1:01:29] I'm not going to bring that one because
[1:01:31] it got down so he didn't want it
[1:01:35] you and I
[1:01:38] have the opportunity to receive
[1:01:43] the greatest message that has ever been
[1:01:47] to explain
[1:01:49] eternal life
[1:01:50] to explain the children of God
[1:01:56] and Who We Are
[1:01:58] and to see
[1:01:59] brother Marlo what we are
[1:02:03] we're the life form of God
[1:02:08] in this dispensation
[1:02:11] and being that
[1:02:13] we have
[1:02:15] eternal life
[1:02:17] we were truly then chosen in him
[1:02:20] we are truly then a royal priesthood a
[1:02:24] chosen generation
[1:02:26] of peculiar people
[1:02:32] because we're his children
[1:02:35] you know that we have many titles you
[1:02:37] know we talk about him with titles come
[1:02:39] ahead Brothers get ready
[1:02:41] we have many we talk about him having
[1:02:43] many titles you know that we have many
[1:02:46] titles
[1:02:48] we're his children we're his offspring
[1:02:50] we're his wife
[1:02:52] we're his bride
[1:02:54] and many more can you name just off the
[1:02:56] top of your head
[1:02:58] we have many manifestations
[1:03:01] to ourselves just as he has many
[1:03:03] manifestations
[1:03:06] we're a royal priesthood
[1:03:11] whereas once a priest was over his house
[1:03:14] or you know or things you know that
[1:03:17] Daddy was the thing now every one of us
[1:03:20] have access
[1:03:22] to go before the Throne of God
[1:03:26] you don't have to call me up say brother
[1:03:28] Dale pray for him that's wonderful
[1:03:30] that's good
[1:03:33] you know
[1:03:34] because we have the opportunity for
[1:03:36] ourselves
[1:03:38] sometimes I admit sometimes I get the
[1:03:41] feeling so bad I wish somebody would
[1:03:43] pray for me because I don't feel good
[1:03:46] enough to even pray for the South
[1:03:48] maybe you ain't never felt that bad but
[1:03:50] you know you get the feeling so bad you
[1:03:52] don't even know how to pray
[1:03:54] you want somebody to come along pray for
[1:03:56] you
[1:04:00] but then we read a quote this morning
[1:04:03] that I hope would start bear with you
[1:04:08] brother Mark
[1:04:09] if we have eternal life
[1:04:12] and that's life living in us which is
[1:04:14] God's own life
[1:04:18] then who's asking for the healing of
[1:04:20] these bodies
[1:04:23] he don't want to be in a sick body
[1:04:29] right
[1:04:31] that's why my wife years ago said look
[1:04:33] at her said no wonder then we can ask
[1:04:35] it's called it's a father in us doing
[1:04:36] the ask and that's what the scripture
[1:04:38] says the father do it the speaking
[1:04:41] don't be concerned what you're going to
[1:04:43] say the Father doeth the speaking
[1:04:45] is God in us
[1:04:48] asking to be delivered from these
[1:04:51] things
[1:04:52] because he's not satisfied in a sick
[1:04:54] body
[1:04:56] he's not satisfied in an old body
[1:04:59] you know why I know that because he's
[1:05:01] fixing to change these
[1:05:07] amen eternal life
[1:05:12] why didn't one more question
[1:05:16] if we're born with this seed in us and
[1:05:18] all these things when that seed come to
[1:05:20] life
[1:05:21] and everybody wants to make it even a
[1:05:22] little woman at the whale or whoever
[1:05:25] Why didn't it change these bodies
[1:05:33] I said I love questions but I like to
[1:05:35] ask them
[1:05:37] even when the disciples received eternal
[1:05:39] life on the dead Pentecost Why didn't it
[1:05:42] change their bodies
[1:05:43] it quickened them
[1:05:45] brought him into a position for living
[1:05:47] for Christ yeah but it never gave their
[1:05:49] bodies eternal life
[1:05:53] why not if eternal life is just throwing
[1:05:56] it out and just
[1:05:57] you know some spot some thought
[1:06:01] and I believe eternal life is a person
[1:06:05] and we're going to get down to this seed
[1:06:07] and always talk about where it wrote
[1:06:09] around and said there's a seed for every
[1:06:10] age
[1:06:12] and somebody's got to make that live
[1:06:16] you and I have a seed to make live folks
[1:06:18] and that seed is not to just realize
[1:06:21] that brother Branham was a prophet
[1:06:27] that's age and time is dire
[1:06:30] some people are just now receiving that
[1:06:32] that's the age and time to seed
[1:06:34] but to those who walk in the word it's
[1:06:36] like I told the brothers years ago and
[1:06:38] they even wrote back from it
[1:06:40] I said sure we're going to these
[1:06:42] countries you go there and you you you
[1:06:44] get them to the message but the next
[1:06:47] year you don't go back and tell them all
[1:06:48] about the message you know the messenger
[1:06:51] you tell them the message well they sent
[1:06:53] word from a country over there and said
[1:06:55] we've heard that right around as a
[1:06:57] prophet now come and teach us what he
[1:06:58] said
[1:07:03] eternal life is a person let's stand
[1:07:07] give you a short afternoon man it ain't
[1:07:09] even 3 30 yet
[1:07:12] questions and answers on Wednesday
[1:07:18] write them down and then hand them to me
[1:07:20] and let me think about it a little
[1:07:24] because I believe in it what we got for
[1:07:27] it
[1:07:38] to the Lord
[1:07:58] I don't
[1:08:03] know
[1:08:39] I would
[1:08:42] be nice
[1:08:51] brother want the park laws
[1:08:56] pacemaker put in that everything will be
[1:08:59] all right
[1:09:03] he said I've seen God to heal he's been
[1:09:05] healed of many things I'm taken
[1:09:07] yesterday
[1:09:10] uh today too brother Richard Wilson I'm
[1:09:12] talking to him about it he's got a
[1:09:14] kidney stone so pray for him you pray
[1:09:16] for him because you know you had it
[1:09:17] years ago Brothers Thomas
[1:09:20] told it he had a kidney stone that it
[1:09:23] was impossible
[1:09:25] it was somewhat large it was impossible
[1:09:27] to pass
[1:09:32] doctor said you might as well get ready
[1:09:34] we gotta operate
[1:09:37] he called the doctor up in another
[1:09:39] another day or something he said doc
[1:09:42] said you still think I came I said
[1:09:45] kidney stone he said there's no way it's
[1:09:47] too large he said I got it here in my
[1:09:50] hand
[1:09:51] he said we went to the church and we
[1:09:54] prayed and said God
[1:09:57] no you know what the doctor said he said
[1:09:59] don't tell nobody about that how do I
[1:10:02] lose a lot of patience
[1:10:06] we believe that we've seen God heal
[1:10:10] so let's believe that brother right
[1:10:12] father in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:10:16] lay our hands upon our brother believing
[1:10:17] that by your stripes he's healed and
[1:10:20] we're going to believe that you don't
[1:10:22] have to have this operation well this
[1:10:24] the pacemaker put in
[1:10:26] because we've seen you
[1:10:29] If You Are the Healer deliver
[1:10:32] you are the one that I spoke of all of
[1:10:34] these days
[1:10:37] Eternal and then it's not me asking
[1:10:39] forever

[1:13:48] asking for The Neighbors
[1:13:52] that you
[1:13:59] would in Jesus
[1:14:20] Christ

[1:17:35] straight into your word and realize
[1:17:36] realization
[1:17:38] we believe what the prophet has said
[1:17:40] unto us
[1:17:42] but we just know for sure did it
[1:17:46] the people must be born again before
[1:17:47] they have eternal life
[1:17:50] and in doing that then we can only have
[1:17:52] it by representation
[1:17:54] of a predestination until that time
[1:17:56] comes

[1:18:00] it anything you want to
