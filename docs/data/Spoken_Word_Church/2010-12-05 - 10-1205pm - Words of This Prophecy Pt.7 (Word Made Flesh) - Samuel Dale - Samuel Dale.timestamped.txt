[34:46] you know the hindering reasons and lord
[34:49] you just commit everything into your
[34:51] hand
[34:52] guide us now and keep us in jesus name
[34:55] amen
[34:59] revelations one we've read this many
[35:02] times but
[35:03] we'll keep on reading it the revelation
[35:06] of jesus christ which god gave unto him
[35:09] to show unto his servants things which
[35:11] must shortly come to pass
[35:14] and he sent and signified it by his
[35:16] angel to his servant john
[35:18] who by record of the word of god and the
[35:20] testimony of jesus christ
[35:22] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[35:25] he that readeth and they that hear the
[35:26] words of this prophecy
[35:28] and keep those things which are written
[35:30] therein for
[35:32] the time is at hand
[35:35] now let's go to revelations uh three
[35:38] everybody knows
[35:39] verse 14 we'll just read that and then
[35:41] we'll go over to verse 21 and 22
[35:45] and unto the angel of the church of the
[35:47] lady of siam's right
[35:49] these things saith the amen the faithful
[35:51] and true witness
[35:52] the beginning of the creation of god
[35:56] verse 20. behold i stand at the door
[35:59] knock if any man hear my voice and open
[36:01] the door
[36:02] i will come into him and will shut with
[36:04] him
[36:05] and he with me to him that overcometh
[36:08] will i grant to sit with me
[36:10] in my throne now remember brother random
[36:13] is covering it that means we really only
[36:16] but you know even also as
[36:20] even as i also overcame and sat down
[36:23] with my father
[36:23] in his strong he that hath an ear let
[36:26] him hear what the spirit saith
[36:28] unto the churches you may be seated the
[36:30] lord had his
[36:31] blessing to the reading of the word
[36:38] now
[36:40] we're trying to look at these things and
[36:44] see the book of revelations and
[36:46] see how that it unfolds and to me it
[36:50] unfolds
[36:51] you know like the things that as i've
[36:54] said
[36:55] the prophet of god covered it one day he
[36:57] said no there's not a lot written about
[36:58] the church
[37:01] and the reason it's not a lot written
[37:03] about the church to me now
[37:06] is i believe that the church must come
[37:09] to the place
[37:10] until she becomes i want you to listen
[37:16] the church will become the word made
[37:20] flesh
[37:22] all right now we'll prove the point in a
[37:24] minute we'll get back to it that doesn't
[37:26] discredit down through any word
[37:28] because the new birth is the birth of
[37:30] the word
[37:32] and i show you where the prophet of god
[37:34] said luther
[37:36] had the word made flesh in his day
[37:40] in him all right so don't just get it
[37:43] that we're having to wait for over here
[37:46] but the very important part is this is
[37:48] our
[37:49] end of the story this is to you and i
[37:53] we thank god for all the other things
[37:56] but it's to you and i
[37:59] the hour that we're living and that's
[38:01] what i want to talk about now this is
[38:03] words of prophecy number seven but the
[38:05] subtitle or the next title is word
[38:08] made flesh now i want you to keep that
[38:12] in your mind
[38:14] that you know you say well we can't be
[38:17] that
[38:19] and brother branham i'll give it to you
[38:21] in a little while
[38:23] he said it outside of the corporal body
[38:26] of jesus christ that he was here
[38:30] just like he was now
[38:33] you can take what you want to for
[38:36] because that's that's up to you
[38:38] it's like i was trying to prove this
[38:40] morning
[38:41] or show the point that when we were
[38:44] speaking about
[38:45] angelic beings uh there was an angel
[38:48] come to john
[38:51] all right and that angel that come to
[38:54] john
[38:55] revealed to john the entire book of
[38:57] revelation
[38:59] right all right now uh
[39:02] that's the catch of what i'm trying to
[39:04] show you because here in the chapter one
[39:08] you you've got to deal with that and we
[39:10] find out that that was almighty god that
[39:12] we're talking about
[39:14] in bride form standing in the midst of
[39:17] the seven golden candlesticks like unto
[39:19] the son of man
[39:20] gird about the pouts with a golden
[39:22] girdle so it would be in the feminist
[39:24] form
[39:25] all right and see it being that see we
[39:28] don't look for that to be
[39:30] the one that john uh fell down before
[39:34] in chapter one we know automatically who
[39:37] it is
[39:38] it's almighty god well then
[39:42] as we go along you know in throughout
[39:45] the
[39:45] the series you'll see it unfold more and
[39:48] more
[39:49] but my point this morning was what
[39:52] do you believe in angelic beings
[39:57] do you believe in angels when the
[39:59] prophet of god said
[40:00] all born-again believers
[40:04] have angels
[40:07] there was a sign to you as we read this
[40:11] morning
[40:12] hebrews 1 4 14 to
[40:16] be ministers of to bring us
[40:20] unto salvation
[40:23] those angels as i said this morning that
[40:25] it once
[40:26] guarded the tree of life to keep man
[40:29] away from it
[40:31] see after then the the uh the lord jesus
[40:34] christ coming
[40:35] now those angels are trying to run us to
[40:38] that tree of life which is the word of
[40:40] god all right
[40:42] and then trying to drive us through that
[40:45] they are
[40:46] the ones that are heirs of the salvation
[40:49] they have an angel to lead them
[40:54] and see you think well well no it's just
[40:56] the holy spirit
[40:58] when we read about three times this
[40:59] morning where the prophet of god said
[41:02] that people say well in this day brother
[41:05] random it's just a holy spirit
[41:07] he said that's not true
[41:11] he said there are angels he said because
[41:12] peter had one that come to him
[41:15] and said he already had the holy ghost
[41:17] but an angel come and got him out of
[41:19] jail
[41:20] paul had an angel in the boat to tell
[41:22] him about and he already had the holy
[41:24] ghost
[41:26] so then what is the angels of god
[41:30] they are those things that our thing
[41:33] what is it the beings that god
[41:35] created because they were the first
[41:37] thing god created was angels
[41:41] and see we just think that's just
[41:42] spirits with your spirit well see you
[41:44] keep going that way
[41:47] and when you do you're just going to
[41:48] totally do away with god being real
[41:52] because you're just going to take him
[41:53] back as to being a spirit
[41:55] right no he's a being
[42:00] those angels are real they are beings
[42:04] they're not just a cloud floating around
[42:06] or a good warm feeling
[42:08] you know and i gave it to you to end
[42:11] that the prophet said i reason for the
[42:13] fact that we
[42:14] don't see the angels of god
[42:18] he said god gave you an inward
[42:21] birth and from that you're supposed to
[42:24] follow god
[42:26] the outward birth we follow the natural
[42:28] but in the inward birth
[42:30] the then we're supposed to make contact
[42:33] with the supernatural god
[42:35] and why can't we believe for angels come
[42:37] and appear to us
[42:41] see that's where we mess up and don't
[42:43] believe it
[42:46] but then it's not to just say oh i've
[42:48] got an angel like he's feeling
[42:51] no i believe you
[42:54] i believe he's there because he's
[42:59] he's to be with those that without
[43:01] salvation
[43:03] to take care of us now
[43:07] in that then whether it be a messenger
[43:12] of earth
[43:13] a natural angel that we covered
[43:18] whether it be a investigating angel
[43:23] with flying saucers that the prophet
[43:25] talked about
[43:28] whether it be heavenly beings
[43:32] why can't we believe they're real
[43:38] well i just can't see how they're real
[43:39] well why
[43:42] well i can't see them well you've never
[43:46] seen jesus so that means you ain't saved
[43:50] that's what you're doing you don't
[43:52] realize it
[43:54] you're placing god so far away from you
[43:56] until he can't come to you
[44:00] why can't you believe angels are more
[44:02] real than you are
[44:04] well that's just where dude i just
[44:06] believe that this this kind of a spirit
[44:07] like
[44:08] we'll see that you're going to make god
[44:09] that
[44:11] or whatever the angels are remember they
[44:14] rotated off of god
[44:17] that's what your prophet said
[44:20] joe why can't we believe right
[44:26] now let's don't be silly you know and
[44:27] say wait now you're sitting on my angel
[44:30] i know what no um
[44:37] anna and julie used to have their
[44:41] buddies
[44:43] and they didn't want you to sit down in
[44:45] a certain place because
[44:47] their buddy was sitting there
[44:50] but they did have a good imagination
[44:54] it's not like that folks this is real
[44:59] salvation is real it is not just a
[45:03] well i feel like i'm saved but tomorrow
[45:07] i won't feel too good
[45:08] so i wonder where i am or not
[45:12] god is real the angels are real
[45:18] we are the reason that they don't
[45:20] contact us
[45:24] we are the reasons because we get other
[45:27] things in a way okay i gave it to you
[45:29] this morning
[45:31] but the they're ministering spirits
[45:34] to guide us to god
[45:38] no matter what i was saying whether it
[45:40] be an earthly messenger
[45:42] like brother brown church age messengers
[45:45] preachers
[45:46] whatever they're to guide us to god
[45:53] and then doing that see we can come out
[45:55] to be
[45:56] being the heirs of salvation they're
[46:00] actually ministering
[46:02] righteousness to us salvation peace
[46:06] you know like brother random wouldn't it
[46:08] be something
[46:10] for you to talk to an angel and an angel
[46:11] said don't you have no fear
[46:15] don't be afraid or nothing i'll be with
[46:18] you
[46:21] which oh that was just for brother brown
[46:25] now you're limited in yourself so that's
[46:28] the reason god can't contact you
[46:32] i believe he's here for all of us
[46:37] but around his angel won't help me
[46:41] but now here's the point i wanted to
[46:42] make sure we got
[46:44] even though brother brown had an angel
[46:46] to come to him at birth you know there
[46:48] and followed him all the time
[46:50] that angel didn't save him
[46:54] that angel could only lead him to god
[46:57] they don't
[46:57] that angel could only say don't drink
[46:59] don't smoke don't you
[47:00] there'll be a work for you to do right
[47:06] and that's you know you see
[47:10] those angels rotating off of god
[47:14] would they not be a part of god amen
[47:21] you know why can't we believe it all
[47:23] right
[47:26] but see we just say well it was just a
[47:28] holy ghost
[47:32] see then we're limiting ourselves and
[47:35] destroying
[47:36] all of the things and then we'll
[47:38] automatically look to
[47:41] brother bradley had an angel right well
[47:44] now miss plain and blunt
[47:48] if he had one
[47:51] and the prophet of god said i ought to
[47:52] redeem thy angels
[47:55] then we're the ones limiting it
[47:58] god's done what he said he'd do believe
[48:01] it
[48:01] all right see they are sent from god
[48:07] they are under control directly of the
[48:10] holy spirit
[48:11] amen
[48:15] and then by being in control of the holy
[48:18] spirit sin of god
[48:20] that angel couldn't tell brother brown
[48:22] something contrary to the word
[48:25] but you know what i love about it we
[48:27] were talking about it yesterday
[48:31] see when that angel would come and tell
[48:33] brother around something
[48:36] he proved he was a child of god
[48:39] you know how he spent the rest of the
[48:43] day checking the scriptures
[48:46] right he spent the rest of the day
[48:49] checking the scriptures
[48:50] to see what the angel said was right
[48:52] right
[48:54] there's a true childhood amen
[49:02] now let's get on to something that i've
[49:05] mentioned
[49:06] many times and i want to keep mentioning
[49:10] it
[49:11] now even though
[49:15] a messenger even though we could call
[49:18] him a prophet
[49:20] even though we would talk about an angel
[49:24] even jesus come to the disciples and led
[49:27] them
[49:28] for three and a half years but you know
[49:31] he couldn't reveal anything to him
[49:37] it takes the holy spirit to reveal it
[49:41] they can bring us to the channel they
[49:43] can lead us and guide us
[49:47] but you can't save us
[49:50] it takes the holy spirit to do that
[49:53] now after
[49:58] now we read in genesis 1 the revelation
[50:02] that god give to jesus to give to john
[50:04] and sent and signified by his angel okay
[50:07] now after that angel
[50:11] come to john to tell john
[50:15] of the book of revelations
[50:19] don't forget that jesus christ
[50:22] stepped on the scene to john
[50:28] now you understand what i mean
[50:31] that throw an angel a prophet or anybody
[50:34] tell you something
[50:35] if god don't step on the scene to reveal
[50:46] you mean you believed it that jesus
[50:48] christ
[50:49] well i'll find it somewhere in here
[50:59] i'll find it a minute
[51:04] it don't make no difference god has to
[51:06] reveal it
[51:08] or we don't get it that's the whole
[51:11] thing
[51:12] no what happened at patmos
[51:18] now follow me
[51:23] god give to jesus a revelation of jesus
[51:25] right
[51:29] and he gave it to an angel to bring it
[51:32] down to you and i in other words to
[51:33] record it
[51:35] he'd come to john all right
[51:39] but now get the point keep it in mind
[51:41] see
[51:42] then jesus steps on the scene to john
[51:50] he doesn't just leave it in an angel's
[51:52] hands he comes to make it known to john
[51:59] has that happened in our lives
[52:05] has brother branham been able to bring
[52:08] the word to you and i enough that jesus
[52:12] christ could step out of that word
[52:15] that's right do you and i
[52:18] it becomes something personal to us
[52:23] i thought that's what he's supposed to
[52:24] do
[52:31] what did john see
[52:34] i'm talking about john patlisten
[52:38] he saw
[52:42] the word made flesh
[52:48] he said oh wait just a minute now john
[52:50] the baptist once saw that
[52:53] i agree with you john the baby saw that
[52:57] but what if i could show you that
[53:01] jesus christ became so real
[53:04] that he's the word my flesh
[53:08] in your flesh right amen
[53:11] okay all right now let's see if we can
[53:14] follow that
[53:16] because when john saw what he saw
[53:23] automatically chapter two and three
[53:26] which is the seven church ages
[53:29] that's red letter edition in your bible
[53:32] which means that that's what jesus said
[53:37] so the proof was the angel could deliver
[53:41] the thought
[53:42] but he can't reveal the thought he can't
[53:45] make it manifest
[53:50] that's where people miss it on the
[53:51] adoption of series and things you know
[53:55] and brought around talk about
[53:56] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[53:58] of god
[54:00] and all i've ever heard preach out of
[54:02] that outside of just a few that's around
[54:04] with us pretty close
[54:07] all i've ever heard preach out of that
[54:08] is look at brother brown he can make the
[54:10] word manifest
[54:12] jesus can make the word manifest that's
[54:14] all we need is for them and not for us
[54:18] they don't even look up the word
[54:19] manifest the word manifest is to make
[54:22] known
[54:28] the angel made known to john
[54:31] what john needed
[54:35] and then when he made it known
[54:38] god stepped on the scene to vindicate it
[54:43] is he doing that to me and you
[54:47] see we've got to make him known
[54:50] we see everybody i want to be made known
[54:52] all right you show your great big stuff
[54:54] shirt
[54:55] you show you're not writing the gospel
[54:58] right because this is not to make you
[55:00] and i know
[55:01] it is to make him known
[55:04] right don't worry about it you make him
[55:07] known
[55:08] do you make you known i've never been
[55:11] worried about he's always took care of
[55:12] me
[55:14] but if i try to make myself known what
[55:16] do i get
[55:20] but if i'll make him known look at the
[55:22] word manifest see
[55:24] manifested sons of god brother and said
[55:26] that uh outside of this day where was it
[55:28] to be manifested sons
[55:30] well i just don't fit in you brother
[55:32] dale what are you looking for
[55:39] well i want to see you raise the dead
[55:40] heel to sit
[55:43] well you got all afternoon
[55:48] you want to talk about what god has done
[55:55] if you got the goods you don't have to
[55:56] worry about it dude
[55:59] i've seen everything but blinded eyes
[56:01] open i used to say i've seen everything
[56:03] with the dead rays but
[56:06] we got an opportunity
[56:09] and god raised a man from the dead
[56:13] his eyes would roll back and what could
[56:16] we do
[56:18] why did i do it
[56:22] wade can tell you he said daddy we got
[56:25] to do something this man is dying
[56:29] all i done was one thing his name is
[56:32] randall
[56:34] and i said randall
[56:41] what does that say looked around
[56:46] i believe god raised him from the dead
[56:50] he said well what was it doing i know
[56:54] that there was something different about
[56:55] that
[56:56] sound and why would i do it that way
[57:03] so you can say well that makes no no no
[57:05] this makes jesus christ
[57:08] that's all it makes don't make nothing
[57:10] out of me in you
[57:13] no way it makes jesus christ
[57:18] jesus christ came to john
[57:22] after john delivered the message now
[57:26] listen i i don't know how to get this
[57:27] together right here so please listen
[57:29] and try to help me
[57:33] the revelation come to jesus to give to
[57:36] the angel to give to john right
[57:41] but now when you're getting it look what
[57:44] it's actually doing
[57:45] the revelation come to give jesus to
[57:47] give to the angel
[57:50] to give to john but then immediately
[57:52] jesus steps on the scene
[57:57] you don't talk about the angel in
[57:58] chapter two and three
[58:01] now come on we got there it don't talk
[58:04] about the angel of god in chapter four
[58:06] either
[58:09] because you better believe one thing for
[58:10] certain it's not a red letter
[58:13] but john heard a voice in heaven say
[58:16] come up
[58:17] right amen the angel could only write
[58:21] that
[58:22] down
[58:27] you could only have john keep it
[58:30] together and let him write it
[58:33] he couldn't call the dead right
[58:41] so are we putting more emphasis upon the
[58:43] angel are we putting more emphasis upon
[58:44] jesus christ
[58:50] all right
[58:54] see jesus was the word you agree
[59:00] in the beginning was the word word was
[59:01] with god and the word was god in verse
[59:04] 14 said and the word
[59:05] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[59:08] you agree that he was the birth of the
[59:10] word
[59:11] the birth of what those prophets built
[59:14] his body
[59:15] he was that in manifestation
[59:20] now
[59:24] who would know more about what to do
[59:26] then
[59:27] to bring that word once again
[59:30] in the flesh
[59:37] now i'm going to make my statement and
[59:38] then you listen
[59:41] that's the reason chapter 2 and 3 is in
[59:43] red letter because jesus is showing you
[59:46] that it's him in the church
[59:50] it's not the church the bride you know
[59:52] it's him and the bride
[59:54] he's showing you his position because
[59:57] that was what was to be made known
[59:58] he didn't know his place in the kingdom
[1:00:00] right
[1:00:02] come on your prophet said he didn't know
[1:00:06] page 11 12 13 right in there over the
[1:00:08] church hitch book
[1:00:09] he didn't know his part in the kingdom
[1:00:11] but said when he come to general
[1:00:12] batman's he didn't know
[1:00:14] he knew exactly what the ages was going
[1:00:16] to be
[1:00:17] and he knew his part in the ages
[1:00:28] read something
[1:00:32] look at number one on your notes
[1:00:37] i quoted this the other night and i
[1:00:38] figured people
[1:00:40] you know would doubt the
[1:00:43] total of what i was
[1:00:47] really quoting so i decided maybe we'd
[1:00:49] read it
[1:00:51] and it's looking under jesus preaching
[1:00:53] phoenix arizona 1964.
[1:00:59] john the greatest of all
[1:01:03] prophets he was the one that introduced
[1:01:06] jesus
[1:01:08] jesus said he was greater than any man
[1:01:12] had been born now listen
[1:01:16] did you ever think why that was
[1:01:24] are you reading what brother said
[1:01:27] did you ever think why that was did you
[1:01:29] ever think why it was
[1:01:31] that john was the greatest of all the
[1:01:36] prophets
[1:01:42] he was the messenger of the covenant
[1:01:46] jesus christ was the angel of the
[1:01:47] covenant but john is the messenger of
[1:01:48] the covenant
[1:01:50] he stood between law and grace to
[1:01:52] introduce jesus christ
[1:01:55] but watch your prophet join the greatest
[1:01:59] of all prophets
[1:02:01] he was the one that introduced jesus
[1:02:03] jesus said he was greater than any man
[1:02:06] had been born did you ever think why
[1:02:09] that was
[1:02:11] now watching me will answer you all the
[1:02:14] rest
[1:02:15] of them spoke of him and all the
[1:02:18] prophets involved
[1:02:20] the word of the lord comes to the
[1:02:21] prophet
[1:02:23] that's the bible said so
[1:02:27] and all and in all the other prophets
[1:02:30] that come to them
[1:02:32] in visions
[1:02:35] but when the word came to john
[1:02:40] it was flesh jesus was the word
[1:02:44] he is the word he always was the word
[1:02:48] but here is where the fullness of god
[1:02:50] was made flesh
[1:02:52] and dwelt among us when he come to him
[1:02:55] in the water he was a prophet and if the
[1:02:58] word is made flesh he's got to come to
[1:03:00] the prophet
[1:03:02] the word wherever it is it must come to
[1:03:04] a prophet
[1:03:05] because the prophet is the one the word
[1:03:07] comes to and
[1:03:09] john was the prophet of the day now you
[1:03:11] see why john is the greatest of all the
[1:03:13] prophets
[1:03:15] when i found out when i had a little
[1:03:17] shout out
[1:03:22] he's the greatest from all the pride man
[1:03:28] why
[1:03:30] all the other prophets that would say in
[1:03:32] the scripture if you'll read it
[1:03:33] that the word of the lord came in a
[1:03:35] vision you know it saved the old
[1:03:37] testament prophets
[1:03:38] or the word of the lord was precious in
[1:03:40] the people of the day
[1:03:43] it would say those things because why
[1:03:44] because the word came
[1:03:47] even though melchizedek
[1:03:52] met abraham
[1:03:55] even though moses would see the great
[1:03:58] things that he saw
[1:04:02] but still john is greater and you know
[1:04:05] that john's ever done one miracle
[1:04:12] never to do away with our talks about
[1:04:13] well it's gotta be gotta be miracles
[1:04:16] john the greatest of all never done one
[1:04:18] miracle
[1:04:24] but he saw the word that was made flesh
[1:04:30] the greatest honor could ever be
[1:04:33] was to walk out in that water that day a
[1:04:36] man
[1:04:38] that john could turn and look
[1:04:42] and say from nine years old when i went
[1:04:44] into the wilderness
[1:04:46] until this day i waited
[1:04:50] but i was told
[1:04:54] what i must do john what are you
[1:04:57] supposed to do
[1:04:58] i'm the one i'm the voice or the one
[1:05:01] crying in the wilderness
[1:05:03] prepare ye the way isaiah 40
[1:05:07] running there 42 everyday
[1:05:11] john saw the word made flesh
[1:05:17] what a wonderful thing to think about
[1:05:22] no
[1:05:27] can you not realize them
[1:05:30] that when john
[1:05:33] was there on patmos now that was john
[1:05:36] the baptist it's on that okay
[1:05:39] nobody understand now john
[1:05:42] the writer and one of the apostles
[1:05:48] when he comes to patmos
[1:05:52] what does he see
[1:05:59] well he just saw a vision of no you
[1:06:02] didn't get what i was laying down there
[1:06:03] a moment ago
[1:06:06] the angel could bring it to john
[1:06:10] but the angel couldn't write down what
[1:06:13] was put in 20
[1:06:14] verse chapter 2 and 3.
[1:06:19] and angel couldn't do that jesus came
[1:06:22] under sin
[1:06:25] john is seeing in the church ages the
[1:06:28] word made flesh
[1:06:31] now we should go home you'd have
[1:06:34] computers
[1:06:35] and just run in word made flesh
[1:06:40] or word flesh you know and just
[1:06:43] read all the things we would be here to
[1:06:46] pass 12 o'clock
[1:06:49] i got a bunch of lead on my desk
[1:06:53] about the word flesh
[1:06:56] see if you have the new birth
[1:07:00] never born again believer had the new
[1:07:02] birth
[1:07:06] right amen and that was the birth of the
[1:07:08] word
[1:07:12] because that's your new birth is the
[1:07:13] verse of the word and we were talking
[1:07:15] about in the bible study last night
[1:07:18] in the baptism in the holy ghost but the
[1:07:19] birth of the word
[1:07:22] that's why nicodemus couldn't comprehend
[1:07:27] he said you must be born again
[1:07:31] like what he was saying he didn't say
[1:07:32] that there was no nicodemus and
[1:07:34] you got to be anointed
[1:07:36] you've got to shout you got to do it no
[1:07:37] he said you must be born again
[1:07:43] every born-again believer for the day
[1:07:46] they were living was the word made flesh
[1:07:51] now let's see if you can swallow
[1:07:55] every prophet
[1:07:58] that ever brought the word to any age
[1:08:04] he was that word made flesh
[1:08:11] that's why they couldn't comprehend him
[1:08:14] that's why isaiah could sell virgins
[1:08:16] y'all conceived and
[1:08:18] he just couldn't understand that's why
[1:08:20] moses could write
[1:08:21] five books and tell you what happened in
[1:08:23] genesis
[1:08:29] you know it is so close until
[1:08:33] moses was god to the people
[1:08:38] that's what the bible says what's your
[1:08:40] prophet says
[1:08:43] for the hour he was living the word was
[1:08:46] made
[1:08:47] flesh he spoke it out of his lips
[1:08:51] that automatically sealed it up
[1:08:54] right because there was nobody that
[1:08:56] could comprehend what he'd say
[1:08:59] right that's what people don't
[1:09:02] understand anything when brother brown
[1:09:04] spoke it
[1:09:04] like that really opened it up now we run
[1:09:06] around smoking that's sealed
[1:09:11] it takes the holy spirit to reveal it
[1:09:16] i can talk all day long
[1:09:19] and do you no good but one word from god
[1:09:27] will give you the word make flesh
[1:09:31] you're understanding what john saul
[1:09:33] papers
[1:09:39] he saw jesus christ
[1:09:42] in the church down through seven ages
[1:09:48] right and they were the word made flesh
[1:09:52] for the hour that they were living amen
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:56] just as those prophets with the word
[1:09:59] make flesh
[1:10:02] for the day that we're living then john
[1:10:08] comes
[1:10:11] and he introduces the word
[1:10:16] no did not brother brown say
[1:10:21] that this prophet in the end time would
[1:10:23] be pointing to a word
[1:10:25] born bride
[1:10:28] that's what god thanks to you and i
[1:10:32] he didn't write as we mentally thinking
[1:10:35] of mine see
[1:10:38] we think well god was doing pretty good
[1:10:39] in the early church
[1:10:41] second third maybe fourth church age but
[1:10:44] then the fifth and sixth and seventh is
[1:10:46] just
[1:10:46] oh just so small
[1:10:50] you better read your bible
[1:10:55] it's odd how the bible is written
[1:10:59] it doesn't say that he was standing in
[1:11:02] the life stage
[1:11:07] read your bible one in the midst
[1:11:10] revelation 1 by 13.
[1:11:13] when in the midst of the seven golden
[1:11:15] candlesticks
[1:11:17] miss means middle
[1:11:22] so if you're going to take your
[1:11:23] carnality of saying that only the first
[1:11:26] church age when you read out from an
[1:11:28] amiga
[1:11:31] the only the first church egg had him in
[1:11:33] the last church egg had him and
[1:11:34] the rest of them didn't have nothing
[1:11:37] they had enough to get in the body of
[1:11:38] christ
[1:11:44] see then i'll quote you the scripture
[1:11:46] and your prophet
[1:11:47] where he said he stood in the midst
[1:11:51] mist means so if you're gonna be carnal
[1:11:55] so will i
[1:11:57] if you're gonna say he was only in the
[1:11:59] first in the last age
[1:12:00] i'm gonna say that your prophet and the
[1:12:03] bible said that he was in the middle age
[1:12:05] greater than anything because he was in
[1:12:06] the midst in the middle
[1:12:08] i can be just as carnal as you can
[1:12:13] you see carnality is not a revelation
[1:12:18] it simply means that he's god of every
[1:12:20] age
[1:12:22] hebrews 13 8 we may change but god don't
[1:12:26] change
[1:12:28] when you come to the age of martin
[1:12:30] luther god was just as happy to be there
[1:12:33] in that message of the just shall live
[1:12:34] by faith
[1:12:37] as he is to be here today
[1:12:41] why can't we believe it that way
[1:12:46] see the word for each age was jesus
[1:12:48] christ
[1:12:52] just as the word of each prophet was
[1:12:54] jesus christ right
[1:12:57] so the word of each age is jesus christ
[1:12:59] the alpha and omega
[1:13:01] is dealing with the ministry of the lord
[1:13:04] jesus christ
[1:13:08] the ministry not the birth
[1:13:14] it's dealing with the ministry
[1:13:18] did he have his ministry back there and
[1:13:20] he'll have his ministry down here
[1:13:26] so when we're reading this quote don't
[1:13:28] get all tied up with it
[1:13:29] just ready for what he's saying look at
[1:13:32] him on masterpiece
[1:13:36] it's all others never appeared again now
[1:13:38] he's talking about the vision he saw the
[1:13:40] bride
[1:13:41] and how these others that come down with
[1:13:43] naked and things they went off and was
[1:13:45] destroyed
[1:13:48] they went out never to come back again
[1:13:52] but the bride came back because she's
[1:13:55] alpha and omega
[1:13:57] god the great sculpture has made him a
[1:13:59] masterpiece
[1:14:02] for the masterpiece and the son of god
[1:14:04] the masterpiece and the bride
[1:14:07] and it's a piece of him which must be
[1:14:09] the fulfilling of the word
[1:14:11] the word has been fulfilled and we're
[1:14:13] ready for the coming of the lord
[1:14:16] alpha and lumika
[1:14:22] what he was in the first church age he
[1:14:25] wants to be in the last
[1:14:28] now you better cover another point about
[1:14:29] for an omega whether you ever thought of
[1:14:31] it or not
[1:14:32] but as i said alpha and omega dealing
[1:14:34] with ministry you better deal with the
[1:14:36] ministry of jesus christ
[1:14:38] that he had while he was here on earth
[1:14:41] because brother branham
[1:14:43] come to bring back the other faith of
[1:14:44] the fathers but the faith of the fathers
[1:14:46] didn't bring the resurrection sign
[1:14:50] brother had the resurrection signed
[1:14:52] whether you believe it or not
[1:14:55] because you have to sign on the son of
[1:14:56] man right right that's resurrection sign
[1:15:02] you see brother around it looks like
[1:15:05] he's only placing it back in the first
[1:15:06] church age
[1:15:07] he's got to go back to there because
[1:15:10] that's true
[1:15:12] but the ministry of jesus christ when
[1:15:14] he's here on earth he's got to repeat
[1:15:16] here upon earth again we look at it and
[1:15:19] talk about brother branham
[1:15:22] but we better consider who we are right
[1:15:25] but i hope you're following me chapter 2
[1:15:28] chapter 3 is the word made flesh
[1:15:31] i'm trying to prove to you that by jesus
[1:15:34] coming to john
[1:15:35] it shows that the bride would be the
[1:15:38] word made flesh
[1:15:40] just like john saw the word make flesh
[1:15:44] all right let's see where's that
[1:15:50] it's number 17 of your notes which is
[1:15:52] the message e40 escape come hither
[1:15:55] be the last markings on your notes
[1:15:58] 1958-2222

[1:16:30] with him

[1:16:36] paragraph b 40. and if you see that the
[1:16:39] judgment of a god is so close at hand
[1:16:42] and remember at the judgment bar when i
[1:16:44] stand before you
[1:16:45] and you see that these things that i've
[1:16:48] said
[1:16:49] you don't have to wait till then
[1:16:53] are you listening to it hour by hour
[1:16:56] night by night jesus appears here
[1:17:00] in every form that he did
[1:17:04] outside of his corporal body
[1:17:08] when he walked on the earth
[1:17:14] he reveals the secrets of the heart he
[1:17:17] come down the other night before five
[1:17:19] do you only put it on him now listen
[1:17:20] let's keep reading
[1:17:22] he come down the other night before 500
[1:17:25] people right here
[1:17:27] just exactly the way it did on the day
[1:17:28] of pentecost
[1:17:30] now how many knows what happened on that
[1:17:31] pentecost a mighty rushing wind
[1:17:34] brother brown was standing there they
[1:17:36] saw his coat actually moving
[1:17:38] the mighty rushing wind come through
[1:17:40] this is when it was happening
[1:17:42] he's telling about it when a roar
[1:17:44] started from the skies
[1:17:46] and everybody started looking here it
[1:17:49] come like a great thunder
[1:17:50] struck up here on the platform and
[1:17:52] roared out over the building
[1:17:55] not a wind blowing but lacquer rushing
[1:17:58] me
[1:17:58] what did we do
[1:18:03] what did we do
[1:18:06] instead of our hearts being a fire
[1:18:11] to sit around the town you know what
[1:18:14] he's saying
[1:18:15] go down
[1:18:19] we said it was pretty good
[1:18:23] yeah no doubt in my mind about it
[1:18:29] the rising trendy lamps
[1:18:33] he said you got too much oil mixed up
[1:18:36] with your spirit
[1:18:37] or too much water you'll make carbon
[1:18:40] that was when the holy spirit came down
[1:18:43] and come across the building
[1:18:45] and brought around said it's like a
[1:18:46] rushing wind
[1:18:51] he said outside the corporate body he's
[1:18:53] here
[1:18:55] why can't we believe that
[1:18:59] why can't we believe just these little
[1:19:00] simple things
[1:19:03] look at number two three numbers
[1:19:09] the true bride this is spoken words

[1:19:18] virgin wound for the bride of the word
[1:19:22] which is christ when christ the word
[1:19:25] comes to the bride

[1:20:02] virgin continue to read
[1:20:06] did christ belong to a denomination did
[1:20:08] jehovah

[1:26:56] going to come through now
[1:26:58] the human wound or the bride

[1:27:05] the spoken word
[1:27:07] this to come through the womb
[1:27:10] the wound of the word it'd be good to
[1:27:13] read restoration of the bride tree and
[1:27:15] and spoken words original seed because
[1:27:17] look at restoration of the bride tree
[1:27:20] page 62. now once he was god's perfect
[1:27:24] prophet tree the example tree the
[1:27:26] bridegroom tree
[1:27:27] amen glory i'm going to say something
[1:27:30] directly
[1:27:31] if he is the bridegroom tree
[1:27:34] you believe it for the garden of eden
[1:27:37] then the bridegroom tree
[1:27:38] without the female don't bear fruit
[1:27:45] so he's got to have a bright tree
[1:27:48] she's got to be born by the same
[1:27:50] material
[1:27:52] the word made flesh from the tree i hope
[1:27:55] you get it
[1:27:56] the same life in this female tree the
[1:27:58] bride
[1:27:59] groom as it is in the bride the worst
[1:28:03] introducion you do
[1:28:04] is that right you say that ain't
[1:28:07] scriptural
[1:28:12] really
[1:28:16] in other words you say that ain't
[1:28:17] scriptural
[1:28:19] what that he's got to have a female tree
[1:28:25] you've got to have a bridegroom probably
[1:28:27] gonna have a bride
[1:28:31] you say that ain't scriptural well it is
[1:28:35] i caught that now see we're gonna have
[1:28:37] it going
[1:28:38] we're fixing to have our healing meeting
[1:28:40] in a minute i caught that
[1:28:42] he was you want proof of it
[1:28:45] he said i am the vine ye
[1:28:49] are the branches where's the fruit bar
[1:28:52] at
[1:28:54] amen least on the vine the virgin
[1:28:57] branches
[1:28:59] i am the vine you are the branches you
[1:29:01] brother fruit
[1:29:02] and the male tree and the female tree
[1:29:04] produces the pollen
[1:29:05] one to the other that brings the fruit
[1:29:07] and the brights and the vine does the
[1:29:09] same
[1:29:10] thing
[1:29:16] he made the choice to join himself to
[1:29:18] you and i
[1:29:22] thought he's got to be responsible it's
[1:29:25] like i told him last night in the
[1:29:27] in the bible study
[1:29:30] i said now that if choice told me
[1:29:32] something i can depend on that
[1:29:37] and you know i might not claim that for
[1:29:38] a long time
[1:29:40] but i still believe she'd do what she
[1:29:42] said
[1:29:44] but one day i could walk up there and
[1:29:45] say joyce
[1:29:47] you remember what you promised me
[1:29:49] because i believe she'd do it because i
[1:29:52] know where that way
[1:29:53] well why can't we believe god
[1:29:57] i want god obligated
[1:30:00] to me oh now boy you really went wrong
[1:30:09] hey we are obligated to him for
[1:30:14] everything we
[1:30:15] have breathe in the air you breathe
[1:30:19] don't get garbaged up in what i'm saying
[1:30:26] why don't i do like i do let me just
[1:30:28] tell you
[1:30:30] why do i pick up most of the meal
[1:30:32] tickets
[1:30:34] why do i buy a lot of things for a lot
[1:30:37] of people
[1:30:42] you know why
[1:30:47] i want you obligated to me
[1:30:55] i may wind up one day they don't have no
[1:31:00] money
[1:31:02] i may have to say danny i can't pay for
[1:31:03] it this time can you pay for the meal
[1:31:06] i know he would but because you know why
[1:31:09] because i paid for a lot of them
[1:31:13] i'd rather have you obligated to me than
[1:31:14] me obligated to you
[1:31:19] now god is obligated to believe you
[1:31:21] because
[1:31:22] of what he said
[1:31:26] that's the only obligation he's got to
[1:31:28] you and i
[1:31:30] he said if you can believe it brother
[1:31:32] brown said if you can find it in the
[1:31:34] bible
[1:31:35] you can call god on the scene and if he
[1:31:38] don't do it you can call him a liar now
[1:31:41] that's a direct quote from your prophet
[1:31:45] now that's not haphazardly i'll just
[1:31:47] there lord do that now
[1:31:50] be serious i never got serious with god
[1:31:54] and i didn't see him fulfilled
[1:31:56] he said well we need a lot of things i
[1:31:57] do but i try not to be that serious
[1:32:00] i try to be serious about this word
[1:32:02] first
[1:32:03] all right amen now this is our own
[1:32:06] opportunity
[1:32:08] he said you said that in scripture lisa
[1:32:10] i caught you
[1:32:14] you know that brother around said god is
[1:32:16] not complete without you
[1:32:18] may i record it maybe it said he said
[1:32:19] the guardian is not complete without you
[1:32:20] maybe that's the word
[1:32:24] look what he done you look down through
[1:32:27] the ages and you see they all mess up
[1:32:29] and you see the people you see luther in
[1:32:31] them with the trinity doctrine
[1:32:33] you see all of the things taking place
[1:32:34] smoking a pipe set in a beer
[1:32:36] you know i'm sitting in a pub drinking
[1:32:38] beer talking about the bible
[1:32:42] but he had a new birth well i don't see
[1:32:45] i can have it there and i can't do it
[1:32:47] now
[1:32:49] well why do you want to do it
[1:32:52] amen i mean are you wanting to drink and
[1:32:54] smoke
[1:32:57] no no i just don't understand how come i
[1:33:00] have to be different
[1:33:01] because you're in another age
[1:33:05] and the requirement of this age requires
[1:33:08] somebody to buy the bunt okay we'll get
[1:33:10] on
[1:33:12] no i'm gonna have to cut this off and do
[1:33:15] it later again
[1:33:17] but listen i want to make sure you get
[1:33:19] these things and then we'll
[1:33:21] we'll get on to the other so read feist
[1:33:23] with me all right
[1:33:26] number six feast of the trumpets 64 7-19
[1:33:30] and now how he said it'll appear the
[1:33:33] last days to bring the people back to
[1:33:34] the word
[1:33:36] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:33:38] know her make
[1:33:39] the revealed word what is your make the
[1:33:42] revealed word
[1:33:43] that's why this has to happen he wasn't
[1:33:45] in the reformers
[1:33:47] wasn't in luther wesley and the
[1:33:49] pentecostals in them the scripture said
[1:33:51] it wasn't
[1:33:52] but it will come that is his promise for
[1:33:55] this age
[1:33:58] now we're living the age that his coming
[1:34:01] will be
[1:34:02] she must be identified in him anyone who
[1:34:04] must be identified with her husband for
[1:34:06] the two or one
[1:34:07] and christ's bride has to be identified
[1:34:09] with him
[1:34:10] for the two are one and he is the word
[1:34:12] not the denomination word
[1:34:14] we are to be the children of the light
[1:34:16] of the light and the light
[1:34:18] is the word which is made light for this
[1:34:20] age
[1:34:22] how do we know light except it comes
[1:34:24] from the word all right
[1:34:26] the word make flesh is the light of the
[1:34:29] age when you see it
[1:34:31] the bible said so
[1:34:35] identified masterpiece
[1:34:38] you read all the rest of these
[1:34:41] because if you don't read them you don't
[1:34:43] care about it anyway
[1:34:45] i'm sorry you see we have to be
[1:34:50] the word made flesh in this age
[1:34:55] that was what was revealed to john on
[1:34:58] patents
[1:35:00] that the word
[1:35:03] would be flesh all right down through
[1:35:07] the ages
[1:35:09] it wasn't
[1:35:12] in its fullness
[1:35:16] well you're in the end time we're to
[1:35:17] come back to the same ministry
[1:35:19] that the lord jesus christ had
[1:35:23] we're to come back to be the word made
[1:35:26] flesh
[1:35:28] to us according to how we yield
[1:35:30] ourselves unto him
[1:35:35] we must be the word made flesh because
[1:35:37] that's what john saw in chapter two and
[1:35:40] three
[1:35:42] because remember chapter 4 was the
[1:35:44] rapture
[1:35:47] he saw an open door and the voices said
[1:35:49] come up
[1:35:52] there's not much written about the
[1:35:54] church
[1:35:57] but the thing of it is she's the word
[1:35:59] made flesh
[1:36:01] and how did it wind up to prove the
[1:36:04] point
[1:36:07] revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh
[1:36:10] i regret to sit with me in my throne
[1:36:14] now that's not the father's trump that's
[1:36:17] his throne
[1:36:18] listen even as i also overcame and
[1:36:22] sat down
[1:36:25] with my father in his throne
[1:36:29] as he and god was one he
[1:36:33] and the bride must be one
[1:36:36] the word made flesh what did john see
[1:36:40] the word made flesh
[1:36:43] what did the angel bring to john
[1:36:48] the word but jesus come to make it legal
[1:36:56] the angel come to join her to deliver
[1:36:59] the word yes
[1:37:00] but jesus come to make it live
[1:37:05] the prophet of god brought the message
[1:37:07] to you and i
[1:37:08] but the holy spirit has to come to make
[1:37:10] it live
[1:37:13] we must be the word made flesh
[1:37:19] in our flesh all right yeah
[1:37:22] let's don't see it see ours what are you
[1:37:25] looking for
[1:37:31] well what i want to see and i to see
[1:37:33] somebody stand up there and just call
[1:37:35] out like brother brown and call it out
[1:37:36] that was never a promise to me but to
[1:37:38] one man
[1:37:44] do you take your unbelief and whittle
[1:37:46] away all you want to
[1:37:50] but it won't stop god
[1:37:54] he's done showed in chapter two and
[1:37:56] three
[1:37:57] that they would be a bride that would be
[1:38:00] the word
[1:38:02] made flesh
[1:38:07] that's what you revealed he said we'll
[1:38:10] prove that okay
[1:38:11] chapter four verse one
[1:38:14] rapture takes place
[1:38:17] that's pretty good proof
[1:38:24] but you see we want to take our unbelief
[1:38:28] and our carnality and say i just don't
[1:38:31] see it
[1:38:32] all right evidently you don't if that's
[1:38:36] the way you think
[1:38:40] but do you mean nobody won't have it
[1:38:43] just cause you don't have it
[1:38:46] now better to be
[1:38:51] something for us to think about
[1:38:57] i i just don't believe in them fellows
[1:38:59] going down his face
[1:39:04] i just don't believe in that
[1:39:09] well now who are you for to decide this
[1:39:11] on
[1:39:16] i believe the word is made flesh
[1:39:21] well we're sure i'll agree
[1:39:26] but it's because of ourselves we are the
[1:39:29] ones who let the devil get on us
[1:39:32] and your prophet of god said we read
[1:39:34] this morning
[1:39:35] what keeps god the angels of god from
[1:39:37] coming to us
[1:39:39] we've got too many things in between us
[1:39:42] and him
[1:39:53] we're the one doing it and then we blame
[1:39:55] god
[1:39:57] then we get down and pray we say but
[1:39:59] lord
[1:40:04] why wouldn't you do this if we had run
[1:40:07] around here now
[1:40:08] he could tell us why
[1:40:12] did we have right around here today now
[1:40:14] he can tell us why
[1:40:18] as i said this morning or was it not
[1:40:20] started
[1:40:22] brother connie if you don't know what
[1:40:24] your problems are
[1:40:26] that's the biggest problem you've got
[1:40:31] you are your problem
[1:40:34] that's your biggest problem if you don't
[1:40:36] know your problems
[1:40:39] you know why because you're hiding
[1:40:42] you're trying to deceive everybody else
[1:40:45] you're being a hypocrite
[1:40:48] instead of just being straight
[1:40:52] been honest
[1:40:55] because it's a whole lot better to say i
[1:40:57] know what my problem is
[1:40:59] ain't gonna do nothing about it that's
[1:41:01] better than saying
[1:41:02] i don't know what my problem is brother
[1:41:05] dale i wish you'd tell me my problems
[1:41:12] no you don't want to know your brother
[1:41:19] because when you know your problems you
[1:41:20] got to do something about it
[1:41:26] does anybody in here want to argue that
[1:41:28] point
[1:41:30] will whoever the communion spend the
[1:41:32] rest of the evening
[1:41:38] your problem is you
[1:41:42] and then you want god to override
[1:41:46] no he won't override
[1:41:52] and you won't see what other people see
[1:41:57] because you won't follow the rules of
[1:41:59] the book
[1:42:03] you want me to call out and tell you
[1:42:05] what's wrong with you
[1:42:09] stand up sister johnny stand
[1:42:17] mr johnny now what your problem is
[1:42:22] you said i am
[1:42:28] see what you want me to do is go through
[1:42:29] your life
[1:42:31] and tell you what you've done this week
[1:42:40] see that wasn't what brother branham he
[1:42:42] said one of these days
[1:42:44] i'll show you this was not right
[1:42:48] is that the statements he made
[1:42:51] it was never to been used
[1:42:54] to reveal the secrets of the heart
[1:42:59] the secrets of the heart never converted
[1:43:08] anybody
[1:43:10] he said all these do and just bring you
[1:43:12] the presence
[1:43:13] to you to recognize the presence of god
[1:43:16] is here in other words i tell sister
[1:43:17] johnny something
[1:43:18] that she was thinking something she'd
[1:43:20] done this morning
[1:43:22] she said well god's got to be with the
[1:43:24] man
[1:43:27] now they're going to save her he said
[1:43:29] this gift ain't going to save nobody
[1:43:32] he said i'll show you sometimes it
[1:43:33] wasn't right
[1:43:35] the preaching of the gospel is what it
[1:43:37] is
[1:43:40] see because the preaching of the gospel
[1:43:42] will make the word flesh
[1:43:46] you want to know what's wrong with you
[1:43:47] go look in the mirror
[1:43:55] and did you say now lord i see my
[1:43:56] problem
[1:44:00] my problem is me
[1:44:05] dude that's why brother dale don't
[1:44:06] preach like other preachers
[1:44:08] because you see that makes it harder
[1:44:12] than to just tell you now george what
[1:44:14] you need to do i saw you dresses the
[1:44:16] other day
[1:44:17] it was up just a little bit too far you
[1:44:19] know a little bit this way
[1:44:20] that way do this do that the other
[1:44:24] she's got a mirror
[1:44:31] come on sisters you stand in front of a
[1:44:32] mirror and your knees are showing
[1:44:34] do i have to come along and tell you
[1:44:36] your knees are showing
[1:44:42] come on
[1:44:45] and we say where the word make flesh
[1:44:52] we're talking about the word made flesh
[1:44:54] and we want to talk about other things
[1:45:00] like one of these things you say well
[1:45:03] you could say a lot about this now the
[1:45:04] other
[1:45:05] sure can
[1:45:08] but if you don't know your problems
[1:45:17] wouldn't it be no good to tell you
[1:45:23] i mean that way say you know
[1:45:27] take out slipping around a little bit
[1:45:29] and
[1:45:31] smoking a little pot he comes to me and
[1:45:34] he said daddy
[1:45:35] tell me my troubles i said go look in
[1:45:37] the mirror
[1:45:44] he wanted me to tell him other things
[1:45:46] how sweet it is and how nice he is
[1:45:48] he ain't wanting me to tell him what it
[1:45:50] is
[1:45:51] you don't want me to tell you your
[1:45:53] problem
[1:45:57] because you'd have to agree that's right
[1:46:02] let's straighten up ourselves
[1:46:07] read the book and see what the book says
[1:46:11] right you know what i brother dale i
[1:46:13] want your word on what's right and wrong
[1:46:16] now you're trying to get me to be your
[1:46:18] crutch
[1:46:22] right i'm not going to be your crutch
[1:46:28] no i'm going to be your preacher
[1:46:33] we don't have to worry about crutches
[1:46:34] let's stand together
[1:46:37] let's go into the communion
[1:46:51] first corinthians 11 23
[1:46:56] forever received of the lord that which
[1:46:58] also i delivered unto you
[1:47:00] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:47:01] which he was betrayed to bread
[1:47:03] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:47:05] and said take heed this is my body which
[1:47:07] is broken for you
[1:47:09] it's doing remembrance of me after the
[1:47:11] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:47:13] had sucked saying this cup is the new
[1:47:15] testament
[1:47:16] in my blood this dude is off does he
[1:47:18] drink it in remembrance of me
[1:47:21] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:47:23] this cup you do shoe the lord's death
[1:47:25] till he come
[1:47:26] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:47:29] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:47:30] unworthily
[1:47:32] she'll be guilty of the body and blood
[1:47:33] of the lord but let a man examine
[1:47:35] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:47:37] and drink of that cup
[1:47:39] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:47:40] unworthily eateth and drink of damnation
[1:47:42] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:47:44] body
[1:47:45] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:47:47] among you in many sleep
[1:47:49] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:47:50] should not be judged
[1:47:52] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:47:54] of the lord that we should not be
[1:47:56] condemned with the world
[1:47:57] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:47:59] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:48:01] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:48:03] home that you come not together under
[1:48:05] condemnation
[1:48:06] and the rest will i sit in order when i
[1:48:09] come
[1:48:10] let's just take a moment and just think
[1:48:12] about it
[1:48:16] you know your troubles
[1:48:21] for me to tell you won't make you change
[1:48:28] a lot of divorces are coming and things
[1:48:30] because people won't
[1:48:31] look at the signs of their own lives and
[1:48:34] things
[1:48:43] we know ourselves i know my problems
[1:48:46] better than you do
[1:48:52] what bothers me wouldn't bother you at
[1:48:54] all
[1:48:56] but what bothers you wouldn't bother me
[1:48:58] maybe at all
[1:49:00] because we're different human mortals
[1:49:06] instead we have no excuse
[1:49:09] we stand openly before god because
[1:49:11] that's one thing
[1:49:13] that hebrews 4 12 says the word is
[1:49:16] sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:49:18] if the preaching of the gospel will not
[1:49:20] bring
[1:49:21] light to your eyes of the sins of your
[1:49:23] life
[1:49:24] then for me to tell you won't change
[1:49:31] as i was trying to bring out this
[1:49:32] morning of the angel of god
[1:49:36] you think about your angel
[1:49:41] he's a direct connection to the holy
[1:49:43] spirit
[1:49:45] there's cherubims there's seraphims to
[1:49:46] keep the worshiper clean
[1:49:49] direct connection
[1:49:53] and we we would want to hinder them
[1:50:01] remember we don't get by with anything
[1:50:04] all things are made known in this day
[1:50:08] you may hide it from me but you won't
[1:50:10] hide it from god
[1:50:14] i may hide from you but i can't hide
[1:50:16] from god
[1:50:19] take on these things
[1:50:23] think about the communion supposed to be
[1:50:26] the overcomer
[1:50:29] are we overcomers
[1:50:35] supposed to be for those that have
[1:50:37] wrestled it out and
[1:50:39] it comes forth are we overcomers
[1:50:44] take on these things father
[1:50:48] we thank you that you have
[1:50:52] given us your word
[1:50:55] and that your word is true now that we
[1:50:59] come to this time of the communion help
[1:51:01] us to
[1:51:02] realize realization and father
[1:51:06] we love you and we thank you
[1:51:10] it says that they take them a few
[1:51:12] moments and have just a moment of
[1:51:14] silence prayer
[1:51:16] praying one for the other you pray
[1:51:17] especially for me
[1:51:20] let's do this just for a few moments and
[1:51:23] just think about
[1:51:25] our lives and ourselves and our doings
[1:51:29] because we're not hiding from nobody
[1:51:34] let's just silently pray before god
[1:51:57] just bless each one of us lord as we go
[1:52:00] into this part of the service and just
[1:52:01] have your way
[1:52:03] forgive our sins and cleanse us make us
[1:52:05] worthy
[1:52:06] to be able to partake of this that's
[1:52:08] just an example
[1:52:10] but one day a reality will be more real
[1:52:12] than ever in our lives
[1:52:14] when we see you we love you and we thank
[1:52:17] you
[1:52:19] and just be with each one
[1:52:23] the bible said he took bread and he
[1:52:25] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:52:27] bread that's been made for this purpose
[1:52:29] this afternoon
[1:52:31] we pray that you would just sanctify the
[1:52:34] bread and the partakers that we may be
[1:52:36] one together in you we know that this
[1:52:39] bread is representative of the word
[1:52:42] and we believe your word so help us to
[1:52:44] as we eat this
[1:52:46] bread that we think about you that this
[1:52:48] is your body that was given for us
[1:52:50] because you was the word make flesh and
[1:52:53] we are the word made flesh when we let
[1:52:55] the spirit of god
[1:52:56] go through our beings we love you and we
[1:52:59] thank you
[1:53:00] sanctify the bread and the partakers in
[1:53:02] jesus name
[1:53:13] i always think about the children of
[1:53:15] israel
[1:53:16] when they were fixing to leave out of
[1:53:18] egypt
[1:53:20] a very sacred time to them
[1:53:23] very sincere time it was a very sincere
[1:53:27] time in the upper room when
[1:53:29] the lord jesus instituted the communion
[1:53:34] he was fixing to die his last act was to
[1:53:40] try to steal them
[1:53:44] that this was the fulfilling of the word
[1:53:47] this is what all of those days and
[1:53:50] feasts and times was all about
[1:54:02] lord you took the wine and you blessed
[1:54:04] it and you said take
[1:54:06] drink this is my body i mean my my
[1:54:09] spirit that was given
[1:54:10] to you for where that we could take it
[1:54:13] and drink it and
[1:54:14] let it be a quickening upon that word
[1:54:16] that we have ate today
[1:54:18] so let your holy spirit be with each one
[1:54:21] of us
[1:54:22] this is not your blood it's just it's
[1:54:25] just wine that was made for a purpose
[1:54:28] but it'll stimulate that bread that we
[1:54:30] do eat
[1:54:31] and it'll become blood vessels in our
[1:54:33] body
[1:54:34] lord how much greater is the revealed
[1:54:36] word help us to realize who you
[1:54:39] are and what you have made us
[1:54:43] you've made us the word made flesh again
[1:54:46] upon the earth
[1:54:47] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[1:54:49] name
[1:54:56] good morning i
[1:54:59] was by the river
[1:55:12] i'll carry my
[1:55:23] there's glory for me
[1:55:29] sometimes i'm despised
[1:55:33] and rejected
[1:55:37] and i questioned
[1:55:44] how then i
[1:55:46] take one more look
[1:55:50] at my calvary
[1:55:54] and it gives me the strength to
[1:56:12] rest me the ever
[1:56:15] green tree
[1:56:19] i'll carry my cross
[1:56:24] through the
[1:56:28] come morning dirt glory
[1:56:33] for me
[1:56:36] the church when we get over there the
[1:56:38] things will be gonna be a lot different
[1:56:40] we're gonna see reality as reality
[1:56:44] sure we have the human problems here of
[1:56:46] life we look for things and
[1:56:48] have our minds set on a certain thing
[1:56:50] that has maybe got to be
[1:56:53] before a rapture can come
[1:56:56] but you know i wonder what the disciples
[1:56:59] had their mind set on it certainly must
[1:57:03] not have been
[1:57:04] the way that it took place because it
[1:57:07] didn't
[1:57:08] do much good did it
[1:57:15] but he must have had it figured out
[1:57:16] wrong
[1:57:19] they didn't realize that jesus was going
[1:57:21] to have to die
[1:57:25] never dawned on them that that would be
[1:57:28] what would have to take place
[1:57:33] they thought maybe he was going to take
[1:57:36] over the world
[1:57:38] and even after his death and his
[1:57:40] resurrection
[1:57:42] they still thought he was going to
[1:57:43] restore the natural kingdom to israel
[1:57:48] they still didn't know what he's talking
[1:57:50] about
[1:57:52] see church do we have a reality
[1:57:57] let's all protect together
[1:58:06] you can be seated for a moment we're
[1:58:08] getting ready to
[1:58:10] have the foot washing if you'd like to
[1:58:12] turn over into
[1:58:15] john chapter 13 verse 2.
[1:58:19] and the supper being the end of the
[1:58:21] devil having now put in the heart of
[1:58:22] judas is carrick simon's son to betray
[1:58:24] him
[1:58:25] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:58:27] all things into his hands and that he
[1:58:28] was come from god and went to god
[1:58:31] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:58:33] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:58:34] himself
[1:58:36] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:58:38] and began to wash the disciples feeding
[1:58:40] to wipe them with the towel where with
[1:58:41] he was girding
[1:58:44] then come as he to simon peter and peter
[1:58:45] said unto him
[1:58:47] lord just i wash my feet and jesus
[1:58:50] answered and said unto him what i do
[1:58:52] that i know it's not
[1:58:53] now but i shall know hereafter
[1:58:56] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:58:58] wash my feet jesus answered him
[1:59:00] if i wasted not dies no part with me
[1:59:04] simon peter said unto him lord not my
[1:59:06] feet on me but also my hands and my head
[1:59:09] jesus says to him he that is worse
[1:59:12] needeth not saved towards his feet
[1:59:15] but he's clean ever with and you are
[1:59:17] clean but not all
[1:59:19] for he knew should betray him therefore
[1:59:21] said he you're not all clean
[1:59:23] so after he'd washed their feet and had
[1:59:25] taken his garments and was set down
[1:59:26] again he said unto them
[1:59:28] know you what i've done to you you call
[1:59:30] me master and lord and you say well for
[1:59:32] so i
[1:59:33] am if i then your lord and master have
[1:59:35] washed your feet
[1:59:36] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:59:38] things for i've given you an example
[1:59:40] that you should do as i have done to you
[1:59:43] verily verily i say indeed the servant
[1:59:45] is
[1:59:46] not greater than his lord neither he
[1:59:48] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:59:50] him
