7th I believe it is of august so remember that one you might turn back in your scriptures work term where we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and we've been reading from Romans 8 in Ephesians 1 true just keep these scriptures open and keep reading them and I hope you're doing your assignments of like listening to you know it's the rising of the Sun on going on into Easter seal um this list of the whole message that you're 65 and you'll see what we're trying to talk about but remember especially these that we're trying to give you a little bit ants to be able to get a better understanding okay visions one and Romans a our Heavenly Father we thank you for your love in your grace thank you for all things you said you gave them to us freely and we believe you we just ask you to help with some guidance tonight because Lord we want to say what you want us to say and we want to do what you want us to do we thank you for all the things that you have given us what you have revealed unto us Lord we pray that you would just open our understanding them of the scriptures that we may see the hour that we're living and be able to walk therein forgive our sins because we want to be covered by the blood and just have your way and keep each one of us Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus name these are one then we'll go Romans 8 that should be the garden father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him now where we were chosen we were chosen in him I mean he said well now I chose him no no we were chosen in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption unto the adoption of the children of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved let's go go to Romans 8 and 1 start with verse 5 we've read these sundays are and just mentioned a little bit I told you we'd come back to this but I want you two to get what you know get the point tonight or what we're talking about about the quickening spirit of Almighty God all right Fred verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but that but ye are not in the flesh and once but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwelling you I now if it dwells in you you're not after the flesh you're after the spirit all right now any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so you may be seated the way that is blessing to the reading of the word now we have been trying to give a place to to say what I wanted to about this part the night intro just pray that the Lord with helpless to be able to deliver what we're thinking on and i was listening hard the other day and especially sunday afternoon when waiver administering and Lord Stokely spoke to me about the scripture we've been reading diverter in Ephesians so you know maybe I need to keep preaching on while maybe he'll speak some more to me but we just keep going now we're trying to get a point across from what is our point we're not concerned about the change of the body sure we are because we want it to take place alright but I don't believe that it's an automatic process over just a day coming or a time or a bus pulled up you know and you go get in the bus and and all the way you go I've never believed it that way I believe it's got to be something coming from inside of you all right and in doing that so you coming from the inside then it's got to be that we recognize the word of the age that we're living and recognize what aids were living in recognizing an hour day in this message all right see that's what I've been trying to get to you didn't that's why I chose our Sunday morning to just read their Romans 8 in and show you that whole when you got over there speaking verse 23 to the eighth chapter you know to wit the redemption of the body to understand the read section of the body then he goes on to express to us you know the the thing that will take place that will cause us to come to that position and I've just made the announcement but I'm not gonna get on tonight I've just made an announcement and asking you and that way of a helpless when we read it is for you to look up translation on glorification glorified glory etc look those things up and when we get back to it will try to minister on that because see they asked the Prophet one time and this will show you kind of were that i will be going to but not neither to ask him and contact order and dr. they said what will that translation be you know the great translation he said just a journey now it was a simple matter to him and he expressed how that that would take place so you know that's why I've done like i did with with paula said nepal what is it that we must come to he says an understanding an understanding of the reduction of the body or i call how can i take place he said well first you know as we read here in verse 11 you know if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead be in you you'll also quicken you right now so he gave us the key to see him in brenham said only the predestinated will be quittin now he's talking about quickening power to those that are living not the quickening power to not the one great we'll have to receive all them go by the grape we'll have to receive a cooling up yes a brain for it but we're not dealing with that because we are alive people we shouldn't even consider the point of saying that well I guess all this have to go by the grain you know well you know what that's exactly where you go no that's exactly your confession and God makes a intercession upon our confession according to the scripture but if we confess that we're going to be changed then he can reveal that to us and bring it to pass you breathe in fine see them in doing that then Paul he says that those who he justified now that's not talking about just getting born again I tried to express that to you because he said there when you go over about Romans 1830 those who justified he has already glorified all right now see we we've got to come to a place to understand that you know the revealing of the word is the most important thing to us now not just our understanding of it open right did you remember that message I tried my best to to preach on it as good as I could that the disciples need our kin in the better gathered you know before the the holy ghost came and Jesus met among them and open their understanding of the scriptures but that did not give them any bird because John um could you know could say behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that didn't give him the new earth because Mary would say be it unto me according to that word I still didn't give her the new bird that's it she had to still go to penthouse to receive that he were in doing that then let's don't deal with this too fast that well you know I never seen that I remember one time we're sitting in the church and they were just rejoicing because a certain brother said we see there that's found in mark melesa John John 666 you know that was given the scripture you know John 666 to see that 666 everybody just rejoicing one we know I with wonderful I was fine but that didn't give me any rejoicing because that it always been that it had always been 666 they've never changed but see that with this the point would got contacted them what made them you know and like I've told you many times in you know when they found those lights 24 messages it you know of other randoms that hadn't been found what you know the people were just elated to find it and I was too because to hear the message but to them it was maybe we'll find something in there that'll change us it's like some kind of a deal that happens or you know the other is just well we're sitting back waiting we just waiting on the bus to pull up and then we'll pull up one day and will be gone yeah now I don't want to do that right I've always been one day wanted to to get out and go and especially to be early when I'm going and and all of that I wanted I want to get that first you know in winning brother Harris and I went to Jamaica years ago that it's my first airplane flight and I told him I said well first when I guess we'll go first class and Anya we're first class woods on an airplane it's that front I said whether the plane lands or fog I'll be the first one on the ground you know because that's not always you like to be up and going you know but now think about what we're trying to say all set those who he justified he's already glorified right now if we could just see that the if we if we could just see what he's trying to tell us we would stop trying to be a position of some way of attaining justification are some way of attaining to some secret coded way of finding a glorification that we can walk into or or whatever could take place we would stop that and we would start realizing that God's Word said what we are we don't have to get something else the Prophet didn't come to tell us anything else he come to tell us the works in who else alright see in doing that then we look at it and we see that what if I said Paul said in verse 11 how's this gonna take place if the spirit of gun being you doing it quick and Jesus up will quickly human come on simple matter simple point what is it new birth all right then what are we been trying to preach about the new birth that the day you receive the new earth what is easy to understand the soul to go through justification same case the baptism of the holy ghost in the plan of addiction it's easier to see the world from what the prophet has spoken to us that you know in the days of Noah was justified in the days of Jesus redman blood on it were sanctified and one day of good fiery baptism s'alright but now what about their bodies we live in you see the day that he gave you that new birth right there your body was redeemed you said but look at it we're getting older look what's taking place well fine look what Jesus took place and the Prophet said his body was redeemed our air jordan that's right and look what he went through me but then she don't get something like that that you're making it something that it cannot be make it be eat or what is do it and that's the point of tinnitus to yes to see that we've got to beat to this word amen yeah all right now quick them to the word of the hour we're not being quickened to the word of Luther's age Wesley's aids are the thick off the lady even though that's part of the story but it's not to just be quickened to those things it's not even to be quickened back to the book of Acts but is to be quickened to that age you were in and I'll get to in a minute we'll see the prophec signal son okay but see quicken all said it will quicken your mortal bodies now if I said and we look at it like the Bible says it then your bodies are already glorified that's what God says man we've got to get to the point to say what he says he said it's already over right when we get into trying to figure out the mechanical side of what anything is instead of just believing what is saying and then read the mechanical side right out of the Bible you know read the verses right out of the Bible and see it and see that's exactly what the Bible say Paul how are we going to be changing changing the moment wink overnight what's gonna take place Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the message me we know all of that well why are we looking for something instead of looking at what we're talking about me and seeing what God says about us see and that word quicken needs to be making life after death now gave you some quotes i probably won't use them I'll just pull it off with what it's on there to do it but you've got them where you can read them later but think about what it says quicken is to be make alive after death all right now according to Ephesians 1 to skew the seasons to one through five but this is read em I want to get this scripture in right here look at the theses to let's just get this into our understanding and we'll see what's taking place and we'll see the Bible is telling us not what has been not what will be the what we are right now all right so look at the scripture and you had any quicken who or what dead in trespasses and sin all right so quick it means to be made alive after you did so where were we were dead in trespasses us in we're in time past ye walked according to the course of this world we as human mortals me what lost just like the world was lost me according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience you know that same one was working in you and I we were thought was dead me among whom also we all and I got a big circle around we all at our conversation which manner of life and way of doings is what it's me in time spice in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh is waivers breaking out soon DC and of the mind I mean son dead nun and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as other oh no no I've always been oh yeah your love your stewardess lead to over brother Dale I've always be okay but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherein he look were in he with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're safe aren't nice quickness he's made us alive alright now he give us the new birth made us alive right now making us look at Colossians let's just get a few scripts look at Colossians 2 and you'll see it's the same as is Ephesians in the basis of what it's saying 2 and 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh had he quickened together with him having forgiven you all your trespasses I reel off just I don't won't give it to these I'll just tell you kind of worth the read but sometimes when you have an opportunity read songs especially 119 right all right you'll find that the psalmist David is asking the Lord a lot of times to quit in him one time is it quickly to your way one time he says quickened me to you word so he knew that he was dated and needed to be quickly are made alive time so is it now here look it on second Peter let's give me first Peter he's gives you scriptures name we'll get back on grip our point first Peter 317 use me that three and 17 by myself it must be second Peter 3 and 17b now he's talking about it the Jesus Christ was quicker oh yeah okay I'm just looking to first 17 where Christ also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the spirit and the flesh but quick under by the spirit he went to preach to the souls that were in prison hunter and quickening power that's why I asked you two to listen to the message or a reader of the it's the rising of the Sun because brother branham spends all of his time on that message covering the things of the quickening power C and covering it he covers it like this on page ten number two in your notes they gave it to you from Easter seal that we are quickly to eternal life right now we were quickly to eternal life because there's no need of talking about the body and it's redic shin until you see the soul and it's redic because it's got to work from the inside of it see because I said the Prophet citizen only the predestinated are considered in prediction are the only the predestinated are to be quickened the cause nobody else can't be you can't quickened you got to quicken the person from death to life before you can consider what even Paul is talking about it or you can understand anything we've got to come to the new verb and get into the new ver SI then we can see that not only now does that you birth quicken that soul and give you eternal life hmm it also now listen quickens Paul said your mortal body all right now you said what now we're still the same person after were born again so you would have said that if I hadn't come to that point that place is but it that's our thoughts uh-huh that's true we're the same person in body but when God came in to live in you and I by the new birth Paul carries it not on to the change you know that's wonderful and that'll be there but he carries it to the fact that we are already quickly and our mortal body limit well it's just getting older this is new everyone still having problems and still havin book see you're looking at the wrong thing you're looking at circumstances instead of looking at what God says then you understand why I've been trying to drive the point when you've got that new verb get quickened your soul to eternal life right all right that's easy to follow but since see we read in the scriptures that it quicken your mortal body why would you be sitting here tonight I'll just going to that part of it if God hadn't equipment you right you still be back in organized religion wouldn't you right right see he quickened us to this message that's the quickening power the Prophet we're talking about on the surrounding the Sun see he quickened us to the match to the hour what would we be if he had the quicken in the word that he had to made allowed to us the word we would still be sitting out there carrying the baptist bible Presbyterian Bolivar Pentecostal Bob or whatever you know believe in their doctrine if he had acquitted you so they were already started you remember I gave it to young on the future home we run around said you're growing on I'll give you that Treasury town you know then the epson who is this Melchizedek where he said it's already started so the day you receive the new birth that quickening power not only did it quicken the disciples right to the basis that they you know receive eternal life equipping their whole more of beings were at one time they were scared to go out me they were afraid to go out on that upper room but when that Holy Ghost game they go talking out of it she not only did equipment isn't prophetess said over and over is what equipment their tongues till have spoken languages other tongues and tons I gave you one in our brother and said look at fellow he said that quickening power was on him so much sit it hurting about 150 my home pick him up right they call that the quickening power me all right striking the body come on Phillip wedding body he just didn't going throw die hey man right he quickening some actually picked up his body right then we we talk about it you've been through things if you read those messages when you hear right around st. Martin says everything Elijah had died and they buried in you don't you know owns no rotten everything rotting away with nothing but dust man they're carrying a dead man long dead had a battle and they didn't want a Hummer couldn't run where clash with him so they just throw him over in the grave you know probably thinking we'll come back and get him you know in burien sometime he was dead they just throw him over in there we are what he laude probably outrun them right because see the quickening power and strutting dragging back alive what about a larger going to cross over there you know you get tired for the prophets it he just stepped over there you know structure the water at this party wall toward our vchera quitting them quickening power to pick him up or bad inna now listen I'm talking about quickening the bodies those in the Old Testament didn't have eternal life right in their soul right there were only a noise teeth right you see the quickening power striking them so much until great things would take place looking enum you just walked off here mine because that quickening power of Almighty God what about David I'll kill the line I killed a bear and that try to be insane if they right right why the coating you were a standing right d he could feel the power of God the anointing upon him what about Samson see even doing well they're being a blind man having to be laying around when you reach back and caught hold in locks he found out that hair was growing they just made a mistake oh they thought well he's blind to eat no no good like this the hair grow back out with that quickening power so strong on him until he just recent after building this food at name quickening power what about the 300 children come into the fiery furnace a bed so much quickening power tool only thing got burned with the things that take to hide your hands with pictured something talking about on the body man hey we are quicken to eternal life by the new birth David Nepal is not covering that in the Romans of what we're saying he's trying to explain to give an understanding that he had to us out there to wit the redemption of the body in other words how short a place and he takes place by the Spirit of God is dwelling within you and then we must come to a place to see the dog who he home yeah mm no see many a call but your children but the few chosen is what Paul's talking about right not too many this column he told like to feel their joke he comes with children in him I see then Paul goes owners are set to trying then that in that new birth me will come something that will bring us to a place of an understanding that if we're justified then we're already glorified we're already good at that but can we say what God's sake that's hard to do some time right you r avensis it to you couldn't really even hardly say the words I'm healed which are then people say no no not brother to him I don't want to say I'm healed because I'm not healed and I'd be lying what forget it then because you're right you're lying you but you're aligned when you don't say what God said because God says you're healed they said to brother Brown should run around you told em people her heel he said I told her what to buy you said back at this year thus saith the Lord you'll be reading right out of the safe the Lord by straps your heel because the thing we got to do is what put our sales dire right see then Paul is not talking about just the quickening of the newer and brother branham is not talking about just the quickening of the new birth he covers that in this arrived in the Sun Easter sealed and all of those message related he's talking about the quickening of this body right as I said a moment ago then look where you've been look where you came from what brought you from there to here well I just got fed up with that mess it up and I seen it it's kind of Lux brother said it but rent oldest person said you had to fight your way all the way to Jefferson Building so the brother went to him and asked him he said what happened he differed he's not got in the car and drove up back let's see for the rest if you had to fight your way all the way there's no telling what went on in the way of trying to stop him but he just didn't realize that he's one right knee quickening power quickening power to quicken the moral right the week and father will talk about the eternal life we're talking about we've got eternal life because see if we talked about having a lot then we're taking over hey I've got it made you know if I die I'm still all right I've got my cuz i got eternal lot and that's fine but you know somebody you're not gonna be able to have to undo like that we can't honky doing that way somebody's gotta say i'm already regained right somebody's got to say I'm already changed before God can make it come to pass right and it don't take but one person come on now you know what that's all they took in the days a week alright for heinous to fulfill all of the Bible he just walked off the earth huh she didn't we ought to be to the basis of trying to to say listen he's already quicken these mortal bodies now if you read the notes I get in there you'll hear the prophet saying like this specially who's this Mel Chesney he said we used to be in sin I get you know I get kind of ticked off at all of us I said all of us we spend more time talking about how sinful we was and what we come from then talking about the God that brought us from there no we want to glorify more the flesh than we do that the God that saved us you I think it's time to get away from that and get onto the basis that that we see God in His reveal word hmm and follow that to see the quickening power is to quicken these mortal body you remember when you used to live for the devil right maybe not big there's some among us that probably never went out and drank tour smolder are our committed adultery our are all kind of thing nice yeah I'll tell you this good money and its really good one with the to Bible study the other day and the topic came up and and they came up about the kiss being potential adult or something came up like that and I said well I can't raise my hand to say I never kissed nobody until I married you know we know we got a couple set among the suppressor name that they've never kissed nobody that's but their part they're younger partner right the day they got married was the first kiss thing at that Bobby Monica shake hands with him praise God for me you know what that means kids at means you can do it that means you don't have to view it on that stat right amen I thank God I rejoiced when they said that because see that's a right funny I can't say it and take him but listen quickening us from the things we used to do and you know when we were in cm we followed sin right we done like everybody else and I said maybe not on the biggest degree I never did drink cuz I didn't want to me I just didn't want to but that see that didn't make me a better person it just made me one that I didn't have to you know I can tell you that you don't have to believe I hall people in my own car take them over to get the beards doesn't bring back set amount still one drink because I just didn't want to what you see my point is kids you don't have to do that what I've heard all the risky i'll talk about you have to learn the Life Drain dear why do you want drank something it don't taste right the first time if I gotta learn a lot in the dragon I don't get me some water but listen think about the night you think about where you came from no think about in your life what you came from think of the situation's of life and how lost you work you don't have a problem doing that booty I don't have any problem thinking about what he used to do do you well think about it in me you see God saved you from that when he gave you the new birth eat quick on that mortal body in it made you quit you don't do those things anymore and I'm going to follow you on tumblr what's he bringing them up a little higher right now why do you claim the new birth I don't cuz i'm receiving you birthday for coming in to mention but a lot of you climb the new birth back before then and i agree with it and it's fine hun all right but you remember when you had the new verb that the churches you were in didn't teach against things right come on sisters you cut your hair painted your face now i'm giving you the out of it to say that you were ignorant of the truth and you tell me you receive the Holy Ghost back better that's fine I believe we my point is this because listen to I'm sayin see you done no signs because you were ignorant to the truth and it was not talk to you that it was wrong to do that till you were not done it men and women both all of them but you see when you come in with this message did this message become a book a room that we had to stop them touch did it become a book of rules and we had to quit doing things or is it the opening of the word that quickened our mortal bodies amen see we're going we want to wait quick and over there until it's finally changed it won't be changed if it's not quick an eye on right I gave you that free quotes and I would run around city that that Holy Spirit quickened us to the word we come suits under subjection to the word Griffin to the word that when we heard it maybe sometimes we quit because somebody told us you were to see me it was my family car I had a beautiful 1956 bill our sports coupe scoot chevrolet no one you know I I had it hand-painted and we've done everything to it but it was my car I didn't figure out what the hippie but the first church i went to then there comes that hippie driving his over his fancy little car what you know what I sold it maybe I wasn't a legalistic phone but I didn't want him to keep talking about my fancy little you know hippie car you know young person in his little car he was my family cars all that I could afford I finally sold it not me a big o 88 oldsmobile four-door well you know they did quit talking about my hippie car me would you understand what I'm getting at maybe sometimes we put a lot of things before it's revealed to us right I remember mr. Tatum and somebody kid we were who the other person was but they were talking about you know they had to dress this right and everything because there was a certain brother said he's coming through and said he'll preach against it you know he said we'd but her dress ride tonight because he'd go preach against it well I was alright that was commendable and respectable you know but see have we been quickened to the word are easy to book a room as our understanding been open as to what men and women should be and look like and and live like an act like right is it just opened our understanding or is it a revelation in our heart which one is good now you know yourself what I'm fixin safe right did you seen a lot of people's Wars it would reveal to them about how to live what to do not to do that sign people back sleeve and they went back to doing those things but now that was no revelation wouldn't a revelation now if it was revelation they wouldn't went back doing in the rocky bad food if there's a revelation and when to back slid him not as far as easily but you know it's true yeah the people that preached a lot of things out of our home when I was coming into the message there in 66 and 66 67 and on him a lot of things it was preached against that people turn around rattling right back to it and even worse let's get up making a difference like I said maybe sometimes we just quit things on our own you ever heard Brett already set like this he said now your sisters cause you got along her long dresses he said don't think that that makes you a Christian little bird so evidently he must have note somebody must know that a lot of them had that for a reason or other than the fact of being converted but get the point what I'm saying even after becoming Christians the opening of the word this what quickens this right we're looking at it as an anointing of the Spirit to come down see quickening someone more till the spirit to come down the upon us when I thought it was supposed to be from the inside I thought its what i was trying to get across to you very heavy sunday that it spoke to me from the inside me and that's the only way the change will ever come the plenty of people preaches it one day that's anointing going to fall and it's going to change us everybody rejoice glory hallelujah from one day course if you lay em down on it and like I said about somebody say old the Lord's coming in you say yep real close now this is the Nelson but now nobody knows are there summer but maybe 50 years from now because they're thinking they're gonna be dead well is that the way the people are the man's me screaming and hollering and can do it you know know about things and then see the way they turn I remember when we went up to a certain brother's place and was having a minister's meeting guard we walked into his house brother dick had come from a place to word it took the pastor was pretty strong against Christmas trees and he walked in an hour set one in the brothers house all decorated and he looked at me and he said brother so much I'd like to be here me but you know what it's like I told him I know brother sewing stuff same one I said you let them do babies come along oh they got all man they swore he would never do that I said you let them babies come along well when the wife got pregnant first thing it was now i'm not gonna say nothing this year next year anyone I'm not throwing off home buddy because what is for that might be a small little playing me trying to get my two fingers you know compared to apply of you and I talking right knee I'm just talking about what the Prophet said much about will take back the Bible didn't say it would just quicken the show and then we give us a new body no the same man that tells us about the quickening of the soul says it why we are mortal mortal you know right in these elements we're living in that we can be quickened are made alive and don't have to live like that anymore but is it just a quote and we say we as we drank all the liquor we want to we smoke all we want to we didn't it is that just a quote of some kind or is that some kind of a hot tub situation to try to encourage other people are discouraged or the beam or something is it real right quick and our mortal bodies did you think that's easy to look just keep looking out there and so when a under it so much under so much other one day I'll get out there one day I'll reach it you know like the the carrot in front of don't keeps pulling the love you but the Bible doesn't talk about that Paul didn't speak like head news brother Brandon Paul said we're already glorified Paul said we was chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's right and they were already justified and we're already glorified I'm looking something brother Brennan said today he said you know another word funny part razor cutter can't remember exact wording but he was saying it like this if we were justified glorified before the world and that's according to the Bible and according to him then we didn't have anything do it didn't he jump but wait a minute at four no she looked down through your frigate no you ain't listening if God glorified you before the world ever begun it could not be on the place is what you do or don't do because at that time you hadn't done it oh that right will foundational world you had done it so it couldn't be this based on together on what we call for knowledge for knowledge is the for knowledge or what will transpire d predestinated according to his word when I finished on predestination that is I got a little bit on something I don't move off of it because Satan get on our way people don't understand that I've tried to explain that to ministers that's what you see these doctors appear from but if you'll go along jump up with that get on something else get it fit around good night while you come back and you just get in it go a little bit that way Satan can't keep up with now you wouldn't understand the excellent maybe I don't need to say it but it's just a way to do I dropped off a predestination got over onto another topic and going on a little bit now but listen church he quickened us to the truth right he quickened us to this message right as I said most of you claim the new burger a lot of you claim that you were before you come into the message right and that can be you when he quickened Jeep to the message man that's right hmm they were sister Gayle her statement would don't tell me I will be responsible can you see that was our day that was our time I don't have to be responsible if I don't know it so don't tell me what you see we've been quickly we came out of organized religion huh because we were quickened that's right quickened by the word to see that it was wrong we love the people but we don't love the doctrines anymore huh that we were quickly to the word and we don't love what we used to love no more than we love the sin that we used to see them I hope you understand my point see when we come into message we didn't jump in this message and even the day you come into mesh and receive the Holy Ghost and everything lined up that's what people think they're you know they don't want to talk to me because my memory at 71 years old it's feel too good this old boy when I first heard it at its line right up when I thought Lord God help me because it's taken me 40 years to try to get lined up well you're just slow well I'm talking about those that said they died in just a minute because they're with me too I can remember all of it I'm trying to talk to people about things they were doing it wasn't right according to the Bible but you see when we get over on the other side it's easy to say you know but I just lined up immediately no the quickening power comes on a gradual basis as to the word because it's when the word is revealed now it's the quickening power it is not when you read it it is not when you even agree with it right lorenz that people will sympathize with the message yeah you know what sympathize with it is nowhere to go along with it but did this won't step on over into it see the quickening power where are you at tonight my in Luna Georgia me what brought you here what keeps you here is it just a place to go to church there's a lot of a whole lot closer to you film I want to believe it's a quickening power Nick quickens us to the word that we here and then we get hungry because we you're more that's what's wrong with the people of the message right no it's a bad illustration but I've always tried to tell you you know you if you're feeding an old calendar Jordan Rachel Rachel special get anyways gets back cuz you know she told me put so much thing into feeding her chickens and rabbits and dogs well they're gonna be without food when they get back good I thank you hungry I for the last three thank you Wow because that's the way I am in the gospel but I've told you don't story about you know you got a cow she's getting one bale of hay and that's all she's gotten 20 years later she's still eatin one bill honey well something happens the truck and father bear father office you get too available boy she swings he loves she's getting fat and she's hit and that's what people are that's why they don't want to come around Lucy they don't want them to hear the word that comes from Lulu because the afraid that they're gonna get taste of two bales of hay and that won't come do it at night and but i think it's the quickening power that brought us all together right right right i think it's the quickening power of this going to put the bride in the rapture and we're not talking about those who go by the grave they are waiting on us to come to the place that that file quickening power cuz i was looking for that dressing one day God willing on a church hmm he said she'll do in one year what the I'll just try to do in two thousand but said she doing it now see we don't want to quote that just what I'm trying to tell you the day you got the new earth that quickening power started tweeting that body it's just been quickness to stop sinning it quickens us to the message that's right its greatness to the reveal word as we walk in the message yeah that's right and it makes us hungry for more word that's right the quickening power probably see it I gave you one quote in our research shoot it burn it do anything you want to he says you can't destroy it dad there's no way to destroy the quickening power but you see what I'm talking about we're looking at a quickening power like it's something that's got to be some anointing to come down what is your profit say the anointing is supreme power in control that's right nah Jesus locks into the temple one day takes the Bible stands up and read this day this scripture is fulfilled goes over and set down no running screaming hollering no greater than wanting to light shining flashing right the greatest anointing that had ever been in the world was sitting that the most quickening power that this world had ever seen was sitting in that seat and who understood that that was what was going on I believe in it I'm looking forward to it the profits in one of these days there will be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll come from heaven distracting this bride little file fill every fiber of our of our meeting and we'll go in the rats right I'm looking for that but if we're not lined up with the quickening power to become a Christian to begin a widow sin of our daily lives and walking like the only things we didn't understand if it's didn't quickness to the message and brought us to the basis of the word that this message is the important thing in our lives because in this message is the change of the body what I'm trying to get you see Paul was telling us about the change he was telling us if we could just realize were justified and see really what God is talking about a justification you remember I told you read invisible Union you hear the Prophet explaining it he's explaining justification but he's explained it in three stages stage one you get justified chops occupy sins stage to you come to a place that it says though you never done it stage three he says the real you never did too now how much can we do and talk about as I said a moment ago other things that we've done in life will you realize that God shall justify that until he showed you one day that you fear from that then you begin to open up the world and to us to show us fit you know we done it but God has put it in the seal forgetfulness never to be remembered against us what you see then it comes to a stage of seeing the real you never to do what is the real you for the great that's soul that's within you that come from God just a real youth that's right right okay well you know if that show come from God is come and dwell in this body then I'm not going to get another body he laid claim on this one and he's going to work away and maybe that's not a good term of doing but he's going to make away that I can walk into that place the glorification can be here upon this earth could we're going to be changed here the Prophet said we cannot did you hear him in the quick do its rise to the Sun for shirts in that he said we can't meet God in these bodies he said these bodies are sin but now what's he saying their product of sin he said we're gonna have to have that new body to meet him in the air not another body this body make new and go meet him in the air so then we got to be dealing with the changes being here don't think you've changed you going up in the air somewhere and you're gonna start out you know fat and ugly no no then we're going to go out so far we're just going to start fading down do we get to the 1820 and on then we're gonna be yep my looking young you know I way that's what happened at Ground Zero I've told you what I thought I believe Abraham woke up one morning and he looked over there and he said I'm in bad shape cuz I feel young more laying over here and I'm an old man what did i do last night I dropped it I get then you look this Sam is that you she looks gorgeous Abraham is that you i believe it was done so quick until they didn't know anything about if you get on it's nothing to be something that you just keep on going you finally get this way you know the way i think a lot of people thought somebody turn left it starts with the good works its way out through this way not this way cuz they know the prophet said it comes me inside out but i don't think that away i don't think you were that right I think it's the word reveal to you have it if I don't get nothing to use enough to get one time this word made alive it's the quickening power that I'm talking about Abbott we have the dynamic I mean the mechanics in the basis of the word showdown in our heart yet but we need to make the dynamics for that word that we have sold down in our heart I agree we young man I know that that's what we're having we need to quickening to do that but it won't be done just at one time right it's on the gradual basis God doesn't we case we couldn't stand it and what would be wonderful wouldn't it to be sitting somewhere god that's open the entire Bible that we can see everything I would be wonderful but he can't do that human mind couldn't comprehend it couldn't stand it so it does real slow and gradual sure he's open our understanding we talk about we understand one God we understand water baptism we understand no eternal hell we understand marriage and divorce we can quote quote quote quote quote but how much of that has been revealed right yeah how much is that Ben Revere can we handle like the Prophet would say then yeah here comes to former rain the teaching of the word he said then the latter rain falls to quicken that then one day he turns around he followed that line of thinking all the way you know former rain didn't latter rain former rained in later on then one day he said it like this he said here comes the latter rain with a former rain on it I don't understand what you're saying very simple what we received the night tomorrow what we received the quickening power of the understanding of the word tonight tomorrow is another day it becomes a form of rain so I'm giving you some form of rain are you listening the next match of yourself some form a rain look up what it means by glorification look up what it means glorified I don't want you to raise your hands II haven't have you done it but look at it you might find out the profit is right when he says what is this great translation most important question or doubt that anyone could ever let me put this way the most important question that I can ever find in the message anywhere did anybody ask you now I'm not the wealth only other questions but that was to me was a seal sign definite question come from a person it really wanted to and he suggested check just to check did he explains it all how do we get this understanding of the reduction in the body it's just a chain if the spirit that was in him being you it will quicken your mortal body they will turn you from sin I told you this I didn't get in all that because you can just take and read it read down through there the matter of fact the v8's chapter read a very therefore now no condemnation till they walk not after placement that's the spirit no coming down read on it's dealing with flesh and Paul comes to a basis there in Romans about six or somewhere in there these are the things i would i do not the things i do i would not you know get all laughing me he was simply explaining that the outside man was wanting to fly after the law of the flesh but the inside man was wanting the fire after the law of the spirit and he had a war continually that's right is that not where we read and that is there not a war in your life come on is there not a war in your life that's going home I told you that was so much talk then until the badges touted that Paul was born again he was trying to explain it over Oh his already born again he's explaining what we do pulse it then with the law of god I serve the inner man but he said with the law of the flesh he wouldn't say it he automatically yielded to the flesh no he was saying that we are automatically in the flesh and our following after the flesh the Bible says we need to mortify the deeds of the body is that right make tonight the deeds of the body to bring ourselves under subjection you mean we're going to get to a place when he Dave and I'm going to have any trouble no I'm sorry I never have agreed that we wouldn't agree that we would get to place it you know no we're human but we've got to get to a place to find out that is he that has chosen other stuff and that he's living in us and we have an advocate with the father or why would we need an advocate if we didn't do wrong my life 81 number other day you get me all confused now you've born that way I just expose your confusion take on these times me nothing Satan can do to take away from you what God's revealing that you can walk on what God is revealed to you Ava fill it did right you did right Elijah did quickening power does this say that I'll say it one more time with all that noise what people think about they think of quickening is some rushing mighty wind that drop down out of heaven David probably looked after when he was talking to Saul and you know what he put it on he's the day was a bear come after a one of my sheep and he said I rose up and killed it he said they was a line come in one day he said I just rose up and killed he said so will it be with that fist see he had no fear could I believe David was like this let me walk out there and face the time even if he kills me due to human mortal thinking bro he said when I barrel run out her naturally old blue secures the bear Milan's glad I was a little afraid of it I'm sure I realize that feller whole lot bigger at night but said if I'm called of God ain't nothing gonna get mom he had been anointed to be keen right right right and there was nothing could killed a guy until he settlement that's right he was not afraid of anything folks the new birth the things that I've talked about the night coming into the message to receiving the opening of our understanding of the word of God to me out sitting our parade while ago what I'm gone if I miss it I'm happy I've seen what the prophets desire to look in to be happy about it yeah we're so down and out know at least these quick at me of that much right how much it we quicken folks because the quickening power i'm talking about it is how much word has been revealed not how much shouting glory hallelujah someone had come down another class and i believe in every bit of it you can't take away from me the things that I've seen and I've talked to you about it over the years do you know that I believe in the anointing I believe in see anything I believe in personal things but yet all that can be imitated but Satan cannot bring the word word by word that's what I depend on the quickening of the word is the quickening power than I desire go to me that's the dynamics to the mechanics do you have a lot of word late in you don't realize I've always said I love to how reveal what's in my head the knowledge that I have for the message I left her to be revealed but you know he revealed as I have neither quickening power to quicken us from centers to Saints and that begin to work and the Prophet remember who is it smell charity it's already started this body is going to be reading it's already started the quickening power is already working within it to bring it to the right place walk in the word and the seed and isn't having the Prophet said he said walk in the word and watch it unfold the quickening powered up mr. home uses the quickening power it's already started they're at that's what I'm trying to tell you you see if I just to see anything if I just seen anything if I could see this the quickening power what else do you want already here the brain is that place what you preach I got there were in my fruit tree stand Oh in other words I felt Pig to kill up to Masada here fella when I turn and I sing I seen some bad you just stay right here outside eee each army you come page to page I see so every year the quickening power if it just quick way to probably say if God would just let me use it magnitude of God with quicken our understanding he said there's angels in this room right right you think that something happens and maybe you you think well I was really good Jeffrey in him they had a little incident one day I with the water on the road and it was the truck was were switching from side to side if they'd been anybody there they would you know you know who was that why don't we thank him for what we see he's trying to get us to recognize that he's here with us some people he opens her understanding enough to see it but you know what the Prophet said and I don't to make everybody in the building rejoice right I believe it I see that's really not believe it the quickening power to quicken us from dead mortal human beings to alive Christians that are living in bodies is going to be changed but it's already done as far as God is concerned right we just got to get whatever God says about it but what he says how can you say as far as he's concerned we got to get as far as he's concerned in us and honestly don't to make did we get as far as he's concerned in the side of us then you know it whips it like he sees will see angels will see beings then why because we believe in it we believe in the supernatural anybody believes a supernatural has to bleed you can see we've won 37 straight big one connection be play he might have a neat but i believe that shine God is here would you be pretty are in I Oh Oh the I Ching Oh wait the house if I hurry Mimi and over Oh he was yo yeah it around life me Oh Oh Oh you Oh Oh ah Oh take off my airplane you wall a ue wonderful here Oh Oh No most of you noted and watch been having trouble for about eight or nine months Matt hurting in her side and into her back in things you know she's going to the doctors and I'm in checking out things and she had to go there the other day for an injection into the spine to find out to talk to write up some things and you know and she said when we were there in the car she said just pray farming you know this will be all right we see you know how I am we thank god for doctors we go through we do like they tell us outside of when it becomes wrong or harmful we do what they tell us to do that when we know and realize that a lot of time we've get harm out of things because they are practicing medicine they just but you know what I asked us is Lord and you know what I've got inside my who got to learn the medicine cabinet never told you plaintiff I the medicine you take ask God to take the medicine that you're taking and it don't matter if they give you the wrong medication God will make it right because these he's gone if you believe it so I just pray to shuffle with brightness ignored you know we believe you but just you use the doctor let his work I would maybe we know who the healer is well she'll tell you in a hurried painting she's been in for eight villages not all totally gone no but it's a lot better what I God we're not bragging about the doctors we're bragging about God cuz he's the one who takes care of everyone pray and ask God to say Lord let this work my brother Tom said dirt on ice and we're going along with your program what then you get in there you will find nothing well when they got in there they didn't find anything well that was wonderful Evan but he still said we're going long Lea program thank God for any way that heals people swear and play biotechnol medicine but you let them get sick and heard enough and he'll take pain pills and everything else but not throwing off on the way it's being honest and straight do we know who the hero but around said God knew that we would need that in this life days because of the heart problems you know of your heart in that little natural bristle until he said God allowed them to bring that two pice because he knew we would need he's even though he was a prophet why didn't he say well now bless God now maybe you're not gonna go no doctor and get that growth taken out they were going to get it taken out God came on to see my god but the point is he's on his way why can't we believe in healing believe the doctors believing that thank God far yeah st. get away from our super duper faith to getting down to just believe in God that's the way i get my healing it's just saying gone I believe you your word says it let us know mum say anything else contrary good but your word says it and then believing it what about it bike on these times you might have should have an equilibrium that is prescriptions enough just this right father we send assure our own once the first song when this fascism No yup Oh Oh Oh ha Oh how much in Dublin revelation my review oh very ish we love cover
