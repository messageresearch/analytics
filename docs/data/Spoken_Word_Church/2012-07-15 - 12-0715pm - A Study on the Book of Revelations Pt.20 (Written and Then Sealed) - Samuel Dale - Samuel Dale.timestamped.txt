[28:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[28:51] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[28:53] things which must shortly come to pass
[28:56] and he said and signified it by his
[28:58] Angel and to his servant John who by
[29:01] record of the word of God and of the
[29:02] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[29:05] things that he saw
[29:06] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[29:09] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[29:12] watching that keep those things which
[29:14] are written therein for the time is at
[29:18] hand all right now we'll go over to
[29:21] first Peter
[29:23] one and nine receiving the end of your
[29:25] faith even the salvation of your souls
[29:28] of which salvation and Prophets have
[29:30] inquired and searched diligently who
[29:32] prophesy out of the grace that should
[29:34] come unto you
[29:35] search in what or what manner of time
[29:37] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[29:40] did signify when it testified beforehand
[29:43] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[29:45] that should follow unto whom it was
[29:48] revealed that not unto themselves but
[29:50] unto us they administer the things which
[29:53] are now reported unto you by them that
[29:56] have preached the gospel unto you by the
[29:58] Holy Ghost sit down from heaven which
[30:01] things the Angels desire to look into
[30:03] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[30:06] be sober and hope to the end for the
[30:09] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[30:11] the revelation of Jesus Christ you may
[30:15] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[30:18] the reading of the word
[30:23] trying to speak on
[30:24] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[30:27] because that's what the whole book is
[30:29] we're speaking on your book
[30:31] and trying to you know bring some things
[30:34] out and get some understanding
[30:37] opponent and uh
[30:40] now we we spent some time this past uh
[30:45] Wednesday night talking about kinsman
[30:48] redeemer and we didn't finish that we
[30:51] just brought it up into a point to put
[30:54] your minds to thinking and we will get
[30:57] to that later more of the kingsman the
[30:59] Redeemer and talk about that but what
[31:03] are we saying now we went through
[31:04] chapter four you know
[31:06] you know four chapter of Revelations and
[31:08] saw all of the things and the symbols
[31:11] and the understandings and the things
[31:13] and then uh we have come now to the
[31:16] fifth chapter
[31:17] and uh dealing then with this fifth
[31:20] chapter we uh are trying to look and see
[31:24] more about where we're at and what we're
[31:26] doing so if you will brother go ahead
[31:29] and pull up the revelations 5 and we'll
[31:31] read that
[31:33] we want to speak on more on it but it's
[31:38] just something struck me and I've I've
[31:40] got to try to cover this to be able to
[31:41] get on to another
[31:44] but in Revelations 5 1 it says and I saw
[31:47] in the right hand of him that said on my
[31:48] Throne a book written within and on the
[31:50] backside sealed with Seven Seals right
[31:54] and then you go through a strong Angel
[31:56] proclaiming and and the different things
[31:58] but the main part is to get to where it
[32:01] says in one of the elders verse 5 saith
[32:03] unto me weep not
[32:05] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[32:07] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[32:09] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[32:11] thereof now
[32:14] I don't know
[32:17] we talk about this past Wednesday you
[32:20] know that the
[32:21] that there was a throne
[32:24] when sitting on the Drone
[32:26] and then there was a book in the right
[32:28] hand of the one that was sitting upon
[32:30] the throne
[32:31] and we covered giving brother Branham a
[32:34] paragraph
[32:35] 116-118 of the breach I wish you would
[32:38] read the breach over and over
[32:41] you know and and look at it and see what
[32:44] he's talking about and read if you get a
[32:47] change or listen to the tape of
[32:48] Revelations chapter 4 and chapter 5
[32:51] preached back about 61.
[32:54] and and it would really help you to
[32:55] understand the things I'm trying to
[32:57] bring out
[32:59] but we saw that that book in the hand of
[33:02] the one sitting on the throne
[33:04] was the abstract titled deed to eternal
[33:08] life and the Earth and all of the things
[33:11] you know and it was uh it was the book
[33:14] of redemption
[33:16] all right
[33:17] and we saw then as we went along we got
[33:21] to paragraph 267 of the church age book
[33:24] our sardines in ages where it's really
[33:26] that
[33:27] it found that there was only names
[33:29] written in that book
[33:32] all right
[33:34] but then we spent the time trying to
[33:36] bring it down as we read them from the
[33:39] prophet where he said there were only
[33:41] names written in the book and then he
[33:43] said it was the Bible
[33:45] all right then we were trying to bring
[33:47] out to to get us to understand that the
[33:51] Bible then would be the Book of Life
[33:56] and that would have in that book of life
[33:59] a record of that name that was in the
[34:04] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[34:06] foundation world and in the hand of the
[34:08] one on the throne that the Bible then
[34:10] would be bringing it down to show the
[34:13] life or the what's going on in the world
[34:16] and and things while that name would be
[34:19] here you know that would be just the
[34:21] book of names all right and see then it
[34:24] would be the Bible in the Bible then it
[34:26] would be the Book of Life all right and
[34:28] it would have two sections to it which
[34:31] would be the Eternal section which is
[34:33] the Lamb's Book of Life you know
[34:36] Eternal section and then it would be the
[34:38] book of life which is a record upon
[34:40] Earth of our lives and what's going on
[34:43] so then you can call it the Bible and
[34:46] that's fine because that's that's what
[34:47] it is it's that do it
[34:49] but we found then we got down to just a
[34:52] hit and misses the last
[34:55] and run around and said on paragraph 75
[34:57] of the breach he said now that book is
[35:00] sealed
[35:03] and said you're sealed with a book
[35:06] all right all right
[35:09] now
[35:11] this is something that I've been driving
[35:13] at so I want you to pay close attention
[35:15] for a few minutes
[35:17] of what that I'm speaking
[35:20] then to break the seals
[35:25] I know it reveals what has been what is
[35:28] and what shall come and reveals the
[35:30] whole plan reveal to all of the because
[35:32] it's in the Bible the whole Plan of
[35:34] Redemption everything coming forth
[35:37] but you think about it
[35:39] if the book is sealed
[35:42] and you're sealed in the book what is he
[35:44] talking about you're sealed with the
[35:46] book
[35:48] the book be in the Bible or the book
[35:50] being the the book of redemption
[35:53] all right
[35:55] and see it's sealed right
[35:58] all right and you're sealed with a book
[36:00] amen right so then to break the seals
[36:08] that I've tried my best to express to
[36:10] you for 40-something years in early 40
[36:13] years at least
[36:15] that the seals is not the revealing of
[36:19] the Antichrist
[36:21] amen the seals is a revealing of Jesus
[36:25] Christ amen it doesn't even read in
[36:27] Revelations 1 you know where it says
[36:29] that the Revelation that God gives of
[36:31] Jesus of the Antichrist
[36:35] and it doesn't even speak of that
[36:38] that's what everybody's trying to find
[36:40] or see or what it is
[36:42] me
[36:43] and they're trying to make the seals and
[36:45] the things being the revealing of the
[36:47] Antichrist well that's not true it's
[36:48] revealing of Jesus Christ amen amen all
[36:51] right
[36:52] see then if if it's true what the
[36:55] prophet had to say that the brightest
[36:58] part of the book the price of Mr God
[37:01] revealed
[37:04] and she's to be revealed amen
[37:07] and he's not complete without you I
[37:10] still got some of these things to bring
[37:12] a little in a later message
[37:14] remember I said to God he is not
[37:16] complete without you
[37:18] all right
[37:20] in that book that's there is a book of
[37:23] names
[37:24] through your name is in the book
[37:27] all right
[37:29] now
[37:31] we know it's not Samuel Dale written out
[37:34] because that's not the name that I had
[37:36] before the foundation in the world that
[37:38] was the name My Mother and Daddy gave me
[37:40] Samuel coming from my daddy's Named Sam
[37:43] and Dale being your
[37:46] family name you know right
[37:49] we see the book The Prophet said it's
[37:52] not Arman Neville it is but it's what's
[37:54] going on my arm and Neville is upon the
[37:58] Earth he said then that means your name
[38:01] is in the book
[38:03] all right
[38:05] now
[38:06] and that name being in the book
[38:08] see then if if you're sealed with a book
[38:14] then why would people have trouble with
[38:16] me trying to explain that the the seals
[38:20] is not the reveal in the Antichrist it's
[38:22] a reveal of Jesus Christ and to break
[38:25] the seals doesn't reveal the devil
[38:28] right it revealed Jesus Christ and where
[38:30] he's at amen
[38:34] that's right
[38:36] and what's important I was trying to get
[38:38] across Wednesday night
[38:40] you're sealed with the book
[38:42] all right
[38:43] so to take the seals off the book
[38:47] then it would be revealing you amen
[38:51] it's revealing your name right that's
[38:53] right
[38:54] that's right right
[38:56] he said no no it's just revealing Jesus
[38:58] Christ well that's exactly right
[39:01] because we are Jesus Christ made
[39:03] manifest yes
[39:05] George Paul says Christ in you the hope
[39:09] of glory amen all right
[39:13] so then the bride being part of the book
[39:17] me
[39:19] choose to be revealed
[39:24] so then we're looking at the Book of
[39:26] Revelation to find ourselves right right
[39:32] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:36] but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:38] now where he's at right well they gave
[39:40] you the quote what around said it's not
[39:42] just a revealing of Jesus Christ as
[39:44] being God
[39:45] is it but it's the revealing of Jesus
[39:47] Christ in you right amen
[39:51] so you see ourselves and who we are all
[39:54] right
[39:55] yeah
[39:56] in doing that being
[40:01] there's something I want to get across
[40:03] tonight
[40:05] don't worry about the kinsman redeemer
[40:07] now we will get back to that more when
[40:09] we come to the lamb part of it
[40:11] all right
[40:15] but I want to think a little more about
[40:17] that book
[40:20] you know about these things
[40:24] now
[40:26] this may be and sound
[40:28] odd and simple but yet
[40:31] think on it
[40:35] why is it that
[40:39] the book was not taken in the days of
[40:42] Luther Wesley or Pentecost or whatever
[40:50] are you listening amen so I like to ask
[40:54] questions in that way you're thinking
[40:56] see it's because the book wasn't
[40:59] finished
[41:02] right right
[41:04] see our age was not finished
[41:07] now
[41:10] so the lamb can't take the book
[41:14] until the book is finished
[41:19] that's why I asked you the other day you
[41:20] know
[41:22] these people would say oh in 1963 oh the
[41:25] seals broke to the prophet Redemption
[41:27] was over
[41:28] well then most of us are lost yeah
[41:31] that's right
[41:34] right
[41:35] but see then to think that
[41:41] the reason that it was not finished
[41:47] let your snake with me
[41:49] in 1963 our part
[41:52] your part my part
[41:57] of the book
[41:59] was not finished right amen
[42:03] do you agree yeah
[42:05] keep watching the book that's written
[42:08] about you wasn't written yeah right
[42:11] right
[42:12] so the book wasn't finished
[42:16] see that's why I asked you was
[42:18] Redemption over back then see because as
[42:22] quick as redemption's over then the lamb
[42:26] leaves The Mercy Seat
[42:29] becomes
[42:31] that takes that book
[42:34] and loosens the seals
[42:37] we see the books got to be finished
[42:39] before it can be taken
[42:46] she put it around and was being shown
[42:48] the complete Plan of Redemption
[42:51] past present and future right amen
[42:57] the lamb that leave The Mercy Seat in
[43:00] 63. all right
[43:06] gee if you believe Redemption is still
[43:08] here then the lamb hasn't left the mercy
[43:11] seats yet amen
[43:13] amen but I'd like to put that back in
[43:14] your life
[43:15] you're like yeah
[43:17] not to be sarcastic or hateful but let
[43:20] you think about it amen
[43:22] if he was able to the land left the
[43:25] mercy seat back there in 63.
[43:28] now if he did you're lost
[43:30] because Redemption was over
[43:35] when he leaves The Mercy Seat
[43:36] redemption's over right you agree with
[43:39] that amen right all right
[43:42] keep in
[43:43] the book
[43:45] has got to be completed
[43:50] before the lamb can take the book
[43:53] that's what I'm asking you to read to
[43:55] preach and you'll read these things
[43:59] the prophet would say it like this the
[44:01] book is finished then
[44:05] he said the writing inside then is
[44:07] finished
[44:09] and he said then it's sealed up
[44:12] read the bridge
[44:16] did I say that like that and then I know
[44:18] that a lot of you don't do it
[44:22] because you think you're so smart now
[44:24] some some are just
[44:26] too smart to say that well that's not
[44:29] that's going to read that I don't have
[44:30] time
[44:31] well then there's another group that
[44:33] comes in the middle and says well if I
[44:34] ever do get time I'll read it
[44:36] and the others get well I've done Rich
[44:38] many times don't need to read no more
[44:41] and you won't go home and read it
[44:44] well all right then you want to
[44:47] understand
[44:48] that the prophet is saying the things
[44:50] that I'm saying that's right right amen
[44:53] but see you can't the Kinsmen Redeemer
[44:58] the lamb
[45:01] he can't leave that mercy seat right
[45:04] until the last person that's right it's
[45:07] to be saved
[45:08] comes into the body of Christ that's
[45:10] right
[45:14] keep in the book
[45:18] cannot be taken
[45:21] until it's finished right all right
[45:26] now we read in mark
[45:33] this is Mark what we're off Brothers I
[45:35] don't want to go man Aaron was talking
[45:36] they wrote it at Mark 4 and 28.
[45:40] Jesus is talking about the ear the
[45:43] corner
[45:45] he said and the full corn in the ear
[45:53] now Jesus Christ
[45:55] never went to his death premature
[45:58] right you agree yes
[46:02] yes he was the fully matured seed amen
[46:05] it you agree with that all right
[46:09] see that's why he couldn't be killed
[46:11] when he was in his early Ministry
[46:16] couldn't be touched
[46:18] why because
[46:20] he was not matured
[46:23] all right
[46:26] see it was a fully mature seed
[46:29] that hung on Calvary the word amen all
[46:33] right
[46:34] now
[46:35] so thinking about that think on this
[46:38] point
[46:39] that
[46:45] the book wasn't finished in 63 so how
[46:48] could he take
[46:53] my name in your name had not come forth
[46:59] and some of you may claim Redemption
[47:01] before 63 so you know what I'm talking
[47:03] about I'm talking about as a whole group
[47:06] that most of us came along after 63 to
[47:09] claim our Redemption you know the time
[47:11] of receiving the new birth Etc would be
[47:14] after the 63.
[47:17] but you see then brother Brown is
[47:19] reading the book
[47:20] and being able to look by Revelation
[47:23] into the book and see what will take
[47:25] place he's not telling you what took
[47:27] place in 63.
[47:32] he's telling you what the book says
[47:34] about it
[47:35] just like I was trying to express see
[47:38] then he can tell us what happened in the
[47:40] garden right yep six thousand years ago
[47:44] but he was not back there
[47:48] to see that
[47:52] see the book has got to be completed
[47:57] the last name has got to come in right
[48:00] man before the lamb can leave The Mercy
[48:02] Seat
[48:04] all right
[48:07] see then you see what you're what you're
[48:09] dealing with
[48:11] so I would get away with my ideas or
[48:13] what I used to think
[48:16] because you're saying Redemption was
[48:18] over in 63. then
[48:21] most of the people that would even be
[48:23] listening to what I'm talking about
[48:24] would admit you've got your salvation
[48:26] night for 63 so you'd be saying right
[48:29] and get saved amen that's right
[48:33] you see the book's not complete yet
[48:37] right
[48:41] it was written back there in the Bible
[48:46] that
[48:48] when the towers fall
[48:51] then the light of the moon will be the
[48:53] light of the light in the Moon being the
[48:54] light in the Sun and you'll be it's
[48:56] going to be seven times
[48:59] see then there was no way
[49:02] for the world to come you know the
[49:04] Gentile dispensation as we talk about
[49:06] her situation to come to an end until
[49:08] that took place right
[49:12] right right
[49:14] then you had a Watergate
[49:17] that they stood before the Watergate and
[49:19] read the word
[49:22] wordings right out of the Bible
[49:26] that couldn't be until
[49:28] you know I mean it had to come to buy
[49:31] stuff on the Earth right right right put
[49:34] in the book wasn't complete until that
[49:35] happened
[49:39] Larry are you listening I mean are you
[49:41] paying attention to what I'm trying to
[49:43] say
[49:46] keep in until the book is completed
[49:51] all names are brought in
[49:55] then the lamb can leave The Mercy Seat
[49:57] amen
[50:00] but if they one name today that's not
[50:03] brought into the body of Christ the lamb
[50:05] is still on the Versace scene
[50:07] that's right
[50:11] we see something else have to happen
[50:13] yep
[50:18] if something else has to happen
[50:24] if the book is sealed and the prophet's
[50:26] right when he said the book is sealed
[50:28] and you're sealed with the book
[50:30] well see then the breaking of the seals
[50:32] would be revealing your name right
[50:35] your time upon Earth
[50:41] but the book listen the book has to be
[50:45] completed
[50:47] and then it's sealed
[50:51] right
[50:54] that's how the book winds up sealed
[50:59] if when the life's Redemptive name comes
[51:02] in then the book is sealed
[51:07] you remember how we tried to go through
[51:09] Jeremiah
[51:11] join it when it would go down into
[51:13] bondage
[51:15] and they take the Earthly vessels and
[51:17] they would put the Deeds you would call
[51:19] them today down in there the the thing
[51:22] that would describe the property
[51:24] and they would wind up then
[51:26] when they came back out of captivity
[51:28] they could take out those Scrolls you
[51:31] know in those those paperwork out of the
[51:33] the Earth and vessels and read who owns
[51:37] what property right
[51:40] and then we talked about where the
[51:41] prophet of God said that that was held
[51:45] in an Earthly vessel
[51:46] that was once made flesh amen
[51:51] right right man it was once made flesh
[51:55] and came upon the Earth
[51:57] all right
[51:59] now
[52:01] if that be true then
[52:06] the prophet would be right in what he
[52:08] says
[52:11] he said when he walked the shores of
[52:13] Galilee
[52:15] we was in him
[52:20] come on now
[52:24] we was in him back there
[52:27] or we never will be in him right that's
[52:30] right all right
[52:32] so then
[52:33] all in the Plan of Redemption was sealed
[52:36] up in Jesus Christ
[52:40] amen so then you and I were still up in
[52:41] Jesus Christ amen
[52:45] not these bodies you're looking at
[52:51] the eternal life of those
[52:53] Genesis 1 26 and 27 beings are Galatians
[52:57] 3 16.
[52:59] the being which is the crisis set in
[53:01] Galatians 3 16.
[53:06] so then when Jesus walked the shores of
[53:08] Galilee we were in him
[53:10] not his people right but the eternal
[53:13] life that he had
[53:16] trouble
[53:17] and that was sealed up in that vessel
[53:20] all right
[53:26] now
[53:28] then once it was sealed up
[53:34] see then you had to get it out of there
[53:38] right right sure
[53:42] if we was in him
[53:45] things are ought to be
[53:50] I run said we was in him yep
[53:59] and if it was Jesus was the fullness of
[54:01] the godhead of God excuse me fullness of
[54:04] God manifested
[54:06] he was the fullness of the godhead
[54:07] bodily now listen to it
[54:10] therefore when he came to the Earth and
[54:12] was manifested in flesh you were here in
[54:16] him then
[54:18] because he was the word
[54:22] in the beginning was the word word with
[54:24] God when he walked here we were in him
[54:27] we suffered when we died all right
[54:31] no
[54:33] we see we were sealed up
[54:37] nice
[54:38] wording
[54:41] we were not there as people
[54:44] we were part of that eternal life
[54:48] that was living within him
[54:51] all right
[54:53] but see there was a little
[54:55] a little more connection than just
[54:57] talking about it
[55:00] because of the next statements your
[55:02] Prophet makes go ahead to number two
[55:03] brother
[55:07] which is questions and answers book 1
[55:10] 1964 8 23.
[55:13] God opened up the side of Jesus at
[55:16] Calvary
[55:17] and took out the bride
[55:21] yes
[55:26] and when Jesus died at Calvary remember
[55:28] the bride was taken from the body excuse
[55:31] me and the bride was not taken from the
[55:34] body until the body was dead
[55:40] right so we were already redeemed in him
[55:45] huh
[55:47] I don't want him to get into that part
[55:49] wanting to get into the part of talking
[55:51] about
[55:52] that we were sealed up in him
[55:57] you agree that he was John 1 1.
[56:01] right the beginning was to work Word was
[56:04] God in the word verse 14 which made
[56:06] flesh and dwell among us we bailed him
[56:08] as the only begotten of the father he
[56:10] was made flesh
[56:14] but around said he is those seals you
[56:16] remember we gave it to you the other day
[56:20] the boat was sealed that's why they
[56:23] couldn't understand him when he was here
[56:24] on Earth
[56:29] she was sealed away from the people that
[56:31] they couldn't comprehend
[56:33] the Darian or Earthly vessel was
[56:36] almighty God
[56:39] and the complete Plan of Redemption
[56:41] could dwell in that human vessel
[56:47] run around and said everything Adam lost
[56:51] Jesus Christ redeemed amen
[56:54] right
[56:57] but she to get us out
[57:00] you had to break the seal
[57:03] and it appears to the side of the Lord
[57:05] Jesus
[57:07] amen for the bride to be able to come
[57:09] forth amen
[57:11] amen right
[57:13] yeah right
[57:16] now
[57:19] he was the complete word yes right
[57:25] then he could be sealed up
[57:29] he was the complete ear of corn right
[57:31] the fully maturity or corn
[57:35] he was a seed that went into the ground
[57:37] and quoted scriptures right
[57:41] and he was sealed up because nobody
[57:43] couldn't see him
[57:46] that's right they couldn't see God
[57:50] was sealed up inside of a man
[57:55] he could tell him who he was unless you
[57:58] believe that I am he
[58:01] they couldn't see it
[58:05] all right
[58:08] so then
[58:13] when the bus was finished
[58:19] they couldn't touch him until it was
[58:21] done and
[58:22] yeah
[58:23] but the work was done
[58:26] the word was finished
[58:28] he had fulfilled all the words
[58:32] and then he paid the price
[58:41] the bride was in him at that time right
[58:43] right
[58:48] and she was released
[58:49] from his body
[58:51] that she could come forth then in a what
[58:54] in a mini-membered body
[58:59] he stood and said Lester corn of wheat
[59:03] Falls died into the ground
[59:07] you know he'll abide alone that's right
[59:12] now you don't plant immature corn
[59:16] right you go down to the grocery store
[59:18] and you look there on the shelf and it's
[59:20] got four for a dollar and you got corn
[59:22] there boy you shook that off man that's
[59:24] delicious
[59:27] but don't try to plant it
[59:31] right yes that's right that's right
[59:35] it's not in the stage yet that's right
[59:39] see
[59:41] go to the corner weed had to die and go
[59:43] into the ground
[59:45] before he could come forth in a multiple
[59:47] form
[59:49] then the word that he had gave them at
[59:51] Pentecost
[59:53] for them to understand
[59:56] I ain't got time to explain that point
[59:58] anybody don't tell you what it's
[59:59] happened
[1:00:00] borrow the point Didn't that that fully
[1:00:02] material word went into the ground at
[1:00:04] and I see a council
[1:00:09] but when Luther came forth it was only
[1:00:11] two little shoots got it
[1:00:14] you can't gather it when it's two little
[1:00:16] shoots
[1:00:23] thank you
[1:00:26] ain't much hard to eat
[1:00:29] then he found a shark
[1:00:34] you go out and look at the show oh I got
[1:00:36] corn
[1:00:39] oh
[1:00:41] even when you go out there and see a
[1:00:44] full ear
[1:00:48] it's ready to eat
[1:00:51] you can't plant it
[1:00:53] that's right
[1:00:55] that's why Jesus said to four horn in
[1:00:58] the ear
[1:01:04] do you have to be mature before he could
[1:01:06] be crucified
[1:01:12] the book of him and his life
[1:01:15] had to be written
[1:01:17] within him
[1:01:18] he was the word
[1:01:20] then he could be sealed
[1:01:24] all right
[1:01:27] now
[1:01:31] then what about you and I
[1:01:35] you see why this thing could never
[1:01:37] happen until the end time
[1:01:40] look there was two little shoots come up
[1:01:42] that's right
[1:01:44] that's not fully mature
[1:01:46] Wesley was the title to different things
[1:01:49] you know that's not fully material
[1:01:52] Pentecost
[1:01:54] Azusa Street Pentecost
[1:01:58] was the ship
[1:02:01] that shelters the corn
[1:02:05] and at that stage the prophet said you
[1:02:07] could go down in that wheat and look at
[1:02:10] it and he said they're in that wheat
[1:02:13] there's a little bitty bud
[1:02:16] or if you were talking about it your
[1:02:17] corn
[1:02:21] he said don't even look
[1:02:33] but then you got to wait until it comes
[1:02:35] on over into around here or see in this
[1:02:38] part of the country it's long and about
[1:02:40] October November
[1:02:45] and you can gather the corn
[1:02:48] but still even if you're not real
[1:02:51] careful
[1:02:53] you've got to take the corn off the
[1:02:55] stalk before it matures enough to be
[1:02:58] able to make
[1:02:59] cornmeal
[1:03:03] you can't just go out there and look and
[1:03:05] see it on the stalk and say well that
[1:03:06] looks good that's that's going to look
[1:03:08] like it's dried up it still has a
[1:03:11] certain greenness to it
[1:03:14] right right
[1:03:16] we don't pull it right then take it down
[1:03:18] to the cornmeal make
[1:03:27] you gotta wait until it's fully dried
[1:03:33] so now you understand it
[1:03:37] that's why
[1:03:40] the lamb can't take the book
[1:03:43] until the word is fully matured
[1:03:49] even though all members could be in
[1:03:55] even though
[1:03:57] salvation could be there
[1:04:01] and coming to a close
[1:04:04] you still know how the dryness of the
[1:04:06] Corn
[1:04:11] are you listening
[1:04:15] you gotta have the fully material to
[1:04:17] your corn right
[1:04:19] before you can even talk about it sealed
[1:04:21] and what did we read in Revelations 5 1.
[1:04:27] a book in his hand and the book was what
[1:04:33] sealed
[1:04:38] so you got to wait until he comes to a
[1:04:40] full maturity
[1:04:43] and run around said that's where our
[1:04:45] problem is
[1:04:47] he said we gotta lay in the presence of
[1:04:50] the Sun
[1:04:52] to get out all of the
[1:04:55] witness another word that's right
[1:05:00] we were over in the Philippines and I
[1:05:03] thought it kind of odd but you know they
[1:05:05] got kind of like we have maybe a five
[1:05:07] foot section on the sides of the roads
[1:05:09] that you know it's kind of paved or
[1:05:11] asphalt on it
[1:05:12] we were going down through there
[1:05:15] I was looking like when you done went by
[1:05:17] and seen all these big granaries where
[1:05:19] they were you know doing just tons and
[1:05:21] tons of wheat because they do a lot of
[1:05:24] wheat there in the Philippines
[1:05:26] I look alongside the road you know what
[1:05:28] they were out there on the side of the
[1:05:30] road
[1:05:30] right where the car is driving right by
[1:05:36] because every day they were allowed to
[1:05:38] take home
[1:05:40] a certain amount
[1:05:42] that was their pay
[1:05:46] a lot of them didn't get money they
[1:05:48] could take wheat home with them
[1:05:50] but see the wheat even though it'd been
[1:05:53] gathered
[1:05:57] it was still not matured to make bread
[1:06:00] right
[1:06:03] so you know what they would do they'd
[1:06:05] live right down the side of the road
[1:06:09] and you just drive my
[1:06:12] and on both sides of the road it's just
[1:06:14] wheat
[1:06:16] let on that like a little five foot
[1:06:18] section on each side of the road
[1:06:20] I looked down I said what are they doing
[1:06:25] said they're drying the wheat
[1:06:30] the that's their pay for the day
[1:06:32] and sit there drying the wheat to where
[1:06:35] they can grind it in to make flour
[1:06:43] because I always wondered how it worked
[1:06:45] out you know when they got all that
[1:06:46] stuff going out there you've ever seen
[1:06:48] where they're doing a lot of it and
[1:06:50] especially in in the graineries or
[1:06:52] something they got an old Ox pulling the
[1:06:54] thing going around and just crushing it
[1:06:55] in paint well now you know what that
[1:06:58] dogs does ever once in a while
[1:07:03] right
[1:07:07] well he's at your dinner
[1:07:09] will that work yeah all right wake you
[1:07:13] up okay
[1:07:16] but you see the weights got to be fully
[1:07:18] matured
[1:07:21] even when it's gathered
[1:07:25] it is still not at the point the word
[1:07:27] that you can replant it right then
[1:07:31] go to the heaven and drive enough now I
[1:07:34] know a lot of you thinking oh I just
[1:07:35] seen the kitchen I've seen that my
[1:07:37] brother howl and us can talk about it
[1:07:38] he's back there he knows I know exactly
[1:07:40] what I'm saying because
[1:07:43] you don't go out there when you take the
[1:07:45] corn off at the end of the year you know
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:49] take it and say boy I got it ready to
[1:07:51] plant no it has to lay through the
[1:07:53] winter
[1:07:54] dries out then it gets bigger the next
[1:07:57] year you're capable of planting right
[1:07:59] are you listening amen
[1:08:02] Jesus was the fully matured seed
[1:08:06] all right
[1:08:08] now
[1:08:11] he was promised to come from Genesis to
[1:08:15] be the seed of the woman
[1:08:17] like
[1:08:19] and become a fully mature she
[1:08:21] but at the same time there was a promise
[1:08:24] back there I brought around and said
[1:08:26] that the word would return this is in
[1:08:28] the
[1:08:30] first seal third seal basically more
[1:08:33] that starts in the first but it's
[1:08:34] basically in the third
[1:08:39] because you see Church
[1:08:43] if you and I
[1:08:46] you see what's putting this thing off
[1:08:48] you see what the trouble is
[1:08:51] not laying in the presence of the sun to
[1:08:54] wrap it
[1:08:59] we're running with things and trying to
[1:09:02] keep everything alive and going I should
[1:09:06] but I want the maturity
[1:09:10] amen then when the maturity comes you
[1:09:12] don't want to shout but you know how to
[1:09:15] shout then you know what you're shouting
[1:09:16] about wonderful
[1:09:18] me
[1:09:19] like I told Brother Bill there today is
[1:09:21] you know what I've told you that I've
[1:09:24] been in a Revival ever since I've been
[1:09:25] in this message
[1:09:27] but for two years now I've been praying
[1:09:29] for God to send a Revival in this church
[1:09:31] right here
[1:09:36] that's not a worldwide sweeping Revival
[1:09:38] is it
[1:09:40] I'm not looking for something like that
[1:09:41] yeah
[1:09:44] run around and said he'd take those
[1:09:45] seven unknown Thunders to wake up the
[1:09:47] bride for a Revival
[1:09:54] you see why it's took so long to preach
[1:09:56] the word
[1:10:02] is to try to put the word in to get it
[1:10:04] every bit into exactly the place it's
[1:10:06] supposed to be right
[1:10:10] and to realize that Luther Wesley and MC
[1:10:13] was partial realization for their days
[1:10:15] right yes amen the bride must come forth
[1:10:19] yes
[1:10:20] and the purity of the word
[1:10:26] that she could be the word
[1:10:28] because when we go into rapture
[1:10:30] it would be capable of taking what's in
[1:10:33] going in the Rapture you know taking us
[1:10:35] up like that in a change
[1:10:37] that part that's coming to the last
[1:10:39] would be capable of being replanted amen
[1:10:42] because it's going to be fully matured
[1:10:44] word
[1:10:48] but it won't be because we're going up
[1:10:51] all right amen
[1:10:54] see we had to be taken then out of his
[1:10:57] side
[1:10:59] the calvary
[1:11:03] because we're the seed
[1:11:05] s right
[1:11:07] we we we're the ones that's going into
[1:11:09] the ground right
[1:11:10] the Holy Ghost never went the ground
[1:11:12] right right
[1:11:15] it's the word or seed that was going to
[1:11:17] go into the ground in the Dark Ages
[1:11:20] and then come forward
[1:11:22] but see a promise
[1:11:25] the word would come to full maturity
[1:11:27] again
[1:11:30] gee when the book is completed
[1:11:33] then it's sealed that's right
[1:11:38] then the lamb can take it
[1:11:42] and break the seal yes
[1:11:45] come on
[1:11:47] okay
[1:11:49] right well it's just too much to think
[1:11:51] about why
[1:11:53] I'll give you the pulpit women anybody
[1:11:55] could let you explain it
[1:11:58] come on now I'm not sarcastic not
[1:12:00] hateful it's just truthful that's right
[1:12:03] I've studied for 40 something years
[1:12:05] about a message
[1:12:07] been ridiculed of all forms of trying to
[1:12:09] preach the word and keep it word word
[1:12:12] word word
[1:12:14] and not far after all of these garbage
[1:12:16] can doctrines just went around the
[1:12:18] message and try to stay with the word
[1:12:21] and been ridiculed and very unpopular
[1:12:25] around the people of the message
[1:12:29] for being the fact that I've tried to
[1:12:31] stay with the word
[1:12:39] when you write a document
[1:12:43] you know you're writing a story doing
[1:12:45] whatever you're writing the document
[1:12:47] and then you seal it right
[1:12:51] you know it's not rolled it up but it's
[1:12:53] a seal it's a segment a signature once
[1:12:56] you're finishing up with you know the
[1:12:57] book is finished you write your name to
[1:12:59] it
[1:13:00] you're sealing the book
[1:13:03] that book is not supposed to be used by
[1:13:05] anyone else it's a copyrighted and all
[1:13:08] of those words that you put with it amen
[1:13:15] you know until this book is completely
[1:13:17] written it can't be single that's right
[1:13:20] and until it's sealed it can't be
[1:13:22] unsealed
[1:13:25] you see why it wouldn't have worked in
[1:13:28] the days of Lutheran Wesleyan Pentecost
[1:13:29] yes
[1:13:31] and we're not fully material words
[1:13:34] they had the word of the rage
[1:13:36] thank God they're part of the Bride
[1:13:40] but this end time Friday's got to come
[1:13:42] back to the pure word
[1:13:46] unadulterated your Prophet would say
[1:13:49] from any Creed
[1:13:51] man
[1:13:55] look at number three
[1:13:59] she's taken from the Easter seal right
[1:14:01] at 119.
[1:14:03] you talking about the ceiling the carbox
[1:14:05] and all of the different things
[1:14:08] and then it sealed to its destination
[1:14:12] any seal is a is finished work when you
[1:14:15] write a document then it's sealed at the
[1:14:18] end never sealed
[1:14:20] until it's finished
[1:14:26] you need a document this is a document
[1:14:28] this is the Bible this is the word of
[1:14:30] God
[1:14:32] the next one
[1:14:38] evening messenger look what he says
[1:14:42] you talk about each age having a
[1:14:44] messenger and all coming down
[1:14:47] look what he says
[1:14:49] but it was sealed on the back side of
[1:14:51] the book
[1:14:52] the Seven Seals was on the backside of
[1:14:55] the book
[1:14:56] and actually before the ceiling broke
[1:14:58] remember this is
[1:14:59] 11 16 and 63. they opened in in uh
[1:15:04] March all right
[1:15:08] January
[1:15:09] you know this is January but to see
[1:15:11] what's broken and Mark that's right
[1:15:14] now watch what he said the seven seal
[1:15:16] thrown on the backside of the book after
[1:15:18] the book is written
[1:15:21] all right now is that what I've been
[1:15:24] saying all right amen after the book is
[1:15:26] written and it's sealed back there were
[1:15:30] seven seals and no one knows what they
[1:15:33] are see but in the days of the voice of
[1:15:36] the Seven Angels right
[1:15:38] but the book has got to be written ready
[1:15:40] to breach
[1:15:46] it's got to be written
[1:15:48] then it's sealed
[1:15:52] see that's one that you're looking at
[1:15:53] this and so I didn't know the book was
[1:15:56] sealed up
[1:15:57] why I've been able to read it ever since
[1:16:00] I was in the Baptist Church
[1:16:03] well I got four gold stars for reading
[1:16:06] in one year
[1:16:08] huh
[1:16:11] I didn't know it was sealed you know
[1:16:14] your Prophet didn't know it was sealed I
[1:16:16] didn't bring that one but
[1:16:17] you ought to know it
[1:16:19] he thought he preached it in the in the
[1:16:22] 50s there and up in the early 60s of the
[1:16:25] Seven Seals
[1:16:27] yeah
[1:16:28] you want to imagine sure supplies where
[1:16:31] he said
[1:16:32] I didn't even know the books and nobody
[1:16:35] knew the book was was a single book
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:41] we thought Jesus at Calvary paid the
[1:16:44] price opened the book we can read all of
[1:16:46] it right
[1:16:48] right
[1:16:49] now is that not to come the
[1:16:51] comprehension that you get of most
[1:16:53] people in the message and where they are
[1:16:54] that's nice
[1:16:59] you talk about a seal book why do you
[1:17:01] need to see a book The book's been open
[1:17:02] what bro did don't you understand it was
[1:17:04] opening profit in 63.
[1:17:07] boo can't see on no more
[1:17:12] I'm sorry
[1:17:14] I know that I'm hateful about the things
[1:17:16] but telling me whether it's the truth or
[1:17:18] not
[1:17:19] just because that Prophet preached it in
[1:17:22] 63 you hadn't even heard it until 85 or
[1:17:25] 90.
[1:17:27] and yet
[1:17:31] the book was opened
[1:17:35] it's only open to the prophet right
[1:17:38] right he was talking about it last night
[1:17:39] it got over there at the end of it
[1:17:43] run around and said said don't give me
[1:17:45] questions on anything he said I won't
[1:17:47] question on the seals only
[1:17:53] he got his questions
[1:17:56] and he was looking at the questions
[1:17:59] there was one question asked about the
[1:18:02] seals the man of sin sitting in the
[1:18:04] temple of God showing himself to be as
[1:18:05] God was at the first seal and he said
[1:18:07] yes the rest of it should we wear
[1:18:09] pantyhose or what about water baptism or
[1:18:11] what about this you know and that's what
[1:18:13] he'd come out and said you know what he
[1:18:15] said it's gone from you
[1:18:19] he saw his wife said last night he saw
[1:18:21] the questions it would ask so he knew it
[1:18:23] was gone from the people
[1:18:27] said run around the company with the
[1:18:28] Lord
[1:18:30] but she did we know when we was an
[1:18:32] organized religion that there was a
[1:18:33] sealed book
[1:18:35] even though we could read there were
[1:18:36] seven seals right
[1:18:39] but we didn't know the book was sealed
[1:18:43] and we definitely didn't know we were
[1:18:45] sealed with the book right
[1:18:47] Oh you mean that's making too much out
[1:18:49] the bush
[1:18:50] and my brother Bill said this morning
[1:18:52] ain't making a knife all right amen amen
[1:18:54] right that's right amen
[1:18:58] I'll see you on the book
[1:19:02] it's got to be completed before it can
[1:19:04] be sealed
[1:19:06] all the names had to be made manifest on
[1:19:09] Earth
[1:19:11] I'm quoting from the breach if you'll
[1:19:13] read it you'll hear it all the names had
[1:19:16] to be made manifest
[1:19:18] before the lamb could take the book
[1:19:28] so then it says one name left is not
[1:19:30] redeemed today but lamb ain't left The
[1:19:32] Mercy Seat that's right amen
[1:19:35] how close will that be
[1:19:39] that's right
[1:19:43] I quoted last night the brother
[1:19:44] questioned me about it
[1:19:46] so I said Hey brother Joe how about
[1:19:48] running it up guys
[1:19:51] remember I said I don't know how many be
[1:19:53] saved in that last moment
[1:19:56] to Rapture the church
[1:20:01] you can run it up brother Joe bring it
[1:20:02] on out if you can
[1:20:04] I know we can find it in the flash but
[1:20:06] he found it last night for me
[1:20:08] I appreciate these brothers that are
[1:20:09] sitting around making this
[1:20:11] that's right better run said I don't
[1:20:14] know how many you'll be saved we say Oh
[1:20:15] No Redemption is going to be over and
[1:20:17] then all these things are going to
[1:20:18] happen where did she get all those
[1:20:20] things from
[1:20:25] it's because you're already in
[1:20:29] and you ain't worried about nobody else
[1:20:33] but if you don't get nothing out of the
[1:20:36] message don't get one thing
[1:20:37] the book has got to be completed every
[1:20:40] name has got to be make manifest and
[1:20:43] redeemed before the the book can be
[1:20:46] sealed up
[1:20:49] now to be a complete book before it can
[1:20:51] be sealed up then it comes it's got to
[1:20:53] be sealed up before it can be unsealed
[1:20:55] that's right
[1:20:57] even if you want to leave off the
[1:20:59] ceiling of the book
[1:21:01] you got you know one plain common sense
[1:21:04] the book has got to be complete every
[1:21:06] name has got to be there before it can
[1:21:08] be taken sure absolutely even if you
[1:21:11] don't like my other ways of bringing
[1:21:12] punishments
[1:21:14] you know it can't be taken until every
[1:21:16] name
[1:21:17] is made to manifest that's right
[1:21:21] well then why are we looking at it
[1:21:23] thinking order maybe the Redemption was
[1:21:25] Lord see that scares people
[1:21:30] and that makes people say well I don't
[1:21:32] know where to try or not
[1:21:34] you see why I'm against those things so
[1:21:36] much people say well I don't know where
[1:21:38] to try or not I don't know where to see
[1:21:40] God or not Redemption was over at 63.
[1:21:43] mother you know Brothers know all the
[1:21:45] people pleasing yeah
[1:21:49] not like we've coming in the back door
[1:21:50] here to church one time this brother
[1:21:54] you good old brother but we're gonna
[1:21:55] have communion that day and I'm gonna
[1:21:58] back back here you know on our deal you
[1:22:00] got it let me get with my
[1:22:02] won't forget he's coming in the door
[1:22:04] this brother I had brought out the cups
[1:22:06] you know the individual cups I know that
[1:22:09] there are a lot of people in like that's
[1:22:10] all right we'll take it either way you
[1:22:12] want it this church folks that one cup
[1:22:14] well one cup folks how many well how
[1:22:16] many no problem
[1:22:18] but the brother he said brother Dale all
[1:22:21] the Believers in the message just have
[1:22:24] one cup
[1:22:28] well Boy you know you could spend well
[1:22:30] when I get through this because it
[1:22:32] I knew brother mulchman was dying
[1:22:35] brother Thomas and then was there they
[1:22:37] took communion and Tabernacle with many
[1:22:40] cups I knew all of that I could argue
[1:22:42] but the man that was saying it to me had
[1:22:44] been to the Tabernacle
[1:22:48] you burn around him personally
[1:22:54] but he said all the Believers use one
[1:22:57] cup I just opened the door and let him
[1:22:58] go on in I said we believe a little bit
[1:23:00] of it around here
[1:23:02] I wasn't going to argue with him about
[1:23:04] nothing
[1:23:06] because it wouldn't be no need of it but
[1:23:08] look what he says
[1:23:10] this is the message Christ The Mystery
[1:23:11] of God revealed 1963 7.8 after the seals
[1:23:15] broke after this all of the people said
[1:23:17] Redemption is over and there's nothing
[1:23:19] here look what he says paragraph 227.
[1:23:22] I don't say there's going to be ex-olds
[1:23:24] today now I don't get that all wrong I
[1:23:28] never said that I don't know how many is
[1:23:31] to be going to be saved in that that
[1:23:35] that's the the last moment to Rapture
[1:23:39] that little group
[1:23:40] you'll be a small group
[1:23:44] you say
[1:23:45] you mean you still think Redemption is
[1:23:47] for people amen that's right
[1:23:50] amen why would I preach salvation if I
[1:23:53] didn't that's right believe it
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:58] but get the point now
[1:24:03] it's not the book it's got to be
[1:24:05] completed before the lamb can take the
[1:24:08] book
[1:24:12] it's got to be the fully matured word
[1:24:15] and you and I are gonna have to give
[1:24:17] birth to that all right let's get into
[1:24:19] the message
[1:24:20] look at number five brother
[1:24:24] putting Bobby back there I think with it
[1:24:27] presuming 62-16
[1:24:30] morning service
[1:24:32] Mondays we get a bunch of denominations
[1:24:34] this time out of this revival
[1:24:37] we sold denominational seed
[1:24:41] what we need today brother you can say
[1:24:43] what you want to about it we need the
[1:24:46] gospel pure holy unadulterated word of
[1:24:49] God song
[1:24:51] and when this light comes on it it'll
[1:24:53] bring forth that church
[1:24:55] God's predestinated amen don't presume
[1:24:59] about nothing take God's word and move
[1:25:01] right on he promised he'd be here he's
[1:25:04] here amen
[1:25:06] yep
[1:25:12] if that ain't shown down in the bride
[1:25:13] where are we going look at the next one
[1:25:16] paragraph four
[1:25:19] 12 of Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:25:23] Revelation is not known by denomination
[1:25:26] he is known by Revelation excuse me
[1:25:28] revelation God is not known by
[1:25:30] denomination he's known by Revelation
[1:25:32] look God in his body Christ and Christ
[1:25:34] in his body the bride oh my God God made
[1:25:39] manifest in Christ Christ made manifest
[1:25:41] in the bride
[1:25:43] and as God took from the body of Adam
[1:25:46] the woman she failed then God has took
[1:25:50] from the body of Christ his flesh his
[1:25:53] body which is his word and is bringing a
[1:25:57] bride out of that that won't call for
[1:25:59] denominational Creed no sir but she's
[1:26:02] coming back with a pure unadulterated
[1:26:04] word of God being
[1:26:07] manifested amen
[1:26:09] that's what's up for me and you did amen
[1:26:12] amen right right these are for me and
[1:26:14] you to do okay I'm right excuse number
[1:26:16] seven
[1:26:19] a lot of these are some deferred single
[1:26:21] except you go read it
[1:26:23] the third seed will be 963 1963 320. all
[1:26:27] right about 97. now but God full of
[1:26:30] Mercy made a way to redeem that woman
[1:26:33] and now he promised her telling her that
[1:26:36] sometime in the future the true word
[1:26:39] would come to her again the true word
[1:26:41] will be made known to her
[1:26:45] now remember that because he promised
[1:26:48] Christ through the woman and Christ is
[1:26:50] the word all right so now Jesus Christ
[1:26:54] a fulfillment of the promise
[1:26:56] great to come right but that's not all
[1:26:59] the promise now just keep on going
[1:27:00] number eight
[1:27:02] she owned the third seal now we noticed
[1:27:05] that God told Eve and after so long a
[1:27:07] Time
[1:27:08] the word is coming back to you
[1:27:11] now how did she fall I want my class
[1:27:14] to say it
[1:27:15] what did she fall from
[1:27:18] what did he fall from the word is that
[1:27:21] right the word and God said he'd make a
[1:27:23] way to redeem her back to the word again
[1:27:26] all right after so long a Time the word
[1:27:29] would be known to her again the word
[1:27:31] would come for that purpose
[1:27:33] that's Jesus Christ right right
[1:27:36] come on down to the next one
[1:27:39] still on the third seal
[1:27:41] hold tight now what I'm saying
[1:27:43] the word would come for her for one
[1:27:45] purpose that was for Redemption all
[1:27:47] right but until until then she had a
[1:27:50] substitute
[1:27:52] now what's that word that would would
[1:27:55] work
[1:27:56] that would work until the time arrived
[1:27:58] for the original word now the substitute
[1:28:01] with the blood of bulls and goats
[1:28:03] right right but now remember you're
[1:28:06] gonna come over to church age in just a
[1:28:08] minute you told her the word would come
[1:28:10] to her again but until that times he
[1:28:12] gave her a substitute until that time
[1:28:15] arrived so he gave her an offering to
[1:28:17] make a substitute for that blood now the
[1:28:20] blood of Bloods and goats like but it
[1:28:22] didn't take away her sin all right other
[1:28:24] than that
[1:28:28] foreign
[1:28:33] times that he would or the word would
[1:28:36] come back to her again now remember
[1:28:39] you remember that what she lost from it
[1:28:43] could be restored because there's only
[1:28:44] one thing and restore and that's the
[1:28:46] word we're going to the next
[1:28:48] just getting them lined up
[1:28:51] let's see here's what we got to do
[1:28:55] now to save the time in between
[1:28:58] I'll be glad to show you these but if
[1:29:00] you'll read the third seal you'll find
[1:29:02] it
[1:29:04] you see Luther and Wesley had partial
[1:29:07] realization of the word
[1:29:10] right all right
[1:29:11] Luther Wesley Pinnacle they had a
[1:29:14] substitute okay
[1:29:16] not a substitute like substituting this
[1:29:20] for that
[1:29:21] the Old Testament was not substituting
[1:29:24] uh uh garbage cans and then the blood of
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ it was the blood of the
[1:29:30] animal and then Jesus Christ was the
[1:29:32] blood of a human right so when the
[1:29:34] church ages it was a substitute
[1:29:37] the word for the age was substitute
[1:29:40] because it was not in its fullness it
[1:29:43] was not a fully matured word or seed so
[1:29:47] it couldn't go into the ground
[1:29:49] but then it's got to come back in the
[1:29:50] end time to be the fully matured seed in
[1:29:54] you and I until here's what we've got to
[1:29:55] do now what are we to do
[1:29:57] that's to make sure God revealed what
[1:29:59] but she's coming back with a pure
[1:30:02] unadulterated word of God being
[1:30:05] manifested who's coming back today going
[1:30:09] to the next
[1:30:11] you must be born again 61 12 31 see what
[1:30:14] he knew you might know the false
[1:30:16] teachers will bring false birth
[1:30:18] true prophets will bring the word
[1:30:21] the birth of the word Christ false
[1:30:24] prophets will bring false birth the
[1:30:27] birth of churches the birth of Creeds
[1:30:29] the birth of denominations and things
[1:30:32] that's what they bring look at the next
[1:30:34] one
[1:30:36] word is written on 6 62 312 now for the
[1:30:41] birth of the word is Christ
[1:30:44] not a polluted with denominations
[1:30:48] the early church no denomination just
[1:30:50] the word of God and spirit irrigated
[1:30:52] brother that God laid the word down like
[1:30:56] that and the Holy Spirit irrigated and
[1:30:58] there she went she brought forth
[1:31:00] children certainly
[1:31:02] what do we got a house come on today
[1:31:07] birth pains
[1:31:09] 65 124. now her messenger is promised in
[1:31:13] Malachi in the fourth chapter he's
[1:31:15] promised to do it and the message is to
[1:31:18] bring back the word
[1:31:20] bring the people back to the word right
[1:31:23] birth to be is to be choose to be
[1:31:26] delivered of a new birth from According
[1:31:28] to Malachi 4. amen
[1:31:31] as you're in our job
[1:31:34] somebody's got to give birth to the seed
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:38] before the book can be sealed
[1:31:42] and the book ain't sealed it can't be
[1:31:44] opened
[1:31:46] all right
[1:31:51] that's the same one as the paragraph of
[1:31:53] this same message
[1:31:56] um birthday
[1:31:57] the word must deliver the word right
[1:32:00] Church
[1:32:01] this progress 178 coming on down for
[1:32:04] where we would the church has got to be
[1:32:06] delivered out of her a bride for Christ
[1:32:09] then that fell asleep in all ages will
[1:32:12] make up that
[1:32:13] rides that come out on the word that
[1:32:16] they come out on like from your feet
[1:32:18] coming to your head
[1:32:20] she gets gets greater and the more you
[1:32:23] have to have and so forth as the body
[1:32:25] grows up so the body of Christ grow up
[1:32:31] and then finally the head will come to
[1:32:33] hit the head will be what
[1:32:37] it's linked to the Head
[1:32:39] we got to be capped off
[1:32:46] sorry
[1:32:49] another random quote said after the door
[1:32:52] of the Gentile church is closed God
[1:32:54] willing on a church
[1:32:56] he will do in one year what theologist
[1:32:58] is trying to do in 2000 he's doing it
[1:33:01] now he said
[1:33:04] do you and I have got to become the word
[1:33:06] amen right amen it ain't a choice it
[1:33:10] ain't a thought or a maybe or a
[1:33:13] we've got to become the fully matured
[1:33:15] work
[1:33:16] we've got to lay in the presence of the
[1:33:18] sun to write
[1:33:19] we can't just keep playing around with
[1:33:21] it let the seed nut put the next one
[1:33:25] he's not out with a shook 65 to 18.
[1:33:28] Pentecost stop speaking in tongues what
[1:33:32] they denied the birth of the word
[1:33:35] what was the pentecostal's denying
[1:33:38] his message
[1:33:39] right okay come on oh it's Pentecostals
[1:33:44] tonight is this a street Pentecost
[1:33:47] is when the message comes forth they
[1:33:49] denied the birth of the word right
[1:33:50] because it's so down in our denomination
[1:33:53] that's exactly what it did
[1:33:56] it'll take so much of it but don't take
[1:33:58] the rest of it it denied the birth of
[1:34:01] the word just like Mary did
[1:34:03] once there will not be any more
[1:34:06] organizations
[1:34:08] after this
[1:34:11] all right
[1:34:13] look what he goes on to say there in
[1:34:15] that message
[1:34:19] Murray was not the seed
[1:34:25] she was a carrier
[1:34:30] remember she had the baby inside of her
[1:34:34] she was a carrier she was not the seed
[1:34:38] Mary was not what was Mary
[1:34:41] she was a shuck
[1:34:44] yep great D's
[1:34:46] get the message see he's not an hour to
[1:34:49] show
[1:34:49] there's two of them
[1:34:52] priests in jail for no one wanted to
[1:34:54] know so he's not there with a Shook and
[1:34:56] get the message Masterpiece you think
[1:34:59] I'm so slow see we could spend three
[1:35:01] months preaching on this this part here
[1:35:04] and maybe I need to but we don't have
[1:35:07] time
[1:35:08] get the message masterpiece
[1:35:12] run around why would he say Mary is not
[1:35:14] the word
[1:35:15] or the seed
[1:35:19] because she wasn't the seed was in her
[1:35:21] that's right amen
[1:35:24] Street Pentecost was not the fully
[1:35:27] matured seed
[1:35:29] it was a carrier
[1:35:32] going to the next one really
[1:35:35] you may have it up there already because
[1:35:37] we started out on burger at 97.
[1:35:42] if you can't get it off of what's on the
[1:35:45] message
[1:35:46] you never will understand it so let me
[1:35:49] just preach a minute
[1:35:52] see when this thing coming forth
[1:35:55] Lutheran Wesley and them they were the
[1:35:57] right of their age
[1:35:58] they were the people of the age
[1:36:01] zester Street was the Bride of the age
[1:36:04] but Azusa Street type Mary
[1:36:07] right
[1:36:08] Mary was a carrier of the word right the
[1:36:13] seed was inside of Mary
[1:36:16] she gave birth to the seed that's what
[1:36:18] the people in the Macy's think we've got
[1:36:20] to give birth to the seed the message
[1:36:22] that's fine
[1:36:24] that's true but where's the seed coming
[1:36:27] from right
[1:36:31] what do you mean Brothers we give birth
[1:36:33] to Jesus Christ what was Jesus Christ
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:41] you give birth to the word I preached on
[1:36:44] these things many times to you
[1:36:47] we must give birth to the word yes
[1:36:50] that's fine
[1:36:52] but then we must become the word
[1:36:55] because there's no carriers
[1:36:58] nice Mary right
[1:37:02] that's right Mary was the last carrier
[1:37:06] she carried the seed and gave birth to
[1:37:08] it Azusa Street your Prophet said yes
[1:37:12] they gave birth to Jesus Christ right
[1:37:15] yes but it would just be a baby form
[1:37:19] see you and I you and I must become that
[1:37:21] word
[1:37:23] and it must be completed right and once
[1:37:26] the book is completed then it'll be
[1:37:28] sealed right yes
[1:37:32] don't nobody nobody will be able to
[1:37:35] understand it
[1:37:37] and once it's sealed
[1:37:39] it can be broken yes it'll only be
[1:37:42] broken to the bride
[1:37:47] you looked her name couldn't stand up
[1:37:48] here and try to find their name they
[1:37:50] couldn't find the Plan of Redemption to
[1:37:52] get this body
[1:37:53] because they believed in getting a new
[1:37:55] one yes
[1:37:58] we don't believe in getting a new body
[1:37:59] to it we believe this body is redeemed
[1:38:06] we see you and I the book has got to be
[1:38:09] complete
[1:38:10] now if you listen to the whole message
[1:38:11] I'll review a second
[1:38:13] see then the book has got to be
[1:38:15] completed every name that would ever be
[1:38:18] in the book has got to be made manifest
[1:38:20] on Earth but not just manifest on Earth
[1:38:23] as a person but manifest in by the new
[1:38:27] birth in that person there is your name
[1:38:30] in the book
[1:38:32] are you with me there's your name in the
[1:38:35] book yes and the book has got to be
[1:38:38] completed
[1:38:39] then the lamb can take the book
[1:38:43] and loose the seals
[1:38:49] because we're the book now did I end up
[1:38:52] Wednesday night was that one of them
[1:38:57] do you see why then
[1:39:01] when we leave out of here
[1:39:04] in a rapture
[1:39:07] those two Prophets
[1:39:10] will take this message
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:15] and deliver it to Israel amen
[1:39:18] I've read Around coming back and do it
[1:39:20] now Moses and Elijah
[1:39:22] they'll take this message
[1:39:25] going to see a book right over in the
[1:39:27] last of it read the prophet said they'll
[1:39:29] tell them
[1:39:30] you missed it right you turned down the
[1:39:33] opportunity to be the bride of Christ
[1:39:35] the children of God blessed the Gentiles
[1:39:38] has received it now they've gone in a
[1:39:40] Rapture and you are in a tribulation
[1:39:43] period amen because of that to be purged
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:48] do you think that we're not going to be
[1:39:50] made known to Israel sure
[1:39:53] see I am not in a garbage can with
[1:39:55] others it's instead one brother said
[1:39:57] that he'd be a gentile bride and a
[1:40:00] gentile Prophet that would go to Israel
[1:40:02] that'd be the two witnesses and I told
[1:40:03] him no sir
[1:40:05] I'm sorry I just put around and said
[1:40:08] it'd be two Jews you don't believe me
[1:40:11] against all Brian is just our promising
[1:40:12] no sir right
[1:40:14] but
[1:40:23] that's all right I just said it I
[1:40:26] believe it amen
[1:40:28] what you see
[1:40:30] they're going to tell them Jews
[1:40:32] you know like we all sit around and tell
[1:40:35] you know there's Burgers stores ever
[1:40:37] since I've been in the message
[1:40:39] because you know Paul and Peter and him
[1:40:41] one day when we'll get there and they'll
[1:40:43] say uh
[1:40:44] you know
[1:40:49] Chris what age did you come out of
[1:40:53] I come out a lady you'll see you I took
[1:40:56] a change of the body
[1:40:58] like a brother said right now it was
[1:41:00] built when somebody was saying it
[1:41:01] weighed one
[1:41:03] they'll say sit down right here beside
[1:41:06] me I need about five million years
[1:41:09] to talk to you about what you went
[1:41:12] through amen because all I had to do was
[1:41:14] just take a stand and give my life but
[1:41:17] you had to take a stand
[1:41:19] and live in a world that would organize
[1:41:21] religion to every core and everything
[1:41:23] fighting you and you become the word
[1:41:27] and we were waiting on you to do the
[1:41:29] heaven see they without us cannot
[1:41:35] do you understand what I'm getting here
[1:41:39] which everybody thinks Redemption over
[1:41:41] 63 because of lamb left emergency
[1:41:43] and they'll tell you for sure they'll
[1:41:45] say no I don't believe rejection was
[1:41:47] over now in 63 but that's when the lamb
[1:41:50] left emergency
[1:41:51] now you showed me that right
[1:41:57] if what I said is right
[1:42:01] then the lamb is still on The Mercy Seat
[1:42:04] amen
[1:42:06] yes sir
[1:42:08] not because of my family or anything
[1:42:10] like that or something private
[1:42:14] maybe a cause of the word
[1:42:17] lamb will stay on that Mercy Seat until
[1:42:20] Redemption is over
[1:42:24] and then he can take you
[1:42:27] the sealed book the word of God
[1:42:30] and show you the Israel amen as the
[1:42:33] people of God
[1:42:36] that's right
[1:42:38] we got to be sealed up before we can be
[1:42:40] broke
[1:42:41] the book's got to be complete for it to
[1:42:44] be sealed
[1:42:48] the mystery of redemption
[1:42:51] well I thought existing up here that's
[1:42:53] what we've all thought you know
[1:42:59] otherwise don't say that I said to lamb
[1:43:01] left the mercy
[1:43:05] and see he missed the lamb left of Mercy
[1:43:07] Seat it was no longer Mercy
[1:43:11] the minute the lamb leaves of Mercy Seat
[1:43:13] it becomes judgment seat right right
[1:43:15] amen that's why John was told
[1:43:19] when he asked for a Kinsmen he said the
[1:43:23] line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:43:26] to loose the Seven Seals because the
[1:43:28] line is judgment
[1:43:30] nice
[1:43:31] but when he saw it it was a lamb because
[1:43:35] Redemption wasn't over right amen and
[1:43:38] one day redemption will be over and
[1:43:41] he'll be the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:43:46] and then you and I walk off the shirt
[1:43:49] amen right
[1:43:53] see the book has got to be sealed
[1:43:55] it's working me open
[1:43:57] it can be written before it can be
[1:43:59] sealed
[1:44:00] keep repeating that because that in your
[1:44:02] mind your mind go home what did he say
[1:44:08] you know your mind just don't comprehend
[1:44:10] a lot of times I said something last
[1:44:12] night to one brother and I said it about
[1:44:13] four times
[1:44:15] and he still quoting back to me every
[1:44:17] time wrong I finally told him I said
[1:44:20] hold it
[1:44:21] say what I'm saying you know
[1:44:26] and he said oh okay
[1:44:29] his mind was saying one thing my mind
[1:44:32] was saying another thing he thought he
[1:44:33] was saying that word every word I was
[1:44:35] saying but he wouldn't do it
[1:44:40] hmm
[1:44:41] what do you understand yes
[1:44:46] the book in the hand of the one sitting
[1:44:47] on the throne
[1:44:50] it's a book of names
[1:44:53] and I killed all those names
[1:44:56] don't manifest on Earth
[1:44:58] this book has the record already written
[1:45:00] about us before we got here
[1:45:03] but it tells the day and the hour We're
[1:45:04] living right and the problems that's
[1:45:06] going on
[1:45:09] then it'll be sealed up
[1:45:12] yep
[1:45:13] then the lamb can take the book
[1:45:16] and show the complete Plan of Redemption
[1:45:19] or in other words brother Reynolds said
[1:45:22] when the lamb takes the book said he'll
[1:45:26] claim his right of redemption
[1:45:31] my words claim you and I
[1:45:36] all right
[1:45:37] Mustang
[1:45:43] so are you sealed
[1:45:46] that's why I've always tried to get you
[1:45:48] to see
[1:45:50] the Holy Spirit
[1:45:53] is the seal
[1:45:55] and you're sealed by the holy spirit
[1:45:57] amen
[1:46:02] people look at you sisters especially as
[1:46:04] like walking down through Walmarts or
[1:46:07] town or something they see with the long
[1:46:09] dress and long hair and no makeup
[1:46:13] they look at you and they say
[1:46:16] them poor old people yep
[1:46:22] or open
[1:46:24] they don't know that they're looking at
[1:46:26] a sealed word
[1:46:29] they're looking at a word to see what up
[1:46:31] in the heart it's causing you to act
[1:46:34] that way if it's not you're just doing
[1:46:36] it because your husband wants you to or
[1:46:37] whatever
[1:46:39] but when you can really see it
[1:46:45] the book is sealed we're sealed with a
[1:46:47] book right what we got right let's try

[1:51:08] he had a whole lot more emotion than you
[1:51:10] saw today whatsoever and yeah right I'm
[1:51:13] sure he'd still be that way in some ways
[1:51:15] but he settled down
