TRANSCRIPT
========================================
come on all right remember all the ones that are not with us today because brother Bob you know obviously where he is and remember that family they're having the funerals tomorrow at 10 or 12 or something last bolon B Bon Wednesday night as soon as church was out what as soon as church was out WN just remember them in your prayer Monica's mother pass we had just Monica's mother died Wednesday night so um they're all down there at U we funeral will be tomorrow about I heard service Wednesday he said she wasn't doing well well they sent a text just as soon as a service was over she had just passed doing all she says she can feel the strength that she's drawing from prayers of you know believer yeah just pray for the family they've got some decisions they got to make about finances I don't know if they had insurance and I don't know if they had burial insurance so let's just keep them in your prayers as far as that goes cuz it does cost money to do things nowadays so and let me make a suggestion if you don't have insurance life insurance at least get some it's very cheap not for me it's well if you had it before and you were paying it it would be cheap okay I'm not berating you at all but why in the world would you die and leave your kids and family to have to pay the Sheep it's called cremation still you got to pay but if you're sick for 6 months before you die no even if you are aadab you have to pay for transport of the yeah yeah and yeah cremation is $68,000 so what do you I mean it still cost at least that much where I check yeah but he's going to like not have any service with nothing like the bare minimum take you to the commission and that's it no a $10,000 life insurance policy is only about $20 a month I don't care if you're high risk so $10,000 at least get you married hey I want to know the name of that a what insurance I want yes that's not what I I really do I can't get it for that me too have you looked at Xander yes we looked at all of them all both yeah yall are older y'all are old it wish they would not I don't the reason this pops up is I don't cut this computer on except on Sundays I guess I need to start doing it at home okay all right now but listen just pray for the family and they've got some decisions to make about the about the U it still takes money to run the world whether we like it or not um we need to at least not be so you know brother brandham said I'm talking over here brother brandham said you know he said if you're going to get married he said and you know the Lord's coming tomorrow what'd he say do get married he said if you're planting potatoes and then you know the Lord's coming tomorrow plant potatoes I mean come on let's don't be ignorant at least have something in place where you're not a hardship cuz we all think we're going to take the body change but you know what that's a very low percentage let's just be honest so one out of Georgia huh one out of Georgia that's right one out of Georgia the rest of them very good insurance that's right what he said what he said you just got to believe you're the one he knows that that so he I'll be the one IJ yeah okay uh that's probably not not the criteria but you can believe that if you want let's just walk in the word and just remember one thing we're still human beings we still got Life to Live and we still got things we got to do so you all went through the day Ramy class you know what he says about stuff like that so y let's don't be a burden on people if we do have to yeah keep the bucket yeah so fourthly we're talking now on Temperance we started last Sunday really talking about Temperance and uh we got into some good if you weren't here last Sunday you need to listen to last Sundays cuz it was really really good how we got into uh life and that's what we were talking about because the Bible says in second Peter it says it talks about life and godliness So it's talking about your life and it's talking about being Godly in that life so that when we get up to Faith virtue knowledge when we get to temperance he says we come to Temperance now you've got faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith but watch what he says right here he says if it's the right kind of virtue it's got to be a born again Holy Ghost virtue then you add virtue to Faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now we're going to add Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop it stop drinking alcohol here either no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance now the lust of the flesh is he's talking about drinking alcohol all right but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a tler how to control your temper now it's not whether we get Sister Barbara to control her temper that's our problem right where's that it's going to be she's oh she's she's got a little she's got a little extra baggage to carry so she she she can be laid a little bit s but um not fly off on every hand don't see what talk about he's not how to control your temper now look pay attention it didn't say how to get rid of your temper that's right brother brandham never said get r R of your temper you cannot get rid of your temper that's right you're a human exactly and and brother Claude we talked this morning but he called me the other day and he's always got these little tidbits you know I love brother Claude because he can sit and do my studying for me cuz he he he's retired so he sits at home and he just goes through the internet and looks things up you know and all that stuff and then he calls me and he'll email it to me or send it to me and I'll get to use it so he's he's my study partner but he's doing all the studying but him being retired then that's great he can do that he can take his time and and do that but he said that suffering brings happiness after you think about that everything in the Bible tells about suffering but after the suffering is the happiness if you didn't suffer at all what would you be happy about right you tell me what would you be happy about if you didn't suffer there's nothing to compare now when we say suffer we don't mean laying in agonizing in pain we talking about suffering for our children right job home husband wife that's suffering but suffering brings happiness and that's exactly the truth you can't have happiness without suffering how much more the suff suffering in this world the Bible says and knowing that the happiness is coming but we got to suffer what did the Bible say we must suffer to rain he went through all the scriptures where the Bible talks about suffering look at the ten command I mean look at the Beatitudes the Beatitudes is not something that uh it's an easy thing to do so neither is temper how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you cuz see Jesus got angry there was a part of his fleshly anger that that took over when he drove those people out of the temple he drove them out brother randam said he stood and platted the rope and he in other words he thought of what he was going to do pre premeditate he premeditated it all right so realize one thing for sure as long as as we're in this thing you'll never eradicate or do away with temper it says control your temper we all get upset yes is that not temper we all get upset that's temper but it's what you do after the thing pops up is to whether you know that God has took that thing and to me it's God puts a ceiling on it a ceiling s a c e i l a ceiling puts a ceiling on it a filter you can go yeah you can only go so far when we were out in the world and did the things of the world when we flipped people off and cursed at them there was no our ceiling was not there we just said what was on our mind right but holy ghost temper Temperance puts a ceiling on it which means that you can go so far and then God starts checking you and saying hey remember he he I would say now if Jesus was here in a Corporal body I would ask him that when he was going through his trial of the Cross of the thorns and the beatings that something didn't come across him of a little bit of anger or a little bit of grief or a little bit of say he suffered didn't he he was a human mortal man right but something inside of him kept him under submission right that's right cuz he did portray the anger part that's right when he was alive he portray when he was not there at Pilot's Hall he still he portrayed the anger part when he drove those people out of the out of the temple but see when he come down to where see God took him on the mountain and adopted him said this is the person you got to be like then what happened at Calvary or the time up to Calvary it didn't do away with the human man it controlled it it controlled everything that he was he was so under control until and it wasn't that he was ever out of control but what about the man that was driving the people out of the temple well those same people were crucified him wouldn't you think if they was something different he grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible said so he grew and at Calvary he didn't get angry as far as he got angry in the temple but he said father forgive them for they know not what they're doing all right now why didn't he say that in the temple why all he had to do was say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing no he was a human mortal man but God was so much in that man that he took over what was going on in that human mortal man our spirit is not the our spirit is not the Holy Spirit that's right his Spirit was the Holy Spirit right but he still grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible said he did and being made perfect so when he went to mount Transfiguration he was being made perfect this is my beloved Son whom I please to dwell hear ye him well that's the Capstone that's the love that means that whatever Jesus went through that that human mortal man of Jesus was at a position that God could use him same way with brother brandom was he not going to kill those boys remember he would have murder been a murderer he was going to shoot those boys but then you come on later in life they persecuted him not physically but they persecuted him spiritually mentally they kicked him out of the church he had no friends well he didn't rile with him people but Paul said he said the the thing I loved about my dad was you couldn't tell who was his enemies and who was his friends they were all why he had come to a place just like we all have to come to to a place when we started in our journey we're still going to be angry we're still going to be upset we're still going to be doing things wrong but we should come to a place to where that ceiling is lower and lower everybody understand what I mean your Toleration level yes is down here not way up under she had her hand the way I'm seeing it now is um first of all the knowledge which comes below that Temperance the knowledge that you have you're not pushing what you know on people corre holding back you're tempering your desire for everybody to know right and I I think it says to train up a child in the way it should go so you're using a temperament if a child is Naughty or an enemy comes against you you have a spiritual right to control yourself you know that's the discernment and I think that yeah with the discernment that's that's why knowledge is before Temperance You' think you'd want to control your temper at the very beginning but but if you have knowledge to control that temper see that's where God comes in he gives you the knowledge that father forgive them they know not what they're do or like you said you know well this is child training or this is something we got to go through or this is you know God will show you through knowledge he'll show you what to do not a question I just remembered something brother Charlie said he said that after the constellation of angels um that when brother Randon would come down there supposedly to hunt that he didn't even want to kill animals he was so sure it was all into it was all to a place where God had took the man to to a place that uh that he was uh that he had trained brother bradam and it's not that he didn't hunt now he hunted after 1963 and killed game because he killed all them game in Africa right before he died so it wasn't just exactly lie but you come to a place to where that that's not important anymore you know to me to me I used to have I us have a bad temper did I I mean I would it would be kind of quick and then go away I never I never held a grudge did I never I don't I just don't hold grudges if you say something to me and I get a little mad I don't hold a grudge it just don't bother me a bit I don't care I really don't it's not that you don't care it's that you can handle it better cuz I can handle it better than I used to could why don't we always I know controlling your temper but it's but like the quote there it talks about not being a tadler holding your tongue I know that's a part of your temp that's a part of your temper but we always talk about controlling your temper so explain that go back to the roof is it like why do you tattle I mean I don't you don't but why people tattle they're angry at somebody I mean do you really I do when I did when I told on people I told on people cuz they did something to me most of the time something why do we all run our is that because we have because we're mad mhm I mean way down deep inside you got something do you title on something you like do you gossip about something you like no you just talk about I don't gossip about deer hunting cuz I like deer hunting but you can gossip and it be the truth yes you can so but still I have a hard time but still it makes you angry though I mean if it makes you angry whether it's truth or not I mean of us have heard the truth and got angry raise your hand Truth Hurts truth hurts what's another word for temperance would it be wisdom well wisdom is back there at for I mean at at knowledge Temperance to Temperance to me is like sister Trudy said it's you temper your thoughts or you temper your tongue you bring it to the middle of the road that's correct temper means to bring something together we're going to look up the word Temperance not today we won't have time all almost 15 after but we're going to look up the word Temperance as in what the the world calls Temperance and then we're going to bring it in to Bible Temperance because brother Brown see you can go to Temperance which means don't drink alcohol that's tempering your what your desire now see there's another thing you go to desire to me Des desire goes through all that don't you desire to have virtue yes you desire to have knowledge you desire to have Temperance it's your desire desire goes all the way up through now to me that goes back to what I said you still have a choice being a fullblown Christian just a full-fledged Holy Ghost filled person you still got a choice right desire desire is a choice right I desire to have virtue so God I'm going to just lay here and until you give me virtue what was that brother Brown said the guy said said brother said brother said I said God I'm going to lay here until you find a bag of bones do you give me the Holy Ghost you know what that kind of Desire God has to meet that because it's a desire to to worship him and not other things what our problem is is that we get this let me word my words right that we get this thing in us that we've got a and what does most of the time what does tling do what does what does tail bearing do it hurts someone else's feeling right not so much as hurts yours your tattle tailing and your jack drawing is hurting somebody else so they got to have Temperance you're trying their patience faith and all that stuff you're trying them when you when you title on or tell something that true or not true true or not mhm you're you're taking somebody up to another level because what's the first thing you do if you hear about it and even if it's true it's like Daddy you know he says don't discuss don't discuss Doctrine that's not conducive to this church in between yourself bring it to brother Dale well now it's going to get his righteous indignation up when he what hears you tling to the next person and the next person to the next and then he hears it 14th person h not first person sorry it's going to make you it's going to make your Temperance get tried right cuz he tells you what to do just like us as adults when our kids do everything we tell them to do which is 1% of the whole entire time they live maybe we're happy half a percent okay we give them a half a percent but the other 99 what does it do it tries our Temperance yes MH or hurts feelings same way with God you don't think God's Got Feelings brother brandham said the Holy Ghost was what timid now that's feelings you hurt the Holy Ghost feelings he's going to not come out of you and you become a sinner but he's going to what withdraw himself go out on the limb Prophet said and sit there and wait on you to call him by it because he's a gentleman he's very timid now being timid is a emotion well we just read God hates this he despises this love see so there's things in God that if he made us in His image then he's got the same emotions we do it's just a holy ghost emotion that never makes a mistake our emotions are human emotions that make a mistake and we got to go back and say God forgive me well he has no God to ask forgiveness to he's God and he said when he says it the first time it's always right cuz he's already got it thought out you and I are not that way but you what if we ever stop you know the old saying stop and count to 10 yeah what does that do that just don't mean just stop and count to 10 just CU you can count to 10 you have to wait till you're anger no what are you do what are they telling you to do hold on a minute pause think about it Temperance Temperance exactly what it is blind rage is not Temperance right Temperance is how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you or find out somebody's been tiing you know I can see that can you see it better now where it's it's more of if let's say take all the gossip columns out they'd be hardly any news that's right would they they'd be hardly any news take the gossip columns out while they got uh just go to Walmart and stand in line and look at all them books them true story brother talking about true story and all that People magazine what is that tail Bears gossip and they just sell and sell and sell and sell and a lot of people get mad about it but here we are with God when we go upstairs in church our life then is an open book and if brother Dale hit something or brother Jewel hit something or somebody hit something and we get angry how many times have you seen it people get angry and leave the church now that's not Holy Ghost Temperance that's your ungodly temper where we'll read in just a minute where you can't control it that's right you might get a little upset but you'll say God that was the truth that's right and you know what then like he said the sorrow comes before happiness you get your hide burnt but you know what God's only going to chasen his children he's not going to chase Chas the devil's kids he's only going to chasen his own children so if you get chasen by God and you realize that it's for your own good and you say Thank You Lord then what more happiness is that God has come to you and said hey you need to work on this that's right and I've come and brought somebody to tell you that and I have made it aware in your spirit that you're supposed to change and you've acted right right now see that puts all that together I want to find out how they temp for steel because there's something there's something that they do to the metal to make it stronger yes and so how they burn it they heat it they heat it fiery TRS eat it and they beat it that's what the Bible says they beat it they do they beat it yep that's like the draw of the gold to get the shiny gold out you actually have to before they come up with the smelting process C of melting it the man would sit there and beat it with a hammer and what did it do it it throwed all the junk off of the off of the Nugget but when you got finished the Nugget cost more cuz it didn't have all the impurities in it so we're Tried by fire as the Bible says right coming out is pure gold all right so that's what I mean about a Temperance what more to see that that let me just give you an example and Terence doesn't mind me tell telling you he told me one time so I guess I can tell him because it's it's true he didn't like to wash black people's feet for a long time he was a little bit Prejudice he told me this had a hard time with it didn't do it avoided it and then God brought it to his attention one day through something I don't know what it was and that changed his whole attitude of that well you know what that's God telling his child you're acting up do better and he did see if he wasn't a child God can still come and tell you things this little thing that comes on in your in your psyche of your of yourself that says you shouldn't do that well now you can override that and going to do it again that's where brother Brown said the Holy Ghost then you don't get a lot of you don't get a life-changing experience when you come up to Temperance if you don't allow God to get rid of that thing for you or at least not get rid of it I'm sorry to cover it or to lessen it I mean we get angry every day yes don't we at something even our own self we get angry you know we lose our car keys or something well who do you get angry you get angry with yourself but you know what yes it's okay that well I didn't mean that for Joy actually minut it for Trudy but Jo you're in that category too if that's the case I stay angry but to me well yeah this is an epidemic but you can be too much the other way where you're not tempered that's right that's correct you've got to be tempered to the middle correct way what to be tempered to the middle is is put your car keys in one place Jo pray for me well hey we've got an epidemic here these two right here do the same thing Fredo call a 100 times out of 100 she'll say I L my I left my insulin I left my insulin where's my foot but but listen what we do with that now see if we become so callous to that and say well that doesn't matter well it does cuz it keeps you aggravated all the time you need to put forth an effort to put the things where they need to go everybody doesn't have a Danny fountain that hands me the keys and says here gece is going to need these you know I mean and it wasn't an hour after we got where we were going that Joy wasn't coming ask me she sent hope mama can't find her keys don't you have the extra step dad gave me gave you just one that was one time that's enough for me but it happens still does I'm beginning to feel like you're ignoring this black person here this is long time ago that she said this H I'm going to say what I got to say okay Joy said what's what's another word for temperance M another word for temperance is Faith virtue knowledge and just like together right just like when we get to patience another word for that is Faith virtue knowledge and Temperance good girl you do show up cuz I was thinking Temperance really is a virtue you do show up for some reason that's good sister my arm just broke also in their quote somewhere where brother Brandon he skips Temperance and he says faith virtue wisdom don't he do that yeah somewhere I mean you know wisdom you need that for you had to have all underneath cuz if you went up the ladder and down here you can't get up here yeah says it goes this way too right that is correct the I wish we could do it where the marks were going this way and you needed Faith all the way up and viral all the way up oh well but have you ever has anybody ever had a bad temper and realized that it was over the way you used to be that's the way I want to say see Dad did too remember when the guy SLA Daddy see that God's going to well see there's the suffering suffering brings happiness he had to suffer through a slap in the face but what did he do the next what did he do 5 minutes after afterwards God brought to his brain that's over with and he rejoiced because that was over with cuz you know that's a hard thing for some people yeah let somebody slap you you know what would you do right now you said well I know what I do well do you because you know what brother Brown said God will try these things to show you where you're at at brother said you can be anywhere you know anywhere with God at any time you will know that that's like Claude was saying the other day you know where you're at with God you know you still got a temper there somewhere that's right you know and you know what somewhere it's going to manifest in front of somebody as a witness and then you're going to say God I need to work on that I am not where I should be but let's read a few more of these before we just one more minute and these things excuse me boy a lot of us is going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in this Church doing Miracles and things that they used to do yes sir you know why because the book of Acts had these virtues working in their life that's what we lost down through the church ages and brother Ram come not to just restore that he came to bring us back to the faith of the fathers but to take us on in a Rapture so if you want to say from 1947 to 1963 which this was in 62 he comes to the Statue of a perfect man and and I'm I'm to the point to where I can say that from 47 to 63 he brought us back to what the book of Acts had but it was only in brother random at that time partially in other people all right partially and other people but brother random came to a Capstone to where God sealed these things in it took him from 47 to 63 God leading him through so don't think we're going to get it overnight it's going to be a work in progress a WIP but add these things add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer and kindness when wrath is spoken to you somebody says you bunch of ho RS down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves cuz see he saw that in Pentecost they he said he have the um Temperance to fight a or temper to fight a buzz St right but speak in tongues and go to church and say you got hold don't jump up roll if your sleeve now see not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says amen when you're riled up R not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones to bread he could have done it and showed he was God see you could do it show your God that's what daddy's talking about growing up into this place to where you we come to the third pole to where the third pole is going to be made manifest the third pole is not going to be made manifest in a baby cuz they don't know how to handle it it's like giving a car it's giving the keys to uh Jonas to a jet rocket it' be a disaster that's right but now train him up for 25 years let him be about 28 years old 26 years old then give him the keys he knows what to do with it he could he won't be a disaster with it well that's the same way with God that's right if he gives us the keys now to the kingdom like this he gives us the keys we could be we' be a disaster right we'd hurt feelings we'd do all these things wrong we would zap our boss out of existence that's right first thing we do my daughter-in-law or our spouse or a daughter-in-law see there so you got a Temperance problem right there no she has helped me get it when they call you Bells him but he said I'll forgive you for that keep going can you do that can you can you love your in-laws as much as you love your own I'm all right let's go work hard hard you know what prayer prayer is where the answer comes from huh problem that's the problem she's working on that's correct we all got our own problems that's the problem fre working on wait you know when in culinary you cook in a cream sauce right you have to temper in the cream okay for the which means you stir it in but you have to do it slowly
