us and deliver us from our destruction God are we knowing that whatever you say God is true now and Lord is left for us to believe it in to walk there in God we ask you for everyone for every problem to have a need in their hearts about it because your deliverer which you remember those in the Sunday School classes father that the small minds will grow to be strong and be a part of the stone but we ask you to bless brother brave this morning as he prepares to bring unto us the words that you have given unto him and we thank your name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen some 89 I was seeing the mercies of the Lord forever with my mouth where I make known that faithfulness to our generations I have made it covenant with my chosen I have sworn unto David my servant and the heavens are praise that one is a Lord thy faithfulness and also in the congregation of the Saints [Music] God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Saints and to be had in reverence to all them that are

founded them [Music] thou has the Madeon strong as our hand and high is their right hands this gives the people that know the jaws of sound they shall walk Oh Lord in the light of that he's alright I

Brady with us young brother oh yeah brother Boyd's class is supposed to sing fart part of it before you know after the morning service all right then the adults he said is to be after the evening service all right then it's just a Monaco's class is to be before the service so they can figure that out one of them 12 14 dozen 1250 they can do their figuring out how they're going to handle that non like that because they can take care of all right let's just sing we're glad to have brother Brady with us from Jamaica he's been here before many times we always say to him welcome the Lord would bless him and and bless us because that's the one thing we believe in the fivefold ministry I believe that's the way I've said it in this morning I don't go along with all of this stuff about you know we're supposed to play tapes now and the fivefold ministry don't weigh with I warned another who got the authority to say that because I'll show you where the Bible says it is to continue and I'll show you where the Prophet says is to continue children you can do what you want to want your time I believe the way we here is by the fivefold ministry don't fight cometh by hearing hearing by the word of the Lord let's just sing that under the motor open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my [Music] I if you go power and love [Music] your glory [Music] me [Music] elderly if you want you could be seated for gesture we love to greet each and everyone in the precious name again the Lord Jesus Christ just still alive and well amongst people doing what he promised and fulfilling his word amen and I'm so grateful to see some that maybe for the first time email let's make it plain it's not my first time here today Matt and I each time I come I just feel welcome and everything just just right rest I'll write like a crystal anyway and so sometimes at home we all seem likely rest enough and here there and everywhere so sometimes when I come and can come here and things like that get rest up get feed up get such a lot some weight and I believe since I come I began to gain them back a man believe the Lord is really doing something in this last days in the church back home still going on amen and we hope to go on for till the rapture yeah that's what we are waiting on then I'm great change is a spoken word of God I mean there is going to be rubber as a body a man just calling pudding pudding pudding right a man not believe this something to put in and that one I believe it's got more power so it won't be too long amen the great eternal change will come on and I'm looking for it because it's promised by Jesus Christ amen and every one of God's promise will be fulfilled in the natural I'm just getting to hate this body man hey man I think I said that my last Sunday in church I said I don't like college and I don't like I don't believe you God really feel bad when I say that amen I have a lot of things to do and you sold me back and for the Lord and for myself amen it means and that it comes you know you have to have money if some of us don't worry the insurance and things like that so we feel it on every side remember gives a great promise and it's not too far to be manifested is that right Amy want the only Disney move I could pull out my fast it won't need them you want you know walking stick again to help us and it's kind of mad at me amen and I'm looking forward a man for that promise to be fulfilled and we are Abraham's children and thinking that happen to Abraham not to us is that right amen but knowing that it was full filled like sometimes the river Branum puts it and sage and knowing that is supposed to happen to us - amen that theophany is calling me amen and I believe amen I'm answering right is that right like those there in Revelation hold on hold on is that right somebody asked my question about that amen to be fulfilled he meant come a day without us I will not be made every person that right right that's what it scripture said day we don't owe so we bit a shaper amen it is because they're having that feeling also oh but it shall be come on we'll fill praise the Lord man I believe if I was at home I would be right at the pulpit at this very moment and things like that so I'm not really scared or anything like that because I would be home doing the same fear amen let us see the warm faces and the smiles and things like that and everywhere too so we learned that and we understand it and so each time I see my precious friend got a Dale and remember couple years ago a man I met him first I know that there was something you think that I want to pull oh I remember to better keep that your brother Keith let's plan of service because that man has got something for us amen but I see my church and his church something like that and let's see people get all little groups together because that man I've got something to tell us amen and I believe if Amanda was the holy spirit doing that I always say that and so we are happy to know we are still in that word Phyllis amen there's so many things going around Oh that breaks our heart and sometimes way back there we hear of names that follow better than a message for 40 years amen and then I don't know because when you leave this where can you go and but that's a part of it it's got to be that way I Drive amen it's got to be that way with a Julia saw this or that you thought right and you had to sit there on to his time come on but the bottom set is going to be three kinds of believers is that right amen so my all will come for the rapture somebody else our will come just like Pharaoh email just like Judas amen because it's the Prophet puts it down in this world so I don't really get drunk or anything like that come back up and good friend of mine from Trinidad creatures lives in the States and didn't seem for a couple years and things like that but italic was the phrase Lord and things like that then he shot attorneys to God's a mean I sit and listen amen because I know the Bible said what the Bible said Yero Ezra the Lord your God is one God have to have a revelation for that I remember when the revelation King to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I was sitting in my Church of God that first baptism father son Holy Ghost but when I heard Amen that you got to be baptized in name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know that there was something really a man but couple of us and start to pray pray pray pray God still I'm surprised and standing here every time I remember that Macedonia call Hansard and we get together when service over and night something like that night services and we stare on that flat concrete cold and things like that not like overhearing hope but we stay there all night and we pray Lord send somebody send somebody so I know what Matty Donna called done for me when I read a Bible and what those preachers was saying was so far off amen and then we began to pray God unsuppressed send brother green over Amen I remember that Sunday morning just like this they really stayed here and for the first time what many ministries minister is going to be around that area and I remember it came out just like all your sit down their church was just the same maybe same amount of people at the time and he was just looking and looking and looking and he said if you are going to start start right because if you don't start right you won't in right didn't even know what it was to say same but the perfect cook came and he took his message and we going to preach a Matt and baptism and I like her I may say they were ready here but I just say it again come maybe somebody wasn't here a mentor now Holy God's Word is when you hunger for God Alleluia can he keep looking looking and he said if you're going to start start right another time there was in Jamaica a group going around Black Power Group Lynette there was over here I never said they were trying to get a young ones say don't worry King James Version because these white this was just written for white people and some people caught on to it oh we thought is strange and so when you begun to talk about the baptism and things like that Amen and bring them scriptures and so forth but the green will go as far as you can just like a bullet out of a gun and you gotta ride fast and we try to get some of the Scriptures done because we talk he took her some kind of American baggage that we didn't have but we went over and we took Oh a bad thing four of us and we begun to search the Scriptures Jesus's surface scriptures amen we began to fulfill that script ribbon on a search and we found though that is same Bible he was preaching the same Bible been reading for years but we never heard anything about that never see them scriptures I was on the schoolteacher but I've never seen that he got to be baptized Jesus name and so we decided to get baptized so one of the reading said we'd have to tell the pastor so he decided to go so he went on he totally passive pastor we just love you and he was a gifted man pray for the sick and you couldn't deny we love him real real real pastor good pasta when he goes off the word dance and so he said he can do it he's not going to do it so he said we can ask brother Hannah greeny people dirty say yes so we asked and he said yes he will do it just have copied ate on the island and so we trying to work fast as you could can we taught you to be alright so we stayed up again all night actually Saturday night and we're going to go to the ocean to get baptized and so I'm sure we talk and we talk and we go over back being Scriptures use a truck by baptized in Jesus name when God the common man and I think I read them things that someone good to us and so decide we've been to take a nap and I don't know they got up before I got up and said are you going but a Brady has hidden no sir you've all gone I do it another time tobacco are they winter and get by the Green River was staying there in his house and they went on down to the ocean and I went back to sleep could be a vision or a dream and it mixed up with that sometimes and I saw like a white woman all dressed in way and things like that and in that little dream I call it I was going this way and she was coming to me this way on the beach white sand and she had on white tears no and as we come together just like that she said are we going to baptize this morning I said no man no man and she said it three times and I said no man and I woke up and I could hear of all I said no man and I look around in the room and I didn't see them and then it comes back to me that we also go together so I just get some clothes and I run two miles they have ready been baptized was coming back I say you take me down and so it happened that way and so from there I started father spray it up and a man honest I used to go to the Baptist Church where I used to work couple of us there and there's a Sunday off and things like that it was go but I couldn't take in those doctrine just sit there so definitely I never really wanted to join any church I wanted God in my soul I wanted the real God in my soul and that's how they be going to pray and we get hungry for God and fasting and praying and things like that and then it's happened hey man they turn us over to church we didn't know where to go because we didn't know any Pentecostal Church at things like that so we start to preach on the street and so forth and they thought it strange but we see God in His Word and we try to stay with it we go in further still praying still praying still praying this is 9 to 6 6 to 1 for the green came to Jamaica 6 to 2 he gave me an invitation to the United States went and I got my visa was another brother but brown and so forth he knew about but abandoned but I didn't know him or anything like that he was a bishop the Pentecostal church was here and sober both of us came over here and it was so strange when I come because maybe holidays are life is you see black people black people I was working for white anyhow so I kind of have a little knowledge about the way but when I came here it was so different very mad and I'm just still in my testimony Loretta's hotel were here and then he said but a brady brother branham is going to be in Southern Pines but Papa Thomas Church and so he said we are going over there and he took me and brother Brown over there and I want to tell you church for the first time I've heard about billig Ryan heard about shaggers heard about all the Evangelist great vandalism for America in those days and so forth and things like that but I've never heard read the band he's a good magazines from the Church of God and things like that and so that morning was a special morning as I said I've never heard of his name never nice at there and brother Brown we open the front and when that man walked out from that little room he would come to the puppy just like this and he said good morning friends there is some feelings quite different first I'm going to sing and I just look at him and I know I've been reading the book of Acts and I said that's the church I want to be there got to be a church like that I always say that visit churches and churches but I said I don't know but when I read the book of Acts I said Dutch Church it got to be on her its own area I will not see that man for the first time walk OH I said that's the man I remember he said start we said there is some people going around and said the coming of the Lord is already happened they are in the Millennium didn't know too much about those things but I like to tell them the coming of the Lord is different said this is the appearing of the Lord he's appearing now but the coming is different I heard him say that brother Brown because a seen a preacher seen a bishop and things like that they know it's all their bishops he said give me system and he said after but a parent looks straight over where I was sitting and he said said those things he said brother Brady we have a group from America have them at home for all week and as a doctrine day was putting down and things like that but I just believe what better balancing the coming of the Lord is different from the appearing and he said that still I don't know anything about brother Branham or anything like that but when the prayer line came I saw the way he operated and God was so good the church I was visiting and Charlotte or inhibits until somewhere here there was a sister in there wanted a child for couple years after marriage and Jim told 11 year she said and better Bannon pointed her out and said go home get everything for your baby son this way and I kept up with but the green and he said you shopping I came back but did a little shot this morning right I got married in 1963 and I came back in 1965 this takes a second time when I came back the second time I didn't have any books I didn't have any case of brother branham I've never written to him either I just go back to my church home and I try to tell them what I saw and that's it right that's a nice going to be hard to straighten up everything but it happens I leave my wife I the work place we work for the same people and when I left she was pretty out at work and I got a letter about Wednesday from her said she wished her tooth feet swollen she had to go to the doctor and the doctor said is very serious she must go straight to bed with medication and things like that she got her mother to work for her at that time she said I have some preacher to pray for me I was there but a green I read the letter I want to leave same time to go back to Jamaica and things like that but I didn't say one thing didn't say nothing Saturday evening brother Jerry roll from Charlotte he's dead now and drove up to buy the greens home and he said but a green heard it but rounds going to be in his tabernacle I'm trying to get as much people to go that would you could you make it better Green said no not at this time that's Sunday and then he said red abraded allowed to go I said yo you gotta ask where the green because I he was one I was staying away and so forth so better Green said sure better Brady you can go ruler Jerry he said but already I will be back after service in Charlotte and I come and get you here and then we take off we are not going to reach there until about 10:00 o'clock Saturday America is not Jamaica he said I'm going to stop at different ministers and have fellowship and then like 10 o'clock Saturday morning we get there and so it happened just that way we got into Jeff or him maybe many times he went anywhere cool we got there and he called up Jonah Jackson and maybe his church at the time of the house turret or something like that there were rooms upstairs so he asked if we could stay there for holidays and better Joyner Jackson told him yes so we went upstairs and a little rest is long drive and things like that different country didn't know if I was going he's I didn't know what I was going with anyway when I get there and we get upstairs and I mean somewhere else he said brother Brady let's drive around by the band's home and you said he could be dear you said if he is there I'm going to stop and then you just walk straight in receive you will greet you right I found it kind of strange funny if he's going to take me right I thought we would go footing food to discuss yes but I said how could I meet this man understand me I don't know how the beauty man things like that strange country strange people and so forth so we drove around the house he wasn't there he said sometimes you like to cut his mouth grass himself or wash his own car it wasn't there said let's drive around the church drove around the church he wasn't there we did that two times the third time I said better ro-beast him in the morning then I go to church and so I still didn't tell him I have a letter through my wife wrote so I said I need a little rest you know long drive and so forth things like that so he said all right all right we got up pretty early both four o'clock in the morning and he said brother Brady we gotta go you know no I said where is the church said four o'clock in the morning he says yeah schibetta Brady you may not understand when better bottom is in his Tabernacle to sleep from all over the world right so I gave it a safe hora remember it drink a cup of coffee and say let's go we go when I went there it was a little roof here a little over here little groupie arrived all I could hear the Prophet say and the prophets and the prophets say try to listen this way prophets say oh we're little crew we waited until the church could be go 8:30 see the people walking down so I walk with you let me get off near near near to the door until we heard like somebody's inside then finally the door open when it were open Oh Lord right so they rush like I would say back there I didn't know why people get rough sometimes we taught him so soft ever for them but the way they react should go through that door but a rolling sliding a little bit and when I got to make it I could make it cut the door was just crowned and I didn't want to push and Russian squeeze anybody cuz I was going like that fearful and see if it was home I know I would just and I slide one of these times and I just get up his right side by the ropes and who my heart is but I don't know if I squeeze anybody or things like that trying to look over my shoulder to see anybody and things like that so anyway everything was alright I took the letter when I was going this time it is my coat pocket and to happen again when that man come from that door come to the pulpit something different and he will be looking just like this and when it said is here again there's a holy horse there's a different feeling come over the whole place if you drop a pin you could hear it I know something funny was you understand but I don't understand it and it will be just looking looking just like that the any City is here since when he said he is here is another feeling full Oh Lord and he would just look then he would exalt and then he would go straight to the words that morning he preached the anointed ones in the end times I could not understand because I already get mixed up with Pentecost no no and he was just laying it in line straight we regard straight where the god I taught you those who and you filled with the Holy Ghost you know Pentecost and how didn't understand he dismissed and said healing service is going to pray for the sick and I took the liturgy and my wife wrote and I had it in my coat pocket and he's the same problem to get in but when you're getting is working nice out there I came out again and do the same thing same feeling come over and then I stood there not many white people not many black people to service right good understand what was going on in a strange country and then he took his takes and I could follow him from the first word to the last word I was talking about that little group oh that was right at that little bruh according to what the Prophet prophesied Jackie right behold Zion your king come riding in and the emotions Oh hallelujah I could see that group I know I was in that group hallelujah your king riding at the prophet said on

at a person then I meet preachers or any bishops right and he was there calling out people calling out people all of a sudden is has it my highest rate and I did that the end by the road and he called somebody ourselves and I keep my eyes on him and again is as if my eyes again straight and when he died in my eyes he said he has a column and says here I can see many waters he's not from here he's from Jamaica I had this thing in my I know we are on Brown I've never never written him a little never you believe that this is it and it's all written here Church a man I can't deny this message

America but is to make every like Africa I'll tell you he does it amen and if you have a little daughter you call it out and if it's your name you cannot deny your name and then I knew that even I

problem with those legs we live in testimony to those things you know we love the message been better been I'm said that came on sit down back and it's like I could hear the devil said don't believe

the wings of a snow-white don't be a very dead you fulfilment of his message oh I don't know how people could miss him as a prophet hallelujah when do you read that if you never read it please go read it again all the things that he said and the message was just his message and his life was wrapped up hidden in that message somebody was talking one time said they were this but Brandon walk about three times often come back and sing that little song till we meet again or something like that but you think that same shock sometimes whenever or you know operate like that you know somebody somebody going we will just pick that up at somebody going right god is good god is good I remember how was it for the green not Stan Church and that night all the children his children was there married with their husbands and something tells me to say ok and when I said because I knew what was going to take place it was a sick or anything but I said I think there still is a Satan it's kind of hard so when I come back it's going to be so different and I could just walk down until him said if when I come back here you won't be alive you'll be in a grave that's better green ok that was in August I believe and have at home one morning I got up I need a battery for my delivery truck he sent a retro from a pickle and by the battery then did wasn't good and I got up that morning I was looking straight to the blue sea just across and I was about to ride and get better going I hope you'd help me get a battery for this thing ok just and I started right there okay her divorce and heard these words and he's seen him no more he come back to me and put the pin down on the paper just like that nice little girl little after I got a telegram no community clinic my wife she and the nurse

telegram come with a great pass away and I was saying it I told him I did drop the letter skin she later posted it on everything and I came up and I was right sometimes the post box I could go to the post box and I wanted was to retrieve that letter but I didn't get to exclude somebody else took it rather than I believe or somebody right that I was asking for some help to buy this battery funeral and things like that better than say better really is still going to do it but I want to give God thanks for the messenger that God sent to us on this day and I don't see no devil in here can get me to deny it [Applause] there is no devil no power from hill to get me did you know I want to say this plane I've seen more light snow on some of the messages that better Brannen preach sometimes I go to a whole book of that hope net see so much I made a line onto this and I made a line on to that verse and I need a line all I have to do is Mark it again with another color the message is more to me today than yesterday the message that brother Branham brought is more to me today there's a brighter light when I pick up one of them books and begun to read and I'm walking in that eternal light that comes from the message and the to messenger and I'm not looking for another messenger hallelujah to the Gentile God has sent his messenger Malachi four and five or if we could only understand what God has been doing there's no way Amen to leave this message this message is a proving don't hate God maybe stand we got some scriptures they can preach for itself and if you have your Bibles here let's turn to Matthew chapter st. can sit match it in wanna put it you love the Lord you want to read from verse five here verse seven these twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not us but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of God Lackey's of heaven is at hand every boy has eternal God we thank you for your spoken word we thank you for the revelation Lord God as it carries a meant to these individual that you have hallelujah have in mind hallelujah and again as we look at it Lord we are depending on you again Lord to do it again reveal the glorious revelation that's hidden in these words Lord you've been doing that hiding yourself gay men in flesh and still we discern that it's you all the time and we want to give your tongues may you do it again in Jesus name you can be cheeky revelation 19 verse 7 mercy let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the same this is the word of the Lord I believe we all believe the word of the Lord came l want to give God thanks amen and I wonder maybe I read this last time I just wander fallacy again we are living church when it comes to the revelation of the Word of God this little Gentile bride gay men getting herself ready is that right and this is from Tommy Osbourne one to preach brother Branham right memorial service and I picked this up and I ever wanted to meet him I don't know if he still alive but I really wanted was to meet him in the last time because he said something that I would say and he said this was the closing revelation something had to happen it couldn't go as past regulate generations and God this one is it like it there for in God's divine mercy somehow stepping beyond the bound of ordinary measure he had four ordained at this hour to send again this prophet some are going to think I am suffragists are off doctrinally and it doesn't really matter but God came again I like that word again in human flesh and said apparently i'ma show them again I must remind them again they must see one more time once again they must know what God is like and he stepped down and sent a little man a prophet but more than a prophet this time Jesus man this time Elijah was not there this which we have beheld is more than Moses was not that for because of the different dispensation in which he lived it couldn't be what we have seen more than that a Jesus man a man full of God but sent as a special sign to a generation a generation supernatural sign an extraordinary measure why it was done before why do it again to assure this last generation once more to be the poor runner once more to be sure the record is clean hallelujah once more to be sure that is no excuse and to be sure that God has demonstrated afresh to be sure there can be no mistake and to be sure that we are reminded afresh of what God is like how Jesus was and what God but get this now doesn't flesh to be sure that this generation charged with bringing back the king would know without question what it must be like what the work must be to do and what the minister must be so we would not even know what our mission is to perform what our witness is how we are to perform and execute it what we are to do and how we are to up once more to be without excuse beyond measure to be before runner-up is second coming get this now I like it the first night I ever heard and saw brother Branham didn't have any fear to say Minister I didn't hear a voice I didn't know that it had been said of him and I didn't know that the voice from heaven had spoken these words I knew nothing of that I had not been with any of the ministers that believed in him for most of those that I was with did not believe in him but like a voice and yet not like a voice I heard it I knew it it came to me have done the Baptist was sent as the forerunner of his first coming William Branham is sent as a forerunner of his second coming I know that I was on inexperienced young preacher like myself I like to put myself I was not a corrosion like myself I did not know the scripture why I knew this I do not know but I knew it I said thank God he cross my path thank God I learned thank God I caught on it did not take ten nights only one night hallelujah this generation seeks a sign another sign and another one and still another one one is enough for the bride if you're not the bride you're waiting for a hundred but if you're the bride one time Oh hallelujah is that I caught on it did not take ten nights only one time this generation see cosine and another and another and still amen one is enough is that right this generation must be without excuse for unto this generation he's committed the task to do this so he sent forth a particle particle human is that rightly that this generation must be without excuse alike that he sent forth particle human better surrounded by supernatural science to attract attention and to make this way war generation Luka ponder search and think thus the halo of light that appeared at his birth the star the angel the discernment the gifts all of these were given for that purpose hallelujah I didn't hide it to show us God again keep that in your heart to show for God again to repeat what he showed us in Jesus Christ when he came in the form of flesh and to remind us one final time like Jesus brother Branham read Eman straited the very thing which made men believe that the true Messiah has come he was a seer he saw he lived in both worlds the seen and the unseen at the same time translate both of them practically all the time jesus said My father worketh here too and I work the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father here comes brother Branham along in the 20th century wonder which one you're living in and does exactly the same way God in the flesh again crossing our path exactly the same way think of that many did not no they would not have known him if they would have been here when God crossed their path in their body they called Jesus Christ get this now people have not changed those who questioned then get it the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father doing for watching so every do it these also does the son likewise for the father loveth the son and show him all thing I want to say amen to that and I want to say church as he said he was inexperienced amen but God knows how to get you is that right and in this revelation as he speaks right we believe that we are living in the end time we believe that we are not living at the beginning of the book neither the middle of the book God allows his word to every age and then he comes down on the theme in each age and interpret his world and brings it to pass if the world is supposed to be updated he called in the right time whether you want to believe because if you are not a believer you can't believe don't care what and how long your father is you just follow it long enough until the final message comes unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you ain't got any life Oh God God knows all things is that right from 70 to maybe come down to right the least that how we'll have to return I'm not too shocked if I hear certain certainty believe the message maybe one time I would carry pick up there Moses and Pharaoh is that guy Johnny's and Jumblies it's time for us to fit up these things back because it's got to happen again a mess but Church does that he foreknew those that he was that he predestinate hallelujah you are going to walk with Him until the rapture the marriage of the lamb is come here after we say it over time because there was a special special waiting do that and we stayed over the marriage of the lamb is come for the bride is that right oh it's more than sometimes oh we look at it as we're banham explained it for us oh really did it if you are one of them we are now living in the closing scene of this world history you are living in the back of the book believing that God is fulfilling and time prophecy oh I wish sometimes they would go back and pick up the books that bit about him they put his messaging right I believe some of them would fit I know who they are they always hear church when we must know who we are God Jesus knew who write would betray him and it's only take a certain message to know if you are the bride and when that message comes along then you have to fulfill your portion in the words of the Almighty God because it's already spoken and so shall it be happily the bride is already married miss Jesus mrs. Jesus not going to be married the marriage of the lamb is and in that wedding last year after the marriage every car lined up there's another portion to be fulfilled it is later don't repeat hallelujah to the lamb you understand let me took off follow them Lord is that right and wine and chicken goodies hallelujah I want the whole power of the road we are because the marriage is already gone what about the other brother Oh buddy Joe we took off for the goodies hallelujah I believe you're right that little please and if you're not married is that right I don't think you're able to go for the other part of the fulfillment of DOS see God Jesus said to them the next time we meet we'll have communion again I'll finish one portion some people don't even start yet you know but we finish one portion the bride we are heading no today watch this supper you don't go to the supper first you have to be married this was the very well one husband you marry the exes union mistress green yet sure smile laugh you can't it happen look I was there as a witness this is Jesus Oh Lord the next time we eat again the interdigital the Oh to fulfill three and a half years whoa hallelujah amen if we can just fold a better banner line upon line precept upon precept he's not outta line yet for me he's right in line with the scripture and the scripture must be fulfilled every word church must be full fear hey man let me that's got a shot won't be long amen in the 50 moments Liara you rate of 15 more minutes hey man you know inexperienced preacher and I was as but husband said I was too but I really booked and I see something's in there right got no preachers preaching I stumbled over them Lord but it's good to say simplicity you treasure God at that time if the women don't have on a hat right they can take communion they can preach if a singer walk up to be prayed for a woman and she go up on a hat you have to get somebody cursive or somebody and tired of it one day I was reading the Bible right there in Corinthians when Paul says her here is given to her for a covering that was good enough for me hallelujah I said this is the sick Lord whoa oh god help us a mess one day I heard 1933 your 3ds I wasn't there as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so your mouth is real that's good enough for me I didn't have to listen to another message tl husband said the first night one message he heard was good enough a second emotion when he was right however he was black in experience preacher was just ready from the book you just say no to stress out he's a goon you go to the Gentile neither the Samaritan but a man is the first person opened my understanding spiritual there is only three classes of people on the world in the world whether you're black whether you pink where are you white whether you're yellow three glasses you see what is he saying Oh God I don't never hear them creature any other preacher all of them things and then I said I don't understand you mean Jesus Kelly sighs I don't go and they are human beings these Gentiles the Samaritans oh I can understand that to understand when I came to the United States first right I didn't see one college maybe Church in New York would burn white with the revelation God put in my heart just like policy where is my people it's not only White's going to heaven thank God brother can god sister you're on the right road to glory I can't turn back revelation from God's Word I am the bride when I was in the Church of God I've seen Lord I want to be a bride don't know about me but there was a son I want to be a bride I want to be a bride and didn't know what bride really need but I know no don't you go he just give orders so what been among Jesus is huh no didn't know that he had us in the back of his mind the purse shall be last and the last shall be reverse inexperienced preacher and God but the scripture says he must needs go to Samaria do you know totally the service under said Samaria you're not a story right an event you're the right time timing is supposed to he's launched listen he said go get your lunch my lunch hate something different well we've been feeding on the polymer of this column on some time to make brother branham the son of man but the brothers not notes disowned a man he is ah son of a-- and not a word of God the Son of man is Jesus Christ Oh [Applause] do you love it not knowing he's going to get them himself the Prophet said write the first bride fail the second bride faith but this Gentile bride cannot fail is that right and I began to smile he didn't leave me out a man away to glory pick by Jesus crash no girl in earth can stop me he wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life he wrote your day so you block white pink free classes and he come and get us Oh Lord I was going through this morning when I saw the big fuss then they're heathens and again another scripture here and see it's lying upon your true oh I love the world huh you love the word Oh Lord but how are we are living in I'm trying to go through the scripture here and see you know how red ranim explain these things this is the Gentiles time the Jews knows it they're trying to get everything because a man I believe there's going to be another war they call it they have to clear them people of this part and I don't believe man can do that God is going to do it United clear one time if you go to the first war and they gave it back to to them is that right but it will have to be cleared again them to build their temple trying to get everything that was in the whole temple back understand I read little this little lot about them but sometime last year I saw in our paper even they couldn't get that red effort do you know the God is here in America and the ship it don't and it was accepted two generations are trying to get a read ever and they got it here in America sent to the callee and they proved it an amen because they have to set back their their church but he don't deals with his two at the same time I am glad for that I am one of them by the world I ministered or scriptures began to show up and to prove who he was and who he still is a man look close here God alots his word to every age and then he comes on the scene in each age and interpret his word and bring it to pass we are now living in the closing scene of this world history we are living in the back of the book is that right God is like a great contractor he lays out his materials when we tested he doesn't go ahead and start and wonder we are going to get the roof in where I'm going to get this on that for the building when they were building that whole table on out of there did you know they were said not even the sound of a saw Oh hallelujah not in the song and they collected things all over the world that's in the natural so in the spirit Paulo egg here from America but we have been collected and it's going to fit the pyramid is going to be capped and everything is going to be fit they went all over the world and they collect the lumber they collects everything for that time temple and God has been collecting his and can God you send somebody from America
