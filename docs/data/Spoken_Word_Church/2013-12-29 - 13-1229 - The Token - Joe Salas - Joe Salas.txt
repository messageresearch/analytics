okay good morning good morning brother anderson said he's got the best today so yeah brother boy's got the flu jeffrey's got the blue so today i want to continue my talk on that token so open your bibles to chapter 12 and verse 12 and 13. what exodus 12 verse 12 13. i said for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and i will smite all that firstborn the land of egypt that both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt and i will execute judgment i am the lord the blood shall be unto you for token upon the houses where you are when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plagues shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt but god called moses he told and go tell pharaoh does say the god of the hebrews let my people go if you won't let them go throw down your stick and it will become a serpent and if you won't believe the first sign then do this other side i'm just kind of backing up a little bit uh the message uh take the rod and get other people 1950 brother said the rod that moses had in his hand was not the rod of moses it was the rod of god god's judgment that moses held it over egypt and flies came and it brought judgment upon a disobedient people and the rod was christ the substitute for sin and sickness let me read a little something about the pharaohs it said that ancient egyptians believed that the pharaoh was a living god the affair had pharaoh had total authority he was in charge of the army treasury justice and in egypt they said to help the pharaohs rule they were many government officials and scribes ramses ii reigned for 67 years how do you like to have a president for them for that long oh my lord and the message the token february 1964 brother brown said he said the life was going on from the sacrifice and now the blood was a token his orders had been carried out that's that's what it was in egypt that dreadful night just before that struck the last plague god had shown his great signs and wonders in egypt he's known suffering kindness to pharaoh and all of his people he has sent many great signs through the land he sent them a prophet show them signs and wander the bill of fire all and all that that he had that he did and yet all that he did yet they would not repent they would not come to god they ignore all of his signs they ignored his prophet they ignored the message they wanted their own ways so god had been fed up with them so he said i'm going to make a separation now between those who do believe and those who do not believe he said i think we're living in that time now where god is making a choice men will believe or they won't believe amen all you got to do is look in the world and see what's going on and god required token and this person innocent land that he has substituted for dead in the garden of eden and now when the lamb was killed the blood was to be placed upon the door post and on the bento and it was to show that their requirement had been carried out i think that's a great lesson for us we look at it see they believe in worship as he identified by the token of their blood he had to the believer had to get the lamb slave the lamb a land for a house take the blood the history which is just that little brush that grows up there in the country and they come and wheeze and recall it and have to apply it show it by applying it out of the blood which the heads his hyssop represents faith but you guys should be bad i'm not going to use faith as a kingdom okay just check many times people think they have to to have us some supernatural faith to be a believer it isn't the hyssop speaks for that just coming weeds that you could get it anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood and apply the blood see the blood tonight is applied by this by simple faith just not nothing supernatural it's right around you everywhere just simply like a child reach out and get a hold of it and apply that blood the hyssop is just a simple child faith for the believer it isn't something out of your reach you don't have to reach very far to get it that history grows and that country goes out of the cracks of the walls a little kind of diamond shaped leaf you can pick it up anywhere just as a grass or whis would be in the country here now just pick it up apply it put it in the door that's the way faith is to be applied take faith rather and apply the blood of jesus christ by faith to the heart store this was going to separate and make the difference between those who were born out of egypt and those who were going to stay in egypt and perish with with egypt hmm same message now let's go to uh joshua chapter 2. somebody else applied a token to joshua joshua we're going to read the whole chapter chapter 2 joshua 2 verse 1 and we're going to read the whole thing and joshua the son of nonsense two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into a heartless house named rehab and lodged there and he was told the king on jericho saying behold there came man and hitler tonight tonight are the children of israel to search out the land and that king and jericho said until rehab saying bring forth the man that will come to thee which are entered into the house for they come to search out all the all the country and the woman took the two men and hit them and said thus there came man unto me but i wish not once they were and it came to pass about that time i shut another gate when it was dark that the man went out whether the man when i will not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them but she brought them up to the roof of the house and hit them with the stalks of flats which she had laid in order order upon the roof and a man pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fortress as soon as they which pursued after them were going on they shut the gate and before they were laid down they came up onto them upon the roof and she said unto them they met i know that the lord had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the man may be caused of you we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan see on and off whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord of god he is god in heaven above and earth below beneath so she is a believer now therefore i pray you sir unto me but the lord says i have shown you kindness that you will also show kindness onto my father's house and give me a true token and then you will save a lot it will save a life my father my mother and my brother my sister and all that they had and deliver our lives from dead and the man answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and they shall be when the lord had given us that land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she lit and she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwell upon that wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain list the pursuit meet you and hide yourself there three days until that pursuers be returned and afterward may you go your way and the man said unto her we will be blameless of that this thing oath which thou has made us swear behold when they come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet threat and the window which this led us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and my mother and my brother and all that father home and to thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the door of the house and to the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whose server shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any and be upon him without part of this or business then we will be quick quick assign both which that has made us to swear and she said according unto your words over here and she send them away and they parted and she bombed a started line in the window and they went and came out to the mountain and i bowed there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but from them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of another told him all the things that dwell bewell then and they said unto joshua truly the lord had delivered unto our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country thanked the god because of us by the way said even the whole town if they wanted to they could have come under her token and they would have been saved but they said they didn't you know the bottom of the scorpio said the the line now the scarlet liner rehab speaks by its color as safety through sacrifice so what this really means is redemption through the blood wow november 28 1963 stripper shreveport louisiana he said uh look at joshua and you read joshua the second chapter a guy who wrote down here really i haven't got the time but i want you to know when moses and joshua were on the road through the wilderness coming to the exodus they sent out some minister spies to go supply of the land and remember there was a gentile over on the other side of the river by the name i read she was a harlot poor kid must have been a street worker perhaps turned out by her parents but her family but we find out that when she's seeing those men and knew that they were man of god she she was a harlot and she wanted to know there could be any mercy god could be granted to her god gives mercy to those who call for mercy and all that call for mercy shall receive mercy amen she said i'll show kindness she didn't have to see joshua she didn't know the way he calmed his hair the clothes he was she said i have heard and god is with you that's all she wanted to know they saying this and they know she know it was the truth she asked for mercy what for both her and her family she asked for her and her family just like they did in egypt and notice it was given to her a token a red token that the scarlet strain that she let the people the spies down out of the window was to be a token god would not this destroy angel god the strong angel would not come near her as long as she had that token but and what if she said oh i'll let them down a good deed so now to keep anybody from criticizing me and seeing the scarlet rope hanging out there i'll just pull the rope back up then the judgment angel would have never passed over her house she had to have the token display it had to be had to remain there he said i believe that the scarlet threat had to be displayed or the angel destroying angel would have never honored anything else but that token when it was displayed the messengers gave her a token and she must keep it displayed said notice jericho had heard what god had done but did nothing to take the warning see they could have gone in but they didn't but one little harlot there must have been some tape boys i guess they don't have cds or whatever people slip in there and play some other tape that pretty destinated sheet caught it and believe it so anyhow they got in there for a message at church that night in her house to use the hospital church to receive the message he said oh god let us open our hearts and receive the message that jesus is alive tonight is right here among us he is the same yesterday to hear forever open your house and let the messenger the holy ghost come in and identify you by his own person the token is upon you then you don't have to take anybody else's word for it he is there to speak for himself and he's a word that's right it's got toka to identify his own own self she used her house for the messengers then she got all the city that we believe under the same token was probably not unbelievable and that's the way the church should be doing today getting everything that will believe under that token the token is the holy ghost just remember they must get under the holy ghost brother brandon said that did you know that blood speaks uh let's turn to genesis chapter four first nobody thank you wait a minute genesis chapter 4 verse 10 and he said what has thou done the boys that have brothers blood cried unto me from the ground and the token message began november 20 1963 he said paul tells us talking about speaking of the blood paul tells us that the blood speaks you believe that the blood speaks in genesis 4 1 or 4 10 god told ken he said where is your brother he said his blood has his voice the blood of his voice but his blood calls out against you he said uh he said now we also find in hebrews 12 chapter 24 after offensive we go to hebrews 12 chapter chapter 12 and 24. first that the new testament the blood speaks better than things the blood is speaking and the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is a word that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and it quickens it amen true the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the old testament the blood spoke of guilt in the new testament speaks of the redemption in the old testament it speaks of death and sorrow in the new testament speaks our resurrection in life it speaks of healing it speaks of joy speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed upon the ground and called up after his dead brother or call out after his brother had killed him the blood of jesus christ covers all our sins and speaks peace and restoration and the power of life and the healing and all that redemption blessing that the blood was shed for it for hebrews 12. me 24 give us 12 24 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant to the blood of the sprinkling and speaking better thing than the able in the toku november 20 1963 brethren said today every church every individual cannot display the token of the holy ghost it's spiritually dying and will die say the order of the passover it must be a male sheep and he must be tested for 14 days what a perfect type of christ and to type a male a lamb he was tested for three and a half years of his ministry through critics but true proof to hold it fast to the father's word even the presence of satan he said it is written you guys are looking at my child any questions any comments um
