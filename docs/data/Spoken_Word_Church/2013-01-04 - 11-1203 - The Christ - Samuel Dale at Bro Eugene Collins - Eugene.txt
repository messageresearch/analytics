we need need his help too he came up and spoke for us that's right and we really had a wonderful time that's right matter of fact I didn't think he had it in him just honest you know I've known him a long time that he just opened his heart that night and spoke to us and really blessed us that's right and I hope that the way it would be tonight in the morning to to help and to try to you know just Endeavor but I have I I feel the presence of God here more than I have in a lot of the big places I've been and feel no behind to where that you know that's right say well you know I'm afraid to say this or afraid to say that I don't have no problems tonight that's right so if I open up my heart talk to you okay um we're going to have a watch Night Service on the 31st and there's a brother Tommy

we take communion as close as we can to the midnight hour so come be with us and just have a good time Colossians 1 before we read his word the prophet of God one day said it like this and always stuck with me he said no man has a right to open a Bible or to read until he asked permission the author of the book amen so let's ask his permission father we truly thank you tonight for your love and your grace unto us thank you for an opportunity to come down and fellowship with our brothers and sisters we ask you to just bless and have your way with what we would say tonight and forgive our sins lead us Lord in thy love and just let your light shine to each one of our hearts that we may see you teach us to wait Lord upon you and in Waiting then we will come to that place to work that you want us to be guide each one blessing little place Lord amen May there be a light shining protect it guide it Lord let it be in your love in Jesus name amen amen Colossians 1 be very familiar with all of uses that as we read God's word and just speak a little while Colossians 1:15 now we're going to speak on we're going to talk about the Christ of God the Christ of God you see the scripture read it oh but we want to lay down the foundation and then we'll be seated and we got a lot of scripture to read but I love to read his word that's just my way of doing it I love to read his word and and let you see what he said and that way he said that wasn't what brother Dale thought that's what the Bible say right verse 15 said who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist right and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the pre preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now we know who he talking about the Lord Jesus Christ right let's just drop down to verse vers uh 26 to say the reading between even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and for Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory you may be seated now I said I want to just take a little thought and just talk about we say we believe in one true and living God yes and we're not Trinity but we don't go that route that's right and and we're not oness because we don't go into that route that's right so the truth is uh somewhere in between the two that went one one way and one the other and the truth lies between well the truth is that there is there just one true and living God and the Lord Jesus Christ is that God now when I get down in a little while and start talking and when I talk about the Christ when I talk about the Christ or if I say Jesus Christ now I'm I'm telling you up front so you know let your mind be to where you'll remember this that don't uh think that I'm talking about the flesh that flesh had a begin about 2,000 years ago to fulfill the scriptures Hebrews 10:5 a body thou H has prepared for me all right the prophet of God said in body he was a man that's right but said in Soul he was God all right well that's the one we're talking about the one true and living God yes sir okay then that way then he was born Emmanuel God With Us that's right uhhuh he he was born Lord the Christ so then we we we lay it down and just think about it that who he is and and where he is and that's what we want to do so if you'd like to I I like to go in the scriptures and look at something so let's go to Matthew and we're talking about this one that we call the Lord Jesus Christ as I said now if I say Jesus Christ or Christ I'm not meaning the flesh amen everybody everybody got my point and I'm not meaning the flesh if I mean flesh I'll tell you about the flesh but I'm meaning the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir brother almighty God Amen cuz I asked my church a question years ago and and I hold on here I asked my church years ago a question and I said when you think of the Son of God I said when is what do you think of and they said well 2,000 years ago you know and I said well that's fine but I said according to the Bible and according to the prophet's message right that the son of lot the Son of God was the Loos that come out of God in the beginning absolutely that's why he's called the Christ yes that was the way of doing it you know because that way you you you keep it to the Christ yes and then you can follow that that's what we want to follow through the Bible but I want to First establish who it was was that was there that we read about oh yes and let the gospels declare him to be who he Isel look at Matthew very familiar with all us Matthew 16 the Lord and we'll read this from Matthew Mark Luke and John we're going to read the same thing and I want what I want you to watch is that each one of them describes him uh and they all totally compare to say the same thing that's right but each one will maybe one will say a little bit more than the other that's right and that's why I like it because see if Matthew said it Mark said it exactly the same all the writings Luke said all of it just all the writings John would say all of it U it would there would be no need of having Matthew Mark luk and John that's right you you would just have one yes but if you'll notice then you got as the prophet of God taught us that you got your Lon the ox of man and the eagle the combat Beach yes sir all right so he says line Matthew see Mark o y man Luke uhuh and Eagle John that's right and if you'll read in your scriptures you'll see that each one of them is explaining the same person but yet they're using their own human ability sometime and wording to express that from and I love that yes all right so then you'll find that in like in in Mark you'll find the Mark 16 you know about laying hands on the sick you find a lot of healing things all right Luke you'll find he's more or less like he's he's using the shrewdness of a man to break down who this is that's right and Luke is the only one and remember Luke was not an original disciple no that's right right he comes on with Paul all right he's not one of the original all right so you do it but look at look he says having perfect understanding and he was the only one that said it that way that's right but then you get to John John is more prophetic right bringing in to show you the prophetic side of almighty God keep that in mind now as we go along look at man Matthew 16 very familiar with us verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi guessed his disciples saying who do men say that I the son of man and they said and they said some say that thou John the Baptist some El another J M are one of the Apostles one of the prophets excuse me and he said to them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right now Jesus went on to tell him said now my father is the one that had to reveal that to you yes brother R in reference to that he even said it this way he said Jesus was saying my own life right did not reveal that unto you that's right see it took the holy spirit cuz he's the only revealer of the world right all right now go over to mark okay and when they compare totally we just read to verse 29 all right because basically what the others are saying and he say unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answered and said unto him Thou Art the Christ all right now so what do we got over here now Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God whereas Mark he just more or less shortens it to the bases that D the Christ yes okay now pick up Luke which is Luke 9 we'll read this 18 and 19 and 20 and it came to pass as he was a long praying see that's a little different from the saying of the other so it's not something that you say well well one of them is contrary to the other one no it's four different men writing of the situation of life around them at the time but each one of them is led by the Holy Spirit to to publicly pronounce or deire who this one is absolutely now as far as their their small amount of their words and May different in the wording right yes sir but their pronunciation or their statement they make of him is all the same oh yes but came to pass that he was aone praying his disciples were with him and he asked him say whom say the people that I am yep and they answer and said John the Baptist but some say El and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again see that's not listed in some of the other but it's still the same right and he said to them but whom say ye that I am y Peter answering said the Christ of God oh my listen yes Hallelujah but is there any difference in saying the Christ or the Christ the son of the Living God or the Christ of God right right amen is there any difference in the no it's just different ways of expressing it if you'll notice in the in the writings you'll find that uh one of the gospels gives uh one blind man one of the other gospels gives two Blind Men so people say look like contradiction no one of them saw one he didn't see the other one the other one saw two and you got to remember that if it's Luke that's writing who claims to have perfect understanding by the Holy Spirit remember Luke is having to take what somebody says yes right that's right so then there one seeing one and one seeing two that make contradictions see people do that to try to make make it a lie and fail to get that each one of them is describing who Jesus Christ is to them that's right and from the Revelation they're receiving so Luke here says he's the Christ of God yes all right let's go over to John now and then we'll get into more our thought John 6 verse 67 then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away now that's not listed in Matthew Mark Luke but that doesn't make it a contradiction that makes each one of them see in a different situation and then describing it and sometimes now if you know the history of the writing of the Bible basically uh in other words they wasn't going along as Jesus said something and they pin it down P it down no that's right that wasn't what they done no it's a long about ad50 oh my which was almost 20 years after the death of Christ right that that they started really writing down the records and things and you know it it wasn't that they were just going along writing it down look he done this he they were doing the most of it by memory but remember the memory could not be different absolutely from the god of the world absolutely so then God truly was the if they were writing it down you could see it as one thing maybe but I'd rather have it the way it come out because that way it came out by the Holy Spirit leading Matthew to write Mark to write Luke to write after hearing from and John really Mark was not an original right oh we only have Matthew and and John but Mark and Luke were not original disciples right so they were getting there from other things but the holy spirit is perfect in the way it say amen all right cuz they were describing who they saw right all right now John what did you see then said Jesus unto the 12 will you go will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go that's right watch what he says Thou Hast the words of eternal life we got a description in ain't that prophetic yes we we're talking about the Eagles see right the anointing Ministry and we believe and our sure that thou art that Christ oh L amen yes sir notice that in your scripture now thank you Father thou art that Christ right the son of the Living God yes now you think about it when it says th that Christ Y in other words he's prophetic in stating that there's no way to be anything else other than what you are Abol absolutely oh you're that Christ yes now who was that Christ oh right oh that's the point yes he emphasized the word that uhhuh so then what he's saying is is the same thing Matthew was saying same Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God all right here then John picking up Peter's answer and Peter is saying thou art that Christ yes oh the one that was to come yes and that Christ right all right now we're not talking about anointed ones of that word Christ yes okay cuz the word anointing means Christ and back and forth that's right but there's only one God right and there's only one Christ am yes amen and that would have to be Jesus Christ so what was Peter saying what was the Revelation that he got oh yes yes if you remember and read on down in Matthew you'll hear this flesh and blood is not revealed that unto thee but my Father which is in heaven but if you go back and read above that you'll see Jesus is asking who do Man say I the son of man am yes sir Peter never got the Revelation oh this right right of what God was asking right that's right but he got what was for the time because he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against this revelation of God see the son of man according to Luke 17 oh my yes would be coming in the end time mhm he knew he was the son of man yes he did oh but he had to build a church upon the rock yes which is Christ to reveal word that's right now so then that would be that if we believe the Bible that if we believe that Hebrews 13:8 is correct then he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right see that's why you can't have all of these doctrines and ideas of God here in the end time that are running so wrong because it won't fit Hebrews 13:8 right because if he ever was God he would have to be God and he have to always be God if he was ever the Christ he have to be Christ he has to always be the Christ absolutely that's right you see my point th AR the Christ yes so we got a great Revelation in he oh praise God yes he got the Revelation that's right Peter was actually saying you are that Christ am that Christ that always existed you are the Creator right are you listening right Peter was actually declaring that God had revealed to him that inside of that human body was standing the very almighty God right that created the world you can't have another Creator no you can't all right and we read there in Colossians and all things were created by Him by who by Jesus Christ it said abely I say it where you won't get mixed up not Jesus the flesh but the flesh wouldn't bti Sirus Christ that's why we don't believe in Eternal sunship that's right that's right right that's right you don't believe that no sir you can't have the sunship existing in the form of Flesh that's right right but he was the Creator God yes right John 1 1-3 says that all things were made by him you know in the beginning was work work God work was God work we going through but we failed to watch most of the time when he say and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made that's right brother who was the maker Jesus Christ he the son of the Living God true the one the prophet in the the questions and answers of Genesis said it was like a little Halo of light went out oh yes he said it's like the father there and said like a son playing before the door yeah this little Halo of Life called a little go theop all those big words that we talk about but break it down into simple terminology we don't believe in many gods but we believe that God can change his form right that's according to scripture in Colossians that's right he can change his form yes he can to where he can appear in different forms all right so then what do he just changed his form and stepped over into the word and begin to create the same God yes he did not another God oh sir this was not the prophet said God creating Jesus and Jesus creating everything else he said that make him less than godhead absolutely y so that can't be so he was the Creator God or are we're all Mally confused that's right listen amen so John declares it and says all things were made by him yes oh my Hebrews 1 1 and 2 thank you Father God speaking in Su town and diverse manners in the prophets by the prophets in is the correct right sir in the prophets right then he comes down to the lights says these light spoken to us by his son by whom also he made the world yep read that Hebrews 13 there yes or 1 2 right right now let's turn over to Ephesians because we done cover Colossians that all things were created by Him oh praise God let's turn to Ephesians and just read what it says about this one Ephesians 3 who is the creator right verse n and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hided God who created All Things by Jesus Christ right oh my listen all right now so then Jesus Christ had to be almighty God and not Jesus the flesh you don't get your M Jesus the Christ that's why did you go over in the book of Acts and you'll find in the the message that um was bringing there I believe it was by it was Peter once bringing it and you'll find out that he was the one that spoke to Moses from the burning bshs who the Christ amen who was the angel of the Covenant amen Paul declares it was Christ yes absolutely yes Christ was the angel of the C who was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel that's right the Bible declares it was the Christ yes oh yes the Christ of God yes that Christ yes oh the one who was back gued said let there be yes God in another form yes the prophet of God said when it come time for man and we had sinned upon the Earth he said God couldn't send a son he said you wouldn't do that would you send one of your children to die or would you come yourself that's right amen he said he would not do that he said he came himself he said he just changed his form oh yes amen and he just stepped over that's why the people can't understand it see that's why the Trinity is wrong because You' have free running the r and then they'd be arguing over who done the Crea and what went on that's right oh and you leave the father out of the creation because the son would be the Creator but if the son was God himself the father made manifest in another form yes listen then it's the same true and living godr yes sir brother see then when he stood here on the shores of Galilee he was Christ the same yesterday today forever yes he was amen that's why he can stand there and say before Abraham was I am oh yes thank God yes y amen he said in other words I spoke to Abraham yes Abraham met the Christ yes he called him eles yes amen oh my see many thank you Father Moses saw the chist he oh my remember the story Lord let me see you yes oh that's always amazed me that amazed me when I was in the Baptist that a man who stand up there and the Bible said he talk to God lip to lip in other words face to face he and then he turns right around in another next few verses he said Lord I'd like to see you yes he said anyway I see you they been in his presence he been on the M he been he said Lord I like he said go stand in the Cliff of The Rock how did that rock get the cliff that was the one he smoke over there when the water come running out of yes it cuz that was Christ yes see where Moses got in problems when he struck it the second time that wasn't Christ telling him to do that that's right Christ told him to strike it the first time who wasn't in all those prophets that were speaking to mankind amen oh who was it when when brother R gets over in Exodus 32 about 32 right 30 32 when he gets into that situation where there that Moses you know the children of Israel have sinned against God and made the golden caves and the thing and Moses come up to the place and he says I'll go up I'll go up said pre-venture how can make some kind of atonement and we w't get on that tonight oh you might get that tomorrow cuz all I want to ask you is what did he offer oh my that's right yes that's all I want to ask you yes Lord what did Moses you got from tonight till in the morning to find Moses what Moses offered check it out that's right come and tell me what he offered yes said pre- Adventure I make an atonement remember that was the story when he said Lord if you blot out their name they BL block my name out also that's right brother ROM said and I got these L here if you want he said that bothered me how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something oh L he said I seen that it was Christ and Moses yes absolutely yes that wasn't Moses that stood up there and said take my life that was Christ inside of the man but the man was human but he submitted himself he was willing to die for his people yes he was it's like Abraham feeding m C yes the Bible Hebrews 4 Hebrews 7:4 called in the man M amen he ate the C and talk to Abraham and said can I withhold anything from Abraham seeing he's the heir of all things J the Christ who was it back there that was speaking them yeah the Christ who was it in Moes that could tell God a better way of doing something it was Christ God listened to him right he said go on he said I'll deal with them when I need to deal with them but said it's your word I'll still pardon cuz that's numbers I'm love father listen that Christ was the leading the children of Israel right who was it in David when the said he would be singing in the spirit it says he was singing one day and he said the Lord said unto my Lord oh yes thank sit down on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stool who was that in those prophets brother R said when Moses was speaking to the children of Israel they had to put the veil remember over his face and he came off when he was speak he said he was God to the people he said when he stepped back he become Moses about because he was a man right yes but in the presence of the for the people they had to really call him God right because that's what he was absolutely he said you're God and said Aron's your Prophet yes did you say you can't talk get him to talk for you absolutely but you see what I'm talking about right that Christ that could come all the way down to look at it in all those like I said David as he would sing those psalms those hyns yes oh he get in the spirit and he say in the spirit oh yes one day he was singing away and he said blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin was it because David was such a good guy now he was a murderer adultery he was all kind of things deserve to die yes amen but the prophet that he said it to him Nathan remember turned back to David and said and David said bring the man up here that's done that and let me kill him oh Nathan said David you're the man oh God that's right watch it if it hadn't been a prophet they' have killed Nathan yes I mean killed David right there yes that me for the prophet Nathan the Nathan said but God told me he not going to kill you he ain't going to let you build house Jesus study your Bible and see that Christ follow him down to there as he leads the children of Israel and that Pillar of Fire would move oh yes and the cloud by day would move the children of Israel would move in it amen thank at the words of a man God would listen and excuse me for saying it cuz I don't have any education if God had changed his mind he said now wait minut okay well that's good we know God don't change his mind that's right he knew what he was going to do but he was fixing to kill them people that's right he was right he was fixing to kill him now don't you think he knew who was going to step in the way before he got there sure amen he was coming down in the garden yes he was coming down in the garden he was going to kill that Adam and Eve sin can't stand in the presence of God you got to have an atonement amen oh God see before he could come in there and destroy then he himself had to kill those animals yes it did you said God did my Bible says it yes it did that's right prophet of God says it l yes it is that God killed those animals yes Oh my he said Adam and Eve was back in the bush he having church it's the words he use really thought they were doing good my said God right made right amen amen why before the foundation of the world he said all names were written in the lamb book alive he stood the lamb slain so he couldn't kill out need what took care of Adam and Eve the minutes or seconds they were standing there if it was ever a day or how long it was that they were standing there before God after they both sin but took care of them that's right God promised it right amen God promised it then he turned around he's running them out of the garden right you're prophet of God says it like this he said there he was he said God could not let them leave like that even though he had done major skins to cover them and done off he said he couldn't let them leave like that said as they started out of the garden said he turned and said Adam the seed of the woman will come yep to take care of everything that's right it took 4,000 years right for that Christ to be able to be born upon the Earth see then when they looked at Jesus they could see that Christ yes that was what was revealed to him you are you are that one that has created you are that God MH yes right you are that Christ yes oh the one that was promised to come yeah to take away our sin yeah but Christ amen the son of the Living God if you notice in I believe what is it in Hebrews where it said half in these last days spoken unto us in his son son that's all right you know God's still speaking am yes sir yes sir I believe God still speak he said no brother brand was here and he only one spoke well then he's not Hebrews 13:8 right so you goofed up somewhere right cuz you got him talking you got him talking you got him quitting come on no sir he's still in his bride that's right when we read Colossians to start with that it's what what happened on that day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down from heaven as a mighty rushing wind oh listen yes and sett in the church yes y Paul said is Christ in you abely the am thank you Father praise the prophet of God said it like this he said to the same God that created the world Amen is now living in you in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you a new birth oh yes Hall see that makes in Hebrews 13 that's not another God another situation that's where you w this Miss see your Trinity we know they were wrong CU it can't be true right but the oness see they hold that Oneness Oneness Oneness but go find you want and ask him he'll tell you brother R will tell you that oness is one like your finger abely go find you one brother s he went found any one yes he found somebody that could express you know what a one this Doctrine is when that Jesus was the life form of God right that's a one this doct that's correct Jesus they believe was the life form of God y now I don't believe that amen I believe the bride is the life form of God because it's Christ in you the hope of glory not another God not another thought and idea right amen is Christ Living in you right yes it is oh my speaking brother said God wants to use you Amen to speak that's right to the people y you go out and you testify to somebody what do you think it's doing if it's really right now if you're just trying your best to convince them that's not Christ that's right that's you and a little bit of God I say it that way because you do have some truth yes yeah you want to go out and do it yeah but when you really l oh my now listen heard of a man in the church one time and won call where it was because they might not want it because it was told at our church but this man was R driving down the road one day he looked over and he seen this woman walking down the highway and he knew what she was she was a prostitute he pulled over to the side and roll down the window and he said how much for your time she said so much he said crawl in she got in the car and he handed her the money he went parked stopped the car said I have your time yes yes he said I want to talk to you about your soul am he said God spoke to me told me to talk to you prise God you know she scared of death then she'd never heard nothing like that right in her business she's in she' never heard nobody talk like that right but you know in a little bit she became under conviction and came to church got amen that's right I'm just wondering do we really know the voice of God y right well see Satan can tell us sure especially now after we hear the story yes see Satan can tell you walk you know would stop you remember R random saw this young girl walking down the road about 16 years old didn't have many clothes on twist anyway he said I'll go back and talk to her the holy spirit said you do and you'll be arrested y so you got to know it's God it's got to be Christ yes if it's Christ it'll be right yes oh God wor about it that's right but is God still talking amen sir I believe he's talking to his bride she's the last form now the the 144,000 will be the form of God after we leave right so it's all not over with that's why they told me when I first came into the mission they told me it said Redemption was over 60 3 and I said well I'm sorry I don't claim the Holy Ghost but I didn't claim it just because I come into the mission I seen I didn't have it because of the Prophet the way he was expressing it and I mean I was a deacon at 23 years of age I was teaching adult Sunday School classes when I left which was the deacons and elders and they their F you know them the older people but I saw that I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost well don't you think it's something when I come into the message and the first thing they told me said you can't be saved got 63 I said well according to the prophet and the way he says things is one thing but I said you know according to my Bible is what a call see I had a good decent memory of the Bible I had more of it then than I have now cuz I've lost a lot of it but I said according to my Bible Redemption was over before the world ever begun amen that's right yes sir but all names were written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of that's right I said you're telling me that I that redemption's over you see that was the point I was getting I said even after we leave out of here people when I told him I said there is a Redemption going to Israel the 144,000 will be the form of God for the period in time and even that the white Throne judgment the foolish virgins and those people will be given eternal life do you agree amen then Redemption is not over until all die that's right brother amen let nobody don't run around say one said Don't listen to man s listen to God that's right you see I was 2 years before I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes reading six books a day and listening to two takes oh yes I had a wonderful job and a great opportunity not just packing everything I could get brother Dale you you say you didn't have a that no I didn't I knew I didn't I knew I was justified and Sanctified because I heard what the prophet had to say and I knew that that person that he was speaking of was not in my heart oh listen yes church because I saw that person when I was 11 years old standing in a church Lord that I wanted that God in my heart see God is still talking yes he is he's still speaking through his bride where he really wanted to be oh god oh when we say when that which is perfect is come that's which is part has done away we know that's not doing away with the gospel right that's right amen it's coming to Perfection but you know what I believe that which is perfect I'm looking at it I've been preaching eight or nine sermons already on perfect oh God yes Hallelujah on the word perfect I'm looking at perfect amen this is the Perfection that's coming to change our bodies this is where we can actually stand in the in the last days and the ch abolutely these bodies can be changed Martin Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't do it they could not do that it takes the word to bring that which is PR John in what we read in there said thou H has the words of eternal life that's right he knew he didn't have eternal life but he knew he was standing before one that even is worth was eternal life what about you and I amen that's right Paul said Christ in you the hope oh what is he said that's right hallu you doubt I mean just a hope when you receive the new birth you reach the condition in existence that you realize right I have eternal life in my soul that's right but I wonder about this body cuz that's what we used to do we used to all teach and get us a new body they still doing that in the M but still teaching get a new body that's thir is the same mind I ain't got time to F with you see according to my Bible my Prophet Jesus even raised R nail Prince and his body so it must be the same one amen that's what the prophet said and what the Bible said sir amen but you see they don't believe that God is great enough to redeem this oh my why why if he can put it in the soul why can't he bring it out into the body right if he can heal this body yep why can he not give it eternal life that's we got to go to the one that's got eternal life absolutely absolutely we got to go to the source of eternal life amen that's what John declared thou Hast the words of eternal life you are the Christ you are allight God hallelujah and Jesus is that brings a hope when you receive the new birth yes that's right come on that's what Paul's talking about absolutely when you receive the new birth in this age now the ages down through there they could only have a hope of redemption that's right are you listening yes Luther and them they couldn't teach to change of the body because they didn't know right now they can read the Bible yes but it not been revealed unto him so they were dealing with a hope yes but that hope make us not ashame that word hope doesn't mean hope yeah look it up it doesn't mean that it's the same word as Faith yes oh my it's just the way you're saying it yes because the new birth brings you in this day a hope yes it did an understanding that these bodies can be changed how by the Christ that's inside of us amen amen Oh Glory yes so then he was that Christ yes he was and he's still that Christ he who is it to you brother there he's that Christ amen that's right he's that Christ that spoke the world he's that Christ that guided the children of Israel he's that Christ that can tell God a better way of doing so and God listen to him amen oh he's that Christ and who are you Christ in you then who are you uhhuh come on come on folks I think spending a lot of time think about it who are you come on right you are that Christ amen hallelujah what Christ the Christ is going to take a change in the body amen yes absolutely the Christ is going to bring us to a change Resurrection ra the Dead I told my church probably 30 years ago or more I said the way I see it there's going to be a lot of people have to die before the change you know the moment the twinkle an eye the change comes I snap my finger where you mean see what I mean the moment the twinkle of an eye a say they're not in going to be in the Rapture no way but I said there'll be a lot of people go by the grave because they won't be able to stand to take that chain because they won't see who that Christ is Buried one just the other day and we sprinkled his IES I told my wife 20 years ago or old I said Don come back he back and went I had problems but I said he'll come back that's right before the end he came back amen I think God still speaking amen you think that was your idea when I stood and told him my son back there would be come to the Lord all the years and he back to Liv and I kept telling everybody else he's com that's right Joy Fon she can wi me said you know Danny I come to her one day and she was talking about it I said Danny Choice has coming forget it oh I mean Danny's coming I told Joy I said Danny's coming right I said forget it and you know what he fell off a chicken house might got killed you know what he's the church today oh my yes that's right you see I kept telling him my son's coming cuz God showed me you know what he showed me the Bible says you'll be there with your Offspring yep right that's what the Bible says Y and every time I see that I mind I said that's me that's me he's talking to me then he came back to the Lord I went to my wife from d and said there's more to the story now she said what I said you going to be standing in pooping preaching with me well he's preaching in the morning out down here see I believe God's too that's right amen yes sir you know you don't think about it a lot of times but you're doing a lot of speaking yourself that's right true you know like yes why don't she just speak I don't have any problems with telling somebody the Lord told me something and then it don't come to B Butz I would say the Lord didn't tell me that that's what the Bible said I said it presly but if I said it in it comes to P then it wouldn't me anyway that's right it was the Christ absolutely the same one that said let there be light yes amen AB that's right brother amen say your son will be in the ministry beside of you oh thank God the same God yes that's right why can't we believe that but you see we doubt it right something comes to you your thought comes to you and you doubt it why when not speaking amen oh yes but I've never been one like this now I'm not one that I'm straight on what I'm saying I I don't believe in speaking something that takes 100 years for it to come to p and another generation does yeah I don't believe in that right God tells you it's going to come to P come amen that's right and it'll come pass your lifetime and you're do it Y and it ain't well I think somebody in here might have a wreck one of these days well about 20 something 20 Oaks or something you know average percentage if we go for 20 years one of us going to have right right right but see that's not God speak no that's right that's not that's right that's why they done that with brother R see and he said one of these days I'll show you that wasn't right said it only exposed them Absolut he would stand up there into discernment and things he said that would have been used to start with he said but it exposed the other why cuz God don't have to have none of that that's right he says it that's it I believe he's still talking amen I believe he Hebrews 138 that's right amen and if he was back there he's still here right amen when are we going to believe that's right when are we going to accept it right you got a love one that's lost speak the word come that's right that's right what if it don't happen they're lost what what did you add to the problem yeah right they're lost what did you add to the problem
