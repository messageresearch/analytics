[6:40] amen Revelations
[6:45] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[6:48] God gave unto him to sh unto his
[6:50] servants things which must shortly come
[6:52] to pass and he said and signified it by
[6:55] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[6:57] record of the word of God and the test
[6:59] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[7:01] things that he saw blessed is he that
[7:03] readeth and they that hear the words of
[7:05] this
[7:06] prophecy and keep those things which are
[7:09] written therein for the time is at hand
[7:13] what for time to understand all right
[7:15] Revelations 14:
[7:19] 6 and I saw another Angel flying in the
[7:23] midst of Heaven having the Everlasting
[7:26] gospel to preach unto them that dwell on
[7:28] the Earth and to every nation and
[7:30] Kindred and tongue and people singing
[7:33] with a loud voice fear God and give
[7:36] glory to him for the hour of his
[7:39] judgment is come and and worship him
[7:41] that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[7:44] and The Fountains of water and there
[7:47] followed another Angel saying Babylon is
[7:49] Fallen is Fallen that great City because
[7:52] she made all nations drink of the wine
[7:54] of the wrath of her
[7:56] fornication and the third Angel followed
[7:58] them saying saying with a loud voice if
[8:01] any man worship the beast in His image
[8:03] and receive his Mark in his forehead or
[8:06] in his hand the same shall drink of the
[8:09] wine or the wrath of God which is poured
[8:12] out without me mixture into the cup of
[8:15] his indignation and he shall be
[8:18] tormented with fire and brimstone in the
[8:20] presence of the Holy Angels and the
[8:22] presence of the Lamb you may be seated
[8:25] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[8:28] of the word
[8:30] now I made some extra
[8:32] copies of the quotes that we'll be
[8:34] giving out tonight so if anybody uh
[8:37] needs a uh a copy raise your hand and
[8:42] we'll let brother Donnie or some of them
[8:44] pass them out to you of the quotes for
[8:47] tonight they'll be using so if there's
[8:49] any anybody needing a copy of them let's
[8:52] take it and uh you know we don't have
[8:55] them for everybody we just need them if
[8:56] you want them all right some people like
[8:59] to read some read it off the screen and
[9:02] other things all right but
[9:05] now we've read this and we've been
[9:08] talking in This Book of
[9:10] Revelations and been on it now for quite
[9:13] a while trying to just go through the
[9:16] book and see and we got here now to
[9:18] verse six says and there was another
[9:21] angel in the midst of Heaven what having
[9:25] the Everlasting gospel to preach unto to
[9:29] them that dwell on the
[9:31] earth so now remember that you're in
[9:34] heaven with your viewings and things
[9:37] that are taking place but yet on Earth
[9:40] is where the Everlasting gospel is
[9:44] brought forth all right and what is the
[9:47] Everlasting
[9:49] gospel now what would be something that
[9:51] would be in the
[9:54] Bible as I was trying to bring out
[9:56] Sunday what would it be that could be
[10:00] counted as the Everlasting gospel now
[10:03] the word Everlasting can be counted as
[10:06] Eternal it's According to which way it's
[10:09] being used it can be used as talking of
[10:13] God and his ways and everlasting can be
[10:15] the word Eternal so we're talking about
[10:19] then the Eternal gospel or the
[10:21] Everlasting gospel what is the
[10:23] Everlasting gospel what would it be that
[10:26] you could look into the Bible and you
[10:28] could find a Doctrine or a thought
[10:31] because the Bible is a Doctrine you know
[10:34] you say we don't have no Doctrine when
[10:35] you just lied right because everybody's
[10:38] got a Doctrine if you don't have a
[10:40] Doctrine you don't have a church or a
[10:41] thought all right but now what would be
[10:45] then that would tie together in the
[10:48] understanding to each and every one of
[10:51] us that we would see the uh you know and
[10:55] understand it's the Everlasting
[10:57] gospel all right we know for assurity
[11:00] that the first message Jesus preached
[11:02] was
[11:03] what he told Nicodemus he said you must
[11:06] be born again right that was his first
[11:09] Doctrine if you want to call it because
[11:12] the Bible I said is a Doctrine all right
[11:15] and see Nicodemus couldn't understand
[11:18] right because he said now how can I
[11:19] enter my mother's wound and come forth
[11:23] another time in other words would that
[11:24] do me any
[11:25] good if you're saying that I'm messed up
[11:28] this way
[11:30] and I need a uh to be born again and if
[11:34] you'll check your your
[11:37] uh D lots and things there you'll see
[11:40] that it's saying You must be born from
[11:42] above and that's what Nicodemus couldn't
[11:45] catch he couldn't get together the fact
[11:47] of he he could only talk about going
[11:49] back to his mother and coming out again
[11:52] and you he knew that was impossible and
[11:55] he knew that that would not do any good
[11:58] you know to to be able to do that cuz
[12:00] you would just have you know the person
[12:02] there the second time but see it means
[12:04] that you must be born from above amen
[12:07] amen in other words Jesus was saying
[12:10] what you need to do
[12:12] Nicodemus is to be born
[12:16] again in the Kingdom that I'm trying to
[12:19] bring amen right all right and that
[12:22] Kingdom would be the baptism of the Holy
[12:24] Ghost it would come on the day of
[12:26] Pentecost right all right then it says
[12:29] You must be born again oh yeah you need
[12:32] to be born from where I came
[12:36] from cuz what good as I said would it do
[12:38] for us to be born the second time or
[12:40] third time or 10th time upon the Earth
[12:44] but yet when you we could if we could
[12:45] just be born from where he come
[12:48] from all right now the only way that we
[12:50] could ever do that was that God
[12:55] himself would have to come down right
[12:58] and make a way that we could be born
[13:02] again amen all right see it couldn't be
[13:05] just something that we have a thought or
[13:06] a doctorine or idea that is not the new
[13:09] birth cuz that's not your natural birth
[13:12] I you think about it I want to get
[13:13] natural spiritual natural spiritual for
[13:15] enough tonight for us to see something
[13:18] because if your natural birth is
[13:20] Nicodemus say that won't do me any good
[13:22] to do
[13:23] that all right that was exactly right
[13:26] cuz your natural birth it wouldn't make
[13:28] no difference with Brother Ray there
[13:30] born 6 72 years ago right about it was
[13:34] close anyway that's it well what good
[13:37] would it do for him to be born again you
[13:39] know of a natural
[13:40] birth that wouldn't
[13:42] happen but if in some
[13:45] way God could make a way and he
[13:48] did for us to be able to be born into
[13:52] the kingdom that he was speaking
[13:55] of see then that way we could understand
[13:59] but see Nicodemus couldn't catch that
[14:02] amen and he Jesus went on to try to
[14:05] explain and he said if you can't
[14:07] understand these things I'm telling you
[14:09] how can you understand the things of
[14:12] heaven
[14:13] right see Jesus was
[14:17] explaining that he that is Born the
[14:20] flesh is flesh he just born the water
[14:21] water he born this and you know
[14:23] everything coming
[14:24] down he was actually
[14:27] speaking of the
[14:30] fact and to show us that God Almighty
[14:33] himself not a second person right
[14:36] because if it's a second person to it
[14:38] then you got a problem CU you'd have one
[14:40] dying for us and the other one
[14:41] condemning us to hell no you better keep
[14:44] the same God there and understand but
[14:48] see God would make a way by coming down
[14:50] in human
[14:53] flesh and dwelling here with us to be
[14:56] what the scripture would call him
[14:57] Emmanuel God with us amen right not God
[15:01] the son there's no such thing right you
[15:04] can't find that in the scriptures
[15:06] because to see it won't tie up am you
[15:08] won't find the word Trinity in any of
[15:10] your King James translation you might
[15:13] find it in some of these other modern
[15:15] translations today but you won't find it
[15:17] in the original because it doesn't exist
[15:20] all right but
[15:22] now then Jesus would have to explain I'm
[15:25] trying to get to a point where you don't
[15:27] understand what I say in our Sunday
[15:29] that the Everlasting
[15:33] gospel would have to be
[15:35] preached to
[15:37] mankind CU if we're going to get eternal
[15:40] life we have to have the Everlasting
[15:42] gospel right right all right and see in
[15:45] doing that that Everlasting gospel would
[15:48] have to be a message that would relate
[15:51] exactly to what he was
[15:55] doing amen now so then he gets on on
[15:58] over into the scriptures and it says
[16:02] that they're on
[16:05] Calvary when they pierced his
[16:07] side out came
[16:10] water right and
[16:13] blood all
[16:15] right now see that was exactly the thing
[16:18] Jesus was trying to get Nicodemus to
[16:21] see he was trying to tell him look I've
[16:24] got to go
[16:25] die right and he said if you can't
[16:29] understand this natural point that I'm
[16:31] trying to make he said and you are and
[16:34] the original says he was the
[16:37] teacher the teacher the greatest of all
[16:39] of Israel he said and you can't
[16:41] understand what I'm talking about he
[16:43] said how can you understand Heavenly
[16:45] things you know if you can't understand
[16:48] Natural Things see out of the body of
[16:51] Jesus Christ came the elements that
[16:54] would make up the new birth amen all
[16:57] right out of his body body came water
[17:01] blood and life amen right right amen see
[17:06] because that flesh was there no life
[17:09] within it it was gone so out of that
[17:11] would come water blood and
[17:14] life all right now we'll read this in a
[17:17] minute but I'm just trying to make a
[17:19] point in your mind I want you to think
[17:22] about isn't it odd that those things
[17:25] would take
[17:26] place of the water coming out the blood
[17:30] coming
[17:31] out you know the story they couldn't
[17:34] break his leg we know that right the old
[17:37] the custom was that when someone was
[17:38] hanging there and and they were needing
[17:41] for them to die quicker they would just
[17:44] break your legs when they did they just
[17:46] slump down well you drowned in your own
[17:50] inner parts or whatever cut off your
[17:52] breathing and you just
[17:54] die but when they come to Jesus they
[17:56] said no we don't need to to break his
[18:00] legs he's already
[18:02] dead but see some of them standing by
[18:04] said well wait a minute he might be
[18:05] fooling you you know we're paraphrasing
[18:08] cuz you know the Bible not every word
[18:10] not written but said you now wait a
[18:13] minute said you better do something else
[18:14] so they took a spear put it into his
[18:18] side well wouldn't it be an odd
[18:20] situation that they hit exactly to a
[18:24] place now they were hitting his heart
[18:26] right amen right come on he wasn't
[18:29] aiming in his kidneys or his bows or
[18:32] some other place they wouldn't just
[18:34] talkking him to test him they were
[18:36] sinking the spear into his heart right
[18:39] well when they sunk the spear into his
[18:41] heart out came water and blood right see
[18:44] why because he'd already died in agony
[18:47] amen right scientifically speaking they
[18:49] say that you're you can actually come to
[18:52] a place in pain that your water and your
[18:56] your blood will mingle well the
[18:57] scripture says that that he sweat as it
[19:00] were great drops of
[19:03] blood when he was over in the garden of
[19:06] gey see the things were already getting
[19:09] ready to where that when they went to
[19:11] the heart they supposed to get blood
[19:13] right but instead they got water and
[19:15] blood right and out of his body came the
[19:18] elements that would go forth and
[19:22] constitute the new birth all right or
[19:25] make a way for the new birth to come all
[19:28] right then it would make it then it
[19:30] would be an odd situation that's what
[19:32] I'm want you to see I kind of thinking
[19:34] today about it itd be an odd situation
[19:37] to see how
[19:39] that down Through the
[19:42] Ages you had a lot of
[19:44] teachings but is't it odd that Martin
[19:47] Luther would preach that just shall live
[19:50] by faith oh
[19:53] yeah then John Wesley would come
[19:56] along and preach
[20:00] sanctification and then your
[20:02] Pentecostals of zeusa Street 1906 right
[20:06] would come forth preaching the baptism
[20:08] of the Holy Spirit
[20:10] right now is that a
[20:13] coincidence or is that God fulfilling in
[20:16] the natural to show us was it a
[20:20] coincidence back diary that out of his
[20:22] body came
[20:24] these three elements right what water
[20:31] blood and then life amen is it a
[20:35] coincidence that then you would have in
[20:38] the flood the world was washed by
[20:43] water M right right right that's right
[20:48] didn't help it very much did it right
[20:51] but then Jesus when they pierced him his
[20:54] blood fell on the earth to cleanse and
[20:56] claim the Earth right
[20:59] right you know in one of these days the
[21:02] world's going to get a fiery
[21:03] baptism right that's right it's going to
[21:07] cleanse off everything and come and make
[21:09] a place that God and his people can live
[21:12] amen is that
[21:14] coincidental is that something that just
[21:19] happened is it odd then that Luther
[21:22] would preach that just shall live by
[21:27] faith but see then as I trying to bring
[21:29] out Sunday we'll read just in a second
[21:31] what the prophet had to
[21:33] say but see then the Everlasting gospel
[21:36] would be justification
[21:38] right the Bible says the just shall live
[21:43] by faith
[21:45] right Martin Luther they said when he
[21:48] wrote it out he he was reading he wrote
[21:50] right beside of alom in other words
[21:53] that's the only way right that the just
[21:56] can do isn't it OD that the Bible is
[21:59] tied up and coldly speaks of from
[22:02] Genesis to Revelation about faith
[22:06] amen everything is based on
[22:09] faith he that cometh to God must believe
[22:12] that he is
[22:16] amen faith is the anchor of all
[22:20] things right see without faith it's
[22:22] impossible the Bible says that's quoting
[22:24] there to please God right all right
[22:28] there's no way to be born again without
[22:30] faith
[22:33] right see that's what Jesus was trying
[22:36] to place into the hands of Nicodemus
[22:38] what if the man could have had enough
[22:41] understanding to have received it
[22:46] right see to be able to took that and
[22:48] accepted what Jesus said but he couldn't
[22:51] do it see the reason why was because
[22:54] Jesus has never died yet right
[22:58] and see then nobody could come to that
[23:01] place that man needed to come
[23:05] because he had not died
[23:08] right he had not made the
[23:11] way as I said a moment
[23:13] ago for us to be able to understand that
[23:17] you must be born again that's
[23:19] right and there would be no way see for
[23:22] you to do that without the shed
[23:25] blood without the fact that Jesus Christ
[23:28] di amen gave his life that he could come
[23:32] back and live in you and I right right
[23:35] and preach a couple of services there
[23:37] the weekend didn't C the time
[23:40] right I guess I'm kind of like the
[23:42] little boy said about
[23:46] when preacher preached that night they
[23:48] come home
[23:50] and he said I I'm not feeling too good I
[23:52] got a sore throat and the little boy
[23:54] there he said no wonder said you hot
[23:58] you know hollered he said you hollered
[24:00] in the church tonight and said God don't
[24:02] lie for you to holler so
[24:05] maybe maybe that's the way I am maybe
[24:08] don't like for me to holler but think
[24:11] about it
[24:13] then odd
[24:16] coincidences
[24:17] right it's not no odd coincidence to me
[24:20] is it you right amen see Martin Luther
[24:24] started a
[24:26] message that the world was waiting on to
[24:30] fulfill this Angel's message right of
[24:35] the Everlasting
[24:39] gospel see then we can't reject
[24:43] that I believe what Martin Luther taught
[24:47] right right see the
[24:50] truth now not the Trinity he taught not
[24:53] the fact that he would say the Jews were
[24:54] to be took out and be killed no but the
[24:57] message of the day that he brought
[25:00] amen was the just shall live by
[25:03] faith I still believe that today
[25:08] amen and I believe that
[25:10] even like I was showing even the
[25:14] Jews they'll receive this
[25:17] message of the just you live by faith
[25:20] right cuz anything we get from God has
[25:23] to come by
[25:24] faith it can't be an intellectual
[25:27] conception
[25:29] him if it was Jesus Christ died in
[25:33] vain you see he had to give his
[25:36] life forgive me he had to give his life
[25:40] to where you and I would be able to live
[25:43] all right now in doing that
[25:47] then it's easy to understand what is the
[25:51] new
[25:52] birth
[25:55] yes and the days of Mark Luther it was
[25:58] to believe on the Lord Jesus
[26:01] Christ and that was
[26:03] it right the days of John Wesley when
[26:07] they come along that was what would be
[26:08] called a second work of grace even
[26:10] though there's not three works of Grace
[26:12] CU it's the same Holy Ghost justifies
[26:15] you sanctifies you and fills you with
[26:16] the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost but
[26:18] it's just the way we call
[26:20] it so actually they come along preaching
[26:25] sanctification see
[26:30] John the
[26:32] Baptist preached that you must believe
[26:35] on him that was to come that's right is
[26:38] that
[26:39] odd then wouldn't it be an odd thing
[26:42] then again to say
[26:43] that Jesus began to preach and when he
[26:46] did he said the unclean Spirit goth out
[26:49] of a
[26:50] man see that's sanctification right
[26:56] right and then would it be odd to
[26:59] believe that the
[27:02] disciples preached the baptism of the
[27:04] Holy Ghost cuz that's what Peter done on
[27:07] dead Pentecost right he said this is
[27:09] that y it was spoken of by the the the
[27:14] prophets and things right what this is
[27:17] that new
[27:19] birth that Nicodemus couldn't
[27:22] comprehend all right see that it would
[27:25] make it turn out to be what
[27:31] the Everlasting
[27:32] gospel is justification right the only
[27:36] way into the body of
[27:39] Christ is first you must be
[27:43] justified you must repent of your past
[27:48] sins
[27:51] right you don't just walk up shake
[27:53] somebody's hand say I'm born again now
[27:56] I'm I'm too old for for that and you
[27:58] know we we we come from the old school
[28:00] maybe enough to I believe in a definite
[28:02] work of justification I believe in a
[28:04] definite repentance I believe in what
[28:07] the Bible says the goodness of God is
[28:10] what leads you to
[28:11] repent it's not just CA somebody drug
[28:13] you up to the altar that's where
[28:15] people's done it exactly go back in the
[28:17] altar get somebody take them up to the
[28:19] alar say you need to get
[28:20] saved Now where's that in the
[28:24] Bible you can only find it in the
[28:26] Catholic Church
[28:28] yeah when as I say in that Pope got the
[28:31] the decree that he could and wrote a
[28:34] decree back there and said it was better
[28:36] to make people serve God by
[28:39] force than to not serve him in my all
[28:41] you know and that made Millions
[28:45] die for their
[28:47] belief all right but you see then the
[28:50] Everlasting gospel is
[28:56] justification
[28:59] Believing on Jesus
[29:01] Christ accepting him as your
[29:05] savior and
[29:07] repenting
[29:09] amen but see what I find in all of us
[29:12] basically a lot of times is one
[29:16] thing we want to repent for what
[29:18] somebody else
[29:20] done well you know if you ever talk to
[29:23] people say well I'm this way cuz my mama
[29:25] was this way or I'm this way cuz my dad
[29:27] was this
[29:28] way it's my Daddy's fault cuz I a't
[29:31] heard of the nature well you can change
[29:33] that that's
[29:36] right right you change
[29:40] that but you see it's it's repenting for
[29:44] what we
[29:45] done like I always told you was bringing
[29:48] across our minute ago about it it was no
[29:50] Roman spear that killed my
[29:53] savior it was no cross that killed him
[29:58] no Jew didn't kill my savior no Gentile
[30:02] no Roman or nothing didn't kill my
[30:04] savior he died of a broken
[30:06] heart you know why because mankind would
[30:10] not accept him the Bible said he came to
[30:12] his own and his own received him not
[30:15] right but to them that did he gave them
[30:17] power to become the sons of God he
[30:20] putting within them the
[30:22] word that when Pentecost would
[30:25] come the word had to be so down in their
[30:28] hearts
[30:31] MH it's not just walking up to somebody
[30:34] and saying you believe Jesus Christ as
[30:36] your savior yes well you're a
[30:39] Christian no that won't work amen that's
[30:43] just the human knowledge and human
[30:45] knowledge won't save us sure we must
[30:48] have
[30:51] knowledge because the Bible's right when
[30:53] it says faith cometh by hearing that's
[30:55] right and hearing by the word
[30:57] right that's true amen but just because
[31:01] we
[31:06] hear the Bible says the Old Testament
[31:09] Saints Paul in his writing said that
[31:11] they heard but said it not being mixed
[31:14] with faith and them that heard
[31:17] it it didn't do them any
[31:21] good you know there around the time of
[31:24] of Pentecost in the Bible there was a
[31:26] lot of Jews heard the word of God Paul
[31:30] even reasoned daily with them in the
[31:32] synagogues and things and the disciples
[31:34] went everywhere preaching the gospel
[31:36] that's right but you see they couldn't
[31:38] believe
[31:40] it why because it was not mixed with
[31:43] faith
[31:45] right they didn't want to repent of
[31:47] their sins because they didn't think
[31:48] they had any amen right I've told you
[31:51] then and then it was verified by the the
[31:54] the rabbi Richmond and him they believe
[31:57] that circumcision Those Old Testament
[32:00] Jews had been taught and they believe
[32:02] that
[32:03] circumcision put them into a
[32:06] place to where that they were
[32:11] pure because they believe that that was
[32:13] the sinful
[32:15] part and they had that right of what
[32:17] happened in the
[32:20] garden but yet it's because your
[32:22] circumcised doesn't take away the the
[32:25] sin right that's right it was only a
[32:28] natural thing that Abraham had to be
[32:30] circumcised that was a sign of a
[32:32] covenant
[32:34] am that God had already made with him
[32:38] right come on God had done made the
[32:41] Covenant with Abraham in circumcision
[32:43] was just that part in Abraham that made
[32:46] it to where he was displaying to
[32:48] others what he
[32:51] believed that's the way it is in
[32:53] Christianity right right Christianity is
[32:56] not and smoking and drinking and chewing
[32:58] and running around with
[33:00] women that's not
[33:07] Christianity Christianity means a very
[33:09] change of nature right that's what
[33:12] Nicodemus couldn't understand you mean
[33:15] there's something wrong with me I've
[33:17] been told all of my life I'm all
[33:19] right you're telling me I need to be
[33:21] born
[33:25] again but see Jesus was was telling him
[33:27] no I'm trying to tell you I got to go
[33:29] die for
[33:31] you I got to die for your
[33:35] sins but can we believe that he died for
[33:38] us then what is the new
[33:42] birth what is the new
[33:45] birth that would tie together with all
[33:48] of the thoughts of the
[33:51] Bible that you could take Abraham's life
[33:54] and go through the fact of him believing
[33:56] God
[33:57] and then see him over about the 12th
[33:59] chapter that he begins to move on in
[34:01] toward the things and getting in then
[34:03] you see him about 16 and 17 over through
[34:06] there 15 you see him meeting God meeting
[34:09] mzc
[34:15] right but do we really understand
[34:17] justification sanctification and the
[34:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost as to be the
[34:21] new bir right that's
[34:25] right pure you can believe on the Lord
[34:27] Jesus Christ the Bible says
[34:31] that that's what you must do right the
[34:35] Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus
[34:36] Christ Thou shalt be saved right
[34:39] amen but then the Baptist came along and
[34:41] they taught us well all you got to do it
[34:43] just believe it
[34:47] yeah just believe that God died for us
[34:50] and you're
[34:52] saved well now Nicodemus had
[34:55] that
[34:57] Nicodemus put his life on the line hey
[35:00] he was a big ruler yeah he knew he was
[35:03] going to get blackballed in a hurry if
[35:06] they found out what he was
[35:07] doing right and he come to Jesus to ask
[35:11] him
[35:12] about some
[35:15] CL are we willing to put our life on the
[35:18] line are we willing to be associated
[35:21] with the
[35:25] word
[35:29] you see then the
[35:32] disciples it took three and 1 half
[35:35] years of Jesus's
[35:37] Ministry to bring those disciples from
[35:41] what they had been
[35:45] taught right come on now they went to
[35:51] church but they had been taught this is
[35:55] the
[35:55] way
[35:57] just stay here believe in great
[36:02] Jehovah and one day he'll Deliver
[36:07] us but you see Jesus had to preach three
[36:10] and 1/2
[36:11] years it took him a long time to drive
[36:13] that unclean Spirit out of them
[36:16] disciples now that's what he said he
[36:19] said the unclean Spirit goth out of a
[36:20] man walk in dry Places cette come back
[36:22] and find us none you know don't find
[36:25] nothing filled with it
[36:28] y see then as I said isn't it odd that
[36:31] Luther Tau that J shall live by faith
[36:35] and isn't it odd that Wesley taught
[36:38] sanctification the cleansing and setting
[36:40] aside of the
[36:42] person you know that Wesley talked so
[36:44] much on sanctification it even said one
[36:47] day he said ain't no need drinking black
[36:49] coffee he said they ain't nothing in
[36:53] it his house was on fire and he came
[36:56] walking back in according to what I read
[36:57] out of his
[37:00] books he looked up and said well thank
[37:03] you Lord I don't have to worry about
[37:04] that
[37:05] anymore he didn't mean he didn't have to
[37:08] have a house to live in but he had too
[37:10] much tied
[37:12] up so he was thanking the Lord that they
[37:15] set him free from that see those people
[37:18] back there literally
[37:21] believed who was it one of the men down
[37:24] through there was it Moody which one of
[37:26] them was it that raised about 16 17
[37:29] people from the
[37:31] dead one of the Great Men back there
[37:33] wouldn't even read a
[37:37] newspaper Smith Wiggles work wouldn't
[37:40] even read a
[37:42] newspaper why because he was in that
[37:44] time of sanctification coming forth into
[37:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost of ausa
[37:52] Street great people living their lives
[37:56] for God
[37:58] oh and is it odd then you'd come to the
[38:01] zeusa street as I said a moment ago and
[38:03] I that would come forth preaching the
[38:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost true there was
[38:08] a lot of wrong went with it but so
[38:11] what the message of the hours going
[38:14] around the world today there's a lot of
[38:16] wrong with the people in this messag
[38:19] am more than you are out there in
[38:21] organized
[38:22] religion well what does that matter
[38:25] always the scarecrows is where the good
[38:27] fruit is the food is
[38:31] at you don't build a scarecrow out in
[38:33] the in the pyer where the cows is at
[38:37] that's right you put it right over your
[38:40] garden where the good stuff planted you
[38:42] that's right
[38:44] right but I'm just saying isn't it odd
[38:47] but yet it's not odd it's the way God
[38:50] was doing
[38:51] things right because God here in the
[38:54] scripture we just read
[38:58] this first Angel proclaims the
[39:01] Everlasting
[39:03] gospel the just shall live by
[39:06] faith second Angel was talking about
[39:09] Babylon is Fallen it's fallen and
[39:10] different things are happening
[39:14] sanctification then the third
[39:16] Angel was preaching about the mark of
[39:20] the
[39:22] beast right is that a
[39:25] coincidence
[39:27] like I tried to explain to you about it
[39:30] people are looking for the mark of the
[39:32] beast and already have it if you're not
[39:34] born again you're already sealed out
[39:38] anybody will want I in high sense as
[39:39] brother R used to say order to know that
[39:43] that shouldn't take a revelation if
[39:45] you're not born again you're not in the
[39:46] kingdom of God so you don't have the
[39:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have
[39:50] an inside
[39:52] teacher so you're already
[39:55] marked oh yeah one of these days it'll
[39:58] come into the hands and come into your
[39:59] forehead cuz where is your forehead your
[40:01] intelligence and things that's your 666
[40:03] that's your Trinity Doctrine that's in
[40:06] the mind of man around the
[40:10] world
[40:12] right the mark of the beast isn't it odd
[40:15] that a zeusa street begin to preach
[40:17] those things amen then here comes along
[40:21] after them was the prophet brother
[40:22] random picking that up and preaching the
[40:24] mark of the beast the Seal of God the
[40:26] different
[40:28] things and showing us that if we're not
[40:31] born again we already have that
[40:34] Mark don't worry about getting the mark
[40:37] of the beast oh I I I I don't want to
[40:39] get around any other church doctrine I I
[40:42] might get some kind of Mark of the Beast
[40:44] no you're already marked if you're not
[40:45] born
[40:48] again your intelligence intelligence is
[40:51] in your forehead is already filled with
[40:53] a
[40:55] Doctrine
[40:57] seeing Martin Luther like I told you in
[40:59] his soul was a new birth of
[41:03] justification but in his head his mind
[41:06] and things were still
[41:09] motivated by the trinitarian
[41:14] doctrine you said I don't see how that
[41:16] can be well I'm looking at it right and
[41:18] you're looking at it that's right I'm
[41:21] talking about everybody in here okay you
[41:24] want me to call
[41:25] names
[41:28] no matter how much we're born again I
[41:31] we're not born again in our head that's
[41:35] right right we're born again in our
[41:41] soul and them channels between that soul
[41:44] and that head is clogged up by the
[41:46] devil's
[41:47] lies
[41:50] right telling you all you got to do is
[41:52] believe the message of the hour and
[41:53] you're saved now that's a good one isn't
[41:55] it oh yeah
[41:57] M
[41:58] yeah you say well brother D I see you
[42:01] fight that a lot seemingly exactly right
[42:03] because that was the doctrine of the
[42:04] Baptist Church that's where I came from
[42:08] all you got to do is believe you believe
[42:11] Jesus died for you Danny then that means
[42:12] you're saved let's go say it with your
[42:17] mouth I didn't even like to read that
[42:19] scripture I heard it preached on so much
[42:22] I still have trouble sometimes reading
[42:23] it where Paul said you know that you
[42:25] believe in your heart but with the mouth
[42:27] confession is made under salvation kind
[42:29] have heard it preach so
[42:31] wrong and all you got to do is just
[42:34] believe well that means the devil
[42:37] saved right why because he believed the
[42:40] Bible says he did the Bible said he
[42:42] believed and trembled about what he
[42:44] believed now that's scripture go and get
[42:47] your Bible and read a little
[42:51] bit but you
[42:53] see the Everlasting gospel is
[42:56] justification because that's the anchor
[42:57] of all Christianity amen right that's
[43:02] the beginning of all Christianity that's
[43:04] the beginning of the new
[43:07] birth it's
[43:11] justification repentance and asking God
[43:13] to forgive you amen I don't do a thing
[43:16] to your nature you know that if you're
[43:18] in any way at all remember your
[43:21] life a lot of people say boy when I got
[43:23] saved I just believed and I just got
[43:25] filled I've been filled ever since well
[43:28] praise God you're one in a
[43:32] billion there s billion in the world so
[43:35] you're one in a
[43:38] billion cuz that didn't happen in the
[43:40] Bible like
[43:41] that here's Peter and them still
[43:44] wondering if Jesus was the one he was
[43:46] supposed to be
[43:50] right here they were they couldn't get
[43:52] it straightened
[43:54] out finally R it the L Jesus said one
[43:56] day he said now do you finally
[43:59] believe I used to tell about in the
[44:01] Baptist Church I showed that to a
[44:02] Baptist preacher I said the Bible said
[44:04] he that
[44:05] believeth didn't say he that believes
[44:07] and is baptized it said he that
[44:09] believeth keeps on
[44:13] believing you said well what are you
[44:15] trying to explain the New
[44:18] Birth the Pentecostal people who claim
[44:21] the new
[44:23] birth but know nothing about
[44:25] justification sanctification and the
[44:27] baptism of the Holy
[44:31] Ghost tried to preach that in the man's
[44:33] church one
[44:35] time he got offended at me brother in
[44:37] this message cuz all I was doing was
[44:40] just preaching the justification
[44:41] sanation to baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:44] and he was a Pentecostal he was supposed
[44:45] to have that Doctrine before I ever
[44:47] heard of
[44:50] it but you see you can only preach
[44:53] really Truth by what you've experienced
[44:56] amen I couldn't tell you what the new
[44:59] birth is if I hadn't experienced
[45:02] that I couldn't tell you what
[45:04] justification is if I hadn't experi I'd
[45:06] tell you what brother Rand said or what
[45:08] Dev said or what Moody said or Knox or
[45:10] Calvin or Billy gr or somebody or I can
[45:13] tell you all about what they
[45:16] said but I know Church what happened to
[45:19] me
[45:24] right I know what happened to me I was
[45:26] 18 years old before it ever even but yet
[45:29] I saw God when I was 11 years old you've
[45:31] heard me tell that I knew right where he
[45:34] was at and everything but I didn't make
[45:36] that my
[45:40] salvation would you see one day I just
[45:43] had to get over the church to get
[45:46] saved you said well you not talk like
[45:48] that but why not when it's the
[45:52] truth I used to hear hear them tell
[45:54] about what salvation was and
[45:56] and I thought well don't line up and I
[45:58] didn't know how to explain
[46:00] it but I knew there I had had an
[46:05] experience I had repented of my sins I'd
[46:09] asked God to forgive me and it wasn't
[46:11] some preacher telling me what I had to
[46:12] do cuz they didn't really know what to
[46:14] do themselves
[46:17] right and I began to read the Bible and
[46:19] I begin to see about those in the Bible
[46:22] and what it
[46:24] done
[46:26] and I said well that's what it's done to
[46:30] me it made me want to go to
[46:34] church did Brother around say if he's in
[46:36] your heart said you can't waitting the
[46:38] doors
[46:39] open all right that's up to
[46:42] you I just preach what I believe
[46:46] right but you see then one day I seen in
[46:50] the
[46:51] scripture I didn't know anything about
[46:53] Wesley's teaching of sanctification sure
[46:55] I talked to my brother he's a Methodist
[46:59] Minister but my Lord he sure didn't have
[47:02] it he had a you don't think I'm telling
[47:05] the truth his grandkids or kids and all
[47:08] gave him a great big old cabinet to put
[47:10] in his house to put his Playboy
[47:11] magazines
[47:13] in he's a man to dis preacher that's no
[47:19] joke heard him the other day at my
[47:21] sister's funeral and I think it's more
[47:24] religious matter in him now than never
[47:26] been I guess cuz he's about 75 76 years
[47:29] old he's probably concerned about
[47:32] himself but he look like he at least had
[47:34] a sincere heart and begin to believe but
[47:38] listen Church what is the new birth do
[47:41] you have the new birth or are you just
[47:43] basing it on your fact that you believe
[47:45] the prophet's message
[47:48] right have you went through the
[47:50] experience of
[47:51] justification sanctification and the
[47:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's
[47:56] right oh no I got it all at one time now
[47:59] I want to see that in the Bible that
[48:01] that's that's all I ask you I want you
[48:03] to lay out in the Bible and show me
[48:07] that because all the way through the
[48:10] Bible it took three and 1/2 years to get
[48:12] them disciples living with the G with
[48:14] Jesus 24 hours a
[48:17] day 7 days of the
[48:20] week I went to church every day but it
[48:23] took three and a half years to get that
[48:25] unclean drove out of
[48:29] them come on am I
[48:32] right see only then would they be
[48:35] qualified to go to the upper room and
[48:37] receive the baptism of the Holy
[48:43] Ghost because as Jesus was saying about
[48:46] the the scripture you
[48:50] know covering it
[48:53] that some took the word
[48:57] and kept
[48:59] it you Remember The Parables how did
[49:02] some of got Stony ground some got in
[49:04] this place some got in that and it all
[49:05] eats it up and all the birds come and he
[49:07] said some took the word and kept
[49:10] it you know that was the only ones that
[49:12] was there the 120 in the upper room but
[49:15] you know like I've always said you think
[49:18] they ain't odd things in the Bible my
[49:20] Bible tells me that Jesus was seen of
[49:22] over 500 Brethren after his resurrection
[49:28] but only 120 made it to the upper room
[49:31] you know what they were the only ones
[49:34] that knew what was going on
[49:37] right they had seen the dead
[49:39] raised right they had seen him there and
[49:42] they had walked with him and talked with
[49:47] him but yet he wasn't in the upper
[49:51] room
[49:54] why cuz they let the cares of Life they
[49:57] let this happen they let that happen is
[49:59] that what Jesus was explaining I bought
[50:01] a Yola box and I got to go try them I
[50:02] just married a wife can you have me
[50:08] excused see that's what we've all
[50:12] done
[50:14] right are we like Nicodemus trying to
[50:17] understand it from an intellectual
[50:20] conception or we're depending upon God
[50:23] to reveal it to us amen
[50:29] I know it's a carnal way to express it
[50:31] but it does make a point you take a
[50:34] drunk I've never dranked any so I don't
[50:35] know I had to take what other people
[50:37] said but a drunk will see a pink
[50:42] elephant and he run over you with a
[50:44] knife in your hand trying to get away
[50:47] from the Pink
[50:48] Elephant why cuz the Pink Elephant is
[50:51] more real than you
[50:54] are right
[50:58] to him it
[51:00] is the Bible says one day you'll they'll
[51:03] see these great hideous
[51:06] things brother randam your Prophet said
[51:10] it would be because men had long hair
[51:12] and women had cut their hair off and
[51:14] they would see these hideous things amen
[51:18] and it would torment
[51:21] them
[51:24] right
[51:26] but you see the disciples three and 1
[51:28] half
[51:30] years before they could be born
[51:35] again why because the word has got to be
[51:37] planted then then and I know the word
[51:40] ain't ain't supposed to be used in aunt
[51:41] but I'm this country there's nowhere in
[51:44] the Bible that anybody was ever born
[51:46] again that didn't hear the word first
[51:49] right now you show me
[51:52] that cuz the Bible will be wrong then
[51:55] when when it said Faith comth by
[51:57] hearing
[51:58] right so you got to hear the word you
[52:02] got to take that word and hold that word
[52:04] that's
[52:08] right sometimes it's hard
[52:11] yes for 2
[52:14] years I sought a baptism of the Holy
[52:17] Ghost after coming in this
[52:19] message and prior to that I was teaching
[52:22] adult Sunday School classes at 25 years
[52:25] old age and I was a deacon I was
[52:29] everything that could be thought of in
[52:30] the Baptist Church and well thought of
[52:33] my name I found out the other day is
[52:35] still down there written in gold in the
[52:37] bottom of that church because they got
[52:39] all the deacons on one side and all the
[52:42] pastors that had been there on the other
[52:45] side but you see they thought a lot of
[52:47] me cuz I dedicated my
[52:53] life and I found out I wasn't born born
[52:58] again I would to God I could preach
[53:00] tonight hard enough for everybody that
[53:03] I'm looking at and everybody on the
[53:04] Internet is listening that that you'd
[53:06] find out that you're lost right cuz you
[53:08] could do something about it amen
[53:12] right but you sat there looking at me
[53:14] thinking well brother Dale's talking
[53:15] about the New Birth he don't know as
[53:17] much as I know about
[53:19] it well show me in the
[53:24] Bible
[53:26] see three and A2 years it took that took
[53:28] God to drive that word down in their
[53:31] heart amen and only 120 out of all that
[53:34] Hur him was able to go to an upper room
[53:37] and held on to that word long enough cuz
[53:39] what is a new birth it's a birth of the
[53:41] word that's right right no it's an
[53:44] anointing now show me that in the
[53:49] Bible I believe in the anointing I know
[53:52] it's there
[53:54] right
[53:56] but the new birth can't be based on an
[53:58] anointing right cuz David was anointed
[54:01] to kill a giant right in a barer in a
[54:03] line right that's pretty good anointing
[54:07] MH SS in a little bitty
[54:09] runt
[54:11] right was capable of picking up tons of
[54:15] steel of a door out of the ground and
[54:17] walking off with it that's a pretty good
[54:21] anointing that's right Samson take a jaw
[54:24] bone of a an old dried up Jawbone of a
[54:29] donkey and kill a thousand
[54:33] Philistines one lick as the prophet said
[54:35] with that thing would bust it all to
[54:37] pieces but God was in
[54:40] that that's right amen that's all he had
[54:44] all Samson had that he took it and he
[54:46] slew them with it well if we just take a
[54:48] little bit of Faith sometimes and just
[54:50] believe God we' see our sicknesses go
[54:53] down to the drain to just believe
[54:58] it teren s and talking last night about
[55:01] little baby a he running a high
[55:04] temperature sure they took him to the
[55:06] doctor sure they got him medicine thank
[55:07] God for doctors and
[55:09] medicine but the time they got him home
[55:11] and laid down with him a minute he was
[55:13] temperature was broke and he was all
[55:16] right why can't we believe it that way
[55:20] right see we get to the point that we
[55:23] doubt God because he doesn't do for us
[55:25] what he does for
[55:27] others what kind of a child is that
[55:33] am you know m i don't ever remember my
[55:36] mama whing me but I'm sure she did I'm
[55:39] honestly sure she did I just don't never
[55:42] remember but I seen her whoop my brother
[55:45] was 18 years old with a metal ring off
[55:47] of an old wooden
[55:49] barel and all he done was said he was
[55:51] leaving home she said you go back in the
[55:53] house till you calm down then you can
[55:54] leave you ain't leaving
[55:57] mad when she wrapped him with that thing
[56:01] about a couple of times he went in the
[56:02] house and never did
[56:07] leave but you see folks she done him a
[56:10] favor that's right right she done him a
[56:14] great favor
[56:18] sir like I was explaining there the
[56:20] other day those Jews driven to all of
[56:22] the
[56:23] world and God's iner hands of Mercy
[56:27] driving them back to the homelands where
[56:29] he can deal with them in the end time SI
[56:32] over 6 million Jews killed by Ian and
[56:35] Hitler and them to drive them back to
[56:37] the Homeland that's
[56:40] right God was gracious to drive them
[56:42] back because any Jew outside the
[56:44] Homeland is back
[56:45] with come
[56:47] on and any of you and I without the
[56:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost were backslid
[56:51] to start with don't worry about getting
[56:54] back slid don't worry about getting
[56:55] confused that's what people will tell us
[56:57] about the message I'm afraid to talk to
[57:00] you'all about this message I might get
[57:02] confused now you might find out you're
[57:07] confused right see we need to be
[57:09] justified before we can ever be
[57:12] Sanctified amen
[57:14] amen that's right if not we're doing it
[57:17] just like the prophet would say one day
[57:18] he said you can be Sanctified without
[57:20] being justified you know when he says
[57:22] that I'll be glad to give you the quote
[57:24] amen you know
[57:26] why because a lot of people do that
[57:29] without truly being justified and
[57:31] cleansed of God they sanctify themselves
[57:34] and go to church and don't do this and
[57:36] don't do that and they say I don't drink
[57:39] I don't smoke I don't chew I I must be a
[57:41] Christian well what was I when I never
[57:44] done those
[57:48] things but you see when I come in this
[57:50] message and heard that Prophet talking
[57:52] about a new birth I knew I didn't have
[57:54] what he was talking talking about cuz he
[57:56] was talking about a
[58:00] life the new birth is a person of Jesus
[58:02] Christ coming and living in you it's not
[58:06] that justification that's just the work
[58:08] of the holy
[58:09] spirit it's not there at sanctification
[58:12] that's a work of the Holy
[58:14] Spirit that's why you can go that far
[58:16] die and go to
[58:22] hell why because you're not born again
[58:27] you're not born again without the person
[58:28] of Jesus Christ coming and living in you
[58:30] that's
[58:33] right prophet in Christ of Myster God
[58:35] reveals say what is the new word he says
[58:37] the revelation of Jesus
[58:39] Christ personally to you right
[58:43] amen not personally to brother Bram and
[58:46] you heard
[58:51] him we were at a church there was three
[58:54] of us I think it was I know there was
[58:56] three and they were praying for us with
[58:58] about the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[59:01] and the brother he was good
[59:03] brother he got up at night he said I
[59:06] believe every one of you got to baptism
[59:07] of the Holy Ghost
[59:10] tonight
[59:13] well I went home knowing that I didn't
[59:16] get
[59:19] it and the other two that claimed of
[59:22] taking his word for it are no longer in
[59:25] the message
[59:27] right so now you can judge your own
[59:30] Point what you want to on it they turn
[59:32] down this
[59:35] message but you see I didn't take his
[59:38] word because that wouldn't do me any
[59:40] good
[59:42] right I knew what the bible say that no
[59:44] man can call Jesus the Christ except it
[59:46] be by the new birth right cuz I'm only
[59:49] saying what somebody else says right
[59:53] right
[59:55] people in this message are right this
[59:57] day taking what brother random said to
[1:00:00] said I've seen you
[1:00:03] there and they're taking it that brother
[1:00:05] brandom saw them there though so they
[1:00:07] must be
[1:00:09] saved I know I get very I'm I'm I'm the
[1:00:13] the guy that spoils the little eggs you
[1:00:15] know the little things but you know what
[1:00:17] he was inheld and saw people
[1:00:21] right now which one was the one he saw
[1:00:23] me in
[1:00:25] right oh no I was in heaven brother you
[1:00:28] can't tell me no ain't no need
[1:00:34] trying but the actions and reactions
[1:00:36] shows what we are you get upset for me
[1:00:39] by saying that you're not born again you
[1:00:41] know what that just proves you're not
[1:00:42] born again
[1:00:44] right a you got no sense to realize
[1:00:48] that but yet I'm I'm the hateful dirty
[1:00:51] guy and and and you can't tell me I
[1:00:54] ain't SA
[1:00:57] I'm not going to try to you're going to
[1:00:59] tell
[1:00:59] yourself that's right because all I'm
[1:01:02] going to ask you have you been through
[1:01:04] justification as
[1:01:07] repentance and an experience of actually
[1:01:10] God coming to you at that place and
[1:01:13] letting you know that your sins are gone
[1:01:16] I've heard people talk about it as a
[1:01:18] great burden lifting off Brother Gary
[1:01:21] I've heard him talk about he said it
[1:01:23] just like bubble danks and for quite a
[1:01:25] few days and play that's wonderful I
[1:01:27] believe in
[1:01:33] it and he used to tell me and said
[1:01:35] Brother D I think I've got this or that
[1:01:37] I said well you think it ain't no good
[1:01:41] you got to have an experience amen
[1:01:43] that's right
[1:01:46] amen you know one day he called me from
[1:01:49] Alabama he used to call me about once a
[1:01:51] week more than that and say Lord yeah
[1:01:54] Lord this is working out you know Lord
[1:01:56] doing this one day he called me he say
[1:01:58] all settled brother Dale you know to
[1:02:00] this day I ain't had a bit of trouble
[1:02:01] with him about talking about the new
[1:02:05] birth and I holler and scream at him and
[1:02:07] tell him that unless you get the new
[1:02:09] birth you're
[1:02:10] lost and you sat there and say
[1:02:14] Amen well what do you do with
[1:02:22] it we don't have the excuse that
[1:02:24] Nicodemus
[1:02:26] did because at that time God had not
[1:02:30] made himself into manifestation that he
[1:02:33] could pay the price right right right he
[1:02:37] had not died on Calvary right
[1:02:43] right the
[1:02:45] church we're not back in the days of
[1:02:47] Martin Luther when it was just to live
[1:02:50] and believe and
[1:02:53] die
[1:02:55] the prophet of God said what he said the
[1:02:57] last three
[1:02:59] ages the messages of each age completed
[1:03:02] to
[1:03:03] birth I said isn't it odd that Luther
[1:03:06] preached justification Wesley preached
[1:03:08] sanctification and a Pentecostal preach
[1:03:10] the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:13] Ghost you know that John Wesley called
[1:03:16] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:18] Ghost his own
[1:03:20] writings and it was for that time amen
[1:03:27] but see now we must be justified
[1:03:29] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:03:31] Ghost that's right that's
[1:03:35] right you see church I made this plans
[1:03:37] earlier in the week I'm not just
[1:03:40] preaching to somebody that's
[1:03:44] come get that off your
[1:03:46] mind I made the plans to preach this
[1:03:49] message earlier in the
[1:03:51] week to follow after the the message
[1:03:54] that I brought Sunday of the Everlasting
[1:03:57] gospel I've already got two sermons
[1:03:59] wrote down to go with I don't even have
[1:04:01] to study for
[1:04:04] Sunday but you see this kept coming it
[1:04:06] kept
[1:04:10] coming you've been here long enough to
[1:04:13] know what I teach about the New Birth
[1:04:17] those disciples took that word that
[1:04:19] Jesus brought amen and that word
[1:04:21] cleansed them I thought we believe we
[1:04:24] were Washed by the Water of the word I
[1:04:26] thought we believe the
[1:04:31] scriptures that unclean Spirit was
[1:04:33] driven out of
[1:04:36] them and they went to the upper room to
[1:04:40] wait sure we know the story they get in
[1:04:42] the upper room and they say well I think
[1:04:44] we've got it let's just take it by faith
[1:04:46] but somebody had enough G to stand up
[1:04:48] and say well we ain't got what he
[1:04:51] said when is the preachers of this
[1:04:53] message going to tell their congregation
[1:04:55] you ain't got what they what you think
[1:04:56] you got you know the blood's going to be
[1:04:59] on their
[1:05:00] hands it's not going to be on mine cuz
[1:05:03] I've told
[1:05:04] you I ain't going to have to I may have
[1:05:06] to answer for a lot of things but it
[1:05:08] won't be for not telling you what the
[1:05:10] new birth is and what that you need to
[1:05:12] be born again it's
[1:05:15] true well I'm just good I go to church
[1:05:17] whatever you want me to do won't you get
[1:05:19] born
[1:05:22] again won't you get born again yes Lord
[1:05:26] talking to the car pror today about
[1:05:29] it I said why is it that people can't
[1:05:31] have an experience with
[1:05:35] God it takes them to a place that they
[1:05:38] can stand all the troubles and
[1:05:41] things what's the matter with us
[1:05:46] right but you see that's the trouble of
[1:05:48] the people this mess you they go good
[1:05:50] for a little
[1:05:51] while right you see them come in and
[1:05:55] this let go good for a while and I like
[1:05:57] I tell you it's like a candle burning at
[1:05:59] both
[1:06:02] ends while that's going to burn
[1:06:05] out then you see them drift right back
[1:06:07] where they come from or go back to a
[1:06:09] worship place man it stood right here
[1:06:11] and preach years
[1:06:14] ago right here in this church and preach
[1:06:16] years
[1:06:18] ago because of the fact of what was
[1:06:21] happened related to the to the different
[1:06:24] about the the where brother Brandon was
[1:06:26] hunting out
[1:06:28] there he
[1:06:30] backslid he went back to the
[1:06:32] denominational church if you want to see
[1:06:35] him on the your YouTube you can pull him
[1:06:37] up look at what you call it Facebooks or
[1:06:40] what that's on there you can see him and
[1:06:42] his

[1:06:47] proud I ain't going to get on
[1:06:49] Facebook I'm not proud the way I
[1:06:53] look
[1:06:55] but see people are so proud they got
[1:06:57] their little shorts on and their haircut
[1:06:59] off and then they're so proud they're
[1:07:05] liberated I didn't know I was ever
[1:07:10] B right you know that those Jews didn't
[1:07:14] believe they were in bondage go back and
[1:07:16] read your
[1:07:17] Bible they said we're never in bondage
[1:07:20] to no man right there they were under
[1:07:23] the Roman author
[1:07:24] being
[1:07:25] killed see they didn't believe it amen
[1:07:29] they believe they was
[1:07:32] free we go over cook the Seas and we
[1:07:35] liberate them
[1:07:36] women and the next time you see them
[1:07:38] what have they got painted face and ha
[1:07:40] cut off running down through the bars
[1:07:42] and strip naked did we liberate
[1:07:48] them
[1:07:49] oh but listen Church what is the new
[1:07:52] birth
[1:07:54] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:07:57] of the Holy
[1:08:02] Ghost I knew that my experience of
[1:08:05] justification was
[1:08:07] true because I had experienced
[1:08:11] it I had seen God I had talked to him I
[1:08:14] had felt him so
[1:08:20] close but yet when the prophet began to
[1:08:23] explain the new birth I knew I had
[1:08:26] missed
[1:08:28] it cuz I was putting it on some feelings
[1:08:31] or ideas and feelings are
[1:08:36] wonderful look feelings without the
[1:08:38] truth is
[1:08:39] satanic right do what you want to with
[1:08:42] it I shouted I cried I spoke in
[1:08:45] tongues you want me to give you a quote
[1:08:48] I just run it off a minute ago brother
[1:08:49] around said you're Pentecostal say I
[1:08:51] spoke in tongues he said and deny the
[1:08:55] birth of the
[1:08:58] word he didn't pull no
[1:09:04] bone the prophet said it like this and
[1:09:06] you've heard it I've got them laying
[1:09:07] here if you want these notes you're
[1:09:08] welcome to it he said false prophets
[1:09:12] produce false births amen he said true
[1:09:15] prophets produce true births the birth
[1:09:18] of the word
[1:09:20] amen what is the New Birth the birth of
[1:09:22] the word who is he I thought my Bible
[1:09:25] said in the beginning was the word the
[1:09:27] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:09:29] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:09:30] Among Us that's what I thought the Bible
[1:09:32] say so then we need we're supposed to be
[1:09:35] word children
[1:09:38] right not intellectual
[1:09:41] Giants Amen on that that's but word
[1:09:44] children
[1:09:47] amen I sitting after all these years of
[1:09:51] studying and doing setting today just
[1:09:52] going on through read reading the book
[1:09:54] of Revelation sitting there just wait
[1:09:56] said God thank you for showing the truth
[1:09:59] I can read these things now and they
[1:10:01] just make beautiful sense to me yeah
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:08] amen sister said the other day she said
[1:10:11] the prophet said it we read the Bible
[1:10:13] but said when you explained it said it's
[1:10:14] a whole L better well that's all I'm
[1:10:17] trying to do right
[1:10:19] amen would you just explain this about
[1:10:21] the New Birth cuz what is the New Birth
[1:10:23] the birth of the word what is this Mark
[1:10:25] of the
[1:10:27] Beast to reject the
[1:10:33] word right right you reject the words
[1:10:36] you're automatically marked with the
[1:10:37] mark of the beast the others comes later
[1:10:39] where you buying and
[1:10:43] selling but it's pretty close
[1:10:46] now cuz you can't buy and sale now
[1:10:48] without a social security
[1:10:51] card if you do you buy findy it from
[1:10:54] some other point but they automatically
[1:10:55] want something they want your telephone
[1:10:57] number or whatever now before you can
[1:10:59] make a
[1:11:01] transaction it's pretty
[1:11:04] close but you see the prophet go to the
[1:11:07] Future home and read what he saids it's
[1:11:10] in the notes here if you want
[1:11:12] it he said justification does nothing to
[1:11:15] your only chops off your pie sins it
[1:11:19] does nothing to your nature
[1:11:22] right those disciples had that same
[1:11:25] nature walking right there with the Lord
[1:11:26] Jesus that they started out with you
[1:11:29] want the scripture for it did not the
[1:11:32] very man that we put our emphasis on the
[1:11:34] day of Pentecost coming with the word
[1:11:36] did not Jesus say to Peter one day get
[1:11:38] behind me
[1:11:40] Satan is that
[1:11:43] Bible why because he knew that was the
[1:11:46] devil talking it wasn't Peter right
[1:11:51] amen see you can't the Bible said you
[1:11:54] cannot see the kingdom without the new
[1:11:56] birth right see means to understand not
[1:11:59] see
[1:12:01] like understand yes
[1:12:06] Lord sanctification is when that unclean
[1:12:09] Spirit go out of a man and you know the
[1:12:12] easiest way to find out whether the
[1:12:13] unclean spirit is gr out of a man or not
[1:12:16] pretty good
[1:12:18] way I ain't going to do it but pretty
[1:12:20] good way to find
[1:12:22] out
[1:12:25] you know I don't know where that got
[1:12:27] that on there not but I sure didn't
[1:12:30] hit that's a good way to find
[1:12:33] out let somebody hit you you'll find out
[1:12:35] what you are right let somebody cross
[1:12:38] you you'll find out what you are you can
[1:12:40] see where the unclean spirit's gone out
[1:12:42] or
[1:12:43] not that when your enemies can hang you
[1:12:46] on a tree and you still pray for her
[1:12:49] amen can you do
[1:12:52] that
[1:12:53] can you pray for the people who lambast
[1:12:56] you and make fun of you and lied about
[1:12:58] what you preach and
[1:13:00] everything can you pray for them then
[1:13:03] you're not born
[1:13:09] again prophet of God said one day what
[1:13:11] he said now if you want to know the
[1:13:13] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said let's
[1:13:14] get here in the
[1:13:18] Bible
[1:13:21] right where was it Zeki
[1:13:23] about the rider's inkhorn go through and
[1:13:26] Mark and Mark those that are signning
[1:13:28] and cry for the Abomination done in the
[1:13:33] city he said that's a good way to tell
[1:13:35] whether or not you're born
[1:13:37] again can you truthfully forgive
[1:13:40] someone that does anything against
[1:13:45] you even though they don't ask
[1:13:49] you easy to give somebody to ask you M
[1:13:54] what if they don't ask
[1:13:57] you can you forgive
[1:14:01] them well we'll never come to the
[1:14:03] rightly in Mark 11 CU Mark 11 words
[1:14:06] speaking of if you say to this mountain
[1:14:09] you better read on down about to 25 I
[1:14:11] think it is but somewhere right along in
[1:14:14] there it says if we don't forgive we
[1:14:15] won't be
[1:14:21] forgiven amen H right that's right if we
[1:14:26] don't forgive we can't be forgiven
[1:14:27] that's right see that's the nature of
[1:14:29] Christ you know what Christ was trying
[1:14:31] to do to show the disciples the nature
[1:14:33] that they needed to have
[1:14:35] right right come on was that right he
[1:14:39] was trying to show them the nature they
[1:14:40] needed to
[1:14:45] have and they couldn't understand
[1:14:49] it they knew that he could
[1:14:52] just
[1:14:54] and everything would be
[1:14:57] gone what about them hanging around Paul
[1:15:00] when he got over
[1:15:02] there oh Paul used to turn around in S
[1:15:05] turn him over to
[1:15:09] S but then one day he got to wor it
[1:15:11] looked like he couldn't do
[1:15:13] nothing you know what he was the
[1:15:15] crowning crowning day of his
[1:15:19] ministry but yet it looked like the
[1:15:21] worst day he' ever had you know the
[1:15:23] crowning day of Jesus's Ministry that
[1:15:25] proved he was a Christian was the day he
[1:15:27] hung on the tree for me right
[1:15:31] amen that's when he proved he was a
[1:15:35] Christian are we willing to be on a tree
[1:15:39] Paul said I would that I could be a cast
[1:15:41] away from my
[1:15:43] people and only after saying that did
[1:15:46] God speak to him and say all Israel will
[1:15:50] be saved
[1:15:52] Paul
[1:15:55] come on read your
[1:15:58] Bible not every Israelite but the Israel
[1:16:01] of God will be saved cuz Paul prayed for
[1:16:05] him can you pray for your
[1:16:07] enemies can you pray for them that
[1:16:09] despitefully use you and that's what the
[1:16:11] scripture
[1:16:13] say so what is the new birth then
[1:16:16] justification choing off your pie sins
[1:16:19] sanctification being cleansed and set
[1:16:21] aside by the words you hear
[1:16:24] right same as identical with the
[1:16:28] disciples and then the baptism of the
[1:16:30] Holy
[1:16:32] Ghost the new birth yes which is Christ
[1:16:35] in you the nature of Christ The Life of
[1:16:39] Christ the very soul of almighty God
[1:16:42] coming into you by the New
[1:16:50] Birth the very life of almighty God
[1:16:53] that would die for those who were
[1:16:56] persecuted
[1:16:59] amen well a man done at work one day he
[1:17:01] said Jesus had long hir I can have long
[1:17:04] high I said if you'll show the nature of
[1:17:06] Jesus Christ I won't say one word about
[1:17:08] your
[1:17:11] heart that's what I told
[1:17:15] you said I won't say one word about your
[1:17:19] life I won't say a thing in the world
[1:17:21] about a woman that shows the nature of
[1:17:23] Jesus
[1:17:24] Christ cuz you know you ain't going to
[1:17:26] do
[1:17:27] it unless you're born again if you're
[1:17:29] born again it's automatically going to
[1:17:31] be a LIF lived
[1:17:35] right you you don't have to worry about
[1:17:37] a man where you got a highcut or not you
[1:17:39] don't have to wear woman about where she
[1:17:40] cuts her high or not if she's a
[1:17:41] Christian right those that keep cutting
[1:17:44] her High ain't Christians amen even the
[1:17:48] Little M off a little thing little
[1:17:50] you're not a
[1:17:52] Christian
[1:17:54] but see the new birth is the Life of
[1:17:56] Christ coming in it's not a Doctrine you
[1:17:58] know a doctrine of of brother of random
[1:18:00] I believe everything he
[1:18:03] says read Christ a Myster of God
[1:18:06] revealed but brother brand will tell you
[1:18:09] that it's Christ revealed in you that's
[1:18:11] the new birth amen
[1:18:16] amen The Life of
[1:18:19] Christ Living in
[1:18:21] US
[1:18:24] that's the effect or the what do you
[1:18:26] call it the production or the the coming
[1:18:29] forth from the just shall live by faith
[1:18:32] right so we're still saying
[1:18:36] that we're still still talking about
[1:18:39] that just shall live by
[1:18:41] faith you know the Lutheran says we're a
[1:18:44] bunch of fanatical
[1:18:46] nuts Antichrist is never you know what
[1:18:49] we say we say we believe what Luther
[1:18:51] t that's Luther talked to just you live
[1:18:55] by
[1:19:01] faith what is
[1:19:05] anywh the same God that walked the
[1:19:07] shores of Galilee you got to be living
[1:19:10] inside of
[1:19:12] you if it ain't we're going to argue and
[1:19:14] fuss about it right
[1:19:17] right we're going to grab and
[1:19:21] complain until that happen
[1:19:27] right see brother Dale but you're
[1:19:30] telling me that I'm not born again I
[1:19:32] wish I could I wish that God I could
[1:19:35] tell you that enough to get you to
[1:19:36] believe it and do something about it
[1:19:39] amen amen
[1:19:42] right brother accused me of the saying
[1:19:44] that one time he said I said something
[1:19:46] to about this brother was went to church
[1:19:48] here and I said a Christian don't act
[1:19:50] like
[1:19:51] that he went away and told everybody
[1:19:54] that I said he wouldn't a Christian I
[1:19:55] didn't do it I said a Christian wouldn't
[1:19:57] act like
[1:20:00] that now if he's going to go act like
[1:20:03] that then he was one admitting he wasn't
[1:20:05] a Christian I didn't have anything to do
[1:20:08] with
[1:20:09] it but you see him until this day he
[1:20:11] won't come back why cuz he went
[1:20:15] somewhere where somebody tell him it was
[1:20:16] a chrisan that's the way they doing this
[1:20:18] message
[1:20:20] right I mean in this message you just
[1:20:22] find your church to go to to tell you're
[1:20:23] all
[1:20:27] right you shop around a little while
[1:20:29] you'll find you
[1:20:32] one they'll say everything's
[1:20:37] okay
[1:20:43] righten but you see following up from
[1:20:45] the Everlasting
[1:20:50] gospel the way today the only way the
[1:20:53] judge can live by faith is by the
[1:20:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:20:57] now I'm ending with this statement the
[1:20:59] only way you can be truly
[1:21:03] Justified is to have the new
[1:21:07] bir talking with somebody the other day
[1:21:09] about it where that they showed me where
[1:21:11] brother brandham had actually in this
[1:21:13] brother in his church had put this out
[1:21:15] about to do it brother R says the the
[1:21:18] justifica that the the new birth and the
[1:21:21] baptism is two different things
[1:21:24] I got that quote you want it be glad to
[1:21:27] look at it with
[1:21:29] you he said I can conclusively prove
[1:21:32] that you're born again by Believing on
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ and then baptized into the
[1:21:40] body
[1:21:41] amen what's he teaching
[1:21:46] adoption that's what we're going to get
[1:21:47] on in this Saturday right
[1:21:51] adoption you're born into the
[1:21:56] family but that don't make you an
[1:21:58] adopted manifested son or daughter of
[1:22:01] God right the growth development the
[1:22:04] stature of a perfect man has to be
[1:22:06] involved right see you do start your
[1:22:09] salvation by believing amen if it's
[1:22:12] truly
[1:22:14] justification right now you understand
[1:22:16] that I've explained justification for an
[1:22:19] hour now right the Everlasting gospel
[1:22:22] for an hour that everything's based on
[1:22:28] faith then where would it be any problem
[1:22:30] with what I just
[1:22:33] said you start your Christianity when
[1:22:36] you start
[1:22:38] believing and As Long as You Keep On
[1:22:41] Believing God's going to keep coming to
[1:22:43] you that's right until one
[1:22:45] day now what if Brother Gary would have
[1:22:48] been when I told him one day about
[1:22:50] the he was talking to me he was studying
[1:22:53] on the
[1:22:55] godhead and I said Brother Gary you're
[1:22:57] trying to figure it out I'm talking
[1:22:59] about Brother Gary cuz he didn't get mad
[1:23:01] at
[1:23:02] me I said you can't figure it out
[1:23:05] brother you're going to go crazy trying
[1:23:07] to figure it
[1:23:08] out you wait and let him reveal it right
[1:23:12] and he'll reveal it to you right sister
[1:23:15] G when he says that ain't nothing but
[1:23:17] one do well you know that's all it takes
[1:23:20] we don't have to have W BL blang blang
[1:23:22] all over her head and running out her
[1:23:23] earbobs and I mean ear loes and
[1:23:26] everything else to have a
[1:23:29] revelation it's just believing God right
[1:23:34] and taking him at his word amen that's
[1:23:38] right he said it and I believe it
[1:23:41] amen now I want him to reveal it that's
[1:23:45] right right but if I stop
[1:23:50] believing right
[1:23:53] well brother D I've been believe in a
[1:23:55] long time and and I'm just just having
[1:23:57] problems I've been believeing we poor
[1:24:00] little
[1:24:02] baby you're not going to get no sympathy
[1:24:04] out of me on that because babies have
[1:24:07] got to go through growing
[1:24:08] up you know
[1:24:10] what you know the only way a baby gets
[1:24:13] anything to eat is
[1:24:15] cry you know the only way that it is
[1:24:17] like I've always told you isn't it
[1:24:19] something how many of you remember this
[1:24:21] in your Christian experience come on
[1:24:23] musician you remember when you used to
[1:24:25] when you first got converted that you
[1:24:27] asked God for anything he just give it
[1:24:28] to you he just poured it out on you
[1:24:32] right then one day you ask him and you
[1:24:35] didn't get it right you said wait a
[1:24:38] minute now what's
[1:24:40] wrong what's wrong
[1:24:43] Lord you ask him again you don't get
[1:24:46] it you got a child train you
[1:24:51] amen would it be something for your kids
[1:24:53] to come along to you and they come up
[1:24:55] every day and say daddy I'm I
[1:24:59] D you born for Mom and
[1:25:05] Daddy you come back
[1:25:07] and am i
[1:25:10] d i mean a while I'd get upset with that
[1:25:13] wouldn't you and I say son who do you
[1:25:15] think you
[1:25:18] are I put a little sting on they don't
[1:25:22] ask me that question
[1:25:25] again cuz if you're that dumb there's
[1:25:27] something wrong with you we need to take
[1:25:28] you to the mental
[1:25:30] institution we got all the signs and
[1:25:32] everything else we got your birth
[1:25:33] certificate we got everybody in the
[1:25:34] country knows who you
[1:25:36] are why you keep doubting who we
[1:25:41] are right well you know what my point is
[1:25:45] this when God tells you something and
[1:25:47] you read it in the word just take that
[1:25:50] and stand right there
[1:25:55] amen and he don't bother you at all
[1:25:58] reminding him of
[1:26:01] things you say Lord I've repented of my
[1:26:04] sins I've tried to study your word to
[1:26:06] let it cleanse and sanctify me and take
[1:26:08] away my Deeds that I done in the body
[1:26:10] you know I quit this I quit that because
[1:26:11] the word said
[1:26:13] to that you said you'd give me the Holy
[1:26:19] Ghost he says that's my child
[1:26:24] just stay right
[1:26:25] there that's what I've done two
[1:26:28] years I everybody in the country to pray

[1:26:45] don't
[1:26:46] either he said I don't think you're the
[1:26:48] kind of seeking signs and wonders to
[1:26:50] prove that you're saved I said no ain't
[1:26:52] got nothing to do with it you know
[1:26:54] what he said but this one
[1:26:58] thing says God is his
[1:27:02] word
[1:27:05] right and said what he says is
[1:27:10] true he said he'd give you the baptism
[1:27:12] of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] right he said now just accept
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:23] but I didn't go around and tell
[1:27:24] everybody I got it I got it that's fine
[1:27:27] if you do I hope you do but see God come
[1:27:30] down one
[1:27:32] day my wife and I both received the
[1:27:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same night

[1:27:39] other she fell under a drunk's feet had
[1:27:43] get some things put on her that drunk
[1:27:46] was looking at her he was a drunk
[1:27:47] sitting on front row in the church he
[1:27:50] was just looking at her
[1:27:53] but you see something was
[1:27:57] settled well did you see VES did you see
[1:27:59] dreams did you speak in tongu you shout
[1:28:01] no no no no I saw
[1:28:07] God not even like I saw him when I was
[1:28:09] 11 years old right and I saw him in his
[1:28:17] word he was staring at me through his
[1:28:20] word I love that picture word it just
[1:28:22] got Christ standing in the word dra out
[1:28:25] you know with the letter that's

[1:38:26] anything I believe anything I can see
[1:38:29] and can
[1:38:32] prove I

[1:38:38] believe because they got to have
[1:38:40] something to hold on
[1:38:42] to you know what brother R said if you
[1:38:45] got to have something to hold on God be
[1:38:46] good enough he said they needed

[1:38:50] tongues
[1:38:52] to hold on to
[1:38:54] it why can't you believe it yes I've
[1:38:58] seen these little kids here do it and
[1:39:00] you've seen
[1:39:01] it I've took out a $20 bill and laid out
[1:39:04] before one of these kids here have done
[1:39:06] it many times and say you believe I'll
[1:39:08] give you
[1:39:09] that and you know they don't doubt me at
[1:39:13] all right they don't doubt me they
[1:39:16] believe I give it to them and I
[1:39:19] do that's not trying to buy something or
[1:39:21] pay it off or it's just making a contact
[1:39:25] to see if you can believe
[1:39:27] me that I would do anything I could to
[1:39:30] try to help you how much more confidence
[1:39:33] have you got in believing a God that
[1:39:36] cannot fail cuz I can fail and not be
[1:39:38] able to take care of my commitments or
[1:39:40] whatever but God
[1:39:42] can't just believe it just say thank you
[1:39:45] Lord yes
[1:39:48] do Brother Ray the other day with his
[1:39:50] arm and we done would you s Lord just
[1:39:53] reach down and take this problem away
[1:39:54] from it and you know it just went
[1:39:57] away well all I got to do is just say
[1:40:01] thank you Lord hallelujah I love you
[1:40:03] thank you
[1:40:06] Hallelujah if not why you going to
[1:40:09] pray I mean do you think you got to do
[1:40:11] something I was talking to that
[1:40:13] chiropractor today and he said people
[1:40:14] thinks they got to do something to get
[1:40:16] God on their side I said yeah you can't
[1:40:18] never do nothing don't never try to
[1:40:20] appease God
[1:40:21] that's that's going worse than
[1:40:23] Catholicism that's on back to the total
[1:40:25] po when they offered their kids you
[1:40:29] know would give their kids up to an
[1:40:31] alligator because they believe that was
[1:40:33] a
[1:40:34] God don't TR to appease God just ask
[1:40:39] you and I like the way the prophet said
[1:40:41] it one day he said a know from God is
[1:40:44] greater than any El you could think
[1:40:47] of do you know that the Bible says that
[1:40:50] those people there the children of
[1:40:52] Israel they asked for
[1:41:00] meat right come on are you in the Bible
[1:41:03] they had to man never to ask for meat
[1:41:05] you know why the meat was in
[1:41:07] teeth that's right God killed
[1:41:11] him be careful what you asked it might
[1:41:14] destroy
[1:41:16] you don't ask a
[1:41:18] Miss but ask believe
[1:41:21] say thank you Father we thank you for
