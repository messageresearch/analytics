[9:28] way the word was made flesh boy can see
[9:30] now and the Word was made flesh and
[9:33] dwelt among us and what
[9:35] we we beheld his glory I see his glory
[9:39] today I saw his glory yesterday we had
[9:41] fun with with different ones from
[9:42] different churches that were that were
[9:44] gathered together to for the uh for the
[9:46] ceremony and we always you always get
[9:48] together with you and especially the
[9:51] bride and you get to talking to them
[9:52] they say well you know that yeah I know
[9:53] that guy well I'm kin to this one well
[9:55] we're just all one big family in this in
[9:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ you know you
[9:58] start talking about somebody yeah I know
[10:00] that person so that's the way we are we
[10:02] beheld his glory and I see his glory and
[10:04] that's what he's looking at us today
[10:05] he's looking at his glory because we are
[10:07] his glory we are his victory
[10:09] as of the only begotten of the father
[10:12] Grace and truths second Peter 1 verse
[10:14] five and this is where we've got the
[10:16] whole the whole point is besides this
[10:18] giving all diligence add to your faith
[10:20] virtue diverse your knowledge and all
[10:22] his Temperance Temperance patience to
[10:24] patience godliness and the godliness
[10:26] brotherly kindness
[10:28] and to brotherly kindness charity first
[10:31] Timothy 3 16 says that without
[10:33] controversy in other words without
[10:35] don't give me another book
[10:37] give me the Bible
[10:39] without controversy great is the mystery
[10:42] of godliness God was manifest In the
[10:45] Flesh justified in the spirit scene of
[10:47] angels preached into the Gentiles
[10:49] believed only in the world and received
[10:51] up into glory and guess what he came
[10:54] back into me and you so you may be
[10:55] seated and the Lord had his Blessing to
[10:57] the reading of the word and that word
[10:59] controversy is without dispute it's
[11:03] without quarreling
[11:04] we understand now the total Plan of
[11:07] Redemption because God sent a prophet in
[11:08] the end time and he helped us to see
[11:12] that what was in the mind of God it
[11:15] wasn't a Baptist or a Methodist or a
[11:17] Pentecostal idea or minding your own
[11:19] idea it was I it was not an idea an idea
[11:23] is something you can you can kind of uh
[11:26] uh you can dispute an idea
[11:28] but you can't dispute fact the fact is
[11:32] God came himself as a human being gave
[11:35] his life on Calvary died and resurrected
[11:38] came back on the day of Pentecost into a
[11:41] group of Believers and he's been doing
[11:43] that ever since and he built this church
[11:45] on that so as he built that church on
[11:48] that man has interjected their own ideas
[11:51] down Through the Ages and as man
[11:54] interjected their ideas it's it's not
[11:56] made the word uh wrong it's made what we
[12:00] thought wrong the words never changed
[12:02] the word's never wrong all right
[12:05] so now let's go to Romans 8 29 so how
[12:08] how do you know all this is going on how
[12:10] do you know that we're in the right
[12:12] place how do you know that we got the
[12:14] right Bible
[12:15] uh because we under we believe there's a
[12:18] God
[12:19] there's a superior being somewhere that
[12:21] knows way more than me and you do right
[12:25] for whom he did for no so in other words
[12:28] that he had knowledge beforehand that we
[12:30] would be here on Earth and he could
[12:32] predetermine
[12:34] us to be here at this time to be
[12:37] conformed to the image of his son so
[12:38] we've got to be conformed not to the
[12:40] image of the world but the image of his
[12:41] son all right everybody with me am I
[12:44] going too fast Brother Anderson said I
[12:45] might be going a little bit too fast so
[12:46] I'll slow down a little bit okay
[12:49] moreover a whom he did predestinate then
[12:52] he also called
[12:54] you got called that's why you're sitting
[12:56] here today there was a call came out
[12:58] that said hey I want you to be my child
[13:02] I want you to be my son I want you to be
[13:04] my daughter
[13:05] and I don't want you just to sit and
[13:06] appeal and die I want to use you I want
[13:09] you to be someone that is that is used
[13:12] you apart
[13:16] oh pause I'm sorry okay and whom he
[13:20] called
[13:21] then he also Justified I'm sorry
[13:24] and whom he justified he also glorified
[13:26] so in other words he finished the work
[13:28] he started it so he's going to finish it
[13:30] amen if he started it it's got to be
[13:33] right
[13:34] all right so
[13:36] we were talking yesterday a couple of
[13:38] brothers and I we were talking about if
[13:40] it had not been for Grace think about
[13:42] this they had not been for Grace where
[13:44] would you and I be I mean listen we
[13:46] always think
[13:48] and I'm going to get into this in just a
[13:49] minute but for those of you that are
[13:51] that are that are new maybe uh you're
[13:54] looking you look at the world and you
[13:55] see Lord the thing that happened in
[13:57] Texas yesterday and shooting everywhere
[14:00] and so we live in an imperfect world we
[14:04] all know that right but God has
[14:06] commissioned for a group of people to be
[14:08] perfect
[14:10] now if he commissioned a group of people
[14:12] to be perfect he's got to make a way for
[14:15] us to be perfect
[14:16] now perfect is not that I'm gonna not
[14:19] miss one word today
[14:22] I'm not going to to misspeak a word I'm
[14:26] not going to interject it's just going
[14:29] to be perfect
[14:31] no that's not perfect there's not when
[14:33] you go and get in the car and you go
[14:34] down the road and and every stop light
[14:37] turns to Green
[14:39] if that happens praise the Lord but but
[14:42] if it don't don't say Lord what's wrong
[14:45] no that's just human beings that's what
[14:48] we were talking about yesterday there is
[14:49] a part of us that's just human
[14:51] we're just human we live in a human body
[14:53] we live in a human world that is
[14:55] imperfect and your body is according to
[14:57] flesh is imperfect the Bible tells us
[15:00] that but when Jesus said be therefore
[15:02] perfect he had to make a way for us
[15:04] somewhere in our person in our body our
[15:08] spirit or our soul somewhere we've got
[15:10] to be perfect now if you're born again
[15:12] today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:14] you are perfect in your soul actually
[15:16] you're not perfect you're God and God is
[15:19] perfect
[15:20] okay you're not a second person you are
[15:22] you have a peace or a part of God you
[15:25] have a peace or a part of the ocean if
[15:27] it's just a spoonful same chemicals as
[15:29] what was in the ocean that great big
[15:32] four-fifths of the world is covered in
[15:34] water if you've got a teaspoon of it
[15:36] you've got all the elements that's in
[15:37] that whole ocean well guess what when
[15:40] you get born again you get that teaspoon
[15:42] or as brother Ram tells us that little
[15:44] button in your soul that is your light
[15:47] as brother Joe was talking about we the
[15:50] Bible tells us to be the light of the
[15:51] world
[15:52] in this darkness of what this chaos of
[15:55] what's going on
[15:56] it's just by the grace of God that you
[15:58] and I are sitting here today how many of
[16:00] us consent and testify that that we were
[16:02] this far from dying we were this close
[16:05] for somebody hitting us and killing us
[16:07] or or me taking the wrong medicine or me
[16:10] going the wrong direction or everybody
[16:13] if you think back in your life there is
[16:15] at least one time in your life that
[16:17] you're like
[16:18] I am glad that didn't happen or I'm glad
[16:21] I didn't go down that road or I'm glad I
[16:23] didn't do this that or the other right
[16:25] so what was that
[16:27] well that was just luck no I don't
[16:29] believe in luck
[16:31] I don't believe me look I believe in I
[16:33] believe in faith and the Providence of
[16:35] God
[16:36] that give us a time you know gave us a
[16:39] time to do what today make our choice
[16:41] today is the day of salvation they told
[16:44] Moses Moses said choose you this day who
[16:46] you'll serve today that's why today that
[16:49] I felt in my heart to have all these
[16:52] things we we we're going to have
[16:53] communion in foot washing that's one
[16:55] ordinance word of baptism is a very
[16:57] important ordinance well I I just felt
[17:00] that maybe somebody wanted to be
[17:01] baptized we baptized 20 of them in this
[17:03] church last year and now we got five
[17:06] more so you know praise the Lord for
[17:09] that and and baptism doesn't save you
[17:11] but buddy I'll tell you what it'll do
[17:13] it'll knock the devil between eyes when
[17:16] he starts talking to you you can say
[17:17] nobody I died right there
[17:19] I went into the water and I died that
[17:22] old me died and I resurrected new to
[17:25] newness of life
[17:26] and that's what I want us to see not
[17:28] just at water water will never clean you
[17:30] there's no way you can take enough water
[17:32] you can't take that four-fifths of an
[17:34] ocean and try to clean yourself up but
[17:36] God can take the baptism of the Holy
[17:38] Ghost he can take fire and clean you up
[17:40] in a split second amen clean your life
[17:43] up amen oh no he's not done you're not
[17:45] going to forget what you did you're
[17:46] going to still remember that but you
[17:48] know what that gives why it gives you
[17:49] Grace
[17:50] to remember I was like the old black
[17:53] sister sent him not what I not what it
[17:55] was not what I want to be but I'm sure
[17:57] ain't what I used to be all right so
[18:00] we're we're changed if we're going to
[18:02] tell you everybody's worried about a
[18:04] body change and that's okay I do too
[18:05] especially as we get older you younger
[18:08] ones are okay with that but that's the
[18:10] older ones you know I was walking
[18:11] yesterday up those gravel steps and I'm
[18:13] like
[18:15] why do these people keep passing me
[18:17] they're 20 years old and they just jump
[18:19] up there you know Michael misses two
[18:21] runs of the steps and he just I used to
[18:23] do that
[18:25] not anymore
[18:26] the curses took over a little bit more
[18:28] but we're looking for a body change here
[18:30] now we're looking for an inside change
[18:33] here now today we're looking for a body
[18:36] change inside you because there's a soul
[18:38] inside of you that's way more different
[18:40] way more different than anything that
[18:43] you you can't grab this and say I want
[18:45] to make this and I want no it's inside
[18:46] of you already
[18:48] today is inside of you today is the day
[18:50] of your salvation today is the day you
[18:52] make a decision amen today is the day we
[18:54] rededicate ourselves as we renew our
[18:57] vows to our spouse let's renew our vows
[18:59] for our real spouse
[19:01] let's review our our vows to the Lord
[19:03] Jesus and tell them say look I've been a
[19:05] little bit dilatory I've been a little
[19:07] bit
[19:08] um standoffish or or pulled away and you
[19:10] know that's what happens in life we all
[19:12] do that we get mad well praise the Lord
[19:14] I'm sorry it's you my wife's sitting
[19:16] right here
[19:17] you go through battles
[19:20] don't talk to me
[19:22] no preach sister
[19:25] don't talk to me I don't don't talk to
[19:27] me right now
[19:28] leave me alone we go through all that
[19:30] right I'm sorry well pray for us we'll
[19:32] be the first one in the owner if y'all
[19:34] ain't having that kind of issue then
[19:36] lost
[19:40] oh it's already they've only been
[19:43] married three weeks so
[19:46] Lucas
[19:48] yeah Luke's a smile and his face is red
[19:50] so I know there's been some kind of
[19:51] argument going on
[19:52] about some silly something too so
[19:56] usually it's pretty silly you know same
[19:58] way with God it's usually some silly
[19:59] something that you say it's like we all
[20:01] say here you know the first thing when
[20:03] we start getting uh we get a little bit
[20:07] um cold
[20:08] what's the first thing we do instead of
[20:10] diving back into church and diving into
[20:12] the things that we do here you you dive
[20:15] away from us
[20:16] well that ain't going to help you
[20:18] that ain't separation that's why you
[20:20] don't want to do that you want to get
[20:22] closer and that's why the vowel renewal
[20:24] today I hope it brings us closer to our
[20:26] spouse but I saw also hope it takes us
[20:29] closer to the Lord Jesus all right that
[20:32] we do these ordinances and like I said
[20:34] we're human beings though but we can
[20:35] take these ordinances and say Satan
[20:38] this I'm taking communion today
[20:41] because that's my Lord he give us that
[20:45] commission before he left to do these
[20:47] things and to wash feet
[20:50] and he said if you don't wash feet you
[20:51] don't have no part with me so we got to
[20:53] have foot washing and communion and then
[20:55] water baptism
[20:57] in the Waterway
[20:59] it's the light today buried in the
[21:01] precious name of Jesus
[21:03] not in father son Holy Ghost those are
[21:05] titles amen so we know that so anyway so
[21:09] let's get started here it was four look
[21:10] at foreknowledge foreknowledge looks
[21:12] back and says that he foresaw this and
[21:15] knows that's the reason he could tell
[21:16] what the end is from the beginning we'll
[21:18] skip through that because listen what
[21:20] God saw
[21:21] God saw that he would write a word that
[21:24] would never change
[21:27] change right like I said before if he
[21:30] loved you before he's going to love you
[21:32] now because he foreknew that you would
[21:34] love him
[21:36] but he had to love you first
[21:39] then he loved us enough to follow us
[21:41] down our life before we even got here
[21:47] amen and see our imperfections and see
[21:49] the things that we're going to do and
[21:51] make a perpetuation the Bible says and
[21:53] we'll get to in a minute about this
[21:55] reconciliation he reconciled us what
[21:57] does that mean that means repair our
[22:00] relationship
[22:02] with God and with our spouse to
[22:04] reconcile us to bring it right back
[22:06] together to what it was before and
[22:08] that's what God's wanting to do like he
[22:10] did in the Garden of Eden he had perfect
[22:12] harmony with Adam and Eve and and the
[22:16] first marriage ceremony there God did it
[22:19] the father brought the bride
[22:21] handed it to the groom and sit here
[22:24] and Adam says She's Mine she's bone of
[22:27] my bone she's flesh in my flesh
[22:30] She's mine now and I can fellowship with
[22:32] her of course the old devil was there
[22:35] too and he heard all that so and he's
[22:37] here today so let's let's don't worry
[22:39] about it but let's just keep on going
[22:41] whether he's here or not
[22:42] we know that God's here
[22:44] all right so now he's talking about
[22:46] making a choice we're gonna choose you
[22:49] this day now remember we didn't have a
[22:52] choice getting here
[22:54] everybody with me we did not have a
[22:56] choice getting here there's no way you
[22:57] could
[22:58] make yourself get here
[23:01] so you had nothing to do with that that
[23:03] had to be the Providence of God but God
[23:05] for knowing what you would do when you
[23:07] got here it was really easy for him to
[23:09] put your mom and daddy together
[23:11] think how miraculous that was
[23:15] in 20 000 little humans went out
[23:19] in conception but only one
[23:22] only one one egg comes down one sperm
[23:25] comes down they connect together here
[23:26] you are and God give you a soul
[23:29] and he gave you a soul and he's going to
[23:31] let you decide what to do with it
[23:34] he didn't decide you decide what to do
[23:36] with it you have a choice
[23:39] now watch what the prophet of God said
[23:40] but if he made you thus without you
[23:43] having anything to say how much more can
[23:45] he through his brooding give you a
[23:49] choice
[23:50] and you're on the basis of free moral
[23:52] agency everybody here today is on free
[23:54] more agency you can choose
[23:56] now
[23:58] the children that are below the age of
[24:00] accountability they're covered under
[24:03] the blood of Jesus Christ but when they
[24:05] come to the age of accountability
[24:07] you're a free moral agent and God's
[24:09] going to start judging you at that
[24:10] moment all right so you can turn this
[24:13] down or you can accept it to turn it
[24:15] down is to be lost and remain potass
[24:17] calcium and petroleum but to accept it
[24:19] and have a new heart a new spirit and
[24:22] his Spirit part of the logos in you
[24:24] controlling your emotions and when he
[24:27] Coos through his word you could back an
[24:30] answer to him by saying what amen
[24:35] what
[24:38] y'all did a ball game may be a lot
[24:40] louder than that
[24:42] this ought to be your favorite team
[24:43] right here
[24:44] and so be your favorite team you ought
[24:46] to come you ought to come to this
[24:47] Stadium to watch this ball team take
[24:48] over amen
[24:49] [Applause]
[24:56] having a choice in other words you don't
[24:57] have a choice to get here but now you do
[24:59] have a choice when you get here how much
[25:01] more will he raise us from the dust of
[25:04] the earth after we've made a choice
[25:06] after we've made a choice
[25:09] and he has brewed to us and we brewed
[25:12] back to him we love him
[25:15] amen that's why that we we we love our
[25:18] spouses as much as we can
[25:21] but love feel your love is conditional
[25:26] you should love your wife or her husband
[25:28] unconditionally but you know what
[25:30] there's conditions and every once in a
[25:32] while
[25:33] he sleeps on the couch you sleep in the
[25:36] bedroom
[25:38] well some of y'all kids looking over at
[25:39] your parents for
[25:42] praise the Lord just look at kids
[25:43] they'll tell you what's going on in them
[25:46] now you got to make a choice
[25:48] that's what God put him here for Jesus
[25:51] said let every man's word be a lie mine
[25:53] be truth I wish I'd had my granddaughter
[25:54] first I wouldn't have my kids now you've
[25:57] got to make your mind as my grandbaby
[25:59] back there now you've got to make up
[26:01] your mind you got to make a choice
[26:04] and this may be your last time to make a
[26:06] choice
[26:08] tomorrow may be too late
[26:11] God might have chose you to eternal life
[26:15] but if you don't make up your mind and
[26:17] accept it somebody else will take your
[26:19] place
[26:21] wow
[26:22] that's the sovereignty of God he knew
[26:25] you wouldn't or he knew you would but
[26:28] you've got to make the choice you're you
[26:29] gotta you've got to as brother Tom falbo
[26:32] said you got to trigger your
[26:33] predestination you got to get into it
[26:35] and and say I accept you Lord and he
[26:37] said yeah I know that's what I saw
[26:39] you know I saw I saw before the
[26:41] foundation world that's why you know
[26:42] that's why I brought you here so I
[26:43] bruised it over you you know I brewed it
[26:45] over everybody but I knew you would
[26:46] accept it
[26:48] same way with all of us
[26:50] now
[26:52] we can skip through this but back part
[26:53] in the back part of God's mind somebody
[26:56] we were talking about something the
[26:57] other day that back part that you know
[26:59] you see that that's something that you
[27:01] keep your secrets in you keep all your
[27:02] things inside of your brain up in that
[27:05] area all right according to science
[27:07] but what did God do he didn't want to
[27:09] just keep it in there he wanted to
[27:10] release it he wanted to tell us what his
[27:12] mind was because man has just scrupled
[27:14] this thing up so bad so well the mind of
[27:16] God's the father son Holy Ghost baptism
[27:18] uh the mind of God is is you know we
[27:20] don't have to go to church and the mind
[27:22] of God is we don't have to that's not
[27:24] the mind of God
[27:26] the mind of God is what the Bible says
[27:28] and I just believe that and I just
[27:30] believe that by the preaching of the
[27:32] word of God that we see more of the mind
[27:33] of God we enter into the mind of God and
[27:36] then what happens with
[27:39] excuse me what happens with Adam and Eve
[27:42] when they were in the garden it was
[27:43] perfect harmony
[27:45] until sin took over we know but it was
[27:47] perfect harmony it was a perfect Eden as
[27:50] brother Smiley was preaching last week
[27:51] last weekend
[27:53] but there was a crushing blow came
[27:56] when Satan got in the picture
[27:58] Three's a Crowd
[27:59] a man faded stuck together and stayed
[28:01] together if she had stayed behind her
[28:03] mate
[28:04] this thing wouldn't happen but you know
[28:05] what God saw that he allowed that to
[28:07] happen he couldn't stop it why wouldn't
[28:09] you say well God's going to stop that no
[28:10] he couldn't
[28:12] he had attributes
[28:14] inside of him that need to be expressed
[28:16] as brothers says right here in order to
[28:18] let himself be expressed as God he's got
[28:21] to be a savior he's a Healer he's a
[28:23] redeemer and without uh
[28:26] something falling they can't redeem it
[28:27] back
[28:28] all right
[28:29] First Corinthians 6 9
[28:32] righteous shall not inherit the kingdom
[28:34] of God be not deceived neither
[28:36] fornicators idolaters
[28:39] adulterers effeminate abusers of himself
[28:43] of mankind
[28:44] thieves Covetous drunkers revilers
[28:47] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[28:49] of God
[28:50] sounds like we don't have a chance
[28:53] Paul says and such for some of you but
[28:55] you're washed Washed by what Washed by
[28:57] the Water of the word you come in and
[28:59] you listen to the word of God and you
[29:01] listen to to the to brother Brown speak
[29:03] and you listen to God speaks to you
[29:05] that's the most important thing I want
[29:07] God to speak to me it doesn't matter if
[29:09] he speaks through somebody through the
[29:11] prophet or through somebody standing up
[29:12] here but I want God to speak to me all
[29:14] right I want God to speak to me and he
[29:16] will
[29:17] all right if he spoke lip to ear to
[29:19] Moses you ought to be able to speak lift
[29:21] here to you and me
[29:23] we're his children right
[29:26] and such were some of you but you are
[29:28] washed you're Sanctified justified in
[29:30] the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit
[29:32] of our God
[29:33] second Samuel 22 says God is my strength
[29:36] and power and he maketh my way perfect
[29:41] Philippians 2 15 that you may be
[29:43] blameless and harmless
[29:45] the sons of God without rebuke
[29:48] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[29:50] Nation among whom you shine as lights in
[29:53] the world
[29:54] Genesis 17 1 says when Abram was 90 and
[29:57] 9 the Lord appeared unto Abram and said
[29:59] unto him I am the almighty God walk
[30:02] before me and be thou perfect remember
[30:04] Abram had a lot of issues
[30:07] Abram didn't do everything God told him
[30:09] to do
[30:10] but God saw Abram
[30:13] turned into Abraham
[30:15] and he gave him that name because of
[30:17] what he saw he saw Abraham come to a
[30:20] place that he said
[30:23] almost like I mean like Mary said be it
[30:25] unto me according to Thy word he come to
[30:27] a place where he Abram said hey unless
[30:29] you do something God that's the way I
[30:31] want us to be because we come to it we
[30:33] all come to that place we come to place
[30:34] like God if you don't step on the scene
[30:36] something's going to happen
[30:39] but but we want something to happen in
[30:41] our life
[30:42] hey there's not a lot of junk happens
[30:44] already we want God to step in and and
[30:48] yesterday when uh when when Lauren and
[30:51] uh
[30:52] Jill were were
[30:55] dancing
[30:58] it just makes you it just makes you see
[31:01] that
[31:02] I hate the devil
[31:05] I hate that demon of cancer I hate that
[31:07] I hate I hate that it's tearing people
[31:09] apart
[31:12] but there's a God that heals
[31:15] there's a God that will keep you he'll
[31:18] sustain you you just got to keep holding
[31:20] on
[31:21] he then endureth to the end shall be
[31:24] saved amen we'll read that maybe in just
[31:25] a minute he didn't endure it you got to
[31:28] endure some of this even as we're
[31:31] that's where he knows getting close time
[31:32] to close
[31:34] but he gave us Apostle prophets pastors
[31:37] teaching evangelist for the perfecting
[31:39] of the Saints in other words as we were
[31:41] talking about yesterday
[31:43] perfecting means completely furnished or
[31:45] equipped he he equipped Adam and he
[31:47] equipped even he equips you and me if
[31:49] we're born again but he equipped them
[31:51] with an ability to be the to be together
[31:56] all right because Adam and Eve were
[31:57] literally one person
[31:59] all right
[32:00] DNA wise they were one now you and I as
[32:03] close to our spouse as we are we can't
[32:05] be because of the Fall that's what
[32:07] separated us and we had to come from
[32:09] this mother and father over here and
[32:11] this mother and father over here and be
[32:12] joined together all right but God told
[32:15] him I'm more Jesus told him in the in
[32:17] the New Testament he said what God
[32:19] joined together
[32:20] let no man put us under and we'll talk
[32:22] about that this afternoon but to be
[32:25] perfect is to be completely furnished
[32:27] you and I have been equipped
[32:30] with what we need
[32:33] to combat the devil to combat the world
[32:36] all these things that sometimes we feel
[32:38] like it beat us down God promised to
[32:41] give us the equipment and he did
[32:44] he gave us the Holy Ghost number one to
[32:47] give us guidance
[32:49] then he gave us the word of God that
[32:51] everything
[32:52] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[32:55] what a powerful little bitty sentence
[32:57] don't you don't have to do anything you
[32:59] have to crawl up a wall or do Penance or
[33:02] or you know you know go through a bed of
[33:05] nails resist him
[33:08] say get out of here
[33:10] leave us alone yeah
[33:14] yeah but we got to have patience
[33:16] patience with God to do what he said
[33:18] he'd do and then patience with each
[33:20] other all right so why not get to it but
[33:22] let's let's talk about reconciliation
[33:24] just for a minute because he gave us a
[33:26] word of reconciliation to reconcile us
[33:28] back and that's what's happening now
[33:30] then he gave us a message of
[33:32] reconciliation this message that the
[33:34] prophet brought us in the end time is to
[33:36] reconcile us back to the faith of the
[33:39] fathers that was in Jude that was once
[33:42] delivered to the Saints which is this
[33:44] statue of a perfect man or II Peter 1
[33:47] add to your faith virtues it's an adding
[33:50] we're adding these things to us and I
[33:52] believe some of us some of us have done
[33:54] that we've added to our faith but you've
[33:57] got to know what that virtue is you got
[33:58] to know what that knowledge is that's
[34:00] not have anything to do with the world
[34:03] you'd be the smartest man in the world
[34:04] you know Einstein was the smartest man
[34:06] in the world but if he wasn't born again
[34:07] you know where he's going to end up
[34:11] not in heaven
[34:13] smartest man in the world richest man in
[34:15] the world bezo or whoever whoever it is
[34:18] now is the richest man in the world
[34:20] that's not going to buy him salvation
[34:24] I love the the the the the the uh when
[34:28] Jesus comes and tells the parable and
[34:30] tells them says Hey Lazarus the beggar
[34:32] made it
[34:35] Rich Young Ruler didn't yeah
[34:38] he was in hell trying to buy some water
[34:40] with his riches remember he said come
[34:43] and bring and Lazarus is just laying
[34:45] over there the Bible says in the bosom
[34:47] of Abraham and he's just having a good
[34:49] time
[34:50] amen
[34:51] let's be like a beggar
[34:56] brother Brown said I've tried to have
[34:58] patience 33 years patience women still
[35:00] Bob their hair just the same
[35:02] but have patience just have patience if
[35:04] you ain't got it don't try to build on
[35:06] it see it's not just it's not just
[35:08] having worldly patients you have to have
[35:09] patience that goes beyond what somebody
[35:12] says well just be patient no you gotta
[35:14] really be patient
[35:17] I mean real patients like like and I
[35:19] don't know Regina doesn't mind but
[35:20] Regina's sitting there going well I want
[35:23] Kendrick to be sitting here beside me
[35:24] and I want him to be you know with his
[35:26] wife and and grandbaby and I want him to
[35:28] be praising the Lord have patience
[35:32] I was talking was talking this morning
[35:34] Jim and I were talking there there's a
[35:35] slot in time that we got to come to
[35:37] brother they'll preached on matching
[35:38] pieces years and years ago there's a
[35:40] slot of time we got to come to that God
[35:42] saw us come to that time and before that
[35:45] it's like brother Brown said there's
[35:47] scrap heaps of ministers and Christians
[35:49] that are that are laying on the side of
[35:51] the road that tried to make something
[35:52] happen
[35:53] all right now listen though there's a
[35:55] fine line and we'll close right here
[35:57] there's a fine line between laying back
[35:59] and letting something happen and making
[36:01] something happen we don't want to be
[36:03] lazy like I said before if you need a
[36:05] job
[36:06] we'll pray for you get a job but I
[36:09] promise you one thing Jesus is not going
[36:11] to come to your house while you're
[36:12] sitting on the couch playing your video
[36:13] games
[36:14] hello somebody
[36:16] and he's gonna go hey I got you a job
[36:20] no
[36:22] no you're gonna go out and you're going
[36:23] to strive and you're gonna put your best
[36:25] forward and you're gonna say God help me
[36:28] say have you ever done that
[36:31] say the right thing so that that man
[36:33] will give me a job or that woman amen
[36:37] say Lord
[36:41] tells us that if we go before
[36:42] magistrates and judges and not the
[36:45] scripture says don't rehearse your
[36:49] speech
[36:53] that's why sometimes it's best that we
[36:55] don't rehearse our sermons really
[37:00] because you want God to speak anyway
[37:02] because listen and when he speaks he is
[37:05] exactly 100 correct
[37:09] 100 perfect 100 on spot yeah and you
[37:15] know what if you don't get that job
[37:16] guess what
[37:17] God's knows are the best yeses you'll
[37:20] ever get
[37:21] sometimes but you know what
[37:24] um
[37:24] Michael you know especially being a
[37:26] young man
[37:27] and I was too you think man if I can get
[37:30] this job
[37:32] all right everybody with me just for a
[37:34] man and we'll then we'll close everybody
[37:35] let's stand our feet come on but I get I
[37:39] I know
[37:41] this is it
[37:43] I feel it
[37:45] because it's more money
[37:49] well that ain't what you got to put
[37:50] first
[37:52] you're you're wrong already seek ye
[37:54] first the kingdom of God
[37:57] Lord will that job impact
[38:01] am I going to church
[38:03] my worshiping
[38:05] will that job impede me from doing the
[38:08] things I need to do for you first
[38:11] because we've seen many times that we've
[38:12] as brother Brown says we've been train
[38:14] wrecks
[38:16] scrap heaps of ministers and us on the
[38:19] side of the road but you know what you
[38:21] got to do
[38:22] get up off your can
[38:25] and start over
[38:27] life lesson I'm sorry
[38:29] 175 I guess
[38:32] but these these virtues are to help you
[38:34] be a better Christian though
[38:36] but you can be a good person out in the
[38:37] world and die and go to hell
[38:40] you can be a good person and go to
[38:41] church and die and go to hell but you
[38:43] can't have the new birth you can't be
[38:45] born again by the spirit of God and have
[38:48] his soul inside of your soul and go to
[38:50] hell you can't that can't happen ain't
[38:53] gonna happen devil they listen
[38:56] there can be seven billion Devils just
[38:59] like that
[39:01] Satan himself if you get born again
[39:04] can't touch you can't touch your soul
[39:08] so guess what let's get that let's get
[39:11] that settled
[39:13] get God in your soul not just not just a
[39:15] good feeling or I'm in the message and
[39:17] I'm gonna go you know sit in the church
[39:19] and no I want to get born again so that
[39:22] God can speak to me and then what use me
[39:24] yes use me to do something for somebody
[39:27] else amen I I don't want to do this job
[39:30] for me
[39:32] I do it for you all ministers do that
[39:35] all ministers are ministers that
[39:37] Minister their what their aid to you not
[39:40] to their self but their aid to you and
[39:43] that's the way God uses us so uh we love
[39:45] you with the love of the Lord
[39:47] um we're we're good we're on time what
[39:49] we'll do is after we take communion
[39:51] before we go downstairs we'll let sister
[39:53] Beverly come up and give her a testimony
[39:54] if that's okay just for a few minutes
[39:56] and then we'll go downstairs and do our
[39:57] foot washing and then after that we'll
[40:00] just be dismissed
[40:01] eat your lunch whatever you need to do
[40:03] and then we'll come back here at two
[40:04] o'clock is everybody with me just when
[40:06] you get finished going down we'll let
[40:08] her give her testimony sisters going
[40:10] downstairs wash feet We'll Wash feet
[40:12] here we'll close the service out and
[40:14] then we'll just flow right into the to
[40:16] having lunch or whatever you're going to
[40:18] do and then we'll get ready at two
[40:20] o'clock we'll come back have singing
[40:22] we'll have I'll I'll exhort just a
[40:24] little bit on vows and and water baptism
[40:26] and stuff and then we'll have that
[40:28] service starting at maybe 2 30 or so if
[40:31] everybody's okay with that and like I
[40:34] said if you need them if you need a
[40:35] flower arrangement or or a bouquet uh
[40:38] Jim's got some beautiful ones down there
[40:40] so let's read First Corinthians now this
[40:42] is an open uh communion anybody we don't
[40:45] refuse communion for anyone
[40:47] because it's up to you to know whether
[40:49] you're eligible or not we don't make you
[40:53] eligible you do all right
[40:55] for I have received the Lord this is
[40:56] First Corinthians I think he's got it up
[40:58] there for I've received of the Lord that
[41:00] which also I delivered unto you that the
[41:02] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[41:03] was afraid took bread
[41:05] and when he had given thanks and said
[41:07] take eat this is body which is broken
[41:09] for you
[41:10] do and remember me after the same manner
[41:14] also he took the cup and when he had
[41:15] saved this cup
[41:17] is the New Testament
[41:19] there had to be a testator to die
[41:22] to make a new testament
[41:24] but it's not just a new testament that's
[41:26] written by bulls and goats and Lambs it
[41:29] was a new testament in God's blood
[41:33] his own blood the life that was in that
[41:35] blood is going to come back on the
[41:37] believer and that's what I was talking
[41:38] about today that's what makes you
[41:40] perfect you can't make yourself perfect
[41:42] right all right
[41:44] you'll go crazy trying to make yourself
[41:46] perfect but let God let go just get in
[41:48] the Bible just read your scripture just
[41:50] just listen just listen to the the
[41:52] ministry that that speaks to you that'll
[41:55] make you perfect
[41:56] establish settle scriptures what
[41:58] scripture says
[41:59] do this as often as you drinking and
[42:01] remembers of me for as often as you eat
[42:03] this bread and drink this cup you do
[42:05] show the Lord's death till he comes
[42:06] that's an ordinance that we do every
[42:08] month we we get ourselves clean and we
[42:10] get ready to take communion and we do
[42:13] that once a month and that's that's our
[42:15] church at every Church Sovereign they
[42:16] can do what they want to but we do it
[42:17] every month
[42:18] for as often as you eat this bread and
[42:20] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[42:21] death till he come
[42:23] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[42:25] and drink this cup of the Lord
[42:26] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[42:29] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[42:30] examine himself
[42:33] that's what we want to do everybody
[42:34] examine their self don't examine well
[42:37] now if if Brooklyn will get right I'll
[42:39] say no you get right
[42:42] let's only worry about him you worry
[42:44] about yourself don't worry about
[42:45] somebody else and don't be looking
[42:47] around
[42:48] well I wonder why they ain't taking
[42:49] communion
[42:51] maybe because of you
[42:53] well anyhow
[42:55] but let a man examine himself and so
[42:58] letting me to that bread and drinking
[42:59] that cup for eatest and drinketh
[43:01] unworldly eat us and drink a damnation
[43:03] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[43:05] body
[43:06] what is the Lord's body it's us all
[43:09] right that's what I just said don't
[43:10] worry about somebody else you got your
[43:11] own you got your own Holy Ghost all
[43:14] right or not so you deal with that
[43:17] for this cause many or we can sickly
[43:19] among you many sleeps see if you miss
[43:20] you see what happens all right for if we
[43:24] would judge ourselves we should not be
[43:27] judged
[43:28] I want to
[43:29] preach on that maybe one day but not
[43:31] today don't have time but when we are
[43:33] judged
[43:34] all right well we judge by the word not
[43:36] by the not by an individual we're judged
[43:38] by the word of God all right but when we
[43:40] are we look in the word of God we are
[43:42] chastened by the word of God chasing of
[43:45] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[43:47] with the world in other words we won't
[43:49] be judged like the world's being judged
[43:51] but we will be judged as we come here to
[43:54] church and Christian wherefore my
[43:56] brother when you come together to eat
[43:58] Terry one for another If any man hunger
[44:00] let him eat at home
[44:02] that you come not together into
[44:03] condemnation the rest will I said in
[44:06] order when I come we don't want
[44:07] condemnation we want reconciliation
[44:10] all right we want to reconcile
[44:11] everything today we want to reconcile
[44:13] bring everything back to zero re-up
[44:16] start over do whatever you want whatever
[44:18] you want to do today should be the day
[44:20] that you have a chance to do that so
[44:22] just for a moment
[44:24] let's have a silent word of Prayer
[44:27] uh praying for uh brother Ryan said pray
[44:29] for your pastor pray for your church and
[44:31] then pray that we
[44:33] get our hearts right
[44:34] spell
[44:43] help us Lord Jesus name we pray amen
[44:47] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[44:49] it dear heavenly father Lord this bread
[44:50] was made with holy hands
[44:52] it was made the correct way Lord
[44:55] we'll take it tonight and destroy it
[44:58] won't hold it over because there'll be
[45:00] new word tomorrow just as there was new
[45:02] Manna in the wilderness
[45:04] father we pray now though that this will
[45:06] go into our body and Lord we'll Remember
[45:09] You Lord how they laid the stripes on
[45:12] your back
[45:13] they tore into your flesh with those
[45:15] canine tails and they drove Nails in
[45:17] your hands and Marge your your wonderful
[45:20] body but Lord you did that so that we
[45:23] wouldn't have one that our body would
[45:25] not be marred Lord when we'd get it take
[45:27] a change and go over in the Rapture
[45:28] father
[45:29] we'll have a glorious body like you Lord
[45:31] I Thank you for this I ask you the bless
[45:34] in Jesus name amen
[45:45] could you imagine you know I mean some
[45:47] people I'm sure they were Rebels and
[45:50] uh in the camp because they weren't they
[45:52] were a mixed multitude
[45:54] and God instructed the Israelites said
[45:56] look I'm gonna rain this food down from
[45:58] heaven all right every day every morning
[46:00] you pick it up and on and on Friday you
[46:03] need to pick up twice I'm gonna send you
[46:05] double
[46:07] look how gracious the Lord was he didn't
[46:08] make him do without he give him double
[46:10] but he said don't you pick it up
[46:13] on Saturday which is their Sabbath all
[46:16] right don't pick it up
[46:17] because if you do
[46:19] you gonna die and there'll be wiggle
[46:20] Tails then if you hold it over no don't
[46:22] put it in the fridge
[46:24] don't eat plant in the freezer
[46:26] it ain't gonna do you any good
[46:28] because the word of God is fresh every
[46:30] day you get new revelation every single
[46:33] day
[46:36] and I was reading I believe it was
[46:38] yesterday I think or maybe a little bit
[46:39] before that where brother Brown said we
[46:41] live in other words we live and thrive
[46:43] on Revelation that's not an exact quote
[46:45] but it's close enough I know we do
[46:47] because when I get a revelation I live
[46:48] on it
[46:50] um man should not live by bread alone
[46:52] but by what every Revelation that
[46:54] proceedeth out of the mouth of God the
[46:56] heavenly father thank you for this wine
[46:59] it's been prepared Lord and it gets
[47:00] better and better with AIDS father just
[47:02] as the word of God and the Holy Ghost
[47:04] stimulates us every day father I pray
[47:06] this should bless it Lord and sanctify
[47:08] it to our people in Jesus name amen
[47:11] Come Morning how long
[47:15] by the river
[47:19] I'll rest Neath thee ever green tree
[47:26] I'll carry
[47:28] my cross
[47:31] through the midnight
[47:34] come morning
[47:36] there's Glory
[47:39] for me
[47:42] sometimes I'm the whole world gets a
[47:44] hold of us
[47:45] and reject him but not by God
[47:49] and I question old father
[47:53] how long
[47:57] then I take one more low
[48:01] at Mount Calvary never forget what
[48:04] Calvary did for us and it gives me the
[48:08] strength too
[48:10] go on
[48:12] come morning
[48:14] I want that's one of the most peaceful
[48:17] songs
[48:18] because it's a reality to us brother
[48:20] John there's one day when we're going to
[48:22] cross over we're going to sit in green
[48:24] grass that's the softest grass you've
[48:26] ever set on in your life
[48:28] and you're not gonna have to get up and
[48:29] be in a hurry to go do this and that and
[48:31] the other
[48:32] you can just sit there
[48:34] and enjoy the breeze
[48:39] no trials
[48:41] no tribulations
[48:43] we know we got to go through a little
[48:44] bit of it here
[48:47] because it tests us
[48:48] test our patients
[48:52] godliness the Bible says we'll get to
[48:54] sometime maybe next Sunday regardless
[48:56] with contentment
[48:58] that's what that song is to me well
[49:00] every time I sing that song it just
[49:01] brings a piece
[49:03] come morning
[49:04] I'll walk by a river
[49:07] I'll rest
[49:09] the evergreen tree
[49:11] but I'll carry my cross here
[49:14] but come morning
[49:16] there's glory for me

[52:00] Sometimes some testimonies kinda I'm
[52:03] Shame about but I have to tell the truth
[52:04] regardless of what
[52:07] man no my husband he was drinking a lot
[52:09] I'm doing things out there
[52:12] in the 2000s 20s those areas so we moved
[52:16] from we wasn't living in Atlanta then
[52:18] so
[52:19] he got a cat from here and we moved to
[52:21] Baltimore 2003.
[52:23] right so he decided to get detox he went
[52:27] to hospital and they
[52:29] he won something right sent him to a
[52:33] rehab about two hours away and he bought
[52:36] his cat here and he loved his cat very
[52:37] much
[52:38] and that time he left the cat back with
[52:41] me and my family
[52:43] to take good care of and my daughter you
[52:45] know she took the castle all right and
[52:48] when she got to the store she took the
[52:50] cat out and he jumped and disappeared
[52:52] so I had to tell my husband now look the
[52:56] cat is missing and he was very upset
[52:59] so anyway a few months weeks later it
[53:02] was time for him to graduate
[53:03] and the family sent out later for me to
[53:06] come
[53:07] to the graduation so when I went there
[53:09] now before I went he told me to look
[53:12] really nice so I decided to say well
[53:14] okay I'm gonna get my ear fixed in my
[53:16] mind I went and put dye in my ear jet

[58:38] supper being ended the devil haven't put
[58:40] in the heart of Judas this carrot
[58:42] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[58:44] that the father had given all things
[58:46] into his hand and that he was come from
[58:47] God and he went to God he rises from
[58:49] supper and lay decide His Garment and
[58:51] took a towel and girded himself after
[58:53] that he pours water into a basin and
[58:55] began to wash the disciples feet
[58:57] and to wipe him with the towel with it
[58:59] was girded I'm sure they probably had
[59:02] never seen that before they're seeing
[59:04] somebody they called the master they
[59:06] called they called him the one you know
[59:08] the chosen one he's the Messiah
[59:10] he's pouring water in a bucket and
[59:13] getting ready to wash their feet I'm
[59:15] sure they had a little bit of a
[59:16] reservation I'm sure we know Peter did
[59:19] but I'm sure the rest of them were
[59:21] thinking that Peter was just one like me
[59:22] he just want to say that because if
[59:24] they're all were like hey wait a minute
[59:25] and Jesus kind of calmed down he said
[59:27] look he said watch
[59:29] said after the 94th water in a basin and
[59:32] he was going to wipe their
[59:34] wash their feet wipe them with a towel
[59:36] with he was girded then cometh he to
[59:38] Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord
[59:39] does thou wash my feet
[59:41] Jesus answered and said what I do thou
[59:43] knowest not now he knew they didn't he
[59:45] knew he deserved everything that was
[59:47] going on in that room
[59:49] but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said
[59:51] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[59:53] Jesus said if I wash thee not thou has
[59:56] no part with me
[59:57] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[59:59] feet only but also my hands in my head
[1:00:01] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:00:03] neither not saved to wash his feet but
[1:00:05] it's clean every whipped and you're
[1:00:07] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:00:10] betray him therefore he said you're not
[1:00:12] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:00:14] feet he had taken His Garment would sit
[1:00:16] down he said unto them know you what
[1:00:18] I've done to you ask them a question you
[1:00:21] call me master and Lord and you say well
[1:00:22] for so I am
[1:00:24] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:00:25] washed your feet you ought also to wash
[1:00:27] one another's feet for I have given you
[1:00:30] an example that you should do as I have
[1:00:31] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[1:00:34] the servant is not greater than his Lord
