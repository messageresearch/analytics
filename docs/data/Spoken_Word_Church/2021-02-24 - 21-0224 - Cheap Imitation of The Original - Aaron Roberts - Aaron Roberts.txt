the bible tells me so many souls have been his prayer to fall in somewhere but god is promised us today is overcoming power amen greater is he that is in me greater is he that isn't me greater is he

pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy [Music] holy [Music] amen god bless you tonight good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen if you ever bibles we're going to look in genesis chapter one then we'll go to isaiah chapter 14. so y'all just pray for me tonight and i uh got a phone call earlier from brother richie douglas and he had they was waiting they had just sent his mom in the in the ambulance when he called me and they wanted the church to pray for his mom she fell when i said she fell yesterday and then she fell again today and they think she might have messed up her shoulder they're not sure but they didn't want him to move or anybody to move her until the ambulance got there to take her so he called me and kind of shook up so he said tell brother dale in the church to pray so so you know a lot of us call her mama douglas and sister christine and incredible woman of faith and you know y'all y'all for brother ritchie's testimony about you know that was his aunt and uncle that is mom and dad and you know he was born without an ankle bone she carried him in every prayer line that she could and they didn't really have any hope or any idea what to do for him but she had a x-ray of that foot and it didn't have an ankle bone and then one day they had an x-ray and it did have an ankle ball [Applause] so he walks he walks with a limp but he's a big old fella but you know what he's walking on faith truly that's a that's a miracle right there and you know all the things that you know if you ever if you're ever around her any any length of time she's got a book and everything that she's prayed for and god's delivered she was looking for some furniture for her up for she you know she has a trailer and she was looking for some furniture and she kind of told the lord what she was wanting well you know what she found it and she's got pictures of it she's got it all in her photo album she was sitting down one day and she was showing me all these pictures things that god had done that she had prayed about and she had the evidence there so you know she's a incredible lady of faith and we love her and thank a lot of her you know she used to call me every time she'd see me and she'd always call me dale i look so much like daddy and she'd get confused and she'd be talking to me and she called me dale so brother richie still calls me that sometimes just picking on me you know so i'll just pray for them and then um i'm not even sure who they are it's it's some people there in in jefferson and uh this man i don't know who he is he just posted on facebook today that his wife's been on the ventilator with coven since last month that she's not gotten any better and he was telling he was asking for prayer from everybody so you know there's lots of people that are out there and you know if somebody was was to sit down and take the time to write that that's just not something just to gloss over or look at but you know it really touched my heart i don't know who the people are but you know we know that's the god knows who they are and i know there's many other ones as brother terence mentioned this evening we know there's many that have a need and god's mindful of all of them but you know sometimes he lays it on our heart do the praying to do the interceding for them so as we look tonight in in genesis chapter one let's just all bow our heads and we'll just speak to the author before we get started this afternoon our dear heavenly father we thank you for this day lord we thank you for all that you've done for us lord we're just so thankful lord that we can come in your house lord and gather in your name lord you said where are the two or three are gathered i'm there in the midst we know that you're here with us and lord we just pray tonight you just help us tonight lord everything is said and be for your honor and glory lord lord you speak to your people tonight lord speak to me tonight lord help us lord as we go through this journey lord lord we're just so thankful lord that we can be covered by your blood lord for our failures and our faults lord but there's a great chasm lord lord there's a sea of forgetfulness that it can go into lord and lord just help us tonight lord and lord for each one has a need lord that's one that was this man was asking about his wife there on facebook lord lord i don't know who they are lord but you know the situation lord for that man to reach out maybe he posted that lord that he realized that we would see that message and pray for him lord for mama douglas lord there brother richie and sister regina i pray that you just be with them lord touch her body lord we've seen all the miracles you've done in our life but i pray that you'll be a comfort to brother rich and sister regina tonight lord jesus we know that you take care of all things and father we just pray for each one that's not here with us tonight in this building lord the ones that are watching by the way of the internet tonight lord so many times we seem to forget that they're there but lord i pray that you just be with them tonight lord you're bright around the world there's so many that are needy lord and father they need a touch from you lord we just pray for them lord bless the ministers as they labor in all the things that that you'd have them to do or we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen genesis chapter 1 we'll begin at verse 11 and i'm trying not to make a mess genesis chapter 1 verse 11 said and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was sow and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good now we'll go to isaiah 14. let's go let's look a little odd but 14 isaiah 14 12 says how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which doubt which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that thus man that made the earth to tremble that did shaken kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners amen god bless you night you may be seated from the message the spoken word is the original seed brother branham reads this scripture and he starts in genesis chapter one and so he says now god's word is eternal god being infinite cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else to a better decision because every decision of god is perfect he cannot once his word is once spoken it can never die it lives on and on and on and can never die because it is god his word can no more die than he can die that's the reason we read in first john or saint john first chapter he said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh the same word that was spoken in the beginning with his eternal purpose came on over and was made flesh and dwelt among us god's word so i want to speak a little thought today and y'all may find it a little odd but it's i entitled this the cheap imitation of the original and uh i happened to see that somewhere i was reading and i run across that and it said talking about a cheap imitation of the original and i thought you know that's a that's a pretty good title and so i'll just i had i wrote something thought about some things but you know brother brown was talking about god's word and you know god's word never changes it's the same it's you know god's god's will is god's word and whatever whatever he thought and that he spoke and you know it's not ever going to change everything else may change but god's word can't change god can't change his word and he can't die like he said and you know there in in the in the scripture brother brad says in the message the resurrection of lazarus he's he's speaking about the day of pentecost and you know he's talking about them going to the upper room and and tarrying and you know he said you wait until you're in dude with power from on high well he didn't tell him how long they were going to wait he just told them until he said you stay there and that was that was the promise that was made he said you stay there and that's what he wanted them to do and you know you know in other places where he talks about you know people they were there it's like well we think we've got it we think we've got he's like no you know peter was like no we'll know when we receive it he said because you're going to receive it'll be it'll be an experience you know brother brown said one time in questions and answers somebody asked him he said does our children need to have an experience and and he said you know or them uh realizing the message them accepting the message is that the same and he said no you need to have an experience not just accepting the message not just knowing the message not receiving the message that's not the same thing as having an experience but you know he was talking about you know they received the word that jesus spoke to the disciples received that word and they went to the upper room but that still wasn't what still wasn't the experience that jesus told them to have that was not the undoing of the power and so they had to wait on that and you know when they were when they received that power then then they they staggered around like drunk people you know they they acted weird and everybody was like you know these people are full of new wine you know they didn't understand what was going on but you know he said peter being a soapbox preacher stood up and said this these people aren't drunk like you think they are he said they're not drunk as you suppose seeing that's just the third hour of the day but he said this is that that was spoken of by the prophet joel and he said you know he said peter was being a soapbox preacher and he got up and he began to speak to him he said he preached brethren said he said preach such a sermon till he shook the stalagtites of hell down into the devil's eyes that's right he said they seen all this he said this was what was prophesied to be and they said what can we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he said what is it he said it's the same promise the same manner that fell on them to give them eternal life like the manna that carried the children of israel through the wilderness the same baptism of the holy ghost carries the church through to glory and every man as the priest was then the middle wall partitions torn down every man that'll come to god and believe that he is and a rewarder of those who seek him and give up their sins and throw their arms open to god can have not something that looks like some imitation of it but a genuine heart full of the real baptism of the holy ghost like fell on the day of pentecost make the same signs wonders and everything else take place hallelujah you know that's right may you act the same make you act the same way like a drunk man carry on just like they did on the day of pentecost every believer has a right to receive it just like every priest coming into the priesthood could get the manna hallelujah my wish i was twice my size i'd make twice as much noise maybe and i know how that i know how that is sometimes you know you get into it and you do wish she was a little bit bigger taller louder but the same but it was the same thing it was the same promise the promise didn't change god god never you know because god made the promise to everybody he didn't take the promise away from anybody the problem is is people don't accept the promise they don't accept it it wasn't that god made it and allowed people to receive it the problem is is whether you receive it or not you know there's sometimes people get confused on on the thought you know when when god spoke to cain when god spoke to cain and told him that that you know he he saw he saw cain's sacrifice and he rejected it but he told cain he gave cain the way to to follow he gave him the way to to righteousness the rule he said he said if you will do as your as your brother you know he didn't even have to have faith to believe in that he just had he just had to act on what god told him to do what he saw abel do abel had a revelation that it was blood and he offered sacrifice cain didn't have that but god told him didn't even have to have revelation that it was the blood but all he had to do was he had to have obedience and if he could have had obedience he would have been accepted and you know the thing is is people say and if you don't see it that way and i am you know because if you don't see that it was god made a way then you know what if if god did not would not accept cain if cain had offered the blood had offered a blood sacrifice if god hadn't accepted cain then god's a liar because he would have been a liar if he hadn't done it but you know the thing is it wasn't what god said is what cain done god made the way for him but cain didn't accept it gang didn't follow through with it as many times as as you know brother brown talked about how many times has he talked about we seen you know he knew what people was going to do because he he had before knowledge he knew what was going to take place he knew other people would accept it or not but you know he could have waited a million years a billion years and people still wouldn't have believed it they still wouldn't accepted it because he knew what was going to take place but you know what it wasn't that he did not make a way for them so that when one day when it comes to the great throne when do i have to stand before god and give an answer you know what it ain't going to be that they're pointing their finger at god and saying you've done me different you treated me wrong no the thing is is it's going to ring in their ears it's going to run through their mind exactly what god done for them well god spoke to them where god crossed their path and they turned him down god's not a respecter of persons he's made a way for everybody the scripture tells us that he said he said that god was not willing that any should perish he said but that all might come to repentance well if he did not make a way because john 3 says that he so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son he said to whosoever and brother branham said he said it doesn't it doesn't put anybody's name in there he said the scripture doesn't say ormond neville or william branham or anything like that but he said whosoever will he said if you you will believe what he said it's whosoever that it's to you but you've got to believe it's to you he didn't take it away from anybody see that's what that's what makes it makes it so great is because he's he spread it out to everybody and it's up to you whether you accept it or not it's up to me whether i accept it god's made a way god's made a provision he's taking care of all things all the way through as as we'll look here maybe later brother i'm talking about understanding our journey and what god's done for us and he's made a way he knew what was going to take place even before we did he knew what was what was coming our way but he's made a way sure people don't see that you know because many times as you know it it's as close as as satan said he said i'm going to be like the most high he said i'm going to exalt myself you know you know he said that he said it would be so close in the end time he said it would disease deceive the very elective possible but you know the same one that offered it you know if if if he made a way if he offered shed his blood and made a way back tore down that middle wall of partition there if he's made if he's gapped at the cab the great chasm then you know that if if he's made a way then you know what you cannot be deceived if he's if he's made a way sure the satan's going to attack that's his job that's his goal but you know what as we sang that song earlier greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world you know you might get confused you might you might lose your way but you know what if you're one of his you're not going to be you're not going to be lost he's not going to lose a single one of you many times we don't follow the way we ought to go but that don't mean he's not there this is from the message the oddball brother branham says he says i can imagine the very first church what they were and compare it with his reproduction today and compare it with this reproduction today he said this would be a cheap production of what the real church was that rugged believers in god with the holy ghost you babied not them you didn't have to pat them and tell them you'd take them in this one and be tired of that one good they go to another one you'll make them a deacon if they'll come here leave this over there he said that's a hybrid reproduction and this is this is where i where i got my where i got my thought from red ram says i was thinking of michelangelo's original painting i believe of the last supper i think he painted it do you realize what that original picture would cost you it would be countless thousands the dollars would never touch that original because it's beyond price it's so valued so high but you can buy a cheap reproduction of it for about two dollars that's why people today can't understand the ruggedness of real genuine believers they become a nut you know the world gets in such a rut till every once in a while you have to have a nut to straighten it out take somebody come on the scene that's a little different and he is a nut to that generation i was thinking about that the other day who was able who today is an is not a nut you're somebody's nut i believe the world is completely going insane you know it's a time that people can't judge between right wrong or truth or error that's where i got you know i was reading about where i saw that and it said a cheap imitation of the original but you know brother brown was speaking in the uh in the oddball and he was talking about he said you can get you can get a cheap reproduction of something and you know you know because the he said he said it was a hybrid reproduction and you know when we look at something because if you look at what the way god does things and the way man does things you know because there's there's a slight variation because you know you can you can reproduce something and people and people make and they call them replicas but you know what it never has the value that the original has you could you can make and and you know people you know you know there's there's different terminologies that we can talk about you know counterfeit is something that we make but you try to pass that off as the original you try to pass that off but a replica you know that's a replica you know what you've got but a replica is something that usually when you look at the word replica it's something that they use and they take very high in products and they try to make it really nice and it's not just some cheap made thing but it's a replica because it is supposed to um stand in for the the original so it's supposed to be a replica so that when you look at it it's not uh you know many times when they talk about making jewelry you know because they have original jewelry that's you know worth millions of dollars well they don't want they don't want those being out too far and you know where people can steal them and everything like that so they use uh they have people that they can make very what you know like costume jewelry and they can and they and it's worth lots of money and they are very well talented at their jobs and they they can do a lot of things to make it rep to replicate the original but it's still not the original right and they can have many of the the very small fine details that are in the original but it's still not the original and it's worth a lot of money but you know you can have something and many many times when they talk about making a reproduction of something well many times when you make a reproduction of something you know sometimes a reproduction is something that kind of looks psychic right but you know you can you when you start to look at it you look at the details it doesn't have the same details as the original does not like in a replica sometimes when they make replicas replicas you know they have they they even look if when they look at a a piece of furniture or anything like that they actually know the grain the details of the grain that they match those things up or they they they see the slightest little um in paintings where they where they where they add just a little touch of of paint where it swoops out this way or or this way or they have a certain line you know they try to match that identical when a reproduction it may not have that the colors may match but it doesn't have those same fine details but you know it's still not the original and all that that you do you know it so it's it's not that you know when you when you talk about making a a reproduction well when god makes a reaper when god reproduces his self when he when he takes his life and he and he adds it to someone else and he gives somebody else his life when he reproduces himself you know what there isn't any difference so there isn't you know as as so when we look at these things when we talk about reproductions yeah when there's a hybrid why because there there is a difference between what man reproduces because you know what it's not god it's not man's job to reproduce what god it's god doing his reproducing so it's god doing that not man trying to reproduce it you know because man cannot do what god done because he is the original so you can't you can't take what he's done and reproduce it and you may and you may make a fine uh fine reproduction reproduction of it a fine replica of it but it'll never be the same is from the message the mighty god unveiled he said could you compare chris christianity with christianity today with what it is then could you imagine this group that what we call christians today around across the world being like those was after pentecost babied and padded and from one church to another and say something you don't like get up and walk out could you imagine that no what is the matter it's a reproduction michelangelo that created the monument of moses you could get a reproduction of that very cheap but the original the one who painted the lord's supper i guess the original painting would run into millions of dollars if you could even buy it i don't even know where it's at but you can buy a cheap reproduction of it for about a dollar 98 cents and he said and that's the way it is today a cheap christian a reproduction just a church joiner you can buy them out for a cigarette or for a common drink or for a woman with cut hair or painted lips you can buy her for anything in the fashions of the world he said but you can't touch that genuine i see him in phil in full view the same yesterday today and forever oh christian don't you want to be a real christian if there you know he says raise your hand if you want to be one not just to be not just to be a reproduction not not something made over but you want to be a real genuine christian why because you want him to make you not not just be uh try to try to live a life try to reproduce that life but that's not what it is but it's to live the life but it's no longer as paul said it's no longer i that lives now he said but it's christ that lives in me it's him living the life not me trying to live in the la trying to live the life from the message believe us thou this brother brahman says he said that's what's the matter with the world today man people stuck up and starchy god will have to pour out the holy ghost and wilt that thing down in you everyone of us we're just exactly on the same level god made us all out of one pattern no matter if you live in a better neighborhood go to a better church there's nothing but what has god what god has made you what has god's made you and you and who are you to glory glory comes to god and brother brown was speaking here in his message he was speaking about being in the uh the coliseum there or the museum i believe was and he was talking about them uh looking at what a human body was worth when you broke it down into all the elements and what it was worth and those men were standing there and they were looking at it and you know and then the man's the one fella it says them couple of boys standing there in one look said well john we're not worth very much are we because when they seen it i think he was like 84 cents or whatever whatever it was that that brother and said and he said he said look fella he said that's your body but he said you got a soul that's worth ten thousand you scroll up let me see them i think you can scroll up some more leave us all this well i think we missed it it's 45 scroll ups let's see there it is he said that's your body but you got a soul that's worth ten thousand worlds that's right he said that body will go back to the dust some of these days but you got a soul that will live forever take care of that he said look at the value that jesus christ put on it to come from glory to die to redeem you that's the trouble we look at the outside and take care of the outside but the inside we let it go yes sir and then he goes on talking about mary and martha and the different ones but you know do we see the vague that that soul being worth ten thousand worlds sin seeing the value that god placed on it not just not just on the flesh you know brother i said many times people would take you know put a hundred dollar dress on 84 cents or you know walk around with their nose up in the air said if it you know if it rained they'd drown but you know here they are they they missed to see what what was the real value was it that god saw your soul and you know god god came to died to redeem you and you know he and as i said he made a way for everybody he's he's opened that up for everybody nobody but see the thing is is you've got to accept that it's it's not god going to force you god god's not going to override your free moral agency it's up to you whether you're going to accept it or not because you you have to make that decision god's not going to make that decision for you brother brown was speaking you know there's many that that have come and you know they had a god made a wife but the question is is are they going to accept what god give to him he was speaking of fanny crosby one time and he was speaking of of her and you know she had she had the ability to make a lot of money you know you know brother ram talks about her having you know she could have made a lot of money but you know she decided you know they wanted her to write songs because she was she had such a talent she could have made lots of money and you know they wanted her to to do all these things but you know she she said no nothing of the world and she said she's that all that god has given me he said all my talent she said is for him and you know they went and they were asking her about you know all these different things you know they got so upset with her but you know he said you know they kind of got peeved at her because she turned down such an opportunity he said she didn't sell her birthrights out like mr presley and them did said she maintained her integrity you know talking about elvis selling selling out as a judas for you know a fleet of cadillacs and a million dollars and a bunch of gold records and all those things and you know what what can you say about all that in in the end time you know as brother branham said you know one of these days you know he will be all shook up when when when he has to stand before the judgment you know and and all these things you know what what has it done for you i mean where does it where does it carry you you know when you look at something and you talk about something being cheap you know do you put value on something you know god saw a lot of value in you that he would go wherever you were that that he would become he would become like us he took on sin that we that we might become the righteousness of god he knew where you were at he knew what we were how we were lost and undone there was no nothing good in us but he but he came and became us that we might become him that we can become the righteousness of god do we see the value in that you know because if your soul is worth ten thousand worlds the bible says you know what what does it profit of man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul or he said what will a man exchange for his soul you know you know what what struck me is is when you when you think of that if i gain the whole world tonight if god values my soul at ten thousand worlds and i only gain one what about the other nine thousand 9999 if you want to talk about cheap i think that exchange rate's pretty cheap i would i would swap a dollar with for ten thousand dollars with anybody any day of the week i think it's pretty cheap but that's what people but you know people don't see the value that god's season he's speaking of brother speaking of a fanny crosby and he was talking about you know he said he said the worst kind of blindness is is not physical blindness he said it's spiritual blindness you know he said because you know fanny might have been physically blind but she wasn't spiritually blind you know and i i always i always loved this this quote you know he said there's a blindness that's worse than physical blindness and that spiritual blindness he said i feel more sorry for them than i do for the physically blind so why wouldn't our hearts reach out for them instead of condemning them let's love them then they'll see light if you'll just love them the worlds are dying not for a better economics the church is dying not for better buildings a bigger denomination but it's dying for somebody to reach out a hand of love to show that we care one for the other he said that's the very sign that jesus told us that by this all men would know that you were my disciples when we got love one for the other he said i was thinking of blind he said it's a little off my subject but not off either he said there was a there was blind family crosby she could see better than a lot of people got two good eyes they tried to get her one time to write music or poetry for the dance world for the entertainment world and she refused to do it so they were making fun of her i thought what a difference it is between her and a certain young pentecostal boy who set the world of fire with rock and roll i've often thought that he's worse than judas judas esau sold his birthright and what a horrible thing that young man will have to answer for at the day of judgment sent more souls to hell than all the bootleg joints there is in the country right but then when fan crossed one day when they come to her with these big bargains she was poor too they come to her and said we'll give you so much if you'll just give your talent over to making songs for the entertainment world she flatly refused it she wouldn't do it i said if there's anything that i have that belongs to christ so those young men were talking to her and i was supposed they're expecting then i i suppose that you're expecting to go to a world where there's everlasting life and so forth she said yes he said what do you expect this christ to be he said he'll be a man so then if you're the same over there that you are here you've never seen him said you're blind so i don't know him anyhow they said how would you ever know him if you're still blind over there and you've never had sight in this life and on the other side there is no sight there how would you ever know him then she said i'll know him and laughed at her and she she turned and started back through the house when she made her decision no sir nothing of the world all my talent is given to christ and they said she started back across the house and raised their hands and she said i shall know him i shall know him and redeem by his side i shall stand i shall know him i shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hands said it's those great crucial moments that the strain is put upon us that god moves in when we make the decision for him that's between life and death that little sharp edge sometime at the last moment when you think you're not going to be well somebody's making fun of you you still hold your testimony that's that's the time that god moves in one amazing thing hold on to your testimony all my talent all the things that that people could receive in this life it's not use for god it doesn't count we can give the world our our best we can give our jobs our best but do we give god our best that's what counts because you know what he gave his all for us didn't hold back one thing from us the scripture tells us then he'll not withhold one good thing from those that walk uprightly you know brother brown said that god wrote a had a checkbook and you know he sat down the day of calvary you know he started signing all those checks all those bank drafts of heaven were signed and you know if if he was here tonight he couldn't give you anything he couldn't heal you why because it's already done you know he was sitting there and he was talking about you know all of those all of those all of those checks are there the question is will you accept them you know one of my favorite one of my favorite quotes and most of you know it but i still love it every time i see it and you know that lady she was poor and didn't have anything and you know charity was trying to help her and they were trying to find out why she was in such a condition that she was in and they started investigating where she was at she had a son that was overseas it's like you know it's like if you had a son and he loved you you know he'd be trying to take care of you said do you hear from me oh yeah i hear from him all the time and he sends me all these sweet pictures and and these letters and and and you know i i hear from him all the time and and it's like oh he sends you sweet letters oh some of the sweetest letters that have ever been written he sends them to me and says said where are they can we see them said sure and so she goes over and picks up her bible and she opens up her bible and it's full of these of these pictures beautiful pictures they're laid right there in the scripture and here it was as they laid there and then they began to look at them and said what were they they were bank drafts she had thousands of dollars that her son had sent her but she didn't even know what they were she just saw pictures but she didn't realize that though once she had nato laid right there in her bible but somebody had to come by and show her what laid in the scripture was exactly what she had need of and there it was when somebody began to point to the scripture and show her what laid there that's exactly what she had need of and brother brother said send you and you can't get warm by a painted fire of pentecost it's not just a pretty picture god sent you that he sent you the the truth he sent you to let you know he said he said that he said he said it's unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call he said that's a bank draft of heaven he said don't don't be afraid to cash it don't be afraid to cash it when you see what god's done for you gave us his best you know if we if we receive god's best then you know we ought to we ought to accept it and walk in the fullness that god has given us not just to come along and be haphazard about it speaking here and questions and answers on hebrews speaking of our body he said you have to have a certain percent of light to make a shadow he said that's the way it is in here he said we both we are both natural and supernatural this body is subject to death and was brought forth by a woman not by nothing but but through not by god you're a reproduction from adam and eve be black white whatever you are you're a production an offspring from adam and eve that makes your body born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies you're damned and condemned at the beginning of your life not even without a chance now because the spirit that you have come to you by nature and by nature coming from sexual intercourse desire by man woman producing an earthly child and let that child alone and don't teach him nothing right he'll go wrong don't teach him neither right no wrong he'll take wrong because it's his nature to do that he said watch a little baby not over higher than that just get some mad he'll ring his hands he'll turn red in the face hold his breath sure what is it it's his nature he got it from his pappy and his mammy won sure he had enough she had enough temper to fight a bus saw or his daddy if they didn't his grandfather grandmother did it's offspring he said it makes you you're born of this world you come here come by nature and your whole being is black and smutty and damned and cursed and going to hell that's right he said but when you're born again then the light of god shines down in that soul hallelujah then it's no more a dark valley but it's a valley with a shadow in it you may be veiled here with the flesh but with things known by faith but there's enough light in there and some that light and darkness has to separate and when the light shines darkness flees and when we go to be with christ in that body darkness and death vanishes and we burst out into perfect light glory to god there we are no more sickness no more dark mixed with it he said right now we have both sin sickness and joy we have health and strength but we have ins and outs and ups and downs joy and sorrow and so forth well it's just a shadow we got enough light to know that there's light there we're still in the body and flesh but someday this body is going to break someday the day's going to break that's when the death angel sets out to the foot of the bed that's when the doctor says it's all finished and this natural comes away from the supernatural and the light springs forth the light springs back to light and darkness goes back to darkness this when this mortal puts on immortality that's when this corruption puts on incorruption that's when this mortal puts on immortality and we become from a creature of time to a creature of eternity you cannot go out there with trolls or darkness you've got to have light in the darkness there you are that's the body you receive so we're born and darkness but you know we've got that light but you know the promise is that it's going to give way all this is going to give way to that light you know he said walking in the valley of the shadow of death he said thou art with me why because you've got to have light to create a shadow it may be darkness but you know what he's still there no matter where you're at he's there with you and we see a lot of darkness and you know that's what the devil wants us to see is a lot of darkness but you know the one thing is is you hold on to the light it may be faint but you hold on to that light because as you hold on to that light then you know what there's a coming of day where it's going to break there's a light coming there's a greater light we'll walk in the light as he is in the light why because he's going to lead you in into greater light and we see that as the day goes on and brother i'm speaking of of the light and as the light progresses and we see that the light shine in in in the east and now it's went to the west and you know now we're seeing the evening light here as the light has grown it's becoming our day that you know the greatest light is now with us and our day that you know the light that shine with in the in the other ages and you know he he spoke about the the light for our day and you know and you know what people get he was he was talking about a man that he uh was uh making fun of of people believing the scripture and he said you know how could he how could god do all the things that he done and and all the things that took place down through history and he said you know he just don't understand how that the seed had to go into the ground and the seed had to abide along but it had to reproduce that the life had to go and all that was it was the cycle of life that it had to go through that it had to go down and you know we see as as he he came and he he birthed those at the day of pentecost and when they came through every age had their life but you know they had to do what their what every age was called for and then you know and they said you know why why did god call why god called why because he anointed a people to go through the dark ages he he to go through those times of persecution and all of that and the death why because they had they had a great testimony for the things that they stood for and went through but you know all that had to play into into the plan of the plan of god for it to come through there and to be birthed and to come through the dark ages and and all the false doctrine and all those things but you know what he became but he began to promise that he was going to bring back and you know he prophesied and told him that he was coming back with light and you know when martin luther received the light of justification and wrote the 95 thesis and stood up there and said you know he said we don't believe in all of this because the just shall live by faith why because it was a great light that began to shine yeah it was yeah it was a lot of darkness and it was a lot of death but you know what it was still a great light that was shining one because those that saw it saw a great light and it began to stay it began to grow and then you know all the way many people didn't see that thing they you know they thought martin luther lost his mind you know he was a heretic and they wouldn't have anything to do with him but you know there was some that were predestinated to that and saw that great light and stood for it and walked walked in in the light that they had and they began to show and you know then there was other ones they began to see and you know wesley and the different ones that came along after that began to walk in the same light that god had given them and began to express the you know the light of the word as it began to open up to come back to the original and you know brothers and sisters and it came back to you and i that we've received the original all the way down through time yeah god winked at their ignorance why because they walked in all the light that they had but you know what it was a great light that was shining but you know god came to the place today you and i are the ones that are the recipients of the full word of god the way that we have the rest that we have received what and you know what all the way back through time you know wesley may not have seen what luther saw and didn't understand all the things that took place one because it wasn't for him but it was for him to pick up the light to pick up the scripture that god shined the light on for him and for him to walk out there and walk in the light of sanctification and to and to live a life that was above reproach to carried on and they began to carry on and you know you know they began those they began to look into the scripture and you know they as they began to see those things and they came and realizing god had something greater than what was already been given you know those being began to stand and and pray you know i i was reading a little little article thing that was uh about the welch revival and you know how the hell that uh the man was was named evan roberts and he began to to cry and pray you know because you know he did not feel satisfied where he was at and you know god had called him and you know he began to pray all the time and began to seek you know they had they had great churches they had great movements but you know he he wanted something more than what they had why because he was crying out because you know what there was more of god that was calling because there was something on the inside crying out one because there was more of god to respond to that and he began to cry out and you know that was the birth of the great welch revival that that there was somebody that was crying out that god had placed on somebody to cry out and receive god and god answered that call you know as they began to look into the scripture there was ones that began to begin to see you know we want to see greater things from god we wanted to have greater movements of god and you know people began to seek these things and and understand that that god had had planned from the day of pentecost you know to come back and daddy seymour knows you know they begin to crowd and they begin to see from the scripture you know another pouring out of the holy ghost and to see the things that god had done back in the day of pentecost could be reproduced again today and as they began to crowd and speak you know then all of a sudden you know the holy ghost began to fall and they began to speak with tongues and all these different things and you know it was a it was a movement of god that god started to move and and open up the word to the people and you know and then they began to see uh you know those that had left the trinitarian doctrine and became into you know understanding the true baptism and the different things as they came along and you know we are we are recipients of those that stood for the truth that god has blessed them and brought them all the way down through and you know brother brad would stood on and began to open these things up and see all these things and point us down through history to show where the where the word of god has been opened up and unveiled it's a wonderful thing to see that what god has done you know that god has because many people you know they they didn't see the opening of the word but when brother branham began to see all the way down through history that corn of wheat going into the ground and dying and being reproduced and bringing back it was the same life in a different stage but it was the same life that came through all the way down it's the same life today and to come back into the grain he said that's what it would be in the last days it would be the same this is from the message things that are to be he said you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation jesus said in matthew the 16th chapter he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you he said what was it a revelation of who he was upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it see the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the bible expresses it's growing in the bible to the full stature therefore if the corn of wheat of christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride to have have to fall in the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes into the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by sending the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt into the age of the earth of the dark age and bring forth again in the days of luther and come on out to the full stature of the bride of jesus christ for this last day see there's no way therefore the bride in the rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it from knew it would be here and then when he made it all that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us and when we get there it's all prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him all these things by foreknowledge and so he continues on and he begins to speak about god being omniscient omnipresent and everything and he begins to speak about our natural birth being presented in the world and god knowing all about these things that would take place and you be coming to an adult and understanding the things that take place in this earth and brother brown and going up brother go up to 40. if you got it there you go he said and so it is with your spiritual birth you do things that you don't understand when you're a little baby come to the altar you give your life to christ you do such strange things you wonder why you did it but after a while when you mature as matured christians then you understand it see there's something picks up see you see why you had to do it your spiritual birth your natural birth types your spiritual how it is fitted to you in this life as you grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that wasn't it a strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission or the tent meeting or the little church somewhere on the corner and some something the preacher preached on a certain subject you just fell right at the altar see god knew that before the foundation of the world see it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand you knew what you knew what happened so it's fitting to you in this life and you will be also in the life that is to come this world and this life seems to advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you so we see these things as it went through all the way down through time all these things came to right to our day everything that we go through it is fitting and god knows what would take place what god what what would take place in our lives and god understands that god knew what was going to take place and all these things and you know we wonder why things happen the way they do but you know god has a plan in all of it a plan and a purpose and all of it and you know it's going to be for his honor and glory and as you as he said in the in our natural birth we see these things and we don't understand why things are as we mature we start to see and understand things well you know as you mature as a christian you begin to see these things and understand why things happen the way they do and the way things happen and and so we start to see these things and what god has done for us and so as we see it's a great thing that god has for us you know it's not it's not to be wrapped up in an imitation you know i don't want it to be just a reproduction i don't want just to be a replica of it but i want i want to i want to i want it to be a production of jesus christ as he was speaking of he said there would be in the last days he said it would come he said it would be a pred it would reproduce jesus christ he said all the way down through the time that he said he said that genuine seed would come again he said it would be sown he said and so it's not just a reproduction not not us trying to make ourselves into something but it's to allow him to make us that we would be the reproduction of jesus christ again in the world to see the world would see jesus christ again today being a son and a daughter of god that's uh that's our goal that's our desire lord mold us in your image lord mold us into what we need to be let's see you i want i wanted to be what he'd have me be i want i want to live the way that he wants me to live let's all stand this evening we'll have the musicians come you know god god saw value in us and it wasn't it wasn't some cheap and i don't want it i don't want to cheap in what he's done for me i don't want to be the world looks for a something easy and something simple you know the life that jesus christ lived it wasn't always simple it wasn't easy you know we all have to have our you know our garden of gethsemane times but you know there's many people they they want to they want to find the easy way out you know they said well i can you know i can do what i want to i don't have to go to church brother brown said you know they said i can i don't have to go to church i don't have to fail a ship i can i can be just as good and he said no you can't you know many people they you know they come and he's like well i just i just want to hear hear what the prophet has to say and i'm just going i'm just going to listen to the prophet you know and then you know they they want to throw off you know well i don't need a pastor i don't i don't need a five-fold ministry i'm just i'm just going to hear it from the prophet i'm just going i'm just because you know that's thus saith the lord and not realizing that what they've done is they is they've is they've taken themselves away from the grace of god you know as as that's the reason why i was reading that scripture brother brown said the quote there where he was talking about physical blindness and fanny crosby knew somebody spiritual blindness spiritual blindness is worse and he said to reach out to him and love him you know there's so many that you know you don't you don't know how what to say to them you just try to reach out and you think about people that you know they've got into this thing where you know i don't i i i get it myself you know no you can't god god placed in the body and you know if he placed in the body he placed a five-fold ministry in the body and if ephesians 4 was placed in the body was placed in the scripture then show me where he took ephesians 4 out because it has it has great value to me because if not then we like i said we could we can make it a cheap imitation and it and it's very it is very sad because you know many people have stand up today and you know they they say well you know we have we have a tape ministry and we have a fivefold ministry and you know what they're in and in the true fivefold ministry there ain't a single one of them that i know of that's going to stand in front and tell you you can't listen to tapes it's it's for you to listen to the tapes they encourage you to listen to the tapes you better be in the tapes you better be in the words you better be listening i mean i don't know anybody that say well you better not listen to this you better you know because if if somebody's trying to hold you back from from reading and getting into the words you know what that's not the fivefold ministry they're pointing you back to the word you know and and as brother said in the church age book he said he said there was a voice of many waters he said it was the voice and i didn't bring this quote but he said the voice of the ministers in each age and when you go back to look at he said the voice well there's only one voice well i'm not you know i i don't want to think that say that that i'm trying to speak speak in my own self because if i was going to do that i just sit down but it's but it's god speaking glory and if it and if it's him speaking he said it was the voice of the ministers plural ministers is plural the voice of the ministers in each age glory age being singular right he didn't say the voice of the ministers in the ages but he said the ministers in each age so there's more than one in each age so when he began to speak that he's bringing out there's a fivefold ministry for every age and there's a and so we're not we're not trying to do away with it and and so many people have have raised up and they're they are saying you know well it wasn't so from the beginning it wasn't so from the beginning well you know they tell you something you may tell you something that wasn't from so from the beginning a tape player a tape player never was so from the beginning let me tell you something else because everybody says well we have to listen to the voice of the prophet well let me tell you something else a prophet wasn't so from the beginning because if we go back brother bram said we're going back to eden condition god come and spoke to adam and eve they had fellowship face to face with each other that was so from the beginning let me tell you something else that wasn't so from the beginning close wasn't so from the beginning well if we're going to just start saying well that's so what so from the beginning went so from the beginning well there's a lot of things we need to cut out but you tell me if the five-fold minister you showed me where the five-fold ministry was taken out and i'll show you where it was put in you showed me where it was taken out but you showed me where god put a tape player in he called me and he didn't call a tape player but you know what each one every man that's been called of god has been called to stand and they proclaim the message that brother branham brought the fulfillment of revelation 10 7 came to voice and it began because revelation 10 8 began to speak so there's somebody that's got to stand and speak not stood around and said listen to a tape player well i can't say nothing we just got to push play i'm i'm i'm sorry i just i'm sorry i'm not sorry i'm sorry for the fan jew but it it don't offend me it offended me that when people when people have have taken the word of god and what god has given us and they've and they've cheapened it oh yeah come on that's it and then and all you can do is all you can do is make an imitation of it because you know they they say well you know they've done away with they've done what so much well well it's so much easier we can just sit behind sit somewhere in our in our recliners and listen to brother branham and we don't have to have anybody call our sin out and point our fingers at us and tell us where we're wrong and they said well brother branham comes and corrects me [Music] well i know i know there's a lot of them that you see a lot of things that go on and you know what who's correct in that so but you know i i thank god that god has given us a fivefold ministry amen god has given us a pastor that has stood faithfully behind the desk and he's action well all i can i can say anybody else can say whatever they want to but brother branham said he said he gave you a pastor he said he's ordained a god to lead you through he said get behind your pastor so i want to be behind my pastor and i want to apologize to everybody here because you know what i don't want to cheapen any of this but i'm just going i'm just going ahead and see it i don't nobody won't have any surprises i'm just i'm just honest like it brother wade's words of exhortation and rebuke were mine anybody want to know who they belong to they belong to me and i'm not ashamed to say that because you know what the bible tells me that a bastard's the only one that won't stand correction and i apologize to brother wade and brother dale and i apologize to all of y'all because i don't i don't ever do anything to offend anybody the bible tells me that a brother offended is harder one than a strong city and you know anytime that there's anything that's ever done that stands between anybody in the body and that's where the devil can attack that's where the devil is going to stand and play and i want i want to be the one to be right and i and and i just i want to say this whether whether i preach again or not doesn't doesn't matter to me if brother dale set me down i would i wouldn't i wouldn't mind at all i'm not i'm you know because i'm not going to be one that's going to have a you know carry a chip on my shoulder or anything like that we're in such a late hour i don't you know if anything's done wrong it needs to be corrected and we all need to stand up and and take her and say thank the lord and just move on it needs to be put under the blood [Applause] and if anybody thinks that that you know that preachers are any better than anybody else well you're dead wrong because i don't want i don't want to be just an imitation i want to be the genuine i know where the dale brother wake forgive me that's not a problem i know brother wade and them wouldn't they wouldn't think nothing of it they forget it know the lord does sometimes the hardest to do is forgive ourselves to not let it stand in our way so y'all pray for me and i appreciate them standing up saying what they have to say and if anybody else you know you know you have to walk your own way so you know if people you know people get upset about things well that's y'all have to deal with your own your own journey your own problems your own feelings but you know i just want to apologize to everybody here because you know what i don't i don't want to be a stumbling block i don't want to be a hindrance and some my prayer is to be better because this is the greatest thing that we have is the word and you know what this is the word so god bless you tonight we're going to sing a song i want to live the way he wants me to live [Music] there's just no more love could never ever [Music] until there's just no more to give [Music] i could never ever [Music] he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love to you there's just no more love i could never ever this is a day this is the day that the lord has made that the lord has made i will rejoice i will rejoice and be glad and be glad in it this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice [Music] this is the day that the
