those 50 50s something years and uh to uh have brother Mo as our first pastor and brother Dale as our second pastor and and that's been a long time we we now had to go through a bunch of administrations we appreciate that um remember brother Aaron he is a brother Tom cranes today uh speaking uh remember on July July 14th 15th and 16th now downstairs will be um a sign up sheet for you to sign up to go now this is for anyone this is kind of like Ohio it's for anyone to go we were going to have we are going to have a youth service on Saturday but we'll have regular church service on Sunday but anybody is welcome to go all right now the cut off is June the 24th which will be a few weeks from now June the 24th or 25th somewhere that Sunday if you want to go and you need we're going to the reason we need to know is we're going to double up the church will be paying for your motel room so we'll be doubling up now and we'll double up on carpool but the church will be providing the room that's why I need to know who's coming who's going to be there Friday and Saturday all right everybody say Amen all right I had lost you yet but food and gas is your responsibility outside of what we're going to do at the venues now I talked to brother Andre yest yesterday Friday we're going to kind of get there when you can or when you want to it's just going to be a fellowship at the unicy park from 5: until whenever uh but whenever you get there uh he's already rented that place and on Saturday we're not going to have it at brother uh Andre's Church we're going to have it he has rented the Methodist uh Camp Community Center all day so it'll be basketball volleyball we're going to have a worship service with specials get your specials ready youth that are going and even adults at probably around 5 but I got to get with brother Joe uh and brother Joe can get with brother Andre about the song Service uh we'll find out maybe who's going to speak that afternoon and if we can get Louis there in time maybe we can do it later on the afternoon all right Sunday will be a regular service and I'll be speaking Sunday morning there's not an afternoon service but I need to know downstairs when you you see that sheet of paper this is important if you're going to stay over now it's about a 3 and 1 half hour drive it's very easy to get there 3 and 1 half hours from here sorry uh and then you maybe a little bit further in Atlanta but on Sunday afternoon after the service is over we're going to go to a place called The Farmer's Daughter and it's an Amish Restaurant They're they've got a place to hold about 50 people in the back excuse me and brother Andre's got that reserve for us for Sunday it is a Amish I mean meat and it ain't a meat and three it's like a meat and 30 cuz it's an Amish place and they raise her own vegetables they raise her own beef they raise all that stuff at The Farmer's Daughter afterwards so I need to know who's going to stay over for that meal now you will be responsible for that meal also but now whatever we eat at at the two camps which will be Friday evening will'll be sandwiches and stuff like that uh Saturday we got to get that menu nailed down but like I said before please let us know just like we did with Ohio we'll have an itinerary and uh let you know when to be there and what's going on but the church will pay for the motel you just need to get there and the food that you eat outside of the venue will be your responsibility so we appreciate brother Dale pay for the motel rooms cuz that's the biggest expense is a place to stay so brother Andre said he did not have a place to put 45 people and that's how many signed up to go at the moment so if you want to go though please sign up we want everybody to go we will have service here that Sunday regardless there will be a service here on that Sunday and we'll give you that itinerate later on so all M's clear Lord bless you thank you for being tentative attentative and for helping in all this and let's go to the Lord in prayer just remember these ones that are sick and not here remember the ones that are on vacation dear heavenly father Lord we're standing here in our Humanity knowing that without you lord we're totally insufficient we have have nothing to say but father if you'll just speak for a little while to your people Lord you be the active participant in this service you do the speaking father you do the revealing Lord and I pray that you would you would heal all sick Lord from their body all the way to their soul cuz many souls are sin sick in this hour Lord but they can be healed there's a bomb that will cover that Lord there's also a bomb that'll cover the healing of the body and father we pray that you would Quicken that to us today bless the ones that are here with us the ones that's visiting and coming in they're really not visitors they've been here before but we sure appreciate them coming Lord in this rainy day oh again thank you Lord for this rain Lord the the the perole garden was crying out yesterday thank you so much for giving us rain and father I pray that you'd be with us now and further in this service in Jesus name we pray amen we've been speaking on the son of man which we've really uh been on the statue of a perfect man we're on godliness this is Part 111 yes Jonathan I am slow but we're breaking it down pretty much so this is part 11 11 so let's begin with John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word became flesh or was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now we know that's Jesus 2,000 years ago but what about in your flesh what about when he comes by the New Birth and comes into you and makes your flesh huh the word all right that's what we got to we got to see that the statue of perfect man is making us into His Image molding us into his likeness and we beheld his glory the GL the only begotten of the father full not halfway full of grace and truth you may be seeing the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word second Peter 1:5 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity he had a man that had a problem with all these but once he got the new birth he was able to pin it into the Eternal Word of God a man named Peter Peter had issues but God said I prayed for you he said I prayed for you Peter I I know you're going to get sifted like like wheat he get behind me say now he was always letting Peter have it well if he let Peter have it then guess what he let Peter have this Revelation right here that somebody that way an old naked sailor come on somebody an old naked sailor he could have him write this and it be the Eternal Word of God and that we can sit in 2023 and see that we have to become that amen no going back we have to be this yes sir we're not walking backwards as we're walking forward all right 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy all right great is the mystery of godliness there is a mystery connected to Godliness and you got to get all the way up and you got to have you got to have virtue and you got to have knowledge and Temperance patience all that working in your life and then God requires that you become Godly now I read you a quote I did last week where brother Brown said what somebody said oh brother R I can't do that he said oh yes you can now we believe God sent a prophet right we believe that his words are the words that transferred from the mind of God down through him that little Kentucky Englishman and he spoke and said yes you can amen yes you can all right I then I think there is a way amen that we can do it we just got to get in that way not our way this afternoon Lord willing we're going to start on brotherly kindness but the first word we're going to look at is selfishness come on selfishness amen there is nowhere selfishness should be in Christianity I'll read it to you I don't think I don't have quote but look Paul said without controversy so in other words there's no disputation I'm not going to sit here and argue whether you say well I can be Godly and I can't or I can't and I said you can't you can there is a way though that you've got to get into in that plan and and God saw Listen by for knowledge what did God do he saw somebody make it amen under this plan yes sir he saw a group of people in the end time they made it they came in the open book they understand the healing of the Soul they understand the healing of the body they know that the healing of the soul is is eternal but healing the body is temporary all right is everybody with me so there was a mystery and God gave us a prophet that could go down and he would say he would say well cancer starts as a bruised cell now that wasn't in any science book book that wasn't in the amaama that wasn't in John Hopkins that was in the mind of God he knew that that cell started that part of cancer and he could tell you by what by a vision by somebody by him knowing that there was a great mystery so let's look at that just for a minute because if there's a mystery of godliness we need to see the mystery all right and I we know what the mystery of godl is godliness is because Paul told us what it was was right it's Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery so a mystery is what a hidden thing a secret religious Secrets confided only to the initiated now when you got up this morning and you said I'm coming to church well you didn't say you coming to church you said you said uh uh maybe I don't want to go but the one inside of you said let's go okay oh I'm the only one that has that problem oh okay all right we'll pray for me me so you initiated something inside of you that says I'm going to hear from God am so you initiated an act you you said I'm going to get up and go right and not to ordinary Mortals if it was the ordinary Mortals this place would be packed full of people if that's what they wanted but we have a hidden secret a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding none of these are obvious to the understanding sure man has their own uh knowledge they have their own Temperance and different things but it's totally contrary to God yes sir all right so we got to look at the things that are Godly all who live Godly in Christ what shall what suff suffer persecution all right number three is a hidden purpose so if there's a mystery behind it it's just it's not just going to be I'm going to unfold this and then let the air out of the balloon no no it just keeps un unfolding and what you see is you see the secret hidden Mystery of God and where he is the secret Council which govern God in dealing with the righteous that's us which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to the godling so a mystery should be plain to us uh the prophet of God tells us one place he says the Myster is now what history we have an open book back during the back during the part of the 2,000 years of church ages there was a great mystery what is this seven seal what is this Elijah coming in Malachi 4 all they you know they tried their best to hit it but they couldn't it took a prophet in the end time to bring us the word of God to open that mystery up and say not William brandom saying here I am Christ saying here I am in you all right brother Brandon was the most unselfish person in the world so we can put him up there where we can can see at brotherly kindness that that's why that his son said Remember the greatest one of the greatest qualities of his dad was he didn't you couldn't tell who was his enemies or friend in other words when him and Billy would drive down the road for thousands of miles remember he didn't like to fly when they drive down the road from Jeffersonville to Arizona at that time it was probably about a 20 something hour trip because it wasn't many interstates back at that time they talked so you know what Billy Billy's telling us he's telling us that brother brandom didn't spend two hours talking about one preacher let that sink in he didn't spend two hours at the table complaining or telling you Billy how wrong this person is or how wrong this church is or how wrong this preacher is bil he couldn't tell so brother Bram I'll read you in just a minute well no I'll read you this afternoon brother Brown said he got a selfish Spirit on him I'll read it to you brother brandom yeah you know what if you'll read a lot he had plenty of complexes Colossians 1: 211 says you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled where in the body of his flesh through death to present you what read that with me holy and unblamable and unre reproval in his side all right not the sight of the world but in his sight yes if big word if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard yes you have heard the gospel you have no excuse amen and which was preached to you wait a minute and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every cre creature which is under Heaven yes wherefore I Paul and made a minister I like Paul's boldness but you know what he could back it up amen who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church in other words Paul being unselfish he's G listen he didn't have to go to prison he didn't have to go before Pilate I mean um um in Rome he didn't have to the Holy Spirit even warned him to go to Rome right he went anyway now he wasn't out of the will of God he was fulfilling what God saw happen in his life but Paul knew I I believe that little part of Paul was always saying man I've got this thing thing because I put a lot of Christians to death amen I persecuted the very church that I'm ahead of so so I'm going to give myself for that church unselfish we'll talk about that this afternoon wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God now watch even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations but now is made manifest to the Saints now Paul is standing in probably the year ad50 something or 60 something right before he died he's standing there telling us the mystery that was hid from back in the Old Testament until today all righty and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints so they got a mystery un unfolding but they didn't get it all to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom look that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus Bible I'm just telling you what the Bible said all right wherefore I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily boy he had something inside of him that he had to get out so we come to this and we see that Paul Paul is telling us that the great mystery is is going to be that that God's going to inhabit a group of people in their human flesh even though they are born in sin even though that that they might be healed and and and and temp It's All Temporary to the outside all right you can be healed of cancer today and die tomorrow now that's what brother BR said because what happens is you get that you get whatever you got you get that taken out of of you but the fall was I was thinking about this yesterday that fall was so horrible that it separated God and man here stands Adam and Eve nothing going on full Fellowship their bodies being renewed they're not getting older they're not stooping over for hundreds of thousands of years they walked through the garden with God but all of a sudden the fall happened and then the presence of God was separated so that he can't deal with man like he used to so what did he do he took that he put the curse on his flesh remember he didn't curse Adam he didn't curse Adam Sal he couldn't he can't curse his own self if you're born again today you're not under the curse he has revealed to you yes sir that you are head and he can't curse himself Hallelujah you're covered by his blood he can't ever if he ever loved you he can't unlove you don't ever say God don't love me no more no he don't love you no less either he's loved you from the beginning he can't unlove you you can unlove yourself but when Jesus was here he said okay we're going to have this great mystery I'm going to come into these people I'm going to come and be the I'm the Holy Ghost cuz that's what now you can um agree with me or not but when we're in the Garden of Eden there stands God and Adam and there's nothing in between all right there's no there's no wall total just there's there's really no Mysteries now God withholds a mystery because he knew they were going to fall but he didn't tell Adam because Adam was a free moral agent he let Adam choose right all right we're all on free moral agency preached on that several several weeks you didn't come here with eternal life and just Lock Stock in Barrel sealed and ready to go I'm sorry you were born in sin now you had representation in the Bible and the word of God you had representation but when you got here you was Dirty Rotten filthy born in sin shap in iniquity the prophet said bound he said I was on my way to hell but thank God Jesus now we take John 3:16 as as the Lord's Prayer right Our Father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done all that to me that's to the world to me that's that's to the world like we were talking about last Sunday there's a big difference between being saved and being born again amen big difference you can be saved and be lost and go to hell but you can't be born again and be lost and go to hell so there's a difference and saved people can be can be given eternal life but they don't have eternal life all right believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved now that would be if somebody wanted to give their heart at a deathbed confession or or or something like that and they died they would not go into sixth Dimension cuz that's where we would go if we pass away which is the born again but they would be somewhere and then at the day of judgment they would be given eternal life right but if you're born again like I said before you can be saved and not be born again but you can't be born again and not be saved amen everybody with me all right you got to go through that salvation plan and if you stop that's your business but the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ there's a lot of people going to be saved that's not going to be in this group that Jesus came to get he wouldn't at all be saved but when he come down to the very end yes he died for every person but he knew this group right here would be the only group he was going that was going to receive his Blessing of eternal life and that's his bride or his body is everybody with me John 17:10 says and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them amen hallu where's the glory of God me and you but listen you tell the world that and first thing you going to say what I'm ain't perfect and you ain't perfect don't tell me you perfect well I'm not God told me I was perfect and now I am no more now see this to me this is the bride's prayer brother John this is Jesus praying to put to put a comforter he said he was going to come back send a comforter that lead us and guide us into all truth right the true Holy Ghost and our soul not just an anointing on our spirit realm or even an anointing on our bodies everybody with me we know this is is Anointed ones at the end time time all right and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world now remember I told you Jesus didn't say father Shield them from the world put a bubble around them make sure that make sure that they don't get no bills no more when they get born again make sure they car don't tear up make sure your house gets somehow supernaturally painted and for your sisters super clean I wish everybody with me that's when your problem start is when you become a Christian all right you might get an extra bill but uh but the world's not going to realize and understand you they're not going to understand us they never will cuz listen I'm gonna read it right here Jesus said you're of me if the world hated me they're going to hate you but I prayed for you Peters I prayed for you I prayed for you bride this is the prayer to the bride and now I'm no more in the world but these are in the world I come to thee Holy Father keep through thy own name now what is the name of the Father the Lord Jesus Christ we know that whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are oh but brother wait I can't be the Bible says yes you can Jesus prayed a prayer have you ever heard a prayer of Jesus now listen we prayed a lot of prayers that didn't come to pass hello Jesus never prayed a prayer that didn't come to pass though all right so I'm going to tell you this prayer is going to come to pass while I was with them in the world I kept them in my name oh yeah he hearded those 12 and one of them was a son of predition those that thou givest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them Thy word amen we'll talk about in a minute that word is a seed all right and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil that's in the world they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth that's why the word is the most important thing in our life is getting the word of God and getting it down right as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world so he's not put them in a bubble he's not put them in a camp hello somebody he's not put him in a commune he put you in the world to rub shoulders with the world for the world to see Christ in you the hope of glory as thou has sent me in the world even so I have sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray now here he's praying again neither pray I for these alone what this 12 but for them also ask me which Shall Believe on me through the words they preach that they all might be 12 14 18 23 no one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US protect me Lord put me inside of you again that the world may believe that thou has sent me the glory which thou gavest me I took with me oh he says I have given them that they may be one even as we are one how many times has he said that that's about the third time I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me Romans 8 HS and join HS whatever he gets we get father I will that they also whom thou givest me be with me where I am he wasn't just want y'all to be in the world that's right he's taking you to a place where he's at and we got to come to that place spiritually here amen hello somebody we got to come to that place spiritually here where we walk like Christ did with the headstone the statue of perfect man we'll get into that later on that they may behold my glory where in a book on a tape no in your flesh and your life your everyday walk where I am that they may behold my glory yes which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world now wait a man hold on what did Jesus say that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world right now hold on a minute and the glory which thou givest me I give them H that they may be one even as we are one he must have loved us before the foundation of the world Amen and what do we do we got to give it back right there's a connection there everybody with me so there's the prayer to the bride to keep us from the evil not take us out of the evil now we're going to be taken out I promise you when the Rapture takes place we're going to be out of here we're not going to stand any of this junk that's going on now but we still have to live here and be what functional Christians yes someone walking talking breathing the word of God not just quoting it I mean the message that's what the devil says the devil can say that but the message is not in him but you can say the message is in you amen John 17 what is the message the good news it's the gospel uh was listening to um um song this morning you know when the trumpet sounds the dead are going to rise you know and we shall rise and bring all

and go right you ask somebody out in the world what's going to all that trumpet we're going to hear that trumpet sound it's sounding now in the gospel it's sounding according to brother brandom it's here the trumpet sounding will be a bride standing on the earth at the end time that says death you don't have any dominion over us and now death come on somebody you don't have any dominion over them that are in that other dimension bring them here we're going home but we got a journey to go through it's not just we're not going from kindergarten to college Renee it have been that easy wouldn't it know it wasn't if you'd be in college be in kindergarten be drawn on the wall no you have to go to process you have to grow up all right they've all grown into fine individuals Bob and Sharon's done a good job with their kids we sure appreciate that I mean BR being Sharon Bob done a good job with his too don't tell your daddy I called you Daddy no do it please I'll pay you Genesis 171 when Abram was 99 nobody here's 99 there's one getting close but the Lord appeared to Abram and said I am almighty God walk before me and try to be thou perfect oh it says and be thou perfect Now That Word Perfect is what complete morally innocent having Integrity one who is morally and ethically pure and like I said before when we look at the word godliness we see reverence respect piety towards God and remember I gave you a list for those of you that wer here we talk about living godliness and then brother rown says right here said you're moving right on up the line fifthly add godliness Temperance patience wow you say I can't do that brother random oh yes you can you can live this godliness you say well I I what do I do listen but when we are judged we're going to read this this afternoon at the communion service but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord now that word is instructed we are instructed on how to be this godliness that we should not be condemned with the world St John 17 he took us out of the condemnation of the world we we are not condemned with the world everybody that's not born again is condemned with the world whatever the world gets they get I don't care if you foolish virgin I don't care if you just saved if you're not filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost today by the new birth in your soul the old you dead and the New Life coming in to live it through you you will be here when the world is judged sorry about that Noah didn't shut the ark God did God's getting ready to shut the ark I told you before we're going to talk about it back again um in just a second but uh I have a list um and I want you to kind of think about it you see I can't live Godly I can't live this godliness which is piety which is which is uh Perfection as the world would say but we would say it would be completion or how complete we are but not complete according to the world Amen we are complete according to the Bible amen everybody with me well I can't I can't I don't we're not a denomination that makes us closer to God than the denominations CU we've been taught we'll talk about the horse forehead in a minute you sisters don't cut your hair well that's what the Bible says so guess what 99.9% of the people in this world are not living Godly because they cut their hair but you are you are living Godly all right dress the world don't mind wearing pants they don't even mind wearing shorts to church now they have no respect but you do and then we've had some that come in Among Us the new people that come in wearing pants the girl the ladies and brother Dale never never got down and and and you know nailed them to a tree you just preach the word something's got to change from inside anyway a lot of y'all I mean a lot of y'all if you if you're wearing pants now then you know you're not born again number one see what I mean you've moved yourself from godliness over to this group right uh what about your actions and as I said before uh many big churches and I'm not knocking them they're doing the best they can but most churches have the program for the widowed a program for the divorced a program for the divorced singles a program for the you you understand for the for the alcoholics the a program for the smokers do we need to add on to the church huh well then we're living more Godly than they are everybody with me on this all right our manner of life we don't smoke drink cuss I I hope you never get a DUI that means you're drunk but but if you don't ever drink brother johnan if you never drink we don't if you never drink that law of of uh blowing 08 or whatever it is to make you legally drunk that's to you don't even worry the books I don't even worry about it I don't keep up with that but man I'm telling you the people at home being the mayor of the city oh Lord they want to have alcohol in the communion store and they want to have all this stuff they're worried about that now I'm not not worried about it you shouldn't be worried about where the beer cost $6 a can instead of five but there a lot of people got up this morning cussing about yeah we say cussing cussing about all that do y'all have to do you worry about that no well you're living more Godly than the world you're living more Godly than 99% of the denominational world right you're clean amen according to his divine power has given us all things that what pertain un to life yes we have life lessons here because we live a life I would love sister Nikki for my life to be Godly 100% of the time sorry pray for me if you are pray for me I ain't we need he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be but we live more more Godly than the world does obviously now we've living more Godly than the denominations which the Bible says they have a horse forehead I know it's a Str a strong word to use but explain it to your kids if you need to explain to them we know what a is a hor some person that can't contain their s everybody with me yeah all right and it's in the Bible yes sir we'll talk about it in just a second cuz that's what this world's come to and we're not we're out of that we don't have a horse forehead if you're not in if you're not born again you have one already am I with you are you with me I don't want to hurt your feelings but if you're not born again you have a horse forehead you are selfish we'll read about it later talk about it later on we don't have to worry about what bar is closed and what bar is open right just want to make sure that we be not condemned with the world the world's over here and get their condemnation you and I have come out of the world we're over here living listen we fall that's what Grace is for listen God didn't want to take Grace and put on shelf Grace is to be used Redemption is to be used it was given for us to use it so use it now listen don't use greasy Grace but now listen if you're in Greasy Grace get born again and then it'll start being some good grace some good grace that if you do make a mistake you do say something sideways to somebody God forgive me had a Gody tell me yesterday on the phone it worried him to death somebody passed away and he owed him $10 so he said he went to the grave and he said he said um buddy he Saidi sorry the guy just died well it was um James La yeah James La uh he was a motor builder for um Bill Elliott back in the 80s and he was like well known all over the the community well he passed away so this guy walks up and he says man I'm sorry he said I owed you $10 I'm sorry there's nothing I can do about it he said there was another man standing beside of him at the grave said he looked over him he said he don't need it now but you know that stuff like that bothers you because you live more Godly than than than somebody saying I cheated him out of $10 and I'm happy about it right listen when people steal stuff they don't steal it to be sad they steal it to be happy hey man somebody have you ever thought about that they don't steal something go I just got $12 million in Diamond no you never see him again if he don't get caught he's over in the Bahamas somewhere living it up he's happy that's why Satan is happy when he seals your Victory I want us to make him the most miserable person on the face of the Earth and in another dimension and you know what he's even in [Applause] heaven I want him to be nervous real nervous I want him to be pill taking nervous thought I'd throw that in there but this whole thing is is is what we've been the series we've been on I hope it's been helping us in our life and helping us to be more Godly than we have before brother John's teaching us how to do the Life part and the godlin part through money and through finances and and all that we really appreciate that cuz you know what it's the whole thing there's people and and out in the world uh you know you get these scammers call you and you get people call you about social security they will not call you about that on the cell phone all right they'll send you a letter I work for the Post Office the IRS will not contact you on the phone they send you a letter through the post office everybody with me life lesson here don't get on the phone and let them tell you you owe them $2,000 and you buy dumb as a rock if you give them your number but I had a girl one time at the post office young girl she was on the phone had it on speaker I walked in from working and there it was she had owed $2500 more dollars they said on her taxes and they were going to send the sheriff out the next day with a warrant for her arrest if she didn't pay that $2,500 well they went through this and Kelly's like didn't mean to call her name she said I know I I let me call my let me call my um account it let me call and I'm over there going hang up she this is serious well see that's how much they had scammed her I mean this is serious I said no it's not so what I done is I immediately pulled up IRS scam well there was five things on my phone and I went over there and I said read this he's done all five while I've been standing here she said oh Lord she H she just HS the phone up then and she said I was getting ready to give them my number well they'd have pulled more than $2,500 if it' have been just if it' have been more than that in your account but listen the point is there are people in this world that are scammers that get up in the morning go to work just like you get up and go to work to a public good paying job honest job they get up and do the same thing to scam you to mess you out of your hard earned money but you know what that's over here they will be condemned with the world I hope they never do it to a bride of Jesus Christ I'll promise you the fires of Hell will rain down on them so but you don't get you don't don't do that okay don't no information on the phone I don't care if it sounds good what's your say if it sounds good is what too good to be true yeah all right now life lesson number 743 now going and besides this giving all diligence so we're going to work on life we're going to work on godliness and besides this giving all diligence add add what so look let's look at this just for a minute we were looking at it last Sunday let's look at it just for a minute for the for the ones that weren't here we got we're looking at the analogy or the um the parable of the SE of the seed now remember who is the S the SE is the son of man the ministry that today I am sowing hopefully I'm sowing good seed all right but now remember the ground is you that's right the ground is your if you came in with a bad attitude where's that seed going to land if you come in with something on your heart that's why I said you better get it rid get rid of it right back there and then come in here and enjoy the service but we know the seed is a word of God every time God talks about a seed in the Bible and brother Ram talks about a seed he's talking about not talking about some Wiggly Little sperm with a tail on it everybody with me that is not what God is all about Adam's seed polluted the world his natural sperm polluted the world Amen brother Brown said that we should know it without a quote but the seed is the word or the sermon you hear or the Bible you read all right and the ground is your Earth not this Earth your Earth today you come to get spiritual water if the word has been planted if there's no word there it ain't coming up CU there's no seed there to come up everybody with me so everybody knows the parable of the sore of the seed so we're going to continue on down a little bit further CU remember he explained it in detail hear you therefore the parable of the all right soar is who son of man the ministry we're under the son of man Ministry we're under the ministry of the so of the seed all right we have a former rain which is this rain right here which is a teaching rain which is when you plant the seed I needed this rain for my crops I planted some extra ones yesterday so praise God they'll come up the other ones didn't because it didn't have good moisture all right so then there will be a rain in September are around October that will be a harvest rain that'll be the rain right at the end that pops everything to maturity that makes that corn of wheat get real heavy and hang over cuz it's become back to the original that's when my apple trees in September those thing those limbs that I used to cut grass underneath and didn't hit my head I hit my head all the time on apples why they they they're coming to maturity they're heavy the apples are big then you get that last rain and you know you look at your corn Shucks and and they start drying out you need that one more good rain to just make everything and that's the same way with me and you we're going to have that one more good rain I believe we're having it now yes sir to mature the bride to get us ready for Harvest to get us ready to get out of here amen this world is not my home I'm just a passing through right my Treasures are laid up where here no somewhere beyond the blue all right hear you therefore the parable of the sword when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown look in his heart now remember be careful that is not the heart of the soul of you Satan can't steal anything out of your soul your soul is sealed until the day of your Redemption Satan can't make your soul sin he can't make your soul make a mistake we ought to be happy in that if you're sealed in he's sealed out but now that second realm that we're working memory reason conscious AFF and Imagination that is his playground God has allowed him yes that access to your brain to your memory your reason your conscious effect imagination there's the Battleground listen there is there's no battle in your soul if you're born again it's God if you're not it's the devil that's just plain as black and white all right so what are we dealing with here with the Statue of perfect man though we're dealing with that second realm or that Spirit realm of man you you so sometimes we do hear the word but you remember in Ezekiel remember he gives he takes the only heart out and gives you a new new heart brother BR said that's not the new birth all right he's trying to soften you up under sanctification to get you ready for God to come in and we've been taught that for 50 something years so we know that's the truth but now that's sanctification that's not the Holy Ghost the good man of the house oh sure everything's been cleaned out but there's the devil going to come back according to Luke right unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks and D places comes back comes back finds the house swept and garnished but the doors are still open it's not been sealed you need to get it sealed until the day of your Redemption therefore he cannot get into your that part of your house when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not that means you didn't study that means you didn't prepare yourself that means you just came here cuz you was afraid I'd say something if you didn't praise the Lord anyhow then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart we've seen that they come here they disappear this is he which receives seed by the wayside in other words on their way they sat down in the church and heard of a message and it sounded good it sounded different I know something you don't know but you got to know Christ first you got to get born again first I Pro listen I promise you you get born again it will take you to the message because it has to lead you and guide you into all truth not just some truth all right so you get the Holy Ghost first that's why brother Bown said most important get the Holy Ghost and it will drive you to the message listen folks you you don't don't have to I was listening to a preacher the other day he said you don't have to beg a Christian to come to church right and we still beg and they still don't come but he that receiveth what the ministry the seed into Stony places what you got some issues you had a problem with your wife on the way to church or your kids on the way to church you got that Stony heart you sat here and work worry about I don't for me to be quiet so you can go outside and bless your wife out or wait a minute vice versa are your kids or your neighbor whether I get home I'm going to church but a time out but when I get back and I'm going to drive two or three people off the road getting there road rage yeah it happens the same as he that heareth the word now watch here's another one but he that receive seed into Stony place is the same as he that he at the word all right and a non with joy receive it oh man this is great bro wait I felt something I don't want you to feel something I want you to live something like Brother D said if you want some feelings I'll put an ice cube down your back y'all be shouting and speaking in tongu that's what I told William Bon he was staying with us in our when when we put the shower in we put the it's one of them that does this and it says hot on this side and cold on this side well me and dad put it together backwards I don't know if he did it just to play with them cuz that's where we put all the preachers at so he went over to the hot side it stayed cold he never did go he said this is hot he said it must be something wrong with the hot water heater so he gets in there and you can hear him he come out I said you in there speaking in tongues he said that water's cold I said ain't nothing worse than a cold preacher I said if you'll turn it on the other side so we put a little thing jun's laughing now I'm sure that we put a little sign that says it's backwards for use this is the hot over here where it says see but he that receive a SE life lesson 769 don't ever do that to a preacher the same as he that Hearth the word and we receive it with joy shout speak your tongue yet hath not root he didn't sit there long enough or she to get rooted and grounded to that when the wind did blow it didn't knock your plant over some people it knocks them out of church some people that want it so bad their feet that tree bends them Roots get loose but they don't fall over they might get loose a little bit why they're loosening the soil up so they can grow some more they're loosening the soil that's why Wind Blows yeah he that hath no root in himself but endureth for a Time hangs around for a little while for when tribulation or persecution arise uhoh because of what not somebody because of the word by and by He Is offended he also that receive seed among Thorns is he that heareth the word here's a sermon comes to church and the cares of this world well I got to work on Sunday I can't get here on Wednesday cuz I got to work some of you have to and I understand but don't make it an excuse if you make it your crutch then you're in this part right here and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word now the word's not choked you are you're choking the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that received seed and good ground we just going to say we all had good ground today he that received seed or heard the message or the word of God into good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 some 60 and some 30 not everybody's going to be a 100 amen not every there's going to be a lot of 60 and a lot of 30 which means it's a 30% though is just as important as the 100% all right everybody with me so there's that Parable then let's look for a second of this horse horse forehead because I want you to understand there was a question about this it does sound awful and it is awful God hates it there's a lot of things God hates you know that look it up in the Bible God hates a lot of things so when Jeremiah talks about therefore the showers have been withholden and there have been no latter or rain in other words no Harvest rain seed's been planted but it was wrong timing and thou Hast a forehead thou refuses to be ashamed now that word means highly fed and therefore wanting in other words to commit fornication be a harlot to be unfaithful to God cuz he told Israel one time he said you've went whing and I had to put you away what were they doing they were s sacrificing to other Idols are you sacrificing today to other Idols to something that's keeping you out of church something that's keeping you away from The Fellowship Of God with God and with his people right to play the Harlot to cause to commit adulter to adultery or to commit fornication but I like that says highly fed that means man just just give me all the worlds you can give me I can't control myself cuz that's what a does a can't can't keep their self all right everybody with me but God said they have a horse forehead from an unused root word meaning to be clear or conspicuous which is the brow or the forehead so so you've got unclean and then you've got what you it's at the Forefront some of us have real prominent foreheads May Brook collie some of y'all but you you see that though though I can look back here and I see your forehead so what's happening in the in the religious realm a horse forehead is is something that's being shown that they don't care whether they show it or not that's why that this is the ungodly group we are The Godly group because we don't have a horse forehead we are we are keeping ourself in the word of God we are not one time we are not uh highly fed except for the word of God we're not highly fed in the world so this is a this is a um a definition brother R doesn't say anything about horse forehead I think he makes a comment about it one time or reads it one time but this is used in the Bible as an analogy for a person or a group now if if this doesn't cover the Church of the day I don't know what it does or church who has broken all meaning of integrity now the church has broken all meaning of integrity so severely they no longer recognize the damage of the evil of their actions women come come to church with their haircut they come to church with pants on they just come to church anyway you know what I mean the big thing is come as you are I believe that but if you come as you are you won't go away as you came if you really get something you will not go away as you came if you get something I can agree with that come as you are come on Cindy came sister came for two or three months and then nobody had to blast her over the head about it she quit wearing earrings she quit wearing makeup just quit wearing pants dad just sat there and preached the word of God and just remind them that it's in the Bible and you remind you know all this all these things and you let them do it their own self that's better than having to be a slave to do it all right it is a relevant term today describing how the average person's sense of right or wrong has been warped from its natural we not living in that world shooting on every hand transgender I I I love this guy I is like it's not back but it's something else they were challenging him a transgender was challenging him on something about male and female he said I just want to ask one question he said how many of you that was born a man have ever give birth can't happen won't happen won't ever happen so that person you know goes off on this piece and answer my question how how many men in the Dawn and history of time he said all the way from recorded history how many people that were born men all right has had a baby well well none well okay then we know there's a separation between a male and a female hello somebody I mean see look but to the world it's become now the natural thing to to be whatever you want to be not here we have godliness now they're bringing it into churches the Methodist Church allowing every bit of that parts of the Methodist church thank God there's a part of the church that standing up says no our neighbor he said I'm not listening to a gay woman tell me about God Is it okay cuz he's a Methodist but you see how that see we don't debate that here that's never a debate we don't debate cloes we don't debate hey we don't debate whether it's father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ do we we don't debate those things in here we don't debate the Trinity there's no debate great is the mystery of godliness because he come into me and you and told us how to live what the bible really says or in other words what it means me straight from the mind of God people in the world they got their own War sense this is led to destruction of marriage massive numbers of fatherless homes and bastard births I'm sorry it is nothing now for a woman to get pregnant out of wedlock it's nothing it's just wide open do whatever sorry 30% to Upward of 80% illegitimacy rate in groups now in the Old Testament if you were born a bastard child you didn't you and your family you and whoever it was didn't go into congregation for 400 years right 400 years you were barred from going to church wow and we know that listen we've done been through this so the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of that now I don't care if you was born and you don't even know who your mom and daddy is it's your choice whether you get the new birth or not it's your choice whether you whether you uh let that bother you or not sure we let it bother us I know that cuz humanly it bothers us but but you're not going to hear from this pull pit and from the pull pit of the message of the hour that you're going to hell because you're a Bast child and you can't come in the congregation no the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse if you'll do it the right way amen don't come in with greasy Grace though and keep doing have four kids and well I'm under grace where's the husband I well all four of them gone well that's not that's greasy Grace don't do that open and increase sexual perversion homosexuality pedophilia transvestites beastality pornography adultery prostitution and the sexualization of young children especially girls have we not seen that that's a horse forehead that's that's become accepted practice now when I was growing up it wasn't if a girl got pregnant when I was growing up she disappeared for a little while anybody with me am now who's the daddy I don't know these passages all have a similar context they were written just prior to the fall and scattering of either Israel to the North or Judah to the South each shows a wealthy people unblinkingly focused on their pleasure is that not the United States of stinking America giving no thought to God listen we raised the debt ceiling just so we can stay in debt how's that fit brother John how's that fit we raised the debt ceiling so we can borrow more our credit card went to 70 trillion instead of 40 trillion there's got to be a day that that's going to fall but they unblinkingly focus on Pleasure giving no thought to God they're casually uninterested in the moral W welfare of their nation that is crashing into utter depravity shame for sin has disappeared the interpreter's commentary of the Bible states that the Bible shows that in the period before Nations fa their society show significant breakdowns in two areas political and business hello somebody and in family life with specific blame falling on women churches women are churches brother Brown said the weakness is what pullet he said uh not it's not uh children or juvenile delinquency it's what parental delinquency and these passages the following characteristics are either directly named or strongly implied Rebellion obstinacy betrayal distrust shamelessness and greed now I hope we don't have that problem here an audacious self-centeredness against God and fellow man we're going to talk about selfishness this afternoon these are not the characteristics of a nation that would bring honor to God at one time in the history of this nation the overwhelming majority of people expressed a strong sense of Shame when they sinned sin was an ugly thing and due to these senses of Shame they did whatever they could to hide their moral flaws from others but today the horse forehead is all painted right here look at me some of that still exists the period of late 1950s and 60s was probably the beginning of the end of that attitude sin has gradually carried less of a stigma and a sense of Shame has been slowly replaced by a growing boldness of attitude a flaunting of sin much of that sense of Shame has disappeared from the American psyche some remains in a small percentage of the population thank God that's why we live in Godly Godly territory but we'll suffer persecution because if we stand here against that they're going to persecute ask yet increasingly bold immorality has become the way of life so that sin is now blatantly committed civility is becoming a thing of the past rudess and open Brazen misconduct is becoming the normal way of doing things if this is not the world come on that's what the conduct of a horse forehead pictures it represents the blatant audacious sin of the street walker who is out in public openly displaying what she is promoting herself and tempting others to engage in sin with her wow they've had enough of that let's talk about godliness for a second I had enough of that so here's that group over here and listen folks you may think that's that that's you know we say we got the the world that don't care about God we got the world that thinks a little bit about God the world that goes to church under their denomination denominational idea and then you got the bride well every bit of that is from us down that's from us down I'm saying us too because we let a lot of stuff creep in used to not creep in churches in the message either oh don't say now brother way now you did good till you put us in that in that room yeah well you just look around there a lot of things goes on in the church that and there others not just this one that that you know 40 years ago wouldn't happen quiet CU it's right you know it you see it you look around a deity is a supernatural the shaping of Western Christianity well let's get to deity for just a second and then we'll close it was coined by St Augustine a theologian whose writings were very influential in the shaping of Western Christianity deity comes from the Latin word for God D the divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal goodness and powerfulness or any supernatural being brother R tells this right here and he swore by himself 1954 he said let's just read the red in it the same life that was in the corn down here at the first talk is in it up here in the ear the grain just the same the same God was in the pillar of fire was in Christ Jesus all right hold on the same one in Christ Jesus in you that's what right God in you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God no wonder he believes in the Supernatural no wonder he believes in anything why is it in him is a portion of god wow wrapped up in that mortal body where there sin and everything else has created this body but down in there some work of God alone and regeneration ation somehow he come down through all that mess and saved your soul has come down through there by the shedding of his own blood taking away that blood that was in there as a way and set it aside and entered into this sinful man and put him in a hope that he'd die for it just as freely as he'd stand there now what he saying in in simple terms you still got your old stinking blood cuz you were born in sin shaping you came from your dad's sperm and your mama will give you the body right everybody with me and that's inside of you and that that you know the song his royal blood flows through my veins is not happening right now but by what representation of his blood like brother R talks about a blood transfusion but he said right here see I like what he said and set it aside he shed his own blood and taken away that blood that was in there not taking your blood all the way out but as a way and set it aside and entered into this sinful man and put him in a hope that he'd die let's stand to our feet we'll stop right there we'll finish this afternoon we didn't even get to Godliness much musicians come let's sing a song but we got to believe that we're not just another part of God in another situation or another separation we are God made manifest in another form called a bride right so right here brother R said he's just a portion of God now remember we're not all of God Jesus Christ was all of God we're not all of God we're we're part of God but you know what a part of God is all of God you take the spoon go dip it in the ocean come out put it under a microscope you look then you take the microscope if you could and go out and the four fifths of the of the
