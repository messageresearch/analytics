thanksgiving and then november the 23rd will be on tuesday we'll be having service on that tuesday not wednesday before thanksgiving wow it's already thanksgiving almost so anyway all right so let's turn to john 1 1 and continue our thought um i'm kind of enjoying it too we're not even really got into the meat of it yet we're just kind of trying to explain who the son of man is but we got to get into the characteristics of it and then we got to bring it home we got to bring it to us we give it a little bit but you we got to bring it into where the son of man the son of man becomes evident in the bride and the evidence will be there amen i'm looking for signs and wonders i mean you're not you know you're not supposed to be built on signs and wonders but i'm telling you if when the son of man fully hits the earth what happened when the son of man fully hit the earth 2 000 years ago there were signs and wonders amen and brother brown said it pop like popcorn god will anoint a church then well i believe that's when that church realizes who she is that she's she still is the son of god you still listen that's your new birth don't ever throw that out and say well we don't need to know you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater all right you've still got the son of god's what's inside of you that's what was inside jesus that was a that's why they said you're the creator they knew there was something different but they couldn't understand that and that flesh being god so that's the whole thing and that same thing with me and you they won't mind us talking about first one thing in another about how good our church is and how good people cook squash casserole but when you start talking about and you get it down to what jesus was talking about i am the resurrection in life if you don't believe in me you're dead now buddy that's when they left the house now that was the son of man talking though we're going to get over that a little bit further where the son of man stood one day and he said the son of man can forgive sins on earth how do you think brother branham in his first part of his ministry he couldn't give a grace of marriage and divorce we'll look at just a minute how we got to progress up to it because moses had to progress to a place to where god could show him his form and i'll read in the bible where god told moses okay moses you've got to this place i'll honor it now i'll show you who i am and that's the same way with me and you that we got to come to a place where god will honor and come on the scene and we and that see that entails adoption and all the the great things that we that we already know but we need to go over again so just keep us in your prayers john 1 verse 1 to heavenly father we pray lord that you'll be with us today lord sanctify us for this journey forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord we truly know that we're sinners saved by grace but this thing that's inside of us called the holy ghost is perfect and that's what you're looking to lord you're looking to that part of us but now i pray that that part of us will work its way out lord and that we will become better christians we will as you did lord learn by the things you suffer that will become lord you made manifest in another form called the bride father lord give us our daily bread be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick touch us all in body and spirit father in jesus name we pray amen all right in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now see he's talking about the son of god because we just read this morning what was the son of god the logos the one that came out and said let there be so that's what he's talking about now but he's gonna he's gonna work his way all the way down to verse 14 and that's the son of man because that word's got to be made flesh amen prophet god said one time we'll read it later on word becoming flesh flesh becoming word amen you got to get it all together all right as brother donnie's we were talking about hebrews a body that has prepared me and that's exactly what it is it's a body thou hast prepared me and him was life and life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness to the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of the light you know remember john wasn't born again not a baptist no least in the kingdom's greater than john what's the kingdom the baptism of the holy ghost the least and the king that's why he couldn't be that light he was there to show the light and to say hey turn and look this is where the light is i'm not the light now we know it was a great prophet we know he's going to heaven but he was not bribed amen if he had been bribed he wasn't asked three months later after they put him in prison for his disciples to go back and said are you the one that's supposed to come or do we need to seek another one the prophet of god said his eagle eye got filmed over well he didn't have the holy ghost to tell him any different or he would he wouldn't ask that question there wasn't something there you know there was not something there so he wasn't the light but he was sent to bear witness of that light see that's the difference in me and you you and i are going to become that true light that was that true light now that light true light is where it's inside of you today he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man nicodemus but of god that's what nicodemus went back to he said i gotta go get back in my mother's womb he put it all toward flesh nothing to the spirit all right but jesus said no you've got to be born from above that first verse what's killing you nicodemus which were born out of blood nor the will of the flesh not all the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh now back up there in verse 1 in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god so this god this word is going to become flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and by the baptism of the holy ghost the word was made flesh in you amen you may be seated lord has blessings to the reading of the word because remember as we were talking this morning we came flesh first fall in condition we came by sex should not have come that way but there was a part of god that was not born from a mom and a daddy there's a part of god that he created genesis 1 26 let us make man in our own image he's the only one that can do that amen amen he was born of a woman job said is what shorter days and full of trouble so that's our problem we were born from a woman if we start if we're born again we're born from a man amen amen we're born from a man when you get born again you get the person of jesus christ not a woman now you become the bride but remember i thought they were one i thought adam and eve were one when they come together they were one they were actually one flesh the same will week but remember the son of man came word first and the beginning was the word where was with god that's why jesus could stand and say before abraham was i am he could tell him all these things because he was the word first then that word became flesh and dwelt among us see that's the difference like i said before in the son of man and a son of man a son a son of man is born of sex then comes into the body of christ by the baptism of the holy ghost the son of man behold a virgin shall conceive isaiah said behold the virgin shall conceive now that is the son of man so you and i can't be the son of man in a in one body so william branham could not be the son of man in one body because he was born of of of charleston ella branham amen but when he was born from above that put him in a whole another category amen all right so now we were looking here at genesis 3 15 and i'll put enmity this is to me this is one of the greatest scriptures because it's it's telling the story whole story even of the old testament and the new testament now you got to read between the lines and put in all the bulls and goats and all the moses and all the isaiah's and then you got to put in the john the baptist and all the major prophets that come down because he i will put image where is that eye that eye is god himself that eye is god himself that worked through and we'll read later on today about ezekiel son of man prophesy son of man prophesy and if you'll watch and read your bible look in ezekiel sometimes it'll say son of man prophesy now i know that the the s is in the first of the sentence but if you'll look in a few places you'll look over in the in the sentence and the s will be a capital s right where it shouldn't be well that's the son of man talking then you see the little s which is god talking to ezekiel he's you'll we'll see in just a minute maybe we'll bring that out it's really it's really beautiful to watch you say well how in the world that bob was covering it today the lord said unto my lord capital l was talking to the little l what the capital l is always hey when you get when god starts talking to you by the baptism of the holy ghost it's the big l talking to the little l amen i thought that was just one position now it's a position because see brother louise doesn't have all the holy ghost because you've got the holy ghost and you've got the holy ghost jesus christ had all the holy ghost god is the holy ghost all right so we bring this out because this to me it's like i said before it puts everything in perspective that we have got to come to a woman see this was spoken before isaiah said a virgin shall conceive but he was a he was he put enmity or division and that's what we're going to talk about a little bit um because there was a little bit of um i felt a little pushback when i we were talking about uh that they had just a little bit of light during the church ages so we'll talk about that i kind of want to go through that a little bit more um sometimes you feel you feel like man it's all good and the water just flows really good and then all of a sudden something dams it up so this morning i kind of felt that maybe there was a little bit something i need to cover again so we'll go back and cover that all right listen not belittling anyone god didn't belittle anybody when he said i'm going to put enmity between them and what he's given you he's telling you the whole story remember what brother brown said the acts of a play he's acting out what he's going to do this great eternal plan of redemption has got to include if it's redemption that means we have to fall pretty simple we had to fall if there was redemption so in that there is a fall that we've already fell but god said in other words i'm going to put a division but i'm going to put it back together by this her seed which is christ amen woman i wrote myself a note woman to flesh because flesh has got to come back flesh is how they fell adam and eve did not fall in their soul they fell in their flesh their their spiritual being memory reason conscious affection and then their body just took over and did what the spirit told us to do amen and that what happens to us don't when we repent when we repent listen when we repent as as christians your soul doesn't repent your soul is god your spirit is what's repenting you're repenting for the memory reason conscious effects of imagination but if you're born again how can you repent if you repent that means your soul sinned and i thought your soul can't sin by the baptism of the holy ghost your soul cannot sin that's why you can't be judged when you're born again you can't be judged you're already judged amen what a wonderful picture so the woman is going to bring forth a child it's going to be a flesh person and it shall bruise thy head so it's talking about a body and thou shalt bruise his heel all right so the speaking of a promised son even before a virgin shall conceive god said i'm going to have to come down in human flesh and fix this thing because you take it all through types ruth boaz it had to be flesh can right can folk had to be flesh for the redemption to happen ruth had to be or boaz had to be kind to naomi and then ruth came under that being me and you as a gentile we've been through that a long time so deuteronomy 18 15 lord thy god will raise up to be a prophet from the midst of thee this is talking about the son of man again like unto me unto him you shall hearken so there's moses telling us that god is going to have to come down in human flesh as a prophet not a prophet but the prophet amen because brother branham even tells us that who was the prophet of the end time he said the lord jesus christ is the prophet of the end time amen he he used william branham's voice many many thousands and hundreds of thousands of time but william mary and brethren can't heal you he can't even give you a revelation only god can give you a revelation but he used a vessel that we giving signs and wonders that we can look and see all the different signs in his life and we can see that god had to work through that man i don't see how people can't see that god didn't work through that man and they call him a deceiver and everything else but listen they called god almighty a deceiver when jesus was on earth they called him everything in the world beelzebub deceiver and all these other things because he didn't come the normal way brother branham didn't come the normal way you know it's okay to quote moody and calvin and sankey and the different ones you know they'll they're they're people are pretty calm when you quote them or james dobson or or uh or jensen franklin they see how calm this is they go oh yeah okay that's just uh max lucado and you got all these good guys then you say brother branham said and they go what who is this man what's he telling me what to do you know why because he wasn't anyone now he went into normal he was he came here to what to give us the true word of god all the others are okay but he came for god to speak through him and he yielded himself we were talking about downstairs sister cleta was actually in that meeting i was talking about where they divided up the auditorium when he preached marriage in divorce and who is this melchizedek the night after that so all right let's go to matthew 16 and let's read real quick when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man i am this is where you i get all this everything is built around this because look what they said i'm going to try to word this right some say thou art john the baptist some say this in other words you know if you've got brother branham or samuel dale or whoever that's a a pillar of the of the the you know donnie reagan the different ones and he asked a question and they said well some of you say you got this doctrine and somebody said you got this and then you follow this guy and you follow this person and he stops he says no who do you say i am who do you say that's what god's asking you today are you following john the baptist i hope not john the baptist introduced christ he's not in the laodicean church age amen who you follow james dobson well james dobson is not a prophet he might be a good guy and he does have some good things to say but he's not somebody that can divide the word because all those people i uh that i mentioned they were all trinitarians they all believed in you know denominations so that's why i said what brother brown said you got to start thinking a new way even when you come to the lord in this message by the baptism of the holy ghost the son of god revelation it is a different revelation than what they get out there amen but then we got to take that and go further than that because nobody teaches i don't say nobody in the message i'm just saying you don't hear this in denominations they really all they do with the statue of perfect manners is you ain't perfect now ain't perfect talk to them every once in a while and you nail it down first thing they say i ain't perfect and you ain't perfect you don't need to be cutting your hair and wearing shorts and you know you start listing off the things you shouldn't do there well you ain't perfect i ain't perfect you know what they're telling you i ain't perfect so i can continue to do that and god's going to allow me to do that that ain't happening that's not my revelation that's not your revelation that may be their revelation but it's not our revelation and that revelation will not take you to the son of man revelation amen we're trying to get this is the vehicle that's going to take us from the son of god revelation to the son of man revelation you got to have the son of god first you got to have the baptism of the holy ghost seek it every day of your life i was up late late last night and that was one of the things i said god don't let me be that person that comes to you and says have i not cast out devils preach the gospel and he said depart from me i never knew you what a horrible thing that you've spent a lot of people have spent most of their lives trying to do that and they've been deceived right amen don't god don't let me be the savior amen god don't let me be deceived so he saith unto them but who say ye that i am i'm asking you today that's our question who is thou i am he says but whom say ye that i am and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god basically he was saying you're the creator you're the son of god your god made manifest down here on earth and that's what's inside of you but i cannot understand how that all goes together that's pretty much what he was saying because if he'd have known and put it together he'd never run away from jesus at the at the cross he'd knew when jesus said because look at all the times and we'll get into it because i was reading it yesterday before yesterday in the gospels he told them he said i'm going to die i'm going to give my life in the hands of these people i'm going to be in the grave for three days the third day i'm going to raise from the dead he laid the plan out for him and they didn't believe one word he said not one destroy this temple i'll raise them in three days oh he's gonna knock that temple down that temple was probably as big as the taj mahal and he said he gonna knock that thing down and build it back in three days they never understood what a depressing thing maybe that jesus i wonder why he said sometimes maybe in and and and thought i'm lonely nobody knows it's like brother branham in the sixth cell he's standing there at the pulpit as lonely as can be when he said it's gone from you it's not for you go on and live a simple christian life in other words you're not gonna get what i'm saying but it won't return void somebody's gonna get it so jesus was there and jesus why swine john 17 he prayed for me and you even though we were still locked up inside of him and we had no genealogy out here in the world 2 000 years ago right he was praying for me and you when we got here amen thou art the christ the son of the living god i was going to be short today but i don't think so i don't think i decided not to be and jesus answered blessed art thou simon barjona where flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it i give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven you see that you look at that and you see peter didn't understand what he had till the day of pentecost or he could have turned that key several times in his life but he didn't he didn't have it he was giving him the keys but it wasn't right then it was potentially he said but i know jesus was going now peter when you get the holy ghost you're not you're going to know where that key is at and you're going to know how to use it right now you're not going to know because all peter wanted to do was fight people and cut their ears off and and stab somebody you know he wanted lord you will never deny you yeah right yeah right peter yeah he said but i prayed for you peter he said i saw satan sift you like sand he said but i prayed for you now don't you think john 17 he did the same thing for me and you he prayed for us that we would make it and we're going to make it he prayed for us that we're going to make it and we are going to make it and upon this rock i'll build my church so 2 000 years he built his church on revelation of the son of man tell them god and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give thee the keys of the kingdom now we read that number one on thirst the prophet of god tells us to know him as life the person christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that god built his church upon and if we don't build upon that same church the bible says abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right you know brother brown said one time he said what did they say brother brown what is the new birth he said it's a personal revelation of jesus christ personally to you so that's what this is right here it's the person faith is the divine revelation this whole thing is built on the revelation then and unless it's revealed to you jesus said i thank the father that now has hid these things from the wise or the view of the wise of this world and revealed it to babe such as we'll learn see the whole thing is built you've got to know the person and who is that person the son of man now you got to know the son of god we know that but you got to move it up now this is the one i want to stop don't get much further that's okay it's just kind of background but i wanted to get to ezekiel but let's go to number two what visions are and this is where brother brown's talking now what's he doing he's telling us this is in 1956 he hasn't had the seals revealed to him yet he knows maybe that something's coming he know as a prophet he sees things going to transpire he knows though that his you think you take all the quotes from brother brown said not in the years of preparation or not when he starts his message somebody's self not in the healing campaign i believe it's in choosing of a bride he said but when he comes to start his message so this is what he's talking about here now watch now when the holy spirit fell on the church it was an eastern people in jerusalem that's where the holy ghost fell and great signs and wonders was done by the church in the early pentecostal age of the early church then the next round of apostles then came into catholic church then 1500 years then the lutherans then from all that down it's been a day where the light went out and it's been a daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god and you should repent but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages now stop right there i was trying to this is the only thing i can come up with that'll help us is number one in the early church ages the bible was not written the bible's not written until the age of man which is lutheran and wesley right so all they had was the resources they had was maybe somebody wrote something down maybe somebody listen if you went and heard somebody preach like paul or peter you just had to get it by wrote recall you had to bring it up in your brain you couldn't say well now if you'll go over there and listen to that tape see how we yeah now what'd he say because remember paul was so misunderstood there was a group that was preaching that paul was preaching that the resurrection had already happened right phillips and harmonious i believe it was and they tried to get him to stop and they wouldn't stop and you know the lord did what he did but it's because they didn't have resources but see god knew that that's the plan of god because here's the program the program is the same holy ghost but remember there's four characteristics of the holy ghost the lion the ox the man and the eagle and see that's in ezekiel so that sets the pattern that you couldn't have a man age in the first church age it's not rick it's not required it was the boldness of a line speak the word of god do the things of god be like cyrenthius uh strength it was the strength yeah in the bath house saying i'm not gonna have anything to do with or the iranians say i'm not gonna have anything to do with ceremonies because syrenthia said that jesus wasn't god right so the boldness of a lion the bible was not even written the resources were not there but the line then you had the ox he said the 1500 years of of well that's tribulation the catholic church what they do they just shut the light off they said you don't believe in me if we had the if we had the church ages up here remember that fourth church age is about the same as our church age just a little bit of life amen because of 1500 years of dark ages and they didn't have they didn't have enough word i mean even even columba was a messenger of that age and he died before the age started so it had to be what the preachers preached do you understand you see how difficult listen it's difficult for y'all to even to listen to a sermon and you can press play anytime you want to hard for us to read a book we got them right here in front of us sometimes it's hard for us to read the bible and there's bibles on every bookshelf but for them it just wasn't there there was no resources but you know what god honored it because god said that's my people they are under the messenger of their hour and they're doing what he said the best of their ability so now watch brother branham saying then from then on down it's been a day where the light went out and it's been a daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god you should repent but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages certainly the bible said it wouldn't as the prophet said it wouldn't just as sure as he said they couldn't believe because isaiah said there hasn't been light because the prophet said there's been enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection of the lord jesus accept him as your personal savior put your name on the church book and live the good life all right i read that this morning that that's that's the son of god revelation that's what god said jesus said look i'm gonna make it real simple this is how i'm gonna build my church now i'm going to have a group of people that i'm going to build on more because remember zerubbabel had to come and clean everything off and build a pyramid amen he had to clean that off to build a pyramid which the pyramid is the stature of a perfect man they didn't have the statue of a perfect man back then like i said the bible wasn't written till the 1500s somewhere in there so they didn't have a they didn't have a bible to read they didn't read what peter wrote maybe somebody got a hold of the bible and would read it but it was second-hand information they could change it i wonder why all the you know you wonder the the catholic church why they were so powerful there was nothing for them they held the latin vulgate they held everything that was that was of history so they just said now we don't need to do it you just listen to what the priest said yeah we're going to have a father son holy ghost baptism yeah i know they i know they didn't baptize that way in the early church but we're going to do it this way now see there was nothing to combat that and god had to literally wink at their ignorance he had to wink because there's a lot of people even luther was a trinitarian wesley was trinitarian the first church the pentecostal church of 1906's through the street they were trinitarians but god winked at their ignorance look knowing that somebody was coming amen that's us that would know the full word of god that would not be just a small light it would be a full manifestation of the holy ghost you say well i don't know i just i just like being a child of god well that's okay that's all right that's what you want to be you can stop yourself anytime you want to because you're a free mortal agent and you can do it but you know what i don't want to taste death i may have to but i sure don't want to because god promised me there was somebody that wouldn't boy what a but listen what a great thing you say well that ought to make you feel good well no it ought to make you real humble that god could bring you something that as we were singing about the saints you realize they're waiting on you and me a group of people that's going to see the son of man revelation and it's going to be so strong it's going to be like lazarus come forth but we're not going to just call one person now it's going to be a whole seven church ages are going to be called out of the ground and you know what it's not going to take a lot of effort it's just going to be in it to right being at the right place in the right position and listen having the resources we have the resources now to study more than anybody's ever studied before we can take words and run them all the way back into the wherever they didn't have that that's right we have that now where we can study as ministers and you can study as laity and we can put these things together and the holy ghost can really work i i believe brother brown said you know you wait he said this is just in part brother branham was just in part because it was one man but when you get a worldwide church full of people now look it's not going to be billions it's probably not even going to be millions but it's going to be a small group that's going to be connected together by the holy ghost not by the internet but by the holy coast we're going to be connected together and we're going to bring the dead saints out of the ground i just believe that 100 because that's what the bible said it's the same holy ghost but they didn't have much to work in back then so not belittling those people because you got to include paul and paul wrote 80 of the new testament so you can't belittle those people but they had their time i i was thinking in there a few minutes ago that's why the bible says the last will be first and the first will be last why we got more revelation than they do the last church age the last church aged messenger the last bride has got more revelation than the first church age so the last us will come up first then the first is going to come up last that's just the way that's the way the bible says it amen now we can skip over let's go to the next one says son of god is who we know he's the creator he's the one that steps out and says let there be he's the one that started all this amen and as he started it he's going to finish it he couldn't be the son of man back then because like i said before eve's womb was already polluted her brain womb up here was already polluted and then her natural wound got polluted and god said i'll not dwell in an unclean vessel i'm not gonna come through something unclean but i'll put enmity and then a virgin shall conceive and i'm going to come in i'm going to come away where nobody has ever come this way before nobody nobody's ever been born like this and that's the way i'm going to be born because i'm going to clean that womb out i'm going to clean the womb i'm going to clean the people up i'm going to come back i'm going to come into the people i'm going to keep them clean and i'm going to come back again in the end time and i'm going to really clean them up i'm going to clean the body up which to me is totally a miracle as much as we the flesh gets beaten listen i'mma live in this flesh for an eternity not like you see it but i'm going to live in this flesh i'm so connected to god he was so connected to me he put mom and dad together and brought the right flesh here for my soul to fit in amen he did that brother bryan said he didn't what he he bred this one to this one this one to this one how many stories did you hear of how y'all got together or how your mama got together or how your daddy was in the war and everybody got killed but him why if you're predestinated it's because of you you're the one that kept them from dying because if they die you're done that's what i told them we were in virginia i was preaching for brother um ron spencer and i told him i said you know the civil war up here happened a lot i said there were 600 000 men got killed in the civil war now that was during the whole part of the war six hundred thousand men so that's six hundred thousand generations because when you die you don't unless they had already had children or started having children a lot of them are really young i said do you know you living here in virginia i said you know it's a miracle you got here because most of those people died were from virginia and different places like that i said it was a miracle how that your daddy made it through the civil war and then here come you why it was god it was those angels flicking the bullets out of the way or turning you in a direction to where that you can't be harmed thank god that he thought enough of you to do that he thought enough to get your flesh here he already had your soul and knew what you were gonna do and he brought you down here in human flesh that's why i love that genesis 1 26 man it didn't stay in spirit form it was put in flesh god was happy when he put it in flesh he knew they were going to fall but he was still happy and he was happy when you came born in sin shaping in iniquity spousal your mother's womb a liar doomed it on your way to hell god said hang on devil just give him a minute just give him a few years don't worry you you can give him all kind of trouble but he's just like job he said but you can't touch your soul you can't kill him you can give him all kind of problems you want to but you just don't touch his soul he said because that one's mine and he's got to come or she's got to come to this place right here now devil you don't know it because you're not in my mind but he said okay you can you can do what you need to do but you just you can't take their life you see how much god is working to get you here this may not be part of the sermon but this is part of the son of man if we're gonna be the part of the son of man to play we gotta be alive we gotta be here and we gotta believe who we are so after the fall let's skip on through we know about genesis 1 26. let's go to genesis 6 verse 8 after the fall there was no way for man to fellowship with god this is what was formed was genesis 1 26 then he put to 126 and the 2 7 man and was supposed to start bringing children by the spoken word of god we know that didn't happen all right so keep going to the next one genesis 3 15 then genesis 6 verse 8. so after the fall there was no way for man to fellowship with god the way he wanted them to fellowship i picked up my favorite book two nights ago oneness with god 1962 february read it boy i'm telling you he said there was god and adam and eve in the garden talking he said true oneness now that's three people that's three people he said true oneness was god talking to adam and eve in the cool of the day that's true oneness because listen true oneness is is all of us millions that's going to be living in that new city that's true oneness listen when the world that lives outside that makes it by the skin of their teeth and they're living outside the city and they see all of us living inside the city they're gonna go those people are jesus christ made manifest in another form called the bride they're gonna know who you are they're gonna know and give you honor we made it but there was no way for man to fellowship with god so god had to allow the bulls and ghosts like brad was talking about today there had to be a holy of holies and there had to be a a a law given and there had to be this and there had to be that given all down to the church ages i mean well church ages in the old testament the bible says noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so luke 17 verse 26 says as it was in the days of noah because remember it says it was also in the days of the son of man not when the son of man is revealed but in the days of the son of man you have to get on down to where genesis 18 3. we're going to skip through this real quick genesis 18 3 he said my lord now i want to read you a quote they don't have it there it's off of who is this melchizedek y'all ought to read that one too how many times have i told you i want to read three or four songs whatever you need to re read a book read a book this week okay everybody gets the book of the month club and you start reading the book so hello your book of the month club is who is this milk is it read the book and oneness with god it's not publisher clearinghouse either aaron y'all have my own book club all right read this book but who is this melchizedek now look we're talking about now we've up to abraham real quick here now god in this stage it's this stage of his creation later formed in the flesh jesus let's talk about who's this melchizedek because remember melchizedek was not jesus christ the flesh melchizedek was not your savior in the form he was in when he he was only a prophet to prophesy to abraham to tell him according to the time of life but now remember he had to be almighty god because he had to change sarah's womb and change them back to young people now a normal human being can't do that it had to be god so from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be well you don't oh you got hey good job from the great spirit beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in morphe later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes what are me and you we're the attributes of god so he's talking to me and you all right when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing then he starts talking about ruth and boaz but what is it what did they do they met god in human flesh and he changed their body and now what we're looking at we're looking to a body change all right so every son of the faith in the final end we'll do the same thing we got to come we got to be able to identify this lord not three but one see how important that is that brother brown brought the revelation of one god we wouldn't be able to fulfill that if we he didn't bring us back to the revelation of one true and living god amen because abraham is the father of our faith and we have faith in that there's one god i don't have faith that there's three i got faith that there's one god and listen he lives in your heart he's not he's not the third person of the trinity doesn't live in your soul father son holy ghost okay no no all three of them live in your soul amen the three manifestations of one god lives in your soul all right then my lord means of men i want to try to skip through all this because i want to get something here to end and remember that that was the the definition of lord is adonai which means of men are the title spoken in place of yahweh in jewish display of reverence that's why brother brown said when he called him lord he knew who he was same way with paul paul said lord he was doing the same thing he was calling him the same thing when he said lord all right so let's continue on genesis 18 verse 22 and the men turned their face from them and went towards sodom we talked about that this morning but abraham stood yet before the lord so what happened billy graham and oral robbers went to the world and they blinded the eyes of the people brought some people in listen let me say one more time he didn't send billy graham and oral roberts just to blind people and and not get any fruit for their labor they're identified in the scripture as the two prophets that went to sodom i'm just telling you what brother brown said and he said they had the holy ghost well see why you say well and i've had people ask me said well why didn't they accept the message it wasn't theirs to accept they had their own message if they had a message and the prophet identified where they were going sure i believe billy graham and oral robbers there'll be people under their message that receives the holy ghost under their message believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved all right everybody got that i'm just not i don't want to kick people out i'd rather put people in i don't i don't want to kick you know sodom and gomorrah didn't make it but at least three of them did i mean three people came out of sodom and gomorrah at least those three people come out and believe the message of their hour that was the lukewarm church the one we talked about this morning the center of the lukewarm church and the elect now the elect stayed right here the elect stayed with what the son of man revelation amen because listen abraham didn't know that was god in human flesh if he called him my lord and he looked at him and fed him a calf and give him butter and give him let him sit down in the chair washed his feet he knew that was a man but he knew that god was in that man he might not understood totally but he knew my lord you've come to visit me have we had a visitation you got to have a visitation in your life you may not have to be on the plains of memory and you know may not have to be here and there but you need to have a visitation from god that you know that you know that back side of the desert experience that brother brown was talking about he said oh brother wait that's just for preachers i know i think it's for everybody i think it's for everybody we all ought to have a backside of the desert experience where we meet god and we won't see him in a burning bush we'll see him as a person a man because he is a person all right so genesis 19 verse 1 the two angels go to sodom they bring lot out he says my lords but luke 17 28-30 is what brother branham always keys in on where it comes to lot where right before the destruction of the world or sodom this is what's got to happen likewise as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they know what's happening now they planted they build it it's not too you can't buy much now supply chains if y'all want anything for christmas you better buy it now there's several thousand boats sitting out there in the ocean with products on it that i talked to a guy this morning he ordered some bee equipment and be here in three to six months three to six months so i'm just saying we may have to pray a little bit before we get out of this place this may be our persecution coming where we can't find stuff amen and it's not stuff we want listen god ain't in your wants he's in your needs ain't in your wants amen let's just pray that all the equipment comes for this stuff richard roberts we're having a hard time getting you know we've already got the screens up here for our to put our we can get rid of this thing and we're going to put them right here and put all the songs on it but it's and they're they're undertaking i looked at that thing y'all were doing you and anderson good grief the schematics oh thank god y'all doing it if it was color coded i couldn't do it but pray for them that we'll get the equipment and we'll get them in here because they're gonna have to run all new wires all these cameras are outdated i didn't know if you knew that or not all these cameras now are outdated we're going to high definition something something something where we gotta have to make sure dad we're gonna have to make sure um hair's right everybody be able to see every hair on your head mine may be three or four but that's okay but listen remember that's what's happened in sodom before the destruction came but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man listen when the son of man is revealed it's going to be just a very short work and we're going to be out of here and god's going to rain down fire on sodom and gomorrah natural here on this earth amen i mean it's just going to be a real short time there's not going to be a church age or not going to be years no i believe it's going to happen boom boom boom and it may happen as soon as we get out of here amen but even though shall it be in the day when the son of man look is revealed not just shows up but revealed we know who he is we know where he's at and we know why he's here amen that's our that's our situation that we are not fully taking and saying well it's like the brother said this weekend well we know the son of man people was preached on the son of man and preached on the son of man we know that we're under the see people know that we're under the ministry of the son of man listen if you don't have the revelation of it you're not not trying to be mean but if you're not under that and you don't like he said i i couldn't i couldn't separate him and know why the sort of man had to come and so they just put him on a shelf i believe the message so i must believe it's not a man no no no revealed revealed it's got to be revealed it's something that's got to be made listen to reveal something is what you didn't know it to begin with what is a mystery something previously hidden amen and i believe revelation 10 7 says at the sounding of the seventh church age messenger when the mystery of god should be finished the whole message amen let's look let's look at this we all know let's go to moses we didn't read this this morning exodus 33 now watch many times moses has said god i'd like to see you god i'd like to see you now the bible says that moses spoke lip to ear to god that means moses said i mean god said moses this is what i want you to do not from somebody else moses this is what i want you to do but he never seen him i'm fixing that right here and the lord said unto moses now look i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken moses was a prophet moses was a major prophet but he had to come to a position before god showed himself to him that's what i'm talking about me and you you can't just say i'm in the message you can't just say i've been i've got tenure i mean really i better miss you 35 years i know the book numbers and i know the and i know the colors of the book some of y'all don't even know the books how to color i pulled one out and read it the other day at um in kentucky it was uh what was it oh um the anointed ones at the end time and i believe it was like a gray book and somebody said what is that i said that's a message book you ought to read them sometime it was one of the older books that was by color so and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing that thou has spoken look with a condition for thou hast found grace in my sight been with him a long time and i know the by name now wait a minute he called moses 80 years ago this was the exodus he called him a you know he called him at least 40 years ago in the burning bush and i know thee by name moses had come to a position to where god could show himself to him that's the same ain't going to happen to me in you and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory that was moses and god said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to who i am be gracious and show mercy on whom i will show mercy but there was a condition because moses was not a son of god he didn't have the holy ghost he had an anointing but he didn't have the holy ghost in his soul and he said thou can't see my face why why he'd seen jesus christ but he wouldn't have known who he was he wouldn't have known who he was because he didn't have the new birth so god's not going to show you something and you not know who he is you understand what i'm saying there's a position god just didn't just say look now that you've been in the message for 15 minutes i'm going to show you everything 20 minutes i'm going to show you this everything i'm just going to lay it out here no he's not going to do that because listen god is very specific and you can't just be frivolous and you can't just say well like i said i've i've been sitting in this church for 40 years i don't know what god is well you may not know no more about god than what brother brown said hot and taught knew about an egyptian knife whatever what is that do you remember google that neither have i i'm afraid to and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live now look when he became jesus christ everybody saw his face amen when he was born on earth as the son of man which he wasn't at the time right he's developed he's now jehovah he's the great lord god almighty he's the great one that was in the burning bush he was a great one that came to joshua he was a great one that does these different things but he said for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock because look son of man moses couldn't see the son of man he didn't have a revelation for the son of man see my face see my face because remember he saw what the back part of a man he didn't see his face he saw the back part the backside back here because his revelation couldn't show him the front but i thought the bible said me and you are to behold him face to face now what's the difference in moses and us we got the new birth we got a revelation we've come to a position but watch and thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by man thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passed by which is his theophany that i will put then a cleft of the rock now that is not cleft c-l-e-f-t is c-l-i-f-t all right we'll get into that maybe later on i don't want to deal with it today because we we we sometimes we quote it wrong it's not cleft it's cleft it's two different words of the rock not a rock either the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass you see what god did in luther's age he covered luther's eyes to the revelation of one true living god he covered wesley's eyes to the father son holy ghost baptism and allowed them to do that because it wasn't time for them to see him face to face it wasn't time for people to see him like they did 2000 years ago partial revelation he covered up their eyes and i will cover thee with my hand while i pass by and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see the back part because remember he's got he walked by and moses looked and saw a man saw the back part of a man but my face shall not be seen that's a revelation of the son of man that's to my that's me that's me because face is personal you don't know that person unless you look at them in the face and when you look at them in the face you get a revelation of who that person is man woman old young pretty not so pretty but it's by the face so that's what i see and i when i looked i said man i wrote myself a question i said why why couldn't moses see his face it wasn't time for him to be revealed that way but now it's time for him to be revealed amen now we don't we look through a glass darkly but now face to face all right let's go to let's skip on through to number four we know that he met joshua he met the captain of the host we talked about that this morning let's get to this one like we were this morning now look now notice he came first as a prophet they crucified him that's the son of man his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the holy spirit came he was then the son of god god is a spirit he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the church ages as the son of god now in the millennium he'll be son of david and real quick i want to throw this in for a couple of people that asked me a question about them why the millennium is not to us because it's not promised us gentiles are not promised a millennium bride is not promised a millennium because we're eternal a millennium is a thousand years we covered this you know several weeks ago in the in the eternal redemption so that's why the millennium is not to the bride we're there on a honeymoon we're just there like we're going to go and we've got reservations and we're going to go to this place for a thousand years because listen son of david has nothing to do with us remember the syrophoenician woman said thou son of david have mercy on me and said he didn't even pay her any attention you see what i mean about position there's position she said lord and he turned she said son of david brother brown said she had no possession in other words no nothing to deal with him she was a gentile and the son of david is to the jews thou son of david have mercy on me but now remember she was a gentile but now remember bartimaeus bartimaeus was a jew when he borrowed a mass when jesus walked by said thou son of david have mercy on me they said he turned and he said come here bring him here why because he was a jew so there you go the millennium is to the jews the millennium is not to the gentiles and that see to me that proves position i want you to start thinking about position it's not just that we got tenure that we've been in the message that we've heard brother now for 40 years it does help a lot it helps a lot but it's not just because of that we're not doing these things just because of we're doing it because we reach a position moses reached a position to god said okay i'll let you see me now in other words you wouldn't understand what i was back then but you understand me now see that's what i'm praying for that i'll understand the present god i think i've got the god that was back there 2000 years ago the son of god that came back on the day of pentecost i've i've got him in my soul amen by the new birth but i want that son of man to come to me because now we can receive him because we're in the time of receiving where is to be revealed now how's the son of man going to be revealed he's got to be revealed in flesh and he can't be revealed in his own flesh he walked 2 000 years ago he's only can be revealed in your flesh in my flesh just like i said this morning in the flesh of the church of the living god not that church out there but in the flesh of the bride god is going to reveal himself just for a moment we saw it in william branham just for a moment but he said what you saw in part you'll see in its fullness what is the fullness when everybody or most people get a revelation of the son of man will be an invincible army now in the millennium he'll be son of david sitting on the throne of his father david because what was david david was a jew he is the son of david and then that's not now he's not now the son of david everybody understand that he is the son of david comma now he's going to make a point now now remember between the son of god in the layout of sin church age they put him out he's knocking at the door and in luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures tie perfectly together it's on a man son of god son of david what is it it's the same god all the time just changing his form and morphing he changed it just a great drama to him he's acting it out now who's he acting it for he's not acting it for himself he's acting it out so we can see the steps of what we've got to do every son of the faith it's going to take this journey just like abraham did and what listen you say oh no that was right there when he met melchizedek no that was when he started back when god called him in genesis 14 15 16 justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost come into circumcision come into body change come into producing the promised child amen he couldn't produce that promised child under son of god revelation it had to be under son of man revelation that's us folks i hope you see this number five proving his word this is one we read this morning let's just read the red part well i i got red in mine now remember let's see if we can find that one now remember there you go he came in three names son of man a prophet son of god the spirit son of david for the millennium but in between this conjunction now according to his own words in the days when the son of man shall be revealed luke 17 30 reveal himself as what not son of god so listen we should have the son of god revelation and have it right all the major doctrines no eternal hell father son holy ghost baptism is not true you understand what i mean everybody got that amen will reveal himself in a different way i'm telling you what the prophet said now what does that make malachi 4 exactly right so in other words you know what he was doing god was identifying if you're going to get anything from the son of man about the son of man you got to listen to malachi 4. luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. you he's pointing us not to the man elijah behold i will send you elijah the prophet the prophet the spirit of elijah in a man called william branham but not the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man the son of man will reveal himself not in a whole big denomination as we've had through the ages but he would manifest himself as son of man again to make manifest malachi 4 and in that day i will send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers faith of the apostolic fathers away from all this scroll up for me please denominationalism and come back to the original word again all right let's go to ezekiel 2 verse 1. we'll read this real quick we'll be done only been an hour now look and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me so remember ezekiel's not a son of god the spirit had to enter him that spirit had to anoint him listen if the spirit enters you today be careful you got the new birth but you should have brought you should have brought him with you amen many anointings but you know i mean many feelings so we're not talking about that ezekiel was not a son of god but he was look he showed him so much this capital s o n son of man stand up on my feet and set me up on my feet that i heard him that spake unto me and i want you to look at this real quick because there's a revelation in here i want you to get and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel now listen in type who are we in type where israel he's going to send ezekiel listen the person in ezekiel is going to be anointed to speak to israel common real israel at that time to prophesy should a man prophesied but remember it has a twofold meaning you and i by revelation are israel right all right and the spirit entered me no and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day now watch i'm going to go through this and i'll go through it again but watch how this goes even through our church ages rebellious generation transgressed against me even to this very day for they are impudent children and stiff-hearted i do send the unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god how many of these people said thus saith the lord paul irenaeus martin columba i know they all did brother rhyme said they had thus saith the lord all right and they whether they will hear or whether they will forebear for their rebellious house he said that twice yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them now do you know if you've had a prophet among you all right and thou son of man little ass so he's talking to ezekiel be not afraid of them need to be afraid of their words what did the angel tell brother branham that don't be afraid of anything you get the people to believe you not even cancer will stand you're standing in your way and thou son of man be not afraid of them remember that's little s that's not big ass that's a little s be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briars and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor deep be dismayed at their looks it's pretty much he's he's coming to a place to where they're not going to be able to touch him because god's going to get the word out all right and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forebear for their most rebellious but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat what i give thee now we're fixing to go we're fixing to go to revelations 10 8. okay so we're going to tie these two together because what is revelations 10 8 a flesh man john standing on patmos telling the angel to give me the book but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be like now rebellious like the rebellious house open the mouth and eat what i give thee and when i looked behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book remember they didn't have books back then it was scrolls rolled up scrolls like a roll right but it's same book a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and that revelation is fine written on the inside and the outside and when i look behold the hand was sent unto me and lord roll the book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentation and mourning and woe all right let's go three this is go to chapter three he continues his thought moreover he saith unto me son of man eat what thou find us now why didn't he tell john the same thing right eat the book eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he sent unto me son of man caused thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this role that i give thee sounds like revelations 10 8 right and fill thy bowels with this role that i give then did i eat and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness it left off the bitterness why did it leave off the bitterness remember in revelations 10 8 9 it says that in my belly and my mouth was sweet as honey and my belly was he didn't have a new birth he didn't have a new birth we have the new birth when we eat it we got to live it ezekiel didn't so much have to live it like we live it so it wasn't it was sweet to him because he what did he do he prophesied he spoke back to him but listen john not only had to speak back he's got to live it so do me and you we got to live it and he said unto me son of man go and get into the house of israel and speak with my words unto them all right ezekiel let's read this right here this is my one of my favorite scriptures this is talking about god in human flesh we're going to talk about some drama and he said unto me son of man capital s if you don't see that can these bones live and i answered oh lord god you're the only one that knows because all i see is a bunch of dry bones again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord what takes you out of your dry darkness and death the word of god thus saith the lord god unto these bones that's got to be something to do with listen you got flesh on the outside but you got bones on the inside okay oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you there's four things that happens here we know that right the four brother brown preached this in um restoration of the bride tree he talks about the four life messages and four death messages but we'll not cover that because we'll we need to get out of here and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone brother let me read real quick one quote brother brown says there must have been a lot of noise he's talking about a pentecostal revival he said there must be a lot of noise shaking a lot of noise but he said but look when the skin came on them and the meat came on them there wasn't much noise so i prophesied as i was commanded and i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld loads of sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them because the son of man had breath all right then said he unto me prophesying to the wind prophesy son of man preachers because that's a little s that's a little s not a big ass that's a little s prophet sign of the wind prophesy son of man in other words preach this message say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live there's no way you're going to get breath from god without hearing it from somebody that's got breath of god amen you got to hear somebody that's got the breath of god or the baptism of the holy ghost okay not your own breath sorry it's a breath of god and breathe upon these slain that they may live now watch this promise because what is our promise i know it's a body change but our promise is a resurrection from the prophesying of the son of man not the son of god son of man listen real quick we'll be done so i prophesied as he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost and we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesying saying to them thus saith the lord o my people i will open your graves i will open your graves son of man prophesy that's a capital let's go back down to 12 again i'm sorry i missed that one go back towards right there noah 11. then he said unto me son of man capital s god is standing there o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and ye shall know that i keep going on 13 there and you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves on my people and brought you up out of your grave and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land now listen this is a promise to israel a natural promise to israel they're going to be restored god's going to give them the holy ghost by 144 000 they're going to have their property in their land over there but listen what is mine in your promised land the baptism of the holy ghost amen and we shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall you know that i the look capital l capital o capital r capital d that's god have spoken it and performed it saith the lord so it's going to happen to national israel but listen folks it's got to happen to me and you it's got to come to me and you you and i are there's to me there's a shaking going on those dry bones we finally know how to get them out of the ground you say do you listen we better start saying something like that you say do you know how no i don't know how but i believe we're getting there i believe we're getting there i believe we're getting strong enough and if it's not me i hope it's you let's stand our feet musicians come prophesy to those dry bones son of man put some flesh on those bones son of man because son of man is what's going to bring the dead out of the ground and whatever bones they have laying somewhere you know what happened to job job says in my flesh now where's job's bones today you probably can't find them but god knows where they are god knows where you are bottom of the sea top of the mountain does not matter he knows where you are and he knows your name prophesy son of man maybe that's our problem we haven't spoken enough but see we won't speak a mess because we got to come to a position listen even jesus christ had to come to a position this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell river jordan three years later he stands on the mountain three years later right or three and a half years later whatever he won't say it he stands on a mountain and matthew in matthew and he says this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him that's why we have to come to adoption in the end time for the son of man to come on the scene we've got to see that we and it's just our mandate to get the dead out of the ground we got to have the son of man here he was the one that stood and said i am the resurrection and the life he was the one who said lazarus come forth and if he's inside of me and you today we got the resurrection inside of us let's sing a song there's a miracle dominating the making [Music] [Music] put your bones back together it takes god to do that [Music] it took god almighty to bring lazarus out of a tomb it took god almighty to make fish and loaves enough to feed 5 000 people one time and 4 000 people the next time that was the son of man oh there's a miracle [Music] you know what the greatest miracle is going to be us realizing who we are [Music] us realizing who we already are not who we're going to be [Laughter] [Music] on [Music] it to him again one more time oh there's a mirror [Music] in the making one just for you the father is working even now your prayers have been heard and the answer is [Music] ezekiel all the dry bones they will send you there was meat there was flesh but it took a breath of life that we naturally don't have we naturally can't bring somebody back from the dead our natural breath can't do it but the son of man can do it his breath is the breath of life and you say well that we're waiting on listen if we're waiting on the son of man to come back we're in trouble amen he's back he's here he's trying to do the work he was sent here to do the capital s-o-n son of man yes the lord jesus christ himself he's trying to get us to see that but it wasn't so much the bone it wasn't the sin you the meat and the flesh everything was right there together but he had to breathe that breath of life inside listen adam was the same way adam needed the breath of life breathing into him and god's the only one who can do that but listen god through you can do that amen god through you can do that you know if you get born again you've received the breath of god the breath of eternal life you've had natural breath all your life from the day the bot the doctor slapped you on the rear end and you started crying that's natural breath that breath will go away but when he breathes that spiritual life inside of you no that's borne by the breath of god now let that thing out let it continue on and this just continue to be diligent seeking god seeking the seeking the right attitude and the right what we've got now the son of man is what we're looking for the son of man not negate don't get away with the son of god do away with the son of god you got to have that you got to have the new birth you got to have the foundation but i didn't i'm not the one that said it's a different way jesus came a different way and he was the son of man so we've got to look at it a different way and it's not going to be hard folks because you know what it's part of the program somebody god saw before the foundational world that somebody every time he had a program somebody would connect to that program and take off with it message he'd have a message he knew that martin luther was going to pick that message up take off with it he knew that they would denominate it and he would die and go off the scene and wesley would pick up a new message a new way and he would take off with it same way with the bride in the end time listen don't look for something odd because you're already odd don't look for something different because you're already different we just got to dig a little deeper and see where the prophet of god tells us a whole another way he's coming a whole nother you know why because the world's going to miss him the world's going to miss this coming they will not only a few people will know about the second coming of jesus christ which is the son of man the world's not going to know it the world's not going to see him come out of the eastern sky and they think and know that that's their savior no he's coming in judgment when he does that amen they've already missed the second coming of jesus christ because who is the second coming of jesus christ we are we're the second coming of christ because he's not coming back in any other flesh but mine and yours amen and that's what the prophet spent all them years trying to tell us god is here you are the word made manifest you are the word made flesh you are not somebody that's coming you are god bless you we love you with the love of the lord we'll see you wednesday night brother bob will be preaching pray for him pray for each and every one of us that we'll all have a good week and that everything will be all
