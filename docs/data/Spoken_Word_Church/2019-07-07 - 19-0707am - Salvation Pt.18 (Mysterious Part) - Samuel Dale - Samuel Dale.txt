========================================

[Music] [Music] surprise yes [Music] good morning Saints what a pleasure it is to be here again sorry to look around and see brother Colley and I here and the rest of them but Lord you know wherever they are they're with us in our hearts would this pray that him bring them on through those doors we're gonna read Psalms 19 this morning funny thing I happened yesterday brother Mark come in a lot of times we'll be able to sneak in the back room and sit down and just have a word with him and he showed that Lord had brought something to his heart particularly about what brother Dale has been preaching and I think it's a good point for all of us to see that as we open God's Word and read God's Word we always got to be looking what God's trying to tell us in his word and I've always complicated it in my little pea brain up here but we always got to be looking in it and I just asked this morning as we read the Psalms 19 that you'd be looking for justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost showing up and just be looking for it because it's always there before we open the word this morning let's just have a word of Prayer oh is that the ones it's not here today this I hope it burdens your heart for them because faith comes by hearing and by hearing of the word and we certainly have the word here and let's just pray and that's God to strengthen the faith of the ones that couldn't come through the door this morning all right dear Heavenly Father we thank you for this place you've given us on this earth father in this time that we've come to the Lord that your word has come to full maturity Lord that we must take this word and all of it not just part of it we have to take all of it Lord and let us get out of the way and father touch and bless these humble bodies father and and feed our hungry souls Lord place your word in us that you have you wait with us and that our footsteps be your footsteps father God on this earth because we're the only thing that this world is going to see you through us Lord sanctifies father God that we can fulfill that and we ask now Lord as we come and open your word and you just come down and touch us Lord and be with each one here today there's come to hear from you father bless brother Dale as he's preparing to bring your word father more two messages he's been bringing father on the simple things as we say simple they're not really simple Lord because I'm glad brother Dale is preaching over and over and over and over again bringing this word and sweeping it through our souls Lord that we can see our journey that he is speaking of our journey and we must see it Lord open our eyes nor understand and bless brother Wade and all the ones in the Sunday School classes here today your word comes forth to his father and again bless those it couldn't be here today for whatever hinders said we asked these things and bless the opening of your word he asked in your name Lord Jesus Christ amen I brought help this morning hmm Psalms 19 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard which is as a bridegroom coming out of the chamber and rejoice as a strong man to run a race let the Lord the Lord is perfect converting the soul and testimony of the Lord is sure making wise this simple the affair of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether moreover by them as a servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward keep back thy servant from presumptions of sin let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be ignorant from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and meditation of my heart be acceptable in the sight O Lord my strength and my Redeemer amen you may be seated [Music] open the eyes to see oh Jesus I see to see [Music] shining in the loving for out your power and [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of jewelry pour out their power in amen amen [Music] so [Music] I want to see [Music] amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you yeah did you see a fight in the house of the Lord like the turning these scriptures turned back to where we've been reading from Ephesians an ezekiel i'll try to continue i thought moving on I pray that you had a we had a real good time last night in the Bible study you know we had almost as many as we out here we had over 50 in the Bible study last night and it's not much more here today that was good huh I'm glad I ever had a good time we actually ran over time because we got tired up talking and things and you know might do you good sometimes just come and see you know so I don't know we'll just come and stay you know might have a good time okay no we did we had a real good time now remember the Lord willing this coming Sunday where the phony will be with us and to minister unto us and then remember the next one which is the third weekend which would be on Saturday will be the fellowship meeting that brother Tom crocheting so remember these announcements that are made I think Wade in June is going to be going that weekend to Arizona so remember those and don't just be much in the prior okay any other announcements let's see yeah I got mom said I write my own instead of all ones and notes up at the front where I can read them you know but I'll get to those in a minute anybody anything that we miss okay dear Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and this time that we have that we can set down and just listen to you Lord it's not a thing that we are forced into doing things we do over our own accord if we don't do it of our own accord then it's no good anyway but we just pray that you'd bless each one and help us all to look to you the author and finisher of our faith we love you and we thank you forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and keep us in Jesus name Ephesians 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith remember journey and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God okay a journey of a Christian okay now let's go to Ezekiel where we've been reading from the last couple of messages ezekiel 36:24 I will take you from among the heathen and gather your out of all countries and we'll bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols when I cleanse you a new heart also would I give you in a new spirit when I put within you and I will take away that stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I wrote my own self a note because we will be continuing on him so if you would listen our read the message called the stature of a perfect man we will be eventually going into this and getting into you know into that place the Lord willing brother Bob and singing but you must be back there in the back so all right the Lord willing brother Bob will be ministering horses coming Wednesday so little you know and then waiter then would be gone the next one or so let's go just remember all of these announcements all right now what are we talking about what was our life thought we've come up through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to be the new birth all right now the Prophet said is we were talking about last night in the Bible study they asked him was it required that we have justification sanctification the baptism with Holy Ghost to have the new work he said yes or absolutely is a correct word then he used we'll see then that's what we've tried to get you to see and get you to look at I'm not trying to get you to doubt what you've got that's between you and God but I've asked you to consider that because if it offends you what we say about justification same case baptism a little ghost then you're not born again now if that offends you for me to say either way all right it's the truth in because the Prophet is one it taught it so we believe it all right now the last part we came to was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire that was our life statements of this past Wednesday talking about coming to that final to the stage of the new birth being made manifest into our hearts and our lives and what it was then that justification shuts off you Pisceans sanctification cleanses you and set you aside and the baptism with the Holy Ghost comes and dwells and brains are put within us the person of Jesus Christ in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is the new birth all right now when we studied about money that said the baptism when the Holy Ghost and with fire cause you see there's a lot left in us even though we've been you could be justified even though you can be sanctified you're still a human being you still got that old nature of in you you don't have the snake no no it's gone but it's our natural nature of human beings and who we are they're still there all right you said well it well went out of me when when the snake went out we'll what came in there's not as much to deal with what went out is to deal with what comes in well because if God don't come and live in our heart then we're not born again remember we've emphasized over and over why the Prophet said it when he said it like this he said yes you've accepted Jesus Christ but says has he accepted you the brother Brennan said if he's accepted you he will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost if he's accepted you well what would be the problem what did we study through that part is that we we can have all of that took out of us yes all of it cleaned out of us but we're still ourselves I'm emphasizing that over and over because even after you're born again you still have to deal with your old nature they didn't take out everything out of us cause we're sanctified it just sets cleanse it enough to work God could use it I see then you've got to come to a place to where that God could come and live in and as he comes and lives in see then he burns out what's left so that's why I said Holy Ghost and with fire that's what your prophet said on the future home he cleanse out everything that's left and comes and live because he's not gonna come in us is there something in there now that ought to be the emphasis to understand all points about the new birth is the fact that you can not have God and the devil in your soul at the same time cause God will not dwell in an unclean vessel all right then that's got to be taken out of it all right see then that was what we were covering how that that Holy Ghost burns out everything that's left of us he burns that out and comes to live in our soul and making that the new birth all right so there is your new birth and what we've been talking about so we're gonna stop right there at at that point in jump today now because we're going over to the end of the message because I've reached a position that I want to go over kind of to the end of the message and then come back and preach on it so I want you to think about that today that of what I'm trying to do I'm jumping a long ways now so then that will we will be covering it you know you know in a way to understand all right so then the Holy Ghost coming in burns out all that's left of you and places his own life this is a quote from brother Branham which is the baptism with the Holy Ghost into you as the new birth all right see that's the dove that comes in that's the dove is we could put up the draw in and put the dove up in the but that's the dove that comes in which is the holy spirit to come and live in us all right now in that then see we can depend on him to lead us through those doors where Paul would say it's not a I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and said the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so we don't credit anything in our new birth to be of us it's all God he's come to live in us all right he says now sure you can still be tempted but a true born-again Christian cannot sin we were talking about that last night see because that person is inside of you they do wrong that one that's inside of you can't do wrong the conus eternal life alright so then we start from that point now and I want us to to move up but I want you to watch the point now because we're going to go through a couple of things in the message and watch it alright we covered that depend Costas the message of their day the message of the Pentecostals day and time was three works three stages of grace justification sanctification baptism and Holy Ghost now some of them that were called Pentecostals you know some of it were called Pentecostals were some that like you're what would want you brethren call them the something Methodist there's a group in there that they they believe that sanctification is the baptism of the holy ghost so but they call themselves are recording themselves as being like Pentecostals Pentecostals covers a whole large thing from the oneness to the Tunis to the Faunus to the Church of God to the Church of Christ you know but their message I want you to watch that now because it's very vital to understand where they stand to know where we stand and that's the purpose of the day we're gonna go over here then we're going to drop back and pick up so we'll pick up stature of a perfect man okay now watch then the Pentecostals message was justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost with the Prophet said they cabbage down on that alright and he said they missed it he said because we're Ezekiel says I give you a new heart and a new spirit he said the Pentecostals people took that new spirit as being that tongues and the shoutings and the glory hallelujah and believing that was the new birth he said that wasn't it now what about telling the Pentecostal people I mean the whole ranks of the Pentecostal movement and him telling them that they would didn't have what they thought they had no wonder they got upset with no wonder they turned against him no wonder he went from thousands and meetings to half a dozen why because the word began to open all right now evidently now if he told him that he'd been the Prophet don't you think that that Holy Spirit within that prophet would let him know what those people were doing and how they were doing what with that new spirit you remember how we brought it he said in Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart he takes away the old stony heart yeah and give us a heart of flesh we taught that in the Baptist Church all right see called we could see a little bit but we didn't see the the you know new spirit new heart and with I mean the new spirit and in my spirit no we didn't see none of that but we talked the fact that that unclean spirit going out and all of that things we didn't teach it may be that away but we did believe in a mellow heart the word that we come out with a heart of flesh to be mellow and be you know sincere all right now so then be in that away now look at what I'm Tom bow if they miss their message did he miss their message other day I'm talking about before brother branham come on the scene they had the message of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost the Pentecostals had that before the Prophet came on the scene he said they cabbage down on it and wouldn't go on with it and didn't believe it within if they'd done that do you think we can't do that we see no no don't no we can't do that well we're this that rather well okay if they miss their message and we don't get it in a straight order of understanding could it be that we miss this massive oh no no well what's the problem with all of this now on the Internet's and all of these things we've got one message how many different doctrines are there from one message how many different ideas or thoughts or ports from one message okay now if you see Ezekiel as I tried to cover Ezekiel is a marvelous scriptures in the point that he described what would be in the Azusa Street Pentecostal movement that it would go from a new heart to a new spirit and I put my spirit in you and Ezekiel covered that looking all the way down to the end time because he would see as I've covered the Scriptures he'd say that I took you from among the people I brought you in I washed you clean I've done all of it and then I made way for you to receive you eternal life back there right that was a CQ speaking of the coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right so down through the ages you've got that baptism of the Holy Ghost if we were trying to cover life not in a lot enough in the Bible study that see each person this is what I believe in this way I've always taught because the Prophet said it is it necessary that we have justification same casing about you long ago he said absolutely all right absolutely sin exactly right all right see then if we argue that point then what age are we in because your prophet come to tie together all of the loose ends right we'll get to that in a minute what about one of those things being the new birth what about one of the things being a statue of a perfect man what about those things that we claim we understand okay so now let's get to the point of what we're talking about then the Prophet brought the message to tie together as will cover the loose ends that was left out he names them loose ends on a lot of it the loose ends would be something that was not totally set down in order so he was telling the Pentecostals you've left loose ends that by you don't know what the new birth is don't you think it was something for him to stand up there and talk to those people about the new birth and him be able to look right down in that person and see they wouldn't ride or did they miss that by taking that new spirit to be the Holy Spirit instead of waiting for the Holy Ghost to come in its complete fullness but I believe only their pinnacle I'm drowning on day of Azusa Street I believe that was the new birth that was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he came upon a people and that's what's so amazing I've tried to get you to look at it see we think you've always got a visitor kind of it you realize on the day of Azusa Street when the Holy Ghost fell it fell on Trinitarian people they were not oneness until about 1912 leaveners well somewhere in there for the one that's ever come into being they were Pentecostal people but there were Trinitarians see so you see why they missed their message and we were talking about it last night and the brother asked the question about it we're brother Branham said a new Trinity comes out well the old Trinity was what a Trinitarian doctrine that come out and was brought over into even from Azusa Street they were still believing those things of a Trinitarian doctrine all right he said then a new Trinity will come out well could we be in the place of that new Trinity could we be taking our own thoughts and ideas and it would be contrary to what the prophets say it but yet was not we're not gonna change it okay now look so then this life's aged now here's where we want to start from because I believe and I've called it from the day one when I seen one two prophets if I believe Azusa Street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth I believe that's what they had all right and see having the baptism of the holy ghost see then that was the pouring out of the promise that I pour out my spirit upon all flesh literally it was more of a promising back under because when he poured out the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost you didn't have the false find involved he said I pour out my spirit upon all things your sons and out my handmaids the owner Zeus's tree that was poured out upon everything Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost or really they wouldn't call Pentecostals until that time all right and as that was poured out upon them they accepted it and took it and put it down as being tongues as evidence our signs and wonders okay now and I from a firm believer in that and here comes brother Branham alone and what is he saying there's a lot of people in this message don't believe that there's Uther Street had any thought well if they didn't you don't have anything stand on what are you standing them I'm standing here today that's why I've done it and have defended it so hard I stand here today on justification that Martin Luther talk I stand on sanctification that John Wesley talked about I don't deny any of that that was God for the Aged that was the new birth for the aged that was part of the kingdom of God for the aged and if you don't believe they had the new birth then where do you get your idea from see they had a new birth of the time the age in the points we were talking about life not discussing it quite lengthy yeah get to point then with going into the message this last age Azusa Street completed the birth that's where we're gonna start from now so you're gonna have to hold on it completed the birth okay there's where your profits told and that's how much he may I'm Liam pointed to what they had they had the new birth he said I met people that had the baptism of the Holy Ghost fifty years he said before I come along the genuine now listening he's in exactly like on the day of Pentecost did you think people accept that I've told you about it was sitting in a minute two brothers we we were at a place were sitting there discussing it and that topic came up and they both said they couldn't understand I said white why can't you understand I said on the day of Pentecost there was two things took place the Upper Room experience was a hundred and twenty they had been tutored by the Lord Jesus and when the Holy Ghost fell it gave them what we would talk about the stature of a perfect man in the Sun not the heads don't go to that and come yet all right but three thousand outside only heard one message so there's a simple answer to the Prophet saying it he wasn't saying that the hundred twenty in the upper room just had a small amount no he was saying they were genuinely born-again but the ones outside see at the new birth yes but that new birth there was not a one of them out of that three thousand that was used to write the word all that was used to write the word come from the 120 in the upper room well because they didn't have it they were having to depend upon that that's why Peter was teaching the stature of a perfect man who - who - to the 3,000 that received the Holy Ghost but that was only the new birth for their age in time we'll get to that in the stature of a perfect man as we go along all right but watch now go ahead were number 1 let's read a few up but then if the Pentecostal message was the last message with justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost the lies three messages the life story Church ages forms the complete birth okay no is he right he's talking about the Pentecostal people that think that completes the birth all right now then in a minute we'll get to it where he said but there was a lot of loose ends left but it completed the birth well if people say but I don't believe in penance and then the looser streets had a new birth well I don't believe you got it if that's what you believe so we got each other fighting with each other about it right cuz why can't you believe they have the new birth well they had all these problems and this that you know what's your problem we're gonna put it on problems what's your problem I'm going to try my best to believe what that prophet said that he met people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost exactly like the day of Pentecost there are you going to accept that point as to be what he said do you need that wouldn't we we can bring all of these up but look what he says the last three ages completed the birth justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Azusa Street or we call it the Pentecostals completed to birth or in other words brought the birth back to her that it would be like the book of Acts see there's word you'll go with it and and do but won't listen to what somebody that's trying to explain it it's saying about it you go I don't see how them Pentecostals could have had the baptism of the Holy Ghost well look what they're done they had this probably had a well watch your problem see I just put it plain you say well I just don't see how they could have had the new birth when you're saying the Prophet was wrong that's your choice he said they had the new birth he said they had and that it was completed in that of that new birth well I never thought about it like that because I heard brother so-and-so saying all they had was this Gilson signed in wonder what do you think they had in that day if they had gifts they had to hold it goes well I just don't well okay that's you don't believe it but now go tell everybody else you don't believe it trying my best to be honest to you I say what I say for the pulpit but you go yakety-yak to each other about what you believe that where I'm wrong why don't you come and tell me at least we could sit down and talk it out but I'm talking it out here I'm putting it plain as I can be your prophet is the one that said it not me that the life three ages completed the birth or hot didn't they must have had to do birth then he said it completed the birth little Wren said one day liked it he said they was in other words he said the early Azusa Street is basically what he's saying but he said there were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are you need that quote well see how that could become what's he told they were living a Christian life under the word of their age and really crying out to God there were being good Christians and there was didn't you say well what are we what are we here what are we doing all right we're here to understand the Word of God then to walk Darian all right now so are you satisfied with that he said it completes the birth okay well then that was back there well I don't believe it wasn't he said it so you're arguing with him that's that's nothing to me and you and you set in my office and say brother Dale I don't believe it I'm gonna say he said it then you saying you don't believe him cause he's the one who said it well I think he meant well now I don't care about your mince or me either one What did he say that's what he meant right okay now let's go to number two and pick up a thot and get into this for the rest of the message he's talking about in this last age and how that it's gonna come to where we're at all right so listen takes the book seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel or this alone the mysteries of God is the Ministry of the seventh angel okay that's the Ministry of the seventh angel is to want to tell us about these things what did brother on them come far we just come through the ages and history of proving this the angels message of the seventh church all right revealed all the mysteries that's been in the past all the things in the PI's revelations 10 1 through 7 that's to be and remember in the days of the seventh angel he's sounding for blasting forth the gospel trumpet used to finish all the mysteries of God okay what is the message for this age what was the Prophet to do the Zeus the street completed the birth he didn't come to bring a new birth to Azusa Street they completed it that's what he said now it's like here come forth in the early church age we'll get to it after a while first it was a doctor knife fitted in he said they didn't become a saying first then a doctrine and then there then become a statute then become a church and through the dark ages and out of the dark ages come the first Reformation Luther and he brought with him all kind of mysterious things that happened during that church age all back in Darcy but he never finished it up Luther didn't finish it up Wesley did finish it looser Street didn't finish him it's this message that's the one for the finish not Lutheran Wesley done that they've done the best they could do they had God for their time and they they come forth with the message all right listen then along come Wesley was sanctification some more of it but still never finished it left loose the ends everywhere such as sprinkling them to the baptism and Luther took Father Son and Holy Ghost and still of the Lord Jesus try all these different things but tell us where we take that and say we're Lutheran Wesleyan didn't how nothing now brother rather said they'll come the birth was completed on the zoo Street the message right within West Lutheran Westland him you said well Lutheran wedding them didn't have nothing I'd like for you to show me that because they had two new births for their time if they didn't have the new birth they're not in the body across because it requires the new birth to be in the body of Christ all right so then let's let them be what they are they had loose ends one because they were not profits they were reformers rah ten alone come to Pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy ghost cabbage down on that there cannot be no more ages that end of that now that's all of it that's to fill our the the legacy in but then we found in the studying of the scripture that the messenger to the aides come right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the end of the age we find out Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age look at into the Catholic age and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and the Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the holy ghost or what come for the Pentecostals and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word has God helped me to not to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those blue sins out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapture of the church now that's brother Brent Spence he's right that's brother Brad Abraha okay that's the one we're talking about that we're kind of believe that's the one that said that the Pentecostals had completed the birth then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders see that's where we get all that Tata I believe through those seven thunders be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together okay you know we can go to deal with that part we're just going on with what we're talking about what I'm trying to get you to see one time and the Prophet come to bring this message there was a lot of loose ends and he had to pick it up and bring it forth okay let's go go to number three and our messengers promised in Malachi for the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring forth the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new bird from according to Malachi 4 the bride is to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 the words the prophets message is to birth you in me Azusa Street finished completed the birth of the ages but this word has got to be birthed by somebody to prove that it's correct well they don't have to be correct come on get off him ain't gonna argue me but look the message is to bring back the word this prophet was to bring back the word who want the word that the bride could be delivered from a new birth or by new birth now do you understand what I've tried to explain in the days of Martin Luther Martin Luther was a was a oh he called it a monks in a monastery studying and doing those things and God appeared to him and brought him the message or the just shall live by faith and that was the word for the age that was the new birth for that age the just shall live by faith John Wesley come forth with sanctification that was the word for that age that was the new bird for that age Zeus the street came forth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the restoration of the gifts signs and wonders yes but that was the birth of the age see then here we come and what do we get we are to be delivered that's what he said she's to be delivered of a new bird I'm according to Monica for who is to be delivered the Bride of Christ this message has got to be birthed by somebody a birth means are coming forth into somebody's got to come forth into this message and be the very message right cause if they're not you realize all the rest is waiting on you and everything is waiting on you or not for us to give birth to the message that has been brought well those don't see nothing like this unless that's all right you can take what you want to do what you like what you see when then brother Branham would make statements people just go who you are look at the next one what does he say number four look what he says and then we find out then these mysteries are supposed to be revealed and why didn't these other men Wesley Lutheran these great reformers who brought out justification sanctification Pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy spirit still why didn't he catch these these messages why didn't they get them because they were reformers that's the reason Luther and him could not go any farther than they went they were reformers all right look they take on the other side there was people come in who was Paris Kings is explained with these the reason that all of the stray ends of the mysterious part about justification the mysterious part of sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism with the Holy Ghost now he said they went through their time and their ages and done what they're supposed to do but there was a mysterious part left a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification a mysterious part of the baptism when the Holy Ghost now remember that's in the seals where is explaining what is the mysterious part of justification what is the mysterious part of sanctification what's the mysterious part of the baptism when the old ago the two seals is to bring out the two prophet was to bring in not me and you not brother day old or anybody else it was the Prophet to bring the ones that's the reason I read that where he was to come forth and bring together all the loose ends and he did he brought forth the mysterious part of these uh-huh but what did he bring brother Dale well he brought the mysterious part in other words he brought justification from what man thought it was saying to a correct understanding of what really justification is he brought sanctification from a place of what man thought it was see most people think sanctification means you don't cut you higher you don't smoke you don't drink you don't you most everybody think that's what sanctification here well I quit this and I quit that thinking that's what sanctification is you know that brother Branham says your name goes on the book as a believer that's sanctification know my name went on the book for the world the Prophet says it sanctification means a whole lot more than what we think justification means a whole lot more than just chopping off your pipes in that's what I've tried to get you to see that's what wages tried to get you sick remember he preached on this not too long ago the mysterious part of justification well what you mean mysterious part of just going to shuts off by saying there's a mysterious part because the bride is to be delivered from a new birth according to Malachi floor so this message is to bring you and me to an understanding of the new birth that has never been understood by mankind this message is to bring us to a new birth that mankind never understood so what is it [Music] what is this mysterious part it was something that was not revealed but yet it was spoke of all the way back through Ezekiel in his saying a new heart and a new spirit and I put my spirit he was explaining this mystery but do we understand it I'm talking about a mystery I'm talking about something that nobody before this prophet came had it in its total clarity because in the Old Testament they could not bring those things to the right order because they were not born again right see but when the Prophet came on the scene now what's where he lays these things out what is the mysterious part of justification what is the mysterious part of scientific ation what is the mysterious part of the baptism of the holy go what did we find justification to be we found it to be the chopping off of your past sins now that's been understood by everybody we taught in the Baptist that your sin for a ways we might not have told it as bad as justification but we taught it as you come in to the altar repenting of your sins and God takes away those sins from what that he puts it so far I can remember that until now even thinking about when the man coming he said and he took it so far he said not from the north to the south he said because that won't work he said but from the east to the West because there's no stopping and starting point from east to the west north and south got to stop and born the east to the west thing got no stopping born because you just go right back around right there's no stopping in Spartan from these to it so that's why the scripture says that our sins are put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more as far as the east is to the west which is no stopping and starting so whatever he done with my sins they still cannot be brought against me because there in his seal forgetfulness the justification is a great thing but what about when your prophet come into it let's run through this in a hurry where you can get it caught see I'm trying to put this here and then we'll drop back you go to a little message where brother Brennan was talking about call the invisible union of the Bride of Christ I'd ask you to do that go to that message and listen to it late I can't listen Oh master get out ain't nobody gonna tell me what do okay you flunked algebra yeah they they had a teacher over banks County that she was real good at algebra and anybody that studied under her were taught knots in algebra the bird she would flunk you in a hurry they called her flunking Duncan because that was her last name was Duncan and bird she would flunk you on that if you didn't do what was right she didn't have no halfway between didn't know good to take an apple to try to get her on your side she was straight but those who believed and stayed with her come forth is to be in great algebra masters right because the way she was doing all right but see justification what does it do it jumps off our pie sins go to the invisible union and listen to it it would take the whole book for me to express as I'm asking you to and if you ain't got enough in you to go study that message then you don't care what's being said then you don't know what brother Brahim said the in that message he covers justification is chopping off your PI sins in that message he goes on to cover justification was the fact of what you were guilty of doing it you done it but it was as though you never done it because God took it away study that from that message of invisible Union it was though you never done it stage 2 stage 3 of justification is that you are so pure and clean that the real you never done it note invisible Union study the message you claim to believe the prophet go study the message what do you think I got it have to teach this wrong from the invisible Union because an invisible Union he covers that your sins are chopped off then he covers that it says though you never done it because he took your place and put your sins in the sea I forget them but see the real you which is not you as a human being the real you is the person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost living in your soul right the real you is the new birth that new birth never did sin we done all of them things but you can't make him a sinner so mysterious part of justification or that we taught off your chopping off you PI sins sure we tried to bring it up a little further and talk about the sea of his forgetfulness never to be remember no more but you see your prophet started right there and took it on the showing that the real you the baptism of the Holy Ghost never did sin that's why the Bible says that his seed remaineth in you you cannot sin but brother Dale brother Brad who said Christians in where do you sin as a Christian you better not be sinning from the soul cause you're sinning from the soul you and Christian you better get out there in that spirit room in your memories and start to see in from that point so then the Bible's right the prophets right what it's impossible he said for a Christian to sin then he turns around and says accreted only one who can't sin he's here all know he was teaching it correctly repentance chops off that high sins does nothing to your nature anything so you see it a mysterious part now for no draw hide that I am could come up years ago and bring those things 40 years ago how much more did your prophet understand about the real meaning of justification what do you mean I mean if he's put RCA's send him to see if forgetfulness they can't be remembered no more that's a pretty good state of saint of justification don't you think so and the Bible says those who he's justified what he hath already glory thought if you were genuine and repented of your sins they were chopped off if you're genuine you were to go you'll go on and prove that you'll be glorified one day you've got a journey to travel to but you prove you're right if you're genuine Christian sanctification see sanctification like justification is taught in three stages sanctification is a cleansing and setting aside right you were cleansed and set aside because that's what sanctification does what you see the Apostle Paul then after getting the new birth he taught a sanctification more than just a cleansing he taught a daily sanctification Paul taught after you're born again but I've got born again I don't need to be sanctified no more hey that's where we put her big mouth up and we run it instead of listening to what he say it let's listen to what he's saying look at number seven let's see what this Apostle Paul understood about sanctification first Corinthians 15 31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord daily when he's already born again what do you need to die for because what we do every day what do we need to repent for for what we do every day okay let's see what the prophets say go ahead to number eight days of our life but we are buns slaves to Jesus Christ we are slaves of joy I'm so glad that I got shackles only that shackles me away from the things of the world that I could become a slave to Jesus Christ to serve Him in love in you and my brothers and sisters who are like precious faith who's been born of the Holy Ghost well that's left us open oh come on read what he says this had the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify and cleanse you from all the filth of the world that died daily to your flesh crucified putting it away and becoming a slave to your own body to serve God we look for a city to come sanctification is a cleansing and setting aside within after you're born again Paul talk about daily sanctification Stage one is chopping off you is a cleansing and setting aside stage two comes up to a daily sanctification there you need these Loretta Brennan said I die daily and if Paul had to die daily how much more am i I'm going to have to stay there dead all the time if Paul had to die daily to stay with God so we'll all have to do that just die out to ourselves and that's getting God's Way how many of you want I mean these you want me to read die daily where we got to keep in revival constantly revived ever day Paul said he had to die daily for Christ that Christ could live and we must never let that revival die cuz we do that's your revival that's what I've tried to explain to you I have a revival every day but it's through the washing of the water or the word the studying of God's Word should bring us a revival every day in our hearts and lives to realize what he does to love us you've got to repent and die daily to live in Jesus Christ so every day every day you got to die every day to live in Jesus brother Branham we have problems number thirteen contending for the faith we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us then there's none without sin every day you sin and Paul said he had to die daily and if we say that we sin and have no sin then the Bible says we make God to lie okay we didn't teach too much of that and the Baptist I don't know about y'all where you come from and how much and the Pentecostals they talk that are dying daily but Paul taught it so the first stage of sanctification is one lens and set aside for service second stage is to keep us clean what's the third stage of sanctification run cities in the seals so Wade covered it what is sanctification under the seal there's going to be a cleansing of this whole world under the sixth seal now there's a sanctification under the sixth seal that the Bible covers that we didn't know anything about called we didn't know anything about the seals but the prophet knew about it and covered it for us then we can die daily right a mysterious part a mysterious part is that God can cleanse this world until it can be lived on a mysterious part that he can so cleanse you and I until he can come and live in us and take us in a rapture okay gotta get in hurry baptism of the Holy Ghost three stages of the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Romans 8 you can go ahead and pull it Romans 8 you want to know that's that would be 14 only Roman eight Romans eight covers three things the new birth to make us children of God that were so much until we've become his offspring Romans eight but then there is a point of adoption in Romans eight that brings us to a place that was never taught by mankind to understand with a part of adoption to where we see who we are and what's taking place we'll get into that in Statue of a perfect man but you see one day this world even will get such a fiery baptism until it will burn off all sin and burn all demons all things that go would be done by baptism of fire but that was what I was talking about the other day see that baptism a fire that comes into you cleanse got all the devil's that's in there they know Devils left in your soul if you have the new birth and it'll so cleanse us until we're going to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 Paul goes on to 23rd for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God that's adoption right what are these the children are supposed to understand because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God where we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now because something's got to happen and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit to understand or to set into motion and get it into what what the redemption of the body you see justification of sanctification the baptism when Holy Ghost then it is a mystery under the seals your prophet took in that mystery us all the way to the change of the body right the Prophet took the message in the seals all the way to the change of the body because that's the last thing that were to have is a body change cause then we'll go into glory you see one down mad the Prophet said a mysterious part so there was things it was not understood about the justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the Prophet brought it and showed it to us by that can we be delivered of a new birth well bro down I didn't know we hadn't have a new birth we gotta have a birth of the message of the age not another birth to go back and be born again but a point of being truly completely born again I've always taught you one thing let's see I mean ever can remember it with our body soul and spirit it's totally redeemed surely you can say I have the new birth you remember that that's 4050 years I've been preaching that because that's what I believe that if we come to the place that were so cleansed and set aside so filled with that baptism when the Holy Ghost hang on just a second come on musician let me read this likes to cuz you see I love these I didn't give them this black bear when the message oneness 1962 but God wants to feel every fiber of his church he wants to feel you're thinking he wants to feel your mind he wants to feel every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just surrender in God till his word just living it right through you you don't have nothing else but God you stay with the word they'll ever fiber of your being never fiber of the church okay once more priest in 1963 once more Lord move over the Holy Ghost well excuse me once more let the Holy Ghost take this audience break down the powers of the enemy and feel every fiber of the baptism of the Holy Spirit I've always quoted that to you because I believe it so you said well brother Dale the what are you looking for I'm looking for such a baptism and the Holy Ghost to come that it'll fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture but what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost a revealed word come on what is the baptism of the Holy go the word made alive so that's what I've always told the alive word will change these beings that we are the prophets brought the message we don't have to look for anything in that we have the message we are to be delivered of a new birth from the message that we are in this age of Malecha for the fill every fiber of our being in tuck us in the rapture yeah I look for something to take place yes California had an earthquake the other day six point what for them they had another one who I went it yesterday seven bought one now your prophets seeing it like this he said after a series of earthquakes California will go under a series means one after the other so they've been they have probably a thousand earthquakes a day in California but not to big uns 7 is a big and see if you go from a six now I know that six or four you're not calculator but say one of them is a six and another one is a seven do you know what that means an earthquake terminology every time you go up one number you go ten times the number seven is ten times more powerful than a number six come on study your science a little ten times and the six will flatten city or seven ten times take it apart the only part where we had less time done in the statute perfect land culture we took it to dad right up to the change of the body this message has the change of the body in it we're not looking for another message or imagined dyrdek on this nation [Applause] is the message of eternal trust this prophet come to tie together all the little sins and bring the message to the change of the body [Music] [Applause] if you want God [Music] bless my soul I know hey touch me [Music] the service in life not ask brother Joe and them about it they'll make your copy alive [Music] [Applause] every interaction for [Music] this mattress and everybody need [Music] Emani [Music] of an uber from a belfie how do you think that profit fellow [Music] coming up there seeing that [Music] Northerly was snowing what are you gonna do to turn that jerk [Music] to the face of the phone because something something happen and he touch me for I will Shaku [Music] seems our new great time we believe it so we just send this father in the name of Jesus Christ our sister has a great desire in her heart she has a a big desire for her family Lord you just reach down and touch him we send each prior college and we believe it that whatever she had asking for they'll be done because we promised in Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] my father we thank you for the day now just asking the Lord to open our understanding of what we're trying to say because we believe the Prophet brought everything right down to where we're at and we stand here looking and desiring to see a finish of all of these things and to know that when he's finished that father will give all the honor and glory the one that brought the word unto us we just ask you to help us help us to see like the things the Prophet would say a mysterious part he knew there was great mysteries left there they would have to come forth one of those would be a new burger from according to malachi for how much more do we need it then we need to seek after you for understanding of what we do how need up but the glory and what we've seen let your love and your grace be with us all goddess in Jesus name you dismiss you
