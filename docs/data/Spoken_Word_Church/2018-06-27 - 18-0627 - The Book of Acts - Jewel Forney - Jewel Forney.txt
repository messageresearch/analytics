========================================

god bless y'all it's almost either June's birthday coming up in July second and it's her fourth birthday and I like to make it a point every year to remind y'all about the trial we went through because it's our nature as humans to forget you know as as people we forget the things Lords done for us so I wanted to remind you all of that that we went through that trial most of you know about it if you haven't seen it you can get the testimony downstairs and by the Richards office but Richard Roberts office there's a Seabee rack the testimony DVD is still available down there for some of the new ones that have come along but basically when she was born she had a pretty mature lung condition she was premature and we thought it was a minor thing and by her third day of her life she was born Wednesday night on Saturday night she was almost dead and Saturday night we left her thinking that she would be dead when we got back we was really low and we left her went to the bough statement came back she was still alive but that number that we kept watching for all that time that the doctors were concerned about that oxygen saturation which is the oxygen in the blood was down to 37% when we got back and then we left and went home but her other kids to bed they called and said we've got to send her to Egleston because there's no more we can do for her at Northeast Georgia now Northeast Georgia is a pretty high ranking medical facility and that was my big concern that was alarming that they would call in the middle of the night and instead there's no more we can do so then the center to Atlanta and then on the way down that's when the paramedic or nurse whatever working on her said that we nearly lost her baby twice during the transport she nearly died twice and then when they got down there the doctor Karpin medicine said your baby's dying we had this procedure we can cut her jugular vein open and stick a tube down in her heart to bypass the function of the lungs put oxygen in the blood that's the last resort so they never had to do that and we went to church that Sunday morning and came back down there to see her again and she would have started turning around so 30 days later which was a month old and she came home about a half a million dollar baby I thank God for health insurance but anyway and then this testimony today is about EULA not IVA can you pull up the picture brother Joe for the bulb so EULA when she was two and three years old she around that time she had frequent seizures they call him febrile seizures where she had a would have a fever it was spiked and caused her to go into a seizure and it was no big deal we saw her house so many of them it kind of became a normal thing we took it at the doctor they never could diagnose the problem we finally quit taking taking her to the doctor in over two years she hasn't had a single seizure eventually well now about a month ago on a Monday she had a seizure totally out of the blue and no fever as we could tell associated with it I had been working all night Sunday night came home midday Monday about like usual gaving I went upstairs to fold laundry listen to a sermon I kid you not my finger was falling - press play on a sermon and that's when chaos broke loose downstairs that's how the devil works you know he's completely against the revelation of the word that we possessed he don't want us to hear the word and so forth well this was not a normal screen this was mercy and harmony and Abba screaming at the top of their lungs totally fearful totally afraid and and something had just terrified them and they were calling out ulah ulah ulah so we went running down the stairs to meet them and found Yulin a seizure well that's no big deal nothing unusual except it's been over two and a half years since she had one and there was also no fever associated with this one whenever they get that picture up you'll see how normal she looked I happened to take a picture right before she had this seizure not knowing that she was gonna have a seizure I took a picture because she's cute found out then that I could use it in the testimony just to show you how normal she looked this was a very abnormal case all right and she was laid back in this chair that you'll see in the picture no I didn't take a picture during the seizure okay it's kind of weird she was laid back in the chair I was rolled back and saliva and blood coming out of her mouth and not breathing now that was the abnormal thing it had been normal for us to see her have a seizure but I don't recall her breathing ever stopping before so that was the concerning part and what took place next week went over there to ER and laid hands on her and prayed and saw the Lord cast that demon off of her and she came back started breathing again and was perfectly normal and eventually she revived him she was still unconscious for a little while after that but finally she revived that was probably 40 minutes before the seizure and she laid over in that chair and I was so sure that she was choking because of the lack of breathing once I ruled that out though I later on the floor and we pray now on the spiritual aspect it wasn't unusual for us to pray for our kids and see God touched them we've done that many times and see God touch our kids that's not what the testimony is about this testimony is about the boldness associated with that brother Dale has been talking about a nod from God the boldness that the Apostles had in the book of Acts when they were just charged into room take charge brought my brother branham says take every spirit under my control there was no fear there was no worry there was no concern God was in control working in them and they had people have taken notice that they had been with Jesus because they were doing the same things he did and I believe it's time for that to be restored I'm not saying this is that but if it's not that I believe it's coming and I have a reasonable expectation I'll tell you why I'm expecting it in a moment if I don't forget but anyway we went over there and prayed and there were many thoughts going through my mind at that moment and there was a presence of fear no doubt there was a concern there was a I guess the temptation the fear because my baby is not breathing and but nonetheless I shunt that and there was no fear and I just knew simply that God's in control one of the things about the trials we faced we faced a bear of false doctrine early on in our marriage we faced a line of fear with either dying and we faced this Goliath of that tree in our yard lying in a bear and Goliath sounds familiar all these trials have caused us to realize one thing that God is with us and you can think about the trials in your life and recognize God is with you there's one thing you can do too is meditation when these are little things happen there's totally out of the blue a seizure that comes out of nowhere after two and a half years of no seizures and no fever associated with it and then not breathing think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that shall come upon you because you possess the revelation in Jesus Christ all of Hell is against that and will defy that but it can't it can't stand against it so that's what's happening and if you think when these all little things come along just meditate after the fact and think well now I see God's hand here and I see God's hand there and you begin to realize that God was all in that trial when you felt forsaken he was there but anyway we went and laid hands on her and prayed and the predominant thought in my mind all the fear and the confusion and the kids just screaming I said girls just get upstairs they wouldn't stop screaming they were scared to death all that bombarding me but the the prevailing thought in my mind was I've immersed myself in the Word of God for years I should be able to see God cast this demon out of this child I've been on a journey I've come from somewhere not what I want to be not what ought to be but not what it used to be what it used to be was very afraid and I've been running with my girls in fear hide my eyes saying Lord I can't watch masters save us we perish you know like in mark 438 but when Jesus came on the scene in mark 438 when he woke from that in the storm you know the disciples woke him up and said we're perished and we're dying they had seen storms before we had seen this storm before but it was just a little bit different and that was what struck caused that fear to be there to be present there and and she just awoke and calmly rebuked I believe he calmly rebuked you know the winds and the waves and then the disciples for their unbelief Jesus did that on this occasion but through me and Gaby and I believe he's supposed to be here in a mini member body but here's the one thing I want to get to the number one emphasis on a place I know a lot of people this is such a paradox to me a lot of people placed a lot of emphasis on this and their brother Donny Reagan and all these other big name preachers nothing against that but make sure you don't overlook the fivefold ministry that we have here because that's where me and Gaby put our emphasis she stays up till past midnight listening to the five ministers and those brother Forney those that come through here because we count that our responsibility and that the ones that God has sent to us that's the minister ordained to see us through I believe because I'm not at Happy Valley okay nothing whatsoever against listen brother Donnie or anybody but you make sure you're getting what's being preached here because you'll overlook Christ in simplicity because he hides and reveals in simplicity just like they missed him two thousand years ago people that should have seen who he was missed him and we're missing him because he's here in this fivefold ministry you say oh it's just brother Wade he's kind of silly got a silly nature about him but God is using him same thing brother Dale brother Lewis brother Aaron and brother Bob and and that's that's what we feed upon and gabi not and we're seeing manifestation we're seeing signs and and it's not just signs and wonders I mean people even false Christ's will arise and have signs and wonders it's the power I'm talking about the boldness and not being afraid and no one who you have believed there's many other things I could say but I'll stop right there but God bless y'all I think we all have a testimony amen if you're in the word and it's revealed to you you know he's your healer amen and all the other manifestations he comes me for that reason I know that my god is real let's sing it this evening as we change may stand if you'd like to twenty nine spiral

have you stand one more time for the reading of the word appreciate my wife coming down with me and I said and he called me they say man I come with you I was another that my white trash trailer if you got your Bibles I'm thinking reaping to little places in the scripture I'm gonna react to verse 1 through 5 and in every 2nd Timothy 3 and I axed to and I'm gonna start at verse 1 it says when when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place didn't you have two churches holu didn't help that you know there was in one place Holly and suddenly there came a sound from heaven from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and instead of my each of them and they were all they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and there was and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout means out of every nation under heaven so I didn't look like it included everybody for what I'm concerned hello sir let us go to uh first a second Timothy this third chapter and one's read verse from now let me read off verse chapter let me reverse seven and eight it is says for ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth not as jammies and Jamis withstood Moses so do the so these also resist the true means a corrupt mine reprobate concerning the faith let us pray I dressed as far the Lord I understood your service Lord all I can bring to this church is my body finding I trust God that you would take time to go eternal spirit and use it for your glory father gotta give you all my strenght Lord this evening my body sold in my spirit I thought I got use it now Lord speak to your people just evening father and Jesus Christ's name we pray father amen god bless you you may be singing it one moment thank you Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening I'm take my coat off like I always say you can't work a fight with a coat o let me thank the Lord so thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God just eating him little nervous because I'm just just a preferred time I kind of winner you know you get a message and you know you you nerd because you ain't got to tune it up to what you won't do so you just like I told you I say start a new message is like breaking in a horse you just don't know what we're gonna throw you so we just leaders we just kind of have to do put a shell in the gun and yield to God and let him preach hello so I want to thank the Lord for the reading of his word of God this evening and I took from you notice I started from the book of Acts because I want to deal with that for a moment because I believe that people's are getting to a church by how many Oh to the book of Acts so when the table title this evening stop before you cross over into the realm of the book of Acts that's my title stop before you cross over into the realm of the book of Acts now what you don't notice here I begin to look at them playing on the book of Acts in a way why don't we why have this message come to restore how do we know the way I looked at the message itself there is no way for you to look at the message and not see God manifested in the book of Acts oh you said brother Joel you say uh-uh but we got something at that nada we got something that double go back say God yeah we got Edward the book of Acts have what we got here's the baptism that already go he said the message wouldn't work not the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost hallway will be the same how did I begin to realize this but stop be uh stop before you're going to the rim of the book that and I begin to study what what called people not to go all the way and get the Holy Ghost what color if you notice in the in the book of Genesis her when he came into contact with the devil honey what did he preach a he seduced her to take knowledge over the word this is the edge of knowledge Holly this is a Jew ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth hallo everybody know there everybody wanted no quote everybody can quote dementia everybody can talk about the man like the message is not a quote that message is a person it's a book of action manifestation hello begin to live here I'm beginning to think about those things right so I began to realize so evil he came to even he began to topi he seduced in heat Holly went with painted way he took Iman and he got he takes out knowledge all the faith oh she had to do a big guy oh she had to do is accept the word out of accept word how do you in eternal life they were just kept dwelling nobody wouldn't been that song when they never been say won't he be a time how do you because they wouldn't never got old they wouldn't had a peg in their body that song when they never been mentioned but because they took knowledge over the word that was others in this area so now you begin to look at your brother Jule so whatever what we're trying to get back to hello there now we find I heard somewhere we find her is such an age of knowledge help knowledge help took the place or the baptism the Holy Ghost how do we go Satan is able to make you think the more you learn the more you got Holly buddy if you don't get born again honey even where you didn't come to learn God you come to live him honey hey were you to come here you come show Christ to be revealed in you Holly Jesus and these were Saint John 14 and 12 in that day you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I are you and where he said that day is this day right here how do we didn't come to church how do we come to chirping oh we want God how do them manifest himself how do not just above me not just beside me but in me and is it so I'm beginning to look at them things right so we begin to realize so we took it we are taking knowledge in everywhere so we got to realize your table one faith how many times you preach I don't care what title you put on this message it ain't but one faith either one Peru John 739 returned enable one safe you can put any tighter you won't you own this message what were you borrowed it down it's one thing and one Lord it one baptism with you all just in you all how did to the end of the world how do you cannot change that one thing so that we begin to realize it you said what brother Joe so we got a different message in India there yeah we got yeah what God come to do he come to shores what we come from with what we a in what we go I'll do that word does nobody come to do the revelation to this message did not come to preach another message it come to me that they we did not understand to open I understand there so we can understand what we a who are we going to do when you get the final revelation you didn't realize I come from God and going back to God hallelujah Edward that when you was in the first place so I began to look at him place right there and the soup rotation the Prophet says so everything always been from the time Adam turn now into the terminal and the Moses time it always did why didn't they cross over into the promised land in the Tavor boy why did they wander in the wilderness people like Balaam begin to teach knowledge stead of faith you got over here why didn't they cross over when Jesus came on the scene why didn't they cross over and receive Jesus the word except you believe over here you're dying you're saying why connect save receive it because of their traditions in the word them guys had some truth they've guys had a lot of truth they can prove that natural genealogy they came from a by him holiday knew what it was hey they say and were with Jesus let her head away we're not in bondage to know me Abraham is our Father do you realize they knew that they was not smoking pot they were not drinking but was they were good really religious people that knew the law to the dot so Regina came on the scene they were full of knowledge but we ain't told my no we told my revelation he didn't come to talk to their now they couldn't reveal who he was so now here they was so they tell each either they do first thing if you were one read it I'm gonna go kind of cookie to say to her Holly ain't neither even just say John 833 all the way down to 43 and it just keep getting more and more but here they were they telling Jesus who they were saying we're not in bondage to no man dare we Abraham see and we can prove it we can prove it we don't study this thing Jesus you don't come trying to kill her who we are we got this thing figured out of prayer but had you met him over here 18 inches all it takes heli so any if you notice here so here they go they telling Jesus these things right here honey then they finally come to the girl who did Jesus say if you wouldn't know Abraham you wouldn't new me believe me go Abraham we're preaching about me have you with a new Abraham a new what he does you would have been looking at the world and you want to see that Joshua type me they never go to Joshua if you notice it when they're getting their books they never coded according Moses they go to neighbor why didn't they quote Joshua they never cross over they never seen what God did on this day the wandering around in the wilderness and only to say I thought had manna in the wilderness and Jesus sitting there one of them did honey I didn't want to understand the world of eat manna I want you to cross over and receive the bat-signal or you go I want you to eat the old corner leg so we begin to look at these things here you know that's what it is today so we begin to realize her so that we begin to think of no things because this revelation did not come that keep us in a neutral position you know just been a good church person how are you just going to turn off I never done nobody wrong I never stole I'd never steal so what I was in the message that don't mean nothing are you in Christ are you read are you in the Christ that doesn't I mean this look here don't you - no sister now I want to this take a thought about we talk about knowledge for a minute now I don't support English you know when say I mean Ignotus areas or brother I'm so I'm so humble I brought me O'Connor burned 20 cups of 20 quarts are all that humility let's do pitted it's not humbled by burning twitting football 20 quads are all to get to church it's done hum about that honey so you know people take humility and try to pay stupidity with humility but we told Matt we're not talking about that we talk about Christ we come at this word limiting you it's time to quit playing with the message people don't talk of this visit we got more more in Revelation in the preacher we got more fights now and we ever had how do you what it is because what did it brother and said why appeal while my somewhat fussing and fighting over a message ain't over the Revelator he say it's the lack of Revelation if you know who you is you got nothing to prove to nobody you don't have to going shout and jump on your hair to prove you got to only go you just keep walking your life at testify you got the Holy Ghost so we were getting to realize okay you know you know like I told mother dancing you know this knowledge it's gonna become so real come people says now have tapped into more knowledge and helped me anything you can know everything now brother Sam can't hear me nothing who told you do you got a divine gift that God called you to preach the gospel even the women can preach now ya know Sammy row right there who told you to reach holy to God give you a divine gift to preach the gospel how do you not you in the role play that way you find so many people falling away cost you out of place when David got out of place he felt this way it is today so you know you said bridge or you know what gifts and callings are predestinated by God how do you need you know I don't understand him do you need a prayer to God open my understanding if he preaching me to divine revelation God crisis start revealing himself not around me but in me so beginning to do looking at the things so I really realized here Satan job is the by pat get you to bypass the book of Acts you know about a pass and away with you traveling the ROI when you they got a roadblock they all we have a bypass what time I got on the bypass route it took me 35 miles out of the way but it was a bad pass I seen places I didn't even thought existed in North Carolina sucker laughs but it was about morale but you know was there and they were saying that was Satan done he took the book of knowledge and challenged the book of Revelation so now you said brother how you get there some people I want you to see her understand the mysteries it's not since you got the Holy Ghost that mean that you have got the ability to gain knowledge and understand let me see what Paul says here let us feel I think I'll just read this one first Corinthians 13 verse 1 watch out what Paul say Satan is using this technique to actually turn your mind you think I got all this not man I understand the mystery nobody can tell me nothin holiday you hate I'm deeper than the pastor yeah you might be deeper but what direction you go man 1st Corinthians 13 and verse 1 Paul begin to do with this deal with this thought record now I want you to know that on the day of Pentecost they spoke with tongues but they spoke in a language they everybody understood people the old brother but Paul doma and Janice me though I speak with tongues man godspeed would turn a man in angel and have not charity I become as a sounding brass and a tweet lism that was a sound that come from heaven like a Russian buddy weird but it had a voice behind it it had a message behind it that sound was just not a bunch of ride away don't know if I'll ever trumpet give an uncertain sound how can you prepare for battle it had a message with it and then he says and then he goes oh dear ball begin the speaker and even though I have the gift of prophecy and understand what we need to stop on it we're right there that what bit the people didn't trouble we got so much mysteries now we don't need God to tell us nothing Eve got so Revelator she didn't need God to tell her what address she didn't need God to tell her what to do hey all she could say God he said you could be as God you don't need God to tell you you got your own independent man you got what here you are just like God II he misses write her it's not be mistress do not become flesh you got a problem if the mistress is in your mind ain't not in your heart you got a problem honey one catalyst how'd it go remember her knowledge puffeth up but revelation humbles so understanding missing will you understand something you feel like man I mean you know where we go to churches today I preaches invasion I've been everywhere and I'm not sure about I do not go to try to out preacher me because I feel like everybody on Gill I can't be brother saying me him free to get into mayhem free to get in Jamaica there that we had some good means he he did to teach it and then I just come back and put the fire behind it I felt myself I say here to teach it now he put the I prefer a full of gasoline only me was a match so that we don't know we did we had a good daddy we Brazil holy so that no one is other hit one man ministry is the winner bill over each other not put each other down but see the day wider mystery become such a battle why he comes think about it I judge came fellowship with destroy or we don't sell my family they see it a little different for me where did they see a little bit let me ask you one question had you prayed how do you God whatever this is maybe maybe because anything to make us feel a little different it ain't God that's moving highly the word and nowhere did say then when we come together in other word to the preaching of the word how do we come together one day you look at it normally you said the same thing you're just using a different phrase and you know you know we need to talk about the Neuberger years ago how you say - so you scared somebody to do but when you got to really talking to the people long time they saying the same thing but they needs got a terminology they're using but I'm going to look at it we don't want to get in that right here because I realize if you get the right nature you only right he's understanding old mystery and Oh what how can you have all this and not have the Holy Ghost you've got all the knowledge you got all the mysteries and everything is going in your favor and oh hell oh I got knowledge I got mystery I got faith and all these dangers without the Holy Ghost in you and satanic it's satanic honey SoDo I could know face so that I could remove mountains and have not I am not dead and then a word did he hug her and when you say brother I go fight I give everything I got to the poor I gotta miss you he it's alright to do all of it but make sure it done by the popular Holy Ghost Paul say though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and and though I give my body to be burned but that's the sacrifice oh that is a real sacrifice oh I'm gonna give my body to be burned but you better make sure you got the whole ego when you do it cuz you don't you just committed suicide in a wish be burned and have not charity it profiteth did he go to anyhow to charity loads over in New York aldetha so we begin to look at this is what Satan is using now keep the people out of the book of Acts this is what he used he used and he using knowledge to get the people people to bypass the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what the problem being in especially he using it now what you realized her this message if it ever puffs up another but you're gonna run another book of Acts behind it that word and come on day use a Queen of Sheba he's a Christ in heaven Christ in every church will write a book of Acts behind it that's exactly right because the first one wrote a book of Acts behind it so dirt dirt there you are so he began to brainy st. they were right away why he kept going back to the book of Acts let me read of in the church a book this is I brought a tell he brought down a church their book Satan hates he hate this book of Acts he hate but he was because he know if you get to genuine power to God in you he got the lead hallory not only did he leave you he leave everybody you come in contact with honey we go God you come with this message was not guilt give it to you to play with the devil it was given to you to take authority on a demonic power that what God put it in you Pilate oh brother what like that brother I heard

home honey he hit when she was not ready here he got a ride into the home God don't make no mistakes Satan hate this book right here they being this riddle quotation here because I believe here that brother Brandon was not Jesus Christ so you got to get that out of your mind he was only revealed he was only a messenger to reveal who he was he was only the best man to introduce you huh when I goes when you go to a wedding no way dr. bride ain't looking at the best man maybe a problem she do would that be a bad thing you go to get married and you standing up there waiting on and she grabbed the best man that bill I mean I anyone think about this but that what he was come to do he come he come to reveal Jesus Christ hallelujah in other words so now well when I get you see what we going in a minute but then he goes here in this was one of the most powerful statement in the whole church a book for them concerned when he wrote out of the out of church a book on page 15 when he began to talk about when he begin to talk about Satan in the book of Revelation and the book of Genesis but watch how you put this on a church a book page 15 and I'll be 15 at the middle of it and down to a little portion of 16 it says not let me show you another reason why Satan hate doubles of Revelation real Revelation calls Satan a problem karev elation is our uncovering it reveals and brain light I lived in Satan can't stay in light hi Louie don't work when you show light on a roach he leaves you got a light on a roach it up and it would like comfort exposed everything that is not of God police it him

fig they get up Holly he's a now let's read it now had to scream I he said he they let me show you or never read white shaded say hey double the revelation of the book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church who in the church Jesus Christ he'll do what is the message Jesus Christ who in the resurrection Jesus Christ he says Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the what there was any new one show me how you change Jesus Christ how can you change this revelation that suit you he says he changed nothing he knows that a hot death a whole lot more than 90% of the theologians he knows that God he knows that since God is necessary mutable in his nature then he he is just as immutable and in his way Satan knows surely that the riddler church we're trying to keep we're always trying to stay away from there all brother Joe the church's print ago we're going backwards show me how you pin across go backwards you show me help integral the life with Gina quite literally you

st. underbody shipment saying anybody I go to telling that called a real bad bro nah she won't even go around the back of the house no more she used to help me to cut the grass but she saying going back there baby I don't know I got on there but it's the truth anyway but everything's dead out such as went to the doctor last Thursday and he gave me mother I thought my report he says she's doctors she said he says it was a she I don't know duty look guys they act Allah to me ain't got no magic a have no God can act in that way anything but anyway she said she said I am amazed she said yo top nummer come down to 122 and she's your bottom number is 80 as a prayer hello what I'm not I will keep invested I will keep thank you God for my healing I'm not siding for no round snakes hardly by his growing up here how do you learn where you say brother joy my wife with Dave will land for you - hello - mm fight me and they will be trying to tell me he that you got arising is all I did that were you telling a lie I keep trying to raise my god gray I'm not signing for operatic one sign I don't need a lot it might have some banner he's a powerless it exposed Satan it revealed his it revealed his word attempted disgusted of God peoples and discredit of God word right down to the entire with what knowledge everywhere not in the Pentecostal message today yesterday going by do you realize the devil scripting you because now you pushing the weight of everything that God giving you to get rid of how do you say well I brother I mean we in Purusha we don't believe that God do nothing I ain't no God they don't do nothing I need I need a god I need a God was skiing on the bridge god Zoe and there was anything in the world right down to the end he - he cast into the lake of fire he fight that he cannot stand it he know give the people get their true revelation of the true church it'll be the same book of Acts in a rape of the same power in a brave will to say only those in a cast out del ni geodesy and Italy all right amen president this one right here that's what his little brother keep running like that believe it was he said the true revelation a true church and what shield and what she stand for that she can't do the greater work she can do the greater word holy is more than that therefore how do you have to deal with one but now you gotta deal with thousands of how over the world she could do the greater words he says she will be it's the word I want to use an invincible army and visibly uncomfortable saying can't cover you you are more than conquers honey if you get the true revelation that Christ is in you to over Lori you are more than a conqueror say they cannot conquer you you might get in a violent but you'll pick yourself back up that the power God put in the church thank God I didn't know how this is gonna come out but God it seemed like he wanna preach this baby come on nurse been to a ball day but now what the problem is just don't get relaxed just because you come to the message or you feel a call to come because if you do that need you don't find that Judas was the same way Judas didn't only come to the message 272 of the church but Judas shared the knowledge of the mystery he walked with the words behind skin he cast out Devils in Jesus name but he was born of the Spirit because he did not go all the way to Pentecost saving technology and stop Judas before he got the Pentecost right knowledge of reasoning trying to force Jesus to do something I said Jesus out here raised up his short power Jesus didn't come to fight him he didn't come to build on me he come to give his life that's right brother come give his life so they give me a few more minutes I pressure you nervous so buddy why would you to realize her so that's why Satan today he's building he's building programs even the message got programs I preached that be heroes to go in a church and I preached angle come to me but a a preaching they come hand me a program wait that's the last that you hand me cuz I don't even know how to act I'm thinking how did you make this program work you can follow these guidelines you follow this by the time I got through I ain't seen the program I forgot they gave it to me I mean you can't program God it never ever existed that was been wrong with the church today too many programs how they too many in let your call Holly brother Humes told me something for he died I want you to listen it yes want you to think about this but human told me something before he died he said brother death brought to him daddy in adoption book all man brother humans they have to be almost 90 years old he passed on my fifty years old on my birthday and he passed and I'm being 57 so he'd been dead about seven years now I've been 57 in Wow anyone think about it birthday used to feel good she just how young man think he said god bless you oh yeah you know but he said this he said people spread he say he used to go to meetings and he used to let me tell you how old brother he was wrong by the way he went to school with Jack Oh him and Jack Cole was buddies in in Bible School fellas are you gonna he follow every revolver he follow Jack Cole he know told oh he told he would tell me and he he say you see so many miracle I said let me ask you one question then if you saw miracle it's such a way that someone's seen dioxyde brother Brendan how do you know you the true prophet that was the question that accent because he told me the mirror he said brother I see miracles that some it even looked open miracle it seemed to be more supernatural than what brother Brendan was doing and I'm thinking wouldn't that trouble your mind to I said then how you would you know brother Brendan was different from the rest him he said the truth of the matter was he said it was not the miracles that vindicated brother Brian he said it was the discernment Halu he said when it come down to the discernment could not at all guys hit the whole time they were here to miss one her and he's about that probably gonna go back to the tower and reveal what they done wide in the condition is not up gonna do that thank God he done worse praise God I don't know me but I don't let you know this God is you know he said people didn't want me to say that but I do he said a used to prayer and he would come to me he said he will fast a whole week that you preaches prayer in fast car we're gonna choose by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're gonna choose by the baptism there we go he said brother fast are we I prayed I would God give me a dynamic message to preach he said but when I get to the message and I get to the church I'm gonna beat her and the pastor say I'm gonna pick him out a lead shipper the whole ego he always picked the war they had the prestige he already picked the one that can bring in the money he never picked one preacher that was a nobody I've been living in North Carolina I've been preaching for 31 years only preached one meeting in North Carolina well poverty money with its own down one meeting in the whole state of North Carolina every one of my meetings been all over the web with nook Allah yuxuan come back you don't come back but see we're saying for everybody prayer know it ain't nothing but knowledge it is meant for popularity and money and trying to build something but if we get down to get with God book of I said hell no Spectre person that need to do god hallelujah troop anyway so I'm going to get rid of our shooter but I'm gonna say T place because I'm richer Allah Judah share the knowledge of the mystery all of them did but I want you to notice here that the probably got here things he said and then he goes back here and he reads I'm gonna just read a quota to so we could kind of see why I say what I'm saying he said looking at the unseen he said Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branch he said in divine birth the fruit of the first branch and the first branch was Pentecost same but see if you don't go back to pinnacle you gotta change the life that's in the back you don't see if you don't go back and do the same you say Brent you I'm not trying to put you in the minute now if we got to hell what Paul preach brother Bradley could not leave Paul teaches if he would he had to add to the scripture Paul did not Paul went to a for his God would care he's a prayer that God will open to me adore utterance that I may understand God said no it's not for you to do I guess somebody is confused but Paul wanted to go for this he went further so what did he do he did not show he laid a foundation it was a foundation I have written a book God will open the door then the father who step right here that be the one to open this door it was Christ and open the door revelation did was it was Christ come down he put his head feet on the land it won't be known to see and it's whoa only God could have done it but then you say would it was Christ coming down but how do you need reveal himself only one way you can reveal himself Luana three and seven baby don't do you man went through the whole Bible way and what Jesus could come on over to John was on earth hello he had to be in all with the scripture how did John had to be boys six month before g-good car would never come it wouldn't it never be no Savior because the world all wake up to the prophets he says he said with Pentecost and the blessings is recorded in and the blessings is recorded in the book of Acts and if that first bridge was pinnacles the branch will have to be pinnacle and it have to burn the same type of a church and behavioral and the first bridge breath it's the same Holy Ghost but I'm not trying to come and change us back to something that the probably didn't preach how do you probably preach the message he preached as far as God would permit him to go and he did it in a revelation because he said this is it for me he said this is ever me I will admit this revelation right here I'd encourage you for that I could go it's up to him to take you on over here I'm a deep tree come to low degree and he must agree he the one gonna become popular you notice in the book of Acts when they got in the book of Acts was John decrease he never was talked about much in the book of Acts they went back to Moses in every walk because their God were talking about Jesus do that what he was coming to do but he never really mentioned him much in the book of that but because Jeremy's read agree Christ was increasing how he became your automa nobody around don't preach that name of Jesus and it won't that name preach everything they called the devil the problem when that name taken was flesh there's a problem with the devil how do when you begin to speak that name by the revelation that devil got probably dead name hallelujah let me just say this and get rid of pursuit right here everyman God born again and his sins and his sinful nature was killed in him that that is that is in the message it was not so from the beginning and this sinful nature was killed in him and a new man being born in him which is Christ which is Christ Jesus he said the Son of God then you didn't use surrender yourself completely to Christ and Christ come in and write a book of Acts God what is the book it's no more than to act up the Holy Ghost into people I leave any and through through you and through you how I know that it's the true oh my friend how I know it's the truth musicians come the book of Acts the book of the Holy Spirit hello people we meet what's wrong today too much theology don't been producing the message that people can't reach out with faith and accept God for nothing no more because everybody got to have a solution some some reason for it to happen if I can figure it out I could believe it well as lot of things you ain't figured out yet like the proper God say I can't figure out how can a cow eat green grass your white milk and turn yellow but if I can't figure that out they don't matter I came flicker out when they typically don't prove that a bum became fly but we only got one problem with the bumblebee flying he just don't know what he don't know he can fly and said he don't know he gave like Holly that was wrong we know too much how did why not believe God all things are possible to them that believe not nothing nothing that we video I just accept God it his word he said brother Jul God has not come to rehab people's this message is not a rehab where life will always be that way my grandmother had this disease and and I'm going to have the same problem you know when I went to the doctor they read everything mama hat they let me tell you your mama had just seen your mama head and your mom and I said well I'm sorry doc I ain't got none of that I get me the 7s up honey it's happening change she might accept me but I'm not accepting it honey by inscribing meal his words said uphill and I believe he said his word and his word heal me why not take God in His Word hallelujah they said that so in a few minutes open the eyes of my heart Lord that's what we need lord I just ask God to help us all church oh I just tell the people I'll see you know turn them a couple of weeks ago outside quit preaching he was looking at me like what he done doing as I just quit preaching I said it took me thirty one years to realize get out of God way so he could preach 31 years I realize I'm in his way I blow fuses trying to put things again it didn't work right he think you don't worry about you just get out of the way I know what I wanted to do with my word that God take over church whatever you do worse to be you do it all in the name of Jesus cry sister Lewis how many know sister Brenda Lewis regime sister Lewis told me something one time I'm always going to never forget it I'm sitting that she said brother Joe she said when she said when I saying she said I had never sung a song to please the peoples see I'm thinking what's she saying she

I'd ever be whatever anybody says how are you doing I'm doing wonderful why because it's always been my testimony in the physical exam on my lungs they've always said that I had extra large lungs after redo an x-ray where a normal lung comes in a normal x-ray they'd have to pull the x-ray higher one person told me said well yes God knew you'd need them do you preach it always had extra-large lungs never had any shortness of breath I'm supposed to be basically an invalid because of my life and all the way back now the gods always took care of me he's always been there that way I don't tell everything because what held you know you sell how you doing I'm doing wonderful all right about a year ago little over it I started a problem I'd be short of breath the doctor says you're you shorted Ralph I said no I said cause I'm 77 years old I said what am I supposed to be but I wouldn't tell them the truth I told no one the truth I'd go hutton last year just a little upgrade to walking nothing just a small amount I'd have to stop couldn't make it to the dears time I'd go down and during the middle of the night I just wake up and just breath gone I do that at home my wife will tell you I still do it I'm up five six seven times or not walking through the house praying because that's just always been me I just I can't sleep so why they invaded I'll wake up I wake up the half that my breath would be totally gone you just like it I can't breathe even just have to stop and get bringing there never been anything yet to get where I couldn't go never would tell nobody cuz why oh tell him pray for me yeah I always tell my wife knows I've never talked to her about this the other day I mentioned it that I had had trouble last year and all from last year up and you know I'm just when we went up to the camp Father's Day meeting I had two spells there during the night I had to get up and one night I would just within my whole being was screaming get weighed get out of here and get to the doctor I just said well that'd be good cuz that's the way I've always been I'm scared aren't you afraid no I'm not scared I'm not afraid of dying God took that away a long time ago I said I can call em I can get them they'll run her to the hospital uh pray for me the Lord you said you'd take care of me you through with me then fine okay I'm ready but don't let it go on no record that I come down to be a weakling and and would not be strong in my faith to stand on my own the next night it come again that's why I told him they they know what did I tell you I said I'll stay in here I said I can't sleep me wait wanted me to sleep in the bed in there I said no I'll stay right here on this couch I said because I'll be up in the night I'll be up a half a dozen times ever not I pray for you now walk through the house and pray for me it just kept bothering me and bothered me sitting there the other day and I use these no sprays and inhalers and everything else that they've given me from the doctors I try to do what his brother when he said do what the doctor said and I just took a real deep breath with the nose spray I just held it in it just cleared out everything no short breath no nothing this is because I just stood on the word that's always been me right everybody's been here with me so maybe 40 50 years you know well enough to that's it I just stand on my own I'm just that away I'm done I'm not made to work that I have to find somebody else to be able to follow that point I've always been one to stay and stand my own two feet but God took it away yeah and I thank you for thank God because I have no trouble breathing I have no problem things I'm 78 years old I can still do pretty good but you see it didn't do it until Monday not Monday night this week they believe God I've always just tried to get you for one thing Church right I've always forget you to stand on your own faith rather on see it's wonderful to call brother Dale get brother Dale we're here we need you ok praise God let stand on your own two feet stand on your own experience with God and just hold it right there because in that way you don't have faith after have faith in nothing but Jesus Christ and him alive and living in you the Prophet never tried to get anybody to see who he was he tried to get us to see who Jesus Christ is and worst Jesus Christ today in his bride look at the world and what's coming forwards and what's happening and you'll see Christ amen thank you because I know you have a lot of you've seen me in different things and you pray for me I thank you for it I'm glad for that I pray for you and you call me I pray we that's fine but somewhere you gonna stand on your own two feet one day and you're gonna find out whether you got the faith or not when that old devil comes and he's right there with you and he's gotcha ain't nothing you can do you just turn around look at him and grin and say the Lord is already took care of this so if it's my time I'll just go on and forget it you help everybody else see I just hadn't told nobody I've always been that way I don't tell you when something bothers me but I don't tell you a lot of times when God reveals something through me you know I've told you about it I don't do it because you get built on something of trying to build on the man no we don't get built on a man we're built on Jesus Christ he's the man stand on your own two feet cuz it's not gonna be my rapture and faith that takes you in it's gonna be yours right just make sure you tell her brother how much we appreciate it appreciate
