morning let's just prepare to go into the word and look at matthew chapter 7. it's good to be here this morning thank the lord for all he's done for us there's uh i know there's just kind of talking about some things that the lord's been doing as we um uh you know or having to stay at home and go through all these kind of rough times but i believe the lord's doing some some things for us in in private and and uh really working some miracles and you can really see the handle of the lord and in our life in many many situations so we just thank the lord for for moving for us and for always being there with us he's still he's still with his bride well let's just uh let's just prepare to look at matthew chapter 7 and and then we'll go to the lord in prayer we thank you lord god for your

and be with the services today be with brother dale and brother wade up there lord with brother jewel and just be with your bride all around the world we ask and and pray in your name amen so uh the the sermon that i i kind of been meditating on and and you know i know i use that word meditate a lot but when i say that i mean i i think about it i roll it around my head i ponder and uh lately i i i think my whole family's just kind of been listening to the anointed ones at the end time trying not to get all leaky up here but uh you know when i when i go to bed at night i i hear my wife playing that sermon and and i think my my son has been listening to it a lot and and i i've listened to it several times and uh i i think it's it's one of those things you know when when brother brian when he would preach sermons a lot of times uh a lot a lot of times we kind of go to church and we expect the sermon to be real uplifting and kind of tell us how good we are and everything but when brother brown would break a sermon down many times like this or things like souls in prison now convinced and concerned it's it's really to kind of get you thinking and get you concerned to inspect yourself so maybe think about think about that as we as we read the scripture and kind of get into the lesson here is is where are we at spiritually where are you at right in matthew chapter 7 verse 20 says or 19 says every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them now that's a big question and what what other fruits that's even in the message today what that's a big question about what kind of fruits are we supposed to be looking for not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth amen but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven now how you supposed to know the will many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then while i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity you may be seated the lord has blessing to the reading of the word so i i like i said i'm really preaching this from the anointed ones at the end time but i wanted to title the sermon this morning workers of iniquity because i think you know that if you really kind of inspect the sermon that brother brown was talking about he's he's getting into what iniquity is and and kind of highlighting that that there are people that are working iniquity and they don't even really realize that they are workers of iniquity and and and i i think many times in the past um i preached this before that many times in the past when you preach sermons like this people kind of get in their head that it will give you this is supposed to give you power to point fingers at other people and to kind of inspect other people but that's not the intention of these kind of sermons at all is to inspect ourselves and you know i i believe that the only ones at the end time that sermon if you go back and listen to it it really if you begin to realize that iniquity has been purged from your life and that you are walking in the word it will give the bride the revelation power in your life to know that you are escaping the things of this world so it really has the word goes forth and it cuts and it divides and it chops and it does it does two things it can it condemns and it saves it sets apart it separates it puts people in in right where they're supposed to be so to one it might be really uh you know you begin to say oh me and the other maybe you you begin to build confidence that you're maybe doing like enoch walking with the word enoch walked with god and was found not he just kept walking and walking and walking until finally he escaped the bounds of the earth he walked off the earth so let's think about this now this scripture that we just read and maybe just kind of teach this a little bit more and just kind of just kind of mull over some things iniquity he said depart from me ye that work iniquity then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so these people coming to the white throne judgment coming up they they thought they that they were fine that they were okay they're going to think that they're fine even even today in this age especially in this age because brother branham said this would be a sign of the end time that the deception would be so close have we not prophesied in thy name we've prophesied we've declared we preached on your behalf we've done all these things we've been in we've gone to church we've now see this is not talking about people out in the world living on uh you know living in sin these these are church people have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils my goodness casting out devils and still jesus would say depart from me i never knew you and in thy name done many wonderful works done many wonderful works in the name of jesus christ that depart from me i never knew you what what kind of a person would that be that would work iniquity now you want to find out what it means to work iniquity first you got to find out what iniquity is and if you go to look up in the dictionary it says iniquity is unrighteousness to transgress the law the condition of without law either because ignorant of it or because violating it and brother brown said in the message the anointed ones at the end time he said what is iniquity ask somebody it's something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it so so let's think about that now let's see the bible is the way that we know what to do and the way that we should walk so when it's presented in front of you and it's put right in front of you that you should do certain things that you should dress a certain way that you should go to church that you should all these things adding on up holding down time holding down as the word becomes revealed and you turn your back on and walk away then that becomes iniquity and he said they know that word they hear it you're listening to this tape my that narrows it down doesn't it see that that brings it on down from not just denominational people but message people they're listening to that you're listening to this tape you're listening to this message you see the lord god say so you see him confirm it make it true and you know this just as plain as the sun is shining outside but you that'll hold on to your denomination hold on to those false things you worker of iniquity now maybe in this message this morning we'll just kind of hone that down because i i will kind of get into what a denomination is but you can have your own little denomination sitting there because you're still holding on to the past well i heard this this brother preached this years ago and i i know it's right even though it's contrary to the word i heard this so-and-so somebody when i came out of the denomination this is what they believe but i'm not going to let that go i'm just hanging on to it despite the truth that has been laid in front of you that you know is true that's right now now iniquity is a very important bible concept it's so important it just goes all brother brown talked about it if you read the mystery the first seal when he preached the first seal the mystery of iniquity was a very important part of part of that when the first seal is open it reveals to you that iniquity is gone the the writers got a bow and no errors he he can say all kinds of stuff but if iniquity's gone from you if iniquity has been purged from your soul and is not there anymore what can the devil say to you well you don't you got iniquity no because but you got to know you got to know it can't be just because the preacher tells you that iniquity's purged it's got to be because it's revealed to you personally personally to you that you know not because somebody's come and pat you on the back or because you sit in the message but because you know it's so important that it was it was mentioned in daniel's 70 weeks it's part of the six-fold purpose and i think that's uh you know if you really would meditate on the six-fold purpose and what that really is to the jews and how because it says to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity now what was their iniquity they saw the truth presented right in front of them and they killed him on the cross and they turned around and walked it so there's got to be reconciliation for iniquity and brother branham said that you can't make reconciliations yourself you can't make reconciliation for yourself he said because reconciliation has already been made you just gotta recognize it right he said it's a confession that you're wrong and then come and straighten up now now see there you see the reason why so many walk in iniquity is because they are unwilling to recognize and just admit that they are wrong just to admit you're wrong now that's why it's going to take two prophets to come to israel and preach a word preach this message to them and then they will recognize as brother wade's been preaching on the day of atonement they'll recognize that they're wrong and that's what the word the preaching of the word is supposed to do to us in this hour is to open our eyes that we're wrong that we're wrong to the way that we've been living the wrong to the way that we've been doing wrong to the way see you you've got to hear the word if you close your eyes and ears to the word and you stay home and don't come to church or don't listen to the tapes when you're at home and don't spend time meditating then how you know what the will of god is how will you know what iniquity is so brother branham uh as you kind of follow through this this message he begins to talk about matthew chapter 24 which is what he's really preaching on here in the in the sermon he said for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now that's something to really kind of ponder on why will it not deceive the very elect what will be the deception what will it look like when it's so close to the truth and i think almost sometimes it gives people kind of nervous frustration you you we know that there's going to be a deception come there's going to be something come and we're looking for that but you know the the antidote to that and the antidote to the deception is to just get in the word god will take care of it get in the word and feast on the word and you will not be deceived and he pointed out that there shall arise false christs and false prophets now a false christ brother pointed out that he didn't say false jesus because nobody's going to come around and say i'm jesus but to come around and say that i have the truth that is the deception and so that's why an anointed one is one with a message they're anointed they're anointed but their truth is is not in them now now let's pause right there and kind of think about that and that the reason brother branham brought out to us that you're made up kind of of a you're a threefold being you've got a body a spirit and a soul now now we want to make just kind of paint a picture a little bit that your soul is is way down deep under the surface of the water and i think i've used this illustration in the past your soul is what you can't really see it's way down there and it's what's guiding you now you we see our body it's got five five senses see taste feel here smell all of those things and that's how we interact with one another and then your spirit realm is how we we show affection to one another we imagine things we mem we memorize things we we think in that realm but way down under that under the current under the water is the thing that's really guiding you it's the thing that's really motivating you so if you're anointed on your flesh or in your spirit it feels good it gives you a sensation but if your soul is not changed if that thing down on the inside that's that that's really guiding you that's moving you from here to there moving you in the right direction if that's not changed your innermost being will be going in the wrong direction so you can make anointed in those realms but your teaching will be wrong that's why brother brown said the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save souls that gives them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit that same spirit is falling on the just and the unjust and brother adam said that that that is a sign of the end that in this time as we get closer to the end of this message he talked about janice and jammers and how as janice and jammers come on the scene it corresponds it comes on the scene parallel with the manifestation of the son of man now when the son of man is revealed in this last day then parallel to that you have a deception that will come on the scene as well this deception of false christs and false prophets something that has never been manifested in this way down through all of the seven church ages this deception will be a greater deception that has ever been and he said this is a sign of the end and he preached these sermons and gave us these truths he said so the elect would not be confused so that you would know the truth so with you would be able to inspect yourself and be able to tell whether you're right or not he said now if this sign is only to be known at the end time then it'll have to be after the opening of those seals see it's a sign of the end that would be when these things happens it'll be at the end time and it'll be a sign now so the elected will not be confused in these things you see it then it's got to be revealed exposed now now brother brown said what would make a man want to be a false teacher of something that's truth why would why would a man see there's the deception as people think that they're right so what would what would somebody want to deviate from the truth he said now we'll get down to the mark of the beast in a few minutes and you'll see it's denomination so let's let's think about what the nomination is for a second i'm gonna just take my time this morning i hope i hope it's not boring anybody or anything a denomination is when you take part of the whole so a denomination method just have some truth the baptists have a little truth even catholics have a little bit of truth every denomination has a part of the truth and brother branham said in one one illustration he gave it said it's like somebody's saying what kind of ice cream do you like and that one person would say i like chocolate ice cream in other words the truth of the methodists i like vanilla ice cream in other words maybe the truth of the baptist and everybody has a favorite ice cream but if you can see the whole rainbow it's not just a denomination here a little bit of truth over here a little bit of truth over there but this message of the hour was given to give us a complete picture of the entire bible the whole rainbow the seven color facet rainbow so that you don't say well well we're going to just major on on a theology and we but we don't believe in signs and wonders oh we believe in the supernatural working of the spirit but we don't really want to get into the mechanics so much or you don't you know you don't focus just on one thing but you can see the entire picture unfold and you see that's how a little people get kind of sometimes we get off track by by thinking that these sermons that brother brandon preached daniel 70 weeks and the statue of a perfect man and all these different sermons kind of fall in different buckets but they're painting one glorious picture a tapestry of the whole thing that we can see so brother braham said we're all born of the same spirit denomination is only taste it's all ice cream it's all spirit of god and you know what a rainbow makes a covenant let's stay this way brother let's see stacy a rainbow covenant but you see if you only take one of those little parts of the picture the methodist or the baptist or the catholic and you plant it in the ground it will produce a methodist harvest but if you can take the original seed and plant that into the ground it will produce an original seed doc the original seed back again that's why brother ryan said the church baptist will produce baptists methodists will produce methodists but the church will produce christ from the root the word from the root yes because it's going all the way back to the root that brother louise was bringing out wednesday the genesis 1 26 27 root because when you get the when you get the baptism in holy ghost in your soul it connects you back all the way back to the root to the original seed the original seed of god's thinking that you were going to come into the world one day and receive the truth and he would put his own life in you but you see that these two vines the true and the false vine grow up together by the same water but what's planted what's planted is going to come up and then you can tell what it is if you plant an orange seed when it comes up you can tell they said orange seed because of the fruit because of the fruit and by their fruits you shall know them by their fruits so the question is what is the fruit what is your fruit now a lot of people you know they kind of get in their own ideas instead of taking it back to the message but the message has the answer to what the fruit is right now is the fruit we know the bible says that the fruit is love the fruits of the spirit of love joy peace long suffering all those things but where does it come from it comes from the seed of the word planted within you and then when it bears forth fruit when it comes forth you'll be able to harvest the thing that was planted in other words you'll be able to harvest the doctrine that was planted in your soul you'll be able and how do you harvest it when you go up and talk to somebody maybe an old saintly grandma on her rocking chair on her front porch and you begin to ask her is there something that i have to do to be saved and she says jesus paid the price it's not by works it's by grace it's by faith grace through faith that you're saved and then the blood will keep you safe you see then you can you're going up to her and that little saintly grandma whoever it might be and you're picking fruit off of that tree because she's bearing forth fruit and what is her fruit her fruit is her doctrine because the doctrine will produce the thing that how can anybody not be excited the doctrine that is planted will bear forth you see if you plant the original seed it will come up and then somebody can glean the benefit from that if you plant the truth then up from that up from that ground up from your earth will come all of these virtues that program said are required virtue and knowledge and temperance and somebody could come up to you and pick from you the knowledge that you have of jesus christ the revelation that you have of who he is now that is how you tell the real fruit not because they saw a light or because they had a sensation or something now those things will follow you can't help for but signs and wonders to follow the word let me let me just kind of hit that a little bit because when the word is planted and it comes up signs and wonders will follow the word do you know if you go back and listen to the sermon christ the mystery god revealed which is a fantastic sermon i believe that's kind of what what brother dale's been hitting on in the morning the the revealing of this mystery well there's a there's a paragraph in there where brother ram said in the last days he's talking about the the palm warren king worm caterpillar locust ate down the word but in the last days all of that would be restored and he said he hit that signs and wonders would be restored so if the word is restored in this last day signs and wonders will be restored also so don't ever get it in your head that now we've got the theology so we don't expect signs and wonders anymore signs and wonders will be there and you will see it because it will be it might be be kind of only things that god only things that only you know about in your own personal life but god will manifest himself in in miraculous ways because it it can't help me manifest when the word is revealed to you do you know that one maybe one of the greatest signs of all is for a christian to live in this evil age for these virtues to be made manifest in their life for somebody a real god-called born-again child to manifest these virtues for these virtues to come out and for somebody to look at you and say there is real godliness there is somebody that could be schmidt in the face and yet would love his brother that's the kind of what what greater sign could there be than that but i'm not i'm not trying to make excuses or to polish it over you will see miracles in your life if you hold to the word the word of god will be right there in your home when people follow you when people get sick when you need god to come upon the scene because the greatest evidence that god is with you as you have the right doctrine that you have the right teaching down on the inside that you know your god i i really want to hit that you know i think just growing up in the message it seems like so many people get the thought in their head that the message is something that they can never quite understand it's so mysterious and things but you can't know what this message is about god will reveal it to you if you only take the time to open yourself up to yield yourself to him so that he can speak to you with that still small voice and what you believe will produce you see it matters what you believe it matters what you believe many times we come to church and we think you know well well i like this brother's preaching over here what what difference does it make if he's maybe preaching something a little bit off or whatever and we begin to think maybe that it doesn't matter so much but it matters what you believe because what you believe is the difference what you believe is the difference between the true and the false the true and the false will both have signs and wonders the true and the false will both have the miraculous worketh in their life but the true will know their god and will be known of him because he said as they came to the white throne judgment that scripture will read and depart from me i never knew you if he knows you and you know him that's the main thing so it says beware of false prophets in matthew chapter 7 verse 15 to 16 but where false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly inwardly down in their soul on the outside they're white-washed jesus said white-washed sepulchrals on the outside it looks clean but on the inside they've got false teaching if you don't care if you'd heal somebody on sunday as they said to jesus i uh on the sabbath i mean to say if you yield somebody on the sabbath then something's wrong with you you see their doctrine was misplaced and in verse 16 it says you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles and brother brown said what is the fruit the word the fruit for the season that's what it is they're teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the season what time is it it is man's doctrine denominational doctrine or god's word for the season so that's an important point too it's got to be god's word for the season we're not now teaching the doctrine of martin luther we're not teaching the doctrine of john wesley we're not teaching the doctrine of azusa street pentecost we're teaching the doctrine of the revealed word for this day the revelation of the son of man the opening of the seven seals the seven thunder mysteries and all that may seem very very mysterious to you but again god can reveal it to you god is able to reveal it to you so so how how do we identify false prophets false prophets will arise false christs will arise and be on the scenes so you identify by the teaching now now i want to kind of just hit a little bit sometimes we'll think that that a new a new christian come in a new little brother coming in or whatever they don't understand things and we'll be like that's false no that's not what we're talking about now we're talking about the word laid in front of you and you turn aside from it not not a young little new minister coming up and and just trying to begin preaching you know sometimes you begin to think that ministers ministers will never say anything wrong if that were true you remember the brother brown's first sermon the very first sermon he preached his pastor pulled him over to the side and said now you got everybody crying and everything but where's the word that you laid out everybody was crying and everything so brother brown's very first sermon he needed a little correction see we're all growing up to holding down time and just because you're awful a little bit see the the main thing is not that you're off but that you can be corrected do you know that's really one of the attributes of a real fivefold minister is maybe maybe they might be a little bit off but you go over and talk to them a little bit and say have you considered this scripture look at the scripture and they'll get right back in line because they want to be corrected real christian real son of god wants to be corrected so as brother brown begin to bring out these examples i i hope i'm not boring now it's it's only it's only the morning we haven't even got the turkey sandwiches and things hang on there with me brother brown began to run through these historical examples in the bible of of of comparison and one example one of the first examples he gave was was moses and balaam now now the difference was moses had he was he was bringing a message straight from scripture he had met god on the backside of the desert and he told him i am that i am and he moses asked him who are you and he began to impart to him a personal revelation of who he was and so moses was bringing them out based on that prophecy that that god gave to abraham back in genesis 15 where he said and he said unto abram noah assured you that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance so moses was going about his doings by the word he had a a word prophet that he was relying on he was basing everything all of his actions on the word but balaam the other example that brother brown gave balaam fundamentally was right he had the he had his he said his prophecy was all right when he prophesied about israel his fundamentals his seven altars his seven clean sacrifices his oxes and his seven rams and all of his doings just like just like uh just like king that that looked like he was very religious he wanted to serve god he had an appetite for god he was he wanted to be there in church but yet when balaam's case in cain's case the teaching was wrong you see it again it matters what you believe what you believe is what sets apart the difference it's what makes the difference and balaam's teaching was now see moses teaching was we are set apart people we've been separated we're going into the promised land but balaam's teaching was it doesn't matter what you believe we're all the same do you see that deception it doesn't matter what we believe we're all the same brother said now the teaching of balaam the teaching was wrong not the prophecy the prophecy was right and even he i think it was balaam that prophesied a root shall spring out of david and all those kind of things he prophesied correctly things that we still quote in the scripture but his teaching was wrong now the teaching of balaam not the prophecy of balaam that was all right that was god how many believes that the prophecy of balaam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of god wouldn't speak nothing else and god vindicated it by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of balaam now as brother branham was bringing out these things he said he wanted to point out that the reason he's bringing this out is so you can know what you are by examining yourself he said what just whatever you believe just sit still and listen and ask god to open your heart then you'll find out whether you're a bride a briar or a thistle or wherever you're standing and maybe maybe if i could just speak on that for a little bit examine yourself and see if you have a revelation that matches the prophet's message if you've been coming to church all of these years and you really don't me what know what the message is about maybe it's time to get serious and get concerned even though and you know just kind of growing up in the message you hear so many people point back to some kind of supernatural experience or a life i was sitting on the front porch somebody might say and i saw the pillar of fire there and therefore i know that i'm right i was sitting in my yard maybe one day praying and i felt the holy spirit come down and therefore i know that i'm right now listen on me listen to me don't don't fall asleep on me because this is this is important i don't believe that brother branham would preach this just for it to fall void and fall fall to deaf ears but you see this this is what sets you apart is your doctrine it's important to know what you believe and if you come to church and you don't know what you believe then it's time to be concerned that's what i believe that that by the confession of your mouth is how you're saved because if you can't speak it if you can't tell somebody what you believe do you really believe anything that's right do you really do you really believe what do you if somebody were to say well what do you believe about the serpent seed i don't know if somebody were to and you were to say i don't know do you what do you really believe anything about it if somebody were to say well what's the mystery of the first seal now let's get let's hone it down a little bit yeah if somebody were to ask you what do you believe the bible says to uh be ready to give a reason for the hope that lies within you be ready to explain what you believe because if you can't explain it if you can't even say even the most basic fundamental thing then do you really believe it if you can't confess it yeah bill brahman said oh you false teachers listening to these tapes all these years and seeing god confirm exactly what he said and you said in your study and know us the truth and because of your denominational differences you dispute them and tell your people they're not so so you see faith is not something that because we sit in a particular church we believe this particular way brother brown said it's not a dogmatic system it's not something that we believe just because somebody told us but it's something that god has personally revealed to you you have to have a revelation for yourself it's not just it's not enough to come to church and say well i know that my pastor has a revelation or i know that these ministers have a revelation but you yourself need to be able to speak it right i i was called to mind i just began thinking of you know that story in the bible where they came they were crossing over to the i don't remember all the details of this story but they got to the river and there was one tribe that was preventing the other tribe from crossing unless they could say the word shibboleth in just the right way and because they they because of their speaking they would drop a little syllable off of that they couldn't form their word just right they couldn't pass over you see because of their confession they could not pass over their confession was wrong you need to be able to speak it correctly you're going over based on your confess your confession of what what your revelation is and what you believe it to be right and if your confession is i don't know then it's time to be concerned another another example that brother brown gave and the clock's ticking on around so y'all just hold on with me in first kings chapter 22 was micah and zedekiah and in this story this is the story of ahab and jehoshaphat and ahab gets in his idea that that these this territory over here this blessing of israel say god has promised us this blessing and i'm the man that's going to go take it back despite the word of god telling him otherwise now micah micah the prophet was called upon the scene and and his on the other side they called zedekiah who rose up to to come against micah and micah the true word prophet was basing his prophecy on what elijah had already prophesied elijah had said in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine so elijah had already prophesied that that that ahab was going to die and the logs would lick his blood and zedekiah comes on the scene and says prophesies false doctrine prophesies now the spirit was on him but he prophesied he taught false doctrine and he said no everything's going to be all right we're going to be victorious and you see brother branham points out that zedekiah's motive seemed good his motive was to take back the blessing of israel to go and take back the inheritance that land was israel's inheritance it belonged to them it seemed right but yet it was fundamentally wrong down in the doctrine and if you go back and read just kind of study on first kings chapter 22 do you i hope everybody goes and studies on things you must study in your own private time you know you almost want to force people sometimes to just grab the back of their head and push it into the bible but you can't do that it's got to be something personal that you do and if something's really on the inside pulling you to the word you will do it and you'll spend time and look look into these scriptures so in first kings chapter 22 you've got this scene up in heaven and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at raymond gilead and one said on this manner and another set on this manner and then a lion spirit came forth and said and in verse 23 it says now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee so the spirit he's he was speaking he was prophesying zedekiah was prophesying a lie and look how brother brown word said he said i saw god this is zedekiah speaking i saw god he told me to make these horns out of iron go out there and push the nations out of there for this belongs to us the others ain't got no right and brother branham said that zedekiah was an honorable man trying to give back to the church the material things that belonged to the church of course he had his eye on the material instead of the spiritual he said we own property we're a great organization join us it's all brothers and sisters and let's let's examine the things that brother branham had to say about zedekiah he said that zedekiah was the greatest man in the nation in the military and natural site he was the head prophet by the king he was the head of all the other prophets by organization he was made by his organization the head of all of them he was probably the best read he was the best educated he was more eligible for the job and he was anointed with the holy spirit for he's called a prophet and not just an ordinary prophet but a hebrew prophet do you see how the deception will be in this latter time and brother branham said the latter time is where the deception comes somebody that looks like they've got all the credentials they're part of the message they're in the movement they're they're the head that looks like they're maybe the best read they should be the one that knows what they're talking about and the question for you this morning is will you be deceived because the only way that you cannot be deceived is if you have the word the revelation the word is what makes the difference brother ram said what if what if it had been said can you find any fault in zedekiah micah no did you ever catch him in sin nope now see this is not a like a sinner that kind somebody going around to bars and honky talks and stuff this is somebody that's keeping themselves clean did you ever hear him cuss anybody no did you ever catch him drunk nope can you dispute his education nope do you believe his doctor's degree is false nope you believe his phd is all right sure by the sanhedrin council i guess it's all counsel i guess it's all right well then why don't you join with him because he's off the word you see what makes a difference is not sensations or feelings or looking back at something supernatural the difference is the word now now see brother brown said if you're a child of god you'll stay with the prophet of this bible it's the word now now see that's another thing that's confusing a little bit maybe to stay with the prophet does not mean to say i believe that god sent a prophet to stay with the prophet means to understand what the teaching of the prophet is and then you'll be able to stay with it it's not good enough just to say i don't know what the prophet taught but yet i believe that there's going to come somebody in this end time and to barely have an understanding you must have an understanding of the message because that's what makes the difference and i'ma just keep hitting that despite maybe how boring that may seem because that is what that is what will save us i believe we were listening to that message convinced to concerned on the way over here this morning and brother brown was talking about when you become convinced about the truth you become concerned for others and when i listen to this message the anointing ones at the end time it makes me concerned that's maybe why i want to lay it out so plain this morning that to turn to turn your back on and to walk away from it you just have to you just have to about fall over it yes that's right another example that brother brown gave was jeremiah and hananiah and jeremiah prophesied that that israel was going to go down into babylon for 70 years and had an eye said no it's just going to be two the lord showed me the lord himself came down and told me and jeremiah said he said go and see remember hannah and i took that that yoke that jeremiah had on the back to show that jeremiah put that yoke on his back to say go go down and be in bondage be in yoke to the king of babylon for 70 years and hannah and i took it off his back said i know better than you and and broke it in pieces i know better than you the lord the lord spoke to me and he told me something different and jeremiah said go and tell hananiah this is what the lord says you have broken a wooden yoke but in its place you will get a yoke of iron this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they will serve him but on the other hand hanoni's doctrine was you're all right as long as you belong in other words it don't matter what you believe as long as you belong as long as you're israel as long as you're a good message believer you just come sit in a message church and you can put over your door message believer and hang it put a little little eagle over your door or whatever as long as you're israel that's all that's necessary i'm taking this right out of this message these are not my words he said hey brother brandon said hannah and i said don't be alarmed don't be scared but maybe maybe it's time for us to be alarmed a little bit and scared about our current predicament maybe it's checking up time to see if we really have a true revelation for this hour and and the bible says that hannah and i because he rejected the word eternity he walked in iniquity he was a worker of iniquity because he turned away from the truth it said he was dead that year you see what's so perplexing what's so confusing to so many is that the holy spirit can work in the life of a hypocrite down on the inside he will not be true but the holy spirit still doing wonders and miracles in your life and doing things supernatural like like that story that brother brown told about how he went to that first pentecostal meeting and and he by discernment was able to tell that that one man that was speaking in tongues was living with another man's wife are living with adultery and yet the other man was true you see both of them the spirit working but yet down on the inside of one of them his doctrine was incorrect because he was walking in iniquity he knew it was not right to live with another man's wife he knew it was not right to live in adultery but yeah he was walking in that way despite the truth being laid in front of him and matthew chapter 15 says ye hypocrisy well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men teaching for doctrines their own ideas instead of what the word says because the word is what makes the difference and even jesus said in luke chapter 11 he said if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be judges in other words the pharisees were casting out devils now we were watching one of those one of those new little movies that they came about about jesus and this is one thing that i disagree with because it was the chosen film and in that movie they got nicodemus coming up and he he to the to a st magdalene or somebody and he could not cast out an evil spirit and see this is contrary to what the bible says because the bible says that the pharisees were casting out spirits their sons were casting out spirits but the difference was not that one could cast out spirits and the other could not as this movie portrayed the difference is the doctrine the difference is the teaching and there's there's the deception brother branham said in hebrews chapter 2 he says every christian spirit exalts jesus not only by your lips but by your life your lips can say one thing your life do another if you do that you know what it is that's hypocrisy and i'd rather face heaven as an infidel than a hypocrite i take my chance better i believe in heaven as an infidel than to be a hypocrite if you testify for jesus and say he's the savior you live like that because people is going to expect it out of you that's right you live like a christian ought to in other words i believe what he's saying and i'm not trying to interpret her nothing but make sure that the inside is right because you can say with your outside that i'm a christian i'm a message believer and all those kind of things but do the checking up to make sure that down on the inside it's not just a separate field with dead men's bones that you're not just a white washed grave with the tombstone whitewashed on the outside to make it look clean and nice on the outside but down on the inside you've got false doctrine jesus said talking about uh well let's read second timothy verse chapter 3 where it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come and i'm really just following the path that brother ranum took as he preached the anointed ones in the end time so if you were maybe not quite grasping what i'm talking about this morning don't go listen to me over again go listen to brother branham over again and pause it and rewind and just kind of meditate on the things that he says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come in the last days that's this day and he said brother branham explained it he gave a little explanation perilous and deceptive times deceptive times why but for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and unthankful and holy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hitting high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god in other words he's saying no natural love just selfish and self-centered out for their own personal gain but here's the real kicker you think he's talking about people out in the world but in verse 5 he says having a form of godliness this is church people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away what is the power that will be denied the power is the word because the word is what will change you the word here received in the heart of a believer will call will convict you and cause you to realize that you're lost that you're not where you should be that will change you that will take you they will add these virtues the word is the power of god unto salvation amen performing miracles signs and wonders but denying the word that can change your life and then brother branham began to use this example of janice and jambers when moses went down into egypt he threw down the serpent and janice and jammers could too he did all these things that they could do ever ever ever plague he called they could do it too they could do the same thing he said any miracle that moses could do they could do keep that in mind we're coming to it after a while they can do anything the rest of them to do but they can't stay with the word they can't stay with the word in exodus chapter 7 it says then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments when when when moses came down and he put his serpent down they were able to do that too when he turned the water in the blood they were able to do that too when he caused frogs to come up they were able to do that too but where they were wrong was in their doctrine and and listen listen the way how brother branham explains this he said pharaoh's denomination says we have a man that can do that same thing and they did it he said pharaoh's heart was hardened to prove that moses wasn't the only one that had the word he wanted to prove that moses wasn't the only one that was right and the way that he wanted to prove it was by signs and wonders but you see that's where the deception is the truth lies in in the revelation and he said in second timothy chapter three verses eight to nine now as janice and jammers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith and brother abraham said reprobate means apostasy and apostasy means an act of refusing to continue to follow obey or recognize a religious faith or abandonment of a previous loyalty abandonment in other words you say i don't believe that anymore and the message one that's brother abraham said let me make that again do not disbelieve any word of god's bible just don't say yes i believe it say but no there's nothing about that you believe it you'll accept it if you lay it aside say well my church don't believe it that way then you do not believe it's god's word and you'll walk away under the same condemnation that eve went away under you separated yourself from the eternal when you had a chance to be united with him now remember that cannot be questioned because it was one word that in god's word and then then brother branham begins to go into will i find faith will i find faith when i return jesus said and brother brown said here is the question if you follow in that line in this hour hour will it be finished will i find the faith will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original the word will i find that original faith in the end will i find somebody that's willing to accept it and believe it until it come becomes reality to them will i find faith that's why it's so important to stay with the word if you if you take one word off then it takes you down into death right that's why brother brown hits so often where is the where is the trinity in the bible it doesn't there's nowhere in the bible where it says trinity where does it say to baptizing titles where does it say that the initial evidence is speaking in tongues and let me bring it on down to a little bit hone in holding time a little bit more where does it say that being born again is just recognizing that you always had it and you just come to a realization that you always had eternal life it does not say that anywhere where does it say when you're born again that you've got everything then you don't need to grow where does it take away the growth where does it say predestination is how that god pushes you through a tube and you don't have to read your bible and you don't have to come to church that god just pushes you and he's the one doing everything like that where does it say jesus was not god when he was born where does it say that it says that he was elohim in the manger where does it say we don't need a personal revelation it doesn't say those things but listen when you begin to understand how you are positioned that the word of god is being made real in your own life see this is this is what will give us confidence this is what will give us confidence to realize for the church for the bride to realize who she is and what she's here for to realize that your iniquity has been taken away because why what will take away your iniquity the true correct doctrine the true correct doctrine of how to be baptized the name of god the godhead where god is right now where he is tabernacled all of these things the serpent seed all these things that have built up until they are building you up into the stature of a perfect man and that kind of a man will know that there is no iniquity in them because they've been honed down honed down by the word until the word is made fully manifest in that person's life i think that's why the god put a five-fold ministry do you know brother brown in this sermon said that he put the five-fold ministry in the church to keep it clean to keep it clean to make sure that people don't go off into darkness and default things and get carried away with different things don't get carried away don't be see don't look at the wrong thing as the evidence of your salvation don't look at the fact that once upon a time you had something supernatural happen just for a brief moment and that is the evidence the evidence is that your your revelation matches up with the word and that your life the works matches up with the word and that is the evidence that god has brought a change in your life i'm trying to skip over some of these because i don't want to hold you too long this morning of course we got lunch too so i can't hold you too long you've got an escape brother brown said in matthew or jesus said in matthew chapter 7 you shall know them by their fruits and so going back to matthew chapter 7 verse 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from ye that work iniquity so you see now what iniquity is iniquity and the message influenced brother said iniquity what is iniquity iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding to it when you know your creeds are wrong and you still hold to it that's iniquity well the holy ghost fell on me he said i i don't doubt that a bit i spoke in tongues i sang in the spirit i done i don't doubt that a bit no question to that oh brother sister what kind of a condition this is a trembling time where we at this word is coming to life now and see then he goes and he begins to use some more examples and he talks about how saint martin had that there was a young monk that rose up he actually told several stories about saint martin as he was illustrated and one of these stories that he said there was a young monk that said the lord he rose up and said the lord has made me a prophet and i'm going to prove it to you he rose up there in the monastery and he said tonight the lord is going to give me a big fine robe and put it on me a white robe and set among you then all of you shall come up to me see and you'll take orders from me he said that a light was going to come on and it would reveal him sitting there in the in the white robe and and and that actually happened that actually came to pass but brother brown said as he was relating the story he said when he went and got the old dean of the college he walked up and down a little bit and said son that don't sound right he said you ever been listening to a sermon it's just like that don't sound right i don't think that's what brother brown said there's only one way here it is there's only one way for us to know it looks supernatural boy pentecost would have grabbed that root sinker line hook and everything else he said the miracle may seem all right but it don't seem right to the word and he said now we have such a person an anointed prophet by the name of martin come go up before him see my to think that the word was so manifest in martin saint martin that when this man went up with his robe and the light shining all of him it said brother ram said they grabbed him by the arm to take him before martin and the robe left him because that deception couldn't stand before the word deception can't stand before the word we've got to have a true understanding of how god will manifest himself in the bride in this last day where he will be placed and see then brother branham kind of shifts and he begins to talk about that he begins to talk about a new trinity that would come forth in revelation chapter 16. you all okay y'all hanging with me i'll be done in just a few minutes all right thank you brother luis i appreciate that encouragement and i saw three revelation chapter 16 says and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth see the spirits of devils working miracles this whole sermon he's talking about how that just because something works a miracle does not mean it's the truth and here comes these spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole earth a whole world to gather them to gather them that's what we were talking about the god of this evil age when we were talking about that how that the devil is gathering his people to him god is gathering his people to him to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty and brotherhood said now see the tren the trinity of frogs came out of an old trinity give birth to a new trinity their mother what had come out of a trinity the dragon see the beast and the false prophet a trinity knew for when were these frogs come out when did it notice there was all the time but it wasn't manifested until between the sixth and the seventh vial just before the seals open to reveal it now see the trinity the original false doctrine of the trinity was a false conception of the godhead a false conception of who that man was on the shores of galilee a false conception of how all that played in how god would tabernacle himself in a man how he would appear who how god will be manifesting himself what the nature of the godhead was is it three different people or is it god just changing his form and this new trinity i believe will be will be a perversion again of how god is manifesting himself a deception to get your eye off the real thing of where god is revealing himself brother brahman said for in the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of god will be known all these trinitarian things and false baptisms and everything was to be made manifest god help us to see what's truth and not think it's somebody trying to say something to you and then he says i feel that spirit resenting that i feel that spirit resenting that i'm not speaking of myself brother he's not he's not trying to get people to look at him i'm speaking of the angel of the lord that's in the camp that's right in other words he's speaking he's trying to get people to see the correct revelation of where god is going to tabernacle himself and if you begin to look at brother branham that brother branham is the son of man you're looking at the wrong thing brother branham is now off the scene but the son of man will be christ again revealed in human flesh the deception will get you off of that unable to see exactly the truth the only way that you'll see the truth is by the word you see if you don't understand these these truths of the the son of man and the statue of a perfect man and christ the mystery of god revealed and who is this melchizedek and the unveiling of god how god will be unveiled this day then you will be caught up in the deception because you can't see the truth of how god will reveal himself it's misidentifying the present day truth that's it brother ram said in this message he said in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now there's the deception unable to separate and look at it correctly that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shook you see you see even in first john now hang on wait with me just for a minute in first john chapter four let's go to that real quick and then we'll close the deception the antichrist spirit will deceive you from realizing where god is that's right he said in 1st john chapter 4 verse 2 hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god is come in the flesh now that first trinity was to deceive to deceive you from who knowing who that was that came in the flesh what would this deception be in this last day to get you off from understanding where god is where he is tabernacled here every spirit that confesses that jesus christ not was come in the flesh but is coming the flesh he is come in the flesh not just because the minister's preaching it to you and therefore that makes it to you you have to have a revelation of it for your own self and the revelation comes by feasting on the word by eating the word until it is built up within you and then you will know whether or not jesus has come in the flesh is coming the flesh present tense is come in the flesh and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist now not come not come in brother branham's flesh so much we believe that god spoke through him he said i've yielded my vessel to him he uses my lips but now that tabernacle that vessel is gone so where is he tabernacled brother brown said a false trinity was rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days it went right on through with it but when the seven seals become and open those mysteries and reveal them that's when the frog see after the seven seals are open then those frogs come out that's when the frogs three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a trinity doctrine against the truth see where it come from see where it's going back to they're all brothers anyhow same spirit same things and watch so deceiving performing miracles and these are devils that go forth to all the gods of the earth working miracles to deceive them in the last day and will succeed in doing it what did god say about that evil spirit said i'll go down and get in the mouth of those prophets and cause them to prophesy a lie to cause ahab to come out there to be destroyed and god said go you will succeed you will get them to believe it they're not on that word to begin with if you're not on that word you will be deceived and what is the deception the the real word is over there you got to go over the geographical good go to that location and then you can get it the bible says if if they say go over here over there don't believe it because why the word is neither ye in thy mouth if the word is in you you don't have to go to any particular geographic location to get it it's right there with you because god is revealing himself to you personally and he said again you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself it's not about himself he's trying to get you to see the revelation of the message to you personally being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declare to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through and you see the treacherous how treacherous this is to preach that we when you begin to get your eye off of the man and look at the message that he was preaching and allow that message to come become part of you and receive that message that you're not looking at that man as the son of man you're not looking at that man as the fulfillment of of the scripture that you are supposed to fulfill but you're looking at that the one that has come that is on the scene that's why he kept majoring on preaching hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that same one that was he with him is now still on the scene with the church that same one that he was preaching about that he said i have no more to do with it with nothing that same one is still here in the church today and he's identified not so much by sensations or by signs and wonders but by a true doctrine a true revelation of who he is and who he is in the church today and where he is how he is being tabernacled and you and i christ in us the hope of glory the musicians can go ahead and come on we are doing that brother brown said three things to say before we close as the musicians come he said the world is in a solemn condition that's the unbeliever it's in that hour that janus and jambers appear the make-believer the deceivers it's in that same hour that the son of man is to be revealed the true believer there do you see how he categorized the son of man with the true believer he said that that's his words not mine the son of man categorized with the true believer and in this hour these three groups of people are being pulled into their own separate groups this this is such a great time to live in the same hour where the elect cannot be deceived because they are the word you believe it let's let's stand to our feet let's rejoice [Music] as he passes by [Music] whatever need you have need of you can receive it right there in your seat
