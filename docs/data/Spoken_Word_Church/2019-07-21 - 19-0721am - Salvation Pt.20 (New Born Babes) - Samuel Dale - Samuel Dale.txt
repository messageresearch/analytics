[Music] and when awake in the morning my headdress I am Blair [Music] morning Saints beautiful day it is to be here today and joyful thing to know that we can come and gather around God's Word and

and amen good to see everybody the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turned back where we've been reading from Ephesians 2 then we'll go to Ephesians 1 and then go to Romans 8 try to get into our thought for today then just remember to pray for that's you're never one waiting June I think I'll be coming back in tomorrow remember them ever all the others traveling the different ones and that the Lord would bless brother Louisa's out traveling he's going and caring brother Oh Royale Soriano and carried him to different places to where he can preach and things and so this approach the Lord would take care of them and give them a safe journey remember that on - I guess you've noticed we've got on kind of a little hole over here on the side of us - where the building there's no longer there so just be careful out there especially to the kids don't get over in there and don't get around those trash bins down there until we can get them all out of the way but it looks real good out there we've got Terrance and and zach and and his budding all got down there and got it all dug out and took care of it boy done a lot of it so we appreciate it it looks good we've just thank the Lord for the people giving us that building and things and then we could be able to you know get it all tore out and and make it more usable for us okay remember to pray for brother I'll and sister Anna or the Alice real sick this morning and I know sister Anna is to remember them keep them in your prayers remember brother Addison - the Lord would be with him and take care of him and sister Durrett she had to have a gallbladder surgery yesterday you know but they said she was at home and all and just prayed the Lord would would be with her and all the others all the other sicknesses we have many things among us you know just remember pray one for another buddy else always seemed to forget one but anyhow remember that okay visions - then we're going back into Romans right father we thank you for this day in your grace and love Lord thank you for everything we just asked you to come among us in a mighty way today and let your understanding be with us let your heart Lord come to our hearts to where that we can father receive and understand and open our eyes to that word forgive our sins because we know where we fail you and we just pray that you'd bless each one got it all and remember all of these that are away from us that are seeking all remember each one's our brother Daugherty still having trouble with his eyes and onand we just appreciate you touching some Lord and bringing them on out and just bring the rest Lord and that everything be in your love we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name Amen visions 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God it's a journey right ok drop back a few verses to verse 3 in the first chapter it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so keep these scriptures now we'll go to Roman's that'll be picking up a main part of our thought I guess from Romans 8 as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear which you've received the spirit of adoption what about you cry father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are their children of God any children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word but have a sister there brother sister Rachel's sister-in-law I can never remember nine so don't worry about that she knows who she is but glad I've heard children with us today then now we've been trying for a while to get into our thought of the new birth and I want you to see from the word cause see that away then if I can follow it through the word you can follow it through the word then you can read it for yourself and understand and get into the right channel of everything see we were all born in sin shapen in iniquity come came into the world lost it doesn't matter who we are everybody was born done away except Adam Adam was created he was created everything since then has come by the fact of you know being brought into the world by natural birth that brought us as human beings and and put us in to the to a world of sin all right and put us into Satan's domain that we were not to have been we were to vent into the domain of God and it would have been wonderful that had it stayed like the Garden of Eden and everything you know whatever he wanted to do to bring us into being that's up to him but to the basis of you know us our sale and knowing that we come lawston and where we're searching for the redemption and he made away he came himself to give us you know his own life and that that would make us come out to be then the children of God because that was his original plan was to have children you know that was original plan that was that was what he wanted but he didn't want it with the sin involved uh-huh but then he still had attributes within him that was needing to be displayed so in the display of that he permitted different things and to bring it into being that we would all wind up being lost and needing a savior okay but we by that we could receive then eternal life and come back to the original plan and purpose of God but it would take all of the time coming down that it took four thousand years for Jesus Christ to come into being to where he could give his life you know so God's not even no big Harry we're the ones has the problems with that and are the disciples for three and a half years were tutored and trained of the Lord Jesus before the Holy Ghost fell upon them on the day of Pentecost making them then the offspring of God so we were thank God that we understand the plan of redemption and bringing it into view and to see what it is and to thank God for the truth of knowing what it is instead of just going along with what ideas of man you know people say well what is the nubert well it was accepted Jesus Christ that's part of the plan alright that's part of the plan but that's not all of it all right see there's more to it that has he accepted us okay and see well then you look at the religious world so you you may think that I'm so well dogmatic of stand upon things but do you realize and it just dawned on you to think a little bit about it of me trying to stir you up that the whole religious the basics of all the religious world is on the basis of just ideas and thoughts of salvation where are they that teach the new birth the new birth to them is just believing on Jesus Christ what I accepted him as my savior enough so I'm saved you know well that's not all the story all right that that's not the whole story we need to understand more about redemption than to just think about it as well well I just believe well the devil believes so is he saved no it's an onus of well that's all right then you know I'm not D Christianizing the world I'm just telling it like it is the word is what does the D Christianizing alright according to the word you must be born again that was Jesus's first message right all right so then being his first message that ties together the entire being of what he is I said come 4,000 years to get into being and and coming to that place of her that things could happen to bring you in I a new birth because if we're not born again see we're still lost you say well then what else can we do I'm not saying that's the hope you get the point I'm not saying the world is lost or the religious rent that's between them and God that ain't none of your bidness to mine neither one you know it's not for us to try to convert the world we do the best we can with what we can and the things that we are to try to minister the word to help people right but still if you let's think about what I'm saying if you went were over here to see what the new birth is and they tell you well it's this and you over here and they say well that's this go over here and they say well that's the N over here in a sense there well then which one is right do we need to get with the one that's right it doesn't matter which way it goes or how to find the truth of it okay see now god didn't have to send us a prophet to bring the new birth back into being right we were hitting that a little Wednesday on God didn't have to send a prophet to bring us the understanding of the new birth it was in the Bible well yet we had twisted it so much to straighten out that yes sure to straighten out the new birth yes we needed the Prophet in his message but do you understand what I'm saying they were already preaching the new birth before the Prophet ever came into being and people were already being warned again because God was winking at the ignorance as the scripture would say and you know not counting things and bypassing all of it waiting till the time that he could bring the word but see then now we say well what is the new birth well I shouted I cried I spoke in tongue that's exactly what the organized religion has always taught those forms of some thing that happens as being the new birth but is that the new birth or is that like a baby you got to go to the to the baby to see the new birth right the natural birth is the top of the spiritual birth so what's the natural burden water blood life drop off one of them it doesn't work all right see then the baby comes into being and you know you spank it and it screams out in receiving life all right and as it does that then it cries it Wiggles it moves it does all kind of things what because those are the attributes of the fact see that's not the birth the birth is took place the birthing is not the the baby as it cries out the the birth is the the life that comes in that causes the baby in the natural to cry all right see then in the spiritual birth I'm saying this for a purpose in the spiritual birth we know that it's justification sanctification the baptism with the Holy Ghost then we shout and cry the birth you got to get the baby here then you can talk about gifts and operations and things like that but that birth is the birth of life coming into the child and the natural which is the life of Christ coming into the spiritual creating a new birth all right see then we come into the message and we begin to get deeper into understanding of the things and here comes a prophet to explain it and telling us that new birth will we ought to listen to what he has to say you know listen to what he says about it because if we're going to believe in to be a prophet all right What did he say he said the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well do you understand what he's saying Richard now we're talking about this yesterday going with on land and back do you understand what it means to say that the new birth is the birth of the word you know is the natural birth a seed planted comes forth produces a child what is the spiritual birth the word made alive into your heart all right now if that's true then do you understand what I'm saying or what I said for over and over about it that the profits that Christ the mystery of God revealed that didn't what is the new birth murder run and he said just a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well brother Dale I don't remember getting a revelation see I've tried my best to explain that to where you wouldn't go into those realms of thinking you know well did I get when I got born again did I get to Revelation to one God then I get to Revelation the water baptism did I get a revelation one see that that can't be it's our understanding of something instead of those points like that so what if I tried to express to you what is that new birth the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now the 3,000 that were saved on the day of Pentecost outside they heard a message right Peter preached a message and the Holy Ghost failed at the house of kunia Peter then brought a message and all the ghosts fail now some of like canoeist everyone they already knew some things but does to me is the to see the birth and what is the birth on the dead Pentecost some of those people maybe that that was the first time they had heard anything about the Lord Jesus Christ let me get this off of my heart or that you can understand what is that birth of the word it's the word made alive well what happened with that 3000 what happened at the house Oakland he is what happens to all of us you've got to hear the word before you can be born again true you're not born again just by setting somewhere and something happened the light comes down and all the time no faith cometh by hearing all right the faith comes by hearing you know all right now if it comes by hearing then the seeds got to be planted into the individual before it could be made alive and that's what I've tried to emphasize what the Prophet is saying when he says that it's a revelation of Jesus crying now like I said you realize on the Deaf pinnacles those people maybe a lot of them had never heard do you realise what it takes to bring a new birth suppose you today would leave and go to any place in the country that had never heard about Jesus Christ or anything like that or Christians or how do you think you could get them people saved well God just drop I know this concept don't know it doesn't work how is it that people come to salvation what brought you to salvation I see you heard the word somebody mama daddy whoever it don't have to be a preacher then you can hear the word from anywhere you pick up a Bible and read it we still remember whatever you do even if you're reading the Bible that was written by one some man and that's God speaking to you from that word according to the Bible that we went over and over it says there in lakhs that they were when that when Peter spoke a great dynamic message of explaining the Lord Jesus Christ right that's where I ask you to go back and read these things but do you did you go back to acts one and read and see in acts two Peter preaches a sermon to them about this Messiah about this Christ and they become pricked in their heart right and they said men and brethren what must we do to be saved Peter said repent everyone be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise alright so what did they do what happened what would happen if you went to an island a place to her that no one had ever heard anything about Christianity how would you think about getting those people saved okay are you listening all right now I'm trying to make an illustration uh-huh I'm trying to say what if you went and done that what would you do well I get them telling me need to be saved they don't know what saved it well I just preach to them what would you preach to them I preach them they need to be saved they know nothing about it but it wouldn't be no great revelation of when I come over here to bring you the seals that's not what it is so you would have to first get those people to realize that they were lost and bring them the message of the Lord Jesus Christ coming in to earth to die for us right and what you got them to listen for a minute about that this plan of salvation this this religion you've got it's based on the death of Jesus Christ and how that Jesus Christ has come and died he done he say that's exactly what Peter darling he preached them a sermon about the Lord Jesus Christ and then God convicted him you see why it's so important what you preach it's so important about the truth sure God has to wink at her ignorance all the time but what about the you going out and trying to get somebody saved and telling them that's three God's you need to do this you need to do that now that's religion that ain't salvation Peter got up before a group of people that had never heard and he preached them a sermon about the coming of the seiyya that he had experienced in his 3.5 years of seeing who this man is and he told him about the Lord Jesus Christ then God could come down and burden their heart they become pricked in their heart and they say what can we do said alright now here's what you do you go get baptized and you follow the Lord and receive the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost fell on them that had been heard that one message if you understand what I've always tried to drive I believe it I don't believe you could be born again just by setting out in the woods and thinking about something will you know and you never heard about the Lord Jesus you understand what I'm saying you never heard about the Lord or anything but what is so amazing to me is that even the human being the way the human being is made he's made to worship and by doing that he'll worship the Sun the animals the moon the stars and the things right he'll worship them things because he was made to worship something we see we were made to worship the Lord Jesus Christ our God Himself are you listening to what is a new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not two seals you know it's not these things it's not a message of those type of things so that's what people think it is they think well boy I'll take this message and that's what they're making mass confusion they're going of our preaching you know they're taking it to the lands and preaching about this or that even though some of their parts are true but they're not bringing a conviction upon the people because God has to bring that but you got to get them to realize they're lost and that God came to save them that's what I'm telling you the new birth is the new birth is when you have heard the word it's been brought to you by somebody are you ready to whatever you know that's still somebody you had to come that away the word you could receive it and God can use that that is brought then to quicken your heart you're listening to what I'm talking about what was the new birth to the 3,000 it doesn't mention like it does of the Upper Room experience but when the fire came down to different time and doesn't mention that in the 3000 it just says as many as believe we were added under the church that day all right and it brought those people a new birth what was quickened to them that Jesus was Almighty God and what he had come to do it was a simple message at Peter pre read it learn the book of Acts he was simply explaining what God had done to come down to live in mankind and bring it forth it was a great mystery of this of the seals of the play we need to know right we need to know these things but we need a new birth then we get our growth development into those things that's what I'm trying to lay a little platform for didn't those things coming into being run around I'll never come out on Ohio River and said I won't you know what the first sale is and then that first event in second sales if there's it he preached for 30-something years and says it on the statue of a perfect man before he could bring that message of the stature of a perfect man that's why I've asked you to listen to it or to read it and take close attention to what he's doing it took him 30 years he said growth development goes on into the child coming on up it's in the the journey that we've been talking about right but you see what is now the birth of the word it's when the people heard the message of the Lord Jesus Christ now a lot of them didn't know who Jesus Christ was right but when the Peter explained that he was Almighty God and that he had walked among them then they begin to remember maybe that they'd heard of him they begin to think about what they had heard from somebody else or some of the Apostles had talked to them they begin to realize that Jesus Christ was Almighty God as Peter didn't get up pray I won't preach your Trinity now today they three of them you got to be laid it down that's what I've asked you to do just raid lingo town boy you got time for everything you know so go ahead but radar to see how simple then he laid down a message explaining who Jesus Christ was and he said this one that you've crucified right he told him said you crucified this one year he brought Jesus Christ out in the open to the people and then God could use that to condemn them in their heart and when they accepted the fact that he had died for them the oligos came right then they receive the new birth not a revelation of the seals the plagues of Allah it's not a revelation that way the revelation was the fact of what he had they had heard and the our sermon that they were listening to one of the days realize why your profit makes a statement he said you're sitting in your aisle he said you get up and start this way said you need salvation who need even he said what was solved when you still don't started this way right he was healed when you got up started this way you were saved when you got up started this way why because he's something that was taking place something had been made known to you in your mind or would call it brain mister you need to be healed you need to come up be prayed for these in the new birth is the birth of the word the word that they heard the hour or so sermon that they heard was made alive to them what always been alive that Jesus was Almighty God there's a new birth when it's revealed to you that he was God not just because you read it or studied it or climate or the Prophet said it it's when it's revealed to you that he's God they wouldn't made known to you that was Almighty God they then he came quicken it now that's what I've tried to explain I believe what's your property's telling because what else you gonna make it but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ what was made alive to the three thousand a revelation of Jesus Christ right see then the birth was the birth of the word they heard what they heard was made alive into their hearts and see that was the birth the holy ghost come down and quicken what they had heard darkest of Earth it's the birth of the word that's what I've always preached to you I'm always preaching down what comes is what I believe the birth is a verse of the word and the natural baby of the birth is a birth of the seed that was planted and a spiritual child it's the seed that was planted of the Word of God that you heard like I said what would you do if you were scheduled to go to some Island someplace and nobody there knew anything about salvation you go to how to first get them to a point that they realize that they're lost and you can't do it by trying to explain the goodnesses of things to it but if you can explain Jesus Christ God can come down and quicken that you know that's the foundational for what I'm trying to cite them cause you see Adam and Eve were created from their own dime it has to be a natural birth to bring in natural people right okay are you with me so I'm trying to preach a sermon about what Jesus Christ done God came into life himself to where he could die to release his life to where it could come and live in us and see then it's so vital how you preach it to people so you say come up to the altar and shake her hand or go quota queried or telling and you're saved now they ain't no such thing in the Bible there's no such thing in the Word of God if Jesus was explaining to Nicodemus in his first sermon that he preached that he must be born again and he told him how right old Nicodemus like us so you mean I always go back to my mother nothing he said no no no I'm trying to tell you that Jesus Christ this one has come and died in your place and you need to be saved it's the preaching about Jesus that people get saved from not preaching them creeds and ideas that only makes another church or another Creed you or another cult hmm I bread around and see it I don't believe we're getting people to Jesus Christ no see we're getting them to her own ideas and thoughts or something no see Wednesday night then our point was what we were talking about in the simplicity of it of the fact of how the Bible tells us what we are when you're born again all right Adam and Eve was the only ones that was created rest were born okay all right now so everybody come into the world lost everybody come in the world lost everybody is required to new birth if they're going to be in the kingdom of God all right so then if that be true then it would make ever by ever person would be the same birth would be the same and this time of I spent on that the new birth is the same to everybody and for you want to make it something this out of the other that's not the new birth brother Dale these people shouted these people cried these spoken to that ain't got to do with a new birth that's supposed to happen after the birth right that's not the birth that's the baby crying after he gets here see the new birth is the birth of the word well I'll see then you flop back well I never got a revelation I don't understand brother Dale he talks about a revelation you mean we got to get a graph relation to be born again a revelation of Jesus Christ yes and that Jesus Christ was Almighty God yes the once its truth is required God has quit winking at the fact of what we believed prior he went through those days and in hours and kinds of it not being clearly to understand and he winked at it but he doesn't wink at it anymore my will said he called command now all men to repent see I've tried to tell you whatever the new birth is it's got to be the same to ever person and the same in every age and it's been so hard to try to explain because see people Luther them they got there what's that got to do with the birth you know what I just don't understand how Luther could track a beer and set in the pub talk about I don't understand how me and you can do the way we do you want to talk the office doors open don't play with me on stuff like that I don't understand how you and me can be what we are and act the way we act oh we make drinking the beer before I don't understand God winked at ignorance and that's why he had to sin see he done it himself he said John Wesley with a message of sanctification I like the way brother smoke used to try to explain it he said kind of he said if you look at Luther little said you look at him said he's he's over here into the world of sin looks like and you can't hardly see you know but said if you don't look and see that there's a bungee cords hung from here to there that's pulling him and keeping him from going too far you know now that was his way of explain he said now when Wesley come along said he had to hook him and pull him over this away and said naturally when he pulled him over this away said Wesley pulled it a little too far that may not mean a thing to you but it means a lot to me Wesley was pulling that say you know condemning the people for what they were doing and it was right to condemn sin with ours in in his life maybe he was doing just what the other people was doing in another way but you see then the baptism when the Holy Ghost has to hook it and pull it right back into the middle Jerusha Street went off and cabbage down on their doctrines and ideas and when I for all kind of signs and wonders which you know there was some true people though there really to receive Jesus Christ they really had the new birth well brother so-and-so said is it well I don't care what brother so-and-so says brother Branham is when it said it said I met people with a Holy Ghost fifty years before just like the day of Pentecost but you see Church the birth is the same the after-effects is what we look at cried sprout had done this to my brother Dale you took away everything you took away all of my things that I thought all of my life was the sign or thought that I was born again right you base it on looks like some intellectual and that's where I'm against that down through you're wrong you're wrong to think that way it ain't intellectual a new birth ain't no intellect the simplicity of the revelation of Jesus Christ is not intellect it is a revelation that's why I believe it like that you say yeah but all of our life I've depended on the fact that I shouted and that the day I was born again well praise God that's wonderful you shouted with the shout and wouldn't the birth I'm not destroying the shouting I'm destroying the fact of thoughts of what we think about it we think the shouting was what it was no the birth is the birth then the shouting the baby is brought into the world then it cries and we don't allow it I know what that goes through you might want to say it we don't we don't want to accept that everybody is born again the same way now why not well I I just don't understand how that Martin Luther could a drank a beer and set in a pub talk about the gospel listen Church have gotten so far in men's and ideas and things back there until there was no condemnation from anything told from the pulpit that got to the bases too you could just fill out a piece of paper and get a thing a right to go out and kill a man before you ever killed him and here comes Luther out who is there to condemn him to show him these things are wrong well they show no your way over here well I'll tell you what I never did drink I didn't either that don't save me I've tried to explain that and people don't listen to you see you become a religious person and you think your religion is what it is you think because I didn't well then that's what I tried to tell the brothers in the message they kept talking about born with this seat in there I said well they sure must have been in me some way because I surely oh like the devil till I heard the truth and got born again was I saved all that time because I didn't drank didn't smoke didn't you didn't lie No I was in danger of the fact of him thinking I didn't do that but you understand the birth is the same what happens is the attributes of those things everybody has the same identical new birth or they don't have it you can't have a dozen different new birth you got one new birth and it's the birth of the word no matter what age is in its the birth of the word see that each age has a birth and then we were trying to bring that out to other day where bread run said that if people in this age would to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 right I believe in that I've taught you that I talked to you that this message has to come to a basis I'm looking for an outpouring from heaven of a great outpouring of the Holy Ghost to take us in the rapture right I've always talked that always believe it what you see that new birth they put it on the word then shout and cry what you're saying they're shouting and crime is a new bar that's the country to the Bible and then you say I'm destroying you're destroying my my belief brother Dale I believe I got saved when I cried you got saved and then cried or maybe cried for you got saved why would Paul come along and say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed or having previously believed seeing you know what the new birth was so I know what the new birth you people have said well I'm a new worth it if it don't fit the Word of God let's see then I give the new birth to everybody every age every time because it's the birth of the word then Martin Luther already being supposingly a Christian then God spoke to him about the just shall live by faith John Wesley already converted under Luther's message into a Christian teaching into insane and he comes to America to convert in it and gets here and gets the message of sanctification right already believe in it he was saved already believe in Luther's message of the just shall live by faith - the age started condemning the people for doing what Luther was doing drinking a beer and sitting in the pub - places you don't not have been doing and God started through Wesley condemning those things so what is the new bar what - brother Dale I'm gonna walk up the altar and see that's where people think that I'm I'm off about you come up to the order to be pray for for the baptism when the older goes you want to get everybody around and get them emotional shouting and praying and hollering and little random says do not speak in tongues when you're praying for people to receive the Holy Ghost and time you need that quote he said because you get their mind on the wrong thing and he said I've heard people speak in tongues and call on the devil see do you know what the new birthday is well you've destroyed all of my things that I thought it was well good praise God we got that done now what are we going to do about it see now we can start thinking about a growth development of a Christian that was never taught in the organized religions and things may be a little bit here a little bit there may be a thought yeah we knew the Bible said being born again I knew that another Baptist Church I could read the Bible but see now we need to growth development why because ever born-again believer is born again as a baby but I was six years old I said I ain't got nothing to do with it you get born again you're a baby you ain't got no teeth well the Bible says we're supposed to drain the help and not to eat meat and the baby don't have no teeth right a natural baby doin okay a spiritual baby don't have no teeth you drink the milk right you're a baby I don't like to be called a baby I've been in this message long and brother Dale have I tell you what that's crazy god I hope so but what good is it done that's the only question I ask ever person that's born again is born again the same make sure you follow what I'm saying it's the same for everybody the difference in the attributes of what we do afterward is a lot of difference one shouted one cried one smoking dog wonder that's why if you don't have the new birth you don't know what it is is that plain enough if you don't have the new burro you don't know what the new birth is okay we'll go back down there hordes three thousand there was three thousand I got site then we take a trip over to next country we get over to our say wants a new bar wasn't Virginie where I don't know what about new bar that's exactly the way we are let's see everything we think figured out and then somebody comes along and says something I never will forget brother moat ears ago he he wanted to go to a long story but he wanted to go to a meeting they were having all right the meeting they were having was a convincing and they were having it was about the new birth you know I knew he couldn't hit me do it anyway he needed some water pipes and in fixing inside of the house from different things I said why don't you just go to the meeting and I'll do the work that way we'll get God working both ways I'll get you fixed and your house stopped leaking and all this things and you can go up there maybe they might be somebody you can talk to cuz he didn't go knowing he was gonna preach but he goes up and someone finds him very nice ride brother mold let's get him to preach tonight he said you preach it on the new bar yeah first night he preached justification oh they wanted to hear more second night he preached sanctification see all the brothers was giving up there they were scheduled to preach you know and once he preached that justification they've never heard it like to have chopping off you pie sins where does nothing do you feel sure enough you know and he begin to bring it out and in life and things I'm sure well see they begin to give up their position to let him preach so he preached justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost I'm sure a lot of people caught a lot of things would you know what you know was invited to come back because once he explained it it's like what I'm explaining or trying if it's not your shout and it's not your crime that was not the new birth that was an aftereffect of the birth the birth was the word you had heard and took that word in the gospel that said they took the word and held it the Holy Ghost could come in quicken that word Darcie new birth what you're doing the way I ain't done away with nobody shouting crying or nothing I believe in it I'll quote you the Prophet a stillborn baby is dead that's paraphrasing but it's close enough stillborn baby is a dead baby there's going to be emotions with the new birth anything that doesn't have an emotion with it it's not a new birth you sound like you against this but now you will rejoice and have a good time in our salvation but to remember what our salvation is it's the same as everybody in the Bible all the way down and saying whether prophet trying to explain it you go to the prophets message and show me I'm asking you to come show me where he ever taught anything about emotionalism isn't he in the new birth he's their way with experience as a measuring rod as a measuring rod not a way with experience because he never taught to do away with the experience he said if you have looking at yesterday he said if you have the new birth you've had an experience you can't have the new birth without having an experience because that's something you live through over and over till you get it ever born-again believer is born the same it's the birth of the word they heard and ever born-again believer starts out as a baby not courting allit what age they are or even the amount of word some theologian come in here and he'd say brother Dale I wanna I wanna I'm not I realize I'm not saved that's our okay let's take care of that we pray for salvation but I tell him right real quick when you get the Holy Ghost it ain't gonna put you in the pyramid of it to top you may be able to talk about things but it ain't gonna put you that God is gonna come and put you there and then you can talk about being born again then you can use the scriptures that we were talking about the other day well as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that wears no one desiring the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby now how many of you feed your babies a piece of steak when it's two weeks old it ain't got no teeth you ain't got no ability you can now and shuck off of it but you know I think come on folks we've raised up in the time when we didn't have all the baby foods and something my wife would take the kids meal and you know beans or whatever it was and squish it all up and do it up and feed it to her and they left surprisingly but you know what I'm talking about you go give the spoon and the beans to the kid II don't know anything about it if it's two days old get it right on what we're talking about the natural is always the type of the spiritual right see seeing you're out purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit John finding love of the Brethren that you love one another with appear art being born again what not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever 1st Peter 1 in 23 22 what do you get with a new birth what we've done about Wednesday it's the earnest of the spirit into our hearts when you get the new birth you get the new birth there's an earnest you don't get it in a full grown well I've got it further up than rest y'all what made you that way I just gave the illustration put the theologian down there I'm gonna tell him hey how old are you I'm 80 years old and I got 12 years in college good you're a little baby you need some sugar tits you need milk well I know I was about to work you know the letter don't throw it away with the letter of it under what you had didn't bring it across right see the earnest of the spirit seasons 114 which is the earnest of our inheritance what until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory the new birth is an earnest of part payment and everbody started that away except 120 120 you got a defier with a prophet he said they had these virtues so you go with that he said but he didn't have the headstone so we go with that before anybody runs our computers and uh uh you know gets to be a brain to running I don't say and I'm just this is me maybe not all the hundred and 20s in the upper room not the Holy Ghost it's at hospice ition worse the Holy Spirit because it's according to how much word you know it's according to how much understanding you know it will get to that you said well I believe 120 well that's all right I'm not our again we I'm just being sensible if they were not tutored and trained they didn't get what the rest of them not okay but they got the new birth but everything down stars in the 3000 everything was they know was a baby when it's born again I don't care who it is worth what it's a baby according to the Bible Paul must have understood that because he constantly spoke of the earnest he spoke of those things about how he was just a baby what about a great theologian like the Apostle Paul and all of his doing and he turned out to be a baby he goes through the backside of the desert takes what Scrolls he has and what thing and when he come out of the higher he was preaching the same thing Peter was that's why I've tried to illustrate it over the years try my best to get you to see Paul tells us about adoption but he doesn't break it down to how to do this and do that other than desire the sincere milk of the word do you my girl Peter says add to your faith virtue see now they're in the right order and run around said Peter and Paul had no difference in doctrine are you listening which is the earnest of our inheritance I have fed you with milk Paul says he says you're even as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat or hitherto you were not able to bear it neither he says now then we have many things to say it hard to be understood which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and become such as have need of milk and not a beat what about talking to the Hebrews they were supposed to be anchored in the word and he's now telling them that their babies let's go ain't no baby yes see that's what I'm saying go ahead strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those who are by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil what about it what about it a baby sister Barbara said she had a dream years ago that people around here one would do this and out of the other and she'd see me I don't want I have them up on my shoulders well I'm just honest to say if you'd have seen it you just been a bunch of babies well brother they are you calling us babies does that offend you it don't offend me whatsoever for you to call me a babe in Christ you have given me the greatest honor that any human being could pleasure would be the fact that I would be considered a newborn baby in the kingdom of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the life of Christ living in me thank God called me a baby let's grow up right let's grow up to getting our feelings hurt about everything like let's grow up quit being babies hey folks that's when a lot of people used to laugh at me they said how in the world can you preach the way you do brother they'll and I'm talking about back when brother mote was the pastor said how can you throw me people outside not necessarily here said you mean you preached with him in the depth of his understanding of the Word of God in the message I said thank God I said if I go wrong he can correct me if I preach it wrong he can show me where I'm I need to get straightened out I wanted to preach it that away that's what wouldn't bother me to it I'll say it this way forever theologian is in this message to sat down and let me talk to him about the new birth and wouldn't bother me at all but it might bother them for me to tell him a bunch of babies cause they getting upset about what I'm saying so if you getting upset it proves your baby right you say glory hallelujah now me how to grow up because the Bible says to grow up in him a bunch of babies but let's say that's I I try my best you called me deeper then I try my best to stay with the greatest simplicity they try to bring something because I know where all babies bless good ain't no baby you fended me if I offended you by saying that you are not a born-again believer is that strong enough well you're doing away now with my belief is or what I thought was salvation you kind of got me away from from the shouting and all these other things now I've got it anchored I'm in the message being in the message don't make a birth it's when the message is revealed to live in you and me there's a birth and in no way was preaching we're brother Brandon would say this message we this bride is to be delivered of a new birth from Malachi 4 you realize that new birth is not gonna be a baby form not in this day it may start out is there but it's gonna be a growth development what about it to me I enjoyed there the other night preaching about were because I knew brother I meant talked about the white button I knew he talked about the little spot in you but it just really hit me and I started reading the things brother Brennan said about since when you were born again believer he said it's like a little button life inside of you he calls it eternal life well I thought I got this field well if you got filled how are you gonna get any of this I mean if you come out of it for well I got a new birds that I was filled with his spirit like I've always said I give honor where on earth do but I tell it like it is brother mold in nineteen in 70 or 71 right in there brother calling him started coming he started preaching on the statue of a perfect man my waist have God everybody in the world would have heard those services when he finished I asked him one simple question listen now we believe what you teaching leave everything about it you got it laid out right cause that's what he said in the book he read it yeah I said we don't ask you a simple question now how do I get those virtues the rudder brownie in the statute of perfect man doesn't tell you verbatim how to get those virtues he tells you of a growth he tells you of being born again during but he doesn't tell you the direct Avenue to follow I went from 7480 about nineteen eighty the Lord revealed it not come and preached how do you get those mergers through the opening of the word if the new birth is the opening of the word then the growth development is the opening of the word right see then you can see how the Prophet done it I'll make this statement and then quit on you can see how he done and all of those years in his preaching he's preaching in 56 on the Intervale talking about a living moving instrumentality because he knew the Pentecostals had cabbage down on the new birth and was not bringing it you know into the fullness he could see that he begin back in those early years I ask you if you will to just take your message if you want to be something to assign to you to study I'm just starting about 19 and 61 and listen to ever take from 61 really 60 60 up to 62 when he preached statue of a perfect man and if you listen to it you'll see that he kept growing and kept growing income before he gets to the statue of a perfect man he said this come to me just the other day out in the woods one second Peter he's up on what I was studying on it's all those years he was trying to preach the statue of a perfect land will reach some of those thing we did it to other excuse me the other day on that one work was talking about the Messiah know about growing growing growing holy he began in that light that early part of the sixties to dig in deeper and deeper the people begin to pull away because he didn't know what he was saying when he begin trying to bring the birth and he would make statements like him in mmm-hmm he's one of them you must be born again one her he said I can conclusively prove that you are born again and then baptized into the body I remember when that winter Island it's still going around they can't figure out what he's talking about simple matter you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost your growth development is your baptism into the body further the gifts and the different things of the body of Christ as a adopted manifested child very simple all of those things bring them to me it's when it sounds contrary bring them to me we'll just sit down and take my book let you read it where I wrote the side of it what he's saying well I'm because I'm concerned there's not a one of them own are they getting answered why I brought around them who said things the way he did he didn't say it wrong he said it right we missed it then one day he coming he preached the statue of perfect Manny's have been 30-some years to bring this good you see there's no way then to get this because you just study it out but through the opening of the seals which is the fight the last advancement in the message right here regardless what you want to call it third pull tenth visions whatever you want to call it run through you gonna have to agree with me that the seals finalized at all and those seals finalizing is the headstone to the church they will take her out of here it'll bring those virtues into being well you mean to tell me I've got to study the seals get the virtuous I believe it that's what I've told since 1980 and that's what I'm still teaching that you're gonna have to have the opening of those seals to be able to receive the virtues of the statute of a perfect man cause you and I are not prophets but a random was a prophet and God could open those things to him but you and I are not a profit think on these things we'll pick it up this evening from right there what that little button come on musician a little button begins to grow that little button is eternal life well watch the rest of it in there you see you think how many friends are the other night when I was reading with read around talking about the growing and growing and growing well I mean I got the bird I got the bird he says you can still have bitterness and you were born again believer I know why I know what no no no well that's what I'm saying you're cutting yourself oh no he's the one who said I did he goes to doors in doors listen to them and he says there's places that we have God cut off from in our soul and he said some of it is pride different Sun one was real strong he said one of them is faith he said now God don't you fool with my faith I've got this right not know what to do don't you fool my faith read the messages listen to the prophet see if he said what I said then your heart but think on these things one thing for certain mother Dale please all born-again believers are born again at faith must have the new birth which is the earnest of our inheritance let's grow in grace and knowledge of the stature of a perfect man come out to a place to be adopted and then from there were going to the change of the body brother Branham said it the Bible said the last thing is what the resurrection the resurrection is a life phase of adoption according to Roman's a not 2324 to wit do you understand the redemption of our body let's stand together thank on these things I believe the new birth is the same for everybody go ahead but everybody but we're not all the same I got where the Prophet said he said now even our noses there he said we're all different he didn't say we had a different God he said because if I cording to her growth development you see how simple it is to preach the new word preach Jesus Christ
