[2:37] heart from here uh if not I may try to
[2:40] preach something so that we'll go one
[2:43] way or the other you know whatever it
[2:45] would do if you like turning your
[2:46] scriptures turn to Matthew 19
[2:50] where we've been reading and from Romans
[2:54] 7 Matthew 19 Romans 7.
[3:03] are dear heavenly father we thank you
[3:05] Lord for an opportunity of coming out
[3:07] tonight and thank you for
[3:09] for me and you and revealing yourself
[3:12] unto us Lord that we may see you by the
[3:15] opening of our eyes Lord we know we
[3:18] can't open our natural eyes without
[3:19] strength from you and neither can our
[3:22] spiritual lives be open without you
[3:24] doing it farce Lord we thank you for all
[3:26] things we thank you for the testimony we
[3:28] heard tonight and we pray that you would
[3:31] just blessed each one and encourage us
[3:33] all to seek after you and to want to be
[3:37] gathered together in your love as we
[3:39] read your word you come and speak to our
[3:41] hearts and our lives Lord that we may
[3:43] see you and want to walk in your grace
[3:46] and your love
[3:47] remember the come on this he said
[3:49] you sent your word and healed us and
[3:51] delivered us from destruction so we
[3:53] believe that you'll do that unto us
[3:55] tonight have your way now in Jesus name
[3:58] amen
[4:01] 19.
[4:03] we'll read
[4:05] three through nine and then we'll go to
[4:07] Romans 7 and we meet okay
[4:13] the Pharisees came unto him tempting him
[4:15] and saying I drew him is it lawful for a
[4:19] man to put away his wife forever cause
[4:21] and he actually didn't show them to them
[4:23] have you not read that he which made
[4:26] them at the beginning made them male and
[4:28] female
[4:29] and said for this cause shall a man
[4:31] leave father and mother
[4:34] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[4:36] shall
[4:37] they Twain she'll be one flesh wherefore
[4:40] they are no more Twain but one flesh but
[4:42] therefore God hath joined together let
[4:45] not and put asunder they say unto him
[4:49] why did Moses then command to give her
[4:51] writing a divorcement and to put her
[4:53] away
[4:54] he said unto them Moses because of the
[4:57] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[5:00] put away your wives but from the
[5:01] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[5:04] you who shall say unto you whosoever
[5:06] shall put away his wife except it be for
[5:08] fornication
[5:09] and she'll marry another committed to
[5:11] the adultery this will marry her which
[5:13] is put away does commit adultery now if
[5:17] we get this far According to which way
[5:18] we go okay
[5:20] Romans
[5:21] seven
[5:24] will you not brother and for I speak to
[5:25] them that know the law how that the law
[5:27] has dominion over a man as long as he
[5:29] liveth but the ones which happened
[5:31] husband is bound by the law to her
[5:33] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[5:36] husband be dead she is loose from the
[5:38] law of her husband so then if while her
[5:41] husband liveth she'll be married to
[5:43] another man she shall be called an
[5:45] adulteress whenever her husband be dead
[5:47] she is free from that law so that she
[5:49] has no adulteress so she be married to
[5:52] another man or for my brethren you also
[5:55] are become dead to the law by the body
[5:58] of Christ
[5:59] that you should be married to another
[6:01] even to him who is raised from the dead
[6:03] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[6:06] God
[6:07] for when we were in the flesh the
[6:09] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[6:11] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[6:13] unto death but now we are delivered from
[6:16] the law now how
[6:18] that being dead
[6:21] try
[6:22] we're in
[6:25] we were hail in other words now the only
[6:27] way you can be delivered from the law is
[6:29] to be dead yeah right right I mean that
[6:33] frees you from the law okay now they
[6:35] can't arrest my daddy for something he
[6:37] died in 1945 see
[6:39] we kind of hard to make a cash against
[6:41] him now well because he's dead all right
[6:45] but now we are delivered from the law
[6:47] that being dead we're in we were held
[6:50] that we should serve in a newness of
[6:51] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[6:54] letter you may be seated the Lord have
[6:56] his blessings to the reading of the word
[6:58] now let me ask you because it'll
[7:01] determine what we do
[7:03] does anybody have any more questions I
[7:06] have a few
[7:08] and do you have any comments questions
[7:10] or something that you'd like to write
[7:12] down in for us to cover tonight you know
[7:15] in what we're doing and all so uh you
[7:19] know
[7:20] if not we'll try to Maybe cover these
[7:23] and then maybe it'll stir up something
[7:25] in you but I'm just asking you if you
[7:27] have anything then that way we can we
[7:29] can uh cover those points of interest of
[7:33] what we've been doing with and what
[7:35] we've been talking about now we have
[7:38] been talking about
[7:39] marriage and divorce
[7:41] we've been talking about what is a
[7:43] marriage
[7:44] it is what this when a girl a boy asked
[7:46] a girl to marry she accepts they're
[7:48] married all right then what is a divorce
[7:51] to break that wording that you've made
[7:53] it's not to go down to the justice of
[7:56] the peace that's the natural Act of
[7:58] things that are taking place are to the
[8:00] court you know Etc whatever you would
[8:03] have to go to uh that would be uh doing
[8:06] it but it's basically just to break your
[8:09] vow that you made to one another all
[8:12] right you see then in doing that then we
[8:14] covered in our life's message that uh
[8:18] you know there was no grounds for her
[8:21] whatsoever to divorce her husband and to
[8:24] remarry because that would would be
[8:27] contrary to the scriptures
[8:29] but it's not said about him
[8:33] and uh not being said about him then we
[8:36] had to find out what
[8:38] would be the things or what how could a
[8:42] man you know
[8:43] have a right to put away his wife and
[8:46] and marry again what would be the
[8:48] grounds or what would be the the uh the
[8:51] points and we tried to cover that from
[8:53] there in uh Matthew of 19 and 9 and
[8:58] um Matthew 5 32 where we were talking
[9:02] about that one says that if man puts
[9:05] away his wife except Matthew 19 9 it be
[9:07] for fornication and marriage again he'll
[9:10] commits adultery all right then we went
[9:13] through Matthew 5 32 it says saving for
[9:16] the cause
[9:18] all right so there's no grounds that the
[9:20] man can just come along and say I can
[9:21] just put my wife away for anything
[9:24] all right now if you don't agree with me
[9:26] on what I'm preaching about it that's up
[9:29] to you uh I've preached this for 40
[9:32] years and I've stood with it on the
[9:34] grounds of what I believe and you know I
[9:37] continually stand on that ground it's
[9:39] not something to just any cause
[9:42] of anything oh my God I forget to turn
[9:45] or something oh I hope you don't turn
[9:46] this up oh okay right yeah okay we get
[9:50] the right lid on the right jug we're all
[9:52] right
[9:53] maybe I made it you just pray for us
[9:55] children so coughing and hacking and
[9:58] everything else but don't worry about it
[10:00] all right but it's good to see sister
[10:03] Trudy here on Wednesday night that's
[10:05] that's something for her to get to be
[10:07] down this way where she can be here in
[10:09] the Wednesday night services and praise
[10:11] the Lord for that okay we've been
[10:13] praying about that for what how many
[10:15] years you've been coming here 20
[10:16] something years and she's been praying
[10:18] for to come down this way now she's down
[10:20] here so we thank God for that right all
[10:22] right let's see what is the grounds now
[10:24] that the man can put away his wife it
[10:26] can only be
[10:28] because saving and accept is the same
[10:31] word using we gave the definitions we
[10:33] gave the understanding and it's not just
[10:36] because that she's this or she's that
[10:39] we went through it that the only grounds
[10:42] is for the fact of fornication all right
[10:45] then we went through from from that of
[10:48] fornication saying that the people of
[10:50] the message uh they accept fornication
[10:53] as being uh before marriage you know and
[10:57] you could put away your wife and Mary
[10:59] again which we gave a couple of quotes
[11:01] for that you know that it wrote around
[11:03] said it could be done
[11:04] and she told you 10 years after they
[11:06] were married you could you know the man
[11:08] could do that all right but then uh you
[11:12] know as we were going along then uh I
[11:15] told you I said there's not a quote you
[11:17] see you're saying you're
[11:18] self-interpreting your thoughts on the
[11:20] message no I'm just telling you what I
[11:23] believe amen
[11:24] amen if if you don't agree with it
[11:26] that's all right because we gave where
[11:29] the Prophet said adultery fornication
[11:31] what could be the same word he gave the
[11:33] definition of fornication as being a
[11:36] girl before marriage you know and
[11:38] adultery as being uh someone that is
[11:41] married and runs around with a man you
[11:43] know and that's adultery all right but
[11:45] then we went back to show the
[11:47] connections and I hope he was following
[11:49] it of how that
[11:51] brother Brown said eve committed
[11:53] adultery
[11:55] well now you know they had never come
[11:58] together they had never been to the
[12:00] point of of what we label on our
[12:03] thoughts a lot of times being married so
[12:06] they had never come together that way
[12:08] and but he calls it adultery
[12:11] and he called it adulterer with Israel
[12:14] you know the Bible did and and that's
[12:18] you know our adulterous uh mother is
[12:21] what it is and we go over to Babylon and
[12:23] all the things you know and we can find
[12:25] it as would be an interchangeable word
[12:27] now I say then because I've made my
[12:30] statement I for to be what I say I
[12:33] believe adultery and fornication is an
[12:36] interchangeable word I know the
[12:38] definition of it and what it means but
[12:42] still adultery
[12:44] is fornication
[12:47] right because fornication means unclean
[12:50] living all right so then it would be you
[12:54] know fornication and adultery would be
[12:56] interchangeable and you know if you say
[12:59] well give me a quote I've told you told
[13:02] you that 40 years ago I searched the
[13:04] message and I can't find a quote for a
[13:06] brother around and says that you can put
[13:08] your wife away for committing a dog
[13:10] treat
[13:11] and marry again
[13:12] no I don't mind saying it that way
[13:15] because I'll try to tell you like it is
[13:18] but then when you come down to the point
[13:20] of seeing it you meet a man that can put
[13:22] his wife away for committing fornication
[13:24] because she comes and tells him because
[13:26] it's a lie and then she goes out and
[13:28] lives in adultery
[13:31] you know that he can't put her away and
[13:33] marry again well then God couldn't put
[13:35] Israel away in Mary again
[13:37] all right he couldn't put Luther in him
[13:39] away we gave the quote that he put the
[13:42] lutherans away and married to methodists
[13:45] all right
[13:46] because now we're bringing it over
[13:48] closer to a spiritual point of
[13:52] understanding then we're trying to hold
[13:55] it at the natural point of understanding
[13:57] but you know still I've tried to bring
[14:00] that down into show and to show that
[14:03] fornication then goes on down into
[14:05] unclean living we went through that why
[14:08] would a prophet then say that
[14:11] you can't just put your wife away for
[14:13] anything because she's an unbeliever or
[14:16] something he said Paul covered it that
[14:18] wouldn't be correct we gave her all of
[14:20] that all right and then she turned
[14:22] around and
[14:23] and say that for a woman to cut her hair
[14:28] it's fornication
[14:31] all right
[14:32] because she's dishonoring her husband
[14:34] which is her head
[14:36] and by that she just honors Christ which
[14:40] is his head and we went through that to
[14:42] show him you know that that that that
[14:44] would be then brother random wouldn't be
[14:46] saying like the Pharisees what we just
[14:48] put them away for anything
[14:49] well see it looks like he come over here
[14:51] and brought around this or well you you
[14:52] can't put away with this that the other
[14:54] may burn into bread but you put away
[14:55] cutting a higher won't somebody come
[14:57] along so well that's just about anything
[14:59] ain't it no it ain't no it's fornication
[15:02] amen
[15:04] see because you're an untrue wife I gave
[15:07] where the Prophet said you know those
[15:09] things but you cannot now
[15:13] for a woman cutting her hair you cannot
[15:15] put her away and marry again I gave two
[15:19] quotes of that to show him and you know
[15:21] if you misunderstood me and thought I
[15:23] said other things that was the way you
[15:25] go back and listen to the tape that the
[15:28] statement is there there's two quotes
[15:30] were brought around and says you cannot
[15:31] remarry because of putting your wife
[15:34] away for cutting her hair
[15:36] all right so you you you can't do that
[15:39] that's that would go out it's got to be
[15:41] the natural part
[15:44] but yet the spiritual part of
[15:46] fornication is so close
[15:48] right until it's real you know run
[15:51] around discerned out remember the
[15:52] brother that time and thought he was
[15:54] running around on his life and to come
[15:56] find out he's playing around with
[15:57] organized religion
[15:59] and see then that's how close it is to
[16:02] coming down to a a situation amen Mark
[16:06] now then
[16:09] in covering that then we see that it's
[16:11] not for just anything it's for
[16:12] fornication
[16:15] and run around said you can put her away
[16:16] you know for cutting her hair but he
[16:19] said if you want to
[16:21] Paul said now the unbeliever desires to
[16:25] live with you so that's fine
[16:27] you know we went through that coverage
[16:29] she desire to live we naturally she's a
[16:31] woman of the world she's going to be out
[16:33] cutting her hair and doing things you
[16:36] know because she's an unbeliever
[16:39] this year go ahead
[16:41] you see
[16:43] but see Adam had that situation that he
[16:46] could have done
[16:47] but yet he didn't force the situation
[16:50] and God was so lenient with Israel
[16:54] until he over and over and over
[16:57] extended his arm of Grace unto her
[17:01] amen and so has he done it down through
[17:03] the ages of extending that Grace to
[17:07] mankind whether it be Luther Wesley
[17:09] Pentecost whatever it be you know to
[17:11] show that point
[17:13] but
[17:15] you know we found and flatly determined
[17:18] that there's no grounds for her to
[17:20] divorce her husband and remarry now we
[17:24] went through it so we got a couple of
[17:26] points that we can cover that will go in
[17:28] there and I went through it to explain
[17:33] you know sometimes so let's just take a
[17:35] couple of the questions and then if we
[17:36] go through questions and we get tied up
[17:38] we'll go on if we don't we'll we'll try
[17:41] to cover a little bit of the talk
[17:43] because the Lord showed me something the
[17:45] other day awake to explain what I see
[17:47] and uh you know that'd be a preacher to
[17:50] do that to know what are you talking
[17:51] about he said well if you see it say it
[17:58] you know in putting that into words what
[18:01] you see in your heart all right but now
[18:04] here's the question so we'll get into uh
[18:08] some of the Natural Life
[18:11] can a woman divorce her husband
[18:14] not for the bases or the point that she
[18:16] wants to remarry
[18:18] but she can separate from him because of
[18:21] his wrongdoings
[18:24] all right he doesn't give her a right to
[18:27] get married again now go get that plane
[18:30] okay she doesn't have a right to marry
[18:32] again but she don't have to live in that
[18:35] situation amen
[18:37] I gave you the quote from Brother Brown
[18:39] said if you know you you either partner
[18:41] that I would be saying you know well you
[18:43] know I'm not going to put up with you
[18:44] going to church over there he said and
[18:47] you do what God leads you to do
[18:49] that all right and see the woman she
[18:51] don't have to live with a man that's
[18:52] beating her up and and doing all kind of
[18:55] things and treating her so dirty
[18:57] if you don't have to live with him she
[18:59] can separate from it amen
[19:02] but because of the situation in the
[19:04] garden and who started it it doesn't
[19:06] give her a right to go get married the
[19:09] only ground she has is according to
[19:11] Romans 7 and according to the prophet of
[19:14] this day that we believe
[19:16] that her husband must be dead
[19:20] and that cannot be now that she becomes
[19:23] up and said well I'm a Christian so he's
[19:25] dead no no he still is it
[19:28] you got a problem he's still living so
[19:31] don't jump on the things and try to
[19:33] justify this or do that we're just
[19:35] trying to cover because really most
[19:38] preachers would most preachers would
[19:40] never say the things I've said through
[19:42] this series
[19:44] I'm not bragging I'm talking playing
[19:46] because they won't try to attempt to
[19:50] rectify things or get it in the right
[19:52] place just like they'll say well I I
[19:54] show you wherever I said you put her
[19:56] away for fornication but I can't show
[19:58] you where you put away for adultery so
[20:00] they just won't say those things
[20:01] all right well see I've always just been
[20:04] playing enough to tell you right and
[20:06] then you wouldn't verifying most of them
[20:08] saying that a woman could separate from
[20:09] her husband they tell her no you got to
[20:11] live with them
[20:13] you got to live with them
[20:15] you know I didn't get personal here if
[20:17] you want to that a pastor in another
[20:19] church was telling a person that goes to
[20:21] this church
[20:22] then she had to go back and live with
[20:25] her husband because he wanted to
[20:27] I told her you don't have to do it not
[20:31] what he's doing right all right that
[20:34] judge's gonna be on me and I told the
[20:36] brother I said you need to stay out of
[20:38] this situation
[20:39] if he hears his tape let it be but I
[20:41] told him but plainly I said you need to
[20:44] stay out of this because you don't know
[20:45] the whole story he said well I'm trying
[20:48] to get him converted I said yeah I've
[20:49] tried for a long time to get him
[20:51] converted too
[20:53] but I said you need to stay out of it
[20:55] because I'm telling it see and I told
[20:59] her I said you don't have to live in
[21:01] that condition so then we got some
[21:02] questions that'll relate to that and we
[21:04] can cover part of it and and do whatever
[21:07] to do it all right the question it's I
[21:09] don't know I'm divided it in uh about
[21:13] five just six different parts but
[21:16] it all kind of ties together so just
[21:18] listen if the husband commits adultery
[21:21] continuously
[21:23] what step can the wife take
[21:27] now if the husband continually commits
[21:30] adultery what step can the wife take
[21:33] separate from it right I mean I swear
[21:35] I'll believe it I don't believe she's
[21:37] got to live in that garbage now
[21:39] especially today
[21:40] when he's out there running around and
[21:42] brings all kind of venereal diseases and
[21:44] and AIDS and everything else home to her
[21:48] right now I don't agree with that at all
[21:50] I don't care who out there hears it you
[21:52] know and you send me email do what you
[21:54] want to that's just plain old me I was
[21:57] raised an old and stubborn way and I'm
[22:00] still stubborn I guess
[22:01] but I'm just playing about it too so you
[22:04] show me in the Bible word
[22:07] no now you come and show me in the Bible
[22:10] the prophets message whether the woman's
[22:12] got to live with a man that's out
[22:13] running around all over the country and
[22:16] that today like getting venereal
[22:17] diseases to bring it home to his wife
[22:20] now don't give her no grounds to get
[22:22] married again so keep on I'll keep
[22:24] saying that over and over
[22:26] but she don't have to live with him
[22:27] right if he beats her up he does things
[22:30] wrong to her she don't have to live with
[22:32] it well what's she gonna do brother Dale
[22:35] she didn't get a legal separation
[22:39] a legal separation from him and demand
[22:42] the court to make him pay child support
[22:45] Etc
[22:46] well she can't get child support unless
[22:48] she divorces him
[22:52] that's very close
[22:54] you know
[22:56] very close
[23:01] but see Church we're talking as I tried
[23:03] to bring out
[23:04] the other day
[23:06] this marriage and divorce situation is
[23:08] not talking about the world right it's
[23:11] not the people of the world right it's
[23:13] not the people of denominationalism
[23:17] marriage and divorce has never been
[23:19] offered to nobody but to the Bride of
[23:21] Jesus Christ that's right and that's
[23:23] been here in the end times it wasn't
[23:24] brought down Through the Ages
[23:27] and only spoke of it amen
[23:30] the grace of Salvation spoke of a Grace
[23:33] to come on marriage and divorce yes but
[23:35] it was not granted until the end time
[23:39] there's only granted three times that's
[23:41] Moses Hall and brought around to you and
[23:43] I in the end time to straighten it all
[23:45] up and I told you the reason it was
[23:47] granted is because we got to get these
[23:49] bodies straight amen that's right
[23:52] see now we believe well we're going to
[23:54] give us a new body we don't have to
[23:55] worry about it
[23:59] so it's going to be this body all right
[24:02] now watch Step can the woman take
[24:05] if her husband continually commits
[24:07] adultery I say she can withdraw herself
[24:10] from him
[24:12] get out
[24:15] you say well horror where can she go
[24:17] well there's a lot of offerings free
[24:19] things nowadays to take care of a lot of
[24:21] that stuff
[24:22] and a lot of good laws today take care
[24:24] of him
[24:26] all right and I would be the first one
[24:28] to stand up if somebody went with it
[24:30] I'll go right with you to court and say
[24:31] this is the grounds this is what she's
[24:33] talking about
[24:38] because it would be the wrong time
[24:41] now
[24:42] that's why I just have to make it plain
[24:44] and what can I do you know
[24:46] now the next part part of it it says
[24:49] that Shepherd if she does sheep or take
[24:52] of his sin by taking him back
[24:57] you know the first part was what grounds
[24:59] could you do all right does she partake
[25:02] of his sin by taking him back
[25:05] well I'm just on it
[25:08] playing honest whether you like it or
[25:11] not
[25:12] if my wife went out and run around with
[25:14] somebody she would have to have a test
[25:17] done before me and her would go back as
[25:19] husband and wife
[25:21] and I think the man the same way
[25:24] you know what kind of test I mean she
[25:27] would be tested for all kind of venereal
[25:29] diseases and you know
[25:33] and all this AIDS and everything else
[25:35] and I think the man ought to do that
[25:38] right
[25:39] if one of your sisters going to told me
[25:41] he said my husband's confessed or wrong
[25:43] to me what should I do I said tell him
[25:45] to go to the doctor and get a test
[25:47] number one
[25:50] because we don't you can surely be not
[25:53] partaker of his sin like you take heart
[25:55] but you be partaker because you're going
[25:58] to be wind up with AIDS out of the old
[26:00] guy or some kind of a narrow disease
[26:03] huh
[26:06] is that too plain
[26:08] or is it the truth
[26:10] what do you think about it
[26:14] does she partake of his sin by taking
[26:17] him back not not
[26:19] get the point we settled out about the
[26:21] venereal disease that's known
[26:23] and I said okay now let's get down to
[26:26] this point
[26:28] she you can forgive them and take them
[26:30] back you're not partaking of their sin
[26:33] right right you're not taking part of
[26:36] her of the person's sin whether it be
[26:38] woman or man
[26:40] I mean
[26:41] so then you're not taking on yourself
[26:45] some sinful thing
[26:48] if your husband said forgive me and you
[26:50] forgave them and took him back or the
[26:52] wife should forgive me you took her back
[26:54] then you're not partaking of their sin
[26:56] you're not guilty of what they were
[26:59] guilty of right amen the only thing you
[27:03] do is that's it partake of the natural
[27:05] thing
[27:07] and it would cause a problem but you you
[27:10] you're it wouldn't be that you're
[27:11] partaking of that you're it it don't
[27:14] come fall back on you
[27:17] it's on them
[27:20] and if they can straighten it up God
[27:21] will forgive them all right we'll go
[27:23] right away all right
[27:25] number three what do you do if the
[27:29] husband
[27:31] will not bring the other woman to
[27:33] confess like brother Brown suggests
[27:37] now you know what road around say it
[27:39] anybody that needs this we'll be glad to
[27:41] show you that brother Brown said what
[27:43] you do if you're trying to straighten up
[27:44] a marital situation
[27:47] a husband you know he's done the dirty
[27:49] thing he went out committed adultery
[27:51] he's supposed to go get the woman and
[27:53] bring her to his wife and confess it
[27:56] right there
[27:58] same thing for the woman you know she
[28:00] commits adultery she's supposed to go
[28:01] get the man right and bring the man in
[28:04] and sat down
[28:06] and explain it he said well why is that
[28:10] necessary because it cleans up a lot of
[28:12] things and ignition
[28:15] it shows an honesty
[28:18] about the person that's doing it right
[28:21] shows that they want to get it straight
[28:23] you understand
[28:24] all right you see what I wrote around
[28:26] with saying that's the way you do it
[28:29] now if the husband and wife and a man
[28:31] run around or the woman running around
[28:33] whatever
[28:34] side between yourselves
[28:37] that you don't want to go any further
[28:39] then right that wouldn't be nobody
[28:41] else's business that's right amen
[28:45] you know if I run around on my wife and
[28:48] I wouldn't told her about it
[28:49] and she said well I don't care about
[28:51] talking to the woman I said okay but
[28:53] I'll be glad to go get because my point
[28:55] is
[28:57] are we serious enough to straighten up
[29:00] something correctly right
[29:04] come on women or come on men would you
[29:06] be willing to bring the woman or the man
[29:11] to try to straighten it up it was
[29:13] showing honesty in your heart
[29:15] the children you really want to
[29:17] straighten up right right not one day
[29:19] well honey I I run around on you but I
[29:22] know you'd forgive me it's all right you
[29:24] know we don't have to go no further do
[29:26] we now you don't want to straighten it
[29:28] up all right
[29:31] right
[29:33] be willing
[29:35] say honey no it's not our one you know
[29:38] honey
[29:40] run around and said this was the way to
[29:41] do it
[29:44] and if you want me to we'll go do it
[29:48] I'm actually just as honest as I can
[29:49] what are you what's your answer that's
[29:51] right
[29:53] but see then the person on the other
[29:54] side could make the decision of whether
[29:56] or not have to go any further
[30:00] I mean that's your sensual answer
[30:03] but you need to be willing
[30:07] you know
[30:08] you need to be willing
[30:12] that would show the the repentance that
[30:14] would show the the point that you are
[30:16] trying to straighten up
[30:20] you know we don't have to go no further
[30:23] do we huh
[30:24] I'd be like the lady you know said I
[30:26] received the Holy Ghost last night but
[30:28] don't tell nobody
[30:30] well you know what runaround said about
[30:31] that wasn't it
[30:33] he said he doubted she got it right
[30:34] right well if you're not willing to
[30:37] straighten up
[30:40] then you're not trying to be sincere
[30:42] okay
[30:48] so then I hope that answers that now
[30:49] I'll go through these and then come back
[30:51] and let you whatever
[30:54] now is it unconfessed sin
[30:57] our misbehavior
[31:00] if the wife withholds what the husband
[31:03] is doing wrong
[31:05] while coming to church
[31:08] all right so now I get the question is
[31:11] it unconfessed sin or misbehaving
[31:14] if the wife withholds what the husband
[31:16] is doing wrong while coming to church in
[31:19] other words I assume the person is
[31:21] saying that the husband is still coming
[31:22] to church
[31:24] you know
[31:25] it doesn't mean the person being you
[31:28] know the woman in this case God had said
[31:30] about her husband uh you know
[31:32] whoa
[31:37] is it unconfessed sin or misbehavior no
[31:40] not unconfessed sin
[31:43] and it wouldn't be no misbehavior
[31:47] you know for her to withhold that her
[31:49] husband is doing wrong things yet coming
[31:51] to church
[31:53] that wouldn't be it wouldn't be no
[31:55] misbehavior wouldn't be no one confessed
[31:57] sin
[31:58] but eventually it ought to be stopped
[32:02] in the person in order to tell us okay
[32:04] now the wife to the husband husband to
[32:07] the wife okay
[32:09] we don't lay everything on the women on
[32:10] it
[32:12] they should say look are you still going
[32:15] to church acting like that
[32:17] because that's what Paul got into in
[32:19] Corinthians that the man was living with
[32:22] his father's wife in other words your
[32:24] stepmother you know all right I don't
[32:27] know what you'd call it his father's
[32:28] life
[32:29] and he was still in the church evident
[32:31] because Paul said when you come together
[32:34] against which one
[32:36] this guy was evidently coming to church
[32:38] and the way Paul explains it like and
[32:40] brother Brown and verse on it that in
[32:42] other words they were just kind of
[32:43] letting it ride and just kind of maybe
[32:45] even giggling about it and well that's
[32:48] okay I guess you know no it wouldn't all
[32:51] right
[32:53] I'm saying to you man I'm saying to you
[32:55] women
[32:57] your husband is not living right out
[32:59] there
[33:00] and still coming to church you're
[33:02] telling them
[33:04] you're the first one tell them
[33:06] all right
[33:08] now if they don't straighten up then
[33:10] come tell me about it then we'll see
[33:12] whether or not it needs to go before the
[33:14] church right right okay
[33:17] see don't go tell everybody in the
[33:18] community about it everybody in the
[33:20] church about it that's where the biggest
[33:21] problem with people is
[33:23] the biggest problem with people is they
[33:27] got to run their big mouth that's right
[33:30] and they can't just do it sensibly and
[33:33] quietly
[33:35] so they go to
[33:37] and Isaiah are sitting out there waiting
[33:39] on you
[33:40] yeah if I can say it when I come up here
[33:43] people to be prayed for these people sit
[33:44] back did you say they committed adultery
[33:48] when there's walking
[33:52] right
[33:55] now don't tell me that ain't done
[33:58] all right
[34:01] the silliness in people because you
[34:03] don't hear and you put in there your own
[34:05] words or what is saying
[34:07] don't laugh her husband even want her
[34:09] husband doing wrong talk to them first
[34:12] then come talk to me if we feel like
[34:15] going to the church with it we'll go to
[34:16] the church with it
[34:18] then we can explain it to everybody
[34:21] but instead of natural go explain it to
[34:23] everybody and you got everybody in the
[34:24] building on up on your side that's what
[34:26] you're trying to do
[34:28] you know the reason most people are
[34:30] called for crimes
[34:33] they can't stand to be alone
[34:36] so they want to tell somebody what
[34:38] they're done
[34:39] and I want you to say well that ain't
[34:41] too bad we all do things
[34:46] two times today in the funeral
[34:49] two preachers both of them said
[34:51] well none of us could say we're perfect
[34:53] or nothing
[34:56] you know so if you look in the mirror
[34:58] we're gonna find us all guilty well you
[35:00] know it's true
[35:01] but what's your point
[35:03] right right I want to talk about guilt
[35:05] or not guilt
[35:07] right
[35:08] all right is that understandable to keep
[35:10] these in mind if you don't like it then
[35:12] you can we'll get you in just a minute
[35:15] the point that goes with that one was
[35:17] would it be telling on her spouse
[35:22] in other words if she's not if the
[35:24] husband is doing something wrong and
[35:26] still coming to church
[35:29] would it be telling on her spouse
[35:31] you know well I mean I guess it would be
[35:34] but but
[35:36] like I said handle it in the right
[35:38] Channel
[35:40] there's a lot of things could be settled
[35:41] around here that wouldn't get to
[35:43] gossiping ears to running and the phones
[35:46] are ringing and that's what I mean when
[35:48] I say you stay on the phone over five
[35:51] minutes you're gossiping oh that's what
[35:53] I mean and you know what I mean by it
[35:56] it's not that you talk on the phone over
[35:58] five minutes I'm not talking about that
[36:00] I'm talking about gosh so
[36:05] because you know what you're going to do
[36:09] you know what it ain't none of your
[36:11] business what anybody else is doing
[36:12] that's as blunt as I can make it
[36:16] it ain't none of your what I want to
[36:18] pray for her
[36:20] if I don't know what to pray for how can
[36:24] I pray pray God bless them
[36:29] no you want to hear
[36:32] and solve a lot of things to get that
[36:34] gossiping here and here
[36:36] lust an ear off even
[36:39] that's right now you know you can't
[36:42] bring that up against this old boy
[36:44] that's right right you can come on
[36:48] you know this old boy don't tell
[36:50] everything
[36:53] because there's no need of it why
[36:58] but would it be that she's doing would
[37:00] she be telling on her spatiality she'd
[37:02] be telling on her spouses she'd come and
[37:04] told somebody about it
[37:06] yeah but would it be wrong to tell
[37:08] somebody according to who she's doubting
[37:10] I don't think in order to be putting an
[37:12] Anderson Independent do you
[37:14] all right
[37:15] or Atlanta concert tickets
[37:18] you know
[37:21] but do everything in rotten decently in
[37:23] order all right now you ask the question
[37:25] I'm just trying to answer the question
[37:29] you tell me not to tell nobody
[37:32] my wife don't know
[37:34] nobody's gonna know it that's right
[37:38] because I think that's where it ought to
[37:40] be right
[37:41] and I always remind you when you're
[37:44] leaving out I say if this gets out
[37:46] you'll know it didn't come from me
[37:52] okay
[37:55] because I don't run my mouth about it
[37:58] all right
[38:00] would it be telling on her spouse no
[38:04] but you're still a decently mentor
[38:08] you know let everything be done decently
[38:10] in order that's what I try to answer the
[38:11] question as much as I can cherishly in
[38:14] God
[38:16] but yet just plain common sense a lot of
[38:18] times handles a lot of things
[38:21] no
[38:24] it ain't none of our I think I don't
[38:26] like these uh chat rooms
[38:29] and I don't like these things it's on
[38:31] the computers and I will not fooling I
[38:33] know you know the the questions and
[38:36] answers
[38:37] and the things you know talking on it
[38:39] about the message
[38:42] you try Stephen Wilson one time he he
[38:45] went on there one day and looked and he
[38:47] told us years ago so it's all right
[38:49] he looked and somebody asked a simple
[38:51] question he thought man I can answer
[38:53] that he sat down and typed the answer
[38:55] back and back before he'd ever hit the
[38:57] button it was already about five coming
[38:59] his way
[39:01] that was Contra he said I shut it off
[39:03] and got out there
[39:06] but then you get on Facebook
[39:09] and everybody on Facebook's has got
[39:10] pictures of everybody
[39:12] and they got all their trouble yeah
[39:17] you know why
[39:18] because you're not looking somebody in
[39:19] the eye
[39:22] right
[39:24] and it's not as personal as a telephone
[39:26] you know what I mean it's more personal
[39:28] but it's not like a telephone person I'm
[39:30] really in a telephone can answer back
[39:31] once you're typing in there you know
[39:33] they can't answer you back
[39:36] they got to put their thoughts from
[39:38] there
[39:39] I don't like it I don't think it's right
[39:42] just as honest as I could be a man I
[39:44] don't think it's right I think it's a
[39:46] bunch of gosham
[39:50] there's people right here that knows
[39:51] more about what goes on this church than
[39:53] I do
[39:55] and I've told you if you know something
[39:58] in this church that is going on that I
[40:00] need to know if you don't tell me the
[40:03] sin is on you
[40:06] well I know somebody's committing
[40:08] adultery well you better get my office
[40:10] and let me know
[40:11] because if not that makes you guilty
[40:15] of sin
[40:22] what's wrong with that why not why can't
[40:24] we be playing on honest
[40:26] but I don't want to hurt nobody's feel
[40:30] I just don't but you know what the
[40:33] reason people won't come in my office
[40:34] about it because you know what I'll say
[40:36] to you have you got proof yep that's
[40:40] right my brother told me about this
[40:42] brother one time I said do you have any
[40:45] proof
[40:46] okay now
[40:52] no need talking no more on it
[40:55] when you get some proof you come tell me
[40:58] now I didn't mean proof that I meant did
[41:01] he see it
[41:02] all right you know that's hearsay in a
[41:04] court of law is not supposed to be
[41:05] allowed
[41:07] if somebody tells you something you
[41:08] don't tell her that's not allowed in the
[41:10] court of law
[41:11] they shouldn't be allowed in the church
[41:13] over for any time
[41:17] all right
[41:19] but now listen what about it
[41:22] now this other one is kind of a question
[41:24] that would be related to whether or not
[41:26] I go further or whether or not I stay
[41:28] here so anybody got any comments
[41:30] questions off the floor
[41:33] about what we've preached on marriage
[41:35] and divorce
[41:36] you know if they have we'll get the
[41:39] microphone or whatever we can get a hold
[41:42] of or you can have this one I'll go with
[41:44] this one
[41:45] you know
[41:46] does anybody got any comments
[41:50] any questions talk
[41:54] brother Dale why did you say so and so
[41:56] you know I'll do the best I can to
[41:59] answer you
[42:00] because I've always tried to it
[42:02] I don't know everything
[42:05] but I know somebody that knows
[42:07] everything right all we gotta do is get
[42:09] in touch with him and we'll all be able
[42:10] to pray down to live no matter
[42:13] so what about it
[42:16] you need comments on marriage and
[42:18] divorce
[42:20] he'll be different okay we got one
[42:24] I thought I heard you say that
[42:27] um Joseph took Mary San
[42:31] is that did I hear that the Joseph took
[42:35] Mary San
[42:37] Joseph to Mary sin couldn't marry sin
[42:41] yeah
[42:43] did Joseph take Mary sin did I hear you
[42:47] say that oh you're talking about Adam
[42:49] her jokes of sin no no okay I got you
[42:53] now now I may have misunderstood you
[42:55] right now see Joseph covered Mary
[42:59] you didn't partake of her sin okay all
[43:02] right I just missed and that was what I
[43:04] was trying to cover the question come
[43:05] out wrong right
[43:08] see Joseph by taking Mary that's why I
[43:11] said it had to be a married man man that
[43:14] she would have to be engaged to because
[43:17] if marriage just come out and said I'm
[43:19] going to have a baby
[43:20] they killed her
[43:23] it surely would have been God having to
[43:25] come down and do it but because of that
[43:27] of my off they cut it off and use it one
[43:30] use one on the full bed
[43:32] I'll cut this off
[43:35] now
[43:36] is it going out wrong or something yeah
[43:38] okay
[43:39] okay all right so then
[43:41] you know Joseph by receiving Mary
[43:45] he didn't protect a receipt because she
[43:47] didn't have anyone see she and I don't
[43:50] see him she didn't have nothing to to
[43:54] um
[43:55] you know any disloyalty or or any uh
[43:58] problem she was told a virgin and the
[44:01] eyes of the other people she would right
[44:03] exactly okay in the eyes of other people
[44:05] she was an adulteress and they told a
[44:08] story that she was you know uh
[44:11] had an affair with a soldier and that uh
[44:15] you know Joseph covered her and cook of
[44:17] that but now Joseph he just simply he
[44:21] knew the story that she was she was a
[44:23] virgin right and there was no wrong in
[44:26] what she had done all right so there's
[44:28] no sin involved in what she had done and
[44:31] there was no sin involved in him coming
[44:34] you know taking her
[44:36] and receiving her under himself and he
[44:39] didn't even have a relationship with her
[44:40] the whole time that she was pregnant
[44:42] with with Jesus so that was you know a
[44:45] good point but he did receive her and
[44:49] say I will protect her
[44:51] because under the law if a girl was
[44:54] pregnant they had to tell it and they
[44:56] killed him
[44:59] to being crucified killed
[45:03] but Joseph
[45:05] could stand in the plates the married
[45:07] man that's why it had to be a married
[45:08] man he wouldn't it you know it to me it
[45:11] would have been uh
[45:13] even worse to been maybe a young boy
[45:17] would not have understood a lot of them
[45:18] but Joseph was a fairly Old Gentleman
[45:21] that's right and God could talk to him
[45:24] and then talking to him then he told him
[45:26] you know that she's she's pregnant by
[45:30] the Holy Ghost In other words that child
[45:31] in her she wasn't pregnant about it
[45:33] because it was really just God created
[45:35] right there was no we used the word
[45:37] pregnant when you're using it for the
[45:39] basis of and it is pregnant she was but
[45:42] we use it because a manly woman you know
[45:44] right right which is that what you don't
[45:46] want so then he didn't partake of
[45:49] anything he covered her
[45:52] all right now just as Adam the in the
[45:55] beginning Now Eve was wrong
[45:58] right Steve was wrong she had done wrong
[46:01] and he covered her
[46:04] to refuse to allow her to be killed
[46:07] and took her to him said yes because
[46:09] that would have been an easy reason I
[46:10] said was it easy talking about it and
[46:13] then Joseph didn't clicked oh okay we're
[46:15] talking about huh
[46:19] anybody else
[46:24] sister Trudy
[46:28] have you got the thing or take take this
[46:32] okay
[46:33] I really don't know how to ask this
[46:36] question
[46:39] that has a little girl
[46:43] I knew a girl that was in her 20s and
[46:46] her hair came to the middle of her calf
[46:50] I'm wondering God truly would protect
[46:53] somebody is there an age when you
[46:58] and trim a little girl's hair
[47:03] and then as
[47:06] I can't get all other coaches it's not
[47:08] coming up here as good as it probably is
[47:11] and you're talking about a little girl
[47:13] that somebody cuts Your Heart Right
[47:17] somebody tell me because I can't hear it
[47:19] up here you're going to get a little
[47:21] louder it's probably me
[47:23] um
[47:24] would God allow a little girl a
[47:28] Christian family the little girl's hair
[47:30] to be cut
[47:31] to the point where she became a woman
[47:36] that's basically the question I had
[47:39] well if their mom and daddy cut your
[47:41] heart ain't nothing little girl can do
[47:44] so then you'd say would he allow it well
[47:48] um so you get into well that you protect
[47:50] your dish or protect it out he could
[47:51] protect her yeah but in most of the
[47:55] cases it wouldn't be a protection Mom
[47:57] and Daddy would be cutting the babies
[47:58] the girls higher and then when she got
[48:01] up to be a woman you know she could make
[48:03] her own decision
[48:05] all right
[48:06] and see then once she become to that her
[48:08] own decision it wouldn't be that her
[48:10] Daddy Mom was not a decision about
[48:12] cutting her hair
[48:14] is that basically what you're saying
[48:17] it was just that I knew somebody whose
[48:19] hair was so long and she was in her 20s
[48:21] I was wondering whether God would
[48:23] protect it from being a burden when you
[48:28] put that if that's his desire for a
[48:30] woman not to cut her hair I would think
[48:33] that he'd protect it I agree somebody
[48:35] did because either the mom and daddy
[48:37] said well we won't cut your hair you
[48:39] know
[48:40] they honored maybe the girl the girl
[48:42] said she didn't want her good you know
[48:44] and uh no
[48:46] and God would honor that but I'm still
[48:49] saying we're honest that we're the if
[48:51] the little girl was there in the home
[48:53] and Mom and Daddy demanded her hair to
[48:56] be cut they wouldn't be any sin of the
[48:58] little girl
[49:00] irregardless
[49:01] because it would be her mom and daddy or
[49:03] whoever you know the guardian's choice
[49:05] of doing it and then it wouldn't be any
[49:08] sin to the little girl until she'd come
[49:10] to her own age of
[49:12] maturity or whatever you know oh
[49:17] is that getting back because that's the
[49:18] best part and I'm getting to the
[49:19] question
[49:21] all right
[49:23] okay all right who'd win that
[49:29] all right
[49:31] right
[49:39] um
[49:40] I had this question at the Bible study
[49:43] and we didn't get around to our
[49:45] questions but uh
[49:47] uh I guess I should explain something
[49:49] before before I mention this question
[49:52] um
[49:53] uh this is not a quo for my friend
[49:55] question and uh and it's not a question
[49:59] for us either yeah I'll say this you
[50:01] know me and Gabby only held hands with
[50:03] each other
[50:03] I also uh you know we've had we had kids
[50:07] in other relationships but we've never
[50:08] kissed or anything
[50:11] um so this is not for me and it's not
[50:12] for a friend this is just curiosity
[50:14] right uh my question is for what
[50:17] Biblical reason can two people not live
[50:20] together as husband and wife as your
[50:23] engagement but before the wedding
[50:25] ceremony and I think I understood you
[50:27] already asked answered that really you
[50:29] said uh that the wedding is really not
[50:31] complete yet right that's not a complete
[50:34] wedding but they're already married in
[50:36] Gonzaga is married but the wedding's not
[50:39] complete right you know and but if they
[50:42] break though now if a boy and a girl
[50:45] engaged okay and God does the same as
[50:48] marriage all right if either one of them
[50:50] breaks that vow
[50:52] then they're guilty of adultery
[50:56] all right see the boy the girl if they
[50:58] break the vow that the that they made to
[51:01] each other because they become engaged
[51:03] that's the same as Mary
[51:05] all right
[51:06] now if that
[51:09] if they don't fulfill the wedding
[51:12] what is it going to be
[51:16] you understand
[51:18] I think so that could go on through life
[51:20] as being
[51:22] in nothing you know they'd be all right
[51:24] they could both stay virgin
[51:26] and everything would be okay
[51:30] but if either one of them breaks it
[51:33] then they've got the problem
[51:37] is that that the point you're making
[51:38] that yeah would be what and before I'm
[51:41] getting this year saying what would
[51:42] happen if they didn't go on with through
[51:43] the wedding well no no no my question
[51:45] was this uh why could they not all right
[51:48] biblically I won't like if if there's a
[51:51] scriptural reason as to why
[51:53] because to me in God's eyes they're
[51:54] already married I want to say once the
[51:57] man proposes and she accepts they're
[51:59] married in God's eyes so why could they
[52:01] not go and live together as husband and
[52:03] wife in other words well I answered that
[52:06] one oh okay I know that would be
[52:07] fornication right no I mean that's
[52:10] unclean religion
[52:11] um but around said the law gives you a
[52:13] right to live together see it would be
[52:17] unclean living for a boy and a girl to
[52:20] get engaged and go out and start having
[52:22] a sexual relationship right
[52:24] that would be unclean living that would
[52:27] be
[52:30] is just what I'm saying because it would
[52:33] be fornication
[52:35] in other words you both of them got two
[52:37] revved up and wrong directions all right
[52:40] and when they did they wind up and
[52:43] they'd get in the bed together well that
[52:44] don't that don't change nothing
[52:47] now sure they're married yeah
[52:49] they're married that's all right because
[52:52] they're married but when they asked
[52:54] and then by being married when they
[52:57] asked yeah but if they go live together
[53:00] in that time it would be unclean living
[53:02] okay because they haven't fulfilled all
[53:05] of their committals uh the vows at the
[53:09] wedding the uh the the preacher hasn't
[53:12] pronounced them so it would it would be
[53:14] unclean
[53:16] you know now we're talking about
[53:17] American Standard we're not talking
[53:19] about somewhere in Africa or something
[53:21] that they just say hey yeah let's do and
[53:23] they do you know we're not we're talking
[53:25] about
[53:26] the right way and they would do it the
[53:28] right way over there all right I'm
[53:30] coming back to you it's okay hold on
[53:32] she's trying to stay on not
[53:34] understanding I'm understanding what
[53:36] you're saying if the boy and the girl
[53:37] gets engaged why can't they go start
[53:39] living together
[53:41] oh
[53:45] let's see scripture
[53:47] um Paul and saying in the Corinthians
[53:50] that you're you're doing something
[53:52] unseemingly
[53:55] you know I'm trying to think of the
[53:57] scripture somebody can get it you're
[53:59] doing something unseemingly in other
[54:01] words you're you're not waiting until
[54:03] everything is finished
[54:06] um see because you are engaged but you
[54:10] haven't fulfilled rest of your part of
[54:12] being married engagement as far as God
[54:15] is concerned makes you married
[54:17] but it doesn't give you a right to go
[54:19] start living together
[54:21] now that's supposed to be after you go
[54:24] through the church vials you know and
[54:27] then the honeymoon comes that's supposed
[54:29] to be the time to live together
[54:32] and brother random says that the the
[54:34] first kiss or to be it the
[54:36] the doctor
[54:40] now you see then you wouldn't want to go
[54:42] very much further talking if you just
[54:44] said the first kiss or to be a dollar
[54:45] you know you wouldn't want to go into uh
[54:49] having a sexual affair
[54:51] between the boy and the girl even though
[54:53] they are married
[54:56] but it doesn't give them a right to go
[54:57] live together
[55:00] because see you can just write to
[55:01] somebody and say will you marry me and
[55:03] they say yeah Mary you well let's go to
[55:04] bed together and I would be unclean
[55:06] living
[55:08] you know that would be uh wrong in the
[55:12] eyes of God
[55:13] because it would be unclean living
[55:16] they wouldn't be waiting and fulfilling
[55:18] all the others you know and do it you
[55:21] know now even if you moved it to some of
[55:23] these in African situations or some
[55:25] foreign country situation you you go
[55:28] test these people about it and you'd
[55:29] find out that they say step step
[55:32] before you step over the stick
[55:35] and you can't violate that
[55:38] you know
[55:40] it would be that now let me get
[55:43] the law of the land
[55:44] for one reason
[55:49] well the law of the land tells you that
[55:57] because the law of the land that doesn't
[55:58] tell you it's okay to do whatever you're
[56:00] doing the law of the land says that uh
[56:04] you know they just give you the license
[56:08] and run around would use it and say as a
[56:10] right to live together as husband and
[56:12] wife
[56:13] it's the paperwork you sign
[56:15] but see we're going back as I said we're
[56:17] not dealing with the law we're dealing
[56:19] with the scriptural situation that the
[56:22] boy and girl is married
[56:24] and them being married
[56:26] doesn't give them right to go live
[56:28] together
[56:30] they need to go on through the wedding
[56:32] you know you understand what we're going
[56:34] to say married I say married is your
[56:36] engagement so if a boy and girl is
[56:38] engaged they should not have sexual
[56:41] relationship with each other until they
[56:44] come to the altar because it's unclean
[56:47] living
[56:48] best in life
[56:50] the best one right because that was what
[56:53] it would be unclean because they haven't
[56:55] fulfilled the rest of their vows their
[56:58] situations and the people in the church
[57:00] are sitting waiting and saying hey how
[57:02] come these here too you know they've
[57:03] been engaged for two years and got three
[57:05] kids
[57:06] well they're engaged the same as bad now
[57:08] that don't come up to me with that now
[57:09] I'll say you know I don't agree with it
[57:11] right right
[57:12] now that could be what had happened out
[57:14] of it if you just went ahead and started
[57:15] living together
[57:17] right
[57:18] you'd wind up with being
[57:21] kids born before you fulfill the rest of
[57:24] your vows and we don't agree with that
[57:25] part
[57:28] because it would be uncleanly
[57:33] it would be fornication that's the
[57:35] fornication we're talking about you say
[57:37] well why the why is the fact that you're
[57:39] not supposed to do it
[57:42] there's no other reason than why
[57:45] the law only gives you a right to go
[57:47] down and live together as husband and
[57:49] wife and right off you tax the bracket
[57:51] it ain't got nothing to do with us being
[57:53] married
[57:54] yeah
[57:56] but if you if it wound up she could wind
[57:58] up with a baby born before they ever had
[58:00] their problems with the older that would
[58:02] be fornication that'd be unclean living
[58:06] right and that's why Paul says this is
[58:09] unseemingly to his virgin his virgin
[58:12] because his girl and boy both have
[58:14] urgency man had Divergence as well
[58:16] and that that would be you know
[58:20] there wouldn't be anything to just go
[58:21] out and live together
[58:26] I mean maybe I'm old-fashioned but
[58:27] that's the way I look at it
[58:29] that you're not supposed to do that
[58:33] and I think that you ought to straighten
[58:35] that up between yourself
[58:38] now if somebody done that then you go
[58:40] straight up to yourself and say I'm
[58:42] sorry
[58:43] we should have waited
[58:46] all right
[58:49] let's see then that would be the point
[58:50] of sale
[58:51] well we did do wrong
[58:56] because you understand what I'm saying
[58:57] I'm trying to answer the question but
[58:59] answer it in a sensible form
[59:01] that you can wind up with a baby out of
[59:02] just being engaged
[59:04] and I'm sure it wouldn't look good
[59:09] so that would be against Christianity
[59:12] as far as saying a quote out of the
[59:14] scripture you can't come up with
[59:16] whatever I think I may have found a
[59:20] scripture that might help all right
[59:22] First Corinthians 6
[59:25] First Corinthians 6 verse 12.
[59:29] all things are life belong to me but all
[59:31] things are not expedient right all
[59:33] things are lawful for me but I will not
[59:35] be brought under the power of any right
[59:39] exactly
[59:42] so because you
[59:45] let's see let me look through here
[59:47] because I got it
[59:49] um
[59:51] oh lonely Grace I got something written
[59:54] down that's flicking in my mind
[1:00:01] 7 36.
[1:00:05] right yeah
[1:00:13] but if a man thanked him that he had
[1:00:15] behaved himself on
[1:00:17] commonly toward his virgin
[1:00:20] if she passed the fire of her age
[1:00:23] and need no requirement this has got to
[1:00:25] go back something else I'll explain this
[1:00:26] uh everyone said don't live I'm looking
[1:00:30] it's written on pages of my Bible
[1:00:32] said don't live dirty
[1:00:35] that's the way he said yeah
[1:00:38] because he's saying here see if she
[1:00:40] passed the floor of her age you need so
[1:00:41] require let him do what he will he
[1:00:44] sineth not let him marry that's not
[1:00:46] that's that's talking of of the man's
[1:00:49] virginity and and literally in plain
[1:00:51] language it's saying that if it passed
[1:00:54] the point of him being able to have a
[1:00:58] relationship
[1:01:01] then they could still get married and
[1:01:03] not understand it
[1:01:04] I mean that's what that's going on into
[1:01:06] I'm sorry it's just you know pass the
[1:01:09] flower but what I said the man's got a
[1:01:11] virginity as well as the woman's got a
[1:01:12] virginity
[1:01:13] right and we just hop on to the woman
[1:01:15] you know and don't say nothing about the
[1:01:17] man
[1:01:18] well
[1:01:19] we better get down on both of them I'm
[1:01:22] still trying to find that we'll run
[1:01:23] around and said don't live dirty
[1:01:29] I'll find it and bring it back okay
[1:01:31] where he just says don't live dirty oh
[1:01:34] that would be dirty to go on and go
[1:01:36] ahead and live together
[1:01:38] before you go on down to the thing
[1:01:40] because that would you would be sure you
[1:01:42] say well we're married
[1:01:45] well you can't convince the judge that
[1:01:48] and you certainly wouldn't want to try
[1:01:50] to convince the denominations about that
[1:01:53] it's a woman and man gets engaged they
[1:01:55] can just go ahead and live together you
[1:01:56] try that out there with the
[1:01:57] denominations they tell you wrong
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:01] we deal in a lot of other rents was that
[1:02:04] clear what you're talking about
[1:02:07] brother Al
[1:02:08] so further thought on that to me
[1:02:12] you've got to come to the ceremony
[1:02:15] to be joined together as one in God
[1:02:18] and nothing should happen until that is
[1:02:21] second place because you're finishing
[1:02:23] the way right you got stairs you're
[1:02:27] engaged you've got no vials and then you
[1:02:30] got the
[1:02:31] honeymoon as last name of justification
[1:02:34] and sanctification but not yet got the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost
[1:02:39] so that would be the point somebody else
[1:02:44] okay
[1:02:49] I'm gonna write any comments any
[1:02:50] thoughts it seems complex gonna do if
[1:02:53] that'll work no we're not going to get
[1:02:54] into the sermon I'll do it Sunday so uh
[1:02:57] Joe and them don't even have to type up
[1:02:59] their notes because I had him to lay
[1:03:01] these aside
[1:03:03] and I've got them holding here it's
[1:03:05] worth it there's something that I want
[1:03:07] to speak to you about
[1:03:08] and I ask you I don't know how many
[1:03:11] times
[1:03:12] I've asked you to please read invisible
[1:03:16] you
[1:03:18] now please before Sunday right
[1:03:21] read invisible beginning man
[1:03:27] I mean today I just had just a little
[1:03:28] town I just went and sat down just
[1:03:30] looking through it I keep it in my
[1:03:32] possession laying on my desk
[1:03:34] read an invisible Union
[1:03:38] it might be surprises spread around
[1:03:41] himself
[1:03:46] you might find out why he say it a
[1:03:49] supernatural Revelation because of the
[1:03:52] opening
[1:03:53] of the Seven Seals
[1:03:58] that's on marriage and divorce
[1:04:01] right read invisible Union I ask you to
[1:04:05] to a word that you can be with me when I
[1:04:07] start going through it
[1:04:09] to express something
[1:04:12] about this on marriage and divorce
[1:04:15] that I've seen for I don't really know
[1:04:17] how many years back that the Lord spoke
[1:04:19] to me about it or started talking to but
[1:04:21] now it's coming out to work and
[1:04:23] explained
[1:04:24] amen you know in wordings that can be
[1:04:26] expressed because I always wondered why
[1:04:29] this ties with this
[1:04:30] foreign
[1:04:34] so then brother brother boy
[1:04:36] so this you have the free line
[1:04:39] oh
[1:04:42] what if you go through counseling
[1:04:46] and the pastor uh he just comes flat out
[1:04:50] and tells you
[1:04:51] you divorce
[1:04:54] not for any uh
[1:04:57] anything that's done outside them
[1:05:00] the relationship but you were trying to
[1:05:02] save a marriage and you went counseling
[1:05:05] and counseling and counseling and he
[1:05:07] just finally comes up says you need to
[1:05:09] get out of there
[1:05:15] if the pastor just tells you that you
[1:05:18] need to get a divorce
[1:05:19] and it's not on scriptural grounds
[1:05:24] would it be scriptural ground in other
[1:05:26] words would it be an adulterous Affair
[1:05:28] or a fornication involved
[1:05:30] this is
[1:05:32] my situation this is what happened years
[1:05:35] ago yeah okay
[1:05:37] and I tried to save and save and he said
[1:05:39] you need the divorce there you are
[1:05:44] now ignorance of the word of
[1:05:47] on my part
[1:05:50] is the problem right I understand I
[1:05:53] understand
[1:05:55] but I often think
[1:05:58] you're counseling somebody how can you
[1:06:00] ever save it
[1:06:02] the thing about it is what's he going to
[1:06:04] have on his shoulders a judgment that's
[1:06:06] it see misinterpreted theology is what
[1:06:09] around said the reason we're in this
[1:06:11] marital situation you go to church where
[1:06:13] somebody okay is for these things they
[1:06:16] just marry and remarry and divorce and
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:19] and that you go to the Catholic and
[1:06:21] there's no worse there but they just
[1:06:23] sprinkle salt on you turn you around and
[1:06:25] they actually speak your virginity back
[1:06:27] that's actually the doings with the
[1:06:29] brother in this message he spoke to
[1:06:31] virginity he said back into his sister
[1:06:33] you know what I I immediately knew that
[1:06:35] something wrong sort of run and grabbed
[1:06:37] the message started searching I found it
[1:06:39] but around said that's Catholic Church
[1:06:41] that does that
[1:06:43] see it's not not the doings but it's you
[1:06:46] know
[1:06:47] got a delivery
[1:06:49] thank you
[1:06:50] now let's see what it
[1:06:56] oh okay so he found all right this is on
[1:06:59] the mesh on questions and answers in 64.
[1:07:04] the morning service paragraph 304 is
[1:07:07] basically what it is
[1:07:12] talking about what this pertains is but
[1:07:14] if you cannot contain
[1:07:16] let them marry for it's better to marry
[1:07:19] than to burn all right that's for just
[1:07:22] dirty living
[1:07:24] watch it
[1:07:26] instead of a boy a man a boy and girl or
[1:07:30] something another when they're going
[1:07:32] together and and they know that they
[1:07:35] should be married go ahead and get
[1:07:36] married
[1:07:38] thank you you understand what I mean
[1:07:40] don't you see don't just live with dirty
[1:07:44] little life there because it's not right
[1:07:46] you see that's your sister in one sense
[1:07:49] where if you're a Christian now if it's
[1:07:52] the world
[1:07:54] it's the world dog eat dog but this girl
[1:07:57] that you're going with that's your
[1:07:59] sister too that will be the mother of
[1:08:02] your your children that will come don't

[1:08:07] show that you're a real Christian
[1:08:08] gentleman live like a Christian
[1:08:10] gentleman ought to and treat her like
[1:08:13] your sister when you get married still
[1:08:16] treat her that way
[1:08:17] foreign
[1:08:35] the Bible said not let one dirty
[1:08:38] conversation come among you when your
[1:08:40] professional colonist treat that little
[1:08:42] lady like she's your little sweetheart

[1:08:49] same you be that Gallant boyfriend

[1:08:55] these new things and I know what I'm
[1:08:58] talking and you just be a husband a
[1:09:01] genuine brother a genuine Christian I
[1:09:03] know that sounds but you're my kids I
[1:09:06] got a right to say what I want to you
[1:09:07] you see you're my kids you liberal and

[1:09:26] family relationships and so forth like
[1:09:28] that let it be just irreverently and
[1:09:30] godly and agree with among you and
[1:09:32] everything as it could be don't never
[1:09:34] push and shove and be dirty invoker I
[1:09:36] knew that was Richmond was the part that
[1:09:39] I was doing come running around and said
[1:09:40] don't live dirty
[1:09:41] so that would be fornication would be
[1:09:43] unclean leaving just because you get
[1:09:46] engaged and then you say well we can
[1:09:49] just go ahead and live together that's
[1:09:50] unclean living
[1:09:52] right that would that shouldn't be done
[1:09:54] that would be you know going
[1:09:56] your brother Brown said go get married
[1:09:59] so it's better to marry it is to burn
[1:10:02] now that don't justify somebody else
[1:10:05] that says it's better to marry
[1:10:07] than to burn that don't give a guy right
[1:10:10] it's married two or three times to say
[1:10:12] well it's better for me to go get
[1:10:13] married it is to burn
[1:10:15] you ought to do some praying about
[1:10:16] burning
[1:10:19] that's just plain
[1:10:21] but they ought to be praying for that
[1:10:23] you you say well that's too hard to pray
[1:10:25] about that brother well I'm
[1:10:27] a brother Ashley one time a question
[1:10:30] answered as honest I could he said Can a
[1:10:32] homosexual be saved
[1:10:34] I'm sure but he won't remain homosexual
[1:10:39] that's right you won't do that again can
[1:10:42] a prostitute be saved yes but they won't
[1:10:45] go living in their prostitution you want
[1:10:46] scripture for that one now for sure and
[1:10:48] Jesus still said go
[1:10:51] and sin no more
[1:10:54] unless the worser thing he said come
[1:10:56] upon you
[1:10:59] all right to anybody else
[1:11:01] thank you brother thank you
[1:11:06] anybody else any comments questions
[1:11:08] thoughts
[1:11:12] your childhood you're scratching your
[1:11:13] head or you want that stuff
[1:11:19] we do this like you're saying it to sale
[1:11:20] just don't never raise your hand at a
[1:11:22] sale you might buy some
[1:11:25] so just keep both hands down
[1:11:29] but just joking anybody got any comments
[1:11:31] any college
[1:11:35] I just asked you to please Rick you got
[1:11:37] something yeah you thought that uh but
[1:11:40] if I got married
[1:11:44] the one now
[1:11:45] um
[1:11:49] being married by the justices of peace
[1:11:52] is not right
[1:11:54] as Christians it shouldn't be done but
[1:11:57] if the law is legal
[1:12:00] and if you're not Christian and marrying
[1:12:03] and the gesture of the peace does it
[1:12:04] then it is all right because it's a
[1:12:08] legality of the state law that the
[1:12:10] Justice these have the right to do your
[1:12:12] wedding the judge has the things but uh
[1:12:16] brother Brown and explaining it said you
[1:12:18] ought to get married in a church
[1:12:20] that was way explained so if you ought
[1:12:22] to get married in a church all right
[1:12:25] but he said now they're regardless you
[1:12:28] are married
[1:12:29] the the judge of the peace done the
[1:12:31] wedding you're married
[1:12:34] okay
[1:12:40] all right anybody else
[1:12:56] we need to realize that uh
[1:12:59] all the things was done in the past of
[1:13:01] course it's in the past
[1:13:03] and the way we look at things now what
[1:13:06] we're doing is we're trying to clean up
[1:13:08] a mess right try to clean up a mask from
[1:13:11] all of us made and because of
[1:13:14] misinterpreted theology Even in our own
[1:13:16] mind you didn't have to be a church
[1:13:18] member but your own misinterpretation
[1:13:22] that's why this that's why this marriage
[1:13:24] and divorce situation is so serious
[1:13:27] because it is here to clean up somebody
[1:13:30] that wants to be a real true Christian
[1:13:34] and it's here it's here to clean us up
[1:13:36] and this is the guideline that we we go
[1:13:39] by now we've made errors in the past
[1:13:41] maybe but like brother Burns it he said
[1:13:44] he said go on as you are but you know
[1:13:47] God help you if you do it again right
[1:13:49] well that's what we got to do we gotta
[1:13:51] we got to take here and realize that
[1:13:53] once we become Christians we don't even
[1:13:56] participate in the things of the world
[1:13:58] we should never even have the mindset of
[1:14:02] what the normal world is because the
[1:14:04] normal world you can divorce in 15 you
[1:14:07] know 15 minutes or 15 hours whatever it
[1:14:09] is the minimum time you and they don't
[1:14:10] care anymore
[1:14:12] it's like we were talking today people
[1:14:16] just don't care anymore they married and
[1:14:17] divorced yeah do this live together have
[1:14:19] kids it doesn't bother them to have kids
[1:14:21] you know
[1:14:23] and uh this is for Christians only right
[1:14:27] right this is for and I'm talking about
[1:14:28] born-again Christian this is for
[1:14:31] born-again Christians only but how to
[1:14:34] get our life straightened out that's why
[1:14:37] marriage and divorce should never be
[1:14:38] discussed with anybody that's not a
[1:14:40] born-again Christian right because it
[1:14:43] will do them no good
[1:14:44] until they see the Saving Grace of Jesus
[1:14:47] Christ first for their own soul clean
[1:14:50] the soul up first
[1:14:52] the the
[1:14:54] word's been here for two thousand years
[1:14:56] to clean the soul up but in the end time
[1:14:59] God's trying to get a people to realize
[1:15:02] that we can get clean
[1:15:04] not only on the inside but on the
[1:15:07] outside right now
[1:15:08] that's that's been almost an
[1:15:11] impossibility like like Paul said he
[1:15:13] sees through a glass Darkly well well he
[1:15:16] saw something he was trying to attain to
[1:15:17] but he couldn't get there because he
[1:15:19] didn't have enough word opened up to
[1:15:22] allow him to get to that exactly it
[1:15:24] wasn't that the word was not there the
[1:15:25] word's been there since the foundation
[1:15:27] of the world but man's theology has
[1:15:29] closed everybody's mind
[1:15:31] made everybody misinterpret what God
[1:15:34] said it wasn't so from the beginning but
[1:15:37] what we got to realize is that that it's
[1:15:39] good to have this it's good to have
[1:15:41] questions but realize one thing this is
[1:15:43] for you and I only right this is for us
[1:15:48] if you're born again and you go on As
[1:15:51] You Are
[1:15:52] God forbid if you do it again now God's
[1:15:55] made a way for you to clean yourself up
[1:15:57] and there's no way you can do it but
[1:16:00] you've allowed God to take over
[1:16:03] and not just say well well God now I'm
[1:16:06] cleaning the soul but not now God you
[1:16:07] can clean me up in the body right
[1:16:10] because that's what we're dealing with
[1:16:11] we're dealing with with with clean
[1:16:13] living
[1:16:15] if we're not living clean right now then
[1:16:17] then you're not born again you just just
[1:16:21] start at that point and say God I'm not
[1:16:24] I'm not where I should be if if I'm you
[1:16:28] know God forbid if somebody's sitting in
[1:16:29] this building is committing adultery
[1:16:32] uh you know somebody come in two days
[1:16:35] ago maybe but
[1:16:37] we've been sitting here more than two
[1:16:39] weeks we ought to realize what's been
[1:16:41] preached from the pulpit right
[1:16:44] ought to convict you if you're if you're
[1:16:45] truly a Christian
[1:16:47] and and I know a lot of us all sitting
[1:16:50] here we needed the grace of marriage and
[1:16:52] divorce and the Grace has been given and
[1:16:55] we've taken that Grace but let's don't
[1:16:57] make it this great right let's let's
[1:16:59] let's take it as something that that God
[1:17:02] has given us
[1:17:03] and give no one else on the face of the
[1:17:05] Earth
[1:17:06] is that right he's not giving this to
[1:17:08] anybody since the dawn of time
[1:17:12] Even Adam and Eve messed it up but he's
[1:17:16] given us an opportunity right here in
[1:17:18] the end time to clean this thing up
[1:17:20] right yeah sure we all got a problem but
[1:17:23] God's gave us a way to get out of it all
[1:17:25] right to take care of us
[1:17:28] if not We're not gonna have a body chain
[1:17:29] right it's not body change won't come if
[1:17:33] we keep all this in the misintercept
[1:17:35] theology is still working today
[1:17:38] you want to just misinterpret the
[1:17:39] Theology of marriage and divorce I don't
[1:17:42] know it's misinterpret Theology of
[1:17:43] everything all the documents in the
[1:17:46] message and all the mess ups uh you know
[1:17:48] like I said like you said a false
[1:17:50] Doctrine is not going to take a body
[1:17:51] change no
[1:17:52] no can't do it why because it has not
[1:17:55] seen the grace that's right that God's
[1:17:57] give us through the brother Brown was
[1:17:59] ministering through the preaching of the
[1:18:00] final four Ministries for the you didn't
[1:18:02] say for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:18:04] soul
[1:18:09] so he's going to perfect this body
[1:18:12] spirit and soul somewhere somewhere down
[1:18:14] the line
[1:18:15] we're going to see that God's done this
[1:18:17] for us right and then that's when we can
[1:18:19] really uh you know you don't get the big
[1:18:22] head you really think so so less of
[1:18:25] yourself you're so humbled that
[1:18:27] that uh the guy show this to me and then
[1:18:31] we we embraced the grace and then we
[1:18:34] extend the grace
[1:18:36] but we need to realize that what's past
[1:18:38] is past what's done is done right
[1:18:41] and let's move on like Paul said to the
[1:18:43] mark of the high call right our higher
[1:18:45] calling was is higher than Paul's right
[1:18:47] our higher our higher calling is sitting
[1:18:50] in this
[1:18:51] seed in a Pew in a message Church
[1:18:54] believing what the preachers are saying
[1:18:55] and doing what the what the uh what the
[1:18:58] word of God says well the marriage and
[1:19:00] divorce like you said marriage and
[1:19:01] divorce not something brother Brown
[1:19:02] pulled out of the sky and that's all
[1:19:04] through the Bible exactly all through
[1:19:06] the Bible it's laying right there for us
[1:19:08] to to see and then when Jesus was
[1:19:10] confronted he exactly took him right
[1:19:12] back and said hey it wasn't so from the
[1:19:13] beginning
[1:19:14] but because
[1:19:16] of the hardness of your heart unless
[1:19:18] he's talking to us he wasn't talking to
[1:19:20] the Pharisees that day he's talking
[1:19:21] about Pharisees that within us exactly
[1:19:23] because the hardness of your heart
[1:19:25] Moses Paul brother Brown gave us exactly
[1:19:29] her brother Brown was writing a
[1:19:30] divorcement
[1:19:31] is going to take us to a body chain the
[1:19:34] writing of divorcement they give Moses
[1:19:37] and Paul was a written piece of paper
[1:19:39] you understand what I'm saying it was a
[1:19:41] written piece of paper and you handed it
[1:19:42] to your wife well that's sure that's
[1:19:44] natural we talk about it in the end time
[1:19:46] but spiritually
[1:19:48] it's got to be dated right
[1:19:51] and the Man Came
[1:19:52] beavers I mean the woman can't be
[1:19:53] divorced horse
[1:19:54] gotta be dated that's what we got to
[1:19:56] work on on the spiritual part right
[1:19:59] right I just want everybody to realize
[1:20:00] that this is a great thing it's a great
[1:20:03] this is not preached many places you
[1:20:05] know why because the preachers scared
[1:20:06] the preacher because the people leave
[1:20:07] the lead I throw him out yeah one of the
[1:20:10] two
[1:20:11] because it still is misinterpreted
[1:20:14] theology in the message but thank God
[1:20:15] we've we've had truth preached and the
[1:20:18] word of God preached here and other
