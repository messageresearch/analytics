[0:01] let's start up with the
[0:02] call and greetings to all of you that
[0:06] came in
[0:09] late now today's topic is a continuation
[0:13] from the last one which
[0:17] was
[0:19] communion
[0:21] communion
[0:28] testing be
[0:34] better trying to get it at just the
[0:36] right
[0:37] spot
[0:39] okay so let's turn to Ephesians chap 2
[0:44] verse
[0:49] 13 and you notice even in
[0:54] Galatians all through the
[0:56] scripture this theme of the stature of
[0:58] perfect man is repeated
[1:01] you're you're growing God's bringing you
[1:03] from crying out the father to he's grow
[1:06] bringing you from crying out as a baby
[1:08] into uh closer and closer walk with God
[1:12] and and um
[1:15] so me and brother Wade are going to
[1:17] cross lines a little bit and
[1:21] um so let's let's read from Ephesians 2
[1:24] verse
[1:26] 13 and talk about
[1:28] communion
[1:31] chapter
[1:36] two but now in Christ
[1:39] Jesus you who sometimes were far off are
[1:44] made nigh by the blood of
[1:46] Christ for he is our peace who hath made
[1:50] both
[1:51] one and hath broken down the middle wall
[1:54] partition between
[1:55] us having abolished in his flesh the
[1:59] enmity
[2:00] even the law of Commandments contained
[2:02] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[2:06] Twain one new man so making
[2:09] peace and that he might reconcile both
[2:12] unto God in one body by the cross having
[2:16] slain the enmity
[2:19] thereby now there's communion let's
[2:22] let's let's go to the Lord in prayer
[2:23] real quick because he always want to
[2:24] pray um you know prayer is part of the
[2:27] the community communion act with between
[2:29] man and god let's Lord Jesus we just
[2:32] thank you God for your grace to us today
[2:34] Lord thank you for giving us traveling
[2:37] mercies yesterday and we all went to the
[2:38] fellowship meeting Lord and I pray God
[2:40] that you'll just be with brother way
[2:41] this morning as Minister us today Lord
[2:43] and open our hearts to hear your word
[2:45] and to see more of who you are and who
[2:47] we are Grant it Lord bless the sick and
[2:50] Afflicted and and be with the ones that
[2:52] couldn't be here today we pray in your
[2:54] name
[2:56] amen
[2:58] so
[3:01] I I hope you kind of are getting a
[3:02] picture of what God is doing is is he
[3:05] bringing us the the whole the stature of
[3:07] perfect man is really the central point
[3:09] of of
[3:12] uh it just Blends together all of these
[3:15] different doctrines Genesis
[3:18] 12627 one man made up of many many
[3:21] people he we got the statute of perf man
[3:24] down through the seven Church ages God
[3:26] is building up a body where he can come
[3:29] and dwell in fullness and that body is
[3:32] made up of lots of different people so
[3:34] he's bringing that Heavenly pattern like
[3:37] we talked about and and uh Moses went up
[3:39] the mountain and he saw uh God showed
[3:42] him the Heavenly pattern of how he
[3:43] should build a tabernacle so God's
[3:46] taking that Heavenly pattern and
[3:48] bringing it down to earth and how is he
[3:50] bringing it down to earth he's he's
[3:51] doing it through through through
[3:53] different stages of justification
[3:56] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[3:58] Ghost where at Faith then you can be
[4:01] begin taking the Lord's Supper because
[4:03] you're you're in communion with God but
[4:06] yet you're not in full communion and
[4:09] that's what uh brother Wade's going to
[4:11] get to when he starts talking about
[4:13] adoption is he's bringing us into closer
[4:16] and closer until we're in total
[4:18] agreement and that's the plan now now
[4:22] what I'm kind of getting to maybe I'm
[4:24] cheating a little bit you know somebody
[4:25] was telling me they called Microsoft
[4:27] support and when they got on the phone
[4:28] with Microsoft at at work they they said
[4:31] now this is what we're going to do and
[4:33] then they told them everything that they
[4:34] were going to do so I'm kind of telling
[4:36] you this is what we're going to do and
[4:38] then we'll get into the details because
[4:41] you we kind of get in our head that
[4:43] justification is something that just
[4:45] happens once it's like a one shot thing
[4:48] you get one shot to get your sins
[4:49] chopped off but justification you know
[4:52] brother Dale's been teaching that
[4:53] there's a mysterious part of
[4:54] justification a mysterious part of
[4:56] sanctification after you get the Holy
[4:58] Ghost there's still justification but
[5:02] you know if you if you do something
[5:03] wrong go to the Lord and get down on
[5:05] your knees like uh uh somebody was
[5:07] mentioning in one of the Sunday School
[5:08] classes that that that God saw that
[5:11] David had the right kind of attitude
[5:14] he's a man after God heart because when
[5:16] he did something wrong he ran quickly to
[5:19] the Lord God forgive me of what I've
[5:22] done even after you get the new birth if
[5:25] you do something wrong then quickly run
[5:27] to the Lord and he'll chop off your SE
[5:30] it's the Holy Ghost uh the Holy Ghost
[5:33] doing a work in you even after you've
[5:36] got the new birth to bring you into
[5:38] perfect communion with God and then what
[5:41] happens now this is the this is kind of
[5:44] this quote that brother Brown said back
[5:46] in 1959 kind of sums
[5:49] up where we're going it's just amazing
[5:52] that the things that brother brandham
[5:54] brought out in detail later on his
[5:56] ministry were also preached early on in
[5:59] his ministry they you go back and see
[6:03] the seals the stature for perfect man
[6:06] the uh all these things and I maybe he
[6:08] didn't even realize what he was saying
[6:10] because he said you know he'll get up
[6:12] and and the one time he said I I was
[6:14] preaching and my I just left my body and
[6:18] I was watching myself preach the Lord
[6:21] just completely took him over and began
[6:23] to speaking maybe he didn't even know
[6:24] what he was
[6:25] saying what was the Holy Ghost given for
[6:28] 1959 he said
[6:30] God poured himself into Christ correct
[6:33] Christ poured himself into the church
[6:36] therefore now watch and that day you
[6:39] will know that I am in the father and
[6:41] you are in me and I am in
[6:45] you and that day you'll know it right
[6:48] for the whole thing is one Plan of
[6:51] Redemption coming down that God coming
[6:54] back to live in and dwell with and
[6:58] commune to his people as he did at the
[7:01] beginning now look look now he's talking
[7:03] about coming down and we know that the
[7:06] Rapture when brother preached the
[7:07] Rapture message it was contrary to what
[7:09] we thought we thought the Rapture would
[7:12] be us going up which it is you know but
[7:15] what is it really it's God coming down
[7:18] right by the word to make us to to build
[7:22] us up into an image well let's I'll let
[7:25] brother say it now then as soon as he
[7:28] gets his church in speaking
[7:32] conditions
[7:33] wait I think I no I didn't skip over now
[7:37] then as soon as he gets his church in
[7:38] speaking conditions and gets his church
[7:40] to a place that he can flow himself
[7:42] through and love and persuade and
[7:47] fellowship then there will come an Eden
[7:50] he'll take his church back to where it
[7:52] left him at back to an Eden again that
[7:55] there where it fell and now that's where
[7:58] it made it it first start of fall
[8:01] there's where it'll be taken right back
[8:03] with every clean state of redemption now
[8:06] how can you be in speeding condition if
[8:09] you don't fully uh have a full
[8:11] revelation of God's plan of who you are
[8:14] of who he is of what God's doing because
[8:17] brother Brown said I don't have that
[8:19] quote right now but the the the bride
[8:20] will know his will and his will this is
[8:24] his will his will is for you to have
[8:26] perfect communion with him to have
[8:29] not just uh you know it started off in
[8:32] in the Ephesus age the the on the day of
[8:34] Pentecost and and they they uh you know
[8:38] they the church began to grow but now in
[8:41] this day something special has to happen
[8:45] had to happen for us to take a body
[8:48] change and that's what happened when the
[8:50] seals were open and from 1963 on the the
[8:53] word began to preach in a way that could
[8:56] that could bring us back into full
[8:58] communion to Total uh to join us
[9:01] together in perfect Oneness of unity
[9:03] with Christ so that's that's kind of the
[9:06] plan what I'm what I'm talking
[9:08] about now 2 Corinthians I'm just kind of
[9:11] read some scriptures 2 Corinthians
[9:14] chapter 5:18 and 19 all things are of
[9:16] God who ha reconciled us to himself by
[9:19] Jesus Christ and hath given to us the
[9:22] ministry of reconciliation to wit that
[9:25] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[9:28] unto himself
[9:29] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[9:32] and haveth committed unto us the word of
[9:35] Recon reconciliation CU that's what what
[9:38] communion is is Recon reconciling
[9:42] reconciliation is I just print out the
[9:44] definition is to restore friendly
[9:46] relations between it's to cause to
[9:49] coexist in a Harmony or make or show to
[9:53] be
[9:54] compatible it's uh you know if you at
[9:57] work we do Financial things and and if
[10:00] if if you got some numbers missing or
[10:03] something out of place you got to
[10:04] reconcile it you go got to go back to
[10:06] the source and figure out where what's
[10:08] missing now that's what God's doing if
[10:11] there's anything that's not exactly
[10:13] right in your life and and brother
[10:15] brother Dale brother wa has has you know
[10:18] as we's talking about the statute of
[10:19] perfect man he's going through how the
[10:21] Holy Spirit washes you out and cleanses
[10:24] you and gets all the things all the
[10:27] little Trash that's not exactly right
[10:29] out to bring you into perfect
[10:32] reconciliation now you can see how when
[10:34] you when you get the baptism of the Holy
[10:36] Ghost you can take communion cuz you're
[10:38] now the Lord can teach you the holy
[10:41] spirit is is dwelling inside of you and
[10:43] he's your teacher and can instruct you
[10:45] and and show you how to walk but now
[10:48] he's bringing us that that's what the
[10:51] seals the the that Capstone had to do to
[10:54] bring us back into perfect perfect
[10:56] communion with him so that we can take a
[10:59] body change and communion is always
[11:03] the communion has always been the kind
[11:06] of the problem what what what kind of
[11:09] got me thinking about this topic was we
[11:11] were at a fellowship meeting many months
[11:13] ago and we were standing outside and uh
[11:15] with all brothers and this as this
[11:17] brother walked up and uh one of the
[11:19] brothers said uh do you know he telling
[11:22] to talking to other brother do you know
[11:23] that brother he said well I know him but
[11:27] you know I don't really know him
[11:30] and and I wonder sometimes if that's how
[11:32] we are with Jesus Christ we we have
[11:35] heard about it maybe we we've uh we know
[11:39] we know him but do you know him and
[11:43] that's the whole basis of the Christian
[11:46] experience if you if you try to approach
[11:48] Christianity without communion then
[11:51] you're doing it based on the wrong
[11:53] motive the wrong objective because the
[11:55] whole purpose of communion is to know
[11:57] Jesus Christ and and you know we know by
[11:59] the scripture that the only way to know
[12:02] Jesus Christ to know God is by his word
[12:06] but it starts with communion it's start
[12:09] remember brother brother brandom telling
[12:10] that story of how he first wanted to
[12:12] know God and he he a letter to God and
[12:16] he put it out of the woods and he said I
[12:18] know you walk by here I want to talk to
[12:21] you I might be paraphrasing that wrong
[12:24] but but the that's how my journey
[12:27] started is I I I I didn't want to know I
[12:30] didn't want to just knowledge I didn't
[12:32] want to just know about him but I wanted
[12:35] to know
[12:36] him and that's the whole point of the
[12:39] Christian Journey the whole Christian
[12:40] experience if if you find yourself maybe
[12:42] getting off a little off track and maybe
[12:47] um cuz God wants to know you too if you
[12:51] he he's your pear of great price and
[12:53] your his it works both ways see he wants
[12:57] to and and uh you you know part of the
[12:59] journey is that God is unfolding his
[13:02] will to you and the first step in
[13:05] justification one of the things that I
[13:07] believe God reveals in justification is
[13:09] that he wants to save you now let's
[13:13] maybe look at uh a little example let's
[13:17] turn to John 12 and we're going to go to
[13:21] John and then Matthew and then Mark and
[13:23] then back to
[13:27] John
[13:39] now we were just reading in Galatians
[13:41] about the Bond woman and the free and
[13:43] how this that theme is is repeated all
[13:45] through scriptures there's two lines
[13:46] there's one that's got the promise and
[13:49] one that's Bound by their own their
[13:51] trees and trees and traditions and and
[13:53] their own ideas and everything and and
[13:56] and and here we're going to read a
[13:57] little story that if you kind of read
[13:59] between the lines you're looking at
[14:01] somebody that wanted communion somebody
[14:04] that wanted to know God and somebody
[14:06] that just wanted a name for themselves
[14:08] that wanted to set up a little personal
[14:09] Kingdom that wanted to to to make thems
[14:12] look great now now there's the problem
[14:14] because communion is just between you
[14:16] and God if you try to put if you try to
[14:19] uh it's about you know ministering
[14:22] really if if a minister I you know I
[14:25] haven't been ministering that long but
[14:26] this is you know I believe that if a
[14:28] minister gets into the way if somebody
[14:29] else is communion then then you're
[14:31] getting close to nickan ISM the
[14:33] ministers are to introduce somebody to
[14:36] Christ there's God if you get in the way
[14:39] then that that messes up the the the
[14:42] plan of communion right now John
[14:49] 12 tells this little story of the suffer
[14:52] of
[14:53] Bethany when Mary came and washed
[14:55] Jesus's feet let's just read through it
[14:57] real quick let's start at verse one then
[14:59] Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to
[15:01] Bethany where Lazarus was which had been
[15:04] dead whom he whom he raised from the
[15:06] dead there they made him a supper and
[15:08] Martha served but Lazarus was one of
[15:09] them that ate at the table with him that
[15:12] sat at the table with him then Mary took
[15:14] and took Mary a pound of ointment of
[15:16] spiter very costly and anointed the feet
[15:18] of Jesus and wiped his feet with her
[15:20] hair and the house was filled with the
[15:21] odor of the ointment then saith one of
[15:23] his disciples Judas is scariot Simon's
[15:25] son which should betray him why was not
[15:28] this ointment sold for 300 p and given
[15:30] to the poor now we know this story
[15:32] brother B told it in in such a dramatic
[15:34] way about Jesus with dirty feet and all
[15:36] is about how this little woman was
[15:38] afraid that Jesus wouldn't accept her
[15:40] and she was looking she was ready to
[15:42] give everything away to Jesus because
[15:44] she wanted she didn't she wasn't maybe
[15:46] so interested in knowing uh at that time
[15:49] all the technical details but she wanted
[15:51] a relationship with God that's what the
[15:54] whole Christian experience is based on
[15:55] is a relationship with God she wanted
[15:58] communion with him now Jes Judas on the
[16:00] other hand was looking for a flaw and I
[16:03] I've read I I spent some time reading a
[16:06] lot of quotes about Judas and and and
[16:09] the thing that brother BR pointed out
[16:10] about Judas was he was he was kind of
[16:12] alone looking for looking to find fault
[16:16] looking to find something where he could
[16:18] say there it is there is the problem and
[16:21] this is what this was the turning point
[16:23] I believe in Jesus's life when he he
[16:27] came along through justification and
[16:28] sanctification and here comes this
[16:30] little woman that's willing to give up
[16:31] everything and Judas has a problem with
[16:34] her spending a lot of money on the the
[16:37] the O and watch what he does then saith
[16:41] one of his disciples you his car Simon
[16:43] son which should betray him why was not
[16:44] this ointment sold for 300 p and given
[16:47] to the
[16:48] poor he was he was after money he was
[16:51] after he was more wanting to make
[16:53] himself look like a good Christian a
[16:55] good
[16:57] person look look how concerned I am for
[17:00] the poor look how look look what great
[17:02] things I'm doing this he said now
[17:05] there's the explanation not that he
[17:06] cared for the poor but because he was a
[17:08] thief and had the bag and bu what was
[17:10] put therein then Jesus said let her
[17:12] alone against the day of my buring has
[17:14] she kept this for the poor always ye
[17:16] have with with me with you but me have
[17:19] not
[17:20] always
[17:23] now the word when the word is presented
[17:26] it always separates sure you don't have
[17:28] to be mean and nasty to get somebody to
[17:30] to you know to separate the word you
[17:34] know Jesus Jesus would mean he just told
[17:37] him like it was you don't you're not
[17:38] always going to have me what she did was
[17:41] right and correct and this was judas's
[17:45] right after this we'll read in in
[17:47] Matthew and Mark now look look in John
[17:50] what it says much people of the Jews
[17:51] therefore knew that he was there and
[17:53] they
[17:55] came let's see let's skip down to verse
[17:58] 10 10 but the chief priests consulted
[18:00] that they might put Lazarus alter also
[18:02] to death because that by reason of him
[18:04] many of the Jews went away and believed
[18:06] on Jesus now they're looking to kill
[18:08] people they're looking they're looking
[18:10] to to to kill Lazarus and Jesus and all
[18:15] they needed was somebody to help out
[18:17] somebody that was not interested in
[18:18] relationship with God they were more
[18:21] interested in building their ownself
[18:23] up oh man I'm not going to finish it off
[18:32] let's go to Matthew
[18:36] 26 and kind of read another version of
[18:39] this
[18:39] story told To Us by
[18:55] Matthew okay this starts at verse 6 but
[18:57] we're going to kind of skip through that
[18:59] uh that uh retailing um he said where
[19:04] where verse 13 whereever this gospel
[19:06] shall be preached in the old world there
[19:08] sh also this this woman has done be told
[19:10] a memorial for her then one of the 12
[19:13] called Judas escari went unto the chief
[19:14] priest and said unto them what will you
[19:17] give me and I will deliver him unto you
[19:20] and they covenanted with him for 30
[19:22] pieces of silver and from that time he
[19:25] sought opportunity to betray him
[19:29] now I won't I I won't read uh just to
[19:31] save time I won't read in in Mark 14 but
[19:33] you can if if you want to but look
[19:36] there's a story there's a story of two
[19:38] people there two the two different
[19:40] strange if you will one that wanted
[19:43] communion with God that wanted a
[19:45] relationship with
[19:46] him and the other that just wanted to
[19:49] build himself up
[19:53] now I was I was kind of getting
[19:56] somewhere let me see
[20:02] let me see what I'm going to
[20:10] do all right let me let me skip over
[20:12] this cuz you remember last time in the
[20:14] in the lesson I kind of briefly showed
[20:16] this this is Bloom's taxonomy which is
[20:19] how they they teach kids in school that
[20:22] they start off with
[20:23] knowledge and they they they build up
[20:26] this pyramid now see you got two
[20:29] pyramids you got two ways of looking at
[20:32] it there's one that wants communion with
[20:35] God and the other wants to build
[20:38] themselves up I was going to read um the
[20:41] three things that that Nimrod wanted
[20:44] when he built the Tower of
[20:46] Babel and those are the things I believe
[20:48] those are the same three things that
[20:51] that uh maybe Judas wanted there three
[20:55] things that kind of that kind of stumble
[21:00] it it it gets you off of communion let's
[21:03] turn over to Genesis
[21:05] 10 I'm going to try not to rush a little
[21:10] bit cuz I
[21:14] want my goal is for everybody to
[21:17] understand I so let me just just relax a
[21:21] little bit and we'll just take our time
[21:23] and if we run into next Sunday then that
[21:25] that'll be
[21:27] fine
[21:33] let's go to Genesis 10
[21:41] and verse 8 says Kush beg Nimrod and he
[21:45] began to be a mighty one in the
[21:47] earth and if you go to verse 11 it says
[21:51] the whole earth was of one language and
[21:53] of one
[21:55] speech sounds like communion again
[21:59] everybody
[22:01] was brother Bram said when he explained
[22:03] this little story he said everybody was
[22:05] in one Accord they they they they
[22:07] believe one God they you know believe
[22:11] they just spoke one language and and
[22:14] then Here Comes Kush with a little
[22:16] saying and he put it in nimrod's hand
[22:19] and he took that saying and turned it
[22:22] into something to he he began building
[22:25] that's always how it starts it starts
[22:26] off with a little this a little saying
[22:28] and then it some becomes something
[22:30] tangible over time and and that's that's
[22:33] the same thing Judas had J just Judas
[22:35] something the devil was speaking to him
[22:37] a little saying and then he turned
[22:39] around and here comes 30 pieces of
[22:42] silver that he's he's willing and
[22:44] dealing with it starts off uh you can
[22:48] you can see how these everything just
[22:50] ties together the seals the statue of
[22:52] perfect man Genesis 1:26-27 Daniel 70
[22:56] weeks Daniel 70 weeks is talking about
[22:58] by bringing reconciliation to the nation
[22:59] of Israel uh he you know all the all the
[23:04] sixfold purposes to bring reconciliation
[23:07] and uh end of sin and all those things
[23:10] but but look in Genesis chap 11 the
[23:13] whole earth was of one language and of
[23:15] one speech and it came to pass as they
[23:17] journeyed from the East that they found
[23:19] a plane in the land of Shar and they
[23:21] dwelt there and they said one to another
[23:23] go to let us make brick and burn them
[23:26] thoroughly and they had brick for Stone
[23:28] and slime had they for Mortar and they
[23:31] said go to let us build us a city and a
[23:33] tower whose top May reach unto heaven
[23:35] and let us make us a name lest we be
[23:37] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[23:39] whole earth what do you think that
[23:41] sounds like let's build us something big
[23:45] that stretches all the way up to heaven
[23:47] so that we can get to close to God by
[23:51] knowledge that's not God's plan we know
[23:54] what God's plan is don't we we should
[23:57] right
[23:59] and and of course we're going to read
[24:01] that God had a problem with
[24:03] that uh and and the Lord came down to
[24:06] see the city and the tower which the
[24:08] children of men build it and the Lord
[24:10] said behold the people is one and they
[24:12] have all one language and this they
[24:14] began to do and now nothing will be
[24:16] restrained from them which they have
[24:18] imagined to do go to let us go down and
[24:22] they confound their language that they
[24:24] may not understand one another's speech
[24:27] so the the Lord scattered them abroad
[24:29] from then upon the face of all the Earth
[24:32] and they left off to build the city
[24:34] therefore as the name of it called Babel
[24:36] because the Lord did their confound the
[24:38] language of all the Earth and from then
[24:41] did the Lord scatter them abroad upon
[24:43] the face of all the Earth you can build
[24:45] a tower of knowledge to try to get to
[24:47] God but it'll never work that's not
[24:49] God's plan the the the the latter to of
[24:53] know to to uh to to Unity and Oneness
[24:57] with God is by his word that's the only
[25:00] way you'll ever see God that's the only
[25:02] way you'll ever understand his will is
[25:04] to Value his word and the the the the
[25:07] Judas and the see that they always had a
[25:11] problem with communion when Jesus said
[25:13] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[25:15] blood and they left communion cuz they
[25:19] they didn't really want communion with
[25:22] God they didn't want fellowship with him
[25:24] they were so stuck on their Idols their
[25:26] their their traditions and their their
[25:28] their own carnal knowledge that that
[25:30] that my point is that that's what the
[25:33] whole Christian experience is about it's
[25:36] about fellowship with God and and
[25:39] talking to him and becoming one with him
[25:42] and and and that's why so much of
[25:44] scripture talks about when you go into
[25:46] your secret place you commune with God
[25:50] and then he'll declare it openly now if
[25:53] you if you do it the other way like
[25:55] Judas or like Nimrod and maybe next time
[25:57] we'll get into a little bit more details
[25:59] about nemi but you try to the three
[26:02] things that brother random said he
[26:03] wanted to do let me let me switch back
[26:05] to that he wanted to build a strong
[26:07] nation which he did he wanted to
[26:10] propagate his own religion which he did
[26:11] he wanted to make a name for himself
[26:14] which he also
[26:15] accomplished and if you see that's
[26:18] backwards God go let God
[26:22] make put you in a like like in Proverbs
[26:25] if you go to try to sit at the high
[26:26] place you might get moved down to the
[26:28] lower place but sit at the lower place
[26:30] and let God put you up and that's that's
[26:33] what the plan is now you know Nimrod he
[26:36] wanted to do three things and God wanted
[26:39] to do three
[26:41] things we maybe we'll talk about that
[26:43] next
[26:48] time
