open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see us brother Lewis combs I want to see you the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you [Music] [Applause] [Music] to power as we say I [Music] shining in the light of your glory love as we sing Oh leo Oh [Music] I want to see praise the Lord Jesus good to be in the house of the Lord thank God for giving us another day another opportunity to come to a midweek service amen praise God you love the Lord you're excited about Jesus Christ you're a Christian you should be Amen but if you're not a Christian then you'll be sad and depressed and it's cold outside and I want to be home under the blankets but I want to be under this blanket tonight they man that's what covers me tonight a man so let's let's let's go to the word and hmm I don't want to keep you standing too long so I appreciate brother Dale giving us another opportunity again appreciate him and appreciate the confidence that he has in us ministers amen here at the church to share what God has given us to you all they matter praise the Lord if you want to turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 and we start at verse 24 hmm I don't know if they got the little issue fixed back there that they were having with the notes I sent them but hopefully they did I was trying to put the notes in the same way that were the way but they'll usually usually do it you know by a number you know on the side and all that but little something went wrong there so we're working on it we're getting there amen amen what title this the perfect image of Christ and his bride amen it's message 101 but you know as Peter told them and second Peter I believe it was chapter 1 it says I won't fail you to put you into remembrance of these things lest you forget them amen and maybe maybe we might hear something tonight that somebody may need yeah praise the Lord because sometimes listen sometimes I hear I've heard brother Dale brother Wade some other other ministers here preach and then it just started somewhat just kind of goes over right but then months later another brother or the same brother comes and preaches the same thing and then it just strikes then you see so you kind of had to hear it that first time but then it's the second time around where it really sticks amen so um let's just let's just go to the word verse 24 says and God said let the earth bring forth living creature forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image in our image all right after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen then we're just gonna pray and then we'll we'll read another scripture there in just a moment so let's just bow our heads our gracious Lord once again we appreciate Father the opportunity to come before your people Lord God while there's just not any people but I believe it's the bride of Jesus Christ right here father God and thank you Lord Father for the opportunity that we have to not just speak your word but to hear your word Lord and father I pray that you would just get me out of the way Lord so that I would be able to be of edification to the people and you be glorified through what said and done this evening Lord father God may you continue to meet the needs amongst us so many sick ones amongst us Lord I pray that you would just heal touch those bodies Lord God do father God as you have died and you have you have already paid for Lord God those things and so we're just waiting for the manifestation of this healings father God to take place in their bodies we love you and we thank you we commit the rest of the service into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise God you may be seated this even if they want to if they want to pull up he fees chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 verse 7 hmm it says but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth is the speaking of Jesus he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things remember he was it was given all power over all power over heaven and earth amen and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now watch this verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ now verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man so you found one perfection on verse 12 and then another perfection on verse 13 unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen well we'll discuss that in just a little while but as I said we want to talk about the perfect image of Christ in his bride amen and and later on just as a just as a word just so that you know I'm gonna give a little report about the mission trip that we did last last month so first and foremost I will thank each and every one of you all who who gave an offering and you certainly didn't have to do that appreciate brother Dale appreciate each and every one of you that took part and helping sending us over there amen and we'll just kind of let you all know what happened it was a short time but I believe I was done God had it planned like that way amen so so we just I'm trying not to be long this evening although I have some content that I want to get to you so so what is the definition of the word image the word image says that it's a reproduction or imitation of the form of a person or thing a mental picture the thought of how something looks or might look a visual representation of something a tangible or visible representation and then I like that last one a person strikingly like another person they meant this image that we're discussing here is that we're going to start talking about here of course his genesis is Adam in Genesis 1:26 brother Wade's favorite verse and we know that that he could not God could not create man in any other image but his image amen and so therefore when Adam came came forth out of out of God he was just like God amen it was that spirit man you know before before the the flesh came on Adam Adam had dominion over all things amen there was nothing that Adam could not do amen praise God so God had an image and he wanted man to be molded into this image amen now some some quotes if they want to pull up say I got they printed me out the number two you like you like brother Dale now saying pull out number two alright so we've read some of these quotes before and you've probably seen these quotes and just kind of solidifying the the the subject here so let's start here so he couldn't just leave at that state he had to leave something with it so he said let us plural make man flora in our own image let us make man in our own image so then when God made his first man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man in the next one and I think they did fix it number three okay um the pillar of fire 1953 now the world's without form and void and water was upon the deep we're in Genesis one now see then he made all the plant life then after a while he made man in his own image and if he made man in his own image he had to make him something on an order of that supernatural beam right that's God amen and number four hmm the message the Messiah or the Branham says towards towards this last part now he is made in the image and likeness of God that makes his when God made him God gave him some of his spirit part of his life and he's in the likeness and the image of God amen and then let's read number five and then in the masterpiece brother Branham says but finally there came forth upon the earth a perfection and that was a man now I like the way he words it a perfection amen praise God because Saints remember we're supposed to come back to that same perfection amen praise God it started out perfect it must go back to perfection amen praise God and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image amen praise the Lord Jesus so that is what Adam was Amen it was an exact replica of what God was they meant now I can't remember was but Adam we know he had his his limitation was that he couldn't he couldn't be a savior right right he had all power but he couldn't be a savior you know because he couldn't save himself when when he failed you see he couldn't he couldn't save Eve when she fell they meant so so there was a limitation there but you get the picture of what I'm trying to say there was a perfection amen Adam was just like Jesus Christ amen praise God now so we see that in brother Branham now I encourage you all and I believe this is one of the messages of correct me if I'm wrong brother but they're one of the message that you requested the church to listen to this masterpiece listen to that message it's very good very good and if you listen to it already but listen to it again amen because he brings out some pretty pretty amazing things there and and so him he was he was he was talking to us about Moses and about the statue that Michelangelo made and that he created and that statue of Moses had a flaw amen because when Michelangelo had created it in had brought it up to a certain point and it was so real in the image that Michelangelo had for for Moses was so real to him that he thought he wanted the statue to speak and so he wanted it to speak it because he wanted to speak he struck it on the knee and when you look at it now there's a flaw there on the right hand side of the knee of that statue of Moses and we know that but he's all he's typing in that message he's typing you know what that what that that that it had to be struck just like Jesus had to be struck on on Calvary we see that Eve Adam had to come out out of a they men so Adam was struck as well on the side right out of her out of him came Eve and he uh you know God took out a rib and Eve came forth amen praise God and Eve was perfect there was no flaw there amen contrary to what people may say around the message you know that but they'll splendid before you know that he was just a byproduct you know but I believe you know cuz when Adam when Adam um when he fell asleep and when he woke back up the Bible says that God brought just like he brought to the Adam all the animals for him to name he brought Adam Eve amen and I said it before I just can't imagine you know it's just like when a man is gonna get married and what is the father when when the bride's father what is he doing he's bringing the the bride over to him as he's standing here waiting for her to come down the aisle he's excited he's happy amen now I can just imagine that Adam was just standing there as eveing for the father was bringing Eve to Adam amen it was it was a wedding taking place right amen so there so Eve was perfect she was beautiful she was just like Adam amen and this bride a man in the end time has to be just like Christ again praise God again we perfect it started all perfection and it must end up in perfection again amen praise God now of course we know that Satan came in in the picture and he marred the image amen he marred this image that that he had made he sin came in the picture and all and and we know that God had to start a process of restoring again the word amen praise God and so we see that God starts restoring his word through the four patriarchs first they meant he starts with the foundation of the restoration that started with Abraham god of course gave him the circumcision and last month I talked about a series about circumcision of the heart and then but it all started with Abraham amen and you know as God gave Abraham that that commandment the circumcision it was passed on through amen even unto the apex amen which was Moses say men at that time he still was practicing circumcision amen why because it was God's Word it couldn't it couldn't it could not go down it could not be faded away because it was God's Word amen - Abraham Amen so brother Branham says here in the message the masterpiece he says they could bring up number six I believe it is and now Abraham was the foundation of faith let's say it had four foundations the foundation of faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was perfection right there is where he could set the monument upon not the first foundation the second foundation the third foundation but on the fourth foundation and we know Joseph and in that message brother Branham talks about how Joseph typified Christ and we've heard brother Barron speaking about that many times amen but it was the stature that that that faith that Abraham had a man started or that foundation was faith a man with Abraham right and why our foundation is it starts with faith right Amen you're born again have faith praise God and you have to grow into the stature of a perfect man right so that was the foundation and then there comes the apex a man which was Moses Amen Moses came on the scene and he was as far as I know he was one of the first prophets that he was given the commandment to speak the word and things came into existence not of his own doing but God was on in there working amen and so Moses we know he was a major profit brother branham in our day was a major profit right Moses was commanded to speak the word brother branham was commanded to speak the word amen Moses had called out a chosen people for God what did our prophet do in this day called out a chosen people for him amen praise God and through Moses we had several books written of the Old Testament as well including the book of Genesis letting us know that Moses had went back into the mind of God back in Genesis Amen praise God and it was Moses right there he was the apex of the word just like our Moses for our day brother Brandon I believe God showed him back in the day in Genesis Amen showed him things amen praise God and so God was was dealing with Moses but it had to start with those four foundations first right with with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Joseph amen praise God and then that and then the apex of that word then could come forward amen how many are with me to see I'm just trying to go kind of slow amen praise God but at the same time trying to go kind of fast I don't want to make words man no anyways but so we just thank God amen so through Moses we also received the command say man and there was certain Commandments amen that were given to us amen conduct order and doctrine and then it's our day praise God amen now but God was not done yet with Moses Moses went off the scene and we know that there was there needed to be more word to be restored amen and that word needed to come through the prophets amen through the prophets priests judges amen that came after Moses amen and brother Branham said brother Branham said I call it the fivefold ministry of that day amen praise God but brother Branham he told us that these prophets and they were building the body of Jesus Christ amen praise God and if you want to bring up number seven will read this quote real quick real quick says and then come finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets they meant and here comes the head of all of it Jesus came on the scene there when his headpiece was put up on it we find in him the entire handiwork of God we find him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again God has the perfect masterpiece again they meant so throughout all of these prophets prophesied Elijah Isaiah and all of these prophets amen even the minor prophets God was still in restoration mode amen for his word amen bring in restoration that that restoration back there amen praise God built in the body of Jesus Christ they meant because there was to be an apex praise God come in to come in later on amen now we know that John the Baptist amen when he came on the scene I call him the pre apex it was the pre apex of those prophets before Jesus came amen he was the last May he was the last major prophet of the Old Testament and what was he to do it was to introduce the Messiah amen and John the Baptist was the only Old Testament prophet who could put his ministry back in the scriptures amen because they asked him they said where where are you who are you are you that Christ are you that one that's to come he said I'm not and they said well then who are you and he said I'm the voice of one that cries in the wilderness see quoting Isaiah 40 verse 3 amen and he was the only one out of the other prophets the prophets of the Old Testament as they were speaking they didn't they probably didn't know what they were they were doing half the time you know or even saying half the time but the word was coming forth and some of them they didn't want to be in that position like Lord what do you have me here to do this amen but they were commanded to speak the word and they could only do that amen and and you know a true Christian in this day a man why does he act the way he act what does she act the way she acts amen you can only do what's God's put inside of you amen i if it's not in you to be a Christian then you won't be a Christian you won't live like a Christian you won't act like a Christian they meant but if God has placed his spirit in you amen it'll quicken amen it will change you from day to day praise God amen so here comes John the Baptist and he introduced the Messiah amen and brother Branham came on the scene and this day and man what did he do he pointed us to Christ amen so brother Branham was a type of John the Baptist as well amen pointed us to Christ saying here comes the Lamb of God amen praise the Lord and we know that brother jesus said that there there have not risen or greater than John the Baptist he said notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he amen praise God speaking of speaking of you and me amen because John the Baptist he introduced us to the word amen but now it's you and me with the word inside of us hey man praise God making us greater than John the Baptist amen praise the Lord amen I believe this is one of the quotes yes verse eight I'm in quote eight number eight they bring that up John looking unto Jesus John the greatest of all prophets he was the one that introduced Jesus Jesus said he was greater than any man had been born did you ever think why that was all the rest of them spoke of him the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet that's the Bible said so and then all the other prophets it come to them in visions but when the word came to John it was flesh amen so Jesus right there vivid standing in flesh Jesus was the word he is the word he always was the word but here's where the fullness of God was made flesh and dwelt among us amen when he come to him in the water he was a prophet and if the word is made flesh has got to come to the prophet the word wherever it is it must come to a prophet because a prophet is the one is the word comes to and John was the prophet of the day praise the Lord amen so that was John the Baptist the pre apex and then finally came the apex amen which was the head a man that word body praise God Jesus Christ amen and we know that that that that he was so perfect and brother Bram speaks about this in that message the masterpiece but he was so perfect that God Himself dwelt in him amen praise God and he was exactly just like what God said amen he said if you see me you've seen the father amen so when you looked on Christ amen you were looking at God praise the Lord yeah and he could only do a man what the father showed him praise God so he was the apex of everything that those prophets in the Old Testament was was was bringing forth in visions here comes the apex Amen it was Jesus Christ they meant praise the Lord and and we know that also that apex Jesus Christ just like Moses Amen he spoke the word Amen Jesus Christ when he came on the scene he also spoke the word Amen praise God and we know that he was given authority to do that in Mount Transfiguration he said the the the father came down and said hear ye him amen so all the authority was on Jesus Christ they meant praise God and and of course this great apex he died for us amen praise God and I'm thanked I'm thankful that he did any man praise the Lord because where would we be without without him him amen praise the Lord and so brother Brown says here in the Knicks in the next next one number nine a lot of these they come from the same message the masterpiece it says remember Angelo could only cry out and smite the image and say speak but how different it was to God the great sculptor when he made a man in his own image so perfect that it reflected him God spoke through the image of man showing what he he would do he spoke through the prophets as they were in the potential image as he was bringing it up to the head amen but when he coming in the head he was all the image of God he was portraying himself then smitten for us now he is the masterpiece to us the gift of God Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we never forget that amen praise God so now the full apex was on Jesus Christ amen and we know that he is the head praise the Lord but the head amen he's not just a Cornerstone but he's also the head stone amen praise God that cornerstone has now become the head stone amen praise God didn't need that doesn't mean that he stopped being the cornerstone no he's still the cornerstone amen he's still the head stone a man because some people must see him first maybe as a cornerstone amen they may they may need eventually amen they will see him as a headstone amen praise God now and then of course we come down amen the bride of Jesus Christ had to come out through Jesus death amen we know that when Christ died he came forth on the day of Pentecost the bride came forth on the day of Pentecost perfect amen no fault no denominations no nothing involved there a man she came perfect amen but of course we know Satan had came on the scene again tomorrow the image amen tomorrow what God was doing amen so then God had to go into restoration mode again praise the Lord amen but you know God has a purpose for all these things amen praise the Lord because his whole his whole thing is all about Redemption amen this whole thing that we see in our day it has nothing to do but with it has to do with with Redemption amen God's just concerned about redeeming amen praise the Lord and it's not bring him back amen putting it back in into a different condition no it's putting it back in the same condition that it was in the original amen praise the Lord when you go to the when you go to the pawnshop amen and you put something you pawned something and you want to take it back out you expect for them to give you what you put that what you gave to them amen not something different amen praise God so you go in to redeem that what that was yours that belongs to you amen praise God now so we know Satan came into picture and of course brother Branham talks about how the bride fell at Nicaea room and she had to die out in order to spring forward with life amen just like Jesus had to die amen that that life may come forth same thing with the Bride of Christ they meant if the corner of wheat does not fall and die and rot then there was no life to come forth amen praise God and God said I will restore says the Lord amen praise God and he was going to restore amen and so God started another rebuilding process they this body again praise God praise the Lord Jesus now if we turn let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2 and it's I'll get used to this you I'll get there number 10 is it amen praise God Ephesians chapter 2 because we know that God he started building a man the body of Christ by the foundation of the apostle's amen just like he started with the foundation back in the Old Testament with the patriarchs then he starts now again with the foundation of the Apostles if he's chapter 2 it says now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone they meant in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit amen so this this restoration process starts out with the with the Apostles amen with Mark Matthew Mark Luke and John amen and then and all those all those all those and we know all these things amen but that's how it needs to start and so God continued this building process through the church age messengers again amen praise the Lord and then through the fivefold ministry amen and this in this hour amen and all these parcels and prophets and messengers faithful ministry culminated to a pre apex amen and this day as well praise God and the pre apex that I'm talking about just as John the Baptist was the pre apex amen to Jesus Christ they meant brother Branham came on the scene amen praise the Lord and we know that throughout church the seven church age messengers brother Branham being the seventh church age messenger and he introduced us as I said earlier to Christ amen praise God and we know that this message is the capstone amen praise God and as you I don't know if some of you were here last time but I preached about when we crossing over into into on to the other side into the promised land and even when the Israelites when they crossed over to the promised land they're still they still had to fight they still had to take full possession of their of their inheritance amen praise God and and we maybe in this message a man and maybe in this message for 50 years amen but we still have to fight and take full possession of our inheritance praise God a man there's still a devil out there a real devil that we need to fight amen praise God because just as the children of Israel that when they crossed over they had to take over Jericho amen Jericho wasn't going to take over itself God had already told him that they needed to take over Jericho and there so therefore they needed to they needed to conquer but it wasn't a man it was through the help and guidance of leaders of ministry of that our priests but at the same time who was leading them for real it was the Holy Spirit Joshua at that time a man witnesses a type of the Holy Ghost amen and it's the Holy Ghost that's leading the bride amen the the Church of God in this hour amen and it's not it is it is man but at the same time it's God through men amen praise God because we're gonna read something here in just a moment that it that it's it's that the man a man cannot lead you to the other side or can't lead you a a head Amen if it's not God through the man then then it that it's man can't lead you amen praise God so so just like the children of Israel crossed over to the promised land they still had to fight and conquer Jericho amen we need to fight and conquer our Jericho I mean we're maybe in this message amen but we have to fight and conquer this Jericho amen this Jericho still needs to fall amen we're waiting for the redemption to wit amen the the witness the retention of these bodies amen praise God Jesus Christ came to that praise the Lord and now this body that's being built again this restoration of this body of this broad tree amen must needs to come to that as well praise God praise the Lord so now how many are still with me a may I understand the one I'm trying to say praise God again message 101 but you I hope this isn't new to somebody to you a man they praise the Lord so and we know now that God he's putting the finishing touches to this image amen through the fivefold ministry and that's our day amen they're there therefore we cannot look down upon the fivefold ministry because it's in the word it's in there it's part of the word amen we need the fivefold ministry but as we were as we as we will look here in just a moment it's the Holy Ghost through those man praise the Lord is and it's not really through those man but it's the gifts a man that those gifts that God has given those men praise Lord because they weren't durr's and they're not their gifts those gifts were given to them for us praise God amen praise the Lord so if we turn to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 let's just read this here amen and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now some people they think that that what that scripture is speaking about is that he gave some you know that not all of them are gonna be apostles and that not all of them are gonna be prophets not all are gonna be evangelists which is true you know that's not but he gave some apostles in other words we all need these fivefold ministry right amen it's not that that that you are gonna you're your key ministry is the is the pastor and you can't receive anything else from any of the other ministries no you need all five of these ministries amen praise God but one of them is going to speak to you more praise God God is going to use one of those to speak to you more to cause you a man to draw closer to Christ amen praise the Lord so you know some of us and evangelist is what speaks to us more amen that's perfectly fine but you can't neglect the pastor either some of us may need a pasture you know to speak to us more but you can't neglect the teacher or neglect the Evangelist you see you need all all of these amen in order to for this body a man to be fully grown amen praise the Lord now verse 12 let's look at this because I want out this is our this is where I want to concentrate amen I'm just kind of I was bringing all that foundation now I want to concentrate on this verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ praise the Lord now if we look at that in and if we bring number 12 real quick number 12 and then we can go back to this one that word perfecting there is the word cut out dismiss and I'm glad that Greek sounds like Spanish because I can pronounce it got artis mas which means complete furnishing or equipping amen praise God this is what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do for the body of Christ amen it's to equip you Amanda just as we said here the the the the minister just all he does is just kind of takes the scales out from your eyes amen praise God sometimes we we got our scales the scales have been removed on Sunday but on Tuesday they're back on again and I don't know and so you need Wednesday to have them removed again they men praise God we need to constantly have that word be around that word be ministered to amen because why we are sheep amen we need guidance amen we need we need we need somebody live that can help us for the things that are taking place in this our day you see amen praise the Lord you know we know brother Branham he spoke in the tapes and he spoke about things amen that was let's take for example Elvis Presley you'd speak to the young people today they can't identify with Elvis Presley they don't know Harley of them they don't even know who Elvis Presley is right but when you're dealing with the youth Amen why do you you know I've learned day if you start talking to them the modern things that they know about the kind of music and artists and things that they know about then it kind of strikes a chord with them and then it kind of it they listen to you more you see but when you start talking about Elvis Presley or just reading what brother Bram said about Elvis and the other the other characters that live back then I don't know but I had my time you know you all know my days was Michael Jackson and all that but yeah bad that's right and so now not diminish it but brother Branham was hitting a spirit at that time you see it's that same spirit do you know and so so we need we need we need not to forget a man that it's okay that we listen to the tapes you have to listen to the tapes amen but of course as I said last time you know we need also live ministry as well praise God because there's things going on in our day that a pastor and a minister can deal with that that need to be dealt with at that time a man that cannot be dealt with through the tapes you see what I'm saying you know how can a pastor a pastor would not be able to give guidance you know just through the tapes a mentor may be met some marriage counselor or something like that you need some live people that are amen somebody that and so this perfect thing are the same so what what this this powerful ministry what is doing is furnishing amen a man is equipping the people amen the Dame but did they continue forward that's what this word perfecting is amen and so if we continue reading amen so in well let me see here in in the next quote and I believe it's number 14 brother Branham says here so the church is not in its right state yet we have to remember that it's not matured so we just have to linger and do the best we can and there's no one can bring it to maturity only the Holy Spirit as we listen to it amen praise God I don't believe it will ever come by man it'll have to come by God now some people could take that and just run off with it but remember amen then that negates what God said in Ephesians chapter 4 you see so they have to run in line I believe it's the Holy Spirit through the man praise God amen it was God using the man in this hard day to bring us to point us to Christ amen brother branham amen why would he DPA it from that praise the Lord Amen so the church is furnished and equipped through this powerful ministry through the leadership of the whole ego stay man and we know and as we know that when the children of Israel they crossed over a man they had leadership at that time as well but Joshua was the one that was the ultimate leader praise God and the word of the Lord would come to Joshua praise God amen now okay so now let's look at this next verse and let's go back to number 11 brothers I appreciate their patience back there yeah amen amens so let's let's read verse 13 amen it says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God amen to the unity of the faith amen praise God unfortunately I don't believe that everybody's come to that yet but we're coming to that amen praise God and know the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so now when you look at this word perfect here it's the word Helios and that's number third 13 number 13 it's the word Pelias it's a Greek which means brought to it and/or finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness amen perfect that which is perfect a man full grown adult or full age mature a man praise the Lord so there's that process now you needed the fivefold ministry amen to help with that amen but they're not the ones who bring you to that amen really it's the Holy Spirit's God through those men that bring you through that - to this perfection amen praise God amen so so because listen Saints I could preach the word brother Dale could preach the word brother Wade brother Aaron brother Bob any minister that comes here preaches the word but if you're not doing your part amen then we can't bring you anywhere we can't take you in you the Holy Spirit can't deal with you a manner you see what I'm saying you have to have your part in this as well they men praise God we can't do it all for you you need to take part amen as well there is a part for you to speak the bride again and we'll look at this later but the bride must prophesy again amen praise God you have a part in this now how do you have a part in this it's simple in your everyday life you sisters when you're in the kitchen and you can minister when you are at work brothers that don't minister a man you can minister there amen young people children at school you can be ministers there amen and it doesn't mean preaching but it means the life that you live for it Amen that that people can see amen that God something's different about this this young man this young boy this this man at work here something's different Amen something something I I'm drawn to that amen praise God so we we can only do a certain part amen God and if you don't if we don't surrender to God fully amen then God can't can't can't fully do his part with you you see amen a simple amen but it's just one of the is the toughest things for us to do we fell God in the most simple things in life what is it because look I've been there I've done that in the simplest things and God all requires for you to do is is read your Bible and pray every day and that is the toughest things for some of us Christians to do why because there's power in those things amen praise God sure you can come and listen to the word but if you don't have your own time with Christ amen then you need that that personal time with the Lord amen praise God amen and and you know that's one thing that's so easily for us to get away from you know because in coming to a church like this where the word is preached and we get deep in the word and and we think we can just lay it all on them all in brother Dale and we'll go in because we go to spoken word church in Lula Georgia no I don't think so you're not going in just because your pastor preaches the word the full word Amen you're going in because you have your own relationship with Christ the Holy Ghost is dwelling in you amen praise the Lord I'm not going in under because brother brother Daylesford I respect but but under brother Dale's coattail amen I've got to go under his tail amen and he's not a coattail he's wings amen I want to be under his wings they men and then but you know under his wings under the leadership of Christ amen is gonna make me want to listen to brother Dale who's gonna make me want to listen to the fivefold ministry it's not gonna say well you don't listen to the fivefold ministry amen no that's as contrary to the word praise God amen so young people I encourage you and and and kids listen just because you come to church every day and your mom and dad bring you to church every single Wednesday and Sunday but if you don't know that you have Christ in your heart you better get to it amen it's got to be a personal relationship with you and God amen not it's not a relationship with you and brother Dale amen I mean that it with respect you know but but Bertha Dale can't take you in amen he can give you the word but you have to do something with that word praise God amen I have to do something with that word amen praise the Lord Jesus so so and then verse 14 says there in in in number eleven says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of man you know your one day here believing two souls and then the next day you're over here believing two Lords and then and then if you mix the two together you get two swords and you're believing all kinds of things you know there's just believing I I wouldn't be surprised if that's the next one that comes out two swords you know you know that's that's souls and Lord just put together but you know but in this hour day Saints it's come more deceiving now a man it's come closer now that it'll deceive the very elect if it was possible right again as I said last last time I I'm Ennis turd and you know but if there's gonna be any deception it's gonna come out of this own message this message amen it's not gonna come out of anybody else the Pentecostals or the Baptist's you know it's gonna come from people within the same message Amen that's gonna say things to you and it's gonna preach things to you that sounds so good and sounds so just I mean they'll give you 99 percent word because that's what the devil does amen but it's that 1% that'll get you that you'll be deceived amen so that's what we need to be in the full word amen praise the Lord now let's see verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ amen praise God in verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love you know in verse 15 it speaks about love and then verse 16 talks about love as well amen now brother branham's it says here in number 15 I believe it is ready could bring up number 15 a minute because remember we're talking about God building this image amen and it is in it and then he restarted it again and at the day of Pentecost bringing coming up through the seven Church Ages and then coming now in this hour day and this in the bride amen and we and we are here Saints we are at this at this with this the this message amen praise God but it must be capped amen it must be capped remember the Brahm says here Tom shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders Amen you remember the pyramid message it's the capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth and kept adding to it till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God amen that's how he makes the individual and caps ium and seals him with the Holy Spirit amen praise the Lord amen and it's not just love Amen but it's perfect love praise God and because we're talking about here the perfect image of Christ amen it's not it has to be perfect love because remember when brother Brandon went over past the curtain of time they said they told him that nothing comes in here and unless it has perfect love amen you're not gonna get there right man without perfect love praise the Lord and that perfect love can only come through Christ amen praise God and so now we look here at the definition of the word perfect and I don't know if I got this written yes it's number 16 we're almost finishing up sayings word perfect I like this it says being entirely without a fault or defect flawless a perfect diamond praise God and you know with for you to be a diamond that reflects light amen because when diamonds are first product you know brought out of the earth you know dug down there they don't look they look bad they look they're ugly they don't look like these things would give off light or anything like that amen but the reason why a diamond gives off light is because it needs to be cut amen once it's cut then it can brick it can give off life because of the different corners that the light is striking and then it can bring forth the light amen praise God and so you know if you're not if you're not cut by the word if you're not cut by the Holy Spirit if you're not as I've been to last time that's that's circumcision for the second time amen just like in it we read in Joshua amen you're not gonna give off light amen you must be cut amen praise God you must have this word cut you amen you must have you must fall sometimes amen in order that you get up and learn the lesson and say Lord Here I am I'm ready to shine you with your light amen praise God so many times Saints that I've had to learn my lesson the hard way and then so many times I've had to learn my lesson the hard way and then I've had to learn lesson my hard way again because just the first time I only learned part of it then I go at it again and then it's the second third sometimes fourth times you know but you know there comes a point where God reveals that to you and says and you say alright Lord there I am mould me a man cut me and it's not just cutting second time but cut me third time fourth time fifth times six times amen praise God and so we continue reading here this this definition of the word perfect says satisfying all requirements accurate corresponding to an ideal standard or abstract concept of perfect gentleman faithfully reproducing the original I like that amen because that's why it's perfect they man that's perfect amen remember Christ when he came on the scene a man after the board the the prophets built his body amen he was the perfect image of Christ amen and he is the headstone amen and so he's the headstone and as we're being called up a man into this into this stature of a perfect man were called to this perfection amen we're called to come back to this perfect image that Christ was a man and really if you think about it Saints his perfect image was he was perfect yes while he was here on earth but his total perfection was after he resurrected amen and from that from the grave amen because why he's redemption of his body amen his his physical body was redeemed at that time amen praise God that's why that's why he died a man as a man because that part Amen wasn't he he was still sick he could still get sick brother Brennan said even he said he had a headache and and all these things they meant just like you and I amen but that's what we are supposed to get to a man as to that perfect image of Christ man at capstone a man that perfect love amen praise the Lord let me tell you saying sigh you know perfect love dwells within us but sometimes we don't portray perfect love amen so I could say I could say man we not all have come to that amen we're still growing up to that amen to that perfect love amen sometimes we just have perfect hate and that's what we demonstrate it's perfect hate a perfect foolishness or perfect you know sometimes our mouth speaks faster than our brains thinking you know and then we we we don't watch what we say in and we and we we offend our brother and our sister amen you know so that's why the Bible calls this this device here uh what does it say yes it's a tongue that the tongue that causes many fires you know that can't be tamed but I believe God through the Holy Spirit has given us the power to attain this Tony amen praise the Lord amen mmm and so I see faithfully reproducing the original legally valid expert a pure total lacking in no essential detail complete amen when Michelangelo was was building this statue of Moses all the details that was there that needed to be done there came a point Amen that he put all the details that he could in that and he figured and he came to a point where this is perfect this is the exact image that I had in my mind and now here it is visible they meant and even from the beginning Christ they meant God had an image about what this bride was going to look like amen and right now I believe through the thoughtful ministry he's going in there and bringing out the details amen in this bride amen praise God you know because it's not just putting forth the foundation amen you must also build that body but and then and then you have the head amen but also bringing in details as well amen praise God but you had Michelangelo when he was building the body of Moses there through that statute he the the curls of Moses beard beard and all these different things you know had to come and then it was a striking replica of what Moses could have looked like now that was Michelangelo's image a man what about you know God's image about this bride a man praise God that he had before the foundation of the world amen brother Branham says here in this message and this is number 17 it says conferences just let this fire come to this fire and after a while you'll find out I'll move to that it will come up through Luther Wesley Pentecost and find out the pyramid will be capped one of these days you know it never was kept the pyramid on the back of your dollar the Great Seal it says and we in America here is the American seal on this side but why did it say the Great Seal the one that Enoch made not pyramid doctrines now because I don't believe in that kind of stuff but they never did cap the pyramid why the capstone was rejected but it will come again someday praise the Lord now watch this and see in that pyramid I've been there it's honed so close to leaving you can't run a razor blade there's no mortar between it it just perfectly sets together like the same stone and when the church gets honed into the perfect image of Jesus Christ he will come resurrect all the saints when he comes and take them with him the Church of the Living God will be caught up amen praise God the resurrection amen will take place amen hey it'll be Jesus Christ through us amen praise God it's not our own power amen but it's his power amen through us praise God amen now and so this perfect image of Christ in his bride just as Moses spoke the word Christ came on the scene spoke the word Amen brother branham came on the scene spoke the word Amen now this bride must speak the word in man in this hour praise the Lord Amen read revelations chapter 10 verse 7 very familiar verse to us he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and this is John speaking this go and and take the little book this is John not saying this part but you know what I mean this is in the voice which I heard that's John saying that God it says from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea upon the scene upon the earth verse 9 and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey a man this is what we must do with this word amen and it's tough to have take the word sometimes it's tough to take correction sometimes bro-down you're smiling at me because you know others is sometimes it's tough when the minister sometimes is preaching unto us and stumping on our feet a man boat you know we need it you know and sometimes it's very sweet you know when we eat it we this word it's sweet to us or we feel so good on Sunday but then come Monday a man it's bitter when we when it comes time for us to manifest this word it's bitter amen then some of us you know we aware why is it Dale said yesterday amen stay in the word yourself and you don't have to depend on brother Dale amen verse 10 and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter amen and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and we know that John he was a was a type of the bride amen and so this bride Amen must speak again praise God must speak the same word that was spoken from the beginning amen must need speak to beef must needs to be spoken again and this our day amen praise God that creative word amen praise the Lord Amen praise God so so we see that we see that that's the image that we need to come to amen praise God and finishing and finishing I just want to mention this little because I'm just seeing the time and I need to get to these slides but a couple of years ago we were with brother brother Joe and brother Bob and and their families and we were at the incoming Georgia and we went to this little fair they have over there and they had this little section where there was a wood wood amanda was a wood sculptor right and he would take piece of log and it would take this log and out of it came he would with chainsaws he would build a make a bear or he would make an eagle or he would make you know just different things that he had in his mind they meant well it was the first time that I had actually seen this I knew about this but I had never actually seen this taken place and so we got there and we sat down and there was some some benches around there and we sat down and this man we see that right before the demand actually takes this log he's there prepping a man his tools of what he's gonna do a man praise God he's prepping all his chainsaws and he had about six or seven chainsaws right there with him laying around him all of them different sizes sighs teeth and and so he's there prepping and putting gas in them and putting oil in them amen and so after he's done that amen he goes into this little cage amen and in this cage it's dirty amen he's got it's full of woodchips everywhere and but that's where he's gonna create his masterpiece hey man praise God and so I was kind of looking at that I'm thinking you know that's kind of like well you know God amen he puts us in this in this world amen and this world is dirty and filthy amen the sin amen but that's where he is building his body amen praise God in the midst of this darkness in the midst of this world in the midst of this sin infested world this is where he's building his body amen praise the Lord and so he goes in there and he's prepping his tools amen after he had prepped his tools and and I believe his little chainsaws a man is kind of like the thoughtful ministry in this heart day amen praise God and it's the it's the fivefold ministry man that that that that that he's he picks up and he takes this piece of dirty log first of all and he brings it over into this area this work this is where he's gonna work at and it's got it still has the the bark on it and everything I mean this is raw and he takes that and sets it on a little foundation and and so that he could say they can stay steady that way he could work on it right and you know that's kind of like God when he comes to a man and he has to put us on a firm foundation first in order to work on us right and you know the Bible says stand still and see the salvation of the Lord Amen if you don't stand still he won't be able to work on you amen stand still Amen that way you can see the salvation of what God can do in your life amen but if we're always running and doing our own thing trying to do it our own way and trying to move for you know God can't work with you amen so that log sits that he puts that log in there and then he takes this big chainsaw and he cranks him [Music] and he starts going at it bleach and cutting big pieces up on it hmm shrim pieces are flying all over the place from one piece over here one piece over there and he doesn't care where it's flying you know they're just going all over the place and he's taken in that I believe to me that's kind of like the Evangelist that comes in here amen and he started cutting in and bringing in it doesn't matter where the pieces fall amen this thing has to take a certain shape amen so that the Evangelist comes in and it brings us to a place where we can repent amen kind of smooth it so that we can get a little smooth you know kind of kind of see that we have this world still on us that's why you needed to cut that bark off you know praise God and so so then he comes and he brings this other little smaller chainsaw and that little chainsaw he starts adding a little bit more details to the log amen and the people are around looking and they're wondering what in the world is he creating there they're there they're in there wondering you know what is this that is going to come about this this image that he has in mind but the whole time the the sculptor he knows what he has in mind the whole time amen it's a mystery to the world but to God it's not a mystery amen you know it's a mystery to the world what God is doing in our lives because all they see is that your sisters wear long hair and wear long dresses and you can you know act like the world you you met young you men you don't act like the world you don't smoke you don't drink you don't go to the bars and all these things but it's God knows exactly what's gonna come out of your life amen praise God so he takes this other smaller one and it's like the pastor and the teacher amen and just kind of starts adding a little bit more details to it but and you still don't see what it is amen then he takes this other little smaller chainsaw with smaller teeth and then and he starts adding a little bit more details to it now you see that it's oh this is a is a bear and you see this bear being formed out of this log that you didn't think a bear would come out of that log but it did a man and so he takes another little chainsaw and starts adding a little bit more details you know now and so he finally gets this this this piece of log this bear now because it's hard to look at it now that it's a it's just a log now to you to to the people around that's a bear you see that's a bear that's not just a piece of log anymore that's a bear amen praise God and in the world they men when they see that God has really done a work in your life a man they're gonna see that's a Christian amen that really is a a Holy Ghost that's how Holy Ghost Christian amen and they might want to be like you a man maybe not but at least you're giving forth the testimony praise God amen and so he was finished with this with this piece of log and he puts it to the side and it looked nice but it finally but what it needed it needed some color so he takes some spray paint and he starts print spraying the this bear now amen and now it just looked beautiful a man it was like the icing on the cake amen praise God and I believe amen you know throughout all these ages God is working and for making this body amen building this body but the icing on the cake a man is when that capstone comes they men praise the Lord caps this bride amen and then she's she'll be just like him amen praise the Lord she'll just she look just like if she look just exactly like the image that he had that sculptor had in his mind they met because that sculptor that that wood sculptor he didn't have just a bland looking bear while he had in mind was a bear with color amen and so that's what needed to come forth and that's why I believe the Bride of Christ amen she's gonna become in full-color you know in full color with that capping of that perfect love spray paint with perfect love you see a man if you can say it that way praise God God's gonna have his way and he's gonna he's gonna build his body praise Lord in this hour and you know Saints what we need to do is we just need to give in to what he's doing don't don't reason it don't think about it your own way think about it God's Way look at it through God's eyes look at it through his word and I believe he'll finish that word in you amen he'll finish that that that he'll perfect that word in you way man praise God and brother Branham says here in the message because we know Saints in 1st Corinthians chapter 13 says verse 9 it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away amen oh we see things right now in part and we don't understand they men how this all is gonna unfold the resurrection and all these things with we see it in part but but all that amen will come a point where we're gonna see it in its fullness hey man we're gonna realize exactly what that word was saying amen it's gonna be manifested in our lives amen and what kind of rejoicing shall we have at that time amen praise the Lord when I was a child verse 11 when I was a child spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known hey man praise God he knew me amen and yet he loved me praise God he had a vision of you and me of how he wanted this bride to be a man but it was an example from it started even from Genesis amen amen and it's gonna end up the exact same way back to that Genesis 1:26 man praise God the Holy Spirit working doing the whole work amen in this body amen praise the Lord you loved the Lord this evening praise God the brothers could bring the the slides real quick we'll switch gears now amen I hope they they were able to bring them up they could bring the first picture up we're just trying to go as quick as possible I hope they got him amen how many love the Lord and I encourage you to read that read that message listen to that message the masterpiece amen and God has a masterpiece in this hour amen praise God is it come okay amen praise the Lord the Hendersons doing this I don't know what you meant praise the Lord hallelujah but you know Saints God is not in a rush you know God knows exactly how he you know we think that we can correct God I know and that we can do it better than God but let me tell you what you know you'll fall flat on your face and you realize that you're not you're not you know you're dependent on him amen praise God all right so we went to Nicaragua and we were gonna go to Honduras there's Atlanta Georgia for some of you who I know are not good with geography Nicaraguan Honduras or in Central America this is Mexico this is Columbia and you're one of those we landed in Managua Nicaragua next slide it was about three hours three hour flight from if you take though from Atlanta to Nicaragua it's about three and a half hours almost four hours flight all right so this is a got there and this is brother Alan right here and he picked up we got there on a on a Wednesday I believe and okay sorry we got there on a Wednesday and it was on a Wednesday right to you it was a Thursday okay and spent the night went the first night as since we got in so late we were we spent the night at a hotel and then a brother came and picked us up the next day and this is brother Alan and just to kind of get of image of what the streets of Managua look like they got these window washers they come and when you're at red lights and they'll come and wash your windows and and they don't ask you that later they they just come and watch the windows okay because you have to tip them you know and I'm and they do it out all the countries I've been to they do that you know so and you got a tip them so next slide just play this video a few a few seconds of the video open place I don't know they had the audio over there or not but you know why sharing their pizza right there as people just gay walking you know I kind of middle-of-the-road we got a young though next slide kind of like looks like kind of like Manila doesn't well no manila's worse now this is brother Alan who was driving right here now brother Alan he's a very wonderful brother and he's a minister yeah and this is his wife his little girl and he's very instrumental have been helping me whenever I go down they're just very instrumental brother when we go down there so next slide this is brother for the Carlos and his wife shot on now sister Sharon brother Carlos they drove us throughout the whole trip from around Nicaragua and to Honduras and he's you know he's very serviceable but they've been trying to have children for the they've been married for about four or five years I believe four years and they haven't been able to have children and so right before we left them they took us to the airport when we were coming back and Christine my wife she she gave sister Sharon one of our prayer cloths and she she wasn't expecting that and she just gave it to her and she was so thankful for that you know and so we're gonna believe a man that God's gonna give him a child next time we were over there you know she's either holding the child or pregnant with a child amen so because they they certainly do deserve it amen praise God so next slide hmm and so when we this is just it felt like a prison this is how you get an idea cuz we were in a car when we went to Honduras driving and driving around Honduras it was a small little car and we had one two three four four seat four in the back seat and then a little baby as well and then another person is sitting in the passenger seat and then the driver and so of course my wife had to sit on my lap so so where I kind of crushed there but not too bad so next slide and so when we this is when we went to Honduras and this is there are five-star hotel the bathroom and you know just and this isn't brother Eric's home and he he was just I'll show you a picture of him in just a moment but there there just ate everything they have they're just willing to share it with you you know and so you can't be picky you know most of the time the water wouldn't come out of that so you'd have to take water in a bucket from outside and I would just bathe with it you know it had sand and maybe little wiggle tails in it but you still have to bathe in it not so brush your teeth with it and everything next slide now this is well this is called a Bella Annabella what it is is it stores water for them this is rain water and they do all their cooking I mean they wash their pots and things they do their laundry with it and you see some laundry right here and m'as in there and they have a whole system that goes around the house that gives them water through this through this right here so if next slide I believe it's just a it's a little video that my wife Christine took now I I give credit to my wife for all these videos and all these pictures save a place here real quick this is Honduras now yes we were only in Nicaragua for what happened is we needed to be in in in in Honduras I don't know if it's gonna play or not all right anyway let's just go to next slide all right and I was saying I'll give my wife credit because you know but there the weight was saying you know some people may ask why you take your wife well my wife usually has never gone to any of the mission trips with me and I really wanted to take her this time with me and so but she was very instrumental because you know for a minister sometimes you have to be dealing with the ministers and in the people and you don't have time to to to to take pictures and to you know to write things down you know in an agenda what has been done well my wife was right there and she was taking care of all that you know not only that but as brother Wade was mentioning Sunday you know she was she was able to deal with the with the sisters over there in the way that I couldn't deal with them you see talking with them and being a benefit to them you know I I wasn't thinking about giving that sister uh a prayer cloth you know but my wife had that idea and she told me afterwards that she did that you see so we're helping each other out man praise God a man so there's benefits to having your wife there with you man praise the Lord so brother brother Eric gallo he is the brother that we helped a couple of about a year ago send some funds there in Honduras to help build a church that they have started over there because right now the group that he's ministering to is is just meeting at a home and so this is the church that we started we helped by the foundational part of it and this this rule bar I think is what it's called Reba Reba Reba okay rutabaga but this is uh this is what they progressed to and just about two nights ago he sent me some updated images and this is board built out you know this is the church this is gonna be the little meditation room for the pastor in this area and so while we were there you know the funds that we accumulated that you all gave we gave them more money to help with this with this out of those funds and so so I'm sure that I'm hoping that that will help them out more and I know it will but so the next slide this is another part of the church next slide it's just in the middle of nowhere real quick let's save this video plays this is the this is the church brother and this isn't an area and in Honduras called Agua Blanca you move nowhere which means when white white water you know they now saint called oh well Blanco which means white one there was a schedule that was given there was that they had put me to minister at certain churches even at a church in Nicaragua before we left knee cry were to go to Honduras but at this time Honduras was going through some political crisis at the moment they had they had just had the elections take place and the the the president that was there and you can go to the next slide this is this is just you're in the middle of cow herd and everywhere just [Music] nextslide alright now this is brother Eric the pastor there that took us in Old Town but as I was saying so they were going through a political crisis during that time and so they when the one of the brothers that called me up and said brother listen you're probably gonna have to come to Honduras quicker than what you were expected to because we don't know what's gonna happen when you come here because there was there was riots taking place all throughout the country because of the president that got reelected again and it looks like that he reelected himself and and so the people were mad and so there was a political thing going on and so it really hindered us from being able to go to all the places that we needed to go there was one time when we were leaving Honduras and we were coming back into Nicaragua that if we had left maybe about two hours later they had shut down the border and we would not have been able to come back to Nicaragua Nicaragua is where our flight back to Atlanta was was gonna be so God had things in control a man but we went through several areas in the capital where they were burning tires they were you know just manifestations you know taking place police and things like that we're out so it was very things were very uh yeah very tense yes so that that this was that Sunday we were with brother Eric and we were going to his church to minister and so you go to the next slide just get a little idea of what the area in that in that area looks like that Lanka is the name of that town and it's there in Honduras next slide just real quick save that video place [Music] [Laughter] you know it's so funny to be with them because you know they may not have much what in this truck that we're riding in I'm in it's 1997 bald tires and you'll see some of the terrain that we went through then this brother Eric drives to this place it's about 45 minutes to church but what he has to go through to get there you know and what this poor truck indoors I can't believe it's lasted that long to get there they told me they said you know don't worry don't worry if you need to worry if you don't hear nothing in the in the truck if if everything is silent that's when you need to worry because everything was rattling there's the truck right here everything was rattling everything was and it was one point when at the the day when they shaved which was that Saturday they should when I took the video there of their church that they were building and all that the radiator went out and the brothers that we were there with and they they they got it going it took a few hours but they got it back up and going you know they had to they just know how to do things you know they don't have everything available at their display there's no autozone everywhere nothing like that they just use some soap and other things and they got the thing going so next slide this is brother brother LEL Eli and he's a minister he's an evangelist he's a this is a pastor I forget his his name but he's about from two hours from the area where we were at we were going to church that morning next slide hmmm this is brother Ellie next slide my brother Ellie just got married about two or three weeks ago so he's about 29 years old just you can kind of get an idea some of the terrain does this is the good part you know this is them going to church every every Wednesday every Sunday and you know Saints brother Eddie you know he I really I'm praying that he'd be able to get another vehicle so because he were he it really needs it and uh maybe that might be something that we can pray about maybe next time that we go might be helping him with a little offering or something because he certainly needs this amen and then we got to this point where he needed to cross this little River area and and so it still has a four wheel at four-wheel drive so he kicks it on four-wheel drive and and here we go going through the river engine we made it all right next slide all right I don't remember this sister's name but but she was very with she was very special because the sister she walks about a mile and a half to church and she's held 87 years old so and she goes to church and walks to church next slide she's very active she sings now they could turn up the volume on this one this is our sister Maria where their sister Maria is sending greetings to all of you to all those that believe this precious message and she wanted to send the personal green this is her house is where where they're holding meetings right the the services right now until they get to church and this is I was preaching to them about the the vine and the branches but we really enjoyed that amen next slide but you can see that you can see their little house you know how it was this is their Sunday School class they don't have a room they're outside children Sunday School class next slide and so they turned this one up they said god bless you sister Christine was out there with them because while while they were they could pause it while they were out there while I was preaching they were having their Sunday school and so my wife was teaching them how to say god bless you and you know in English and so they came in and gave their special after the preaching and they gave a little song special and then they they said they wanted to say god bless you amen sir next slide oh my all right this is their the sisters oven this is how they cook pretty antique the next slide after the service we had some fellowship with the Brethren most of these brethren here there he's a pastor all these are ministers amen next slide and again you know this just just goes to show you know your wife she can be there ministering you know she was helping wash the dishes you know in that little kitchen I can't go in there and just take cup and wash the dishes you know but that's that just shows them you know how much you care you know about about them you know and you want to help out you know next slide this is their home this is brother oh I forgot his name brother Pedro Pedro Peter and this is his wife and that that's their home that we were looking at he's got a wonderful testimony next slide and this [Laughter] brother Dale's probably seen this before [Laughter] this is what happens you know when you're out preaching and the hot weather and things like that your drug I was I was knocked out next slide yeah she did that and they were laughing in there too now that afternoon ministered there in the same same little town but another brother brother lucus Cardona and he invited me to ministers first time I met the brother wonderful brother I really enjoyed his his his spirit you know and ministered at his church that evening next slide and there's there's this church and you want to play this this is after the service [Music] his brother nuke us the pastor is very dynamic so when you go Minister the word you always have to minister to people's uh you know so I have here somebody's phones I'm buddies phone and somebody's laptop and just trying to fix things for them and things like that because they know you work on computers so they think you just can fix it also so Christine took a picture of that the next slide all right and so before you play the video so when we left we were in Nicaragua again there was about two more services I only got to preach in Honduras two times there was about two more services that I didn't get to because of the political crisis we had to leave quickly from the country so the brothers they said it's just you know what next time and when we came back to Nicaragua that was on a Wednesday we had a service that night at brother Allen's dad's Church which is one of the brothers that I first showed you and they started they just they're they're building a church as well and this is the little temporary place that they have available right now if you want to play this little video [Music] slot this is me ministering I am dressed the same way there I believe I wash the clothes that man makes slide and be wrong with that all right and there's a video of ministry tell you there was a lot of mosquitoes in that place flies and things flying around you just ask Ito's you're preaching and you're doing like this and they warned us they said when you go over there you go there's a lot of mosquitoes a lot of things next slide and that's just a picture brother Allen and brother Manuel he's the pastor there this this congregation so next slide all right so my wife and me we just want to give you thanks for allowing us to come through there brother Dale we appreciate and the funds that were given and we just want to say God bless you and thank you for your prayers as well amen that night this is another time but that night after I ministered there in my in Nicaragua that night at 12 o'clock we had to be at the airport so the service was at 7:00 I ended up at 9:00 we ate dinner with them and then at 12 we had to be at the airport because it was a one of those late flights so we got in okay just thank God for His guidance amen praise the Lord so again Saints there was about you know because I told the brothers before we went over that I said brothers scheduled me as much as you can because I just want to redeem the time while I'm there but being that they had that political crisis and all that going on it was very limited to how much I could could have ministered so so maybe next time we owe you know those other churches visit amen so let's stand to our feet and that's just saying something real quick we don't have to have the musicians come let's just is just saying it's just saying Amazing Grace and let's just have a word of Prayer before before we sing our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day once again we appreciate your mercy your grace and love we thank you Father for the opportunity that we had that we opened up your word once again and and here these wonderful things father God of heart you're restoring father God your people and how you're bringing father gotta a bride father God that's to become
