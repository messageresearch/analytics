[30:39] things about kovid
[30:41] for the world it may be one way but for

[30:44] the kovid was nothing but a door to
[30:47] heaven for some of our precious brothers

[30:54] they went to the next place amen and
[30:57] we'll wait on them we didn't lose
[30:59] anybody everything that happens to the
[31:02] believer was predestinated for ordained
[31:04] planned of God and if that was God's
[31:07] choice to to have Isaiah the prophet son
[31:10] and have to have John the Baptist
[31:12] beheaded and to have Brother Ray
[31:14] Montgomery go by a crazy virus so be it
[31:17] that's God Amen and we'll see them again

[31:24] uh every now and then we have a little
[31:26] Eagle that comes with his family brother

[31:32] my heart is different from two years ago
[31:35] when we saw each other and I just can't
[31:38] help but think about Abraham traveling
[31:41] and he's he's gone through Wilderness to
[31:43] some places he's never seen and he's
[31:45] thinking this world is not my home and
[31:48] he's just looking for a place you know
[31:50] and he knows God is the maker of that
[31:52] promised place and he's searching and
[31:54] searching and he meets people and
[31:57] they're just such strangers with such
[31:59] strange ways and that's right oh my but
[32:02] you know God was God was good to him and
[32:05] he gave him the he gave him the answer
[32:07] to all his questions and this message
[32:10] has given us the answer to all of our
[32:12] questions amen we are we are coming to a
[32:16] place exactly where we're supposed to be
[32:18] at exactly the right moment and we'll
[32:22] get to what I told my 14 year old
[32:24] daughter I says honey you get to watch
[32:25] the world fall apart you get to watch as
[32:28] the world is falling apart the things
[32:30] that were said back in the prophets
[32:32] Ministry are coming to pass right before
[32:35] us what an amazing thing yeah you know
[32:38] you get a chance to think while you're
[32:41] driving three hours a little bit more
[32:43] because of the rain and a couple curves
[32:47] you know all of a sudden we got to a
[32:50] place we hadn't been there for a long
[32:51] time and it's called Blood Mountain
[32:54] and I thought how perfect
[32:56] I'm on blood Mountain
[32:59] I'm on the I'm on the road
[33:02] Through Blood Mountain
[33:04] and all those curves and those hardships

[40:29] been doing that for a little while but
[40:31] when he first came along he was just a
[40:32] little kid you know remember we used to
[40:34] come to he'd ride with us in in the van
[40:37] and and he'd have to sit in the front
[40:39] because he got sick
[40:42] going through those curves
[40:45] and and then he he overcame that
[40:50] you know what he could have done what
[40:52] like a lot of us would have done we're
[40:53] not going because we're going to get
[40:55] sick
[40:55] no he persevered
[40:58] he went right on I mean we met we may
[41:01] have to carry a couple barf bags with us
[41:02] but we made it Ryan made it he made it
[41:05] through all that now he's going up here
[41:07] by himself how about that
[41:09] so but that's the way the Lord works and
[41:10] it brings it brings a joy to me to see
[41:13] that in in each one of life and brother

[42:03] um
[42:04] remember uh sister Raymond she's
[42:08] about a month from having that baby and
[42:10] she's having some back issues I thought
[42:12] I'd go outside and brother Daniel and
[42:14] her have really traveled a while to get
[42:16] here too and her being pregnant
[42:19] and it was a wonderful day a couple
[42:22] years ago when we baptized her here at
[42:24] the church and I didn't know if I was
[42:26] going to get her out of the water she
[42:27] had that big head thing on her head and
[42:28] I didn't know how in the world that
[42:30] thing got sold was in trouble
[42:32] but she wanted to be baptized so we
[42:33] baptized her anybody ever want to be
[42:35] baptized will baptize them so uh but
[42:37] good to see each and every one of you
[42:38] here now let's go listen to the word of
[42:40] the Lord Brother Chris Long from
[42:43] Flagstaff Arizona where it snows

[42:52] years ago and you you could see the stop
[42:55] sign brother Tom that's all you could
[42:57] see the rest will snow from there down

[43:01] ago of his well it was a hump for a car
[43:03] he had to hunt for his car
[43:06] to dig that thing out so uh it was good
[43:09] that we have this here I'm okay right

[43:17] and forth and see each other and whip
[43:21] but we appreciate him loving with the
[43:23] love of the Lord he said he never met
[43:25] brother Tom so he's getting being able
[43:26] to meet him he's a brother Chris is a
[43:28] good brother he's solid as a rock and we
[43:31] enjoy his ministry here and we
[43:33] appreciate him loving with the love of
[43:34] the Lord so let's sing Open the Eyes of
[43:36] My Heart as he comes to minister for us

[45:47] in the form of the mystical body of
[45:49] Jesus Christ pleasure to be here with
[45:52] you tonight God bless you all what
[45:54] appropriate words that brother Tom spoke
[45:57] you didn't realize that the title of my
[45:59] message is
[46:01] Resurrection
[46:02] by representation
[46:05] amen but unfortunately we're going to
[46:07] have to hit a little dark sock before we
[46:09] get to the light I think that's why the
[46:11] weather's so bad outside because this
[46:14] represents the day when he was entombed
[46:17] backed many thousand years ago
[46:20] and uh really enjoyed brother Dutch's
[46:23] message I tell you what that fed my soul
[46:27] uh that was Eagle food
[46:29] enjoyed it enjoyed it enjoyed it
[46:33] he just texted me a minute ago said he
[46:35] was still driving
[46:36] I told him I went down to the rental car
[46:39] agency and traded in my car for a boat
[46:43] we may get snow but at least we can walk
[46:45] on it
[46:48] amen
[46:50] sure love everybody here it's a pleasure
[46:52] to be here with you I don't need to take
[46:54] up a lot of time introducing myself how
[46:56] about if we just get right into the word
[46:57] and and I'll try to keep her under three
[46:59] hours and that'll you'll be plenty
[47:01] hungry
[47:02] Lenny hungry my wife's already saying uh
[47:06] all right
[47:07] let's go to Romans 8 11.
[47:10] I'm gonna yeah cut the lights right uh
[47:13] Romans 8 11.
[47:15] Resurrection by representation now I got
[47:18] to give you the dark side first but I'm
[47:21] reading this scripture because it's the
[47:22] end result
[47:24] of the Rising
[47:26] of the sun amen I got a pair of glasses
[47:29] in here somewhere no I don't need a pair
[47:31] thank you
[47:33] he loaned me a pair last time and there
[47:35] were some girls glasses and I
[47:38] I just don't go there
[47:41] if you got your Bibles open
[47:44] I tell you Brothers back there in the
[47:46] back I found an app that makes the sound
[47:48] of pages turning
[47:50] there is one there sure is I like to
[47:53] hear the pages of your Bible turning but
[47:56] there is an app
[47:58] that makes that sound so you guys might
[48:00] want to hook it up all right Romans 8
[48:02] verse 11 but if the spirit of him that
[48:05] raised up Jesus from the dead
[48:09] dwell in you
[48:11] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[48:14] shall also Quicken
[48:16] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[48:19] dwelleth
[48:20] in you all right let's bow our heads
[48:23] father we thank you this evening Lord or
[48:25] this afternoon father for the grand
[48:27] privilege of being able to gather
[48:28] together Lord with those of like Faith
[48:31] father unto the shed blood and banner of
[48:33] Jesus Christ Lord we realize that the
[48:36] weather outside father is compensation
[48:39] Lord for what happened Lord 2 000 years
[48:43] ago or so father
[48:44] we realize Lord that while it was dark
[48:47] and gloomy outside Lord you were still
[48:49] working
[48:51] as we desire to work for you today Lord
[48:54] amen bless each and every one that's
[48:56] made the effort to come Lord thank you
[48:58] for traveling Mercy's father in the
[49:00] specials Lord and the and the tender
[49:02] words from Brother Tom Lord
[49:05] help me father I pray to get out of the
[49:07] way Lord
[49:09] use me for your honor and your glory
[49:11] Lord and let he that hath an ear hear
[49:13] what the spirit saith
[49:15] unto the churches Lord for your honor
[49:17] and For Your Glory in the precious and
[49:20] lovely name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[49:23] God bless you may be seated
[49:27] God is good
[49:29] all the time not just some of the time
[49:32] all the time I like what brother Wade
[49:33] said the son is still shining up there
[49:36] yes it is amen amen now it says here in
[49:39] Ephesians uh chapter 1 verse 4 according
[49:43] as he hath chosen us
[49:46] in him before the foundation of the
[49:48] world that we should be holy and Without
[49:51] Blame before him
[49:53] in love
[49:55] now we realize that this is
[49:58] the real the real and only genuine
[50:02] holiday
[50:04] holy day which we can put our actual
[50:08] pulse upon
[50:10] celebrate sometimes Christmas some
[50:12] people do but we know that Christ wasn't
[50:14] born on December the 25th
[50:16] probably born sometime in April maybe
[50:19] late March early may like Lambs are born
[50:23] depending on the weather conditions
[50:26] but this weekend
[50:29] is the one time that we know as
[50:33] Christians that set aside properly
[50:36] and of course it started uh
[50:39] I guess a week or so ago from tomorrow
[50:42] it's a Palm Sunday when he came into
[50:45] town
[50:46] we heard brother Dutch cover that
[50:48] marvelously I tell you what I got I I
[50:50] got some good notes do you mind if I if
[50:52] I if I just go over a couple of things
[50:55] and again I I enjoyed every word of it
[50:58] amen he was preaching to me if he wasn't
[51:00] preaching to you
[51:01] right and I like when he started out
[51:04] when as soon as he said the word
[51:05] Einstein now I'm not a genius I'm not a
[51:09] mathematical guy like that I'm not a
[51:12] scientist but when the prophet of God
[51:14] says something about somebody it always
[51:16] intrigues me and I like to kind of look
[51:19] into that area uh brother Branham even
[51:22] went so far as to say that he went to
[51:24] hear a talk
[51:25] on Einstein that was given by a fellow
[51:28] that was famous back then I know his
[51:30] name but it doesn't come to me it
[51:32] doesn't matter
[51:33] uh but you know he said that Einstein
[51:37] was looking for the center
[51:40] he was looking for the center of the
[51:42] universe and and he was trying to find
[51:45] it by mathematics
[51:47] and uh of course he was a pretty good
[51:50] mathematical guy
[51:53] and I and I know that I wrote this down
[51:55] if I got it right uh uh brother uh Dutch
[51:58] mentioned that um how that Einstein and
[52:01] and and mathematicians and scientists
[52:04] afterwards and so forth
[52:06] um believed believed today that you can
[52:10] travel forward in time
[52:11] okay uh and they and they and they
[52:14] formulate that by uh their their
[52:17] mathematical formulas and he mentioned
[52:19] how that Einstein had had uh made a
[52:22] proof of something and then couldn't
[52:23] find that last little phrase that he
[52:26] needed in that long five or six
[52:29] chalkboards worth of of algebraic
[52:32] equations any and he used the word he
[52:34] fudged he fudged it you know he he he he
[52:37] thought well if I put this number in
[52:39] here nobody will know
[52:45] I think that's what Satan thought by
[52:48] trying to inject the seed
[52:50] into Adam's race
[52:52] I'll put this in here and nobody will
[52:54] recognize it well right away
[52:56] of course somebody that has life and not
[53:01] death
[53:02] somebody eating off the tree of life and
[53:04] not the knowledge of the tree of Good
[53:05] and Evil would immediately recognize
[53:07] wait a minute you fudged it there
[53:10] because we we don't go for that no
[53:13] we want all the work
[53:15] we don't want just part of the word we
[53:17] don't want 99
[53:18] 0.9999 of the word we want all the word
[53:21] now did you realize brothers and sisters
[53:23] that that has been the desire
[53:26] of all of the past Christians Believers
[53:31] men of God and so forth all the way back
[53:35] to the beginning right
[53:36] but God ordained a Time
[53:40] in history
[53:42] where only one
[53:44] portion of his body would be able to
[53:49] come to that fullness of his word and we
[53:54] live in that time it amazes me how that
[53:58] you or I can read a scripture uh hear a
[54:02] message here
[54:04] a sermon preached from a minister and
[54:07] and and you you could have heard that
[54:10] same sermon five minutes five days five
[54:14] years 50 years ago but spiritual food
[54:18] new season
[54:19] it's always in action
[54:24] it's a never-ending occurrence
[54:28] so when he said that they'd proven that
[54:31] that they they believe now now now I
[54:34] don't know that any one of these
[54:36] scientists have ever went forward in
[54:38] time
[54:39] but they believe mathematically it can
[54:41] be accomplished is that right
[54:44] now he also said that these same
[54:47] scientists uh do not believe that you
[54:51] can go back in time
[54:54] all right
[54:56] or erase your past
[55:00] we got news for them
[55:03] but I'm going to tell you folks
[55:05] something that science
[55:07] at the end of its uh equations and and
[55:12] calculations and and postulations and
[55:15] theories
[55:17] proves God
[55:21] so I'm gonna help them right now
[55:26] I'm going to agree with him brother Wade
[55:29] I don't have to go back in time okay
[55:33] but wait a minute I'm going to preach to
[55:36] you Resurrection by representation
[55:40] oh brother Branham told us that the
[55:43] woman at the well as an example
[55:46] uh as she had representation now she
[55:50] didn't know that
[55:52] [Laughter]
[55:54] but she had it anyway and he said the
[55:57] Sadducees and the Pharisees and the high
[55:59] priest and the priesthood and and the
[56:02] Sanhedrin and all them they didn't have
[56:04] that representation So based upon that
[56:07] they attacked
[56:10] the word of God Amen in the flesh they
[56:14] didn't attack the word of God and the
[56:16] Scrolls they believed that they had the
[56:18] revelation of what was in those Scrolls
[56:20] but they didn't realize that the word
[56:24] had been made flesh
[56:26] and that is why they crucified him
[56:29] we don't crucify you for being a good
[56:32] man now
[56:34] but we crucify you for you being a man
[56:37] and making yourself God
[56:41] man you know what it would have been
[56:44] fantastic if Jesus knew that they had
[56:47] representation and he would have said
[56:49] but doesn't it say in Genesis let us
[56:52] make man in our image and after our
[56:54] likeness
[56:55] but they couldn't have swallowed that so
[56:59] he didn't cast his pearls
[57:01] he said I got to turn aside
[57:03] there's somebody waiting for me at a
[57:05] well that's right and I happen to know
[57:08] that I am her representation and I'm
[57:13] gonna resurrect a life that's been
[57:15] laying in her since before the
[57:18] foundation of the world
[57:21] now I'm preaching to you on Resurrection
[57:25] we can go back and we can go through the
[57:27] history uh was it uh was it brother
[57:31] Dutch that mentioned in your and and
[57:32] brother Samuel is I been an eyewitness
[57:34] that for instance over in the
[57:36] Philippines
[57:37] this weekend there it's probably
[57:40] tomorrow morning over there now they are
[57:42] really literally nailing themselves to
[57:47] crosses they've carried them and and so
[57:50] forth and all those things uh and and
[57:52] but but but they're not going to
[57:55] resurrect
[57:57] from the dead
[58:00] and last they were in him yeah
[58:04] before the foundation of the world
[58:08] so my thoughts that I wrote down while
[58:10] brother Dutch was speaking
[58:14] was that we don't have to go backwards
[58:18] God always moves forward what the
[58:22] prophet of God taught us that
[58:25] eternal life is like a circle
[58:28] so if you just keep going far enough
[58:31] you'll go past your past and you'll come
[58:35] right back up to where you came from we
[58:39] don't have to go back we need to go
[58:42] forward
[58:43] is that right
[58:44] yeah that just got inspired when he said
[58:47] that I said oh I see something here you
[58:49] see because what we think of discernment
[58:53] by the prophet is him looking back
[58:55] because we're creatures of time
[58:58] what we don't realize is that the god
[59:01] that we serve never goes backwards those
[59:04] four living creatures always go forward
[59:06] I'm gonna get brother Wade a hat
[59:10] foreign
[59:12] bills on it
[59:15] Postman
[59:17] beekeeper
[59:21] mayor
[59:26] he only wants three bills right now I'll
[59:27] stop right there
[59:32] was the fourth one waiting there's a
[59:35] fourth one waiting
[59:37] I know you do
[59:38] because I'm on your side
[59:44] God is good amen
[59:47] but look where we're at today
[59:51] man I enjoyed that I'll tell you what Mr
[59:53] Goodwin if you missed it I mean you know
[59:55] we understand it people have to do
[59:58] things and
[59:59] it looked like uh he is preaching on
[1:00:01] Good Friday
[1:00:03] but it looked like a bad Friday
[1:00:05] really did
[1:00:08] um
[1:00:10] but it was a good Friday
[1:00:12] the weather outside right now looks
[1:00:14] terrible
[1:00:17] but there will be a sunrise
[1:00:19] I believe tomorrow we'll see it
[1:00:22] but I want to put some emphasis on a few
[1:00:24] things if I can I'm not going to keep
[1:00:26] you a long time
[1:00:28] I hear your stomach's growling
[1:00:31] now I remember uh
[1:00:34] in one of the messages and it'll come to
[1:00:36] me brother Branham is that a Full Gospel
[1:00:38] business Moroccan systems at a Full
[1:00:41] Gospel businessman's breakfast and he
[1:00:43] keeps telling the people at the end of
[1:00:44] the message forget about the cafeteria
[1:00:46] now
[1:00:47] he does yeah he says you go back and
[1:00:49] listen and he picks it up two or three
[1:00:51] or four times don't worry about it it'll
[1:00:54] still be there when you
[1:00:56] because he was bearing down on something
[1:00:57] yeah but let me read let me start out by
[1:00:59] reading something to you out of a
[1:01:01] message if I could uh the brothers I'll
[1:01:03] tell you what they are you know I'm just
[1:01:05] a rookie with these tablet things you
[1:01:07] all know that
[1:01:09] uh and uh perhaps someday I'll actually
[1:01:12] get used to them The God Who is rich in
[1:01:15] Mercy
[1:01:16] 119-65. let's just you want to go for a
[1:01:20] ride
[1:01:22] right now it's a boat but let's go for a
[1:01:24] ride
[1:01:25] okay
[1:01:27] brother Brandon says starting in
[1:01:29] paragraph
[1:01:30] 30. and I was speaking last Sunday on
[1:01:33] the Ephesians how that the Book of
[1:01:34] Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old
[1:01:37] Testament and how was the book of
[1:01:40] redemption you see that's what Easter's
[1:01:43] all about
[1:01:44] and Redemption has two different parts
[1:01:47] don't forget that now come out of and
[1:01:52] entering into first you have to come out
[1:01:57] some people wants to bring the world in
[1:01:59] with him but you got to come out of the
[1:02:03] world to enter into Christ
[1:02:06] did you get that
[1:02:08] okay now we were in him
[1:02:13] we got to come out of the world to get
[1:02:15] back in him even though we never were
[1:02:18] out of him
[1:02:19] okay but you and I came through a
[1:02:22] perversion
[1:02:24] but there's a purpose behind it God has
[1:02:26] a plan you have to come out of unbelief
[1:02:30] to enter into Faith now you see how he
[1:02:32] shifted that amen
[1:02:33] he took us now to a spiritual walk
[1:02:37] everybody is is celebrating the natural
[1:02:40] crucifixion 2000 years ago or so and it
[1:02:44] happened and it has meaning but we
[1:02:47] realize that in the day we live in there
[1:02:50] has been a second crucifixion there's
[1:02:53] been an indictment and it's harsh like
[1:02:57] the weather today
[1:02:58] you listen to that message and you find
[1:03:00] out listen brothers and sisters that the
[1:03:03] ministry of today
[1:03:05] is guilty yeah of crucifying the son of
[1:03:09] God afresh
[1:03:12] that's why the weather's not good but
[1:03:16] what they didn't realize is that God
[1:03:19] brother Branham said this and I may be
[1:03:21] getting ahead of myself that's okay I'll
[1:03:23] just hurry up all right
[1:03:26] he said that the denominational thought
[1:03:29] process bound
[1:03:32] the Holy Spirit
[1:03:34] for nearly 2 000 years now that's
[1:03:38] an entombment yeah
[1:03:41] that's right you know what they do
[1:03:44] whenever somebody dies back in the old
[1:03:47] days they rap them all up
[1:03:50] they bind them
[1:03:53] but brother Branham said never said that
[1:03:55] the Holy Spirit died because it cannot
[1:03:59] die but denominationalism bound that
[1:04:04] Holy Spirit
[1:04:05] by trying to tie it up and put ownership
[1:04:09] on it from a human perspective
[1:04:13] but here's what they forgot to think
[1:04:16] about
[1:04:17] while they were busy binding the Holy
[1:04:21] Spirit to to keep it from accessing the
[1:04:24] people
[1:04:27] Jesus was not in the Tomb
[1:04:30] on Saturday
[1:04:34] they didn't know that because there was
[1:04:36] a big Stone in the way
[1:04:39] they thought he was still bound inside
[1:04:43] that Doom
[1:04:46] but he was busy preaching the gospel to
[1:04:50] the souls that were in prison
[1:04:53] now brother Branham in the message souls
[1:04:55] in prison which is about entombment in a
[1:04:58] way
[1:04:59] okay
[1:05:02] declared to us that it looked like that
[1:05:06] Souls that are in prison and Jesus
[1:05:09] preaching to them was like the third
[1:05:12] pool today preaching to the totally lost
[1:05:16] but that is not all he said he said
[1:05:20] while the third pull is the word being
[1:05:24] preached to the totally lost it's for
[1:05:26] the bride you understand that he didn't
[1:05:31] say it in that message but he said it in
[1:05:33] a message after that it's for the bride
[1:05:38] and that's the difference between you
[1:05:42] and I and all the other churches on the
[1:05:46] planet now I'm not talking about the
[1:05:47] local assembly here I'm talking about
[1:05:49] you being the church we just had some
[1:05:51] meetings last weekend for our 11th
[1:05:54] anniversary and brother Manuel Salazar
[1:05:56] gets up there and says how in the world
[1:05:58] could you stay out of church
[1:06:02] when you are the church
[1:06:06] if you are in the church you're staying
[1:06:09] in the church we're not talking about
[1:06:11] the four walls now we're talking about
[1:06:13] you as an individual House of God
[1:06:18] now we realize that entombment requires
[1:06:21] a tomb
[1:06:24] what is a tomb
[1:06:25] it's a place the dictionary says of
[1:06:28] confinement
[1:06:29] see what that Spirit tried to do it
[1:06:33] tries to confine it's still here today
[1:06:35] it tries to confinement
[1:06:38] the moving
[1:06:40] and freedom
[1:06:43] of the word of God made flesh remember
[1:06:46] they didn't crucify him for being a good
[1:06:49] man
[1:06:51] they didn't even crucify him for being a
[1:06:53] rotten man
[1:06:54] because that was a rotten man on death
[1:06:56] row and they let him go
[1:06:59] is that right
[1:07:01] okay
[1:07:02] whoo
[1:07:04] okay
[1:07:05] better settle down
[1:07:10] place of confinement listen to what it
[1:07:12] says a building house chamber Vault
[1:07:15] structure
[1:07:17] Etc in which a corpse
[1:07:19] is in turn
[1:07:21] now brother Branham told us about them
[1:07:23] cemeteries
[1:07:28] doesn't require a theologian I am far
[1:07:33] from an Einstein
[1:07:35] in the message
[1:07:37] but I realized that if we'll take what
[1:07:40] all those great men were looking for
[1:07:42] through their intellects and education
[1:07:44] and Academia
[1:07:46] and we begin to separate the Bible says
[1:07:50] You must rightly divide the word Hebrews
[1:07:54] 4 12 says the word of God is sharper and
[1:07:56] more powerful it's a discerner you must
[1:07:59] have discernment I know groups of
[1:08:02] Ministries today that claim to follow
[1:08:04] this message that don't believe you can
[1:08:06] have discernment
[1:08:09] only the prophet they say
[1:08:11] no that is not scripture that is not
[1:08:14] message I'll tell you what that is
[1:08:16] that's a tomb
[1:08:18] that's a Whited Sepulcher full of Dead
[1:08:22] Man's Bones that's what the Bible says
[1:08:24] right still with me
[1:08:28] so so what we have here
[1:08:34] is we have a religious spirit
[1:08:41] it's trying to keep
[1:08:46] you captive
[1:08:48] by keeping him captive
[1:08:51] but we have proof
[1:08:54] now what day of the week
[1:08:56] is Friday
[1:08:59] it's the sixth day of the week that's
[1:09:03] why he was crucified on Friday because
[1:09:06] of the number six it's a judgment number
[1:09:10] is that right now today is Saturday is
[1:09:14] that right and today is the seventh day
[1:09:18] of the week and God always runs in
[1:09:21] mathematics that's why I was really
[1:09:23] enjoying brother Dutch he brother
[1:09:25] Branham told us he runs in mathematics
[1:09:28] is not from Einstein
[1:09:30] mathematics is from God Amen it's just
[1:09:33] that man tries to put his two cents
[1:09:35] worth in and he ends up fudging
[1:09:36] everything
[1:09:39] amen he has to
[1:09:43] amen that's what they're busy doing
[1:09:44] today in their Laboratories remember
[1:09:46] when brother Brandon mentioned the the
[1:09:48] men in the Laboratories pouring the test
[1:09:49] tubes back and forth and and somebody
[1:09:51] said stop that don't do that and they
[1:09:56] just looked up and oh
[1:09:57] like zombies and kept pouring their
[1:10:00] little test tubes back and forth look
[1:10:01] where we're at today the brother
[1:10:03] mentioned uh uh covet
[1:10:06] don't tell me that's not some test tubes
[1:10:08] being poured together and and they think
[1:10:11] they're helping Humanity what really are
[1:10:13] they thinking
[1:10:15] do you think that they think they're
[1:10:17] trying to kill people and as I've heard
[1:10:19] population control and ethnic control
[1:10:21] and race control and and intelligence
[1:10:24] control and control control control no
[1:10:27] what they're trying to do and they don't
[1:10:29] even realize that they're being used by
[1:10:31] the devil
[1:10:32] to try to create
[1:10:35] and eaten yeah
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] yes amen
[1:10:40] but it's Satan's Eden already
[1:10:45] and Satan is the only pastor
[1:10:48] he's the only Minister he's the only
[1:10:51] Shepherd he's the only God I know that's
[1:10:55] occupied by killing his congregation
[1:11:01] what's the matter with the guy
[1:11:05] yeah you with me
[1:11:07] this is Satan's Eden
[1:11:09] and there's only one group of people
[1:11:12] that God ordained to be able to
[1:11:14] withstand the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:11:17] and everything he has to throw at us
[1:11:22] and he accomplished it by revealing to
[1:11:25] you and I what he did on Calvary
[1:11:29] every bit of it is in here right
[1:11:32] right I can't hardly preach on Easter
[1:11:36] without bringing up job
[1:11:38] but we'll do that tomorrow yeah
[1:11:40] all right
[1:11:42] I just got done preaching a series on
[1:11:45] job not realizing Easter was coming I
[1:11:48] didn't have him on the ashy for three
[1:11:49] months or six weeks or one year I
[1:11:52] probably preached on it for three months
[1:11:55] but oh there's so much in there
[1:11:59] but at the end of the day
[1:12:01] job caught something
[1:12:04] that apparently nobody else caught and
[1:12:07] he caught it in such a time where it was
[1:12:10] critical
[1:12:11] critical mass
[1:12:13] I know
[1:12:15] My Redeemer
[1:12:17] we'll get there tomorrow listen now
[1:12:19] let's let's get done with Redemption
[1:12:22] shall we
[1:12:24] there there cannot be watch what he says
[1:12:26] you have to come out of unbelief to
[1:12:27] enter into Faith there cannot be one
[1:12:29] thing in your way
[1:12:31] not one all right
[1:12:33] can't be a grave can't be a tomb
[1:12:36] can be a church
[1:12:38] can be your intellect
[1:12:40] there cannot be one thing in your way to
[1:12:42] really have genuine Faith you must
[1:12:44] absolutely leave everything that's
[1:12:47] contrary to the word of God behind see
[1:12:50] behind we're not going backwards
[1:12:55] to enter into faith
[1:12:58] and that was the book of Ephesians of
[1:13:00] the Old Testament Joshua
[1:13:03] where listen to what he says where Moses
[1:13:05] represented the law could not save no
[1:13:09] one but Grace could and here Joshua is
[1:13:13] the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior
[1:13:18] and now then we find out that we have
[1:13:21] come to another Ephesians now brothers
[1:13:24] and sisters if you haven't caught it and
[1:13:26] you have you will because I'm going to
[1:13:28] tell you point blank
[1:13:31] there's been a second
[1:13:33] crucifixion
[1:13:35] of Jesus Christ
[1:13:38] in our generation amen therefore there
[1:13:41] has to be another resurrection
[1:13:45] and brother Branham to me represented
[1:13:48] Jesus when everybody thought he was in
[1:13:51] the Tomb laying dead he was busy working
[1:13:55] he was preaching and God was using him
[1:13:59] to manifest not the resurrected Christ
[1:14:03] the way in you and I think he didn't die
[1:14:06] twice
[1:14:09] he only needed the Bible said to
[1:14:11] sacrifice one time but because of
[1:14:14] denominationalism and religion yes
[1:14:17] and science forgive me I'm not preaching
[1:14:20] against scientists
[1:14:22] but I am preaching against the
[1:14:24] philosophy of science We Don't Preach
[1:14:27] against higher education did you all
[1:14:29] know that brother Branham never preached
[1:14:31] against like oh wait a minute brother I
[1:14:32] got 10 quotes but what you don't realize
[1:14:34] is he was preaching against the spirit
[1:14:36] that was entering into the system to
[1:14:39] begin to manipulate and massage and
[1:14:42] change the Outlook of the young mind
[1:14:45] starting at a very young age and I'll
[1:14:48] tell you when it started when did this
[1:14:50] nation turn its back on God as a nation
[1:14:54] 1956 and if you go back in your history
[1:14:58] you'll find out that there was a turn
[1:15:00] made in 1956 and it started in the
[1:15:03] school systems with the little bitty
[1:15:06] pre-case
[1:15:08] but it was such an infant so if there's
[1:15:10] a teacher in here please don't
[1:15:13] I'm not preaching against Joe I feel
[1:15:15] something I'm not preaching against you
[1:15:17] I'm wanting you to understand that
[1:15:19] politics and religion are now two horns
[1:15:24] on one hand
[1:15:26] brother Branham said that that that that
[1:15:28] that that that that that little that
[1:15:30] little creature there that represented
[1:15:31] the United States he said it started out
[1:15:33] like a lamb
[1:15:35] but it turned into a bison
[1:15:38] and I'll tell you what I know a few
[1:15:40] Cowboys and you don't Cowboy a bison
[1:15:44] he Cowboys you
[1:15:45] if he feels like running he runs if he
[1:15:49] feels like taking down the fence you
[1:15:51] can't stop him if he wants to eat over
[1:15:52] there in that pasture and he doesn't
[1:15:54] like it where you've got him he just
[1:15:56] goes
[1:15:58] don't get in his way
[1:16:00] because he'll mow you right now now do
[1:16:01] you see what's happening in politics
[1:16:03] don't get in their way
[1:16:07] no I'm not preaching to your politics
[1:16:09] but I want you to understand that same
[1:16:10] Spirit has crept in to the church and
[1:16:14] now it's coming around the message
[1:16:17] churches which which you know why you
[1:16:19] know why it's just now getting here
[1:16:20] because they realize listen now Satan's
[1:16:23] not a creator
[1:16:25] man nope that's the one thing he can't
[1:16:27] do what what's the other thing he can't
[1:16:29] bring the word word by word so I was
[1:16:34] telling brother Wade then if brother
[1:16:36] Branham and he did make both statements
[1:16:38] to me bringing the word word by word is
[1:16:44] creation
[1:16:46] there are two in that one God Amen it's
[1:16:51] creating something in you which will
[1:16:54] raise you up
[1:16:58] in the day we live in and you'll go from
[1:17:02] the barnyard
[1:17:04] to the Eagles Nest you say well brother
[1:17:06] uh I I I I I'm not I'm not I'm not in
[1:17:10] the barnyard you were at one time I can
[1:17:12] prove it I can prove by the words of the
[1:17:14] Prophet that you well you don't
[1:17:15] understand now brother I didn't come
[1:17:17] through the church
[1:17:19] watch
[1:17:20] now brother random type the Barnyard as
[1:17:22] a denominational work is that not right
[1:17:24] but you forgot the pigsty yeah I come
[1:17:28] from the pig Style
[1:17:30] that's right brother I come in and guess
[1:17:33] what the pig has to do when the call of
[1:17:35] God begins to call on him the Deep call
[1:17:39] into the deep he he's he stops Lincoln
[1:17:42] oh he still looks like a pig
[1:17:47] then the world was that how does a pig
[1:17:50] hear an eagle cry
[1:17:53] remember that same Pig has to come
[1:17:55] through the Barnyard you see that's why
[1:17:57] I see what happens in the message
[1:17:59] churches today not this when you
[1:18:01] understand I'm attacking Spirits yeah
[1:18:07] because a lot of folks come to the
[1:18:09] church so they were already in the
[1:18:11] barnyard they just didn't know whether
[1:18:13] they were a chicken or an eagle now the
[1:18:16] pig he gets a double power of
[1:18:19] transformation remember the brother that
[1:18:21] brother Branham talked to and he said
[1:18:23] now brother Bradham I don't want to die
[1:18:25] because I want to make the rapture
[1:18:27] he said you get a double blessing
[1:18:30] brother
[1:18:30] he says you get resurrected and then you
[1:18:33] go in the Rapture now the pig that was
[1:18:36] in the world he gets resurrected and
[1:18:39] then he walks through the Barnyard and
[1:18:42] here's the eagle crying on
[1:18:44] what's that what is that
[1:18:48] he was an eagle all the time
[1:18:50] he just had a pig nature that Nature's
[1:18:53] got to change
[1:18:55] it now now when you get to the Barnyard
[1:18:57] that nature changes and you think you're
[1:19:00] a chicken yeah
[1:19:02] but you're really an eagle you just
[1:19:04] don't know the difference has you have
[1:19:06] you ever noticed when when birds are
[1:19:08] hatched they're really ugly
[1:19:10] and and they've got no feathers in their
[1:19:12] heads they're all bald and they just
[1:19:13] flop around you know and their heads
[1:19:15] gets sorry you know and they can barely
[1:19:17] squeak
[1:19:19] exactly
[1:19:21] but what happens
[1:19:23] is the food chain
[1:19:26] begins to change amen metamorphosis in a
[1:19:30] way they're all just little bitty
[1:19:33] scraggly birds that can barely move and
[1:19:36] they don't know one from another but
[1:19:38] somehow over time because brother
[1:19:40] Branham said the eagle just can't eat
[1:19:42] them bucks now when he said that brother
[1:19:44] wait I'm going to tell you what came to
[1:19:45] me now brother Brown didn't say this so
[1:19:47] I want to make that clear but what came
[1:19:49] to me was there's a chick missing every
[1:19:51] once in a while
[1:19:56] you know
[1:20:00] the mother it's not a cartoon
[1:20:02] yeah five six she just says I'll lay
[1:20:05] more eggs
[1:20:06] I'll have more chicks I lay more eggs
[1:20:08] and I'll have more chicks I'll multiply
[1:20:11] I'll multiply I'll multiply I'll bring
[1:20:14] fourth after them but after a while this
[1:20:16] one bird
[1:20:18] gets twice as big as the other ones
[1:20:21] no he doesn't know he's an eagle
[1:20:24] he just looking down at the rest of the
[1:20:26] congregation going what in the world
[1:20:30] and because he's an eagle I'm telling
[1:20:31] you every once in a while a chick has to
[1:20:33] come up missing yeah
[1:20:34] I mean it's just a natural occurrences
[1:20:37] the chick has to come up missing
[1:20:39] you know and that's and you know that's
[1:20:41] like a church member right that you know
[1:20:44] if you was raised in a barnyard of a
[1:20:46] church and people go they don't want to
[1:20:48] be here no more yeah yeah come on
[1:20:52] hopefully the eagle didn't get you
[1:20:58] think about it
[1:21:00] there was very few mice around in that
[1:21:02] barnyard you know snakes didn't come
[1:21:07] strange barnyard
[1:21:08] and then after a while that eagle began
[1:21:11] to get twice as big as the mother
[1:21:14] now the mother's a chicken
[1:21:16] doesn't know any better
[1:21:18] it thinks hey look at Junior there he's
[1:21:21] going to be in the NFL
[1:21:26] huh look at him run
[1:21:29] he outstrides them all
[1:21:33] here's that eagle cry
[1:21:36] what's that
[1:21:39] see he was predestinated
[1:21:44] he was going to resurrect by
[1:21:46] representation how was he going to
[1:21:49] resurrect he's already alive so are we
[1:21:52] God's not dead he's still alive but what
[1:21:57] the devil is trying to convince us of is
[1:22:00] that he's not here
[1:22:02] and he is
[1:22:04] and if he gets here he's bound when he
[1:22:07] gets here that's what you and I do with
[1:22:09] it that's what brother random indicted
[1:22:11] the ministry for us keeping him bound so
[1:22:14] that when he gets free in the
[1:22:16] congregation that's right the people
[1:22:18] can't
[1:22:19] use it and harness it for the purpose it
[1:22:23] was intended
[1:22:26] God is good
[1:22:29] so I'll just stay with the eagle story
[1:22:31] it's it's right here in my nose but
[1:22:33] and I could read to you all the things
[1:22:34] that brother but he said some tremendous
[1:22:36] things about the eagle
[1:22:39] our brother was preaching last weekend
[1:22:41] and he quoted a quote by the way at our
[1:22:43] meetings
[1:22:45] you're gonna pick up your pen and write
[1:22:47] right now
[1:22:48] he mentioned a quote brother Branham
[1:22:51] said
[1:22:52] and I started to write down and I said
[1:22:54] well there's bald eagles
[1:22:58] I'm becoming one
[1:23:02] there's golden eagles
[1:23:05] there's Harpy eagles
[1:23:08] there's sea eagles anybody been at the
[1:23:10] ocean in Beach lately
[1:23:13] they're seals you know and you can go
[1:23:16] down the list and I think there's 17 19
[1:23:18] 15 20 different kinds of eagles and then
[1:23:21] subspecies
[1:23:24] let me tell you something about an eagle
[1:23:25] I've been fishing in Haynes Alaska yeah
[1:23:28] yeah and you catch a nice salmon and
[1:23:30] that eagle wants it yep you ain't
[1:23:32] getting it
[1:23:33] I don't care if it's on your hook yeah
[1:23:35] he takes it from you so I began to think
[1:23:39] and this brother was quoting and he
[1:23:41] quoted a quote where brother banham said
[1:23:43] true Eagles and I said look at that
[1:23:45] there's another Eagle possibility
[1:23:48] brother it ain't balding gold it ain't
[1:23:51] harpy it ain't see
[1:23:54] it doesn't eat roadkill did you all know
[1:23:56] that there are eagles that eat Roadkill
[1:23:59] ERS not every Eagle will no
[1:24:01] but there are certain families of eagles
[1:24:03] that will just take any old scrap
[1:24:06] they'll take it away
[1:24:09] they'll keep guard over it from the
[1:24:11] vultures
[1:24:14] but I found out last weekend there's an
[1:24:17] eagle
[1:24:18] that can't miss it's a true
[1:24:26] because that's what brother Branham said
[1:24:29] and that's what you are yes yes and you
[1:24:32] may not realize it but when we were in
[1:24:35] that denominational thought process
[1:24:37] which still happens today to people even
[1:24:40] sitting in message churches why I know
[1:24:42] people that become uh uh isolationists
[1:24:45] in their own church
[1:24:48] ah well who's preaching today well I
[1:24:50] don't feel like coming because I know
[1:24:54] but there might be a little piece of
[1:24:56] meat in there that you gotta have
[1:25:01] you don't know
[1:25:03] right
[1:25:05] um
[1:25:06] that's right it's getting quiet in here
[1:25:10] you need it I need it
[1:25:12] regardless of food you say well well
[1:25:15] that brother's off
[1:25:16] go anyway yeah let me tell you why
[1:25:19] because brother Branham said after that
[1:25:22] eagle began to get a little bigger and
[1:25:24] it began to develop feathers and it it
[1:25:26] still didn't know it was an eagle now
[1:25:28] and it heard that cry still didn't know
[1:25:31] it was Ingle but it whooped what was
[1:25:33] that
[1:25:35] that has a deep call and a deep response
[1:25:39] oh my goodness and he started looking
[1:25:42] around now he wasn't impuning and
[1:25:44] degrading the chickens he was only
[1:25:46] thinking about one thing he was thinking
[1:25:49] about where did that come from and the
[1:25:51] next time that eagle cried it said come
[1:25:53] on up
[1:25:57] by representation
[1:26:00] that's what the woman at the well had
[1:26:03] she didn't realize it but she was an
[1:26:05] eagle
[1:26:07] in the barnyard of humanity
[1:26:12] now watch this
[1:26:13] want to know why I tell you to leave the
[1:26:15] chickens alone
[1:26:17] you don't have to touch them
[1:26:19] you don't have to say nothing to him
[1:26:22] you just flap those wings when Mama says
[1:26:25] come up a little higher and brother
[1:26:27] Branham says where do you get the fence
[1:26:29] post but let me tell you something I
[1:26:31] grew up around farms and ranches and if
[1:26:33] an eagle or a hawk or any bird of prey
[1:26:36] gets on a fence post and he's flapping
[1:26:38] his wings the chickens are running for
[1:26:39] cover
[1:26:40] because they see the shadow of a bird of
[1:26:43] prey and that's an instinct go
[1:26:46] then you find yourself all by yourself
[1:26:48] on the fence post I gotta find a church
[1:26:50] see what happened to me in the world is
[1:26:53] I wasn't happy on the inside and I
[1:26:55] wanted to find a piece and I didn't know
[1:26:58] God I didn't know Jesus Christ but I
[1:27:01] wanted to find peace and contentment and
[1:27:03] reality and and and and all the things
[1:27:05] that we desire
[1:27:09] if
[1:27:10] he knew what he was doing brother Wade
[1:27:13] I didn't realize that was when I was up
[1:27:16] on the fence post I hadn't gone to
[1:27:17] church yet I was up on the fence post
[1:27:19] and all my worldly friends
[1:27:22] disappeared didn't want to be around me
[1:27:24] no more why because I'd be preaching to
[1:27:26] him I remember the first week I got
[1:27:28] saved I found out about the cloud and
[1:27:30] the Life Magazine I went down to the
[1:27:33] local Auction Yard and got three or four
[1:27:35] magazines for 25 cents a piece back then
[1:27:37] it was a long time ago I've been doing
[1:27:39] this 45 years
[1:27:41] and then I'm witnessing to one of my
[1:27:43] best friends in his bedroom we were
[1:27:46] Motocross Racing buddies I'm sitting on
[1:27:48] the foot of his bed by the way there's a
[1:27:50] bookshelf across with me and I'm
[1:27:51] preaching to him I'm telling them a God
[1:27:53] sent a prophet and that there was a
[1:27:55] cloud and that you know I was immature
[1:27:57] but I was an eagle I just wow wow I was
[1:28:00] just going off
[1:28:02] thinking everybody was going to hear it
[1:28:04] I didn't know
[1:28:07] and I'm just going at it with him and
[1:28:09] he's like wow yeah well um yeah wow
[1:28:12] but brother Wade right there as I was
[1:28:15] testifying to him about God sending a
[1:28:18] cloud in 1963 lo and behold God is my
[1:28:22] witness right on his bookshelf was a
[1:28:24] Britannica encyclopedia
[1:28:27] 64-year book which in it has the picture
[1:28:30] of the cloud for
[1:28:32] 1963. I whooped that thing off there and
[1:28:35] I opened it up and I said there it is
[1:28:37] right there and he was like
[1:28:40] you must have known that was there
[1:28:42] I said I had no idea I'd heard that it
[1:28:46] was in one of the encyclopedias a
[1:28:49] yearbook he he had it on his Shelf
[1:28:55] the next week he moved yeah
[1:28:58] yeah he moved he moved out to San Luis
[1:29:00] Obispo
[1:29:02] from the from the mainlander the center
[1:29:04] of California where I lived
[1:29:06] but I didn't know I thought wow man I
[1:29:09] thought everybody would accept this
[1:29:11] because I thought everybody I guess was
[1:29:12] an eagle I didn't realize that I was
[1:29:15] walking with the chickens
[1:29:17] and the pigs and the Pigs die yeah
[1:29:21] see how God operates brothers and
[1:29:23] sisters what you don't realize is that
[1:29:26] if you were in him
[1:29:29] you're still there yes
[1:29:31] yes he don't lose one
[1:29:34] all that the father has given me will
[1:29:37] come to me and I won't lose one the
[1:29:41] devil can't snatch one from me
[1:29:44] that's what the resurrection means to me
[1:29:46] I wasn't there 2 000 years ago but he's
[1:29:50] here today the resurrected Christ is now
[1:29:54] living in US
[1:29:56] I caught something last week as the
[1:29:58] brother was preaching and we got a
[1:29:59] picture of the pillar of fire up there
[1:30:01] and he gets the picture off the wall and
[1:30:02] he begins to show and he's talking about
[1:30:04] how that how that this Pillar of Fire
[1:30:06] speaks
[1:30:07] hmm yeah what speaks
[1:30:10] spoke to Moses
[1:30:12] then he began to preach on how this same
[1:30:14] Pillar of Fire on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:16] broke off from himself but it never
[1:30:18] diminished like the fishes in the loaves
[1:30:19] it was still the same size and the same
[1:30:22] Pillar of Fire why they had leftovers
[1:30:24] with the fishes and the lows can I take
[1:30:26] my coat off I'm going to preach a little
[1:30:27] bit
[1:30:28] okay
[1:30:32] look at that
[1:30:34] thank you
[1:30:37] and it come to me
[1:30:39] it should come to you
[1:30:42] that Pillar of Fire was in that burning
[1:30:44] bush
[1:30:45] that pill or fire was in the photograph
[1:30:48] y I believe that Pillar of Fire was in
[1:30:49] the hearts of every believer starting
[1:30:52] from the day of Pentecost so guess what
[1:30:55] brother that makes us a burning bush
[1:30:59] there's an attraction on the mountain
[1:31:02] they just don't know what it is but if
[1:31:04] they turn aside
[1:31:07] and they Wonder hey what happened to you
[1:31:09] brother I haven't seen you in years well
[1:31:11] you got time
[1:31:13] sit down
[1:31:15] let me tell you how this works there is
[1:31:19] a pillar of fire burning in my heart
[1:31:21] named Jesus Christ Jesus Christ he was a
[1:31:24] man two thousand years ago oh but when
[1:31:26] Paul met him
[1:31:28] they all met him yeah and he went back
[1:31:31] Amen to God is that right he said he
[1:31:34] came from God and he went back to God
[1:31:36] and the prophet of God says you and I
[1:31:38] have the same life in us so not if we
[1:31:43] came from God but because we came from
[1:31:47] God we're going back to God but we've
[1:31:50] always been a part of God you say well
[1:31:54] brother I can read to you quotes where
[1:31:55] brother Branham says there ain't nothing
[1:31:57] good in us I got those same quotes I
[1:31:59] want to ask you a question who are you
[1:32:02] brother Branham said you don't see me
[1:32:05] this ain't me
[1:32:08] there's a man in here yes who can turn
[1:32:11] on the light there's a man in here who
[1:32:14] turns water to wine walks on the water
[1:32:17] and gives sight to the blind he gave
[1:32:19] back life
[1:32:21] to the ones that's daddy fed for a
[1:32:23] thousand with seven loaves of bread yep
[1:32:25] do you believe that yeah that's the
[1:32:27] resurrected Christ today brothers and
[1:32:30] sisters he didn't die on Calvary so
[1:32:32] people could nail themselves to the
[1:32:34] Cross every Easter no
[1:32:36] died on Calvary so that the life that he
[1:32:40] lived can come back and be imparted into
[1:32:42] each and every one of you and I and what
[1:32:46] would it do to us it would transform us
[1:32:50] there's a question in question I'm off
[1:32:53] my notes now there's a question and
[1:32:55] questions and answers that somebody
[1:32:56] asked brother Bradham if they'll explain
[1:32:58] the translation
[1:33:01] brother Bradham does not mention Enoch
[1:33:03] nope
[1:33:05] he says let me tell you about Abraham
[1:33:08] and he begins to talk about Abraham and
[1:33:11] his journey and that Journey that
[1:33:13] Abraham took which you and I are on
[1:33:15] tonight began to turn Abraham from an
[1:33:18] old man who was dried up
[1:33:21] into a young man who could produce
[1:33:24] children now the church was a little
[1:33:26] behind him
[1:33:28] now watch we don't know whether the
[1:33:31] church Sarah had gotten the Revelation
[1:33:33] at the same time that uh that that the
[1:33:37] transformation at the same time that
[1:33:39] Abraham did because she wouldn't
[1:33:43] participate
[1:33:44] she said I gotta uh uh
[1:33:47] Hagar here I got an idea see what's
[1:33:50] wrong see what happens with the church I
[1:33:52] got this idea lay them ideas down would
[1:33:55] you
[1:33:56] like throw them in the garbage can
[1:33:59] take God and God alone
[1:34:01] and once you get him brothers and
[1:34:04] sisters you'll find out he's not
[1:34:06] entombed
[1:34:08] that's not a gloomy day outside
[1:34:11] that's the same spirit that falls on the
[1:34:13] just and the unjust and we live by it
[1:34:17] you say but there's too much rain I'll
[1:34:19] tell you there's too much snow you don't
[1:34:21] have to shovel rain you come to my house
[1:34:23] and you'll be shoveling snow
[1:34:29] you don't believe me listen to what the
[1:34:31] prophet says
[1:34:33] I got it I got it here I'm just going to
[1:34:36] stay off my notes and stop pretty quick
[1:34:38] thank you but you know what it's getting
[1:34:41] hot in here I can tell
[1:34:43] listen to this
[1:34:45] I got trials tribulations and tests

[1:34:53] amen I'm gonna finish that my redeemer
[1:34:56] liveth but it's I know
[1:34:59] the date there 419 of 60.
[1:35:07] this is what the prophet of God said
[1:35:09] think about it we ask
[1:35:11] for comfort
[1:35:13] and peace
[1:35:15] there I was
[1:35:17] kingford still asking for comfort and
[1:35:20] peace but my peace and comfort now come
[1:35:23] from within yeah
[1:35:26] because there's a resurrected Christ and
[1:35:30] inside of us that means that we are able
[1:35:33] to do and perform all of those signs
[1:35:36] wonders and miracles that he did he said
[1:35:39] if you believe me these signs shall
[1:35:42] follow you
[1:35:44] people are so oh

[1:35:54] could get and the chickens are running
[1:35:56] amen you haven't even flown yet
[1:35:59] you did what a turkey does when he wants
[1:36:01] to roost

[1:36:09] and she keeps calling that word keeps
[1:36:12] talking to you that Revelation keeps
[1:36:15] coming it's spiritual food and new
[1:36:16] season
[1:36:18] it keeps feeding it keeps building faith
[1:36:21] muscles it keeps building spiritual
[1:36:24] bodies
[1:36:29] we ask for comfort and peace God gives
[1:36:32] us the best he could give us what is it
[1:36:36] the next sin says trials
[1:36:39] and tribulation
[1:36:41] oh right away people go I don't want to
[1:36:43] serve that God yeah
[1:36:46] oh and your life is any better yeah
[1:36:50] see what happens is if we recognize that
[1:36:53] he gives us his best through trials and
[1:36:56] tribulations we become real genuine amen
[1:37:00] God born God felt god-builded God
[1:37:06] begotten
[1:37:07] children of God that's our goal not
[1:37:10] everybody wants to do that most people
[1:37:13] want to hang around here for a while and
[1:37:15] save some more money and convert their
[1:37:16] cash into gold and okay it's not going
[1:37:19] to help you you want to know why
[1:37:22] you can accumulate and amass as much
[1:37:24] riches as you want you can have a food
[1:37:26] shelter you can have gold piled up in
[1:37:27] your safe and guess who's showing up if

[1:37:55] according to what the prophet said
[1:37:56] bullets will bounce right off you
[1:37:58] and if they don't brother Tom they'll
[1:38:00] you'll go home is that right that's what
[1:38:02] you that's what he was testifying
[1:38:04] God don't lose a one who in the world
[1:38:08] wants to stick around here do you think
[1:38:10] it's going to get better come on it's
[1:38:13] snowballing yeah it's an avalanche of
[1:38:16] sin and unbelief and craziness
[1:38:20] but do you want peace and contentment
[1:38:22] and comfort
[1:38:23] trial and tribulation is coming your way
[1:38:26] but God Made You to withstand every one
[1:38:31] of them by his life being placed in you
[1:38:37] and to finish about representation now
[1:38:41] brother Branham explain to us the
[1:38:43] translation of the Bride
[1:38:46] okay I will let me use Abraham as an
[1:38:48] example
[1:38:50] he talks about Abraham in the journey
[1:38:52] you're on it
[1:38:55] and that journey is transforming you
[1:38:59] by hearing the word of God and it alone
[1:39:05] and brother Branham says that word that
[1:39:08] you're taking in begins to start to form
[1:39:12] a body
[1:39:14] and that body begins to form on the
[1:39:16] inside of you
[1:39:18] and if you keep taking in the word if
[1:39:21] you keep bringing in the eagle food you
[1:39:24] will see the resurrected Christ in your
[1:39:27] very own life then you won't care what
[1:39:32] comes or goes you won't care what the
[1:39:36] government's doing or the banks are
[1:39:38] failing or even if your car is broke
[1:39:40] down brother or cars in your case
[1:39:46] because he's given you his best
[1:39:50] he's forming a character
[1:39:52] by the building of that body inside of
[1:39:55] you
[1:39:57] and brother Branham says this in closing
[1:40:01] did you know the resurrection Lays
[1:40:03] in you
[1:40:06] now we know that what the scripture
[1:40:08] means they without us
[1:40:12] I'm telling you those folks that have
[1:40:14] gone on before us you may not realize it
[1:40:17] but they're rooting they're pulling
[1:40:19] they're shouting now there is a half
[1:40:22] hour of Silence
[1:40:26] in everybody's life that's right
[1:40:29] because you begin to look at yourself
[1:40:31] and brother Branham said that's seventh
[1:40:32] seal they were oh
[1:40:37] it was pretty awesome man
[1:40:39] when you come to the real genuine
[1:40:41] Revelation that God the Eternal God the
[1:40:45] god that ha don't try to figure this out
[1:40:47] you'll become Einstein what I didn't
[1:40:50] tell you about Einstein if you ever
[1:40:51] watch any of documentaries on him he
[1:40:54] spent the last years of his life laying
[1:40:57] in bed with chalkboards in front of him
[1:40:59] trying to figure out how to change that
[1:41:02] equation into a final answer
[1:41:08] he didn't realize all the time that the
[1:41:09] James Webb super telescope was going to
[1:41:12] go out and look for it
[1:41:13] because he mentioned Hubble
[1:41:15] so they got the idea that telescope is
[1:41:17] one million miles out there and it's got
[1:41:20] these big wings
[1:41:22] that fold out and they're reflective
[1:41:25] mirrors and they're and they're sending
[1:41:27] and wanting to receive signals guess
[1:41:30] what the mirrors are made out of does
[1:41:31] anybody know
[1:41:32] it's gold thank you
[1:41:35] and the way they explained it when I was
[1:41:37] hearing the documentary on it I know
[1:41:39] this sounds crazy but the guy took his
[1:41:42] wedding band off and he laid it on the
[1:41:43] table and he said there's about five six
[1:41:46] or seven of those wedding bands and
[1:41:48] those giant mirrors that are yards and
[1:41:50] yards and yards wide yeah yeah it was
[1:41:53] funny that he used a wedding band and
[1:41:55] that it's gold gold is the most
[1:41:57] conductive and reflective substance that
[1:41:59] we know of
[1:42:01] but it has to be beaten out
[1:42:04] so thin
[1:42:05] that you can see through it
[1:42:08] and it reflects like a mirror
[1:42:11] guess what they're looking for they're
[1:42:13] looking for the same thing that Einstein
[1:42:14] and Hubble and all the rest of the
[1:42:16] astronomers in Galileo and everybody was
[1:42:17] looking for
[1:42:18] they were looking for the god
[1:42:21] that's in you we could have saved them
[1:42:24] trillions and trillions and trillions of
[1:42:28] dollars and and and tens of twenties of
[1:42:31] years and said he's here
[1:42:32] quit wasting your time and your money
[1:42:37] but you know what
[1:42:38] I heard brother Dutch say this
[1:42:41] that the astronomers astrologers
[1:42:44] mathematicians scientists philosophers
[1:42:48] etc etc
[1:42:50] won't admit
[1:42:52] it's Jesus Christ
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:54] it won't admit it
[1:42:56] they believe in a higher being they just
[1:42:59] don't want anybody to know that because
[1:43:02] then they don't need to teach anybody
[1:43:04] anything
[1:43:06] is that right
[1:43:08] it's exactly right
[1:43:10] you love him
[1:43:12] yeah it's a bodybuilding
[1:43:15] inside of you yeah
[1:43:17] guess what it started with the same
[1:43:20] Pillar of Fire that built the body 2 000
[1:43:23] years ago to walk this Earth 33 and a
[1:43:27] half years and hang on the cross for you
[1:43:31] and me so that we can become
[1:43:34] joint heirs
[1:43:36] with it

[1:43:44] praise the Lord

[1:46:36] my sins are gone
[1:46:39] hey man do you believe that though do
[1:46:43] you believe that you know he threw them
[1:46:46] in the sea of his own forgetfulness
[1:46:50] backwards
[1:46:53] where we can't go
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:56] he threw him in the sea putting no
[1:46:59] fishing sign up I said don't go there no
[1:47:02] more
[1:47:04] but what do we do brother Tom we take a
[1:47:07] fishing pole we throw it out there and
[1:47:08] we bring them back out or we try to
[1:47:12] give him another hand that was good
[1:47:18] brother
[1:47:20] brother Chris can pour his heart out
[1:47:22] quicker than anybody I've ever seen it
[1:47:23] took me two and a half hours to say what
[1:47:25] he said
[1:47:27] yeah I know you can
[1:47:29] you can do it tomorrow
[1:47:32] but we appreciate the Lord and the
[1:47:35] Ministries that we hear the ministers uh
[1:47:38] the different ways of of of you know
[1:47:40] there's different ways to get to Atlanta
[1:47:42] you know and you got five folds of it
[1:47:45] there's a map that you that's folded up
[1:47:48] by the time that fold is five-fold if
[1:47:50] you unfold one fold you might could get
[1:47:52] 20 miles down the road
[1:47:55] you fun fold it again you might get 20
[1:47:57] more miles down the road but you'll
[1:47:58] never get to your destination until you
[1:47:59] file and take all five folds and open
[1:48:01] them up and let the fivefold ministry
[1:48:04] help us that's why we believe in a
[1:48:06] powerful Ministry we don't believe in a
[1:48:08] one-fold we believe in a five-fold
[1:48:09] Ministry that will pour their heart out
[1:48:12] and the only way you're going to get it
[1:48:13] and I'm going to get it is that way
[1:48:16] we can press play all we want to but I
[1:48:18] promise you you will not get perfected
[1:48:20] the Bible says without a five-fold
[1:48:22] minister amen can't do it according to
[1:48:26] the Bible to be perfected you got to
[1:48:28] listen to a man and you know what
[1:48:29] brother around me said that's the
[1:48:30] hardest thing for one man to do is
[1:48:32] believe another man well you know what I
[1:48:34] don't believe brother Chris
[1:48:37] I believe that God is in him that just
[1:48:39] spoke to us through that human vessel
[1:48:42] now that way I do believe brother Chris
[1:48:43] hey man
[1:48:45] now we're going to go eat a bite of
[1:48:48] natural food now we appreciate all of
[1:48:51] you coming
[1:48:52] we thank brother Chris again for pouring
[1:48:54] his heart out there's so many nuggets
[1:48:56] and I want to tell you if you weren't
[1:48:57] here last night you almost missed the
[1:49:00] Rapture
[1:49:02] that's why I'm telling you y'all miss
[1:49:04] church and you think boys that ain't
[1:49:06] nothing just another you missed a
[1:49:08] visitation of God last night from God
[1:49:10] not from some man you've missed a
[1:49:12] visitation brother Dutch Scott preached
[1:49:15] a masterpiece so I'll adjure you if you
[1:49:18] have not heard that or watched it that's
[1:49:19] why we put it online so you can watch it
[1:49:22] you need to watch that I'm gonna go back
[1:49:24] and watch it myself again
[1:49:26] because I'm telling you it was full of
[1:49:28] nuggets he almost two hours that man
[1:49:31] priest it didn't seem like 15 minutes
[1:49:34] when somebody's saying something
[1:49:37] you slide off into eternity
[1:49:40] and you listen to the Eternal Word of
[1:49:42] God
[1:49:43] and it just keeps going on and keeps
[1:49:45] going on and keeps going on we sure
[1:49:48] appreciate the five full ministry we
[1:49:49] appreciate everyone brother Tom and all
[1:49:51] the different ones too the ministry we
[1:49:53] have here we sure do appreciate we we
[1:49:54] need to bind together
[1:49:56] hey man you realize today is what the
[1:49:59] seventh day right
[1:50:01] today's the seventh day today's Saturday
[1:50:03] and you know what
[1:50:06] Jesus is not on the Earth
[1:50:08] two thousand years ago he's silent
[1:50:14] the Bible says silence in heaven
[1:50:17] for the space of half an hour he wasn't
[1:50:20] up there
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:22] he was down preaching to the souls in
[1:50:24] prison right but you know what he was
[1:50:27] doing he was doing what we've been
[1:50:30] preaching
[1:50:31] every sermon millions of sermons for
[1:50:33] 2000 years that's what he was doing
[1:50:35] during that time of Silence there was
[1:50:37] nothing going on
[1:50:38] and then up from the grave he arose amen
[1:50:42] and he didn't rise for himself
[1:50:44] he rose for me and you
[1:50:46] I want you to understand that he did not
[1:50:49] come up for himself he didn't come up
[1:50:50] and get Glory of his own self he came up
[1:50:52] to get glory to give it to you
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:54] he walked out of that tomb as brother
[1:50:56] Dutch said he walked out of that tomb
[1:50:58] and those feet that had nail prints on
[1:51:00] them
[1:51:01] he said I don't think he was down there
[1:51:03] in Hell tiptoeing he went
[1:51:05] Hallelujah
[1:51:07] he wanted the devil to know
[1:51:10] he was the mighty conqueror even with
[1:51:13] nail prints in his feet in his hands
[1:51:16] he was a mighty conqueror looked like a
[1:51:19] bad day like today like like brother
[1:51:20] Dutch was talking about the sermon was
[1:51:22] Good Friday it didn't look very good if
[1:51:24] you look from the outside it didn't look
[1:51:26] very good very dark moon
[1:51:29] lost its life all the stars
[1:51:33] lost their life there was no light it
[1:51:36] was the darkest day that ever was to a
[1:51:38] to man but not to a Christian we know
[1:51:43] that had to be the part of the play and
[1:51:45] the plan that we've been talking about
[1:51:46] the Plan of Redemption that was a plan
[1:51:48] God had and that was per that was part
[1:51:50] of that plan and today we have seen part
[1:51:54] of that plan being given to each one of
[1:51:57] us and we appreciate uh brother Chris
[1:52:00] again and sister Joanna for coming and
[1:52:03] we love them with the love of the Lord
[1:52:04] and love all of you with the love of the
[1:52:06] Lord and we wish you'd stay around and
[1:52:07] eat
[1:52:08] um it's just going to rain on you if you
[1:52:10] go outside so I appreciate brother Tom
[1:52:13] and his family coming and then we want
[1:52:14] to try to get to maybe get a fellowship
[1:52:16] meeting back into the summertime
[1:52:18] sometime for the Tony and different ones
[1:52:20] that they would they'd try to we try to
[1:52:22] get it back together but I miss the
[1:52:23] fellowship meetings I really do I miss
[1:52:25] the fellowship meetings because it's a
[1:52:27] fellowship we come to fellowship with
[1:52:28] each other and and do his brother Tom
[1:52:30] said he'd come up here and he gave us a
[1:52:32] little snippet of what was going on in
[1:52:35] his mind
[1:52:36] because usually a minister when he comes
[1:52:38] up here I hope he speaks his mind
[1:52:40] right he gave us a little snippet of
[1:52:43] what's been going on and you think well
[1:52:44] that was just five minutes to me it's an
[1:52:46] eternity
[1:52:47] of what's going on and what's happening
[1:52:49] and what's going on in the world and the
[1:52:51] different things each one of us we bring
[1:52:53] it all together and it's a big story
[1:52:55] it's a big picture and it's not a story
[1:52:56] that's a story like a fiction it's
[1:52:59] non-fiction the what we what we speak is
[1:53:02] non-fiction amen
[1:53:04] and with Einstein you know Einstein came
[1:53:07] on the Earth
[1:53:08] the greatest mind
[1:53:10] that ever was produced by human
[1:53:15] you understand what I'm saying the
[1:53:17] greatest mind that was ever produced by
[1:53:19] a man and a woman to human beings
[1:53:21] but thank God
[1:53:23] you and I we might have missed that we
[1:53:26] can't sit down and listen to Einstein
[1:53:28] break down the theory of relativity but
[1:53:32] we had a spiritual Einstein
[1:53:35] that came from a mother and father
[1:53:37] called Branham
[1:53:39] but he caught the mind of God and he was
[1:53:41] a spiritual Einstein I believe if you'd
[1:53:44] have got that natural Einstein and
[1:53:46] brother ran them together they might
[1:53:48] have been something went on
[1:53:50] it would have been a happening because
[1:53:52] they would have sat there and fed off of
[1:53:54] each other but thank God they didn't
[1:53:55] because they gave it to us but I like
[1:53:57] what we were talking about this uh
[1:53:59] yesterday brother Chris was talking
[1:54:00] about going forward you know you take
[1:54:03] and if you look at what Einstein is
[1:54:06] teaching was that if you could look
[1:54:09] through Infinity if you could look you
[1:54:11] know obviously it's in a curve
[1:54:13] all right but what did he say he said if
[1:54:15] man could look with infinite eyesight
[1:54:17] what would you see
[1:54:18] he said you see the back of your head
[1:54:22] there's you there's your new body
[1:54:26] he just didn't know what to call it
[1:54:29] Einstein just said you see the back of
[1:54:30] your head no we see the new body because
[1:54:33] that's our Eternal that we step into
[1:54:34] it's just a curve and we jump in and
[1:54:37] take off all right visitors go first
[1:54:41] um we'll pray over the food here for
[1:54:43] those of you that go to church here next

[1:54:47] be next Sunday and we're gonna have a

[1:55:22] just believe that I just believe that
[1:55:24] we're as brother Chris we were talking
[1:55:26] about I believe you know it says uh a
[1:55:28] true eagle
[1:55:30] I believe we're in the true part
[1:55:33] we're not just an eagle we're true
[1:55:35] Eagles and and that doesn't make us
[1:55:37] big-headed and separate ourselves let
[1:55:39] God separate us yes right God you want
[1:55:42] it does it anyway God will separate us
[1:55:43] from the world I promise you that we'll
[1:55:45] not be chickens unless you are a chicken
