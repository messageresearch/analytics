is the lord amen amen you have your bibles turn with me to revelations chapter three stand for the reading of the word i thought maybe tonight and maybe brother joe he didn't pressure me but he thought well maybe you know if you didn't have anything else you should think about this so well it just seemed it seemed like i could be good it's what the lord would have for us but um as as many of you may know you maybe have the book on your shelf um uh about oh five or six years ago i started i had always wanted to write a curriculum using the church age book is the textbook so you would read the church age book and then you could answer questions and activities or whatever and maybe just a little bit of a explanation and you get an assignment how many pages you should read and this is one of the first churches that bought uh those books that i completed what i what i had really originally started doing was i was teaching sunday school to the teenage class at the branham tabernacle and i thought okay i had taught my way through genesis and i thought well i'm going to teach my way through revelations now and um so that's pretty much church ages right there first three chapters so i thought well we'll start here and i've always wanted to do this so what i'm going to do is i'm going to write my lessons for my students in such a way that hopefully when i'm done i can just grab all these lessons and throw them in a book and everybody else can can benefit and the book can sit on people's shelves and they can leave them on the shelves and never actually do the lessons but i'm not bitter but anyway but my intention was that people would read the church age book because it changed my life i it it helped me in my walk with the lord i after i read the church age book i found myself sitting there as i was reading going oh yeah that's why i believe that like i i i how did i knew that but i certainly couldn't have explained it but now at least i've read somebody that did explain why i believe that like it makes sense to me now and and it just really changed my understanding and it changed my walk so i really want everyone to experience that and so but i recognize that you know um you get the church age book and some of us aren't really great readers i like to read but i'm i'm weird i guess but you know it's this thick it's 350 some pages i think it is or something like that and some people look at that and then they see big words like gloss alia and they go and not reading that book and and so i figured well what we need to do is we need to we need to do it just like you'd eat an elephant does anybody know how you eat an elephant one bite at a time so well can you read five pages okay here's a lesson where you read five pages or ten pages can you do that yeah okay we'll just do that 75 times over the next year two years whatever and then you will have read the church age book so that's really what i had tried to do i'm now in the process of of recording video lessons just like a sunday school lesson for each um chapter each lesson that if you you guys are are good here you got plenty of people who can teach and things like that but if there were a church that needed you know maybe didn't have a teacher that was qualified for a teenage class they could take this and try to keep it below 30 minutes so teacher can do some introductions hit the video and you know there's your lesson and okay here's your here's you got your books and so go home and read your lesson and answer the questions and we'll come back on the next one so that's that's the plan that's what what i'm working on but i just thought maybe it's kind of neat you guys you guys bought these books and so i thought well maybe it'd be cool to have to just do a lesson together and so this is i just finished this is the last lesson i preached at our church because we've been going through uh as a church together well the six of us have but the whole church is going through it it's just six people are actually doing the lessons but don't worry that doesn't hurt an author or anything like that but but for all that work and tears and anyway you should just read the church age book amen so anyway i thought well how nice this would this would kind of be we could he's about to hand me some hankies so i first thought well we can we can um we can go through a lesson this would be the introduction to the philadelphian church age i thought it was a good lesson when we when we did it at the at the church and i know you guys have been um going through the revelation series um and many of the quotes are out of um the philadelphia church age on this lesson usually i take them out of the church age book this one i just particularly want to happen to take them mostly out of the message when he preached it but anyway you're standing we should read the scripture and then i'll let you sit so revelations chapter 3 verses 7 through 13 is the is the word to the philadelphian age unto the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shouteth in no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength has kept my word and has not denied my name behold i will make of them i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee that's a scripture because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of the heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord we come as we just approach this lesson lord and i don't know maybe how exactly this will go um but lord we just want to give the evening to you we want to enjoy the fellowship of the brethren sisters together like precious faith lord with the word that you've given to us lord how pure and holy this is that we can come together and just look upon these things father so anoint us to hear anoint me to speak lord and may we enjoy this lesson lord as you've as you've given it lord and may we learn from it may we grow may we be challenged and strengthened um lord as i just tell a few things and testimony out of my life to add to this lord i just i pray that it'd be a blessing to the people so father we give all things to you we love you and we we lay our hearts before you and yield to you would you come now we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated so everyone's favorite part of of every church age lesson is the memorization section um and we we what we do because this is just how i feel like people learn is we recite together the memorization section because if you want to recite something now you know you just look you don't have to sit there and cram like what you do is over a short you know significant period of time whether that be months or weeks or whatever if you were to just you know recite something out loud like three times every day you'd have it memorized in short order really wouldn't take that long so you don't have it's not hard to memorize something it's just a little faithfulness for a lengthy period of time and it really goes a long way my my kids when they were young ish i don't know what was it ten and eight or something like the boys were ten and eight probably i think something like that eleven nine something like that um i don't know i was one of those parents that just had grand ideas for their children and you know we had a homeschool group and i i don't know maybe he's part of a little parent pride i don't know probably a lot of that but um we started we started memorizing hebrews chapter 11. so my 11 year old boy and my nine-year-old boy memorized the entirety of hebrews chapter 11. now it had been my original intention that i could just be like hey zion what's verse 16 and expect him to just quote that exactly what verse 16 was we never got that far but they could go they could start at one and get through 40 or how many other verses there are you know and then and then we had a homeschool play thing and so i was like well these guys have already memorized this let's just make a play out of hebrews chapter 11. so they would quote a couple verses and then you know act out a little clip out of each thing so all that to say you know an 11 and 9 year old can memorize hebrews chapter 11 because we just work on it like every night for three months it wasn't that hard it was just every night for three months we didn't spend two hours it was like 20 minutes a night for three months they had it memorized so this is how you learn it's not that hard so let's recite together this is this is me teaching now okay so i was a little more preachy this morning now i'll probably get a little preachy tonight too but we're teaching right now so we memorize together or we recite together there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in christ everything fades into insignificance beside him the poetry that's in the church age book is at times unmatched this is worth memorizing the sum total of all perfection is in christ and everything fades into insignificance plus i like man a brother can preach on that for a good long while that's worth memorizing so each section um in the in a in a book that you have uh each each chapter has a memorization section and if you just were to apply yourself a little bit you'd have these nuggets like this memorized and guess what happens when you have a nugget like this memorized well well you can quote it brother trevor yeah but you can quote it to the devil you can quote it to your friends you can quote it to somebody you're witnessing to the devil might come and attack you and you can remind yourself there's a there's a lot of benefits to hiding the word of god in your heart so so that's why i chose little selections out of each chapter to go through so anyhow so we're going to go into the introduction to philadelphia the philadelphian church age the introduction will encompass the city the age and the messenger so focusing here then on revelations chapter 3 and verse 7 a to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy so we just what we do is what brother branham does in the church age book is just break it down phrase by phrase i don't know if you caught that before but he's just breaking it down phrase by phrase so if you read through the whole you know the whole letter to that church you go man there's a lot of stuff i don't understand well you read the church age book and brother branham explains every single clause every single phrase you know it's great it's just good to be a christian it's good to be a message believer we have so much at our disposal but first before we go into the into this introduction because we're so far into this and we're now on chapter let's hear philadelphia's chapter uh eight um we and and would be the sixth church age we would have to list the first five church ages in order does anybody want to take a stab at what you've learned and i know you haven't been having the benefit of me teaching but maybe just maybe somebody has memorized the seven church ages in order does anybody want to take a stab at that now in our church we had a 10 year old boy embarrass all the adults so anybody not my kids that's not fair they were the test subjects they did it as a homeschool curriculum which you know if you have if you homeschool and you have high school age kids like you could you could do it brother did you want to do were you was that no okay all right so we're going to do ephesus smyrna pergamos thyatira sardis then now we're on philadelphia and then of course laodicea will come and then does anybody want to take a stab at the first five church age messengers in order paul irenaeus martin columba luther then what that's not you all can't read you all can't read that though that's too like can you read that all right and then i gave bonus points out for anybody that could tell me the years the first five church ages in order but with years ephesus 53 to 170 oh brother i'm getting brother wade now yeah 53 to 170 smyrna 170 to 312 pergamos 312 to 606. thyatira 606 to 1520 stardust 1520 to 1750. i could probably do that but i have a cheat sheet in front of me so i didn't because that's embarrassing when you mess up in front of people and then we go through the first this is all things that you would be encouraged to memorize if you were going through this this book um and the first first five church ages meanings in order what ephesus means it means aimed at or relaxed or aimed at and then relaxed and then smyrna bitterness pergamus thoroughly married thyatira dominating female or laxed loose lazy sardis escaped ones and philadelphia well we haven't learned that yet so we won't get there bodily love of course and so so then we go into the age and we begin to look at the conditions of the age i need to do maybe a little bit of background but well we'll do that here on this map um this map you know you just this map i show every at the introduction to every age and the reason i show this map is this is a this is a scale drawing from google earth brother branham says that the area in the um asia minor here was either the size of indiana which is this or the size about the size of pennsylvania so that gives you a little bit of scale it took me like four hours to do this map i bring it up every age so i never want to spend four hours doing something that like that again so everybody just gets to look at this map because it took a long time and i just need to get mileage out of that to make it worth it it's a personal thing so but then what we one of the things that we we would have already discussed in the intro to the ages is we see we have ephesus smyrna pergamos thyotaro sardis philadelphia laodicea and we know that those are the ages but then wait what are these other little guys why are they there like there's lycia pamphylia lystra iconium derby antioch all of these other samoa theories all these other places paul went there there were churches there were christians there why these seven why these seven and what you would have learned and what we we just background really quick is that is that those seven were chosen because the characteristics of the city match the characteristics of the age that was to come so what was going on in the city was what was going to be going on in that age and the typing there different things that brother branham would bring out of that city and then what we're going to learn today is about the coin that was that was the money that they were they used in philadelphia and how that typed that that philadelphian age and what was going on spiritually during that age so that's why there's these seven are chosen there's many other christian churches but these seven are chosen for a specific reason it's the characteristics of the age so then we just go on to our timeline and as we looked as we talked you know through the ages and how many years and all of that and why do i why do i bring this up why do i show you a timeline well you're here you're right here well if you're right here what does that mean for here all right all right you're on this timeline this timeline's reality this isn't story this isn't some fictitious thing that happened in long time ago and on land far far away you know whatever it was no this is reality this happened on this earth things that happened through these ages happen to people like you and i on this earth just over there in in asia minor or perhaps as we talk spiritually through the age around the world so so these things happen you're connected to it this is history not story all right so so that's why i always want to bring this up and so now we're going to be talking about an age very very close to one right before where we lived and so you know they had horse-drawn carriages back then stuff like that you know like you know not too far away okay that was a really long time away but you know i don't know but i just want you to you know connect yourself here recognize this isn't this isn't this isn't fiction this happened that in 80 95 and 96 john is on patmos getting uh getting having a vision of these things writing them down as the lord told him to and then now as we read in the scripture there would come malachi 4 5 and 6 revelations 10 7 to restore the faith and guess what it actually happened and now that that messenger can can show us exactly what was already written down in 95 96 but was hidden was written in symbol form so a prophet could come so that people all through these ages wouldn't wouldn't think like oh jesus is coming tomorrow well we wanted them to think jesus come tomorrow live like jesus is coming tomorrow but there was going to come an age when you actually knew and had the revelation that hey man these people it was going to be a thousand years for them maybe they didn't know it but they knew they were to live as jesus was coming tomorrow and so so then he begins to to show the history and how this history absolutely types the characteristics that was baked into each age into the word of god in symbol form for us man that's incredible and people stay atheists somehow i don't get it because i look at that and think that is the most amazing un like the you talking about the author of all authors that can that can throw twists and turns in that you don't see coming and you read it the first time and you're like wow that was amazing didn't see that and you read it the second time and there's twists and turns you didn't see coming still and you read it a third time and you find out more why because the unchanging god just gets deeper and bigger the more you learn about him as we said this morning and so you know you read i don't know what what books you might read but you you you you know name your favorite novel you read it the second time and it's not as good as the first time the bible gets better the more time more times you read it it's the only book that's the only book that gets better every time you read it any other book you're just like i heard i know this story like i get it like i it's you know oh yeah you know at the end it's going to be revealed like this guy did it all along but then you read it again you already know that you read the bible again you're finding things you didn't know you're connecting things you're seeing things it's this is the master author that we're studying here so okay philadelphia the city um the the characteristic that brother branham brings out is the coin of bacchus now i have a coin of bacchus this wasn't the one that brother branham is talking about in philadelphia if you were to search this on the internet you would find this and then you would find something else on the back but what brother branham explains on this one is that is that it doesn't matter look the coin is minted and and it had the god on the front and it had the priestess on the back and it didn't matter which which way the coin fell you were getting the same thing and now what we had just done was we had just come out of the luther age the time period there where luther came out guess what so before luther christianity was either the true church or the catholic church that's all you had you had that mother harlot right and then but that mother harlow was going to have daughters the thalia was going to have was going to have daughters right so so okay um but those daughters were going to be exactly like her right so she's going to have daughters exactly like her guess what these coins when they're minted they're minted exactly alike every single one of them just another one another one another one so before luther all you had was you had and you had a athelia religion or you had you know just true christianity but then after luther now suddenly because luther protests the catholic church he begins to you know now we have different denominations because we have luther comes out and kind of they create this different thing but then some people disagree with them a little bit and create their own and now you have splintering but what are you getting you're getting daughters when before you just had mother now you're getting daughters you're getting coins minted over and over and over again when i first started reading that the church book and that's i was studying this and i i was like lord how am i going to do this lesson like why is brother bryan talking about a coin who cares like that is this coin is the most uninteresting thing in this church age book what and then you know anytime you're reading the bible or you're reading the message and you're like this is dumb like there's probably something that's like really amazing that you're just missing so like stop say lord okay there's something here because when i saw that point i was like you know mind blown like oh i get it now the mintage of the coin it's the priestess and the god on the same one and then there's more of them i was like oh okay i get it that's denominations like wow okay that's pretty cool so um so that's you know that's that was the characteristic that the age that brother branham brought out is that here they have this coin and it's it's the god and it's the priestess on the back but the age the age has the same thing it has that false god system and it's priestess and it's either mary or the church rather mary here now now some of this is hard to do because you haven't been through like i haven't taken you through lessons you know 35 and 36 i i think lesson 25 where we where we really go through and we take you from nimrod and you go through hislop's two babylons because then pergamos and the pergami in church age brother branham just man he lays that out it's so cool and he lays out what started in at the tower of babel and nimrod and kush started this pagan religion and they had these mysteries and then you get semiramis involved and all through down the history and then suddenly and i'm kind of wishing i would have thrown these slides in but how many of you have seen pictures of mary like on the on the internet like you see you know you type in pictures of mary what color is her hair somebody said blonde just about every picture that you see an artist raphael's mary mike i think michelangelo's married just different ones blonde blonde because artists you know italian artists would paint mary probably similar to girls like the um no not like girls they're used to seeing in italy that's not blonde hair is it oh it's because mary as a jewish girl like raphael was like oh she was a jewish girl i'm gonna paint her with blonde hair yeah that doesn't work either so it what could it be well home maybe because it's semiramis actually who married nimrod was known as the woman this this queen with golden hair that was so absolutely beautiful and oh by the way like these these catholic missionaries went to china and they saw the same exact blond-haired woman with a baby the first catholic missionaries the first catholic missionaries to ever go into china find a madonna and a child with blonde hair and they're like wait how did you get that because we that's our religion and you got that because they both got the same pagan religion from nimrod and semiramis so that's just a little foretaste we're going to get into some of the other things but that's you know it's like that's when this catholic religion started was there at nimrod and it became a pagan thing that was mixed then with christianity you probably know a lot of that but we really break it down but anyway so so let's look at the messenger um john wesley now i was fortunate enough to have traveled to england now i traveled to england to preach before before or right during the early time that i was doing this so i hadn't really like i didn't record this this footage i did it for my family but then i took it and tried to make a nice little video that i'm about to show you that kind of introduces wesley where he was some of some of the you know his house and his church and different things i was there i recorded it so my family could see it and hopefully you find it a blessing so if the brothers can can maybe yeah you could kill the lights that probably be nicer because it's like 10 minutes so i'll just sit down and john wesley the angel messenger of the philadelphian church age was born in epworth uk on june 17 1703 to susanna and samuel wesley let's travel together to epworth to learn of john's young life this morning i am in epworth in the united kingdom this is the home of john and charles wesley as they were children this is the this is the home of the wesleys this is where susannah wesley raised her 17 children and as brother branham said spent the three hours each day to pray with her children and she would read her husband's sermons to the children and the maids and different ones and so um it was here at this location this is not the uh original structure in 1709 the original structure was burned down john wesley was five and a half years old and he was actually in the second story during the fire and uh as this fire is going on john was sure to be consumed in the blaze but was uh very at the last minute plucked out of the window from the second story window uh and saved from from a certain death there so god just uh maintaining the life of his sixth church age messenger to come so this is a very historic home they now have a museum here and for the wesley time period but this is the home where john and charles wesley lived in as children this bible was found in the rubble and miraculously preserved from the fire of the rectory in epworth in later years john referred to himself as a brand plucked from the fire drawing from zechariah 3 verse 2 this painting depicts this event of john being saved from the fire just seconds before the roof collapsed wesley grew and finished primary school and attended oxford university while in school he and some of his friends studied the bible together and did good works they were called methodists for the good methods that they used after some years wesley traveled to america and preached in georgia his trip was not successful he said i went to america to convert the indians but oh who shall convert me finally on may 24th 1738 wesley found salvation about a quarter before 9 while he was describing the change which god works in the heart through faith in christ i felt my heart strangely warmed i felt i did trust in christ christ alone for salvation and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins even mine and saved me from the law of sin and death after his conversion it was no longer merely about works and his fellow man but his preaching took on a new life so much so that the established church of england began to push him out wesley would have to begin preaching outdoors instead of in churches here i have all that was mortal of samuel wesley he was rector of epworth 39 [Music] this is the grave of john wesley's father samuel wesley and actually here in the summer of 1742 john wesley because his preaching was contrary to the prevailing thought of the church of england at the time was kicked out of the church and could not preach inside this beautiful church here behind me so what he did was he came outside and he said this is the grave of my father you can't kick me off of the grave of my own father so he he stood up i won't stand here just respect to the grave and the preservation but he stood up on the grave and began to preach the people and people began to assemble and he said you can't keep me off of my own father's grave so he used his father's grave as his own pulpit to preach to the people in 1742 wesley began traveling across england covering 4 500 miles per year on horseback he preached up to four times a day averaging 800 sermons per year most of them outdoors on the steps of the intersection in ebworth his birthplace and in places like paradise square in sheffield where he said i preached in paradise square in sheffield to the largest congregation i ever saw on a weekday i'm standing in paradise square just up the road from here was the church of england you can see that there in the background and here in paradise square john wesley preached in sheffield england um they wouldn't let him preach in the church so he came over here to paradise square and decided well i can preach right in here and so all the people assembled in here there was more people in the square that was could have fit in the church as you can see here there's quite a large parking area and the acoustics are really good hallelujah so you could hear very well and so john wesley preached here um to a large congregation of people maybe he would have said something like without holiness no man shall see the lord and i really don't even have to raise my voice and i can hear it echoing quite well so paradise square sheffield england over time john wesley built a chapel in london that could be his church home and base of operations i'm at john wesley's chapel and we're headed to see john wesley's house going down the stairs here and into his house you'll notice as we enter john wesley's home the common uh smallness of the english home where things just aren't quite as big it kind of opens up as part of the ceilings here really quite compact i'm standing in john wesley's home the room over here where john wesley himself would have eaten and had food prepared here is his house coat and many of his personal effects his communion glass that he would take with him the family christening robe where they were all the children were baptized in this robe so many of the personal effects and even some of john wesley's hair right there so pretty amazing our tour guide is trying to give us a quick tour so we're gonna head upstairs and see some more i'm here in john wesley's sitting room where after maybe a meal you would have come and and had a bit of fellowship with uh with john wesley here over they have charles wesley's desk uh very likely that he may have penned hims from this desk right here so that is a very cool treasure of history here's wesley's sitting room his personal books oh my goodness really old books that were wesley's over here we have a very interesting chair this chair right here with the funky arms it was a fighting chair um and um wesley turned it into a reading chair you would sit on it backwards put your arms on it and use the the tray to put the book on which emulated kind of like riding a horse and reading a book on a horse i stood in this pulpit that where you go every morning five o'clock and preach to fifteen hundred people i said in his chair where he wanted a chicken uh a fighter that a fellow used to fight had rooster fight he wanted to christ and had a letter over like this and two big horns and a place like this is set up on this side like here where they take record of the fight and after wesley was converted uh wesley converted this man to christ then he gave him the chair and i sat in the chair and prayed standing inside wesley's chapel built in 1739 so john wesley could have a home base of sorts in london this behind me is john wesley's pulpit it actually used to be as high as the balcony but they took the middle section out because that that became unfashionable much of the decoration you can see the hideous columns behind me are not original originally they had beams uh taken from british warships uh and recycled uh but those riddled with bullet holes and worms didn't last but a hundred years behind me here is the communion table where john wesley himself would have served communion and of course here's the back side of the pulpit that he would have preached out of so quite a bit of history here we end this video at john wesley's memorial grave where many come including brother branham in 1950 to pay their respects to this great man of god to the memory of the venerable john wesley this great light arose by the singular providence of god to enlighten these nations and to revive and force and defend the pure apostolical doctrines and practices of the primitive church which he continued to do both by his writings and his labors for more than half a century and to his inexpressible joy not only be held their influence extending and their efficacy witnessed in the hearts and lives of many thousands but also far above all human power of expectation lived to see provision made by the singular grace of god for their continuance and establishment to the joy of future generations reader if thou art constrained to bless the instrument give god the glory after having languished a few days he at length fulfilled his course and his life together gloriously triumphing over death march the 2nd 1781 in the 88th year of his age where he converted the rooster fighter that time on this chair i had his robe over my shoulder nailed in the floor where that godly man died and offered prayer and thank god for a man like john wesley amen so i hope you enjoyed that um thank you i did one um i did one on columba as well that was terrible i had to travel to the lion uh to the island of iona in scotland and um you know i had to suffer for two three days on that island yeah it was tough it was tough i loved every minute of it there was no mcdonald's though it was a small island and and and if you wanted to eat you had to be at the hotel at the right time and i was not used to that so there was one time i was uh i got up early in the morning and i went to where columbus came to the bay and i was trying to do some filming there and then i realized like i'm a i'm a good brisk 50-minute walk away and breakfast closes in an hour so i hoofed it over and i got my breakfast because it would have been nothing nothing until noon because that's just how it worked and it's not america that's for sure it was a small island but it was lovely so i did one i went there specifically to shoot a video for that so this one wasn't shot specifically for it and i didn't you know there's a lot of wind and stuff but that was the best i could do on a on a budget you know so i hope that was a blessing and just enjoyed that so now um that's the introduction to to the messenger and i let the video do that instead of having to actually talk about it but we can then go into um in the church age uh message brother brenham says many books of his talking about john wesley was wrote of slander about him in his day slandering him making fun of him they've long been forgotten now and so has their authors you can't do nothing against a child of god and get by with it you just you just fighting the air god is going to take them right on through anyhow i think that's pretty instructive to us today and there are many people wanting to slander the messenger of this age there'll come a time that will long be forgotten but if this thing goes on this message it's going to keep shining amen so so that kind of closes our introduction to the age um or well to the to the city to the messenger i want to just talk about the conditions of the age just a little bit and what was going on there and so we we understand because we know the seals now uh we understand that this is now the age of man that we've come through the lion age we've come through the ox age and now we're in the age of man and and the catholic church has now been protested and now we have reformers coming out great reformers and they're coming and they're preaching they're making bibles they're printing literature they're spreading it out all across the earth and there's a great reformation and and a great awakening and a second great awakening beginning to happen and so there's missionaries going out and and going and taking the gospel of jesus christ to all the earth now brother branham begins to to talk about this because this is what this age is doing now as far as literally just going sending the message of the gospel on paper tracks and so forth the gospel has long ago went to every nation under the heavens long ago so you see that goes to prove that wasn't what jesus was talking about when he never said go into all the world and make bible schools neither did he say go all into all the world and pass out literature those things are fine there's a place for those things there's a time for those things but his commission to the church was go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is not altogether the word but it's making the word come to life if we're gonna preach the gospel if we're gonna say hey you know like so what does gospel mean well well we understand it means the good news but but did jesus now now when we say we're preaching the gospel as christians in our day you know or if you say you know let's say what the baptist's uh definition of preaching the gospel would be what would that mean and i think sometimes that's what our definition of is is the same you know is it's because since wesley's age we think preaching the gospel what does that mean telling people that jesus came and died for their sins that's what we think preaching the gospel is it's not that the gospel that jesus died for your sins that should be a fairly basic christian you know thing that most everybody understands in that way but i but but jesus came and preached the gospel well what gospel was he preaching he wasn't preaching hate jesus came and died for your sins no what he was saying was the kingdom of heaven is coming to you no the messiah is coming that thing that you're the good news is that thing that you're looking for the thing that you're seeking for in your life these jews are waiting their entire lives for generation after generation for thousands of years they've been promised a coming messiah from the genesis chapter three man they're waiting for a messiah to come and so jesus comes along and he begins to preach the good news that the kingdom of heaven has come to you messiah is here that's the good news and if messiah is here well what's he going to do he's going to do the things prophesied of the messiah to do he's going to set the captives free he's going to bind up the brokenhearted he's going to set at liberty them that are bruised and captive we're supposed to preach the gospel that's the gospel that jesus preached we're supposed to preach the gospel has the gospel changed has it changed that actually what we're saying when we're when we're preaching the gospel is good news the kingdom of heaven has come unto you and messiah is here that he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the messiah has come and he's going to do messiah things like setting captives free opening the blinded eyes it's making the word come to life messiah is here in our age and and truly what we're hearing because the prophet has come with this message of restoration is what they had at pentecost you still have because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and what jesus preached then he's still preaching now what jesus did then he's still doing now good news has come to you jesus is alive and well [Applause] so that's the commission to the church the commission to the church let's go on so therefore when i say the pentecostal message not the pentecostal organization now the pentecostal message is the only true message from god why why is the pentecostal message the only true message of god well it's because what is the pentecostal message saying the holy ghost is still here has come and can live in you now look mark 16. if you're reading it there all right here jesus commissioned his church go into all the world preach the gospel these signs speaking in tongues healing the sick performing miracles we'll ask how far all the world how many every creature that's all the way down to the end here to the consummation all right these signs shall follow just this church them that believe in all the world all the world to every creature these signs shall follow them not this not this church them the people that believe so it's a pentecostal church the philadelphian church age in that age there evangelized and has missionaried all the complete world with literature jesus said when this gospel is preached this gospel is preached to all the world for a witness to me then the end shall be so what he's saying and well read it but just you know let me preach it here for just a moment what he's saying is is that when jesus said and i believe it's matthew 24 that that hey when when the gospel is preached to the entire world the end shall be and if passing out literature and tracts and bibles to the entire world which has happened at this point if that was preaching the gospel then the word of god is in default of that promise of what he said here that the end shall be we should have reached the end but since we haven't reached the end there's other two there's only two possibilities the word is wrong and we don't believe that one so it's got to be the other possibility that the gospel has not actually been preached to all the world why not because passing out the literature telling people that jesus died for them was not preaching the gospel but the gospel was the good news that jesus christ is still here and he's come to you amen not that he died in history for you and you can theologically assent to that and accept that sacrifice and decide you're going to go to heaven with zero life change that's not what we're talking about but good hello it's way better than that the very one that died has come to you wants a relationship with you wants to live in your heart wants to change you and take you from just not someone sitting on a pew not someone sitting on a barstool but to take you and literally fill you with the life of god zoe god's own life what a privilege what a blessing the very one that created heavens and earth and said let there be light let there be this let there be that created everything and said wow that's good that sustains every breath of every being the power of this universe wants to come and put himself on the inside of you and this is the gospel why is this the gospel because once he gets inside of you he doesn't just as i said to our church look when you get the holy ghost it's not just it's not just taking you to heaven it's not just your get out of jail free card from that game we were talking about brother mike it's not just to get out of jail free card like i get to go to heaven because i have the holy ghost yay is that what it is to you no it's so much more what did the holy ghost do in jesus so i told our church well hey it's 2021 we might as well speak the new language you know holy ghost gonna holy ghost what he did in jesus he's still gonna do in you when he lives in you he's still going to bind up the brokenhearted he's still going to set captives free he's still going to he's still going to open the eyes of the blind but he's going to do it through you this is the gospel this is the good news that jesus christ is alive and well it's not just passing out tracks but it's i am that tract you want to see jesus christ here you go go ahead and read john 3 16 not on my t-shirt but in my life he is alive and well why because he's living in me oh that's you preachers of course no no that's the 14 year old girls that's to 22 19 you know something like that i won't keep asking people's ages people get nervous i can already tell it like oh this brother's coming down the aisle and it ain't going to be good it's to you as an individual holy ghost gonna holy ghost in your life he's gonna do things the holy ghost has done all throughout all ages in your life he is longing he's he's wanting to break free but not to break free out of you but to break through flowing out of you because your life just can't contain all of him man what gets inside of you he's just like oh yeah this is good i got another one but man i'm just gonna push and stretch and get you to grow and get you into places that you never thought you'd be as we talked about this morning when you set that mark high and you begin to achieve and grow and and practice and my it's wonderful why because the holy ghost is inside of you saying i've got to express who i am it's jesus christ god almighty his life living on inside of you that can't that just isn't like oh oh yes the holy ghost well praise jesus thank you jesus i'm gonna sit here in the corner i'm going to heaven you going to heaven i'm going to oh i'm sorry it's more than that amen right it's more than that the commission is not to this church it's not to this church it's not to that it's to you as an individual you as an individual i said brother trevor we sisters we're not preachers well not behind a pulpit that's right but to your children glory yes you sure are fifth gospel you are the gospel every single one of you you are a gospel the bride of christ is the next gospel go ahead and preach the gospel what is that you with the power of the holy ghost on the inside of you you've been called to something amazing to something great too long we sit and we bicker about doctrines and we go back and forth over this and that and the other and there's man that's fine i get it you know we want to have proper doctrine but that's not what this message is what this message is saying is this is pentecost this is messiah this is his second coming this is him living in you this is him reigning on the on this earth right now showing all the world through your life that he is alive and well the power of the gospel living through you that's preaching not just teaching the doctrines but the word coming to life well then if that's what he was talking about spreading out literature sending out missionaries with reading writing arithmetic passing out tracks making people shake hands believe that there is a god if that's all it was then he's far past his coming paul said the gospel didn't come in word only but through power manifestations of the holy ghost then when jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel he said go into the world and demonstrate oh i like that demonstrate the power of the gospel taking that word that that what it says and show the people what it says then make it manifest to them oh that proves it how do we prove scripture manifest it how do we do that well let's talk about that so i was in prayer recently and and and god god had been speaking to me for far too long two or three years i would say and i needed a deeper prayer life he said brother trevor it took two or three yeah yeah yeah how are you doing okay so anyway not alone all right so god has been telling me like you got to have better prayer life like i need you but you're not praying enough i mean and this isn't to say i don't pray you know i pray all the time you know mostly pray lying down in bed before falling asleep and that can take 20 minutes sometimes so that's good prayer you know you people that fall asleep so fast man you know what you're never mind anyway god was telling me no no you need to get on your knees you need to pray not not that i believe that you have to get on your knees to pray but but that god was asking me to step into a a a greater sincerity in my prayer and and you know look if you've got issues with your knees like i'm not i'm not persecuting you here but you know like whatever it is for you like is there a way that you can get into a deeper prayer than lying down and praying as you fall asleep because that's good that's fine but but how sincere is that i mean you could argue either way i guess but i can tell you that god was telling me no i i want you to give me some dedicated time and prayer and then after you get off your knees then you can keep praying on your bed until you fall asleep and that'll be nice but what i want from you is a deeper prayer life and i heard god tell me that for two or three solid years before i started actually doing it well praise the lord we're just going to be honest here i'm interested in proving this is real this quote right here i want to manifest that i want to prove the reality of this word in my life i was telling god so i got down on my knees i began to pray and after a while i was like lord i okay here i am i'm praying lord and if i'm gonna do this if i'm gonna be sincere god i want to be powerful is that wrong you know i'm not saying i you know for me like i think i'm going to be some message superhero with a kate you know but message teacher but i was tired of getting pushed back i was tired of faith waning in the people i was tired of people having so many questions i felt it was a stain on believers at times that we we feel so powerless when we have such a powerful message in word and gospel i told god that i knew it wasn't his fault but i knew that it was brother branham as i said this morning said i was living far below my privileges i said god i'm not trying to be selfish i'm not trying to have visions of grandeur it's not about me becoming a superhero but i don't want to see the work of christ blasphemed and pushed around any longer because it can and should be proved right i wanted to be a vessel that was clean and sincere and ready to be used should he need anything see i think sometimes the problem that we have particularly in this day is i think that we when we talk about the power of god we don't understand what that is and the problem is is that we have so much culture that perverts our understanding of what power is and you say well what is that brother trevor and some of you getting nervous again because you don't want me to go there and talk about those marvelous things that we watch those those things are just absolutely a marvel to us like superheroes if you hadn't catch the whole marvel thing yet because here's here's the thing like how do you understand being infused with power from a a a godlike source let's just say right well like you know well how does that happen well a spider bites you or you know you get some kind of you know uh scientific experiment gone wrong you know or you know something happens to you and makes you different and then we begin to think well this was must be what like the holy ghost is is this i have you know i'm basically a science experiment gone wrong now that the holy ghost has come on the inside of me and now i have super powers in my gifting and i get to you know throw a hammer or you know i get you know webs that come out of my wrists or you know i get cool things that happen when i decide i need this thing to happen and so i do it and i'm in control of this thing you know that that because i'm a superhero now and so i go do superhero things and so we begin to think like that's what it means to be a powerful christian that must be what the holy ghost is like is that i get to now that i'm filled with the holy ghost i get to go and you know poof and bang and different things am i talking to someone here or you all just thinking like this man is teaching blasphemies right now he's comparing the holy ghost to superheroes and if i'm sorry if that offends you i don't mean to do that but i'm trying like i'm trying to actually weave some culture into this message and show us like this is where we're at this is the kind of movies that young people and the old people and different people lots of people are watching unfortunately some are watching them even unfiltered which there's a lot of cussing in those movies i don't know if you knew that or not but i'm just saying so we began to think of the holy ghost like a superhero and then then we then we're totally ineffective and we can't do anything because we got the picture all skewed because when it comes to the holy ghost you don't get to control it it's not some power that comes on the inside of you that you get to weld and shoot something out of your staff or throw your hammer or make things happen that don't work like that it works because you yield it works because you give him control it works because you recognize i'm not just some you know scientific experiment gone wrong and got hit with some yellow goo or something like that but it works because actually i i repented and said god i'm nothing and i need you and he said okay i can work with that and you stay there stay in that you i need you god area stay right there cause i can work with someone who's saying i need you and isn't that what god was telling me get back to i need you on your knees trevor why do you wait two and three years to do this why don't you just get on your knees and start yielding yourself do you know why we don't pray sometimes we don't pray because we don't have faith we just really like well what's it gonna do yeah is he really there is he really gonna hear yeah yeah he will but a lot of times we don't pray we don't get on our knees we'll pray in almost any other any other position than actually on our knees like i don't know if that's just i'm just preaching me like this is my life i kind of i preached this at our church and this one brother was like yeah right he ain't preaching about himself he's talking about me so i just kind of realized that i'm probably not all that strange but you know why else we don't pray because we like control and if you're gonna pray properly you know what it means when you do this in front of someone and bow your head yielding submission you have the control man it's 20 21. what are you talking about who does that who gives control to anyone no i am i i am an american i am man i am me i have self-esteem i can be whatever i want to be yeah sure amen you can be but that's not what god wants you to be god wants you to submit god wants you to heal amen how are we going to prove this my slide is gone but how are we going to prove it how are we going to prove how how are we going to find ourselves in a condition that we can we can truly make it manifest to the people and prove it to them how we gonna do that how are you gonna are you doing that in your life now like i hope you are at times it it happens that god uses me you know sometimes there's there's x-rays that had cancer and then we prayed and that there isn't any more yeah take that atheist unexplained natural phenomenon yeah yeah that happens awful lot sometimes there's just too many coincidences and it's like oh maybe actually the bible's just true it is true and when you get into the channel when you do as it says and you take the word show the people what it says and you make it manifest how you do that by actually living it taking the word showing the people what it says not showing the here look see what it says mother see see no no see what the word says see what the word does read it right here this ain't arrogance this is a vessel for almighty god amen so we want to prove it well how we how are we going to prove it i struck man this one hit me and i'll just tell you a little more of the testimony that of of what i've been dealing with and what i've gone through over the last about five months um september 16th about a week i had been having i had had this tightness in just in my upper back and it was just it's happened before and you know about a week later it'll it'll go away and and i decided man i am so tight this morning oh i just so i felt like i just need to stretch and i started stretching and this muscle right here that cramped you know i don't know if you ever played soccer and you cramp or football or something like that you get a cramp what do you do you have one of your buddies grab your leg and start pushing and you're just sitting there going hahaha that feels good but it's good you know like just do it it's coming you know nobody can that muscle like you can't somebody stretch me like it it don't work but i still pounded on the floor going this hurts like man this hurts and i didn't know it at the time but what it was is i had ruptured somehow at some point in time i don't know if it happened then at that moment or when it happened but i had ruptured the disc between c6 and c7 which is the last two in vertebrae in the base of your neck you say brother trevor you're 41 you're too young for that hey man yeah yeah what'd you do nothing cool apparently i have no idea i wish it would have been doing something cool but you know at least skiing i don't know something but no no i'm just laying on the floor stretching and i'm in serious pain i don't know if anybody's ever dealt with that kind of thing if you've ever had a ruptured disc in your back but there's some nods there's some amens that was the start of chronic pain for the next five months i didn't know what that was like i knew that the lord was probably using this to teach me something so i told the brothers i said you know maybe this is just the lord teaching me empathy i just hope i learn that lesson real quick problem is is you can't learn empathy for someone who has chronic pain real quick that don't work it takes about five months to learn that lesson but that's not the only lesson god wanted to teach me he wanted to teach me some other things one of them deals with this right here because i you know first i thought oh it's muscles it's this and finally okay let's go get an mri and got an mri okay it's your it's your spot or it's your base of your neck but we were doing your upper back so now we got to send you and get you another mri in your neck so we can make sure that that's all good thanks that's nice another two weeks before we can actually figure out what's totally wrong here two weeks and then like okay and then now you need to have an appointment with a spine doctor see what they're gonna say but by the way you know you probably you know we're gonna try to not have surgery okay that's nice all right so let's start doing physical therapy if i'm not going to do surgery it's going to be physical therapy that's just the only other option so i start doing physical therapy and you know and i'm a good boy like i do my physical therapy and i do it religiously and you know if i felt like i could get over it faster by doing three times the physical therapy hey sign me up man i'm done with this pain about about middle of december two three months into it you know i was telling a brother i said man i said if they tell me that i need surgery i'm just like i hurt so bad right now i'm just gonna say when tomorrow good let's go it hurts and i want this to end hurts a lot i don't know if i mean those of you that dealt with chronic playing chronic pain god bless you those that haven't like man may the lord help you to have empathy without ever going through it and not ever having to learn it i didn't understand it wears you down and wears you down and every day day after day after day it's still there you know you put icy hot on to go to sleep so that you can focus on the burning more than the pain because that's a bit more comfortable that's weird man it's like oh good it feels you know it burns so good like yes that's much better said no one except for those in chronic pain like that's terrible that's a terrible way to live and you wake up and it's still there and you go to bed and it's still there and every day it's there and it's there and it's there and it's there and it's like how you doing how are you doing i'm here i'm here i'm here you better sit right or it's i'm really going to be here yeah that's it's rough i'm not just trying to get you guys to cry about it but i'm just trying to get you to understand like where i was at because that that's kind of important and so so i'm ready i'm like look if they say surgery let's do it i'm done you know and so then they finally i get the spine doctor and the spine doctor hears that i'm doing this therapy and he's like oh you're awesome you'll be the best patient ever there's no way we're doing surgery on you because you're such a good boy oh that's nice it hurts like you can tell me i'm a good boy well you want like thank you i appreciate it i'm trying really hard but this hurts when's it over when's it over oh probably two months okay two months it's already been three ouch so um so then i get this i get this appointment set up with he says after he says well you could you could go and get these epidural shots they kind of help you sometimes anti-inflammatory injected right into your into your spine where you need anti-inflammatory so things will shrink back because they're swollen okay well that maybe sounds alright that i mean i don't know about having somebody put a needle in my spine that doesn't sound so great but hey if it's gonna okay so i got to a place like all right i'm done with the pain give me the shot stick the needle in my spine i'm good with it let's go let's do this okay set up an appointment finally got to that day of appointment and i'm like thank you jesus uh the relief is coming i've got this appointment and i'm i'm i'm so thankful that the relief is coming and because i was really hoping the doctors were just going to help me take care of this because i believe that jesus could heal me but but he wasn't that's hard like lord i know you can do this i don't know why you're not but i know you could do this but it hurts so i'm really hoping this shot helps because because like i'm going through this and you're not taking it away so um i won't do what the doctor says because that's what prophet says do but i really want this pain to be gone and and i hurt really really really bad and so i went to this appointment like yay they you know sent over my stuff from the spine doctor because i set it up through him and so they should have all my documentation okay here i am good boy but i want the shot thank you here i am oh you're not getting that shot today today is the appointment to get that appointment like this is your initial consultation did i mention to anyone that i was in pain and i wanted a shot to take the pain away today did anybody get that and so they sent me packing out the little door come back next tuesday eight days from now before you get any relief it'll be eight more days i already waited two weeks for this appointment i get to wait one more let me give you a little back story so i would say maybe two weeks prior to this appointment i was just in prayer on sunday morning sitting there in the pew and i just cried i was crying out to god i said god i can't do this this hurts and i mean i'm just you know i didn't even have a hanky that day and and i'm just i'm drowning in my own tears i'm i'm just like god i know you can heal me i don't know why you're not obviously i need more faith but god i don't know how to have more faith what do i do god like i don't i honestly god i don't know how to have more faith got through the service i mean man services were hard our our pews were just not tall enough i needed just four more inches so i could really just put my back against something to support it and just man services would be painful it would be just rough but you know like i'm just i'm a trooper man i'm i'm going to church right you know that's what i did it hurt didn't really enjoy it much but i went so i prayed and i said god i don't know how to have more faith well not too long after that after service in the parking lot this brother comes up to me he's a good brother even if he is annoying and he comes up to me and says brother how's it back and it's like yeah it hurts brother it hurts i mean i healed in the name of jesus but oh man that hurts brother like and he's like well he said i went through that i know what it's like you know i said he said there were there were nights that i'd just be flat on my back and i couldn't sleep because it hurt so bad and and i just kept confessing like thank you jesus for healing me thank you jesus for healing he's like brother just keep confessing it was brother thank you i i do you know brother wade i had never thought of that he was this kind brother coming to me a message preacher to tell me i should confess the word of god well it was great thank you brother i didn't know that god bless you i didn't connect it with the prayer that i had just prayed i was just like well this is a well-meaning brother but man i don't hear it right now i hurt i just like somebody else do the faith because i hurt so i have this appointment that i told you all about and i left that appointment that i did not get the shot did i mention that i did not get the shot and i was not happy about it and my emotions are just right here on the edge and i'm ready to just throw something or break down and crying and i i'm driving home and guess who calls me i might not make it through this without crying guess who calls me my annoying brother why is he calling me why is he calling me what am i gonna do put on a smiley face how you doing brother good to hear from you how's your day oh i'm doing just fine brother how's your day it's not a good day brother it's not a good day oh sorry what's going on and you know everything i just told you and so i told that to him he's like well brother guess what he said to me i know it hurt just keep confessing the word of god thank you brother and i told them i said brother i was telling jesus just the other day that i don't know how to have more faith and the conversation was pretty much over because i was crying and i couldn't talk anymore and so we ended the call and i'm like i'm just gonna sit here for eight days and wait for a shot i guess but man that just rung in my ears and i was like i know i i know i should confess the word of god more i know i should be better about this because i'm i'm kind of bad about it actually so i started reading that little book brother george smith put out the healing thoughts book and i started reading it man and i just started getting spiritual spanking after spiritual spanking me this preacher up here was getting spiritually spanked don't worry you know we're just men and men just like you i'm just a brother with a gift i'm no different than you none of these brothers are different they're just brothers with gifts you have gift we have a gift it's just this one happens to be up in front it's all so i'm getting spiritual spank you know try believing the word of god try believing the word of god try actually confessing it like you meant it try actually you know hey try actually recognizing god is not a god of history but he's the god of i am and he's more you know and the word of god the promise of god is actually more real than your pain amen and that's what god started teaching me over the next three days and i actually started confessing the word of god and confessing the word of god and like i meant it i still got the shot i got the second one too probably get the third one in a couple of weeks but don't worry i feel a lot better was it the shot brother trevor was it confessing the word of god well probably a little bit of both actually i'm not ashamed of that but i actually started confessing the word of god and i and i began to think about it and you know what actually you know when you take the word and what it says and show people what it says and make it manifest to them and i began to think you know there was this man by the name of john ryan you know he couldn't who couldn't see he was a catholic boy he didn't even know how to have faith man and he just and brother branham said hey confess the word of god you said you believe me go confess it extra extra praise god for healing me until finally he finds himself in a barber chair to get a shave and they begin to make fun of him and he says that's right praise god for healing me and what happened he took the word of god what it says and he showed the people what it says and he manifested it to him guess what john ryan did to the barber i don't know if the barber was an atheist a skeptic or whatever he was but the word of god was absolutely proven to that man through the life of john ryan i begin to think god i will that's yes sign me up for that god i want to believe the word of god like that i want to confess the word of god like that confess it like i actually believe it's true pray like i actually believe that i'm talking to someone when i pray pray like i actually believe that someone will speak to my heart amen amen because i'm a christian because i believe the word of god because i'm going to manifest and preach the gospel which means that jesus christ is alive and well today in me and i don't have to deal with it maybe i got to deal with this pain but i got a promise that's better than the pain that tells me even when it hurts i'm real and if you and if you're hurting it's because i'm putting you through this for a purpose because you don't have enough faith and you need a brother to come tell you break you down a couple of pegs and show you you don't have that faith let him annoy you okay thanks lord thanks appreciate it because it slapped me into reality what's reality the promise the promise the promise now well let's see here i just wanted to go because we talked about superheroes and and then i'm then i moved on from that i don't know maybe so this is out of the lesson 35 and 36 from the church age book and i just wanted to go through this as we talked about the superhero thing because that's what we're talking about is is manifesting like a power that is not you being manifested so that's kind of like a superhero and we get that wrong so so so back in the days of nimrod and and this is this is the genesis 3 15 is the first prophecy of the coming messiah in scripture i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed what was her seed the coming messiah it shall bruise thy head thou shalt bruise his heel and they understood that the symbol here they understood what this meant that when it talked about his heel being bruised that it likely meant his death so what happened was is there was a there was a the next slide there was a similar polytheism that that started at the time of nimrod so they had this symbol of janus or cush or bell with his club so he was both the confuser and the interpreter of the gods he had two faces this this original kush which was nimrod's father who became the first god so to speak he was the interpreter and the confuser which doesn't make any sense wait if some if somebody's interpreting how is he confusing it well actually god confused it they tried to say that cush was the interpreter and god was confusing it but if god confuses the languages and cush is the interpreter then there's a god that's more powerful than kush so kush has to be the one that does it and you just have to live with it not making sense that's just paganism for you there you go and and and so he had a claw a club and see what he did with his club is he he smashed everything and confused the languages that's what that's what he did with his club so so there he was he's got two faces here and he's got a club that was this original god that started in this early early early paganism there at the tower of babel are we together we're just going back in time real fast bringing out this little point okay so we can go to the next side you know janice has a club i mean uh thor has a club um and and thor kills the serpent by hitting it in the head with his club like genesis 3 15 with it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise its heel and the serpent kills thor during the same battle so my what's what is this this is nothing but a perversion of the messianic story so so as you're watching your marvel movie i just want you to understand that if you've watched that first thor movie which i watched just full disclosure it was so blatant so blatantly you know the bride you know the girl is behind him as he walks forward and sacrifices his life so he can save and then you know he rises like hello and we get excited about those stories but a lot of times we don't get excited about jesus christ hello church i mean something's wrong there right when we get excited about the perversion more than the reality so then so then the next slide we can look at just another one achilles who was the son of a god and how does achilles die but by getting shot in the heel why does achilles like who thought that up like why why is achilles why is his weak spot the heel genesis 3 15. i i could i could show you example after example that would just just blow your mind on all of all all of these superheroes and all of these stories and all of these different myths throughout every single culture in the world has these kinds of things they are perversions of genesis 3 15. and and things like their only weakness is the heal or they die in a healer they have a cert a battle with a great serpent at the end you know one of them even with even with thor is that is that he it's the midgard serpent that he that he ends up kills and by the way that apparently the thor movies like that they're not actually on the myth so if you think like well he has no idea what he's talking about no i actually know the myth not the movie quite as much but but one of them is he goes to find the midgard serpent and he's he's fishing for the serpent and as he's as he's got the serpent he's pulling it up his heel goes through the boat yeah chen is 3 15. the serpent's going to bruise his heel like it is just over and over and over again that you find these things so i just one of the reasons because i wanted to bring in this whole superhero idea because and and i wanted to show you these things is that that do not forget that maybe this seems innocent maybe it's not not that bad and we can watch it and that sort of thing and i'm not gonna stand here and be legalistic and tell you what you can and can't watch and all of those things even though i told you all the closure netflix accounts this morning but all right like be spirit-led okay be spirit-led but as you're being spirit-led make sure that you understand that the devil would like to get in these things in his various ways to pervert it without your knowledge to where then you're in prayer going god i i need like i need the power to just you know i i need you know i need the the young lady with the vial of you know juice to pour in my in my lips so that my back will get healed like where's that lord well nowhere believe the word of god amen because that's the power amen faith in the word of god that's the power and we get these ideas of where the power comes from you know because you know what else is you know getting a shot in your neck and you know this just comes to me just you know but am i wait you know is the shot in my neck the girl with the little vial of super juice because i tell you what when i'm sitting there in bed after my first shot and i'm still in pain but the first shot helped and i was about a week later i'm like oh man i can't wait for that next shot i'm just being honest and i realized dear lord i am just what am i a druggie like i can't wait for this next shot why why am i why is my mind sitting here going i can't wait for the next shot when i have the god of all the power all the power in the universe is my friend and lives inside of me so why am i sitting here going i can't wait for the next shot oh my goodness like no why am i not saying god thank you is he not more real than the shot is here isn't he where's your faith is he or isn't he and that's what god is teaching me in pain laying down flat on my back going what do you actually believe i put you through this and now you're now it's coming to a place where you've got to manifest and it's not about all of these things it's not about how you might see these things or how it might be skewed but it's actually the word of god stands true and do you have faith in it and if you have faith in it why aren't you why is your mind not getting to a place where it is you know like the quote that says the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass why because the right and mental attitude can stem from the right understanding the right heart that says god your word is true come what may it doesn't matter what the symptoms say your word is truth and that's where it's at so unfortunately all these superheroes and all these different things they've gotten our ideas skewed on on truly what it means to have faith it's not a superhero faith but it's a faith in just the word of god it's a faith in the truth brother ryan says what if i go out here tonight and say see say i see the moon shining what are you shining about moon and the moon would say it's not me shining it's the sun shining on me that's what it is if you live close enough to god so the power of the holy spirit can fall on you it'll reflect the presence of god amen and my angel shall go before thee from 1953 brother branham says now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before the almighty god in the name of jesus christ he doesn't realize what a power that is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for god's word is true so if it comes out if it's a promise out of the word of god if you can just appropriate the faith to believe it and ask god for it you don't realize the power that you have why part of it is you set the mark too low we stopped right but today we're preaching the gospel power of the gospel that proves the gospel because it lives this is what i want in my life i want my life to preach the gospel i want my life to manifest the gospel and and and and so why wouldn't i get into prayer to get closer to the one to get myself so i can reflect him in the way that he ought to be reflected oh my goodness that's what i've got to have i need it i want to have it and and if prayer is the ticket to get there yeah amen i'll do that because it's important like because it's time church it's time to rise it it's it's we did what are we saying this morning um let the worshiper arise it's time to arise church we're living in the last days going home it's just around the corner there's there's a short quick work to be done and you're part of it you're a part of the final voice to the final age so let's get in prayer let's get to a pla let's let's sell it out and then let's go like status quo isn't working what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them think of it i've seen a poor woman here some time ago that she was so yielded to the wrong spirit till it throwed her on her back and her feet was up like that she crawled on her back like a snake and she didn't know nothing about it for two years he's in an insane institution he sees this they come to pray for and and brother branham's like oh my goodness you know and he's he's thinking well you know brother brandon like i'm gonna pray for this girl and he reaches his hand out and he's like don't do that brother branham he's like well you know i got the power of god right like i'm gonna pray for this woman i'm gonna i gotta lay my hand on her and she like threw him across the room and hid it in into a wall so here's this woman so yielded so powerful because of her yielding to the wrong thing that she's she's she's on her back like this and she's she's slithering like a snake along the floor that's how yielded this woman i hope i got my mic here's still working that's how yielded this woman is to the wrong spirit how powerful this woman has come because of her ultimate her absolute yielding to the wrong spirit no doubt that that was a i don't know what kind of spirit that was i don't know what she must have done to put herself in that position but i bet you she thought she was going to enjoy it a whole lot more than she did but how much more when we're yielded like if a woman can be that powerful and that that yielded to be that crazy to to go along the floor on a snake and throw brother branham across the room how about if you're yielded to the right thing man i guarantee you you're not gonna crawl on your back not like a snake you're gonna be in your right mind you're gonna be happy and what kind of power well maybe probably not the power where prophet grabs your hand and you throw them across the room probably not that kind of power but the power to prove that god is alive and well a better power than one that throws somebody across the room man i'll take that that sounds nice sign me up for that lord okay how am i gonna get that yield yield to the holy spirit how am i gonna what's what's the best way i know to yield that's the best way i know to yield and god has been trying to tell me that for two or three years and i finally started three or four weeks ago church i think that's what god's calling us to do is yield better yeah brother nathan at our church has been preaching the series on yield we're on part 85 kind of waiting for the church to get it so we could move on to a different series yield how are we going to do that well maybe we should start maybe just just just can you do something for me can you do can can tonight can you just go home just get on your knees church like start like like brother trevor i don't know like things probably conditions have to be right like maybe in a couple weeks brother trevor i'll actually start praying more no can you can you just start just tonight tonight one brother told me he's like brother trevor i i didn't do it that night i did it the next night we got home so late from church but the next night he said i got on my knees it was only 60 seconds but i got my knees i said good job brother how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time how do you start a good prayer life so that you can yield to christ so that you can have more power in your life we'll get on your knees like start like i'll take 30 seconds on your knees in prayer i'll take five minutes i'll take 20 he'll take he'll take whatever you want to give him but church church of the living god can we be more sincere can we begin god is god's desiring us to be more sincere god's desiring us to be more in prayer god's desiring to give us this kind of power in our lives he doesn't want us to sit around and let the message be pushed around and let let blasphemy blast beamers go and let let families question and not sure this is that or whatever like no it should be plainly obvious when you come into this church that that jesus christ is alive and well that this message is nothing but the truth why because he lives and reigns in the hearts of the believers and it's not like that's not just what like that's not just an evangelical saying it's a manifested reality that proves that god is real glory that's what i want my life right i'm tired of anything less and here ye him brother brahm says peter got all excited the supernatural had been done there stood moses elijah both been dead for for for years here they were standing alive he's talking about man's transfiguration standing there with jesus witnesses two of the mightiest prophets that ever walked the earth standing side by side to watch god adopt his own son it gave him all the powers in heavens and earth given unto his hands jesus had this power all powers in heaven and son and earth given to the man christ jesus we believe that don't we don't worry i'm almost done i'm sorry i've been long well i say that but there's people falling asleep so i know i know it's been a long afternoon so that's why i'm saying i'm almost done so wake up for a second we'll be done okay to watch god adopt his own son it gave him all the powers in heavens and earth given unto his hands we believe this all powers on earth was given to the man christ jesus he will do for you the same if you'll stand after you receive the holy ghost make yourself a christian and and act like a christian should if you'll put your faith in god's word your eyes towards heaven let your pants legs or your skirts be bagged at the knees be reverent before god there'll be someday that god will take you over to a side one where and give you to a power and a gift that the whole world will know that he's been with you that's placing a son to his position hallelujah amen he will do the same for you he will give you a power he will give you a gift brother trevor like what is my i don't know what it is but know that like the word of god will not fail if you if you will act like a christian put your face in the word of god and pray like you actually believe what we've been preaching actually believe what we've been hearing actually believe what you've been confessing and start to live that we will manifest the word of god and prove it musicians can come so how we would end this in our church is i would give you your assignment which is lesson 55 and remind you remind you to work on your memorization work and we just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord i i just want you lord i want you i need you so much lord father i don't
