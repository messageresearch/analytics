what we can we need him along the way and moving backwards and forth and have that that way we can have plenty of help that was the one thing I was at General Motors I was an absentee replacement well doing that see it's kind of hard to do a lot of time to be an absentee replace what we call Richard absentee around here because you know and I had to know 40 something jobs you know to be able to go and run each one of those jobs because I was absentee for all of that and sometimes it was fun that we got by and I enjoyed it all right Joe 2:22 be not a Frazee beast of the field for the for the pastures of the wilderness do spring now listen says it's an upward now we should I'm trying to help us all to pull more into an upswing of things because we we need it you know and to look and see what is taking place among us in the land and now ought to be enough to know and realize that we're in the end and it's finishing up so this that's what we praise God for for the pastures of the wilderness new spring for the tree birth for fruit the fig tree and divine do yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now what's in one month it's going to come all right so it's got to be a quick work and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with one and all and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm worm my great army which I sent among you he permitted it not he sinned it has to be destructive but he permitted it to come forth all right to be in this day and you shall eat him plenty and be sent and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wonderfully with you my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed all right Hosea I told you it's in about six or eight times a former lot of rain in the scriptures but just picking out the ones that we you know want to read come and let us return unto the Lord for the for he has torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days he'll he revived us in the third days he after two thousand years we've done pice that two thousand year bracket so we're in the third day right all right so in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his side then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain untrue the earth and then now remember the kids all practice today's that all kids practice at 12:50 so remember that all right you may be seated while you're receiving all this turn to one more scripture that I want to read is in James in all this read it you don't have to turn there but he said be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord now once be patient unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman which is Almighty God right waited for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter right now is it for him or who is that he that's us that's us that's not he don't have to have rain he is the rain but we need the rain all right now I want to try to go real feist and if I get to face you slow me down a little but I want to hurry up and get something to you because I I've got about ten pages to just read okay not awful brother branham but parts or do it alright we're talking about what former and latter rain no in the natural you have that you have to have rain to our put rain or put water so when you plant your crop your your things you know tomatoes and and all like that especially find objects or different objects that has to be dug up planted but you put some waters are alright and that water is to make that plant boost forth alright you take a seed beans etc you put that in the ground it needs the moisture to quicken that seed to make it come alive alright so then we know that the rain is we'll read it in a minute is the Holy Spirit okay all right see then we need the rain upon the seed alright we covered it last Sunday there you know there the other day with the message cover and former and latter rain alright now I tried to emphasize to you heavily about the rain of what it is it's the Holy Spirit the you know I said some words are that you misunderstand me and all but I said like you know I said although this is the importance is not the rain now I went on to emphasize now I'm not talking about that you've got to have the seed first all right now water without the seed is no good seed without the waters no good all right so it's not making one greater the other it's emphasizing the point that it's very important which seed is planted because remember what we tried to cover that the the latter rain is going to produce whatever seed has been playing we'll read in a minute the Prophet said the Baptist has been planned to Methodist the Pentecostals etc are just going to produce that okay you say yeah but that's very deceiving for God to do that that's what he does he does it to see if you and I will be able to stay with the word all right get the message then anointed ones and study that we won't try to emphasize much other than the statement about it get the message or noted ones to where the rain falls on all all right it falls on the just and the unjust okay alright the same rain that makes your beam come up and grow will make the weeds come up and grow all right because if the the rain then is the moisture that we must have you know to the crops all right so then now here in the scripture of Hosea and it's talking about the restoration of the bride tree if you want to call it you know return of the years of the cankerworm pond warmed locust caterpillar and he says he'll send the FIR former rain he said he gave you former I'm moderately you know great in the form of rain all right then he says there as we read it that it would give you the former and latter rain in the same month well there's no no beans corn or anything that you can put a seed in the ground and and you know thirty days later you got corn or whatever it's emphasizing that something is going to happen all right now I want you to remember this part to keep in your mind brother Branham talks of like 200 and something quotes about former and latter rain alright now don't lose the point of interest to what we're trying to get see what's the point so that's what I'm aiming at all right he mentions former rain for Baptist latter rain former rain for the Pentecostal latter rain up and down all right coming throughout the message he's talking about he says we're having the latter right all right but then he finishes up in the spoken word his original Cedars will read in a minute he said you say you've had the latter end he says no that's that's not true he said cause the form of rain that come yet all right get the point the point is former rain is planting latter rain is harvest are gathering so no matter what you're talking about as will emphasize in a minute each church age had a former and latter rain it may be interesting if we can get to that part you know to express it all right let's see then don't don't that's what I'm saying when you're reading the message you're hearing the Prophet don't think he's only putting former and latter rain into the last days and you know that's knit down here but there's one thing this is very sure for this down here this is the age of the quick work quick word as the original says that word says he do a short work it means word he's going to pour in things Feist in the last day he spoke up in the church age book he said lady you'll see it would be a very short age all right now comparing to the other ages it is to be a very short age in time so God is going to do something here but don't misunderstand me when I bring and you'll see me come all the way up to here and then we get to laying on hard a former and latter rain in our day just remember that I've read and studied and I'll be glad to give you the quotes there laying on the table at the house of where brother Branham would be talking about former rain and he'd say we have had the latter right see there's a point that he was getting to it was right you know what when he said former rain and the Baptist former rain and the Methodists or whatever and he'd bring that out and he bring out two former rain in the Pentecostals and the latter rain he's right okay it's got to be place career li to be understood about it but what he's saying is right he doesn't come on later and say I was wrong back there about to rain no he gets the emphases of the point of the Pentecostals Worthen and I'm just laying this down in Rebecca the Pentecostals got into the move of God the gifts and the thing and they said they had to lie to rain all right now he says no he said you haven't had the former rain yet all right now what's he's got to be talking of a specific point or a thought all right so you got to get to the message to where this age has the the split condition I want to bring back the faith of the father all right then to go on and to front the prophets message to carry it on so watch that now and don't get lost and took what brother Dale don't understand because it's I don't where he's yeah brother Branham will call the babies having a lot of rain called any move of God is the Holy Spirit moving among those people and we'll get to it in a minute DC age did have a former and the latter rain never aged had it all right but then this age is going to pour in to cause it's gonna have to be returned to the faith of the Father's right 327 Church age book messenger new to thing and then it'll have to not only turn back to the hearts of father but he'll bring his message which is the revealing of the entire Word of God all right now because we know that it it's okay let's get to the point James says that the husbandman waiteth patiently in other words God has been patient with you and I waiting on us to come in the last days to understand okay all right now watch the former message because the former rain the teaching rain remember you're talking about rain but you're talking about the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the rain that you're talking about the move of God among us okay now we'll start and we'll read just a little while and then I'll drop back and try to finish the message by preaching it okay so go ahead and pull number one brothers and we'll get started cause I want to read some and then I want to drop back and get the message in and drive it hard to where we can see okay after the message anointed wanted to end time he said therefore the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth is the top of the spiritual rain which gives eternal life dropping down upon the church for we call it the former rain and the latter rain and it's a rain all right pouring out of God's Spirit upon his church what is the rain now remember former rain and latter rain is the same rain it's the same water it's just the position you're putting it in one of them is to start it the other one is to make it come to a harvest all right but it's the same rain okay now remember this as we'll try to get to it in a minute remember the rain doesn't change the seed that's why I emphasizing that message so much about the seed see the seed is the same that's why when the rain falls it's going to produce Baptist Methodist Presbyterian or Oliver randomizer it's going to produce it because the rain is what makes the crop cometh but remember you didn't plant all them weeds right but you got them all right and they'll be there so remember but remember the one thing now the water you pour own to the to the beam you put in the ground don't change it to a cocklebur it produces a beam but the cocklebur doesn't change and produce beans there's a cocklebur all right see whatever the seed you have and see why it's so important for us to follow the message to get it in the correct order one God to water baptism no eternal hell to the seals the thing all to have it perfectly laid down in order to were that we can see what God is going to quicken those he's going to quicken that he has planted all right now remember he didn't he didn't plant all the seed remember there's two seeds there one of them is the son of man stored in the seed but the other is the devil showing his seed all right but remember the same rain that makes the the week come up is the same rain that makes that disel or whatever you call it or different thing it'll make it come up - matter of fact it'll come up quicker all right yeah but then see what are we looking at what is the former rain in the latter Ryan it's a pouring out of God's Spirit for what it's doing okay and it's making manifest whatever seeds you plant so now this emphasize this in your thoughts hold this point in your mind that you're going to hopefully see today why things are so said by the Prophet a certain way to work that it will blind those who cannot understand now I say the Holy Spirit had him to say those things you know not that he planned to say them all right but it was just sit in a certain way God like I said you say former and latter rain well I know where he quoted here I've got these quotes here were former latter on with baton 54 well praise God that's right that's right the former rain and latter rain was in the days of Martin Luther John Wesley it was any church age it was all the way back forming latter rain would always back into the Old Testament watch that now as we get to it a minute but I want to read this part where you we're going to stay on your mind go to spoken word number two our excuse me number one that would one a go to number one which is spoken word as original seed 62 318 I believe it's near the harvest time the seeds been planted denominational seed of the churches now remember this I try to tell you something to help you remember this is 62 he's talking about the rain he's going to talk about the former in letter right and then he's gonna turn around and say you haven't had the latter rain okay he said because you haven't had the former that's what I said it in our minds we can get it so confused don't try to figure it out just listen like I said you say well brother Dale I've got a lot of quotes here we run around talking about former inliner right amen I just stated words me every church age has former lighter rain but then it's got to come to a short quick work in the last days okay now the seats been planted denominational seeds of the churches such as evangelist like Baptists and Presbyterians and Lutheran and the Pentecostal seeds been planted into the Pentecostal organization by great men like Oral Roberts Thomas heat Tommy Hicks Tommy Osburn great meaning of Godsey and I believe the Word of God has been planted unadulterated away from any of those organization sixty-two then he gets in the same message and says Malachi 4 ain't come here so he's talking about the Bible as far as man knew before you coming into the prophets message I've preached that I hope and at least lay in your mind enough to think alright look now watch what he said what's the matter the seed must have the seed plant must house seed water before it can grow they must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow now will you say brother branham there's been hour I know that's right catching your thought now and you see you just can't hide it they all right so be careful what you're thinking what were they thinking brother branham we're in the latter rain because that was the pentecostal move the idea we're in the latter rain he said okay you've had rain that's what he just said but watch him now he's picking up the thoughts of the people of what they're saying and the Pentecostals you Pentecostals know a number you come up through four you come up through latter rain but I run said they had all kind of range all right and see he thought that that and I'll read where brother Brennan said people thought that was the finishing up he said when it wasn't said the former hadn't even come well not so listen now the seed must be planted then it must have water in order to grow now you said well brother branham I'm going to express your thought thought dark we've had the water so be it that's correct you have had the water then he turned around says you ain't had to lie to rain what he's telling them that's right we'll get to that in a minute what produced in the days of 1906 the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and once you plant cabbage or anything the seeds or something nothing like that usually you got a water tower just pour a little on them see all right but now wait what did we have in that planting time the former rain oh you say brother branham nonsense in other words we've had the latter on you're talking about former Ryan that's why they couldn't understand him he was standing there telling them that their reign that they had was not what they thought it was right it was not the quickening to the going away they thought it was that's your Pentecostal people they still think that said then wait a minute you take the word former in Joel and look at it and see if the Hebrew word you go to the Hebrew and see if it know if you want to write it down he said mo you are eh Mora and get the Hebrew word interpret see what Mora means teaching the teaching rain has went forth the denominational teaching rain has went forth a million more than 44 Baptists so-and-so so-and-so members in the church Roy Roberts them brothers with the Pentecostal move the the economy you can never have said that word the great Pentecostal move they moved up until the millions that's right and the seed has went forth the word for the minority the group who's he told man himself this restoring of the faith of the fathers had been preached in 62 by the Prophet and remember the word Mora Mora means teaching the former ein that says that more rain the teaching run teaching rain went forward Billy Graham has struck the world the Pentecostal struck the world and the word has struck the world he had come in there and wedging in that faith of the father's he knew exactly where he was at what's the matter now it's now waiting for the letter right that's what you produces a fruit oh well I hope you get here then the kind of seeds you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you'll reap if it's a denomination wants more members that's what they're going to get that's what they have they remember they've gotten the Pentecostal move ever what I say a nice message it's going to produce you say Lateran run run said the latter rain will cover the earth it's not just latter rain for the bride only there's never been any thought that like that by the Prophet he's always brought you for my lighter rain form a lot of rain I mean when you get a form of rain remember there's going to be a ladder rain to follow that cuz why would you want to put a form of rain if you didn't do it all right they're gonna get what they've gotten the pentecostal wants more pentecostals that's what they're going to get right but the word is going to produce sons and daughters of God right now where's that supposed to be coming in a minute you put it down all right now listen go ahead to the next one someone asked him about the word you know former Ryan and all former and latter the word former is the Hebrew word Morra more which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest right now we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the harvest rain you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop growing then just before it matures there comes another crop that's what is called now remember it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain we've had we've had the heart would excuse me we've had the teaching rain and we're ready for the harvest rain then God corrects the man in his message and says that of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled in other words you haven't preached your message yet but see they were saying the Pentecostals even under brother Branham trying to bring the message that he was they were saying that they had to lie to Ryan he said no he said you haven't had a letter Ryan yet he say you know we've had a teaching run his message ain't even come into being yet but he's right he had to do the works all right come on let's see uh we found out it over all right let me just drop them to preach a little cause I've got a bunch of quotes there's one I wore especially though he said we've had the teaching rain that around go we'd better get number three well number three they resume with the church ages and he said this church agent started right after the turn of the century and it was any ages in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at penny calls now we believe that or not but that's what he said is going to take place we know that there must be necessity to be a return of the dynamic power the believer since this in their spirit and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration or Lateran at once it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring our teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come they said just a little bit for then we've done happier teaching right I mean they don't hit with you you don't read and listen you know read to try to get understanding right you've got to read it over and over why would a prophet Lee telling those Pentecostal people you've had rain you had water you had teaching tonight which said you haven't had the latter rain come on look what he's saying see they're saying right here in this period gap of time they say don't had ever he said the former which is the spring right the latter rain then is the harvest how could this be real the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the Prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers had not yet come they trying to tell those Pentecostal people you've had to move of God the works of God is among you the gifts is among you but yet you're saying latter right he said no he said you haven't even heard the farmer come on that's what was thought to be the restoration and the finala quickening unto the rapture had not come see they thought they've come the pinnacles this is it we're ready to go kind of reminds me of a lot of people in seventy two three and four that some of you older ones can remember when oh yes I told a dream that I'd have a little girl that would be about this tall and I told it in about nineteen seven then they said well you're gonna miss it cause rapture is coming in 73 okay I just tell the dream as a dream you know what I got the little girl she's a little bit bigger than that now but that's a little girl all right but you see the Pentecostals thought it was over that they had it all that's why you see it among the ministers of this message they don't want what brother Branham said they still want to move the goings the great things of great anointings I don't make light but they say well he was anointed look at him his shirt is wet you know thinking those are the things no the Pentecostals had you because they they wouldn't even wear short sleeves and they stayed wet but listen Church what are we doing this message is supposed to be the thing and that's what I'm trying to show you right in one message read it I've asked you to read spoken words of reason don't see how many of yous ready don't in a few hands ninety-eight percent didn't raise their hand okay listen and the spoken word original seat brother branham brought his message and he preached the pure unadulterated word in the city that struck the world but then something happened and he said something's wrong God told him to go back he rewrote it brought it back down and God told him you can read it right outspoken original seated in them and the church age will brought him right back to his message right to the same place and when he got to that place he said what am I gonna do Lord he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled that's 1962 we thought Malachi 4 fulfilled in the fifties sixties one not he said it was what are we going to believe him our our our own ideas listen look what brethren said about Azusa Street that's what was thought to be the restoration and to finally quickening unto the rapture had not come in it was a mixture what is this the street of the unrighteous for taking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of the devil yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before the second generation had appeared organized and wrote their own scriptural doctrines and built their own fences as ever other group ahead of them done now you tell me that ain't happening to people this message I want to give you about an hour message on it okay you think it all already happened that they've done the sign thing in this message unscriptural yeah go ahead to number four better read these if I don't get all arrested like spoken word to regional city and what we're trying to do they're trying to manufacture a lot of rain nonsense they said nonsense on that quote while ago about him he's saying nonsense back right while the latter rain will sweep the world the latter rain was weak the world I'm better Dale I thought you said the other day that you believed in a revival coming but there was not going to be a world wide sweeping revival they won't be but the latter rain will sweep the world they will sweep the world now that's what he's saying so go ahead rather been a former rain sawing words that's right now you see what the latter rain producer now you'll see what you find out darl be an affiliation the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to you it won't even be allowed to open your mouth right that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you will see a rain oh my they still be quiet yeah he's not coming until the pressure comes yet we've got all this he's there he's there is he come in 63 and he was here and he's done this and he's got all of those things he said the Lord's gonna come when they start closing our doors well we've been a long time and ain't closed them yet don't you worry about it they're getting everything ready and then it'll fall I tried my best to tell you years ago what there's gonna take place experienced it and seen it when they broke in this front door up here the old door came in and when the little brother come in sit down here with us and fellowship with us for a few months and you talking about a spiritual crying weeping man every service he was in the altars crying and crying and screaming out to God I walked up to him one day I said brother I said something's telling me that you're a government agent that has come in here to check us out he just froze stiff he never blinked he never moved I said just do a good job I said don't tell no lies on us I said report it like it is tell it like it is and I said I'm telling you I won't tell nobody for awhile he come on the church for a few weeks then he left he went down to Church in Atlanta going on down in that away I never told my wife for three months I was embarrassed to tell anybody I'm illustrating you know how wonderful sweet blessing brother Tatum was that I mean you could just say Jesus and he descried and just worshiping her that man had him beat ten to one he stayed in the older more and he did anything else but yet something told me I went told him now I told you there the other day something that the Lord had showed me was you listening they ain't putting signs on these churches anymore that says this is a Baptist Church they're putting some kind of a shallow or this that or the other they're putting some kind of a name on them they're not they're taking down their Baptist names they'll take it down their methodist name they're putting up these all kind of names worship center but right here what are you looking for go ahead number five stealing smoking words regional seed this is in the evening service look God has promised be careful God has promised from Ellicott for for this life stays and melikhaya for has not yet has been fulfilled does that been fulfilled that's what God told him get the message read the book and then when the Prophet puts it they put it in there what the Lord told him to rewrite Lord told him a Malachi four hadn't been fulfilled he thought it had he thought he'd preach the seals he did in 57 or somewhere long didn't re preach the under seal he thought all that was done that's why I was telling them brothers but then when this message came it brought him alive that's why I said to you the prophets message beginning some wording to save 62s and lasted for three and a half years listen and Malachi for has not yet has been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled first the drummer Ty's work spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it to be just before their coming across a second time and then it comes to the scriptures of the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible what's how perfect that man's understanding was read that next statement the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrived of course he'll plant the seed of the entire Bible what's he plumb from the serpent that's Genesis right to the messenger in the former rain looks like he would have said latter rain of cause at that time the Adam sold the former so it's going to come this man that's come on the scene is going to what bring us the word plant the entire Bible from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain What did he say into our Bible and say it like that it looks like it's going to be an addition those seals were not an added thing to the Bible but it was a no man know anything about it long church then he'll be rejected by denominational people that's just for fun it's on the larger word what about it go ahead let's see when I roll up back down cuz we're missing part maybe a little bit yeah this is it Melek i3 planted a former rain and was rejected by the churches the denomination the fire season of Sadducees and his day Melek aah tree planted a former right watch that in a minute as we pick it up the Pharisees know Jesus came who introduced Jesus Malachi 4 but Malachi 3 had planted a former rain and was rejected by the churches well he gets missed they should have been Malachi for that you go do what you want to ain't listening to you Jesus came and had to mount Transfiguration showdown this forerunner of the last day who's he Malachi 4 will so for the former rain he's exactly writing a statement of here to the messenger to former right Jesus will be the showdown between denominations increase which is his word when he comes a showdown the rapture of his bride we're not gonna go out her fight on a work less Carter I can just see that Battle of Armageddon we just listen the rapture is gonna prove what's right listen the first was Mount Carmel Elijah Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration Jesus in Matthew 17 transfigured look and the third will be Mount Zion rapture now Zion rapture okay now now hang on a minute with him go ahead and clear that off because we ain't gonna be using the board for a little bit I want you to think about former and latter rain Iowa straighted it the life service and I'll illustrate the good bit now that former rain is teaching rain the right ladder rain is more like harvest rain or gathering rain or whatever and you see you you put your water on to get it to plant to multiply you know i'll reproduce and start it grow then you need rain all the way through but then when you come to the lice you need a good rain right if they the older ones is here you say well I thank God for that in Chennai for rain we got like not that'll be enough make my garden produce you know because you know you having the life rain you're gonna get because it's going to start drying up all right now but the outpouring of the Spirit of God is that rain whether it be former rain Lateran whether it be Cornerstone faith or a headstone it's the same door Jesus Christ the rain is the same it's just according to whatever is to produce okay now if I can read my own notes so listen very carefully as we start something and watch now listen I'm trying to instruct you all right watch each thing be the same when we get it and especially the ages you'll see what happened in the first age happens in the sixth and eighth happens in the third age happens in the fourth age happens in the fifth age happens in the sixth age and then something special happens in the seventh so just remember that and listen so I just wrote down this point there's always to be in scriptural matters a former on a ladder Ryan because if God ever brings a form of rain he was going he is going to bring the ladder right that's a promise because he won't leave it said my word won't return unto me boy all right now each time God moves they'll get this thought each time God moves it'll be a former and a ladder a former and a lighter every time he moves will be that so get that thought in your mind I wrote down do you understand remember the form of rain is the pouring out of the out of God up on the church to bring the church and start it latter rain will be a harvest rain or quickening to the rapture so let's back up there was a man came on the scene back there one time the Old Testament was coming to an end and there's that Old Testament was coming to an end you can go by performing a lot of running back through all of that but we're just picking up at that point as the Old Testament was coming to an end and the New Testament coming into being what took place it wasn't Jesus just stepping out there and I'm definitely know he had to have an introducer he had to have someone to forerun him John the Baptist forerun the coming of the Lord Jesus and proclaimed and said behold the lamb of God john 1:29 or 2080 Rodina behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he introduced the Messiah now listen his message was to introduce the Messiah okay he priest a former rain are you listening if you sleepy wake up don't try to write too much today either cuz you're gonna get behind all right you'll get to tape and replay it and I ask you but you're not gonna do it so then you're gonna lose and then you're gonna say I said something I didn't say and then when you do we're gonna get bleh and I'm gonna say it's been said I said so in tone I didn't say it here's the tape we're gonna play it because I've tried to drive to get you to listen so at least if you listen it work alright John's message was to introduce the Messiah it was more than just introduced the Messiah it was to turn the Old Testament away from that Old Testament form and pointing it toward the New Testament now are you listening toward the New Testament that message that John was a former rain behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world was the former rain he was to bringing in brethren city was a keystone standing between the old and new Testament all right now going on to Jesus Christ so don't misunderstand see he introduced Jesus Christ then Jesus Christ was the latter rain - what John had preached are the production of the seed that John had planted and produced are you in me the Lord Jesus when John said to behold the lamb of God there he stood what God alive in human flesh the Living Word was standing upon the earth there's your latter rain it was ready to be harvested but there was so much more to be left that wasn't finished alright see then Jesus and I try to hurry it up and I'm trying to figure that feistner see then Jesus turned around and he preached the message he had a former Ryan a teaching rain priest his whole message for three and a half years with the disciples the disciples heard that word and believed it went to Pentecost and Pentecost quickened that word they see the answer to John's message wasn't coming for the Lord's either the answer to Jesus's message was they people that would come forth to be the body of Jesus Christ see then John's message was what produced the Lord Jesus see the former rain produced the ladder you get the former you're going to automatically get the ladder it's not that you did he he breaks down and forgets about us no huh so let's follow the example throughout the word John introduced Jesus that was his message Jesus was the latter rain to his message Jesus preached the message to the disciples they had to go to Pentecost and wait for the Holy Ghost to fall which was the latter rain and listen they had heard the word and then the latter rain the Holy Spirit fell on the day of Pentecost to make alive what they had heard all right so it produced a lot of rain season Pentecost the the word that they heard was made alive it became the latter rain are the word quickened by the Spirit of God to make that a rain for them a harvest or collecting when I'm using harvest until it gets in the last days remember run around and use harvest so harvest doesn't mean that it was over with that guard it means a collecting and getting ready for the next could listen alright then the disciples what's their message the disciples in their former reign teach to the people the faith of the father's the stature of a perfect man the Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone build on the foundation apostles prophets Jesus Christ all right you follow what I'm saying John preached the message Jesus was the ladder to that former Jesus preach the message of disciples was the latter aim to that are the Living Word Living Word just in Jesus was the Living Word with standing that stands a bride the living word and as she does she has a message the book of Acts she brought the faith of the father she began to teach it it was answered with the book of Acts acts of the Holy Ghost in the church which was the latter rain to what those disciples begin to preach all right the word was made alive and that become the body of Jesus Christ which was the book of acts are the alive word the latter rain to the former that the disciples had preached an alive word and the people he listened to it all the way down you see it tie right in what way talking about because you've got your your white horse rider it was the people red horse rider it was the people black horse rider it was the people then would say brother branham eagle Lorenz City just come to make way for the Eagles we don't listen and once as we start to Church ages watch it the Apostle Paul standing at the ending up of the book of Acts remember your messenger coming to you the aged paul standing there proclaim the message to the first church at ephesus the people believe that message and as they believe that message it became a latter rain to what Paul had preached or a quickening or a making alive of that word see it becomes a lot of rain the proof that it was the word then remember there's going to be another age to come I'm having a skillet but this get it see what happened with her disciples produced what happened with Paul Paul coming out from the book of Acts took his message to the first church age his message was the former rain the people making that message alive became latter rain people are a live word out of that now listen and watch the connection and the star steps if you see the Statue of a perfect man watch the star steps once you step up and your messenger comes the end of the age sure what Paul brought started pulling down and going down but remember they were still enough they're alive word until out from that out from Paul's message that had been brought in the face of the Father come Iranian Iranian priest his message of the age for his time and as he did what happened the people become alive with the word and they stayed alive enough until it come out for what now if I get them wrong you kick me alright Paul Irene yes Martin right Martin was produced by Paul and I radius if you're listening because they he was the word he was the alive word the original spoke original seat brother unsaid lie stood about for ages then it started more going into the ground don't worry about it going into the ground cards gonna come out whatever coat is not over Martin stood on the word and preached his message he stood on what he had from Paul and him and brought his message and when he did God answered that were the people that made it alive and from that people that made it alive walked out a man me Martin the rest said there was no greater than Martin of all the messengers it was no greater he said they never had a service they didn't have a signs and wonders of taking plush you see you're lonely looking at dying dying dying I'm not I've never looked like that see Martin when he brought his message he made sure his message was right with our reneus and Paul and the book of Acts and John and Jesus his message was alive not a dead letter but a live man walking out a messenger coming forth now what's you at the ending up with that age of Martin message your country in the age here comes Columba ever how you pronounce the Columba come by everywhere you want to pronounce it here he comes for stepping out upon what Paul and all them had preached and he brought his message which bound together are showed exactly the same God Paul preached same God Iranians proof the same god Martin please there stood Columba was the same message and the people made that alive that was the thousand years of dark ages then that struck right into that period of time and as it began to die and going to the ground it looked rough but God had already promised it from Columbus message of former rain when he ended up his life it produced a man called Martin Luther Martin Luther was already a convert converted he was a monk in a monastery he wasn't just somebody went down joined him monastery he was already a Christian he was already you know claiming to be in Christ and being saved and everything and all that wants the message struck in from work Paul said to just shall live by faith when Martin Luther stepped out of there with that message to sow that seed of the just shall live by faith into that fifth age it was a former rain as he brought it but as the people received it to become lighter rain to them are in a live word of quickening a harvest was there for each age you know what it produced I said you're gonna have to hold a home because you see it was Luther's message that produce Wesley you went with me for a while and then you drop now so you dropped also you know you drop you went where you were kind of looking and saying that's a good point that Paul brought his message and I reneus stepped right out on Paul's message Martin stepped right out on our eNOS come on we'll step right out on now don't go to sleep on me and pretend you asleep when you're sitting there in your head trying to figure out where I'm going just listen is it the Word of God that you just shall live by faith we realized then that when the messenger coming at the end of the age at the end of that age as Columbo was it was ending up Martin Luther walked on the scene and preached his message former reign of the just shall live by faith the people took that and made it alive and as they made that message alive it became to them a ladder rain or connection or a harvest and a man walked right out of there out of all of that Catholicism's all of that problems walk out a man called John Wesley John Wesley said I come to America to convert to Heath and found out I need to be converted myself Martin Luther preached his message West Nick step right up with sanctification all right what happened next Wesley got the message of sanctification he sold a former reign of sanctification because they ain't no messenger can give you anything the Holy Ghost is the only reviewer of the word I didn't say that your prophet said it if you want that quote be glad to find it a Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the you know who the messenger at each age were do you want this it was the Holy Ghost but it was in a man right but see you out of Luther's message come walked out Wesley out of Wesley's message come walked out I get it in here somewhere were veteran lucinda justification produced sanctification sanctification - baptism when the Holy Ghost and then the word all right now listen so as John Wesley will come forth and preached his message former Ryan what was the answer to John Wesley's message messenger comes the end of the age at the end of Wesley's age the Wesley come the end of Luther's age come on we got him laying here at the end of Wesley's age came Azusa Street Azusa Street Azusa Street was the latter rain to Wesley's message of sanctification justification makes work for sanctification sanctification makes way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got him laying here I don't preach without stuff laying in front so come up later and ask me where you want I got him laying right here you got the notes you've got the notes on it you come forth with Azusa Street my brother random says it so we got him laying here the masterpiece he's a justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism with the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself that's 1964 but see that's where the key that brother Branham comes in at to explain but we don't want to read these questions and answers go ahead with number 7 we'll start reading a little bit questions and answers on the seals justification that's leave that one where they can read it justification is a work of the Holy Spirit saying if occasional work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism okay that's that's this question that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age so you don't want to have you think that's destroying brother Branham no way come on reading it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the aged brother branham was not the messenger to lady of seal come on we got the quote we'll read it in a minute what did he say on the message feast of the trumpet they come with a message of penico if I come with a message of Pentecost it would be in the lady you see in church age and it wouldn't be right but seeds we don't want to read that because it blows our mind we well how can we get to okay that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet you say a prophet holy ghost came he is the prophet whose overseas with a man he asked me what I thought about what he presented and I answered it I said first off you're trying to make brother branham to be come to John on Patmos and I said I don't agree with that I said why were you just respect all the other prophets and not allow all of it you may believe brother Branham come to John on Patmos but I don't I believe it was the Holy Ghost that come to John on Patmos it was the Prophet I said why you want to degrade it off why don't you make that and it won't come to John on Patmos be the Holy Ghost God Himself the prophet he hadn't talked to Miss Minchin I don't mean that talk to me and talk to him about half all right see that's reading it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger of the age because the Holy Ghost came himself and the fullness of the baptism Holy Ghost come on a Sutra Street in the fullness of the baptism now brother showing so that cannot preach era said that Azusa Street in all was false I told him I didn't agree with it till he said it right here I don't agree with it I believe what he said okay because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism were susurrus true watch now you said well Widow but at the end of the age that it's always ends upon two others we find our then the messenger sent and all these scruples and things are to be placed in their places like that then the rapture for the church yeah no messenger to the age where the number eight which is the first seal we explained the messenger to the age but let the Prophet explain the messengers come Paul coming to end of the age we find out that Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age Luther into the Catholic aides watching and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age can you read the what and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me to not to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all of those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rat string of the church who was the messenger to Azusa Street the Holy Ghost okay wait a minute I'll give it to you okay go to number 10 got number 10 which is God's only provided place of worship now the Pentecostals that brother I believe his one of his eyes was out a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California old Azusa Street he was laughed at because he was a Negro he was made fun of but he brought the message for that age just a little body a fella could hardly sign it own name but the Lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of the gifts and they come no matter what said it come who's the messenger to Azusa Street said no brother Brennan said no messenger of the aged he's because the Holy Ghost came himself well you're making another man knowing there's seven men in the statute of perfect man but there's eight manifestations of God now we'll tie brother run him into that if you want to go all the way but let's just get the rest of what we're doing where did we get to okay Wesley caught the message of sanctification and he preached that message to the people there was the former rain the people became the message that he had preached and their zeal a terrain are the quickening the harvest to prove it out of our walk John Wesley John Wesley believed what Paul what Luther had preached but he knew there was more to it so he stepped forth with his message what a former rain day and a message of Wesley and what comes from that if you following me I'm getting you to look at the people that's in each age the people is the one that's a live word time to get you to see what you are not if don't say nothing go ahead what you see when Azusa Street started off that colored man with a one eye Seymour's and all that come down through what was the other one daddy daddy seemed over that his name of it and it Heywood and all they come you ought to go to Jamaica and go over there and listen to those people of oneness their oneness but they know whatever scripture did I tried to bring the only thing they backed up in Fire Services was when I brought out Melchizedek and who he was they've never seen that and they just kind of it just went through and I had to explain it because they've never seen whom else editing book comes even Almighty God he's the one talking about so Azusa Street with the gifts and a DC morning him the oneness doctrine Azusa Street was Pentecostal of a Pentecostal group was actually Trinitarians most of you probably don't even know that Azusa Street was Trinitarians out of there came the oneness through Seymour and all of them bringing out the oneness doctrine and the oneness doctrine had come back and the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ had already been started using before brother Branham stepped on the same Ridge of history or at least read bread around him you hear so what happened the people become what the messenger on the day of his oosa Street had brought and they become a lot of rain to that out of there stepped a man that had a special work we just read he preached the faith of the fathers until he saw it statue of perfect man he preached it to bring it to the people that was the former rain the teaching rain of the Prophet in the early ministry and then the latter rain - that was a people that began to believe it and from the hour step forth the life's messenger of the messengers okay then brother Branham LAN listen and I got to finish it up brother Branham then was the latter rain to everything that had been brought him and his message now not him no no we're not Tara it's the message his message was the latter rain his message begun in the opening of the seals and the things they're after before then it was work of restoration his message was not a restoration his message listen listen careful his message was the words spoken from the lips of a man that had never been understood before in all the Bible it had never been understood it stepped from a man's lips he became the messenger the Malik of Malachi for produce a prophet Malachi for was just to return the faith of the fathers spoken words original seed if you'll read it you'll get it but you're not going to read it cause you don't wonder sand it you want to stay in you're black you're black and out situation to where you're at and be justified in your own thoughts well what do you think the reason we're here 50 years after the problem but I taught this 50 years ago season brother branham step forth from all of those things back back behind and brought his message starting in 63 some were 62 into life's one in 63 three and a half years and see the people has got to become that message or there's no ladder rain to his message do you understand me if there's not a ladder rain I've got it written in here and I got a quote from the Prophet if that latter rain don't take place your former was wrong you better get serious if this message don't produce Jesus Christ then we've all missed it see as John preached and Jesus became the latter rain we see in the latter days that produces Street people preach the message and the Prophet stepped out on that then he went to had to connect to the faith of the fathers and get that so down completely the word a word would be correct and those seals can't be something different from the statue of a perfect man and the things of the before then that's why I differ with these brothers that say brother Branham was corrected and here later he changed his doctrine come and show me but see you don't want to hear that well why don't some of you people out there that's listening to what I'm saying why don't you go to your pastor and tell him that and why don't you get him by the NAP of the next they're seen in the britches and bring him here no you ain't gonna do it because you're scared of them your soul is the most important thing that could ever be yet you won't fight for your soul I'm fighting for mine with everything that I've got I'm trying my best to get you to see like illustrating it out of one age it produced another age out of that age produced another age out of that produced another out of that produced another and it when it comes to this life stage it produced Azusa Street with the messenger being the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost could put forth in a profit and start preaching back to the faith of the fathers and get back to the faith of the father's then his message could open Co that's what he said on spoken word originally he said yet Lord something's wrong I've preached my heart out I preached the faith of the father appreciate right and what's wrong he said Milliken for a fool for you so melikhaya for had another part right what was the two parts that we've always been quoting 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 30 whatever it says will grow to two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the faith to the Father to reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back read it the Prophet brought a message that's to stand between time and eternity now what did brother Branham say that he came to do you can talk about faith afar but what about this quote that the product this prophet would be pointing to the skies - a word born bride that the coming of Jesus Christ see you and I've got to be a lot of rain now listen don't go haywire because this latter rain will take us to a harvest there is not another one coming we've reached the end of all things the prophet has brought his message the people become here message and as they become his message then they go forth okay let's get one more go ahead go ahead number 11 let's get to number 11 which is 340 ladies in church hmm okay that comes down get the whole thing over set down to the church a Giunta thing and when it comes to Wesley the voice of the word and the people and the revelation of God didn't watch what it comes up and their God raised up others and so he has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age now I didn't say that don't get upset with me cause I found it the bride is to be the final voice no brought around final voice read what he said this last day people is another people in the life laying under there messenger can only bring what their messenger brow what I said go home type into your computer former and latter rain now you may have to type in former and latter rain then you have to type in ladder you know what type it in and see how many times brother around spoke of former and latter rain and how that he spoke of down through the ages and how he brought it up to Azusa Street and said they had the word and he stepped right out and brought the message you see we've got to make a live we've got to make a live what he brought if not there is no latter rain now you want to stay a little while and let me quote one more why is the latter rain withholding in the last day who's got two scripts why is the latter rain withholding nobody's saying nothing so I mean don't don't blame me later come oh well I knowed what it was I just didn't wanna show you up don't worry about it Kota I can't even remember what it is myself they just come to me but I know it's Bible it says thou hast a forehead you ever heard that one and because of that the rain has been withholding I'll find that for you some of them your computer's running it Feist because that's the scripture thou has the horse for what's the horse for head the denominational holder prostitute systems are your ideas in mind contrary to the word thou hast a forehead said dar by the rain has been withholding what about it your brother Dale you just throw everything to us too hard I might've said the other day said how long are you gonna be on this series there's 40 something sermons on the life-size I'm gonna try not to do two minutes but I'll preach to you understand now if there's any questions then you come with the questions we'll have a whole series of questions but I want one face line through to where you'll understand now listen John spoke it Jesus became it Jesus spoke it's each one former lines rather Jesus spoke it the disciples became it Paul spoke it the people became it brought into Iranian smart and kahlúa out in all and come to this last days that this messenger is to turn us back or have a harvest rain are the Prophet said rapture in faith where'd he say the rapture fate lays in these books and tapes in these books and tapes what do we need something else for what if brother if we could ever get have you heard that brother so in some old man he's on fire thank God for some better home fire thank God hang on throw off on him I'm just gonna asked what are they bringing is it to help you and me to understand who we are to be or is it still just trying to prove brother branham was a prophet I think we ought to know that let's tan that's just saying I love him anybody has a need you have a question about anything I say you asked me I'll be glad to tell you or tell you don't mind anybody have a need be calm ether love but Ron who said so you don't listen well Ron said here comes a former rain with a lighter rain on it wouldn't follow that watch him he said here comes the latter rain with a former on it that's done gone we didn't get it but if you look at it or what I've been trying to bring former and latter rain now that's one word you realize if God spoke to you today and reveal to you something I say it that's a former rain teaching it's been a quickening of the latter to you but see tomorrow that become former that that you hear today and make manifest today tomorrow is a former you may not follow that line but that's true that's why to me encouraging to just keep moving straight forward take every day as it comes and say thank you God that was a lot of the form of rain to reveal that to me I see it tomorrow you try to explain it to somebody and you know you say it's done gone from you so much you can't explain it right what you saw one day the next day it's a former because there's a ladder to everyday father we thank you we ask you to just bless us and we go eat a natural meal bring us back together and you forgive our sins and lead us keep us in your love in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed you
