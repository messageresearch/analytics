[12:15] you in Jesus name
[12:17] amen
[12:19] Revelations
[12:21] 1-1
[12:27] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[12:29] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[12:31] things which must shortly come to pass
[12:34] and he said and signified it by his
[12:36] Angel unto his servant John
[12:39] so by record of the word of God and of
[12:41] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[12:44] things that he saw blessed is he that
[12:46] readeth and they that hear the words of
[12:48] this prophecy who keep those things
[12:50] which are written therein for the time
[12:54] is at hand out into first Peter 1. verse
[12:59] 9. through 13.
[13:02] receiving the end of yourself your faith
[13:05] even the salvation of your souls of
[13:08] which salvation the prophets have
[13:09] inquired and searched diligently who
[13:12] prophesy of the grace that should come
[13:13] unto you searching what are what manner
[13:17] of time the spirit of Christ which is
[13:19] was in them did signify when it
[13:22] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[13:24] Christ and the glory that should follow
[13:26] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[13:29] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[13:31] the things which are now reported unto
[13:34] you
[13:34] by them that have preached the gospel
[13:37] unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
[13:40] from heaven
[13:41] which things the Angels desired
[13:44] desire to look into wherefore gird up
[13:46] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[13:49] to the end for the grace that is to be
[13:51] brought unto you at the revelation of
[13:55] Jesus Christ you may be seated Lord
[13:58] that is blessing to the reading of the
[14:00] word
[14:01] now remember the thought of our message
[14:03] this morning
[14:09] this book
[14:11] that we're going to speak on this
[14:12] afternoon is the revelation of Jesus
[14:15] Christ
[14:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[14:20] all right so then there must be things
[14:23] within the book
[14:25] that you know is taking some time to
[14:28] come to the position to understand to be
[14:31] able to
[14:33] receive and to walk into
[14:36] it took the prophet dose the times and
[14:40] all culture he didn't understand
[14:42] everything when he started and he kept
[14:44] unfolding to him and he kept preaching
[14:46] what he could see
[14:48] and we saw that it was the the right
[14:52] hand of God is the power of God
[14:55] during Revelations 5 1 where we're
[14:58] reading and we'll read in a minute and
[15:01] get started again but you know we've
[15:04] seen that it was the right hand
[15:07] he had to book in his right hand
[15:09] it wasn't in the left hand
[15:13] right
[15:14] so it was in the right hand for a
[15:16] meaning and then the right hand means
[15:19] power and authority
[15:21] so then he was raised to the right hand
[15:24] and we read the scriptures are this
[15:26] morning that it was the right hand that
[15:28] raised into that position
[15:31] the power of God brought Jesus Christ
[15:34] unto the position to be able to uh you
[15:38] know sit on that throne and to be able
[15:41] to see and understand uh the the point
[15:44] of what's doing the it's not a great big
[15:47] right hand it means power and authority
[15:51] all right then we ended up speaking
[15:55] about
[15:57] that that Authority
[15:59] is now in the hands of the Bride of
[16:03] Jesus Christ all right now so what about
[16:07] the authority now this this was a point
[16:10] I was trying to get across here Jesus
[16:12] said all power in Heaven and Earth is
[16:14] given unto me
[16:15] well then word as we quote them this
[16:18] morning and all the talking about it
[16:20] because you ought to know these quotes
[16:21] that run around and said then where is
[16:23] your any other God see if there is to be
[16:27] powerless right right no Jesus said all
[16:30] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[16:31] him well now brother you just don't
[16:33] understand that the father gave so much
[16:36] and the Holy Ghost gave so much and put
[16:38] it all to Jesus look you know you just
[16:40] don't understand either so that's the
[16:42] main problem all right see that would
[16:46] bring in too many people and too many
[16:47] thoughts
[16:48] and you know and uh you know like we
[16:51] talk about we don't believe in Eternal
[16:53] son of ship
[16:54] because how could a son be Eternal but
[16:58] we do believe in eternal godship
[17:01] Jesus with almighty God made manifest in
[17:04] flesh all right and then when he raised
[17:08] from the dead he said all power is given
[17:10] unto me
[17:12] and then he turned right around and gave
[17:13] that power back to the church
[17:15] now he had already while he was here see
[17:18] I didn't have time to bring the message
[17:21] but while he was here he even unliving
[17:24] he gave the disciples power
[17:27] don't go out preach the gospel cast out
[17:30] Devils heal the sick Etc and all like
[17:32] that and and they wound up in trouble
[17:34] you remember with the uh epileptic child
[17:37] that they couldn't
[17:39] um
[17:40] cast out the demon and he said it was
[17:43] because of their unbelief not because of
[17:44] the power right now I've had a quote
[17:48] there this morning that I should have
[17:49] read I'm sure but right around says in
[17:52] other words if God ever gives you
[17:53] anything
[17:55] he can't take it back
[17:59] that's right now that's that's just as
[18:01] much as we can be if he gives you
[18:03] something
[18:04] and you say well I had this but you know
[18:07] God took it back no God didn't take it
[18:09] back that's right that's right you see I
[18:12] used to be able to do this and be able
[18:14] to do that but God took it away from me
[18:16] now don't get tied up with what brother
[18:18] Brown was saying when he said that that
[18:20] God took that gift away from him for
[18:22] about five years because that can happen
[18:25] that's in ministries and and doings I'm
[18:28] talking about salvation or the power of
[18:30] almighty God living in our life it was
[18:33] the fact that he had you know uh he had
[18:36] wronged God and and not followed the way
[18:38] he was supposed to and God took away
[18:40] what was that part all right let's see
[18:44] the power and authority
[18:47] the right hand is now in The Bride of
[18:50] Jesus Christ
[18:52] because when you see him he's in the
[18:53] seven in chapter one of Revelation you
[18:57] see him in the midst of the seven golden
[18:58] candlesticks like unto the son of man
[19:01] dirt about the pouch for the golden
[19:03] girdle see that puts all of God there
[19:06] in that form and we believe that that
[19:09] the the thing that the prophet said all
[19:11] God was he poured into Christ oh Christ
[19:14] was he pours into the church all right
[19:16] so then that makes us part of the
[19:19] mystery
[19:20] and makes us with that same power you
[19:22] say well but I just don't see it well
[19:24] that's where the trouble is the trouble
[19:27] is is we're not looking correctly
[19:29] we're looking for something to happen
[19:32] we're looking for another Prophet to
[19:35] come or or somebody to come out with
[19:37] gifts and signs and wonders and I've
[19:39] told you over and over
[19:42] I preached this from day one here to
[19:44] church probably 40 over 40 years
[19:47] I believe
[19:49] that no person one person can have the
[19:52] ministry of Jesus Christ again like
[19:54] brother Brown had it one person
[19:57] I do not believe in it because it's not
[19:59] promised but I do believe that the Bride
[20:02] of Jesus Christ that it's promised to
[20:05] her around the world
[20:07] I mean I emphasize that around the world
[20:10] that is promised to her to her that the
[20:14] fullness of the godhead bodily would be
[20:16] in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen right
[20:19] see then you say but I just don't see it
[20:21] within that's making you the unbeliever
[20:24] and if you've been here where Jesus was
[20:26] here you would have been the same time
[20:29] no no I'd have believed if I hear what
[20:32] you now you're a liar because brother
[20:35] sorry
[20:37] but that's blame but it's true right
[20:39] that's right see we think it's supposed
[20:42] to change things because we could
[20:44] somebody else could be here all right
[20:46] see David The Killing Goliath was only
[20:49] to get the people
[20:52] they're fighting their own battle yes
[20:53] right right
[20:55] run around came to show us what God
[20:58] would do in any individual that would
[21:01] believe him
[21:03] they were not to deal with the ministry
[21:07] but we're to deal with the same God
[21:09] that's right because the same God has
[21:12] got to be in the ministry around the
[21:13] world
[21:14] all right we see it all ties up and
[21:17] makes one true and living God all right
[21:19] so then we see that the power and
[21:22] authority of almighty God is in the hand
[21:26] of the one sitting on the throne
[21:30] all right cause that is his hand right
[21:32] that's his power there's you Seven Stars
[21:35] there's a whole of the church age
[21:38] Messengers and God you know doing all
[21:41] tied up bringing it down to sin Jesus
[21:44] Christ the same yesterday today and
[21:46] forever
[21:47] all right now remember that we kept
[21:50] emphasizing
[21:52] the fact that Revelations 5 of The
[21:54] Prophet said
[21:56] is a scene preparing
[22:01] for the opening of the seals
[22:04] all right preparing
[22:06] I kept talking about that and kept over
[22:08] and over talking about it
[22:11] you're preparing for a wedding
[22:14] you spend days weeks months
[22:17] getting ready for one little event
[22:20] you know
[22:22] it ties up maybe two hours of your day
[22:25] but yet you've
[22:27] prepared for it for six months or more
[22:30] you know getting everything ready well
[22:33] then when the day comes that's where I
[22:35] like the point see that when the wedding
[22:37] comes
[22:38] you know and when that bride steps in
[22:41] that door back there to come down the
[22:43] altar you really literally supposed to
[22:45] lock the door
[22:49] man where those lazy bunch of shiftless
[22:51] bums they can't get here on time
[22:55] but they think the world evolves around
[22:57] them
[22:59] and they're in a puffed up manner you
[23:01] know look closed the door on me if you'd
[23:04] have got here before the time of the
[23:05] Bride coming down
[23:09] sorry
[23:11] I'm playing
[23:12] but is that true true
[23:15] well now you don't understand
[23:21] I like you talk like that
[23:24] or what if you was the bride right
[23:26] that's right
[23:28] and what if you was the Grim
[23:32] do you understand
[23:35] if I was the groom and my wife being the
[23:38] bride I wouldn't care if it was my
[23:40] Mother and Daddy
[23:42] it didn't get there I wouldn't stop the
[23:44] wedding to let them come in
[23:47] you know why because God ain't gonna
[23:49] stop it for those Teddy little females
[23:51] of our order
[23:52] one of these days the door is going to
[23:55] be closed and it don't matter what we
[23:58] think about it that's right that's right
[24:00] it's going to be on Amen so what if you
[24:03] were surprised
[24:06] when somebody comes in the door I'd like
[24:09] to have a seat
[24:11] you give him one swift kick in the seat
[24:16] to send him on his way why
[24:19] because this is a serious matter
[24:22] we're talking about reality
[24:26] I'm not talking about your petty
[24:28] feelings that's right
[24:32] listen
[24:36] now if you've caught on to something
[24:40] I told you we would get into Revelations
[24:41] 5.
[24:43] and I made statements along the way to
[24:46] help you
[24:46] write them down
[24:49] and be ready
[24:50] because according to the prophet
[24:52] Revelations 5 is a background or a
[24:54] preparing
[24:56] for chapter six to come into being of
[24:58] the opening of the seals right right
[25:01] I'll emphasize that over and over and
[25:03] over
[25:04] we got to be in the right place
[25:05] everything's available in position
[25:07] all right now you don't see
[25:13] once you see it in in what you see in
[25:17] chapter four is there a manifested in
[25:19] chapter five
[25:22] of the one sitting on the throne
[25:25] but it doesn't emphasize the throne and
[25:28] the things as much as it emphasizes the
[25:31] one that's sitting on the throne
[25:34] the right hand
[25:36] the power
[25:39] all right
[25:40] the authority
[25:43] and also
[25:46] there's a book in hand
[25:51] another one sitting on the throne and
[25:53] remember it's in the right hand it's not
[25:55] in the left hand
[25:56] it's in the right hand
[25:58] of the one sitting on the throne
[26:01] now
[26:06] the background for the opening of The
[26:09] Seven Seals
[26:11] is for you and me
[26:20] that are the chosen of God
[26:24] to see
[26:27] that we
[26:29] must prepare ourselves
[26:33] for the opening
[26:35] and I said it this morning and I'll say
[26:37] it again then what do you mean the
[26:40] shield broken prophet
[26:43] he said it's gone from you
[26:46] and you don't know it
[26:51] just because that
[26:53] Greta Branham was here
[26:55] and that God came to brother Brown and I
[26:57] agree with that I believed it yeah
[27:01] but does that make God coming to me and
[27:03] you
[27:05] God came in 63 brother Dale I'll have
[27:08] you to understand who too
[27:11] where was you at in 63
[27:14] where was I at in 63 had an organized
[27:17] religion
[27:20] yes but the Lord came he did he came to
[27:22] the prophet
[27:27] it don't make it automatically come into
[27:29] us because it had come to him that's
[27:33] right
[27:34] has the Lord come to you
[27:38] wrote a randomly let's see I'll make the
[27:40] statement it's Embassy book he said has
[27:42] he through the old opening of this
[27:44] these seals revealed itself to you
[27:53] yeah but you said well brother you sound
[27:55] like you're trying to get your seals
[27:56] open again
[27:57] oh I'm glad you thought of that I'm
[28:01] trying to get them to open to you
[28:03] and me
[28:08] that's who I wanted to reveal to is me
[28:10] and you that's right
[28:11] all right man I want it open to me and
[28:13] you
[28:15] I want to see it for myself
[28:18] right
[28:19] I just bleed the prophet well amen
[28:25] wonderful now what about you
[28:29] I told you this morning that you you
[28:32] wouldn't die so you wouldn't know it a
[28:33] good Baptist Doctrine
[28:35] if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:37] I got it I said come on to that
[28:39] Pentecost
[28:42] really did go find you one and ask him
[28:43] exactly the way he believes him
[28:46] how do you believe about getting a new
[28:48] birth
[28:49] I believe I got it come on death
[28:51] Pentecost
[28:53] well now that's 2 000 years between the
[28:56] event
[28:57] right
[28:59] and you talking about it
[29:01] all right where were we at in 63.
[29:09] that's what 50
[29:12] my mind slipped on that no matter how do
[29:14] you counted let me hear that be not 50
[29:17] something 49 or whatever
[29:19] say 50 years ago
[29:24] it came to brother Brown
[29:29] but there's a lot of distance in between
[29:30] there
[29:33] a lot of you wasn't even born
[29:36] huh
[29:40] you see what I'm talking about you said
[29:42] well that that happened because
[29:44] and that's the way people think
[29:46] you said no brother now you don't
[29:48] understand
[29:49] I'm sorry that's what hurts my heart I
[29:52] do understand
[29:54] I understand the hindrance that you and
[29:56] I
[29:57] to understand God's word
[30:00] that's right yes
[30:06] these of course a lot of people then
[30:08] believes that but around this come to
[30:10] make a way for them you know I need to
[30:12] introduce them
[30:14] not me in broad form one form you know
[30:18] to take over
[30:20] you've heard of those you've been around
[30:22] them
[30:23] you know
[30:24] that they claim to be the one brother
[30:26] random come to introduce
[30:28] well I don't I believe you come to
[30:30] introduce the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:33] and then tell us where that's at right
[30:36] because that's in you and I
[30:38] all right now you might find out then
[30:42] eventually
[30:45] that
[30:46] we're talking about you and I
[30:55] were talking about the bride all the way
[30:57] through
[31:00] there was never to be a group of people
[31:01] to understand
[31:03] this book
[31:05] we'll get to it in a minute
[31:09] would you believe if I could read to
[31:10] your word even in Jeremiah where it was
[31:12] sealed up in an Earthly vessel
[31:16] and that Earthly vest will become flesh
[31:20] lived upon this Earth
[31:24] we're still sealed up about him until
[31:26] the end time
[31:29] in this message
[31:31] that is brought to you and I
[31:33] what are we doing here
[31:35] 40 50 years after the prophet passing on
[31:41] me
[31:45] you know right around done a lot of
[31:47] typing and things and
[31:49] you remember the little white woman
[31:50] darling
[31:52] her son
[31:54] and said her husband had died
[31:57] during the drought
[32:02] and heard her little boy left alone you
[32:04] remember the two sticks and the gonna
[32:06] make the bread and eat you know and die
[32:09] he said her husband
[32:11] her denomination
[32:16] you remember a few weeks ago when I was
[32:18] trying to ask that question is our whole
[32:20] husband dead
[32:24] our old husband is our carnal thinking
[32:26] about
[32:29] the Bible
[32:31] that's our denominational husband is
[32:34] what we have figured out
[32:36] for ourselves
[32:39] well you don't believe in nothing but
[32:41] run around my eyes I'm glad you thought
[32:43] of that too
[32:44] because I believe in that's what it's
[32:46] bringing he brought us the message but
[32:48] now it's an individual Affair this is
[32:51] not a corporate thing you know where
[32:53] would you call it a group therapy this
[32:56] is an individual Affair yes right
[32:59] that's why one person sit right beside
[33:01] the other person and go in the Rapture
[33:03] and the other person totally missed it
[33:06] is not a group therapy it's not a
[33:10] husband and wife of Fire
[33:12] if your children are old enough for the
[33:15] age of accountability they must have the
[33:16] baptism in the Holy Ghost right or they
[33:19] don't go with you
[33:20] I've preached that those under the age
[33:22] of accountability will be under their
[33:24] mothers and fathers yes
[33:26] if they are born again Christians you
[33:28] know
[33:30] true bride
[33:31] but once you reach the age of
[33:33] accountability children
[33:35] teenagers whatever you are responsible
[33:39] you're not going because an automatic
[33:42] process that Mom and Dad is going that's
[33:44] right you're gonna have to have your own
[33:45] Holy Ghost
[33:47] that's right
[33:49] you know watch that as we get through
[33:51] because
[33:53] the background as I said
[33:56] the preparation for you and I to be able
[33:59] to understand the seals
[34:02] is to realize that he has chosen you and
[34:06] I yeah for a purpose
[34:11] and we must prepare ourselves for that
[34:15] purpose now what is our purpose
[34:19] the purpose of this end time right I
[34:21] thought according to the Bible a day
[34:23] without us cannot be made perfect
[34:26] I thought everything is waiting on
[34:28] somebody
[34:30] to reach a position
[34:39] I won't ask for a raise of hands
[34:42] but I hope I get back to the message at
[34:44] the end of it
[34:45] I want to just ask you a simple question
[34:51] do you believe Redemption is over
[35:01] do you believe Redemption is over
[35:10] what about
[35:15] you know the redemption's over
[35:21] the lamb had left The Mercy Seat
[35:30] you agree
[35:33] but you know if it's not over
[35:37] he hasn't left emergency
[35:41] now what are you going to do with all of
[35:43] your great ideas about the seals
[35:47] and the thing
[35:50] when the seals can't be revealed until
[35:52] the lamb leaves a mercy seat
[35:57] oh
[36:04] strange talking brother
[36:11] see what you're saying if you're saying
[36:14] that God come in 63 and the lamb left
[36:16] the mercy Seaton 63. then Redemption was
[36:20] over in 63.
[36:24] knocks out 98 of what's here doesn't it
[36:31] come on
[36:33] sure
[36:37] but if you believe that
[36:40] brother Branham saw this by revelation
[36:45] that it was not an actual happening
[36:51] it was revelation
[36:53] of what was to take place
[36:57] then you can believe Redemption is still
[36:59] here
[37:03] do I need to rethink that again how many
[37:06] of you believe redemption's over
[37:11] well you'd say no I don't believe it's
[37:12] over well then the lamb ain't left The
[37:14] Mercy Seat
[37:22] now if the lamb that left a mercy seat
[37:29] how did the seals get broke
[37:37] you see one of these days what I drove
[37:39] at for 40 something years
[37:43] profit can see things
[37:45] highest present and future
[37:49] before it ever takes place
[37:54] Pride
[37:58] can see ice present and future
[38:04] by way of the prophet's message
[38:07] and it ain't come to pass yet
[38:09] you need a quote run around and says the
[38:12] seals reveal what has been what is and
[38:14] what will be
[38:19] and write that down
[38:23] I put it in my memory bank to think
[38:25] about it
[38:29] brother
[38:33] see did the lamb leave the mercy see
[38:42] if it is the biggest portion of you sit
[38:44] down to earn me too because my salvation
[38:46] come later now I was a good Baptist
[38:49] under salvation in 63. but my salvation
[38:53] really born again experience was 69 so
[38:55] you know that just take all of us out
[38:57] just about it
[39:01] and you'd be lost
[39:04] so what do you believe
[39:09] so if you can't put that together and I
[39:11] think what you need to do is just to say
[39:13] let me just listen a little bit maybe
[39:15] this man knows what he's talking about
[39:20] as I said this morning when brother monk
[39:23] said that about going God to me I had no
[39:26] way to argue with him
[39:28] I knew that
[39:30] so it was time to shut up and listen
[39:38] maybe that's time
[39:42] are you trying to build yourself up good
[39:43] for you thinking that away
[39:47] because there's never been but one it
[39:49] just means they were exalted and that's
[39:51] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[39:55] but I know where it all comes from what
[39:57] I did and what it does and all I care so
[39:59] I don't worry about it
[40:02] but it just asked you a simple question
[40:08] gender strife
[40:11] the prophet said questions make some
[40:13] strong church now what are you going to
[40:15] do two quotes fighting each other
[40:19] what is your settlement in your mind
[40:23] sound left for you to be able to just
[40:25] sit down and talk about your own
[40:27] experience
[40:29] I love to hear people's experiences
[40:34] of how the Lord LED you
[40:38] and how you received him as your
[40:40] personal savior
[40:49] maybe you might find out and I'll get
[40:51] off of that then
[40:53] that I'm not talking about a future
[40:56] event
[40:58] I'm trying to speak something that is
[41:00] here
[41:01] amen a reality
[41:05] if not when will it be here
[41:12] right
[41:14] now then let me make a life statement we
[41:16] move on you know that the children of
[41:18] Israel could not leave Egypt
[41:26] Moses tried to free him the truth
[41:30] killed a dead Egyptian that's right
[41:34] you know he had to go even though he was
[41:38] God's prophet
[41:39] ordained a prophet
[41:41] even though he met the burning bush at
[41:43] the in the mountain and all of those
[41:46] things and saw God personal
[41:49] he set out there for 40 years
[41:54] you know what he's waiting on
[42:00] the prophet said he's waiting on the
[42:01] Readiness of the people
[42:05] he said the right Pharaoh had to be on
[42:07] the throne what would have happened if
[42:09] Moses had walked back down there with
[42:12] bro you know that was on the throne when
[42:14] you remember the story that thought he
[42:17] was one of them and raised him and
[42:19] honored him was going to make him the
[42:21] next ruler of Egypt
[42:24] no boy had to be dead
[42:26] new favorite had to come up
[42:29] he's like it was with Joseph they had to
[42:31] be wanted
[42:33] didn't know Joseph
[42:38] just talking
[42:41] what are we looking for
[42:44] and when are we going to start believing
[42:46] what is taking place
[42:54] now with all this in mind
[42:57] what does it say in Revelations 5.
[43:02] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[43:04] said on the throne
[43:06] a book
[43:09] written Within
[43:11] on the backside
[43:14] sealed
[43:16] was selling seals
[43:19] all right let's talk about that book
[43:23] what kind of a book is it
[43:27] what kind of a book is back there
[43:35] I've heard people say
[43:38] I'm not joking you've heard it too
[43:40] probably
[43:41] I've heard people say that King James
[43:44] version of the good enough for Peter and
[43:46] Paul
[43:47] is good enough for me you ever heard
[43:49] that
[43:54] now that's a good saying
[43:57] I really show spirituality
[44:02] when in the days of Peter and Paul and
[44:04] them there wasn't no King James version
[44:06] that's right the King James version the
[44:09] 1611 is the original King James version
[44:12] and you can argue with me all you want
[44:15] to and say that Bible on the front of it
[44:17] is King James Version
[44:19] but you better look in the front
[44:22] either say a revised 19 and 11 or 19 and
[44:26] 9 1911 1917 and this is revised and
[44:30] revised and revised and you know
[44:33] I got one called it says right down here
[44:36] King James Version
[44:39] you ever seen the King James version 16
[44:41] 11.
[44:46] world and them used to have them but
[44:49] how much do they have so the church one
[44:51] time after I kept talking about the 1611
[44:54] you know somebody I don't know who it
[44:56] was one on the internet and they found a
[44:57] 16-11 Edition
[44:59] they bought me one
[45:03] it's about that thick
[45:09] the original
[45:11] King James Version
[45:13] in 1611 it's about that thick
[45:20] surprising to me how big it was
[45:24] all right
[45:25] but you get what I'm talking about yeah
[45:28] yeah you see how spiritual we are
[45:32] if the King James version good enough
[45:34] for Peter and Paul it's good enough for
[45:36] me
[45:37] and I'll take that red letter Edition
[45:42] that's why no you run into these I'm
[45:45] sure that's why we baptized Fox I know
[45:47] he knows because Jesus said in Riddler
[45:51] he said well what about Peter I'll take
[45:53] what Jesus said over what Peter said
[45:57] you've heard that one
[46:00] see that's our spiritual we are
[46:04] you know what did we believe it so much
[46:06] that the way that we think God's going
[46:07] to change and fit that way of thinking
[46:10] you know what
[46:13] I don't think it will I'm just honest
[46:17] trying to be just as straight lying to
[46:20] you and me
[46:23] because you see when John wrote this
[46:25] with 1895-96 somewhere right in there
[46:29] at that time you didn't have what you
[46:31] call the book
[46:35] the original translation doesn't say
[46:37] book
[46:39] it says scroll
[46:42] this didn't come into existence until of
[46:45] a book form
[46:46] until just a few hundred years ago
[46:50] you know the printing press and the
[46:52] things we put out and they find it they
[46:53] made what we call the book form all
[46:55] right
[46:56] now
[46:58] so the original book in the hand of the
[47:01] one sitting on the throne
[47:05] without spending a lot of time to
[47:08] emphasize a lot on it
[47:10] it would not be uh
[47:12] Thompson Chain or
[47:15] Scofield Edition you know
[47:20] it'd be a scroll
[47:24] all right
[47:29] the word book
[47:33] would come into being later
[47:35] so when they translated it into the King
[47:37] James version
[47:39] then is when you pick it up where it
[47:41] come up with the word book
[47:44] because it had become into that form of
[47:47] understanding
[47:51] so it was a scroll
[47:53] we're familiar with those words and we
[47:55] talk about the Dead Sea Scrolls the
[47:57] things and when we were in Israel were
[47:59] wonderful to be able to go there and and
[48:01] view the places where that they the
[48:04] monastery type of thing that they had
[48:06] where they were there and they're doing
[48:08] the writings of those things and started
[48:10] you know stored up those Scrolls into
[48:12] the caves and the pain
[48:14] and you know that Israel not thinking
[48:17] anything about the New Testament because
[48:19] a lot of people when you say Dead Sea
[48:21] scroll they think in the Old Testament
[48:22] struggles there was only partial Old
[48:26] Testament Scrolls in the Dead Sea
[48:28] Scrolls
[48:29] go look it up those were the Scrolls or
[48:32] the writings of the basic what we call
[48:35] the New Testament
[48:37] it wasn't all together the Old Testament
[48:40] it went all together to do that some of
[48:42] the full body full books like Isaiah I
[48:44] think is one for certain that was in
[48:46] those what they call the Dead Sea scroll
[48:48] you know that Israel thinks so much of
[48:50] those things until they have this in
[48:53] this great big building and they have it
[48:55] and they have it kind of round where you
[48:56] can walk around and you know you can see
[48:58] the books and the things that was made
[49:00] and that was amazing to me
[49:03] but you know they thank so much until
[49:05] they just didn't put the Old Testament
[49:07] Scrolls in there
[49:09] they put all those Scrolls that they
[49:11] found
[49:12] and they have it almost bomb proof
[49:15] they said that any warning came
[49:17] whatsoever on attack
[49:22] that whole thing collapses Inward and
[49:28] to make it as bomb proof as possible
[49:31] they think that much of your new
[49:34] testament Scrolls
[49:38] all right now you know the Scrolls what
[49:41] they've done that the only way you gotta
[49:43] scroll if you're going to have a new
[49:44] church is you had somebody to write it
[49:48] and they say that that's actually what
[49:50] that
[49:51] um Lazarus was doing
[49:53] and and every time in the Bible that
[49:55] they come to that g Dash
[49:58] d
[50:00] they would get up and go take a bath
[50:04] before they would write that word
[50:06] because it was so
[50:07] honorable that's the story behind
[50:10] Lazarus that he died from taking too
[50:11] many baths
[50:13] because that's what he was doing
[50:15] he was writing those Scrolls or copying
[50:17] them
[50:18] I had to have everything just perfect
[50:20] because one little move would entirely
[50:23] change the meaning in the writings
[50:27] it was the Scrolls
[50:31] you've heard the story of how brother
[50:32] Brown was talking about the the mark you
[50:35] know was part of the torn off
[50:37] that's because those Scrolls had
[50:39] deteriorated around the end
[50:41] and you know
[50:43] because of the weather conditions
[50:44] because they were just stored up in a
[50:46] cave
[50:48] they were not in a vault or in this it
[50:50] was in caves
[50:52] amazing situation for God to be able to
[50:55] preserve those things you know to be
[50:57] able to keep them but it's a scroll
[51:01] all right
[51:03] now we'll read this in a minute from
[51:05] Brother random so yes you'll know it's
[51:07] not my idea
[51:08] so those Scrolls would be rolled up
[51:13] you know they're parchment or what you
[51:16] call animal skins
[51:18] you know
[51:20] and then they were rolled up
[51:24] all right then when it was rolled up see
[51:27] then you would tie it
[51:29] and you'd put a tag on there or what
[51:31] that was
[51:32] you can argue whether this roll is the
[51:35] tag or the tag on top of a roll that's
[51:38] and what you want to do ain't gonna
[51:40] argue with you about it I'm just trying
[51:41] to make us an illustration
[51:45] so each one of those Scrolls would be
[51:47] there and you just have a tag sticking
[51:48] out
[51:50] and it would say Isaiah
[51:53] no
[51:54] you wouldn't be going through having to
[51:56] unroll ever scroll to try to find out
[51:58] what the books were
[52:01] a lot of them show it rolling inward
[52:03] this way
[52:05] no
[52:07] a lot on show one roll
[52:10] I don't know but and a lot of us rolled
[52:13] out that way and it went
[52:17] I ain't concerned about that my point is
[52:19] to just illustrate something
[52:22] if you took this kind of a book
[52:28] and you put seven straps on it you put
[52:30] something outside the book
[52:36] and that's what people think that the
[52:37] great mystery of the settlement seal is
[52:39] something outside the book
[52:43] so they make it anything they want it to
[52:44] be
[52:46] huh
[52:48] I've Illustrated it by telling you what
[52:50] Margaret brother Gary's first wife you
[52:53] know was
[52:54] we were eating and we were talking about
[52:57] this situation and I said you know
[52:58] people believe that the great mystery
[53:00] that seal is that you know you can have
[53:02] all the wives you want
[53:05] and you know I said but now you can get
[53:08] you know your own Revelation is what
[53:09] they think you know and to Margaret she
[53:12] was very quiet didn't speak a whole lot
[53:15] but she simply looked over to me and she
[53:17] said if that be right brother Dale then
[53:19] I'll get to Revelation I take my 357 and
[53:22] blow Gary's head off
[53:25] I said sister I agree with you but if
[53:28] you could make it one thing you can make
[53:30] it enough
[53:31] right
[53:34] but see why would it be written I'm just
[53:36] saying this part about it but I'm not
[53:38] trying to argue with anybody about the
[53:40] written within on the back side or
[53:42] whatever
[53:43] I'm just saying and I'll read you a
[53:45] little bit if it was this kind of book
[53:46] you'd have seven straps added to it
[53:51] that's what he said
[53:54] no selling straps would be outside the
[53:55] book
[53:57] but if it's a scroll
[54:00] and simply rolled up
[54:07] you can tie it with a string
[54:11] like I said you wouldn't want to open
[54:13] every one of them and try to find out
[54:14] what it is
[54:17] so you would just put a little
[54:20] tag some way attached
[54:25] that would say Isaiah
[54:29] Jeremiah see
[54:31] then you could reach down and get the
[54:33] book
[54:35] that
[54:37] is the only way to understand
[54:40] what Revelations 5 says
[54:44] you notice I said the only way
[54:48] to understand what Revelation 5 says
[54:50] there's a book written Within
[54:53] and on the backside
[54:57] sealed
[54:59] was selling seals
[55:03] then when you come to the seals what is
[55:05] it
[55:06] unrolled it
[55:09] my horse rider
[55:16] do you make it a book and what have you
[55:18] got we'll read that in just a minute
[55:19] sometimes just get the point in your
[55:21] mind if you think about
[55:24] so it couldn't be an ordinary book
[55:26] you would be adding two
[55:30] and if you had something on the outside
[55:32] of the book
[55:33] then you would be contrary to what the
[55:35] book itself says
[55:39] the book itself according to the Bible
[55:41] and according to the prophet said it was
[55:44] in the beginning a sin caused a problem
[55:49] an adding to
[55:51] he said in the middle of the book
[55:53] they're trying to add two he said in the
[55:55] end of the book it says if you had to
[55:58] he'll add the plagues that are written
[56:01] in the book
[56:02] but if you take away you'll take away
[56:04] your name out of the book
[56:08] but just let it be a scroll
[56:11] let it be a scroll and just roll it up
[56:14] because every what you want to think
[56:16] that's what it was
[56:19] you see a tab to tell you what that is
[56:22] and now you haven't added to the book
[56:26] the tab is only telling you what's there
[56:33] you see we don't realize we're trying to
[56:34] add Cobble
[56:37] if it is something like this book and
[56:39] it's outside
[56:41] what are you gonna do
[56:50] you would add too so that then whatever
[56:52] your idea is of what's added to would be
[56:55] just as good as anybody else's idea
[57:00] the seals was written in the book
[57:05] you say only six of them I beg your
[57:08] pardon Revelation 8 1.
[57:10] said when the seventh seal was opened
[57:13] there was silence in heaven
[57:16] brother Ryan said see the Irish open
[57:19] of course you got a lot of doctrines in
[57:21] the message now that some say it's not
[57:22] open and some say it is open
[57:25] the bible plan he says it's open
[57:28] it was in the book
[57:30] but there was no writing
[57:32] was just silence
[57:36] in heaven all right
[57:38] but think about that now as we go along
[57:41] now
[57:44] we don't want to add to the book
[57:47] no we don't want to take away from the
[57:48] book
[57:51] now
[57:53] so look what your profit go ahead and
[57:55] pull up number one brother
[57:58] Bob I guess it's back there
[58:02] now let's read what your Prophet has to
[58:04] say
[58:06] paragraph 43-45 of the first seal
[58:10] 63 318
[58:15] now the seventh seal
[58:18] roll book
[58:20] is now being released by the land
[58:23] we approach that place tonight
[58:27] God helpless
[58:28] as the seals are broken and released
[58:32] the mysteries of the book are revealed
[58:35] now you see this is a sealed book
[58:38] now we believe that do we not
[58:42] we believe that it is a seal book
[58:45] now we never known this before
[58:49] okay
[58:52] but it is it's sealed with Seven Seals
[58:56] that he is on the back of the book
[59:00] the book is sealed with Seven Seals
[59:05] now that's exactly like he said in this
[59:07] seven seal roll in the back right
[59:12] if we was talking about
[59:16] it it would be like putting a strap
[59:18] across it
[59:20] selling straps
[59:22] but it isn't this kind of a book it's a
[59:24] scroll
[59:26] and then when the scroll is Unwound
[59:28] that's one then laying right in the
[59:31] scroll is number two and right here it
[59:33] says what it is but it's a mystery
[59:37] but yet we have probe in it
[59:41] but remember the book is sealed
[59:43] and the book is a book of mystery of of
[59:46] redemption
[59:47] I'm Excuse me Revelation
[59:49] it is a revelation of Jesus Christ see a
[59:53] book of Revelation now you know down
[59:56] Through the Ages man has probed and
[59:58] tried to get into that
[1:00:00] we all have
[1:00:05] what is it
[1:00:08] look the next one
[1:00:11] breach
[1:00:14] 63 317. see a seal in the whole Bible
[1:00:18] was like a roll like this and here was
[1:00:20] here was a mystery and this mystery was
[1:00:23] hidden alrighty was sealed around and
[1:00:25] put here the claim to so and so
[1:00:28] then the next mystery was wrapped around
[1:00:30] of what this inheritance was and stuck
[1:00:32] out here on this side
[1:00:34] the claim to so-and-so and went on down
[1:00:36] until it made a scroll because people
[1:00:39] didn't have books like this then it was
[1:00:42] in a row how many knows that call it a
[1:00:45] scroll well I see a scroll you could
[1:00:48] break loose one year what the mystery of
[1:00:51] this was and turn it loose and you could
[1:00:53] see what the claim was and then break
[1:00:56] the other one loose and see what that
[1:00:59] claim was Twister scroll
[1:01:03] all right
[1:01:05] number three
[1:01:10] taken from the first cl318 paragraph six
[1:01:12] for instance if I had something here I'd
[1:01:15] show you what I mean
[1:01:17] here's one seal that's one and you roll
[1:01:19] it up like this the way it was rolled
[1:01:21] and you roll it up in this manner and at
[1:01:24] the end there's a little piece sticking
[1:01:26] out like that
[1:01:27] remember rolling a little time a little
[1:01:30] piece sticking out
[1:01:31] that's the first seal all right and
[1:01:35] that's the first part of the book then
[1:01:37] the next seal is rolled in this manner
[1:01:39] right by the side of it and it's rolled
[1:01:41] up in this manner like here and then at
[1:01:43] the end right here there's another
[1:01:45] sticking out means two seals and that's
[1:01:48] the way the whole Bible was wrote in
[1:01:50] scroll and so to break these seals it
[1:01:52] opens the Mysteries
[1:01:54] of the book
[1:02:02] look at the next one
[1:02:06] the breach 63 317 eating service
[1:02:10] but in the last age
[1:02:13] all these Mysteries are to be solved and
[1:02:15] handed out
[1:02:16] and the seals are to be opened by the
[1:02:18] lamb and revealed to the church
[1:02:23] and then time is no more
[1:02:25] still wonderful
[1:02:27] then the book then
[1:02:29] is the book of redemption
[1:02:32] where it goes ahead brings in later on
[1:02:34] 144 000 brought in so far
[1:02:37] now
[1:02:40] it's the book of redemption
[1:02:43] right
[1:02:45] and it's sealed
[1:02:48] with Seven Seals
[1:02:51] so when I ask you the question again
[1:02:55] is redemption owner
[1:03:00] and people are arguing right now
[1:03:02] probably
[1:03:04] but was it over in 63
[1:03:06] when the seals broke to the prophet
[1:03:13] where would you be
[1:03:21] but see for it to be revealed to the
[1:03:23] prophet
[1:03:25] didn't mean the lamb had left The Mercy
[1:03:27] Seat
[1:03:31] because if you read the bridge you'll
[1:03:33] find these statements when he leaves The
[1:03:35] Mercy Seat
[1:03:37] he becomes down here
[1:03:42] right we'll get to it in the next
[1:03:45] service or so
[1:03:47] that the lamb is the one that breaks the
[1:03:49] seals right amen but John was told the
[1:03:53] line of the tribe of Judah
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:58] when redemption's over he becomes a lion
[1:04:01] and two redemption's overheating lamb
[1:04:06] what about it
[1:04:09] or was it what I've always tried to get
[1:04:11] you to see that in 1963
[1:04:13] God revealed to the prophet
[1:04:20] what those seals were
[1:04:25] just like
[1:04:28] in 1958
[1:04:31] he revealed to the prophet
[1:04:35] and he tied it together and preached a
[1:04:37] message called serpent seed
[1:04:42] is that right
[1:04:48] did he come here knowing everything or
[1:04:50] did it open as he went through
[1:04:56] so to save the day brother I want to
[1:04:58] preach on the opening of these seals
[1:05:01] does that mean redemption's over
[1:05:05] or does it mean it's revealed to us what
[1:05:07] is under those seals
[1:05:11] Abraham I cannot hold from you anything
[1:05:20] you know Isaiah wrote an entire Bible
[1:05:23] going down to the tribulation and the
[1:05:25] Millennium and the thing
[1:05:27] was it over because Isaiah wrote it
[1:05:31] and that name started
[1:05:37] just what we think
[1:05:41] that we think we're so smart we think
[1:05:43] we're so revelated
[1:05:49] but if we just get it down to the bases
[1:05:51] of seeing
[1:05:53] that those seals broke to the prophet
[1:05:59] because he was a prophet right
[1:06:01] and then he could tell us what they were
[1:06:05] but as I started off then it's got to be
[1:06:07] revealed to you and I
[1:06:10] amen right
[1:06:13] what kind of a book is it
[1:06:19] all right
[1:06:21] we know for certainly that brother Ryan
[1:06:23] said see there
[1:06:25] there was a book in the hand of the one
[1:06:26] sitting on the Drone and she said this
[1:06:28] lamb come up and took the book out of
[1:06:30] the hand he said now that wasn't no
[1:06:32] animal
[1:06:33] you remember that I gave it to you
[1:06:36] that had to be a man
[1:06:39] because the animal was not qualified
[1:06:42] but
[1:06:43] so that wasn't a lamb that took the book
[1:06:46] out of the hand of the one sitting on
[1:06:47] the Drone
[1:06:55] the lamb couldn't do it
[1:06:57] you couldn't qualify
[1:06:59] it had to be a kinsman redeemer
[1:07:03] right right
[1:07:06] so what are we thinking about
[1:07:15] to the point
[1:07:18] I want to just lay these down a little
[1:07:20] bit so we'll go ahead to number five
[1:07:24] and look what he calls it
[1:07:27] this is the breach
[1:07:28] 63 317 evening
[1:07:32] you talking about this forfeited Tyler
[1:07:34] need is now in the hands of the original
[1:07:37] owner almighty God
[1:07:42] the title did to eat to the Earth and to
[1:07:45] eternal life
[1:07:46] when Adam forfeited it Satan's dirty
[1:07:49] hands could not take it
[1:07:55] so it went back to the original owner of
[1:07:58] God himself
[1:08:01] thank you
[1:08:03] now that's enough right there with that
[1:08:05] one of those sentence is enough to let
[1:08:07] me know that
[1:08:09] we're missing the point of what it is
[1:08:13] if it had been a scroll book that you're
[1:08:16] just talking about those are for
[1:08:18] illustrations
[1:08:22] because if it had been just a scroll
[1:08:24] book Satan could have got his hands on
[1:08:25] it
[1:08:31] they could have marred it right
[1:08:35] so it's not just a book it's not just a
[1:08:38] scroll then
[1:08:43] it's the Plan of Redemption
[1:08:50] because what did he say it was we're
[1:08:52] going to find in just a minute there he
[1:08:53] sits on the throne
[1:08:55] with it in his hand
[1:08:58] the bug
[1:09:00] he's right hand and what does he call it
[1:09:02] the Donald D oh that makes me feel
[1:09:04] religious friends the title need to
[1:09:07] eternal life Abstract title deed to
[1:09:09] eternal life
[1:09:11] when Adam forwarded it for wisdom
[1:09:13] instead of faith it went back to the
[1:09:14] hands of the owner almighty God what a
[1:09:17] great thing
[1:09:18] ain't no networking
[1:09:21] Waiting For redemption's claimed it's
[1:09:24] Redemption but in this book of
[1:09:26] redemption
[1:09:28] this title deed after that title deed
[1:09:30] you say abstract what does an abstract
[1:09:32] mean means it searched all the way back
[1:09:35] to its beginning
[1:09:37] like that little drop
[1:09:39] I'll eat this morning when it struck
[1:09:41] that bleach it went all the way back
[1:09:44] and When sin had been confessed and
[1:09:46] fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:47] only it gives an abstract right straight
[1:09:50] back to the Creator again and you become
[1:09:53] a son of God
[1:09:55] abstract
[1:09:56] child deed is held in the hand of the
[1:09:58] Almighty
[1:10:00] now he calls it an abstract title to eat
[1:10:09] it's a DD eternal life
[1:10:11] yes
[1:10:16] you don't have an abstract for your
[1:10:18] property I'm sorry you can claim your
[1:10:20] own your property I'm sorry you own as
[1:10:22] long as a government
[1:10:23] yes is doing the Indian has abstract
[1:10:27] we don't have an abstract
[1:10:30] if you don't have your home shirts back
[1:10:33] when you buy one be real careful
[1:10:36] they only run a possible 20-year
[1:10:39] connection to your Deeds unless you pay
[1:10:44] an extra amount of money
[1:10:46] you got to pay more money to get a form
[1:10:48] of what is even close to an abstract
[1:10:53] you can think this is crazy but I
[1:10:55] experienced it we got ready to build a
[1:10:57] house we had bought this land for the
[1:10:59] man we paid the man for the land we had
[1:11:03] the deed to the land as a matter of fact
[1:11:04] we paid him monthly payments and he
[1:11:06] wrote a receipt on the deed
[1:11:10] and we had every bit of that but we got
[1:11:12] ready to borrow money on our home 65 the
[1:11:15] early building in Gilson and the bank
[1:11:18] says you don't own it
[1:11:23] is it because somebody's got an older
[1:11:25] deed than you've got
[1:11:27] gonna find out the man that used to own
[1:11:29] the property and put the property up
[1:11:31] against a bill for buying food and and
[1:11:34] supplies for the farm you know and seed
[1:11:36] and stuff
[1:11:38] and the man that
[1:11:40] went to church with us the band that
[1:11:42] would actually he said I remember when a
[1:11:44] man done that but he said we were
[1:11:46] supposed to cancel that out but said we
[1:11:48] didn't do it
[1:11:49] see that man could have took my property
[1:11:56] see you better try to think about
[1:11:57] abstract
[1:11:59] now listen going to church and being
[1:12:01] good
[1:12:04] you get a deed to eternal life when you
[1:12:07] believe
[1:12:09] you notice the way I said it you get a
[1:12:11] deed to eternal life when you believe
[1:12:15] you remember see I preached on this many
[1:12:17] many years ago many times
[1:12:19] when you received the baptism of the
[1:12:21] Holy Ghost you get an abstract time to
[1:12:23] leave
[1:12:25] say you can't take it away right you can
[1:12:29] take it away from it justification and
[1:12:31] sanctification
[1:12:33] because you're just believing unto
[1:12:36] we can't take it away when you're born
[1:12:37] again
[1:12:38] abstract titled Eve
[1:12:41] so he calls this book in the handle the
[1:12:43] one on the throne
[1:12:44] an abstract title deed
[1:12:49] The Plan of Redemption
[1:12:51] all right
[1:12:55] let's see something else he talks about
[1:12:57] rule number six up
[1:13:00] the first C of progress 33.
[1:13:04] you see the book actually was planned
[1:13:06] and they talking about the book in the
[1:13:08] handle going on the throne right
[1:13:09] everybody understand me yes
[1:13:12] see the book
[1:13:14] I actually was planned
[1:13:16] and written before the foundation of the
[1:13:18] world right
[1:13:22] now the book in the handling one on the
[1:13:24] throne
[1:13:25] was planned and written before the
[1:13:27] foundation world
[1:13:28] this book The Bible
[1:13:33] this is good it was really written
[1:13:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:39] but the Bible says lamb slam before the
[1:13:42] foundation where all names were written
[1:13:43] were written for the foundation world
[1:13:45] right it's only a Bible
[1:13:50] was written before the foundation of the
[1:13:51] world
[1:13:54] Christ being the lamb was slain before
[1:13:56] the foundation world and the members of
[1:13:58] his bride their names were put in the
[1:14:00] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:14:02] before the foundation world
[1:14:11] but it's been sealed up
[1:14:19] he's been sealed up about our names
[1:14:20] being written there
[1:14:23] we didn't understand that when we was in
[1:14:26] the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian we
[1:14:28] could read
[1:14:30] of predestination and foreknowledge and
[1:14:32] foundation of the world and allowance
[1:14:34] flame before the foundation world but
[1:14:35] what was our thoughts about that just be
[1:14:37] honest what you said
[1:14:39] what was your thoughts about that then
[1:14:48] the members of the Bride their names
[1:14:49] were put on the last book of life before
[1:14:51] the foundation world but it's been
[1:14:52] sealed up and now if it's being revealed
[1:14:55] whose names were in there
[1:14:58] all about him
[1:15:01] what a great thing oh John when he saw
[1:15:04] it he said everything in heaven
[1:15:06] everything under the Earth everything
[1:15:07] heard him saying amen and blessings and
[1:15:09] honor he just really was having a great
[1:15:12] time
[1:15:13] for the lamb was Worthy
[1:15:16] now
[1:15:19] what kind of a book is it then
[1:15:23] or is it a scroll
[1:15:32] just asking a simple question
[1:15:37] see we wanted to put a defining
[1:15:39] statement upon a book or a scroll or
[1:15:41] something
[1:15:46] but we just read that wrote around and
[1:15:48] said that the forfeited time will be the
[1:15:50] abstract title deed when Adam forfeited
[1:15:53] it it went back to the hand of the
[1:15:56] original owner he said and we see him on
[1:16:01] the throne holding the book now do we
[1:16:03] need to read that again
[1:16:08] abstract time lead
[1:16:13] names
[1:16:15] is all that's in that book
[1:16:21] and it was called the Bible
[1:16:28] the Bible is only names
[1:16:35] if you took the names out of the book
[1:16:37] you got very few pages of writing right
[1:16:39] you know took them out and laid them out
[1:16:40] on them
[1:16:43] so what's doing it
[1:16:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:50] God had a book
[1:16:52] called the lounge Book of Life That's
[1:16:54] not the book of life it was a split
[1:16:57] sections in it to where your names can
[1:16:58] be transferred Etc we're talking about
[1:17:01] the Lamb's Book of Life the eternal life
[1:17:05] all right
[1:17:09] see then when you come forth Lord we
[1:17:11] didn't call today the Bible
[1:17:18] see the Bible would have only been
[1:17:21] Adam Eve
[1:17:23] Abel said
[1:17:28] right
[1:17:30] are you following me I run out of
[1:17:32] fingers and things to be able to
[1:17:33] illustrate Peter James John Paul
[1:17:38] okay
[1:17:43] Richard
[1:17:47] Chris
[1:17:50] Donnie
[1:17:52] Davy
[1:17:58] Julie
[1:18:00] Esther
[1:18:04] you know that's all there is in the
[1:18:05] Bible
[1:18:08] his names
[1:18:11] now
[1:18:13] but you said wait a minute there's a lot
[1:18:14] in there yeah you know what it is that's
[1:18:17] the record of your life
[1:18:21] did I say if you would only have Adam
[1:18:24] Eve Abel saying this for the point you
[1:18:27] know
[1:18:30] met with all the names
[1:18:35] but you see then God didn't leave us
[1:18:37] that way because he knew we'd need those
[1:18:39] need to point so he wrote what happened
[1:18:42] to Adam
[1:18:46] he wrote what happened to Eve
[1:18:50] oh what would they place on Earth
[1:18:53] right wouldn't he write that
[1:18:56] Judy's mind he could put it down before
[1:18:59] the world but why don't you get it this
[1:19:00] way that before the world he put the
[1:19:02] names down all right
[1:19:06] and in his mind he knew
[1:19:09] that Jesus Christ would have to die
[1:19:13] but that was not a physical dying
[1:19:18] and he knew he would write the rest of
[1:19:20] the book
[1:19:26] what church are you listening
[1:19:31] what you're reading is
[1:19:37] or even some had to have their names
[1:19:38] changed
[1:19:42] Saul to Paul
[1:19:45] cephas to Peter
[1:19:52] had to have a name change
[1:19:57] we talk about
[1:19:59] run around them William Mary and Branham
[1:20:05] 777
[1:20:08] right
[1:20:10] do you know that brother Brown's
[1:20:12] original name was not Branham
[1:20:18] it was Braham
[1:20:23] how many of you know that
[1:20:26] his daddy added the m to it making her
[1:20:29] into it every one had to be put in make
[1:20:31] it brown them
[1:20:33] she goes on his daddy could do it he
[1:20:36] could change it himself if he'd have
[1:20:38] changed itself he's been making himself
[1:20:39] something
[1:20:40] but his father changed it I'm glad my
[1:20:44] father changed my name don't you I got a
[1:20:46] pretty good name my name's Samuel I like
[1:20:48] that it's in the Bible even the word
[1:20:51] Dale is in the Bible let's talk about a
[1:20:53] valley and they talk about people
[1:20:54] Kingsdale
[1:20:57] but
[1:21:00] see God has to make everything ready
[1:21:04] see brother random would have been
[1:21:05] William Marion in six letters on the
[1:21:08] inland
[1:21:10] so his daddy had to change his name make
[1:21:13] it Branham
[1:21:15] see this book on Earth then is going to
[1:21:18] match what's in heaven
[1:21:20] right
[1:21:22] are we still on the story of what I've
[1:21:24] been talking about
[1:21:26] looking up there to see what we are
[1:21:28] we're not up there yet you know what you
[1:21:30] know John was the top of the rapture
[1:21:34] but you know what until we go God we're
[1:21:37] not raptured
[1:21:40] that's right I just like saying
[1:21:41] Redemption was number 63.
[1:21:47] bruh
[1:21:50] do you see what I'm getting at
[1:21:53] the book in the head of the one sitting
[1:21:54] on the throne was the book of names
[1:22:00] then when life came down into being
[1:22:04] and God started recording
[1:22:07] and that's where you wind up that
[1:22:09] brought around and says there's two
[1:22:10] books but he said it's not two books he
[1:22:13] said it's only one book
[1:22:15] with two sections
[1:22:19] invisible Union bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] come on to Saxon of the same book you
[1:22:24] got the book of life and Judas had even
[1:22:26] his name written there
[1:22:29] but his name was not written in the last
[1:22:31] book of life section of eternal life
[1:22:38] what you're dealing with
[1:22:40] the writings
[1:22:43] but these are names
[1:22:46] Moses Aaron
[1:22:51] Ezra Nehemiah Jeremiah
[1:22:55] David Solomon
[1:22:59] when they came to Earth and lived their
[1:23:01] lives
[1:23:04] upon Earth
[1:23:07] on Earth did an Earthly record was made
[1:23:11] that we call
[1:23:13] the Bible
[1:23:16] an Earthly record of all of those
[1:23:19] names
[1:23:24] see now you're gonna
[1:23:26] you listen a minute you'll understand
[1:23:28] something a why that we must so
[1:23:31] importantly so important to realize the
[1:23:33] Book of Revelations is talking about us
[1:23:37] because where would you name me
[1:23:43] come on where's your name
[1:23:48] there's no writing Matthew Mark Luke
[1:23:49] John Acts
[1:23:52] relations Philippians collection and I
[1:23:55] can't name them in order
[1:23:57] never have been able to you're a
[1:23:59] preacher you can't do that no I cannot
[1:24:01] do it
[1:24:02] because I've never tried to remember it
[1:24:04] that way
[1:24:05] I try to remember what's in the book
[1:24:07] that's right instead of where it's at
[1:24:09] because I can go and get me a little Tab
[1:24:12] and find out you know it's my Bible got
[1:24:14] a little tabs
[1:24:16] but listen Church
[1:24:20] without the Book of Revelations and the
[1:24:23] understanding that has been brought to
[1:24:25] you and I where would you find your name
[1:24:28] in the book
[1:24:31] oh
[1:24:33] some of you said that's right
[1:24:35] you realized it hey brother Dale has
[1:24:38] been saying something happening
[1:24:43] The Book of Revelations is where my name
[1:24:45] is at
[1:24:46] he said not Arman now fall down Armadale
[1:24:49] was not written in the book
[1:24:51] he said but what is happening at the
[1:24:54] time I'm a Neville is on Earth
[1:24:56] is written in the book
[1:24:59] should we go and then we read
[1:25:01] Revelations 2. and then three
[1:25:05] and we find a seventh Church age
[1:25:08] and we find where we're at
[1:25:11] and we're beginning to find her name in
[1:25:13] the book right
[1:25:15] now we went over in chapter four did you
[1:25:18] lose all the names and only had to
[1:25:23] named it was in the book no
[1:25:25] my name's in the book
[1:25:31] my because I'm beginning to see what's
[1:25:33] taking place
[1:25:36] so that book in the hand of the one
[1:25:43] does it have to have all the records of
[1:25:46] your life
[1:25:51] I hope not
[1:25:56] right
[1:25:58] it'll be hard to turn these Pages out
[1:26:02] are you listening yes
[1:26:04] and according to this book that's wrote
[1:26:07] about it
[1:26:08] it says my name
[1:26:11] was erased
[1:26:15] and my sins is put in the Seal of his
[1:26:18] forgiveness
[1:26:21] and according to a message called
[1:26:23] invisible Union the prophet says your
[1:26:27] whole name and your old record
[1:26:32] is gone
[1:26:39] so then it's not Richard Anderson is it
[1:26:48] it's not Samuel Dale
[1:26:51] but around and say it's the name
[1:26:54] that was written before the world
[1:27:04] amen what was your name that's what's
[1:27:07] going to be something that may be
[1:27:08] interested some of you coming to the
[1:27:09] next Bible said you know what the next
[1:27:11] one's going to be for next month
[1:27:14] what if your name mean
[1:27:17] the meaning of your name
[1:27:26] I know if one ain't here that had their
[1:27:28] name changed because was it another one
[1:27:30] don't go by the name one of them had it
[1:27:32] officially changed
[1:27:35] on record
[1:27:37] because she didn't like her name
[1:27:41] another one doesn't go by her
[1:27:43] birth certificate record
[1:27:47] s you don't like it
[1:27:51] what does your name mean
[1:27:54] not be interested to see what all of our
[1:27:56] names turn out to mean
[1:27:58] Samuel ask of God
[1:28:02] wait means Wanderer
[1:28:06] Dale means a Pleasant Valley
[1:28:09] ask your God while you're wandering to a
[1:28:11] Pleasant Valley
[1:28:14] but you know that's not my real name
[1:28:22] that's not my real name
[1:28:23] that's my Earthly name for Mom and Daddy
[1:28:26] my daddy was named Sam and everybody
[1:28:28] said well your name is saying well
[1:28:30] there's no way of proving no records
[1:28:32] because nobody don't know we just know
[1:28:34] whatever
[1:28:35] that's why I don't worry about it I
[1:28:37] don't mind you calling me Sam
[1:28:39] I love it or just my daddy in reflection
[1:28:41] but please don't call me Sandy
[1:28:44] I'm sorry
[1:28:47] now if I'd have been raised would some
[1:28:49] of you at the ages you're in I might not
[1:28:51] have done it but I'll bet you the people
[1:28:53] that are my age knows exactly what I'm
[1:28:55] talking about
[1:28:57] because there was a seller back in that
[1:28:59] age that you know I don't like him and
[1:29:02] his name was Sammy
[1:29:04] so don't call me Sammy if there's a lady
[1:29:07] on the horse she's still living or not
[1:29:08] in the Baptist Church if I seen her
[1:29:10] right now she'd say hey Sammy how you
[1:29:12] doing
[1:29:13] well you walk down the girls with women
[1:29:15] one day and you know what they'll say
[1:29:16] there's two or three of them there you
[1:29:18] know what they'll say hey
[1:29:23] what'd you say I said make sure that's
[1:29:25] little brown not little black
[1:29:30] but listen Church
[1:29:35] our lives are written and put in the
[1:29:38] Book of Life
[1:29:41] that makes up the Bible section of Our
[1:29:45] Lives
[1:29:46] but an allowance book of life there's
[1:29:49] nothing but names
[1:29:51] because there's nothing against anybody
[1:29:54] it's not
[1:29:57] it's only God's children
[1:30:01] you know
[1:30:02] so if it was the book of redemption
[1:30:05] so that's one of your foolish virgins
[1:30:08] and things is in the book of and called
[1:30:09] the book of life section
[1:30:14] they're not in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:30:16] of Eternal section
[1:30:18] I see Eternal and Define it
[1:30:22] it's only a book
[1:30:24] so this Bible has a record of my life
[1:30:28] in the Asian time I live upon this Earth
[1:30:34] but there is a book
[1:30:37] there's only contained names
[1:30:41] and no book can fit what that is
[1:30:44] you can't be a scroll you can't be a
[1:30:47] Thompson Chain or a book that we call it
[1:30:53] you know that we used to have in our
[1:30:55] home and we still have the pictures
[1:30:57] we used to have in our home and
[1:30:59] everybody would really like it would
[1:31:00] have been at my home on the wall going
[1:31:02] down through the hallway
[1:31:04] and we had the children from the time
[1:31:06] they were born here was like Wade who
[1:31:10] was on top Wade and Terence and Anna all
[1:31:13] right and up there would be weighed when
[1:31:15] he was born
[1:31:17] and then in his little clothes coming
[1:31:20] along later changing being the four
[1:31:22] years old three years you know it went
[1:31:24] down his life like that
[1:31:26] what year was Terrance when he was born
[1:31:28] and went down his life and Anna when she
[1:31:30] was born
[1:31:32] and went down through there you want to
[1:31:34] go get Anna somewhere if she was born
[1:31:35] and look at Piggies when she was born
[1:31:37] and look at little Abby Grace when she
[1:31:39] was born and you'll see a lot of
[1:31:40] resemblance
[1:31:42] you know but my point is that we were
[1:31:44] trying to keep up with those things and
[1:31:47] you know one day I walked in there and I
[1:31:49] said Lord
[1:31:50] and just point it
[1:31:53] large Wade
[1:31:55] I wish he could have stayed right there
[1:31:59] I looked down and I saw Terrence and I
[1:32:01] said
[1:32:02] I wanted that place on there and I said
[1:32:04] wish he could have stayed right there
[1:32:07] now looked at Anna and I said I wish
[1:32:09] you'd stayed right there
[1:32:11] well you know that was a good daddy a
[1:32:13] good talk
[1:32:19] but
[1:32:20] they wouldn't made for that
[1:32:24] it was not made for that
[1:32:27] it was not made to stop
[1:32:30] you would be taking away their life
[1:32:33] they were made to live their lives out
[1:32:34] and write a book about them
[1:32:43] made to come to their own salvation
[1:32:47] listen just try to get it short in a
[1:32:49] hurry
[1:32:51] so then
[1:32:53] when we're looking at it it's the book
[1:32:55] of redemption
[1:32:56] and only names is in the hand of the one
[1:32:58] sitting on the throne
[1:33:08] now would you please then if there's
[1:33:09] only names written in the book of the
[1:33:11] hand one the one sitting on the throne
[1:33:14] would you please explain to me
[1:33:17] why so much emphasis is placed upon them
[1:33:21] one horse rider being the first seal
[1:33:28] my words right it's not the first see
[1:33:30] him the seals is a revelation of Jesus
[1:33:33] Christ we've done read that today did
[1:33:35] you remember
[1:33:36] the seals is a revelation of Jesus
[1:33:38] Christ it's not the revelation of the
[1:33:40] Antichrist
[1:33:41] you see Jesus Christ standing in the
[1:33:43] place that's what the fifth chapter is
[1:33:45] doing it's putting Christ in a
[1:33:47] perspective that when that seal does
[1:33:49] break you won't see him over there
[1:33:52] you see him standing here and there goes
[1:33:54] to one horse rocker
[1:33:59] but you see that's why I know I'm not
[1:34:01] understood about some of those things
[1:34:02] that'll make a statement but think about
[1:34:04] it
[1:34:06] the book is in the hand of the one on
[1:34:09] the throne it's just named
[1:34:11] but it's revealing those names
[1:34:17] and we come to Earth and live out our
[1:34:18] Natural Life
[1:34:20] but then we come to Salvation
[1:34:23] would that not be when that name is
[1:34:25] picked up
[1:34:26] and understood
[1:34:29] right
[1:34:32] and you wouldn't even know it you just
[1:34:34] know the call
[1:34:41] I hope you listen
[1:34:45] because you see then
[1:34:47] I would pull up the lines from number
[1:34:49] nine
[1:34:51] gotta get on Coppertone running late
[1:34:54] look number nine
[1:34:58] the breach
[1:35:00] paragraph 146 63 317e
[1:35:04] Jeremiah said this scroll must be kept
[1:35:08] yeah I don't have time to get into
[1:35:10] Jeremiah I've got it the thing that was
[1:35:12] what I was using for the
[1:35:14] thing you read your and I'll read
[1:35:16] Ezekiel when you get it better read it
[1:35:18] in Jeremiah but you get it in Ezekiel
[1:35:20] that even in Ezekiel
[1:35:22] um 2 and 10
[1:35:25] and he said he spread it before me and
[1:35:27] it was written within and without
[1:35:31] and there was writing their end
[1:35:33] limitations and mornings and woe you go
[1:35:35] to Jeremiah and you'll see what Jeremiah
[1:35:37] was doing when they went into captivity
[1:35:41] they took the records of who owned the
[1:35:44] land
[1:35:45] they brought them together
[1:35:48] and they buried him
[1:35:50] and put them in Earthly vessels and
[1:35:53] buried them
[1:35:54] the the tie the deed who owns this who
[1:35:57] want that what just your property in
[1:35:59] this belong to who they burying them
[1:36:01] honor and when they came back they went
[1:36:04] and Unearthed that and they began to get
[1:36:07] those Scrolls out and say here it is now
[1:36:10] James calling you on this
[1:36:12] here it is Richard Marlo you on this
[1:36:15] they begin to tell you who was what
[1:36:18] right that was only speaking of this
[1:36:21] right here Jeremiah said this girl must
[1:36:23] be kept as you read it there he'd say he
[1:36:26] must he must be kept in an Earthly
[1:36:28] vessel see oh what a beautiful thing
[1:36:31] that I could talk about a while this
[1:36:34] girl was kept in an Earthly vessel a
[1:36:37] vessel that once became flesh Glory died
[1:36:40] rose again and kept in an Earthly vessel
[1:36:43] until the time of the purchase Oh My
[1:36:46] beautifully all right
[1:36:51] and I keep reading
[1:36:53] now these messages
[1:36:58] he's talking about Jesus Christ right
[1:37:00] you know what Jeremiah's talking about
[1:37:02] that's what the example was back there
[1:37:03] of the earth and vessel that was when it
[1:37:06] was made flesh and dwelled amongst Jesus
[1:37:07] Christ in an Earthly vessel he was all
[1:37:09] the word right
[1:37:11] you know that all those names it was in
[1:37:13] the last book of life was in him when he
[1:37:15] was here I had to do my face a lot of
[1:37:18] foreign
[1:37:24] this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:29] now even after he's made known watch
[1:37:32] all right now these messages are all
[1:37:35] kept up until this Earthly vessel
[1:37:41] until the time of God's appointed time
[1:37:46] at the last messenger
[1:37:49] at the Earth
[1:37:51] and all that these people had judged
[1:37:54] that and said I know it's there I
[1:37:58] believe it's dark it's going to be
[1:38:00] brought forth
[1:38:03] down to these messages he says
[1:38:08] the seals
[1:38:11] are you catching on
[1:38:18] let me read you just a second
[1:38:22] chapter four The Rapture takes place
[1:38:27] chapter five you see the throne
[1:38:30] when sitting on the throne

[1:38:43] that's right amen
[1:38:46] and ours the Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:38:56] and all of us are sitting on it
[1:38:58] that was the
[1:39:01] people of God
[1:39:03] now Through the Ages who would receive
[1:39:05] eternal life that was his children that
[1:39:07] was their names

[1:39:18] and you see the throne in one city on
[1:39:20] the throne as our experiences what's
[1:39:22] taking place now
[1:39:26] and you see the right-handed Powers we
[1:39:29] ended this morning speaking about the
[1:39:31] power of God is now in his bride
[1:39:33] there is no power anywhere else
[1:39:36] amen that's why he said for us to ask
[1:39:40] for us to say
[1:39:42] the power of God has been instilled into
[1:39:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:48] you get anything now you'll get it
[1:39:52] through the bride

[1:40:02] throne

[1:40:14] I hope you're seeing it
[1:40:16] you're not seeing Jesus anywhere there
[1:40:18] by itself
[1:40:21] you're seeing where he's at
[1:40:26] he's in his church

[1:40:34] visible Among Us and raise the Dead
[1:40:38] and we're going to rapture he said your
[1:40:40] Corporal body doesn't come back until
[1:40:42] the Millennium so don't look for that
[1:40:45] look for the visibility of God through
[1:40:47] the revealed word
[1:40:50] and the bride's sitting on the throne
[1:40:58] now remember the next stage of it
[1:41:03] is that there was a lamb came forth
[1:41:10] where does the lamb come from
[1:41:20] see your own Revelation has got to
[1:41:22] produce a lamb for you
[1:41:26] you can't be mine
[1:41:28] that'll be yours
[1:41:33] will your Revelation stand to test
[1:41:40] will it fit the Book of Revelation
[1:41:49] you might begin to find out
[1:41:52] I'll make this statement in the hush
[1:41:56] we are now in the scene
[1:42:02] of the Book of Revelations chapter 5.
[1:42:05] on Earth
[1:42:10] how positive we are in that I don't
[1:42:12] understand I don't know because I ain't
[1:42:14] worried about it
[1:42:17] but the scene is on Earth
[1:42:21] now remember all that we'll get to and
[1:42:23] we'll get into the seals and things but
[1:42:25] just remember one thing
[1:42:30] the seals are Broken Heaven
[1:42:32] handed down to the seventh angel
[1:42:38] ready to breach
[1:42:41] and then he breaks the seal here
[1:42:46] this book is CEO the prophet said in
[1:42:48] heaven
[1:42:53] but he said the thunder sound on Earth
[1:42:59] those are laying there on my desk so
[1:43:00] don't
[1:43:01] worry
[1:43:03] the sound on Earth
[1:43:09] what about it
[1:43:10] are you beginning to realize that What's
[1:43:13] Happening Here is matching what's
[1:43:16] happening what happens to Earth because
[1:43:19] it's beginning to come into the same
[1:43:20] revelation
[1:43:25] plain language
[1:43:30] the throne
[1:43:33] is in our heart
[1:43:37] the one sitting on the throne is
[1:43:39] almighty God who's given eternal life
[1:43:45] now we see
[1:43:47] that we are the book
[1:43:52] in the hand of the one sitting on the
[1:43:54] throne
[1:44:00] are you ready
[1:44:05] we are the what we are the book that's
[1:44:08] going to be revealed to Israel
[1:44:16] honest people going to Israel don't get
[1:44:18] the wrong idea now out there somewhere
[1:44:21] else you better listen because you say
[1:44:23] something I don't say that's your
[1:44:25] business
[1:44:26] I said it the way I mean it
[1:44:29] we are the book that is to be revealed
[1:44:31] to Israel
[1:44:41] what about it
[1:44:46] you think that's a little too strong
[1:44:51] you want to quote for it
[1:44:54] it's over about the seventh sea over
[1:44:56] brother Randall's talking about the 144
[1:44:59] 000 and two witnesses and he tells you
[1:45:01] what they will tell Israel
[1:45:07] should you turned it down back there
[1:45:10] was sitting there with a gentile people
[1:45:12] become the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:16] and said they're going in a Rapture now
[1:45:18] and you're in the tribulation because
[1:45:20] you've rejected
[1:45:22] that
[1:45:24] they turned down the right of sonship
[1:45:26] and they never will have the right of
[1:45:28] friendship again
[1:45:31] there will be servants to the bride
[1:45:34] try
[1:45:36] and we'll never have sonship allotted to
[1:45:40] him again
[1:45:42] we have that friendship the state
[1:45:45] come on music
[1:45:48] like on these things
[1:45:51] just because I'm not a straight
[1:45:53] emotional fast running to tangle your
[1:45:56] spine
[1:46:01] I like for you to think
[1:46:06] you're going to find out one of these
[1:46:08] days I've been preaching all these years
[1:46:09] about you

[1:46:31] you
[1:46:34] then Brother Gary can go back and give
[1:46:36] you page number and paragraph for the
[1:46:37] seals where I said it in 82 and 83.
