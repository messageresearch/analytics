========================================

y'all bear with me just a minute I forgot my notes I have paper notes got too many things to remember so this morning we're going to do a little study about faith because um it's right in line with what everybody's talking about brother Wade ministering to us about adoption by the statue of perfect man being you know Faith being the foundation of that and then brother Aaron talking about on that lesson that we know well we know that only comes from Faith you know from a certainty um he been preaching a really good little series about that and then now brother Bob getting into Hebrews 11 also about faith I don't know exactly what all directions he'll go but you know I just want to keep us meditating on that same thought um right now we're not connecting here so maybe they'll get that going here in a minute my PowerPoint and uh brother Bob was talking about how that Faith uh the whole whole reason that God's word has such strength and such power is because the Integrity of the man Jesus Christ himself because he is truth he is nothing but truth he cannot fail he's all truth I mean to say he cannot fail his work cannot fail so he has this Integrity this character that's steadfast that's sure and that's why his his word has such power and then if you think about it on the opposite side of that the devil the reason his word has no power is because you know he has no Integrity no character he's you know his word uh Satan's word will fail he's nothing but lies and the father of Lies so that's why we don't believe Satan so we going to talk about faith I want to just basically give you an overview broad overview in a short time span and uh what is Faith and how much power it is at at at its fullest form the faith of Jesus Christ himself I just want to give one illustration about that and then talk about how do you get this Faith because he made it available to all of us so what is Faith this is not an exhaustive list this is just a few things that came to my mind when I was making this lesson it's not all that faith is but these are some of the things faith is revelation belief in God when I was a Baptist that's all I knew Faith was is well I believe in God that's Faith but that's the beginning of it but there's more of it that it's a reality it's a positive sense a super sense a long range Vision substance it's the most powerful force uh it's a journey that you're going on and it's a place and that sounds kind of odd so I'm going to talk about that especially in this lesson about faith as being a place or position uh some definitions here about faith relating to Christ a uh strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah through whom we obtain Eternal salvation in the kingdom of God the religious beliefs of Christians belief with the predominant idea of trust or for confidence whether in God or in Christ springing from faith in the same Fidelity faithfulness the character of one who can be relied on that's what brother Bob was talking about the other day um last time he taught Sunday school talking about that we can rely on God more than anything Hebrews 11 definition now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report it doesn't say faith is just the substance you got to be careful not to think that well that's all faith is just the subst things hoped for now like I said faith is a lot of things it's a really broad subject it's a really broad thing and it covers a lot of ground but faith is among other thing it is a substance that's for sure through faith we understand that the world is ref framed by the word of God so the things which are made are not things which are seen are not made were not made of things which do appear the statue perect man brother said no you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see in my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith is impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a reward of them that diligently seek him he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it so that's the beginning of Faith keep that in mind believe in God and that's a choice nobody makes you believe you decide in yourself I'm going to believe believe in Jesus Christ what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life it just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise but first it's got to be Faith let me stay on that foundation for a while Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is a substance of things hoped for is you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith seven substance things hope for the evidence of what is it what kind of evidence a holy evidence and then why Christ speak brother Bron said for you see Faith sees what God wants done so has something to do with the will of God the word of God faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to what to see what God wants done and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that faith is a long range Vision it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target there's a lot in here going to get to about Divine Healing hopefully I got time for all that answers on question answerers on Genesis now back there then this is my example of my illustration of God's faith God spoke his word in creation and he believed his word so he mixed his word with his faith and you're talking about a lot of power um back there then when this little Halo comes now we can't see nothing yet this is Brother B talking about creation but just by eyes of Supernatural we see a Halo standing there now that's the Son of God the logos now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity before him and now then in his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did an Adam bursted and the sun came into existence he whed for hundreds of million years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms if the atomic bomb would ever get loose the atomic chain would take this Ro be like the sun Yonder just bursting and blowing if you could stand over on another continent I guess you could say he's probably meaning like another planet or whatever and look at this it would look like another Sun where the atams was bursting burning this Earth if this chain would ever get loose and it just started turning whirling like that millions and millions of miles in each of these big Flames billions of Fahrenheit of the heat that goes off of that sun Luke 137 just want to quote a scriptures here with God nothing shall be impossible if thou can't believe all things are possible him that believeth keep this in mind as we're talking about this great powerful faith that I'm illustrating here watch this now beautiful how he's made the Sun and then the first thing you know a big Clinger fell off it weighed about just like the Earth here here went then this logos here now the Son of God is watching it here he lets it fall for 100 million years and he stops IT and another one flies off and he lets it flow off fall for millions of years and he stops it now we're standing watching it come into existence now he's got something in his mind and what's he doing he's writing his first Bible I'm going to give you all some little things here I like to look these up every now and then this is interesting it shows you how much God's in control and how powerful he is say the Earth rotates at 1,000 M an hour anybody feel like you're moving 1,000 M an hour right now Earth rotates at 1,000 M an hour Earth orbits around the Sun at 67,000 miles an hour I think we we feel pretty safe and secure though sounds like God's in control Sun orbits the Galaxy our sun and its solar system orbits the whole galaxy of the Milky Way at 500,000 M an hour half a million half a million mil miles an hour the Galaxy is 100,000 Lighty years across this is a big place not the universe I'm talking about our Milky Way galaxy the estimate to be 100,000 light years so if you can go the speed of light 186,000 mil per second for 100,000 years it would take you that's what it would take you to cross this whole galaxy and that's just one Galaxy in this whole universe that this guy made this guy Jesus Christ with this great faith that he mixed his word with his faith and made this big of a place just this one Galaxy out of many there's 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy and each one of them has its own planet or planets orbiting it about 170 billion galaxies in the known universe they don't know the end of it yet they can't find an end of it last I heard but it's a big place then estimated 200 billion trillion Stars so take a trillion 200 billion of those and that's about how many stars in the known universe just what they know of what they can estimate it's a big place a super sense it's the most powerful force that ever hit the earth it's that sense called The Sixth Sense has nothing to do with this down here if this down here ever declares it and this says Amen to it talking about you know our us in our natural senses you know to uh you're moving on but regardless of what this does and you know C taste pH smell here believe that there's where the power if you believe in your heart your fifth sense of than lays within your brain but your six sense lays in your heart you believe with your heart confession is made by the mouth you believe with your heart yes sir that six sense that powerful force un just Limitless power we're talking about here the faith of Jesus Christ and he's trying to give us he gave us each a piece of that we each have that by measure faith is a substance uh faith is only direct and positive sense and it's a six sense faith is more than sight is more than feeling you do not feel Faith you don't don't taste Faith you don't smell Faith you don't see Faith Fai is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen Ministry explained now hope this one thing and faith is another faith is a positive sense it's not a guesswork you don't just imagine it it's just as real as any other sense of your body just the same as sight sight is real hearing is real uh taste feel smell their sense of the body control of the body they're real faculties that if one of them is injured you're say faculties to you if none of them is injured and then faith is just as real as any of these other five senses and more real because it'll go in and above those five senses so how do we get this great faith God condescended in his attributes so we could receive them right so you think of like brother Wade used to say this how do you eat an elephant this is a great big faith and we're wanting to come into this great big faith well how do you eat a great big something like an elephant one B at a time just a little at a time and you can you can do great things just by taking a little bit of this at a time the word of God every day read your Bible and pray every day listen sermons every day just a little bit at a time it's not impossible God condescended in Agape Love by bringing it down to a form Called filal Love or we can get some little grasp of it some little piece of understanding of it same thing with the faith of God he gives us this great big faith and just a little bitty piece for us to understand just just a a little portion of it this childlike Faith just believ in God Romans 12 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith I've got just a few more here and then a video I want to show you all for an illustration Jesus uh Matthew 16 Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and upon this Rock above my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so faith is a revelation and hell is against it but it won't Prevail the angel of God why can't we do that why can't we have that simple faith if we' just be so wouldn't be so trying to figure things out it happen right here just the same God's no respected person he just respects faith brother Aaron quote that the other night God doesn't heal you on the merits of your salvation he heals you on the merits of your faith now here's a quote not from Brother bandam I'll tell you in a minute who it's from if you're a child of God God has to meet you somewhere he's got to he's obligated to his own children if you'll make yourself available say God take me somewhere I want to know more about you y'all know who said that how brother Wade last Sunday okay Matthew 21 and then when the disciples saw it they marveled saying saying how soon is a feig tree wither Jesus answered said to them verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the feig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast to The Sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask and prayer believe and you shall receive faith is our Victory and faith is a victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that and that's the victory what is it it's the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is a victory I still feel sick but faith is a victory it overcomes the world when you can climb into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room that's brother Aaron also quoted that the other night you're still you're sailing free then now that's probably all I'm going to get to of my PowerPoint probably the rest of this will take my illustration here and y'all really pray for me because I have a thought that I really want to get to y'all I really hope I don't run out of time on this so the other day as well was last month I went on a flight I took mercy and IA up to WKA Mountain which is a mountain between kind of between Cleveland and Gainesville and we live close to WKA Mountain I've lived close to Walka Mountain since I was a little since I was about two years old I've always lived within about 10 or 20 miles I've watched it my whole life I went to walkill elementary school it's just always been a part of my life so I thought I'll take our girls and we'll do a little sightseing we'll fly over walk a mountain then over our house and the next month I took our other two Harmony and Ula flew them over the mountain same and over our house but there was a big difference between the two times we went the first time it was sunset and it was just overbearing so much light it was blinding and the midst over the mountains around WKA Mountain and all these mountains all around were just obscured from my view I didn't even notice them I I knew they were there but I didn't even notice them we just taking pictures and videos then we went back and landed the next time I said where did all these mountains come from cuz all of a sudden it was overcast it was raining a little bit when we got around the backside what I call the backside of walking mountain the side opposite from the view of our house it was kind of raining on us and it was clouds and all of a sudden we could see really clear for miles and miles around okay and I saw all these other mountains and I didn't hardly notice talk about now I'm looking at all these other mountains in this range of I guess North Georgia Mountains Blue Ridge Mountains whatever all the mountains they were and I thought wow there's something to this so I went back and looked at the video and I figured out why it was it's because there was too much lights on that first flight so I said wow there's something spiritual about that too if you think about it there's a lot of symbology in that when you come to faith in Christ at the very beginning when you believe you've come into a place remember I talked the beginning about it Faith being a place you've come into this place and there's all these mountains but at the beginning you cannot not see them because they're shrouded in unbelief all you see at the very beginning because of that mist of sin all you see is maybe one mountain justification and if you keep around that one mountain long enough walk a mountain by the way is named after a man named Walker his last name was Walker you think about walking as a Christian Journey you have to keep walking right you start believing in faith justification that mount justification you come to that first Mountain just keep on around that until you see Mount sanctification come into view when you see that mountain now you've got two mountains in this whole big place called Faith there's a lot more out there that you don't see but you keep on going on this journey you come to mount baptism of Holy Spirit you'll come to mount stature of perfect man you come to mount U you know faith for for Divine Healing for anything you have need of everything you have need of in Earth's journey is given you when you're born again but you have to drink and push out just keep on going on this journey and walking is reading the Bible and praying every day it's coming to church it's listening to sermons keep on that journey and you'll see these other mountains come into view I had no hope look like as a Baptist kid when I was 12 and gave my heart to the Lord came to that mount justification all I saw was walk a mountain I just kept walking and then one day I started reading my Bible every day and all of a sudden I came to sanctification the washing Water by the word I saw Mount sanctification come into view I kept going and I saw Mount baptism the holy spirit in 2015 and I kept going and I had no idea about this message that laid up ahead of me down the road you know in 200 too that was long in my journey and and all these other mountains you don't know what kind of mountains you're going to come to in your journey there's mountains of Victory mountains of um Revelation M well each one of these is really a revelation but there's all these little mountains of overcoming depression and and lust and and fear and and anxiety and all these other kind of mountains these Mountaintop experiences you have but ironically the thing that kept me at the beginning at this first flight from seeing those mountains was the light the sunlight was overbearing and God knows how much light you can handle at one time so he gives you just a little at a time but that light was blind to me and it was obscuring the view of the mountains so I couldn't see them but if I once I when I kept going I could see there's other things come into view just keep these type of things in mind as we're y'all can play the sound I don't know that'll work if they can't get sound going that's okay but that's me and mercy and IA on that first flight also I'll mention too last Sunday brother John durett mentioned patiently waiting on God's timing oh yeah got you thank you what's up if y'all don't get it going that's no problem it's no big deal I can just keep talking walking over it cuz you'll still get the point just from watching it but mountains are symbolic of permanent things because you know that anytime you think of a mountain you think of something permanent something big and solid it's always going to be there until someone has Faith to move mountains you know it's always going to be standing right there you know you can always rely that that Mountain's going to be in the same spot every time you look in that same area and when you have all these permanent things that justification of mine in when I was 12 was permanent I knew when I gave my heart to the Lord at 12 I'm going all the way with the Lord I'm never going to stop if I live to be 100 years old I'm still going to be serving Christ I knew that as a little Baptist kid not knowing about everything that laid my journey not knowing that I come to the message not knowing that I come to something called sanctification that was not even in my psyche there was there nobody even taught that in the Baptist Church they said just plead the blood you can't help what you do just plead the blood which literally means just keep messing up keep doing the wrong things you do cussing whatever else you do wrong just plead the blood ask God to forgive you you'll be all right but that was that first flight and there's you can kind of see the form the shape of the mountains off in the Horizon but you can't see him clearly as we could on this next flight and then we started on that next flight though it was cloudy though it was even raining at times we got On The Backs Side of the Mountain like this backside of the desert experience and all of a sudden these other mountains came into clear you that was youa flying the plane and while that's still going I'll go ahead and start talk about this most important one I want to get to is Mount Divine Healing I came to mount Divine Healing somewhere in about 2015 or 2016 most of you don't well maybe some of you have heard a little bit over the years uh I've battled on and off with ulcer of kidus which is ulcers in the colon bleeding ulcers and in 2015 I had the worst episode of it ever and I didn't as far as I recall if I did anything at all here I probably turn in prayer request like an unspoken I learned a long time ago faith for Divine Healing is basically two things you believe in your heart confess with your mouth and both those are to me are equally important so uh I wouldn't go around whining and complaining and even telling anybody my my mindset has always been on just keeping my mouth shut about it I'm just if anything I might say pray for me I'm having a problem but I'm not going to talk about all the circumstances and I'm going to do my best to act like I'm Healed until my body agrees with it and uh when I listen to brother Brandon for the 40th time talking about brother John Ryan finally it quickened to me and the sort of the midst of my unbelief rolled away and I saw Mount healing like I'd never seen it before am Mount Divine Healing in plain view all of a sudden I realized was you believe God no matter what no matter what happens no matter how low you get you keep believing God and stand there in faith and believe in God no matter what and don't confess the circumstances John Ryan came up for prayer about being blind and he went away and he was brother Bron said you're healed and he went away and he still couldn't see so he came back to The Altar and he said I thought you said I was healed brother B said I thought you said you believed when that was Quicken to John Ry he went away and all of a sudden started confessing it until it happened and I believe he would have confessed it if his eyes never came open because he had the Revelation that it's a long range Vision you see that you're healed even if your body don't declare it no matter what happens you see that you're healed and you accept it and you believe it no matter what and um then brother bandam himself had that stomach ailment that was terrible and he was living on a liquid diet finally he said well I'd rather die you know if I I want to eat solid food if it kills me basically I think is what he said on one place I heard him say so he started eating solid food and the doctor told him it would kill him he did it anyway and it tried to come back up and he swallowed it back down it came back up and he swallowed it back down so finally somebody say how you doing brother Ben he say I'm doing well you know praise the Lord for healing me or whatever and he kept acting like he was healed even though his body didn't didn't say that that he was healed but yet he acted like he was healed and I had a similar thing with this uh one of these episodes of um bleeding ulcers losing a lot of blood and even being basically borderline anemic weak and feverish and everything else and not saying a word to anybody here the only one that knew it was Gabby and um I wouldn't say a word to anybody I just keep confessing that I'm Healed and now I'm perfectly fine not a not not a symptom at all but I won't stop if it shows up again tomorrow I'll still be saying thank you Lord for healing me just obviously I have sister Fred on my mind a lot so um just keep her in mind that's why I mentioned that it's for mostly for her and um we're all standing with her in prayer amen that's the first flight that shows you just how much the mountains and everything was obscured by that by that uh mist and the sun lightened up and everything you musicians can go ahead and come up and the second flight there still was Mist over the mountains but we could still see them because the sun was not shining on them so bright so when you're going through those cloudy days and even some rain just know that God has a plan he has a purpose for all that he's got this all under control he knows what he's doing God bless y'all thank [Applause] you
