praise the Lord Jesus we're going to go ahead and go to the word this evening and uh we just thank God hopefully the Lord's blessed you throughout the week so far we were blessed with the word this this past weekend we appreciate that word from Brother brother uh Daniel as well enjoyed that so um before we go to prayer I want to ask you all to just remember us in your prayers as we uh we'll be we'll be traveling here in about a week and a half or so preaching a three three-day service in in Toronto Canada so you just remember us in your prayers believe n is coming with us and I think Michael is flying in up there as well they're having Youth service a youth some youth meetings up there so I'll be ministering Frid next Friday night and next Saturday and then Sunday as well so remember me in your prayers am that God God would just have his way amen and um and so we're going to go ahead and uh read the scriptures this evening but let's just go to the Lord in prayer first most kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to open back the pages of your word and Lord Jesus father we we we know Lord God Almighty that you are in your word father because you are the word Lord you are the author heavenly father and and because you're the author Lord Jesus you can give the revelation of what you wrote here father God Lord let the life father God of these words pop out from these Pages this evening Lord God and Lord um give us a revelation of your word father because without Revelation Lord God Almighty we we cannot do anything father God from the Heart Lord Jesus but with Revelation Lord God Almighty then lord it's something genuine something real and I pray Lord that you just help us to be genuine real Christians because we we want to be Lord God and I just ask heavenly father that you just have your way Lord here this this evening forgive us for all of our sins Lord God where we fail you Lord where we maybe got in the flesh Lord God or thought something maybe that we shouldn't have Lord or even said something that wasn't pleasing to you we ask for forgiveness Lord we ask that you would cleanse us father and place those things under the blood of Jesus Christ so that Heavenly Father you'd have your way here amongst us Lord we can't save ourselves we can't forgive our own sins but Lord you did it all for us so we we have no need to do that Lord but father we plead you Lord we plead the blood of Jesus Christ this evening granted Lord Jesus continue to meet the needs amongst us and we love you and we commit this time into your hands and my lips in your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you amen I thought that that that we would continue from last time uh the matters of the heart um so we're going to um we're going to continue that and this is part two and and Saints the reason why why why why I look at this just right before the the we read the word is because I believe that um I believe that everything that we do amen stems from from the heart everything that you think everything that moves you everything that ticks in your life is is is is is from is from the heart there's a there's a root of of everything that we do and everything that who we are and it comes from the heart and and and it's and that's a genuine way to live life but there is a fake way to live life and the Pharisees give us a good example about that and so we just want to maybe touch upon that this evening so let's just read the word in in Proverbs chapter 4 the Bible says here my son attend verse 20 my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my says this is pro this is this is uh Solomon the wisest man that have that has ever lived saying these things these things to his son incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart verse 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life amen you may be seated this evening amen I like the way the the way uh Solomon says it here he says incline thine ear unto my sayings and in other words he's telling his son he says in other words take importance or or or be hopefully what I'm saying to you is interesting because when something is interesting you you want to get a little bit closer to here right you incline your your your you get a little bit uh uh I what was that brother Boyd I couldn't hear you you see because you you you're interested in what they had to say right or you want them to repeat again what they wanted to say and so that's what that's what Solomon is trying to tell his son here incline thine ear in other words show interest in what I want to tell you amen and that's what we want to do this evening amen is I hope that instead of us doing this we do this amen incline our ears Amen to to hear what the word has to say not what I have to say but but what the word says amen because the word has life in it how many believe that Jesus said that my words are spirit and they are life so if they have life or if they are life that means they life changing right they should change your life if you really take them to heart but if we if we're not paying attention then they won't change us so we want to pay attention amen so he says here my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings and he he he could say that because God gave him wisdom amen was the wisest man that has ever lived upon this face of the of of the earth we know that how he ended up how he ended up and I I never could understand the wisest man but ended up the way he did it just goes to show amen we all need the Holy Ghost if it ain't without the Holy Ghost if it ain't with without God in our soul which Solomon didn't have amen he had an anointing upon him he had a form of salvation but he didn't he could not enjoy the benefits of the new birth like you and I can right I don't believe that a man with the genuine New Birth would end up being the way s uh Solomon ended up uh in his life you know with with letting women dragging him to serving other gods and things like that and that's how he ended up being but at this point you know but yet God deemed it that his words were so precious and so so w wise to give us a book ecclesiastics is another one amen and of course here in the Book of Proverbs so there very wise sayings and he says here let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart and we're just we're just doing just a little review from last time amen and and and then we'll continue where we left off last time for they are for they are life amen the these words are life unto those that find them right and in order for you to find something you have had to been looking for it correct you know it that's how you if you're really Desiring something if you're really looking for something you're going to find it it's what Jesus said in his word amen seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you praise God so I I God wants us to knock God wants us to seek God wants us to to to to receive and not just read the word and open the word listen to the message and not get anything out of it and I'm afraid a lot of us do that amen we don't get anything out of it because we don't look at things with Revelation Lord I'm opening your word reveal to me your heart amen reveal to me your heart amen because your heart is is in this word amen his heart is in his word amen for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh and verse 23 is the key verse here keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life out of your heart amen and we talked about last time that that uh that out of your heart is really you can be doing something or you can be saying something but in reality what are you in your heart you can be putting on but let's see what you do when you're alone amen that's the real you then right that's the real you and so that's what we want to have amen is we the way we are in public is the way we are alone amen the way we are when we're in school is the way we want to be when we're at church the way we are at work is the way we want to be when we're at church amen we don't want to be amen put on praise God God help us amen because it's easy to be to to to to be that way it's easy to lean that way amen live one life at church and then live live another life at school believe me I did that on live one life at work live one life at at church amen praise God in the good news translation it says be careful how you think your life is shaped by your thoughts right and and that's that's very true amen your life life the way you are where you are now is because you you you thought to be this way amen uh you you you you you the choices that you made throughout your lifetime brought you to where you are now amen and and it's what it's what now we know that it's the guidance of the Lord amen and you're in church tonight amen and you're at a good place amen amen praise the Lord I don't see anybody here half robing and flies flying out of their mouth you know and drunk and praise God thank God but you know you one of some of us could have been that way we could have been in an insane institution tonight right now some some some mental health hospital right now amen but it wasn't deemed by God Amen it wasn't his will for you to go that way amen it wasn't for you to for in God's will for you to go by the grave when you were 19 20 25 years old 30 years old amen I I you know I I was I may have given this testimony before but when I was out in the world and and drinking and there was one night where I was out partying with with my friends after I got off work from Papa John's Pizza closing up I went out and they invited me to go drink and stuff and and I did and and and and so here I am and and so it was like 2: 3 in the morning my friends are drunk well I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm drunk their girlfriends are drunk and here they are and they're like do you need to ride home and no I there was no way for me to get home so I just got in their car and I don't even know how we got home but they I got home and I just see that as the the grace of God anything could have happened but by the but if it wasn't for his grac amen amen and so this you know we're here because by his grace we thank God for that amen so we we talked about in also in Matthew chapter 12 it says uh uh Jesus saying oh Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good things in other words Jesus is saying how can how can things good things come out of your heart when there is evil in your heart because if that is the if that's the ca if that's the the if that's what's happening amen then you're putting on or you're being a hypocrite right praise God so that's what he's saying here oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh amen so in other words what you feed upon what you look at what what is uh um you're feeding your mind with amen is what eventually will come out of your life right right praise the Lord is what eventually will come out of your life and so he continues to say here Jesus saying a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart so there is a good treasure but then there is a evil treasure as he as he mentioned here out of the the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things in other words you feed on good things you're going to produce good things right amen you you you watch good things you're going to produce good things right it's going to stimulate your influence you and I've been looking at a little bit at influence and and the importance of influence and how we influence one another and and the things that influence us and how we influence other people you see and so if we allow things from the outside amen this outside world that that that are controlled by Satan a lot of it is amen they're going to influ if you let that just influence you and take you over and you become one with those things then you're don't be surprised that you're going to start acting like those things right amen there's a spirit behind everything sir amen right you know I see a I see a person riding a motorcycle out here you know last Sunday when they were out here riding motorcycles and when I go out here and looking at people riding the motorcycle I'm not expecting to see a man in a suit riding a motorcycle there there there's a certain atmosphere that comes with riding with you know Riders you know not I'm not saying not everyone I'm just saying you look at people out that they're usually wearing black vests and black leather and and have long beards and their beards waving over here you know as they're riding and and uh um you know they have maybe some woman behind him and the woman's wearing a tank top and that's the spirit that comes with that I wasn't going to look out I'm not expecting to go out there there and look and see a man with a suit and a tie and a briefcase right right next to him no because that's the spirit that goes along with that amen right you hear somebody you hear somebody some hip-hop music out here out in the parking lot you there's a spirit that goes with that right there's a spirit that goes with everything you see and and it makes you identify things for the spirit that is around there you see and so that's why that's why it's so important that Jesus said good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things right there's this vessel of of of of uh of good treasure that you should have right and what's filling it with good treasure or good things it's because you're feeding on good things you're putting good things in there right and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things so here's an evil man here's another person with a with a vessel or 50-gallon drum full of evil things but how did those evil things get in there come now brother right how did those evil things get in there because they put evil things in there amen and so what's going to come out of your your your your 50 gallon drum or your out of you you're the 50 gallon drum what's going to come out of you young people what's going to come out of you evil things amen 1+ 1 equals 2 right so that's what Jesus is talking about so it's very it's very strange that you're seeing someone that you're expecting for certain things to come out of that person because by the way they they dress or by the way they talk by the way but then they're talking a different way yeah they're talking very they they're talking very Maybe Christlike very but yet they dress certain way they look a certain way they might even smell a certain way right and it doesn't it doesn't jive right and so that's what Jesus is trying to say amen amen praise God so we see here and and these are these are my row notes like last times amen so I got a little arrows here now so we were looking at Proverbs 4:23 of what the heart of of of this verse was and it was what was this verse amen and it was it was talking about the heart the how it was to keep with to keep it with all diligence right amen and then the why is of this verse is because out of it comes all the issues of life amen amen you are who you are because of your heart amen it's in your heart that that's who you are amen you are you you are the real you in your soul amen and so that's that that's the reason why we need to guard it with everything that we got amen right that's why we read our Bible pray every day that's why we feed on the word amen because that is helping us guard it with diligence amen a a and so in order for us to be diligent with something amen you have to be constant with something praise God and so that's what that's what Solomon was saying keep thy heart with all diligence in other words with everything that you have and it's like it's like the the Lord told us in in in in in in the Ten Commandments love your God with all thine heart and with all thy Soul amen and with all thy mind you see that that doesn't mean with with with one quarter of your heart or one quarter of your soul or one quarter of your mind no it means with everything that you got amen everything that you are amen that's how you love him amen and that's what he's trying to tell us here amen keep thy heart or in other words watch over your heart with all diligence amen and brother Brandon would talk about you know how we would go uh to a restaurant and we would and if we find a a um a spider in our in our soup that we order or or or some animal floating in there some insect and he'd say you almost would sue the the the the restaurant right if you went to Waffle House and that happened you probably will but but some people would would actually maybe sue the restaurant right but we just let we'll let anything amen be crammed down our souls and we won't say anything amen we would just let anything we read anything we watch anything and and and it's feeding our soul it's feeding who you really are and then you're wondering why why am I acting this way or or or thinking this way why am I depressed why is it that why why why am I living my life this way it's because of what you're putting in your 50 gallon drum amen through the media through the internet through through through the through everything that you watch read listen to amen it's what you're put so therefore out of your 50 gallon drum when you go in there and see what's what's what's really in my soul and that's what you get out of it's a bunch of black black chalk amen right and no gold right and you wonder why amen amen so keep your heart with all diligence amen I know I'm mainly talking maybe to our young people here tonight but I'm going tell you some of us adults we have a problem with this too you might been in the message 40 50 years amen that doesn't mean anything you still you still amen need to get a revelation for yourself amen praise God because uh it's very very very uh uh dangerous to keep to keep put this thing on cruise control as I've said in the past amen so the meaning of keep here is to watch to guard to keep to preserve to guard from dangers Amen to keep observed guard with Fidelity amen and I had talked about last time with regards to a person uh uh a Watchman amen when they would watch the enemy coming and they were guarding the the the Tower and they were watching for the enemy to come they weren't waiting for the enemy to get to them or to the door of the castle for them to do something no they watch it from afar off and then if they see the enemy coming or if they see uh something that looks evil or something that's going to hinder their Kingdom amen they go and address that right away you don't sweep it under the rug and say I'll wait I'll do something about it later no you you you address it right there and then that's when it needs to be take get taken care of Amen not not next year amen you see an issue with your with your teenager you see an issue with your with amen take care of it right there and there because it's not it's going to be hard the next year or the following year amen take care of it right there and then amen amen yeah it's it's it's it's tough CU you just don't want to to to to to Shake The Wasp Nest so to speak you don't want to you don't want to stir the pot so to say it's better when things are you know just amen but sometimes it's good to stir the pot amen that's if it's going to stir you the right way yeah I believe that with all my heart you know Jesus didn't mince words with the Pharisees he told them the way things were he told them he told them exactly who you are what you are who and you of your father the devil you're snakes you're and and and sometimes in this day the age that we're living in we we we got a tiptoe around people nowadays I don't I don't know if I want to I want to go there or not but you shouldn't be doing that [Music] yeah I don't think we we should deal with people that's the reason why people are the way they are now they run right all over you you know we were at the uh I don't remember where we were the other day and oh yeah we were at Ikea the other day and and these parents nowadays you know I I'm they just tiptoe with their kids and like you know a kid there crying because he wanted a some some big stuffed animal and he's just crying making a scene and the parents now come on Johnny come on now now we know that we're not supposed to do that Christine was like I would have taken my belt right there and then yeah I would have taken care of business right there I would have stopped that nonsense right away but we you know nowadays we don't do that we just want to tiptoe around our kids you know we don't want to we don't want to uh uh offend them it's good that they get offended they'll appreciate you more when they when they get older I I my parents didn't do that to me and I I love my parents nowadays right I love what when my mom amen that she and she got upset you know she took care of business right there and then you know and this was before she was a Christian she'd throw whatever she'd see right there you know when she became a Christian she tried to work on that but I know it was hard especially with the kind of kid I was but we don't want to we we we ruin more our kids when we when when when we don't address things right away we have to address things right away and same thing with adults amen Sometimes some adult you know offends you amen we wait till and we let that fester in you instead of you addressing it right there and then listen brother listen sister I don't like the way you talked to me the other day I didn't like your spirit I it offended me I I'm sorry that I'm having to stir the pot so to speak but address it right away because let me tell you what happens when you expose things that changes situations that's right that changes and that has that has a a a a potential for hearts to be changed right and that's how you expose things it's hard but it's got to be done amen God gave us amen a mouth to to to to speak and gave us a uh you know uh sometimes you know hear ears to hear you see to listen and so something happen amen that that doesn't that just rubs you the wrong way instead of letting that fester and and and that Spirit just kind of in the in the church house and it'll affect the people it'll affect you amen if you don't get it taken care of right there and then I didn't even have plans to talk about that amen but so so he says here amen keep keep the heart with all diligence amen so let's continue here amen we're we're very diligent with a lot of things as I said you know we're very diligent with keeping your car and keeping your home amen keeping you very diligent because you want to get married you know diligent to look good and feel good but we're not diligent enough Amen to keep our heart my and that's what we should be keeping above anything else amen but Solomon is saying but above all guard your heart your inner life your soul amen that's what we should be doing praise God now let me just continue here so in other words you you will be made or broken according to what happens in your heart and these are my my notes here every one of life's great issues events problems or victories successes or Etc at the roots stem from being a matter of the Heart Right amen it's all a matter of the heart amen it's who you really are praise God brother brand say say it like this as I was saying a few days ago either here or somewhere speaking on the L detector now notice close now I want you to pay close attention put a lie detector on you and you try to impersonate that truth and try to say that it's truth but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called the soul and this intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you and it's very incapable of bringing you to God your mind amen amen it can't bring you to God or in other words you're you're you're you're you're you're thinking amen you're thinking uh your reasoning your five senses outer senses and your five inner senses amen can't can't bring you to God Amen that's not where where life can reside or God's word can reside God's word can only reside in the soul amen and that's who you really are praise God and every one of us comes Amen in this life amen with that little snake in our in our in our soul that brother brandom talked about in in I believe it was in the Statue of the perfect man where he drew the little snake there and so that snake amen has to that's your heart right there and so that's the reason why the little baby amen automatically starts lying and you didn't teach it to lie that's that's the reason why they automatically start cheating and start doing those things you didn't teach it that it came with that already in it the root of evil and then so that's the reason why we need the new birth to root that out amen it's like it's like roor Rooter amen just just root it out take that out amen and and and but you can't just take it out amen then something else has to go in and replace it amen and that's why Jesus said let this mind of Christ be in you what is that mind amen that mind is life amen that mind is the word amen that mind amen is what will change you amen from the inside out because you can take the snake out but then don't fill it with good things then you'll just have an empty 50-gallon drum man but we want to fill it with good things amen hence the reason why we come to church and hence the reason why we read the word and we stay we stay in the word we listen to messages we we stay in Fellowship Amen in order to keep feeling that 50-gallon drum with what good things so that what so that good things can come out later amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen and so brother Bram says here you cannot know God by your mind or intellectual it's one of the resources or the channels that would lead to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul amen and so Proverbs 23:7 says for as he thinketh a man thinketh in his heart so is he and that that that's what you are amen I like this at what Marcus aelia said the soul is died the color of its thoughts the soul is died the color of its thoughts it's whatever you think about not in day amen it's what you are and it's what you'll express praise God but if God's in there amen you'll express God yes right amen if Christ is in your Li in your heart amen you'll be you'll express Christ more you'll have an interest for the word natural interest for the word amen amen and it it just won't be it won't it won't be something that that's mundane and boring amen but it'll be something that that's genuine amen that comes Amen in a genuine way praise God and we talked about last time about the difference between reputation and character and reputation is what people think you are amen but character is what God knows you are as he looks upon your heart amen and we all we and that's what the the Pharisees they had a problem with is them keeping their reputation they wanted to look good on the outside but they were full of Dead Man's Bones on the inside they were rotten on the inside amen so so it it that that that is a heart problem there amen because whatever is whatever is in the heart really wants to come out out of them but they suppress it when they were around the people right and you don't know you didn't know what was going on Amen when the people weren't around you see and so and so that that is what Jesus had to fight with them constantly amen and he had to he always spoke to them about the matter of their heart because he knew their hearts he knew that they were evil on the inside and and yet showed this this this uh this facade on the outside you see and and we don't want to we don't want to be that way Saints amen we want to be as genuine as we call because the holy spirit is genuine God is genuine I believe so do you believe that you know there is some genuine people that that you that you come across and that you meet in life and and and you really see that they genuinely do things Amen in a genuine way and and you gravitate towards those people there's something that you gravitate towards genuiness amen righten but when something is not genuine but it's just put on Amen the Holy Spirit In You picks up on that amen and you don't want to gravitate on that and that's the reason why Jesus and the and the Pharisees they they they they uh they clashed because he was the word exposing their sin exposing who they really are he knew their thoughts he knew their hearts amen and it classed with who he was and who he is and he is life right praise the Lord Jesus and so that's what people want to do nowadays amen is keep their reputation on Facebook and on social media they want to show themselves in a certain way Amen on on uh the pictures that they put on and the family pictures and everything's hunky dory and just fine but let's go to their house amen let's see how things are if they are really that way in their house and so that's what social media is amen yes sir everybody wants to be a social influencer you want to influence your people's lives with with with the way you portray yourself and it it makes people like oh man I wish I had that I wish I could go where they're at oh my but they don't know that you are $50,000 in debt yeah after going to that place or buying that car yeah right they don't know that that you are uh you know the things that you had to you know you have to set your your kids you know financial future aside just to get that house you know uh they just see the house that's all the people see and that's all they you know oh wow they must have money but in reality it's not that way I'm hitting brother John sermons right here right now [Laughter] you but that's what social media is it's just a place to be fake now I'm not saying everybody is fake there there is genuine people that genuinely put real things that there but it's an opportunity for you to be fake and to be a a modern-day Pharisee right yeah but but but we don't want to be that way amen we want we want to be true amen amen true character amen and so true true character lies in the heart's Purity amen it's deceiving to to think what happens inside doesn't matter as long as the outside looks clean amen it's deceiving to think that way amen you must whatever is on the inside has to show forth on the outside Jesus said in Matthew 15:19 for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile a man these are the things that are in your 50 gallon drum if you're not born again amen right automatically praise the Lord Jesus and what what's in in the heart it ruins you outwardly as well Saints amen what's in your heart amen it ruins you uh on the outside as well amen uh you you you know speaking about speaking about influence amen you you know when somebody's drunk I used to work at Papa John's Pizza and we had a a a uh a bar right next to the the restaurant and when they would come in you know and order a pizza and they were stumbling and stuff like that and just kind of looking at you and man give me a pepperoni you know where they have been you can't say they've been to church because when you've been in church amen you and there's a there's another influence there right the influence of the holy spirit amen could also cause you to do that way amen but it it won't bring a reproach to to you amen it'll actually get on in somebody else amen and make them do that you know amen but but you know where somebody's been when when when they when when they stumbling and they smell like alcohol you know what they've been feeding on right you know what what what you know they who they are what they what they are amen by the way they look and by the way they're acting amen do the people out here know who you are amen by the way you act do they do they do they know amen genuinely know amen that person amen has is really a genuine Christian but because they've been to church I know they've been to church and it's not because you wore the suit and tie amen but it's because of the way you act amen praise the Lord amen so so yeah with a drunk person amen that that what they they're that way because they have let whatever is in their heart amen for alcohol to ruin them on the outside you see and it's the same thing with us amen amen whatever we allow in our lives amen uh uh to just ruminate in our heart amen it will ruin us on the outside it will show forth on the outside amen what is what you're feeding on Amen I look at Sometimes some of our young people sometimes they just kind of look depressed and they look they just look sad I just I can't help to think amen what are they feeding on that makes them look so sad make him look so depressed make him look so so uh they're like there's no life there and then you go back and you look at what they're watching and they're all into anime and they're all into all that stuff that's dark and and weird and and death and and all kinds of stuff and oh that's why CU when you're around death you're going to act like death right when you're around those types of things you're going to act like what you're what you're around with you see amen so whatever don't so you can't think whatever you're feeding on doesn't show on the outside or won't it won't ruin you it does ruin you and it will show on the outside amen praise God and Jesus said in Matthew 12:35 a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and we were we were just talking about that amen it may take a while for it to manifest but it will amen amen what's in the heart will eventually be manifested outward amen and we could try to suppress it I give the example of the rice cooker last time amen and then when you can you can cook the rice and eventually get to a point where it's boiling and and and that lid wants to come off amen and you can you can press that that that lid down but eventually that steam's going to start coming out from somewhere and it's going to sit there and start roaring amen why because there's something inside that wants to come out amen eventually whatever is in your heart you can suppress it for a while but whatever really is in your heart it'll come out it's some point let the heat really be be be turned up right the heat of the pressure of the of the of the matter of whatever is happening amen let that let that let that heat be turned up whatever is really in your heart will come out and you can't hide it am you can only hide it for a certain time for a certain season eventually it will come out it was the same thing with the Pharisees they could hide it in front of the people for many many years for a long time until the word came on the scene they couldn't hide it anymore and that's why the word that's why we need to preach the word amen the word exposes the error amen amen the word exposes the error amen and it it and and it should be that way amen praise the Lord praise God now so what it what is inside the treasury of the heart will eventually spill out amen we have heard of terrible spiritual tragedies amongst churches ministers well-respected people I know we've all heard those things amen throughout our life as we've served people you realize amen how in the world could brother so and so come to that place where they're at now amen they were just so on fire for God and they were just amen just seemed like they were preaching the message and now they they they they talk against it and and making YouTube videos against the message how how could it happen well at some point amen they something got in the heart that they accepted in the heart amen and and and and it's it's it's okay amen if it comes to the thought and you think about it and and that is the filter right there but when you let that thing amen come to the heart that that changes things amen it's all right the the the the the the bird is brother Bram said the bird can come and put the and and be hovering around amen but when you let that bird lay on you amen and lays the egg and builds the nest and everything that's a different story then eventually whatever is in that egg will come to manifest amen what we we will come to fruition and so we we' we've seen that and we think amen why my that was such a sudden tragedy but in reality it wasn't it was something that took place little at a time little by little because you allowed it amen something that person allowed it a long time ago in their heart amen whatever it is whatever it may be true brother amen and so we Pro probably we knew the whole story we would see that it wasn't really sudden at all it was a process in the heart that started as a trickle amen right amen it starts as a thought a funny little feeling a sensation outwardly now I got these little arrows here and then next thing you know then you have the choice to accept it or reject it in the heart see God gives you the choice to that's come before you so what are you going to do about it amen right you have the choice you always have free moral agency even when you become a Christian amen free Mor God doesn't take free moral agency away from you now these things will come into your life amen and then if you accept it then it becomes part of you or your soul right amen so one thing leads to the other amen and before you know it you are nurturing it and you're cuddling it and pampering it in the heart that's the evil treasure amen how cute don't you touch it and that's what we've become sometimes and man just cuddling that thing and then when the word exposes it you get mad you you you get upset and you and and you want to storm off or you leave the church for a while because you got upset but the problem is not with the preacher or the church the problem is you amen the problem is in the heart is is it's you see it's me amen until the right moment comes where that thought has to come to manifest itself outwardly amen so you look at somebody amen that came that committed adultery or or or did something eventually that that's that that spirit that started in the heart somewhere first amen then it eventually it manifests in the action right it wasn't something that just amen no none of us amen uh were born in this world Amen and think one day I'm going to commit adultery on my on my partner or on my wife or on my on my no something eventually amen start that started little little by little you allowed something in your heart amen and you started thinking about that then eventually became a little baby that you're rocking and cuddling amen and it comes into fruition put whatever XYZ in there amen but it's a matter of the heart amen it's always a matter of the heart amen and so 1 Corinthians 10:12 tells us this wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall in other words if you think that you're strong amen so strong amen you better you better double down on on on what you you better know that you know that what you got amen because the person that you thought wasn't going to do those things ended up doing them that brother that you that you that solid brother that solid sister you thought just wouldn't fall ended up ended up falling right and that's why we need to pray for one another pray for us ministers pray for us amen those that that that have a position in in church and and things like that because Satan would just want to ruin amen through through the through the pastor through the the the ministry amen and ruin the reputation of a church by something like that amen but it starts from the heart amen praise God am man that's one of the reasons Saints and I just tell I tell I tell you this because you all know as is is one of the reasons why I like to take my wife with me on mission trips I don't want to give I don't want to give Avenue to the devil you go some of those countries and you see some of those sisters and there's some of those sisters are in need yeah they don't have sometimes their husbands are not Christians they're they're they're drunks they and and they need attention and they will get your attention especially when you come from the United States the land of opportunity and so you and so having my wife there it puts that that block right there and you shouldn't even be with a sister by yourself somewhere anyways amen that that shouldn't even be cuz you you're you're allowing Satan Amen to to to get in maybe you don't do anything but you thought about it and when you think about it that gives an opportunity to go into the heart and you don't want that amen so that's that's uh that is a uh that's something that that we chose we decided together a long time ago to do that cuz some people ask me why do you take your wife to the mission trips well that's one of the reasons M and and it has worked thank God and the other reason is that she can minister to to people that with the sisters that I can't talk to them about things that I can't talk to them about but she can you see and so it's a double double uh what is it the the the what is Batman and Robin [Laughter] was yeah the dynamic do amen that's that's my wife go are there she's working too amen so praise God but but this verse here in in 1 Corinthians 10:12 it says let for let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall Amen in other words like what we're talking about in Proverbs 4:23 keep thy heart with all diligence amen so you and in doing that you're taking heed so that you don't fall amen amen right you're taking heed that so that that is uh that is the new testament's way of saying Proverbs 4:23 praise God we can read also in in 1 Peter 589 be sober be vigilant amen Vigilant amen is somebody awake somebody that that is watching amen every corner and is studying the enemy amen not just not just not just let's say a me a boxer amen that's boxing he's gonna study the moves that that that his opponent has amen he's not just waiting there to for the day of the match to to go ahead and let me get the surprise of how they move or or what kind of Defense they use no he has studied his opponent very thoroughly and that opponent has studied the him Satan has studied you amen ever since you were born yes sir now he knows you amen but he just can't get in that heart amen if if the holy spirit is dwelling in there amen he he he he he he wants that heart amen more than anything else but if you allow the Holy Spirit to come in amen and take preeminence amen Satan amen sealed out amen and God is sealed in amen praise God be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion amen not as a sloth notice that doesn't say that there not as a a a slow walking sloth amen but as a roaring lion walketh about seeking who he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith in other words be be be uh be just ready to to to resist when you know it's Satan amen and don't even give him a chance praise God Amen don't even give him a chance amen so if if sin amen and and and we'll we'll finish up up with here in just a moment if sin and the effects thereof is a heart issue right then it must be that salvation and the effects is also a hard issue as well right amen amen and look what look what Romans says in in Romans 10 n verse 9 it says that if thou and you just put your name right here that if amen Christine amen that if Zoey or that if Bella that Nyla that of brother Aaron amen that is sister Susan brother Wade I'm go on this side now brother Boyd that is that of sister Janine amen that is Sister Gabby shall confess with their mouth that the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart right that's where you believe out of that's where you receive the word of God sir right that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen right but in order for you to do that you have to hear the word of God first just as you heard it just now now you know the instructions of what to do now it's up to you to do this am that will show if this has become a revelation to you when you go and do it right correct amen you know we always heard this this scripture in the in the Baptist Church many times you know for the for you know telling others about salvation and and and you don't really but when you start looking at the word In a Different Light amen that that that pops out to you amen that if you that if you confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved not that maybe you will or that there's a 50% chance that there's a you know that thou shalt be saved this is this is what you have to do and it doesn't look hard to me we're the ones that make it hard it can't be that easy it it's that easy it's just listen listen to the word hear the word and if it has become a revelation to you amen you're going to put this to action amen for what verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation that's why it's so important amen for you to confess the word of God Amen man for you to speak the word of God Amen because that that goes to show whatever is in your heart what that if that has become a genuine reality in your heart amen that's going to come out of your mouth as well right I believe the Lord Jesus Christ I I I accept him as my Lord and Savior don't be embarrassed don't be shy don't uh don't don't I don't know amen just with Rejoice thank you Lord amen that why it's so important Amen to confess yes and let the let the whole world know is I like that that that song Amen I like a house on fire amen I've been touched by the fire so I'm going to let the whole world know amen that something has happened amen that I I have received a revelation down in my heart and it's not just in my head amen but down in my heart for with the heart man's man believeth unto righteousness and who is our righteousness Jesus Christ and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation amen amen so if tonight if there's nobody if you don't know Jesus Christ as your lord and savior if you haven't been born again amen tonight you can do so by confessing Lord Jesus Christ amen accept accepting him as your lord and savior amen if you want to pray if you want us to pray with you we'll be more than glad to pray with you if you're not sure if you are saved or born again we will we won't leave here tonight until you are sure amen until something has happened amen I don't if I don't care Wednesday night amen we'll be more than glad to do so because your soul is worth 10,000 worlds it's more important than Taco Bell and it's more important than your bed amen it's worth 10,000 worlds Amen brother amen and so that's what we want to do amen it's about salvation it's about the soul amen it's about the heart praise God Amen so salvation is not just about head knowledge and agreeing with it there are a lot of people people agree with the word amen but they haven't accepted it in their heart to put it into action am amen you must believe it from your heart so it can manifest outwardly Amen brother Bram says this I think of Samson he found a man with plenty of strength and Samson dedicated his strength to God but he wouldn't give his heart he gave that to Delilah see and and and I'm afraid that a uh a lot of our young people they do this in the stage when they're trying to look for husbands and wives cricket cricket they know that they shouldn't do that but yet they want to put him or her first before putting him first because they think that they can manipulate the situ ation or fix it up to where everything will come out all right if they do something about it but what did what did Jesus say he said a a he said seek ye first right that's right amen the boyfriend in your life and all these things shall be added unto you that's not what it says right seek ye first that beautiful girl in your life and all these other things shall be seek ye first that dream job in your life seek ye first that beautiful truck you've been wanting for a long time and all no seek ye first the kingdom amen who is the kingdom amen it's him amen and he is the holy spirit amen so seek ye first the holy ghost in your life first because the Holy Ghost amen will pinpoint you to that exact person that you should marry that's right amen that the Holy Ghost is like a radar right it's our GPS brother Wade has talked about and you put Lord Jesus I I want to I want to be able to I want to go I want to get married sometime go through the GPS and it tells you exactly where you need to go go here and it's always on the same screen it's always on the same spot amen it's always in the word where you find direction to where you need to be at and it pinpoints and the Holy Ghost amen will take you to a holy ghost filled person and and good things will happen then amen but when you put I ain't listening to that I've been this way before turning this thing off goodness you find yourself on the side of the road somewhere with some some man and some guy man who doesn't even know how to treat he treats his mom in the way that she should she should disrespects his mom lazy around the house still plays video games and he's he's 20 21 years old sitting plays video games and doesn't have a job but you say the Lord led me to him I don't know about that not not if you say you have the Holy Ghost the H the Holy Ghost doesn't lead you to something like that or vice versa right amen the Holy Ghost leads you Amen to more of something that you will grow further into him right so that is the reason why we have to seek first the kingdom of God Amen and his righteousness and then all those other things shall be added onto you amen so brother Ram says here God wants your heart your strength soul body mind all you got it's the only way he can use you use the whole man yes amen praise the Lord Jesus we'll stop it right there amen and and so um I know this was was more review we got into a little bit more but maybe we'll continue it next time I I I want to really look look at at at the life of those Pharisees but then I also want to get into a little bit more of what brother Brandon preached amen when he preached uh the uh the message of um what's the message the whole I forgot the title of the message now um it'll come come to me in just a moment where he talks about the Body Soul spirit and and all that um I think I have the title here somewhere now that's just going to bother me all night yeah amen so let's stand to our feet praise God Amen how many how many want amen God to just get a hold of your heart amen Lord get get a hold of me amen From the Inside Out amen I want to be the same amen I I I want to be different I want to be I want to be changed from the inside out and uh I I just don't want to be the same person amen amen praise God what a friend amen let's just bow our heads before we have brother Wade come Lord Jesus we just thank you Father once again for the opportunity that we have had to open up the the word Lord and I I pray Lord God that you would help us Lord Jesus to take these things to Heart Lord God and Lord help us father God in wherever we have failed you Lord in any of these areas Lord God direct us heavenly father to be better Lord God to to to see

me to announce the way brother randam did um certain things with ordination uh he's going to do the same thing he's going to do it individually okay so anybody that has a even has a position here at the church deacons trustees all right ministers we're going to do it all and we're going to just start all over and and let Brother Richard pray over each and every one of us individually and um and we'll have them you everybody come up here after the service he's going to preach whatever is on his heart for Sunday and then after that service we'll have ordination service like brother brandham did it and if you watch or or listen to the um sermons when he did the deacons in different on ordination he prayed over them and that's what we're going to do everyone that has a position our board of directors is not really a um um spiritual um I guess you might say it is but it but it's it's not something that brother brandom ordained in a church uh it's just deacons trustees and ministers all right and brother Richard asked today if I know all of you are going to be here but he wants to to pray over each and every one of us individually he really is happy to be able to come we sure missed Brother Richard we still um consider him he's just a like a second dad to to us and and uh appreciate his wisdom and U appreciate his stand for the gospel he's been he's been pastoring for you know 40 years too pretty close to it so U uh used to go here a long time ago and then they started their own work up in Tennessee and uh his boys will be here and and the most of the family will be here with us so just remember that Saturday at 3:00 bring you some food if you want to eat and fellowship if you want to go eat somewhere else and just come and fellowship that's fine but I thought we just do it here and that way we wouldn't have to go somebody's house we could just if you want to come that's fine if you don't that's okay I know some of you have different things to do on Saturdays but then Sunday we'll have a regular service on Sunday morning uh start at 9:45 and then we'll have the ministering and then after that ordination service and then after that uh we will have a uh a dinner
