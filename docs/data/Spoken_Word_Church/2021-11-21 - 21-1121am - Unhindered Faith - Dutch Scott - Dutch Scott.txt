========================================

uh [Music] amen amen praise the lord saying say man praise the lord amen it's good to be in church this morning amen amen good to see you all certainly good to see you all i'm just thinking how good it was to be in church or how good it is to be in church here this morning i thought but you know what's better than what's better really than being in church or at least it goes right there with it anyways and that's having the desire to be in church you know to actually have a desire to be in church to be with the saints to gather together that's right it just seemed like the further that we go that you know the fewer that have that real true all right one two three we're here right there we go okay hey man i'm just thinking yo but again it just seems like there's very few that have that real deep-seated desire to to be there every time those tor church doors are open and yeah i know the flesh is weak i hit the snooze button this morning and i ran a little bit late you know i was late i'm just just rushing right in here trying to get here and uh but the spirit is strong praise the lord the spirit is strong indeed and i'm happy to be with you guys this morning here amen i just want to again just thank brother dale for the invite and uh giving us this opportunity to be here i appreciate you brother i know i've said that about 10 times so far but i do i really do appreciate you and look up to you um we've been praying for you and sister dale amen and uh and all y'all amen all of you here and you know when your pastor is under attack it don't just affect him or or even just his family but it affects the whole body the whole the whole congregation and uh but it's just an amazing wonderful thing to see the body pull together like you have around him during this time and it really just shows that you love your pastor and you know i think god bless you for that amen so god bless you all god bless you all for that amen and again we're praying for all you and trust the lord he's just got great things many more years of great things at least until we get out of here it's time to go home amen praise the lord it's about going home time it really is i really believe that amen so i bring you guys uh greetings from the church home at plainville uh a big plainville howdy hello good to see you uh from there and also from brother david gadman uh who said to tell you hello also brother dale from brother homer is there and he's holding down the fort for us there while we're here and uh so we just really appreciate him for that too you know when brother wade called me brother wade called that's if i could come stand in for him while he was gone this weekend i told sister april i told my wife there i said you know i i can't turn him down i can't i can't say no as many times as he has come every time i've called and asked and you know we've just got just a small group there and i'm i'm the only minister and something comes up i'd call brother dale he's about my first go-to brother brother wade can you come down and almost without fail he has always just run right down and rescheduled things and done done things for me so of course i just had to say yes and amen so so we're solely you know and also i told brother brother sam this also but i said brother brother wade he's so special that he was actually the first minister that i i forgot to give an offering to one time and he he was so gracious that he actually came back after that and not to pick up the offer and i mailed that to him but he actually came back to to preach for me afterwards and i remembered i did remember to give him the to give him his offering there but that was quite embarrassing that was quite embarrassing anyways oh my i tell you what why are you standing won't you do this with me won't you turn with me to saint mark chapter 9 and then we're going to go back to daniel daniel chapter 10 and i was praying and wondering on what i should be speaking this morning what direction to take and trying to find the the leadership of the lord my you're fixing to find out real fast that i'm i'm not brother brother sam or brother wade and amen i'm i'm not what these other ministers here at all but by the grace of god i am what i am amen and um but i was praying and wondering what i should speak on what direction to take here what the will of the lord would be for you know the service here and i thought well what about what i preached last weekend you know i had such a wonderful time the preachers have a good time preaching too we want you guys to have a good time but we have a good time and i've always been of the mindset that if i can have a good time usually the people have a good time but if i have a terrible time man it's rough on you guys you know it's rough that way but uh but i preached on my theophany and again man oh man what a what a good time i had there the presence of the lord came down just channel after channel was open i was seeing scriptures connected i've never seen connect like that before and i just thought wow man that's that's awesome and then i thought um no there ain't no way i'm going to get up here and try to preach on my theophanies in front of brother dale there is no way that i'm going to do that in front of this brother here this brother is a legend when it comes to teaching and preaching the deep things in the message here so anyways i said no we ain't gonna do that went back to prayer and i think i found the leadership for the for the services today so we're just going to take a simple thought on faith this morning and just pray and i believe it is it'll be pleasing to the lord before we read our scriptures though here amen why don't we just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless his word one more time dear jesus we thank you lord we thank you dear god that we can be gathered together here lord with brothers and sisters brothers and sisters in christ those who have like precious faith dear god we're thankful lord that we can come together under the banner of a of a message in this last day a message dear god that has told us who we are and lord not just who you are lord but who we are and to know lord jesus that we're a part of you amen to know dear god what our heritage is lord and the inheritance that you've given us dear god we thank you from the bottoms of our heart lord we thank you we just asked lord as we stand here before this open word dear god that you would come and you would break it open supernaturally to our souls to our hearts lord may you just encourage us here this morning dear god i just feel like it's such a simple thought perhaps lord but the lord jesus one that could encourage us and help us along the way and if we could just have one lord that was helped along the way today there then then dear god it would it would be worth it it'd be worth everything we've done and every effort that we've put forth lord god we love you and we love your saints just ask now your blessings upon these words i'm about to read i pray in jesus name amen amen so mark chapter 9 verse 23 here amen and jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen all things are possible turn back with me to daniel chapter 10 as well amen one verse from here too i don't want to keep you standing too long here but daniel chapter 10 verse 1 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing i like that a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belt chazar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision amen god bless you may be seated here this morning amen you know just like i said i want to speak on faith just a little bit if i could here this morning and uh you know i believe that that should be really just about the most basic cry of a true believer of a christian the longer we go and the further we go into you know these last days i think that really should be just a basic basic cry of the believer here should be just lord give me more faith i need more faith right i need more faith and not not faith as as the nominal churches of today would would define faith and you know people in the world how they would look at faith they talk about the faith for this or the faith for that but when you really get down to it and you begin talking to folks you see that most people have an idea when they talk about faith it's more of a hocus pocus or a rub the bottle and the genie comes out you know and maybe you'll click your ruby slippers together three times and wish upon a star and maybe somehow some way that god will deem to come down and actually grant your prayer you know and uh but true faith is not like that i'm so thankful we have a message that that explains and reveals what faith is and true faith is a it's a revelation which has been revealed to you something that has been revealed to you by by god himself something that's been revealed way down in your heart and you can't let it go amen we look back at the characters and the the the heroes from the the scriptures and what we find is that these men and these women they were they were moved by something you know there was something that would get a hold of them there was a thing as daniel said a thing was revealed to them and they couldn't get a real away from the thing so what you found out was it was not so much that they were holding the faith but the faith was holding them right and there's a big difference between those two things because i'm weak as i said this flesh is weak but if god's holding on to me this morning it's okay it's okay right well god bless you brother louis amen brother dale said you were gone amen it's good to see you this morning amen but so faith is a it's a very real thing brother branham made this this ever so familiar statement in the church age book one time and what he said there was that we ought to pray for the paraphrasing here forgive me but we ought to pray for revelation more than anything else more than anything else we ought to be praying for revelation he said well i need healing in my body amen i'm praying for healing no you need to be praying for the revelation that he is your healer right you say well i'm i'm lost i've got sin in my life i've got this i need to pray for a saving for a savior whatever you need to pray for the revelation that jesus christ died for your sins amen shed his blood for you right you need to pray for a revelation everything comes by revelation everything comes by faith it's all faith faith is a revelation and revelation is faith so yes we we pray for more faith lord give me more faith so with that said we're i want to talk this morning really i guess if i could title this i i'm tired faith has no hindrances faith has no hindrances here amen i'm going to take that from a quote a very familiar quote here and brother branham said this in the message 1963 perseverance it's okay to read quotes hearing it amen so all right we good perseverance he said now she had many hindrances this little woman now she had a daughter that was having epilepsy and and she was very very bad and and she'd heard that jesus healed epilepsy now faith cometh by hearing are you hearing something saying are you hearing a thing this morning right faith cometh by hearing he said now she she'd heard that jesus healed epilepsy faith cometh by hearing and and that was her child so she was determined to get down somewhere and hear jesus and now she had many hindrances just many many hindrances but her faith didn't have no hindrance tonight people has lots of hindrances right he said your mind has lots of hindrances but your faith there's nothing can stand in its way because faith has or faith knows no hindrances praise the lord amen now now this little woman here i can relate to her very well i can relate to her because i can look in my life i can see my flesh and the things that i go through and i can see many many things that stand in the way sure you can too right we're human we all have the same human experience and she had he said here he said she has many many many many hindrances she had here but not her faith her faith was unhindered man that's awesome that's awesome right there to know i can be hindered in many different ways in this thing right here but when that revelation strikes my heart it has no hindrances whatsoever praise the lord praise the lord did you hear it faith cometh by hearing right right so this little woman she she heard it and she she heard the truth and that's what he said here she she had heard that jesus healed epilepsy man what an awesome thing to hear years ago i i knew a brother that his wife was sick she had a very serious disease she she actually she passed away from it later on but she god called her home and put it that way she was she's a christian so god took her home that was just a vehicle that he used to to do it with see but but still she so he he came and one day we were talking he said man he said if i could just he was searching the message and he was trying to you find people reaching out to people all over the world trying to find an example of maybe where where they had been healed from this certain disease this this certain disease it was a terrible disease and he was trying to find somebody that he could look at and say god was able to heal that disease and i know that if he healed that one that one right there then he'll heal my wife too and and i and and for some reason he was trying to anchor in that and i said but but brother you got to understand that if god healed a toothache he can heal that right if god healed a you know a an aching back he can heal that if god can heal a stumped toe he can heal that it's not one thing greater or worse or or whatever it it might seem that way and that in front of him was a hindrance it was a great hindrance because he never could find anybody that god had had reached out and healed from from this disease i'm not saying there was never you know there has never been anybody that god would heal from this certain disease god heals everything and truth be told she got the greatest healing she could ever have when she crossed over that over the way right praise the lord we thank god for that for faith there but he said here again now she she heard she'd heard that that jesus healed hillary uh epilepsy now but now even with the hearing because we all go through these things we've we've heard we've heard the message and we we've heard your messages on faith we've heard the deep mysteries of god we've heard all these things like that but even in that yet in our in our flesh and our bodies we still have a lot of hindrances right we still got a lot of things that we go through and and this little woman did here i'm not going to preach the whole time on her but it's just so good when you look at you know what she come through here but the one the woman that he's talking about here is the woman in and she's in in saint matthew chapter 15 here and and and and she had her daughter had epilepsy or the bible said that she her daughter was sick here let me let me just read it right quick this is matthew chapter 15 and maybe i can get settled down on this but matthew chapter 15 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou said of david my daughter is grievously fixed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us you see she wasn't going to be dissuaded right she just kept on knocking just kept on knocking right she just kept on knocking send her away for she cries after us but he answered and he said i'm i am not sent unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then she came and she worshipped him saying lord help me think about that he ignores her he says i'm not sent but to the lost sheep of israel i'm not even sent to your people she's a canaanite i'm not even sent to your people and then she comes and worships him and she says lord help me she's still got her need she's still got her hindrances and in fact jesus brother branham goes on to say in one place that this was actually one of the hindrances she has at the same place of perseverance this is actually one of the the hindrances she has was that she was being ignored by jesus oh my goodness can you imagine i mean you go to the lord you cry out to the lord he said he always hears me he's there you know he hears my cries he answers my prayers he does all these things but he she actually she actually was ignored by jesus right that'd be a pretty big hindrance wouldn't it and so she goes worships says lord help me but he answers now he speaks directly to her he's not just talking to the disciples but he speaks directly to her and he said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs so now not only is he ignoring her not only is he saying you know you are of the wrong race but now he is calling her a dog man that's rough in the climate we have in this country today man we you'd get killed you said something like that you know but i mean she's she's i mean you look at the hindrances she has the things that she's going through the things it's been and just the the god himself is calling her a dog she said truth lord she didn't get mad she didn't get upset she didn't get her feelings hurt she didn't get offended and she made a choice and i would say that's that's a big part of our lives we have to make a choice you can choose to be offended blessed is he that's not offended in me you can choose to be offended over something and get your nose stuck in the air and everything else and and but you you will not be blessed that way you'll not get what you asked for that way you'll never you'll never come to to whatever it is that you're seeking it in that way it won't work amen but this this woman says truth lord man it's pretty awesome it's pretty awesome truth lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour praise the lord amen praise the lord that's a faith builder right there right right great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and then again you look this is this is a canaanite woman god is dealing with the jews so there it's not even their time he's not dealing with the gentiles at this time here jesus jesus had ignored her jesus had turned and said it's not for you jesus had turned and called her a dog and all these things but yet he still at her faith at the the anchor of her faith he still answered her cry he didn't have to but he did it because she had faith all she had to do was ask and believe and believe that he could and that he would do it and her daughter was more was more important to her than her pride her her need was more to her than than than the pride of what this would say or what that one would say or my national pride or whatever it might be it was more than that she had a need that was great i think that's a problem today is that most people don't realize they have such a great need of a great savior they don't have such a they don't have a sense of a need everybody is you know they don't know how to come down and say my need is greater than my pride my need is greater than my hurt my need is greater than than whatever it is and they'll hold on to these human emotions and those things become a hindrance to them those things become a hindrance to them but if you could ever just let that faith go down below that and get to that spot where you could say truth lord truth lord right god will move right i forget who it was but i heard a brother make a statement a few years ago he's talking about jesus and the the madman of of i can never pronounce the land there gudera or gurgas gerges knees or something like that you should see me trying to pronounce hebrew words it's not funny but he made him the the brother that was i heard and again i can't i'm trying my best to remember who it was and i can't remember who it was but he made the statement there that that jesus jesus even granted the legion of devil's request i mean if there's anybody that jesus would say man i ain't listening to you you would think you'd be a legion of devils right if there's anybody that god would say no nick say i am not going to answer your prayers that is not going to happen you would think it'd be a legion of devils amongst whom brother branham said there was a there was an alcoholic spirit there was lion spirits there were cheating spirits there was all these things so the man showed up one time and he began just one thing after another he told a lie and then he had to grow and do this one and that one and the devils just kept on one by one as he went through that that sorry life kept just one by one piling on and his whole life fell apart and his family fell apart and his friends ran off from him in the attitudes that he had and everything else because he was just piling these devils on himself and he finally found himself in a graveyard cutting and beating himself and screaming and hollering and full of anger and and all these things and it was nothing but a legion of devils on this man that he had allowed to come in but there was something on the inside of this man that was more than that legion of devils there was something in this this down on the inside of this man that cried out and jesus could hear him plum across the sea so there's somebody crying out and he went all the way across the sea to go to this one man because as soon as that was over what'd he do he got back in the boat and he went back to the other side man again that's pretty awesome that might be my favorite word today that's pretty awesome amen and he would go all the way over there for this one man but when the legion of demons when they when he cast these demons out they they they begged and they said don't don't throw us into the abyss don't don't throw us out there into the darkness into the void don't throw us there and you gotta think demons have motives too and jesus they said let the demons say let us go under this heart of swine and jesus says okay go again he actually granted them their wish if he would regret the wishes of a legion of devils how much more would he grant the the desire of a of a son or a daughter of god has been washing the blood of jesus how much more this morning would he say amen so be it by faith by revelation someone had the right motives and those demons promptly turned around and ran that herd of swine right off into the right off into the ocean you know why he ran them off into the ocean while they ran them off in the ocean it's because the spirits didn't doubt the pigs died but the spirit brother brandon made the statement he said god will take his man but he won't take the spirit and he said and the devil would take his take his man but he will leave the spirits behind and they'll go on and get on somebody else and that herd of swine went off and died amen but those spirits were free to go somewhere else lying didn't stop when that when those pigs ran off that how that cliff did it but jesus granted it oh my glory to god i only believe all things are possible just believe the thing the thing have faith catch that revelation amen faith is faith is unhindered right has no hindrances right she had many hindrances but her faith did not have any hindrances you know maybe we could say we see here this morning we can look back perhaps in the you know we look back at just our you know yesterday or the last week we might have had a rough time and went through this maybe a down time or whatever it was could have been the last you know 30 minutes or just right before you pulled up in church i remember brother barry coffey making this statement one year at the men's meeting and he talked about this families i always just admire this family and they would come up and and you know this this wife and husband and their kids and they'd come up in their car and every every sunday before they got out of the car they would all bow their heads and they would just pray so sincerely and then they'd get out and they'd go to church he said one day i went to the brother and i told the brother he said man i just want you to know that you are a testimony you are a witness you are such an encouragement to me when i see you come in and pray for your faith your whole family just praying like that before you go into church and you're praying for the services and the brother looked at him kind of you know a gas he looked at him kind of just incredulous and he said brother he said we're not necessarily praying for the service he said we're repenting he said because we've been fighting and fussing the whole way to church and running late and this and that we're repenting before we go in because we don't want the lightning bolts to reign out of heaven and get us right perhaps we all can relate to that in one way or the other because again we're human we share this same journey amen if there's one in here that can say they're perfect then you need to get up here because it ain't me the curtains at the hotel worked really what best curtains i have ever seen in the hotel you know they always leave that one gap where that light can it always comes in and gets you right that curtain this morning i got up early was studying my wife was sleeping she pulled the pillow over her head and she's sleeping in there and i'm just working away you know pecking away at my computer and and and and putting things in and this and out and just re-changing things in mind and and then i look at my watch and it said eight o'clock and i said what it's dark that was the best curtains i ever saw you know told my wife went woke her up real easy you need to get up honey it's eight o'clock what why didn't you wake me up earlier i said i didn't know it was that late and then it's long praise saints pray right pray saints pray maybe we could say you know i know i know the prophet i know the prophet said that faith has no hindrances but man oh man i surely do i have a lot of hindrances you know people has a lot of entrances my mind has a lot of hindrances whether it be work and busy and this and that and everything else my body has a lot of hindrances our lives have a lot a lot of hindrances that stay in the way that stand in the way of the promises it seems like right but your faith you got to realize that your faith is not it's not this thing right here it's not tied to this thing right here it's not even tied to the five senses that we have in our bodies those five things that god give us to and i'm not going to try to try to remember them all because i never do i always leave them out and get them in the wrong order but those five things that god give us to to contact our earthly home with your faith is not even tied to that your faith is in a place it's down in a realm it's down inside that heart of hearts it's down inside that soul and he said it's not even touched by what you can feel out here he said it has no he said only there's only one or one or another thing that can that can influence that faith he said that's either faith or doubt that's that place in their heart it's either faith or doubt that's it there's nothing else to come into play but we put so much in this thing right here and how we how we feel i just don't feel like it or maybe i did feel like it or whatever it might be you know like that in all the different range and spectrum in between we can have all these areas here we can say but maybe he said that faith has no hindrances but i sure do i have all these things and then we get there and we listen that devil and that devil comes and tells you he says well you know what you shouldn't even pray you don't even need to be praying right now look at what you did or look at what you felt or look at what you thought and all these different things which he's a liar anyways he can't hear your thoughts but he'll tell you he can and he'll bring a wave he'll bring a wave of guilt he'll do something on there that will come down and we'll get to that spot remember it's either faith or doubt down on the inside and if he can influence you through what you feel and how you're acting if he can influence you in such a way to stop that faith from really sinking in right that's all he's trying to do he's playing the game brother branham said he's a bluff say boo devil back and put out a prayer request you know once or twice a week every how many times the things come in we'll put out the prayer requests and everything else and that's a favorite thing of mine just say boo devil back because you know it looks like they're huge devils the blue devil back be a lot of hindrances but my faith has no hindrances faith knows no hindrances so faith didn't you know faith knew no hindrances as brother branham would say here in this this little mother back there 2 000 years ago it did not know hindrances in brother branham's day 50 60 70 years ago now we've come a long ways ain't we i remember when i come into the message it's only been 33 years ago when i come into the message and man i thought it was on then i mean we're going home brother dale i mean i remember i remember you from 30 years ago we were going home wasn't we we were going home here i stand 33 years later a little bit more stooped a lot more gray hair and my skin looks a little bit more like paper than it used to do yeah and all these things and i think man now the brother brown that was 50 60 70 years ago and all the things that have hindrances we could say many hindrances brother branham faced many hindrances what about when sister hope and little sharon rhodes got sick and and passed over that's a great hindrance now we're coming through the well i guess you could call it the days of covid we've had many hindrances many have passed on friends and family loved ones brothers and sisters in christ when he's there and little sharon rose is suffering such and she's about to go and he's praying and he said the heavens became his brass that'd be a major hindrance wouldn't it when he got a need such as that but the heavens become his brass he said god closed the curtain and wouldn't even hear and pray and that devil began speaking began getting up there and speaking in that ear and began to tell him he said after all those ones that you prayed for he said he didn't tell me that god wasn't a healer he said he couldn't say that because i knew better than that he said he had faith with it he knew he knew that he said he couldn't tell me that that god wasn't a healer because i'd seen too many things but what he could do he could get up there and start twisting like he does and he began to talk to him and said he said oh after all those ones that you have prayed for and god has healed but he won't heal your little sharon rose and there's your wife laying there in the morgue god didn't hear you god will not hear you and he said you know what he said i said you're right devil and if god was such a good god and this and that and everything else he said you know the thing if it was the hard part was is that the devil was literally telling him the truth can you imagine a rotten devil telling the truth that's just sickening and perverted in itself and yet here's this devil he's telling the truth and he he said he said i was just about right about ready so i was almost i was fixing to say you say he had hindrances he's trying to pray for something but you know you would have to say it was god's will to take her home and he said i was fixing to say i'm through i'm done if that's the way you're going to treat me i'm done many hindrances right but faith has no hindrances and down on the inside he said before i could say it there was something began to move down on the inside there was something down on the inside in here that began to came up and said and without even him he said i didn't even really think he's just boiled up from the inside and comes out and says you know the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah there was a faith that was moving right it was beyond him it was not him it was beyond him there was something that was there and i think too many times we still we try to go to this thing right here and our feelings our thoughts our understandings and we try to to bring up a faith the level of faith that can withstand the devil in this hour and we're doing it right here but this thing has many hindrances it's right here where the faith has to come up from there has to be a genuine revelation not just a revelation don't get me wrong this might sound wrong here but bear with me a second not just a revelation that there's a such thing called a serpent seed and not just a revelation that there's a certain there's certain group called the predestinated and not just a certain revelation of water baptism in the name of of the lord jesus christ and not the trinity and everything else not just all the different things of doctrines that we can check off that we're so happy about from this message but you've got to have something that goes beyond that down the inside that says not only is he god but i'm his child i am that predestinated amen i am that blood washed saint i am that one he's talking about and if there's one from george georgia that's going right right i'm not gonna be exclusive with me only i say we're all gonna go how about that praise the lord amen i want us all to go as one body how about that there's one going it's the body of jesus christ that's who's going from georgia right praise the lord [Applause] i had a brother one time that was they called me and he didn't have a pastor he wouldn't sit under a pastor a lot of the problem wasn't it but he uh he made a statement he said he said brother branham said there's three kind of believers in every congregation i said yes he said that he said have you identified yours yet i said mercy man what are you talking about he said well you should be able to identify the three kind of believers in your church he said there's three kind of believers that are there and i said listen brother i know what he said and i believe what he said i said but you know if i can't look at my everyone that's sitting in that congregation and say you are my brother and you are my brother and you are my sister and we're all going together i said something's wrong i can't preach to you the way i'm supposed to preach to you that's right i'll just let god figure out the rest of it right i want us all to be there amen i want us all to be together right amen praise the lord there's something about that faith though there's something about the faith on the inside there's something about that oh my that that regardless of the circumstances and regardless of the feelings and all the different things that you're going through as grim and as hard as they are still this faith holds still this faith holds and i just want to say this morning that that faith is still unhindered it was unhindered in jesus's day it was unhindered in brother branham's day and it's unhindered in our day also brothers and sisters it is just as unhindered now as it ever was only believe all things are possible they're still possible amen praise the lord last week we were praying for a sister she's actually in kentucky it's the sister of our the mother of our song leader sister rhonda goat and and she she she called or sent out a prayer request through her son said pray for us said that and there's many praying for not just us as many people around the around the country praying i'm sure but she said she went to the doctor she had coven a few months ago and it was a really bad case i mean she was having a hard hard time it took her a long time to get over she's a nurse took her a long time to get over she finally gets over it and now she started having heart problems and and they went and they began doing tests and they found that she had a leaking valve and the covet had hit her heart and she had a leaking valve and because of that leaking valve and something else that was going on they said that their her her organs were not getting enough oxygen so the heart was not not moving the oxygenated blood into her organs like it was supposed to do it's a very serious thing they said we're going to have to do surgery and fix that valve and we'll probably have to treat the rest with medication you really don't there's not much we can do for it and then the saints prayed and then the saints prayed a few days later we got word back she went back to the doctor and the doctor said man it turned 180 so you don't need surgery you don't need medicine right praise the lord praise the lord all things are still still possible i stand up here my legs feel like they're about to give out my eyes are about to close up and everything's just shaking and and just brother dale knows some of the things that you've been through and we still stand here and we still tell you that all things are still possible it don't matter whether it happens today whether it happens tomorrow or whether it happens 25 years from now it does not happen does not matter because faith is unhindered faith is unhindered only believe saints only believe and these days there are so many troubles so many sicknesses so many loved ones and brothers and sisters in the lord that have gone on and different ones and and we look at our life and our day-to-day life and all that we go through and all that we have to face as we go through our days here below and just seems like there's so many insurmountable obstacles challenges that are just way beyond us i mean way behind us right when you're young you think that you've got the bull by the horns man you can do it you can you can steer it where you want to steer it and you don't feel the aches and the pains and the different things but there's just so many there's older you get you find out there's so much that you can't do right there's just so many uncertainties that we have no power over right brother dale would you have thought you know the first year going into the first year that you would be you know where you are right now that you had to go through the the stroke and all these things you never would think that but we have we have no power over things in our flesh we have no power and i think that's one of the i think that's one of the the hardest things for me to get my mind around and really to get a grasp on maybe it's because i'm still young enough that i that i still want to do that you know i still want to be able to control things i still want to but i have no power to change any of it not in this flesh man i don't but you see the thing is but then my anchor kicks in but then my anchor kicks in and it gives me a great big check you know to chunk that dog can run out there ever so far but after a while there's the end he hits the end of that chain and chunk it was flip plumb back around i trained bird dogs for a while and in my they would run out there and you put them on a you put them on a a training rope a check rope and they would run out there and you wanted to run out so far but when you said whoa you wanted them to whoa they they couldn't there was no halting they had to stop right on the dime and the way you do that you take that rope and you let them hit it a couple times until they learn after a while they would be listening they may be running 90 miles an hour but they had that ear in the wind and as soon as you said whoa they put the brakes on right because they knew that's what that anchor on the inside the believer is it's a check down inside there amen this flesh will carry you ever so far it can go through ever so many hindrances it can go through ever so many things and you can say oh woe is me and this hurts and that hurts and i'm sick and i don't feel good and i don't know if this is ever going to end but after a while there's something on the inside that says check and you say i'm a son of god hallelujah god's heal me i don't care if i feel it now he has already healed me he has already done the work it's a finished work right praise the lord in this flesh we are nothing in this flesh we are weak in this flesh we have no power but in the spirit i am a son of the most high god and every devil of hell is subject to me to quote brother david gadman amen if you know brother david you know what i'm talking about that's a great big so be it is what that is right i love brother david amen if ever there's a time to only believe now now is the time to do that just only believe amen everything else is falling apart you might as well try belief right faith this is it saints so in light of all the battles that we face and weary as we are many times through all the ups and downs of life and the struggles and all these things i ask you this has our faith grown weaker that's the part where you say no no no sir no way no how my faith is just as strong now as it's ever been that's what your prophet said he said faith has no hindrances faith knows no hindrances right faith today is just as strong as it was 70 years ago listen it wasn't brother branham's faith it was the faith of the lord working through brother branham and it's not your faith it's the faith the sovereign gift of god is god's faith working through his bride to bring his word to pass to bring his word to manifestation in some he has to bring it through a sickness in their body to show healing amen in other words he brings a sickness in the body to show a a endurance or something he's got many different purposes in his way but all these things he gives you faith to go through this to manifest his word it is a gift of god and your faith is unhindered because if you can hinder your faith you can hinder god i look that word up unhindered are you okay for a few more minutes amen i looked that word up that word unhindered oh man it's an awesome word it's a wonderfully positive word here i think we need some positivity from time to time amen unhindered is defined as unobstructed our faith is unobstructed faith has no obstructions in its way right that's pretty awesome right unhindered unobstructed now again now i'm not trying to be your spiritual cheerleader here this morning that's not what i'm trying to do you can take it or leave it it's totally up to you but i just wanted to put the devil on notice this morning and say i believe in my faith that there is no obstructions that you can throw in my way that's going to stop that faith we see that's how you have to do it right you've got to recognize what's faith in you what's faith and or what's just your mental makeup what you're thinking your intellectual understanding of it or whatever you've got to be able to get down to a point you say listen there's an anchor down there i just can't move past when the when the all the the signed stuff believe the sign junk started going through and turning and doing all the things and people started leaving right and left we lost some and all the different things and the arguments that bring up and this and that and just so much and man i'll just tell you as a pastor i thought it was my duty to go in and really just research this stuff out and just look at what they were saying i had to i was going to find an answer and i did find an answer to a lot of it but i'll be honest with you there was a lot of stuff there for days it was hard and it would rock you to your core and i would tell you within a i mean just without a hesitation don't do it don't go there don't even pay it no mine and after going through that stuff for months and months and months and pouring through that stuff i come to this conclusion that no matter how much how many rebuttals i can make and how much intellectually i could come back and say yeah but this and you changed that and they did they changed a lot of words to make it say that they say brother and make him say something that he didn't say and then they would take him out of context or then they would take some maybe he did say that here but you've got to understand he's a man that's sitting there in a natural natural reality seeing something and explaining what he's saying naturally but yet supernatural is going on how in the world do you do that there's all sorts of things but one thing i came to is this it don't matter how well i can intellectually understand it or explain it or or or give a rebuttal to the to the arguments or whatever it might be it didn't matter because it wasn't going to touch that because we wasn't really i should i was trying to get to a place of faith and you can't do that through intellectualism you can't do it i saw a debate between a an atheist a well-known very famous atheist um hitchens i don't know if any of you ever heard of hitchens but hitchens and and a doctor of theology and and this man he said right from the start it was a two-hour debate it was really interesting i like watching stuff like that and and it was really interesting but the the the the christians sat there and he said all right right from the start the first question he said i want to ask you something he said if i could if i could could explain this in such a way if i could prove to you beyond a shadow of a doubt if i could bring you proof that god exists and that jesus is his name and for a lot of people that's two different things that god exists and jesus is his name will you become a christian and the the atheist kitchen screamed out of meeting no i mean just just like that spittle flying i mean no just just just you i mean it's just crazy to see his face and turk looks at him and he says or looks at the camera and looks at the moderator he says see that's the problem the problem is not right here the problem is right here because we understand a lot of things right here but you got to believe from your heart and it don't matter how much proof you can show this right here if that right there ain't right it ain't going to work and i could go to believe the sign and i could show them a lot of things right here i could explain a lot of things and i have right here and everything else and it does not change a thing and i have talked to to saints to people afterwards that having problems with this and that because of that and i can go and i can explain it with this right here but it does not change a thing and what i've come to find out is like herding cats people are going to do what people are going to do they're going to do what they want to do every time and it's a thing that's in their heart is what it is but aren't you so thankful for an unobstructed faith that when all these things come up and all the you can still sit there and you can say you know what but i still believe i don't care what you tell me i still believe i don't care what you say about about the prophet i still believe that god sent this prophet i still believe this this message is the revelation for an end time bride i still believe every bit of this amen hallelujah because there's an anchor on the inside there's something that raises up right there and said this is true no matter there is no obstruction to it it is unhindered there are no obstacles in its way he can throw obstacles before our eyes he can throw obstacles to our mind he can do all these things to our natural understanding the natural part can be hindered but you see for the bride she goes beyond the natural to the supernatural faith is not hindered unhindered means to not be restrained it's not to be restrained or held back it's unobstructed not restrained it's not healed back that's your faith you know i just finished reading through the the book of john again and and in there there are a few times when the pharisees and the sadducees would surround jesus and the scribes they would surround jesus with ill intent in their heart they would have stones in their hands about ready to to stone him right that's putting it mildly but but but the scripture says that jesus would just pass right through their midst i always liked that he just passed right through or or they would say he escaped out of their hands he just slid right out of their hands right and it wouldn't affect him he'd go right to the next place and he'd keep right on preaching he'd keep right on doing this all the miracles and the signs and the wonders and all the different things what's the bottom line the bottom line was they could not restrain him they couldn't hold him back they couldn't stop the word they couldn't stop the message it was going forth they could not stop that why because you see he was the revelation of the invisible god made visible in flesh and blood right he knew his time was not yet that's why paul could stand up on a ship that was about to be torn to pieces and say listen if you'll stay with me there'll be no lie no loss of life why could he say that he could say that because he had a revelation he had a word of god directly from the angel himself that told him you're going to go stand before caesar right he had that so what's a little what's a little shipwreck here and there what's a few animals tearing you at the flesh here and there what's what's the 30 or 40 lashes save one here and there what are all these things it don't matter what they do to me it don't matter what happens because god said i'm going to be over there and if he said i'm going to go see caesar guess what i'm going to go see caesar and if god said i'm going to make it through in this day guess what i'm going to make it through if god said i'm going to take a body change and i'm going to go on a rapture praise the lord i'm going to take a body change and i'm going to go on the rapture i don't have to know what's happening in between i've just got to go to that faith on the inside and say it's going to be because god said so my faith is unhindered now there's lots of things that happen in between things that really get us going things that we said man i had no clue i had no clue that would have ever happened in my life this is not where i thought i was going to be what's it matter what i think i'm going to be or where i think i'm going to be it's where i know i'm going to be and i know i'm going to be there with him amen you see the devil cannot restrain that he cannot restrain that that revelation is unhindered by the ill intents of those that are around them amen you read over into the book of acts and you find the disciples there and they're locked up put in jail i mean they're in jail right they are put in jail a lot worse than our jails sounds like a hindrance to me but not to god because god had a word of revelation that had to be preached and their faith could not be hindered their revelation could not be hindered so the angel lord just went down there picked them up and you know took them out of the jail cell where they were and they were found the next morning in the temple preaching the name of jesus christ right the high priest called for them and said loose them out of the jail cell and bring them to me how do you lose something that was unbound to begin with our faith our true faith knows no bounds it's not bound it's not it's not restricted it's not restrained it is unhindered all we have to do is just abide in jesus he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you the high priest said bring them up here they went down they looked they came they said there's bars there and there's jails there and there's there's guards there there's weapons there but there ain't no disciples there they ain't there they're up in the temple preaching and proclaiming the name of jesus unhindered also means listen this part here unhindered also means without anyone or anything making it difficult to do something or force something to happen it's not slowed or blocked or interfered with so all things are not only possible but they're actually easy with faith now boy don't that just fly in your face don't that just fly in your face it's easy with faith it's easy if this is easy why do you struggle so much dutch right because you see i've got many many hindrances but my faith has none jesus walked down along the way one day and he wasn't hungry and in his body he was tired weary and hungry now i don't know if jesus got hangry sorry for that but you know when i get that way when my wife should say that when i get that way if i get hungry and tired and weary like that i get hangry you know there's a little bit of anger a little bit of hunger and they mix together and it's hangry feed me and i'm just like yo everything's just fine then you know but jesus is tired weary and hungry and he's walking along the way and and there's a fig tree and he he sees a fig tree by the way and he said hey that's gonna fix it that's that's gonna i'll feel better i just need to get some food in my body you know so he he walks over to the tree and huh there's no figs on that tree and he curses it and just walks on right he just he curses the tree and he just walks on the disciples i can just imagine the disciples you know they're following you you know they would follow right in his footsteps right just like we're supposed to do so if jesus is walking along in a straight line can i get down for a second so if jesus is walking down in a straight line there right behind him in a straight line perhaps maybe i don't know how it would go but then he'd see a tree and he said hey let's go look at the tree this fig tree so i'm sure they just stayed diverted and they went right over there they began falling what is he doing they go over there and they see him look at that fig tree and then he curses the fig tree and then he walks on and the disciple says they're following him you know right by that fig tree they look and they say huh it's a fig tree with no figs nothing's happened what's going to happen nothing happens and they walk by one by one and all of them look at that tree and they walk down the road i can imagine they're walking down the road they're still looking to that tree what's happening he cursed the fig tree i want to see what's going to happen to the fig tree jesus spoke something's got to happen right right but nothing happened and jesus didn't make no big deal of it he just walked on i'm sure that i'm sure that it was just something that he didn't even think about again right in fact i know it was because the prophet i didn't bring the quote forgive me but i know it was because the prophet said that jesus had an unconscious faith he didn't even have to think about it now again before you say that's jesus or that's brother branham you remember brother branham going into the into the field and there's the bulls and bulls chasing and everything else but brother brahm said love overcame he said it wasn't me it was love projected out to the bull right when love projects and the bees the hornets come out and all these things we say oh that was brother branham can i tell it my wife sitting here saying whoops you as a preacher one thing you don't do is you don't start telling stories about your wife when you're preaching but i'm going to tell you one anyways so she was so she she had this this wasps nest when i came in one day from work and there's a watson that's building on her porch and i said i need to get rid of that wasp-ness and she said no no no me and those wasps have a deal i'm not going to bother them and they're not going to bother me you know i'm going to love them they're going to be okay that's fine in the springtime in the summertime but as you get closer to the end of the summer time i don't know if you've noticed or not but wasps and yellowjackets and stuff like that they get a little angry too they get they get kind of agitated and i came home one day and that waspness was gone and she said you know what that wasp broke his deal it stung her and she got rid of the wasps amen but jesus when he walks alone it's just an unconscious faith he didn't have to think about it he didn't have to try to love him he didn't have to try to do this or anything else it was just it was unhindered there was it was just easy there was no there was no obstructions there was nothing like that it was unconscious to him brother branham said i found that very amazing when the prophet made that statement that he it was an unconscious faith i thought how in the world is an unconscious faith because when i go to praying for something like that i'm consciously thinking okay lord he's going to do this god is going to do this the word says this and god's going to do this and this is the way it's going to be and you know what sometimes it's not and then i get all down and into molly grubs and everything else because it's not and i think what in the world happened you see it's because i have hindrances and i wasn't pulling down to true faith i was sitting right here trying to have an intellectual knowledge of what it should be and when it didn't happen the devil could come sit there and say see i told you so but how many times is it when you pray for something and you just turn it over to the lord amen and you just go on walking and after a while you'll just kind of look around one day and it's just there you know it's just something you say man i didn't even see that in coming you say thank you lord you see it's because your faith is unhindered and god's going to do things in his own time he does things in his own time can you imagine what it must have been when the disciples come back the next day and they walk back by and jesus don't he's not even thinking about that fig tree anymore he just goes right on walking and perhaps right down the path through there and perhaps the disciples they know they are thinking and they're coming up and they're thinking maybe just me just dramatizing a little bit but i can just imagine because i know what i'd be doing right and as they're coming along that trail they say you know what just over that hill over there there's a fig tree that jesus cursed yesterday let's go see what happened and as jesus walks down the path maybe they just kind of took a quick detour to go up there and look at that fig tree to see what and they were amazed because it was it was dead it had withered from the roots up right it had withered from the roots up oh praise the lord you just speak the word and let god take care of it he'll hit it at the roots and it'll work his way up hallelujah you don't have to see it you don't have to think about it you don't have to worry about it amen he struck it at the roots and it's got to be just what he said hallelujah praise the lord oh perhaps we don't see anything we don't see it with our natural eyes but we ain't looking with our natural eyes anyways we ain't supposed to be looking with our natural eyes anyways brother aaron we're not supposed to be looking at it and saying oh you know this is the way it's got to be that's the problem but we're supposed to be looking with our eagle eyes with the eyes of our theophany brother branham said oh i better stop brother branham said he said theophany is only like in his day he said that theophany is only it's like 20 feet away in another dimension moving faster than we are right that's what he said he said but oh my one day we're going to meet but he said when in another he said when you hear he said when you recognize that the word of god is eagle food you have heard from your theophany oh praise god hallelujah we have been feeding upon this word and feeding upon this word we have been feeding upon this word for 40 50 60 years some of us 33 years on this word and i tell you this we're closer today to that theophany that we ever have i don't think we're near so far away from that theophany now as we were when we started i don't think that we i don't think that not sometimes we're not even 20 feet away it's right here just in another dimension moving faster and when you can come up to the word of god and the word of god says something and you believe it that faith kicks him you're not looking with these natural eyes you're looking with those eyes of the theophany you're looking through that word body the word says this and that word what is it the word is in the presence of the lord he's in the presence of god it's in the presence of that shekinah glory there's times when we can feel that right that portal is open that wind is open we begin to feel that what is it you're seeing through the eyes of your theophany you're hearing through the eyes of your theophany you're feeling through the body your ethophany amen that theophany is right there hallelujah we sit there we're there just up under the altar our theophany who are you anyways you say you are yeah you are sitting there because you are the word you are the word who are you little bride you're that word you're that word that he saw before the foundation of the world you're that word when he said let us make man in our own image that's you little bride that's you and where is that theophany brother dale he said it's in that sixth dimension right it's in that sixth dimension i said i wasn't going to do this i said i wasn't going to do this okay brother dale can correct me if i get something off here later on i take correction very good i say yes sir that's exactly right where is that theophany that the often he's there he said it's just in that sixth dimension he said it's there right up under the altar he said that body of the lord jesus when it was when it was raised on high it went to the it went to the throne of mercy it went to the altar of sacrifice and he said that body and that blood is there upon that altar of sacrifice as a propitiation for your sin right now right under that altar is what the theophanies it's the sixth dimension that's the seventh dimension where god dwells god's dwelling in the seventh dimension and right under there is the sixth dimension and that presence of god is raining down upon them in that sixth dimension they're always in the presence of god glory you can't be one bit sad for your loved one that went on leak about where they're at thinking about where your brothers and sisters are at they're there in the presence of god continuously in the presence of god they're in a body that does not wear out i remember years ago my sister-in-law got drunk in the lord during the in the fellowship meetings i had never seen anything like that it struck her she screamed she shouted she danced she went about every which away and then she collapsed and she stayed out for a whole day she didn't wake up till the next morning she went down you go we took her and we linger up against the wall at the back of the church or the the school building where he was at how many went to thanksgiving years ago and she would we laid her up against the wall out in the hall and everybody after church you had thousand people out there milling around you know fellowshipping and having a good time and she's sitting there going she was just as drunk as drunk could be just rest and drunk in the lord after everybody for some reason we were always about the last ones about one o'clock in the morning when they finally closed the place down and we had to go gather up sister lisa carry her out to the car put her in the car or the minivan or whatever it was at the time put her in the car carried to the motel and my dad in law and her husband my brother-in-law carried her upstairs put her in the bed she didn't wake up to the next day what happened wouldn't you like to get a good dose of that again right well it's real and think about it and this body couldn't handle that but that body there that body and that theophany that body he said let us make man in our own image do you think that thing has changed that thing ain't changed when god created it in genesis chapter 1 there is nothing that has happened between genesis chapter 1 and now that has diminished that there is nothing that has taken away from that there is nothing that has that body is unhindered that body is resting it does not have obstructions it does not have anything to restrain it it's sitting in the presence of god or standing worshiping in the presence of god it cannot get tired and it's look and look up and it can see the lord brother branham said he could see the lord on the altar glory to god i'm not just getting to shout and fit here in a minute amen my legs ain't near so tired now i tell you what amen they're sitting there looking at that looking at that precious body of the lord jesus christ but here's the kicker it looks that way god looks this way we look up down here we look up and we cry out through the blood of jesus and brother branham said he don't even see us what does he see he sees that blood what's just beneath that blood the theophanies he sees those theophanies he sees a word body that was created in his image perfect from the very beginning it never sinned it never fell it's never hurt it's never had pain it's never been sad it's never it's none of the things that don't have the quirks and the faults and the problems that we have down here it don't have those things and when god looks down through his blood he sees that perfect body that word that he spoke before the foundation of the world and we say oh god we did this and we did that and god says i don't know what you're talking about i'm looking at a perfect man hallelujah glory to god amen do you see a thing i ain't even got to daniel don't look i'm going to do it do you see a thing what was this vision that caught daniel's eye he saw a thing he saw the redemption of israel he saw the redemption cycle it's not just the redemption of israel he saw he saw our redemption he saw the redemption cycle is what he saw supplied to us too hallelujah and what did he say we're going out of here i'm going to end on that note right there this afternoon we're going out of here amen hallelujah we got it out our faith is unhindered don't worry just when the bodies when the body kicks up and when this happens or the circumstances get overwhelmed and everything else i want you just to pull back and say you know what it's okay praise the lord it's okay with the lord jesus it's okay there's nothing going to hinder me there's nothing going to slow me there's nothing going to turn me around i'm going on with jesus stand with me if you would here this morning amen hallelujah are you going on this morning are you going to keep walking this morning you're going to keep keep keep pushing amen put one foot in front of the other this might sound sacrilegious you'll forgive me if it does but i've told my wife and a few others i've got a new motto when our kids were growing up they watched that little cartoon of the the fish they were trying to find the fish or trying to find the fish's sun or something i don't know what they were doing they're swimming around the ocean and there's a little fish down there she was crazy she was out of her mind and she would say the man was getting the boyfish was getting all discouraged and all just tore up and everything else everything was going wrong it's kind of like life it always goes wrong seemingly right and he asked her what do you do and she said well you know
