========================================

and it wants to watch and we're going to read it later but Daniel 9.4 and then we're going to go back to here for a second son Dave seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city now that's going to be key if you've got a Bible look where it says people and the holy city so this Daniel 70 weeks is not just to the people now who has the people the people who is Daniel's people the Jews not in South juice right and what was the holy city Jerusalem so he's talking about the Jews and Jerusalem this seventy weeks of Daniel the restoration of Israel has two parts Daniels people the Jews and the city it's not even to Daniel because later on in chapter 12 God says Daniel rest with your people in other words you know knowledge will increase and and all these things it's going to be at the end time because look what's just run here let's see let's go back verse 21 now Daniels praying and Gabriel comes to him when at the time of the evening oblation so in the evening time is when this revelation is to be made known all right Gabriel comes in the evening time to Daniel in telling seventy weeks are determined upon down people upon the holy city select two things to finish the transgression make an end of San make reconciliation for iniquity bring everlasting righteousness sylhet division and prophecy and anoint the most holy now that six things six-fold purpose of Daniels be our Gabriel's visit to Daniel know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem your city unto them aside of the prince who is that Jesus Christ shall be seven weeks there's one period and threescore in two weeks now what is three scoring two in the Bible three score is 63 x two three times two is six so that's 62 weeks got it if I got that same ankle this is going to be the base of the whole way seven weeks and three scoring two weeks what does that add up to 69 weeks everybody got that 69 x 70 69 ways all right the street shall be built again in the walls even in trouble as times and after three scoring two weeks after that sixty two week period Joe Messiah be cut off Jesus was crucified all right but not for himself it was it for the people and the people the princess shall come shall destroy the city now who is that friend that's Titus in AD 70 he will come and destroy the city and the Saints where he said he tore everything apart that's why that Israel is trying their best to go back to temple worship but Titus took the menorah he took all those things they're supposed to be set up the original ones and took them to where the Vatican all right took them to the Vatican that's why everyone's going to make a pact with the Vatican to get all these things back so thanks dr. temple or check this is very simple it's happening right now that's really and after three score 2 weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people who prances yo come shall destroy a city in the sanctuary and the end there else you'll be able to flow into the end of the ward this way the terminal now if they're 69 weeks and the Messiah gets cut off how many more weeks had left to make 70 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that who's that he that's not Jesus Christ because this person breaks the Covenant alright so this must be the Antichrist is my capital age it's a little late and he shall confirm the covenant with me for a half a week oh it says one way and in the midst of the week what is the middle of seven and a half three and a half plus three and a half at seven in the middle of the week in other words after the prophets who prophesied 1260 days he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease in other words amount of sin then enters in the templates that you got to worship me no more temple worship you got to worship me because that's the amount of sin that's the Antichrist the Pope because he's going to cause the sacrifice and oblation isn't offering the seat and for the overspray abomination he shall make it desolate even to the consummation so this is going all the way the consummation and that determines you'll be poured out upon the desolate so you got a seven-week period a sixty two week period make 69 then you've got a one-week period so I'm telling you the Bible doesn't say there's a half week left after the rapture since one week expert brother drowned God of the Bible he can't change the Bible alright we're going to read some quotes it sounds like that he's changing the Bible but he's not he's speaking because remember many times brother Brian will tell us scripture has a compound meaning cuz really people that's not to us there's nothing there is not from 25 to 27 speaking nothing of Gentile alright nothing speaks nothing of Gentiles this is all to Jews natural juice siwy spiritualize it because it took 70 weeks for reduction it took six Bowl purpose to get them redeemed it takes six heels to give us Redemption all right so that's a long way down the road so the redemption of Israel and but it can't be just of Israel why do they think so much of that little place called the mosque of Omar that's where the temple original temple was built jesus said in Matthew when you see the abomination in other words the mosque of Omar and I having the world unless the Providence of God how in the world with the Jews allow the Muslims to come in and put a mosque right on the city ground it had to be the Providence of God knowing that that thing's got to be destroyed that's the abomination right there all right the Jews hate that it's like mom and dad were there you know back in the 90s and up under there they're trying to dig far enough them Jews are trying to get so close to get back to temple worship we Gentiles don't need temple worship we know God's already come but they're trying to get back temple worship so in a lifetime the Messiah right so this is all to the Jews but it has implications to you and I because the Mossad did not get cut off for himself what he he was cut off for all of us died for every person Jew Gentile alright so there's your basic of Daniel 70 weeks but now remember to thank people and city people and City you have to separate them once you separate them you can understand down 70 weeks a lot better but the son of David is heir to the throne all right now the son David is not now remember this is the son of God dispensation this is the son of man dispensation just for a little while to give us a body change and take us out of here alright then he goes immediately as the son of David actually goes to the son of God to preach through the two prophets but when they realized who he was who Jesus was we're going to read that next sunday will go back into his eq in places where they they recognize who he is and they weep and cry because they know the Messiah's supposed to come and alive is supposed to come first membra did that series on the five cups of Elijah they literally every year they said up down for Elijah at their meal they go outside and look fifties come if you hadn't come then shut the doors and well next year in the world in their language they say until next year will see the Elijah that we know brother branham the forthcoming of Elijah has already come preach the message and he's gone well they are looking for a lighter he said why if they're often okay runoff remember the fifth coming of Elijah is the spirit of Elijah to the Jews so he is coming before the Messiah comes true hey Matt Moses absolutely CD there you say well they're just far off they're not far off they're closer than we are really as far as literally knowing that something's gotta happen but the Bible's don't tell them you missed him this was who was so you know what to do but what do they do they go into their homes they cry they weep and all that now that we're going to die remember though remember what brother BAM used about Jonas when Joseph revealed himself to his brethren they said all now we're going to get killed and these things are going to happen and you know all these bad things and children said no it was done to preserve life I'm not mad at you Jesus it's not going to be mad at them when he comes at the son of David he's not gonna be mad at them when he comes take him out of here right he's not mad at you he's the one that blinded them so that we could come in the Gentile bride he looked at us and wanted he knew you know what he knew we were a bunch of renegades I'm just gonna ditch his mother brother wait Dale version he knew we were a bunch of renegades we didn't care about nothin we had no you know the Jews they got a this day and this day and this day and you gotta do this and you know you watch the cups and sacrified you know they had an order of everything checked i'll hold onto or him we're just nations bunch of job had to go up you know God knew he had to come to us first he had to get out that Gentile bride first because if he would have took and not blinded those Jews when they said let his blood be on us and our children and he had not blinded them so they could say that they would have accepted them aside and they would for the right room that's just the way I said because what happens is let me just let me just give it to you playing it took from Jesus to this day two thousand years for us to get Jesus right and we're still ain't getting right yet man we're still here once we get him right as when we going to rapture when those two prophets preach they're only gonna preach twelve hundred and sixty days three years they're going to accept this message that we've took even 50 years to try to understand the message and still don't get it right they're going to get the message in three and a half years and they're very rapture so you see how you see how their foundation our foundation is nothing happy-go-lucky or general that's why remember we had he said I've never seen no more faiths even people that you say have faith unless they saw something you mean sign give me up give me this give me that Gentile woman said gaylord the dog the off the table I've never seen a little faith Centurion says look if your amount of authority I'll Atlanta party whatever you say that's what happened he said I've now find no greater faith and Ezra blind because all that there's our life Jews are all going well is he doing side yes he will he did well he what he ain't this and he he's a devil and he see what grow up the Gentiles built on faith that's why Abraham was Gentile he was built on faith believe what God said and that's it because remember when he was here he was the son of man right well the saira Phoenician woman and will not read it because the time her brother adam said that she and in the Bible sorry in Matthew 15 she says thou son of David have mercy on me my child is backs with a devil huh brother Brown said he never even looked at never pay her a bit of attention wine because she had no claims on him gonna go see Johnny's my sister he's my sister in the lord she's a very dear friend of mine but I can't call her why she's not my life I can't manifest myself to life but now I got a live setting here spam I can manifest myself it's definitely because she's my wife same way with Jesus Christ when he comes that's why he couldn't come to the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time everybody got their right hey man he can't do that he he cut the Jews off so he could get a Gentile bride but he said I'll never forgive him so he goes over here any potential backup but during the time he never paid the woman attention now listen but now blind Bartimaeus with the Jew Jesus was walking down the street he says thou son of David have mercy on me will he turn plan he had he had control or he had the manifestation of the son of David children for part of ass blonde bertalanffy right but now the Tsar Phoenician woman she didn't she was a Gentile she was at all he called her a dollar yes alright he called her a doll but she said yeah but we need the crumbs off the master's table he said I've never found when I was like she said Lord good evening she said the Lord even the dogs get the crumbs off the table Brown said when she said the Lord he immediately turned and manifested itself as her Lord but not a son of David that's why that Putin and most people in the message will tell you the Dana 70 weeks is off to the Jews a man that's true but if we don't get Redemption first they don't get Redemption so knowing that they are going to be redeemed shows me that I can be redeemed hey excuse me because we're going to be redeemed first sunny guys son of man come in flash Jesus Christ Sonny talk to the church ages and son a man here in the end time and then now he's going to go to the Jews as the Son of God but they're going to see him as a son of David that time of the Ministry of the two prophets will get into all that I'm trying to just lay a background for you to start thinking wheels turning here I just want to let everybody know that the Daniel 70 weeks is so it's such a big topic amongst the message when I was in the car over it was even brought of it okay yeah but is it is it you know about the week so looks like i told you that brother it's in the Bible it said one week right after the massage cut off now my lord when was he cut off a t30 when they killed me then you have a time of the Gentiles then you got one more week left natural week not a ministry week not a tribulation week one week of natural time because that 70 weeks is it was a natural time all right okay thank you because I got to mention this first Daniel with in captivity it was the 68 year of his captivity brother Brown said he knew in two more years he read my books we're going to read it next sunday from it he will look back to what Jeremiah God told Jeremiah there would be 70 weeks that they would be in captivity and after that they would go out Daniel had been in captivity brother Graham city wing captivity winds about 12 years old here he is later on in life and he wanted to know that's what he was praying God what how are we going to do this how are we gonna get out what are we gonna do when we get out to bondage and he had two years well well brother brown said Daniel was so Daniel was so intent on knowing that God didn't just show him one there were two years where he showed him all the way to the Millennium all right all right the guy that he might have any questions so far on what we just said really I mean if you do then or something you didn't understand me saying cuz we're going to go through this protects us a year then so what its gonna bring us a year but what you got to do is you got to be intent and focus you have to be intent and focus that we get this right that you because see I can walk up to anybody and a crowd i'm taking thousands and ministers in the message and i stand up feeling like we did it before and challenging because i know what the property god will say it and I know what we gotta have to place this thing is right for it because remember if you nail it down the people in the message don't like this book I had somebody this morning him me a book and says I haven't read this book in a long time I don't read it much you know what they don't understand it you read something you understand yes do you read something you don't understand maybe once right I keep that book Jim's god I keep that one because most people have that book this more wore out really than this when I put this one up the one Jim's got I keep it in my briefcase with my Bible everywhere I go and what's in my Bible is the chart most people don't even know brother drowned chart and I have this for you to have his own now look let me take some about this will hold this up so people that's it brother George Smith himself told me this was typed by Rebecca Rebecca is the one that drew this picture during the series of the day and seventy week because remember brother bouncing baby that looks like a girl never he started talking about the little image they let a girl go then dress all right what's what sister Rebecca did is is later on after them after the service she drew it out and if you'll notice this is old typewriter type to let it go click click big thing that was what was in the 60s so this was grown by william branham so this is not i think people draw charts and charts and charts and they never do why because they can't prove their doctrine with his chart can I do it I've seen other drawings that are not right but I keep a baby with me all the time and there's another one and this was kind of strange run lower ground which is in florida right old brother he's 80-something years old somebody asked he was with another brother now his son brother Keith Brown brought this to us when we were doing a damn seven two weeks eerie hey somebody asked brother branham to draw it again about three or four days later in a restaurant he drew it on a napkin and they made a copy of it if you want to know this is a brother blame Dean he's spoken word Outreach Center drawn by brother william branham for a brother that was at a restaurant with brother venom in 1961 and it's the exact same chart as he drew here ok so there's my confirmation that that chart right and so I have both here they one of each and pass them if you already have one get another one I made 30 of them I thought more people would be here then they are because ok the way you have any charts of the other ones that will have drawn that are a threat uh well the one in the building maleva morning ed eat bad anyway you know say it online ok listen I'm gonna tell you something if we were one word off out of the Garden of Eden we can't be one word off and take a body changes and listen when we hire ministers meeting I didn't do it but I'm gonna do it forever telling us again they don't believe what brother Brown said in this book when they brought their ideas and dare thoughts they never read a quote out of this book right here they always read the quotes out of the church I mean out of the steelbook and and they danced all around it but I want to tell you something and I'll make it plain brother Geoff Jenkins is the one that brought this everybody's attention and he said brother Randall was wrong in Daniel 7 new weeks series and he didn't know what he's talking about couldn't get his dates together right now that same devil is on them people that won't take what's in this book because they're denying what the property God said write you're denying the Prophet I'm one of you because you know brother Graham said in this book seven times that there's one week left after the rapture he says thus saith the Lord was the Lord Rome know they sell well he corrected it in the seals show me where he corrected it show me where he said I was wrong no he kept going back saying man this is why we had to get the damage them to ensure the people misunderstood what he said absolutely cuz he said I misunderstood alright get one of each and then pass to depress them back up keep those they're yours retching a minute and fold it over and put it any day insane two weeks book right but that to me is is the drawing that the properties are drew during the time of the day of 70 week series okay now i'm not trying to i'm not trying to belittle people I'm just trying to tell you this church what we believe because some people have asked and I want you to be able not to say that berlinale I want you to be able to say I can show you in the Bible and I'm show you in the property message was probably go out talking about okay jesus said eat my flesh great my blood jesus said many things somebody was questioning about being a Christian I'm sir okay being a Christian what do you think about men agreed was being kind and nice and good and that's okay Christian is Christ light right be like Christ Christ took a road and drove a bunch of people out of a temple Christ said one day said for say father mother sister brother and follow me Christ said one day let the dead bury the dead christ said one day he said you generation of vipers you snakes and he stood up in a minister's meeting and call them all hypocrites now boy it's like brother Brown said he said if you looked at the kind old priests they looked at Jesus he said you'd pick the Congo priests every time but what happened was Christ is doing it out of love okay so that's what I'm saying Christ can do this out of love that he can show us what the prophet of God was talking about in the Daniel him two weeks ago cuz truly back to their full club the son of david has nothing to do with with the gentile the son of David was a promise and we'll carried on that sunny the son of David was a promise that God said that David come he loved David so much he said David your son will sit and judge the twelve tribes of Israel when I sure Solomon did it in the natural but he had a flaw okay remember the end of Sullivan's life he got he got a hold of two women and they turned him into idolatry and that's human that's cause you did not withhold ago and it's all alright but now this one to come had to live a word inside of him that was the son of David that the Bible was talking about right which was Jesus Christ now son David have mercy on me Bartimaeus got what he asked for sorry Phoenician woman it wasn't time yet for her to be calling him the son of David alright so in the Millennium when we all come back and there were things over the Jews have been restored the temple has been restored and all these things he's going to sit he's an heir to the throne he is going to sit in the Millennium remember the Millennium it's not to us Jen and I got married and then we went on at anyone a week or so Heyman right okay so that's what Jesus he we marry him here we go on a honeymoon for a thousand years we're there and letting the Jews fulfill all that Old Testament Jeremiah Ezekiel Daniel all those things for the juice those Gus said I'll never forget you I'll never forget to do he can't forget though they've got people they were God's original bride so he's going to bestow all the things look I don't now they're getting killed and people hated you but one day that 144,000 and all the Jews from all the ages are going to be in that millennium in that temple around that temple and Jesus Christ is gonna sit on that throne and its Brides going to be around him and we're going to be there from any moon there's nothing I mean listen people literally they're still in time the Millennium is a time element it's not an eternal element it's a time element because what's going to happen is we're going to be taken away God's going to rain fire and burn everything off again and then the new city is going to come down where everybody's going to live for an eternity so the Millennium is the space of time one thousand years okay but there is things that goes on that we gotta get to the Millennium let me give you this point if the six mo purpose are the six seals remember programs and 60s finishes redemption for the seven seals Jesus Christ all right so six seals finishes Redemption so does the six fold purpose redemption for Israel and then they accept Christ and we all go in the William so whatever takes us in the millennium has got to take the Jews into the Millennium all right got that so just think about that and run around in your head for up for the rest of the time but the son of David is not to the Gentile it's only to the Jew but the benefit we get is we've already married to this guy that's right we're married to it right where his bride even the hundred forty four thousand that's not as bright their units their unix they're there to what to minister to us right to help us and it not be cervix like servants but they are like you know me and Jim husband a while but sister Trudy she's good friend of ours she you know things we do all together but she's not my bride because she's my sister and the Lord she's my sister but she can't claim me as husband in the Millennium then claim him as what King David the son of David Jesus Christ sitting on the throne that's their king but his bride is going to be us sitting around the chrome because theme we accept this it you're now they rejected him and then they're going to have to be what give their life and all those things for that so it may any question real quick before we go yes if we don't understand read the first part right here first part of that foot the forward that's exactly what he said the reason is the reason that so important is is the placing of the seals the placing of the plays and the vowels in the woods is to placing sure you can get an understanding of the seal no problem and not understand Daniel 7 new weeks but you can't get the full revelation of what those seals are about unless you get the full revelation of what nine seven two weeks is about this what do you say good look if you can't understand the redemption of the Jews you can't understand your full redemption that's why we're burying people we don't understand a full part of redemption I mean let's just be honest we don't understand the full part of redemption and listen we all don't because love this thing is getting old that's why me and brother Darrell was talking about Jesus God Himself got old everyday anyone that he didn't understand he was just born in this world brother round look like he's 70 years old with you 56 years old when he died that's my age I'll be 56 in January he looked like he was 70 years old one cuz it beat this thing up this thing right here is what's going to have to change the seals changes this body period if don't take a body changing you can forget about 19 a week but since it's already in the Bible and it's already turned and some have already made it then let's back up we got to be redeemed body spirit oh okay and he said his other dude well all the Jews are blinded not just gonna see 144,000 so they excel the message they weren't allowed when Jesus was born it was his people because we're going to read it next Sunday the Jew said let his blood be on us and our children so what our generation but there's a generation that's promise we'll be in Revelations then there's going to be twelve thousand from each tribe brought out and given eternal life all right or give them two wholly-owned all right same thing okay let's go brother Darryl Willis your name n'oublie show
