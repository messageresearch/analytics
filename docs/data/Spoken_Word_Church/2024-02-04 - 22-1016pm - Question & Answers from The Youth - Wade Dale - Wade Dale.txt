Sunday brother collie help me here make these announcements for me would you please but just remember these things I know you forgot everything I already said just now so just keep these things in your prayer so let's go to the Lord in prayer we've got four questions how to approach youth counts the dos and don'ts of cording yeah and we have we have is it wrong to pray for your team to win when playing a game such as football game well it's Georgia yeah for sure uh number four is talks a little bit about marriage and divorce but it's it's a calm way to talk about it and the last one but not the least one do we fall in love with Jesus just like getting married spoken from a true child amen all right let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day Lord and I pray that you'd be with us give us this day our daily bread father we're just a family here group Lord and I pray that you just be with us Lord all the functions and things we do we want to do it Lord for your honor and glory and we also want the people to feel at home we want all all of us to feel like one big family Lord I pray that you just be with us now and answer these questions Lord if there be any other questions Lord we pray that you just answer them while these are being answered father thank you for the ones that have asked the questions Lord and many times we look over the the youth but father there was one day when you were here in human flesh you sat down one day as it was you just sat down on a partk bench and the kid started coming around you playing and all the disciples they didn't like that but you rebuked them and said leave them alone cuz such is the Kingdom of Heaven you have to be like a little child to enter into the kingdom father we know we start as a child Lord but grow into adult so father we pray that you'd be with us now as we answer these questions Lord May they'd be done for your honor and glory be with the ones that are sick ones that are not with us Lord be with the ones on the Foreign Fields we haven't prayed for the missionaries Lord much we pray that you'd be with them Lord there's still some out there that's laboring in father in the different countries we pray that you'd be with them Lord take care of each one Lord in the fur of this service in Jesus name we pray amen we don't have a scripture to read so you can be seated I think we maybe couldn't read the scripture that brother Luis is reading the other night think on these things and I think I have a quote that he quoted the other night so we want to start with number one how to approach youth camps now there has been many um opinions um attitudes toward youth camps all right over the years uh we've been involved sister June and I um the kids growing up here brother Boyd and Sister Janet different ones we go to these youth camps and started in about 1999 to 2000 we went all the way to what 2006 or 8 or something with in Alabama and then we supported other youth camps now there are some that we can't support all of them but most of them we do try to support because the ones we know of the preachers that preach at these youth camps are not going to preach Doctrine so much to where it's going to confuse the people cuz it shouldn't do that you should preach salvation you should preach how to court how to how to get married how to how different things like that and that's usually what well 99.9% of the time that's what's being preached so the re the way uh the brother asked he said how should I approach going to a youth camp well going to a youth camp number one is you want to support your kid to go all right um there's a fine line that that I see that either you can tell ask them listen if you ask a kid to do something and you're a parent most of the time while they they going to say no right Bella shake your head yeah but it's a no right okay so and I don't agree with making them go but when I was growing up we didn't have a choice to go to church we went we went until we got married we went until we got married right Jim right Dad and Mom we went there wasn't no uh playing around so there is a fine line there you can make them go and I've seen them be so miserable but you know where that starts from the home corre should I read the quote where brother Brown said it wasn't juvenile delinquency it was parental delinquency what you say at your home about the pastor or what you say about the church or even what you say about youth camps it goes right over into the kids correct if I'm wrong somebody stand up and correct me it's that way it's been that way forever that it's what the parents say just like anything else the parents are only the kids are only going to say what the parents say just way it is so if you down youth camps and you make them so horrible it's nothing more and I know there was one old Minister he told me one time he said it's just a place for kids to go and get married and find a mate and that's it well that's not all it but you know what I'd rather them go and find one there than to go and find one at The Honky Tonk or at school or at a bar or wherever you want to talk about I'd rather him approach a youth that's at least maybe got a little bit of structure at home being a message Believer from a believing home now we have seen and Jun and I being counselors and Bo and Janet and different ones of y'all but we were for a stretch there about 8 years that we were counselors you've seen them that it wasn't going to do a bit of good to help them you know I mean you try to get them to do right and Junes had to get lipstick off of the ceilings and and all thing you know you're not supposed to lipstick at a message believer's Youth Camp how' that happen but it did you know where they got it from home if you most of the time look at their mom no I'm not going there never mind so anyway you look at the tight dress of the mama and you look over at the kid telling it's parental delinquency I'm telling you blame the parents don't blame the kids the kids like I told you the one of the most I wish I could I'm going try to find that book the book was called children are like wet cement cuz wet cement you can make any kind of impression you want to but if you leave it there when it hardens how many of you have built on to your house or built a a porch on your house I know brother already did at our house 20 something years ago well here we go we start pressing our hands into this into the cement you know and and got their Deana wasn't even born the kids were little you know they were pressing their hands in 2001 what it's still there so the impression that we made 20 something years ago is still there today same way with us about anything Church what to do at functions well I'm going just let my kid do what they want to do well that's probably why some of them are not here now you know what I hurt your feelings I'm sorry I've been hurting people's feelings I'm I'm sorry that I do that but I want to say one more time if I'm lying to you tell me I'm lying but if I'm telling you the truth you got to be a child of God you got to take it sorry I mean if I'm we out on a limb and tell you you got to do something that ain't in the Bible then yeah you you you you just tell me right now but if I can put in the word of God and the prophet's message and what brother Dale's preached to us for 50 years whose fault is that and I fell short too I have one that does not come to church so I'm not I'm pointing at me too we're all on the same level like I said before selfishness we don't need to be selfish right the most unselfish thing is to want everybody to be saved everybody regardless amen now I don't we don't need to be preaching I need to answer these questions Bob you got to stop me but listen what I want to see if an approach to youth camps number one I want you to do is expect something from God you know you're going to see other people you know you're going to see people and usually you're going to be put with people of your age group is that right right I mean that's what we've been you know even Alabama you put the group over here and you put a group over here you don't want to put 18-year-old kids with six-year-old boys they ain't got they can't they can't interact but you put everybody together so what the reason we come to church is what is that we can fellowship and we can learn from each other well that's the way a youth camp should be when you go to youth camp you should go and say look I'm going to get something for god listen if you find a friend that you can converse with online orever how you want to do that that's a bonus if you find a girlfriend and you're a boy then that's an extra bonus we're going to talk about that a little bit later on do and don't of courting and dating and all that stuff but I believe you should go expecting something from God because once you get something from God all that other stuff seek you first the kingdom of heaven all right now I know too that kids are are just in emotional bundle is that all right feelings you know de today she said I hate these pimples she I hate these pimples I said I have them too sometimes I'm 63 years old but they don't bother me amen but see it bothers them though you say well it doesn't bother me cuz I'm 63 it doesn't bother me it does bother her because of the what she presents so what you present and so be careful and like if you if you'll just see every one of these questions every one of them you can answer them the same way courtship dating right is it wrong to pray for teams win you know teams and brother R said uh talk about Adam and Eve all this is going to be pulled in together because look what is a woman she's a bundle of nerves yeah right nervous she leans to her emotion every time the prophet said right that's why Paul says you don't want a woman to be preaching because she's going to preach her emotion all right she's going to she's going to be the Mama she's going to be the mama that that's oh well it's okay now there's a balance we know that but a woman shouldn't be preaching in because the first preacher was Eve and what did she do she messed it all up because of what because she was working toward her emotion we'll get into that in just a few minutes cuz when Adam and Eve were separated the emotional the sweet the gentle the the mother part that was in Adam now is in a woman called Eve and Satan could look at her and watch her through her life and say I can get to that I can't get to that cuz he's the manly one he's the one that he's the one that you know I got to build a house I got to kill the not at that time but you know the mentality is the man's got to build a house keep the keep the place clean kill the deer drag it home you know clean it and let the wife cook it amen you ought to try that sometime but that's the way it is when when God divided he wanted to make because guess what you and I are a Tope of that we are Eve right we're the second Eve so we have the emotion and we have all we like the emotional part but we're also more acceptable to lies than Christ was amen so we'll get to that in just a few minutes well maybe in a little while so how to approach Youth Camp let me read something a brother brother Paul La Fontaine U Brother Joseph has them and they're on our website somebody asked him about the same thing so I just want to pull a few things out of here three main points that he makes and one Ministry to young people is important because of the age that we live in much could be said of the carefully designed enticement from Satan directed toward youth in the last 50 years and that's exactly right if Satan can get the youth he's got the Next Generation that's what he's doing that's why brother Brown said every generation is getting weaker and weaker worse and worse all right so and and you know what that's not God's doing that's the devil's doing cuz he knows there'll be another Generation all right if we have another generation we got to have some sisters that keep their virginity so they can marry and have preachers and they we're going to have deacons and we got to have song leaders and we got to have players of instruments that's the Next Generation Well they just not not developed like this they've got to be developed over time everybody with me young people are so blinded by the spirit being things behind things of this age without the Holy Ghost and down toe wisdom from God they'll never be able to see through this mess and he's exactly correct you'll never be able to see through this unless you've got good quality preachers good quality Ley good quality the Bible says the younger the older should teach the younger all right and let me tell you something a good key to your success kids is to listen to older people listen you may not listen to your mom and dad cuz they're idiots mine was till I got about 30 then they just smarted up just they just everything they said was right and everything backwards was right amen come on admit it no you're the idiot Until you realize that they were that way all smart all the time Luke you can tell your you can tell your mama that you tell your mama that too Lucas you can tell your mama that too I'll tell her tomorrow actually when I see Justina I'll tell her tomorrow Luke said you crazy ding dong but without the Holy Ghost and down to earth wisdom from God they'll never be able to see through this mess the young people have always always needed Direction and that's right never think your kid is going to do right all the time that's where Eve fell by thinking she was doing the right thing all the time everybody with me all right so I think that's really good but they will need it more in the end time than ever before listen can I be just let me just be down to earth when I was growing up when I was 12 years old you going to think this is funny and and I'm sorry but I'm going to try to make a point that some of you get some of you will get some of you won't get because it's just kids 12 years old playing on the playground at 12 years old well maybe close to 10 or 11 in Gillsville there are the places still there I got my beehives there but the the old gy is there well we just happen to be crawling under the gym keep put your fingers in your ears and we found a magazine that had some things in it that you shouldn't be looking at lots of them about that thick somebody had poked it up in the probably some back in Daddy's days back that way that poked the no that wasn't true these were black these were not black and white they were color but anyway I'm going to make a point here I was a kid guess what I didn't go I leave that alone I'm like come on somebody and I and then at recess from then on come here Keith let me show you what I found then the next day cuz we were kids and I surely wasn't going to go home and tell Mom and Daddy what I found right that's right hello somebody we're kids human beings that's right but now look my point is I had to go to school sneak under the gym floor and sit there and read that book or look at the pictures all no not Michael but all Michael's got to do right now is pick his phone up flip it over and hit two buttons and he can see the same identical thing times 10,000 sitting right where he's sitting now see the difference I had to go to school sneak under hope somebody didn't steal a thing and and then you you understand what I mean so we had to we had to go make an effort now there is no effort right Satan will put it he's got it in your pocket it's in your pocket now it's in the kids's pocket now without Direction but listen we should not ostracize the people we're humans we're human beings right exactly sorry I didn't mean this to be this way but we're sexual creatures we're curious and we're selfish we want it for oursel amen we've all been through this the problem is a lot of times like what brother Dale said you forgot where you came from you forgot where you came from you forgot you did them little things too so let's don't kill our kids right don't shoot the people we got to love them sorry but that's what our kids are looking at today they're looking at highdefinition and devil HD huge devil they're looking at everything in HD now where we had to you know it was a grain and on a piece of paper and now it's just like boom you're it's there and even when you don't want two kids I know for a fact you go looking through look up something online and all of a sudden Here Comes something pops up and you know what that little temped thing sitting on your shoulder right here is going to say press that button right there they won't nobody know anything about that yeah well God does whether your parents does or not God does so let's go back to how to approach youth camps let's get back to that how'd you get off on that trail all right look Ministry to young people is important because of natural anxieties of their young years we just talked about that the natural anxiety come on now don't get quiet natural anxieties of their young years making the change from a kid to an adult is extremely difficult everyone has to go through it though kids listen we didn't just jump from 4 to 50 we went through the same thing it might not be the high definition you going through but it's the same devil using the same tactic what divide and conquer the same tactic divide get away get we're going to talk about this in dating and stuff if you can't take the boy you're fixing to date home to meet your parents you don't need to date that person man or woman if you have to sneak to see somebody I'd get away from that thing real quick cuz you have a different motive and so does he or she everybody with me all right so the change from kid to adult is extremely difficult everyone has to go through it besides of the inward pressure of growing growing up and want to be liked and accepted that's our problem they want to be liked and accepted everybody wants to be liked cuz you're on Facebook like me like me like me you got to like me how many likes did you get I got 4,000 likes they a't no one of them people know who you are they just like your one picture that you put on line for one second amen so don't put it don't put like being liked by having so many likes on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter wherever you want to do it any kind of social media you ever noticed that I mean you know when we were growing up we were talking about this yesterday when I play football there was um a reporter for the um local paper and he took a good many pictures but I mean it didn't take a lot but now you go to a ball game every person that picks their nose every kid that does something they've all got their cameras out 5,000 pictures and then they what posted to Instagram I'm here at the ball game look what's going on here look what we're doing here that selfie I I me me thing but that's a phase they got to go through you and I went through it before we just didn't go through it like that we went through hey they're dumb and I'm not I know what I'm doing right I know what I'm doing right they just wasn't a selfie there every 5 Second somebody driving down the road the other day and I thought man we're kind of out in bilding nowhere brother day and I have to look up and there was three cameras on a pole them little Turner you know little little bitty cameras watching everything that you do right so now we're in an age that what it's come to what everything you do there's a reaction to all right so watch this because of the inward pressure of growing up and wanting to be liked and accepted there's a pressure on the outside to make choices contrary to what you may think a youth cries out for clear-cut direction administered with real love deep down inside they may be the most rebellious thing in the world but deep down inside they need your love and affection praise God you need you want it from God right you want that deep love and affection from him give it to your kids yeah but my kids come on your kids are going to do what you did a youth cries out for clear-cut direction administered with real authentic love the more personal understanding they can be given and the more wisdom they receive from Godly sources the better amen brother Brandon recommended a special book for his teenage children to read it was called young only once by Clyde neore if you want to look that up you can look it up because brother brandom put his stamp of approval on it young only once by Clyde naramore it's an excellent book on issues they're going through as a young person now that was back in the 60s all right and this last one Ministry to young people is important because they are the Next Generation what we teach the young automatically affects the future automatically affects the future that's one we've always tried we may have failed a 100,000 times but we've tried to make get the youth involved get the youth to do stuff bring it down to the Youth Level and get have youth meetings and have things like that and I agree with what brother Paul says look if you go to a youth camp and all they do is play that's not what you're there for you're there to hear the the word of God then you can have activities that you do amen like like when we have our youth meeting here we have a youth meeting and then we go and do what we need to do as far as playing or answering questions or or playing games which is fine word comes first word comes first and then all the other activities and and and listen why wouldn't you want them to be around something word based true word based not some psychology everybody all right with this watch this they are it's better to build children than to repair men one more time it is better to build children than to repair men think about that children are like wet cement everybody with me our attention to young people is vital they are in their years of molding I believe the bride of Christ will soon be translated to Glory but until then it's important to make spiritual investments in our youth if God carries they are the church that'll carry the message on to the end to sum it up I want to remind the Church of her responsibility young among them first create an atmosphere of Faith so young people can be born again amen second make sure that the older are teaching the younger in everything by example and by instruction third seek God and understand the needs of the youth that's right well they don't need that whether it be the holy ghost or a wholesome gathering with other young people amen get them to a good youth camp meeting where they preach the pure message don't be against youth camps if they are the right kind right brother La Fontaine said his personal experience started at a youth camp the right atmosphere was there for a birth more than anything else let's be on our knees and pray for these young people like I said before not ostracize them not say well there there just no no hope for them I'm glad somebody didn't say there's no hope for me amen I'm glad I didn't get written off amen I got written in amen amen include not exclude do not separate I know it's listen it's hard to treat if you have like Kaye and Zoe then you got uh Esther and Zach you can't all get them to agree on everything together right Monica she's like oh my word and them two are twins came from came from the same time period and they both one of them's a little older than the other one maybe a few minutes but they think different right amen Zoe is the think well she's left-handed so us left-handed people we're the only people use our right mind so praise the Lord r fra right ain't that right and I told him a long time ago I said I said Zoe's going to be The Quiet One Kay's going to be the one you're going to have trouble with I mean one you're going to have to uh to watch and that's the truth right [Music] no you can say you pass me a note and say yes but you heard what I but now look but see there's an overview though that we come from the message of the hour and we come to the scripture and how to what bring them together and not make them think the same listen I don't want all y'all to think the same thing in here today God's not one like that God's one with variety but they've all got to be as we were talking this morning they they've all got to be the mind of Christ not the mind of the devil and say well we're going to take that no it's all under the mind of Christ all right I know it's tough to raise kids but get some help if you're overwhel to the kids get some help amen somewhere somehow what you smiling about your mom and dad needs a lot of help I know that but you watch these you watch these grow up and you think man I wish I had got mine that early Freedom man' Brother Gary all of us I wish we'd have got ours earlier and done just a few things different amen we all question that but listen as long as there's sucking air there's a chance amen as long as they're breathing there's a chance and you know what I'm going to claim them it doesn't matter what cuz you know what God claimed me and you doesn't matter what remember what I said this morning is when we start adding ourself and our attitude into it yeah so how do you approach youth camps I enjoy them I like them I'm glad some of you are going to uh to support it and to be counselors me and June we were for eight years at Alabama it was the very week of our anniversary and we say goodbye on Friday and hello on Monday that was it well we didn't get to see each other the whole weekend cuz we had your kids to deal with and about 600 other kids to deal with but we enjoyed it brother boy and Sister Janet same way and some of you other ones that were there but being a counselor didn't mean just being one weekend though you got to be that 24/7 be that to your kids I don't care if they 60 years old or 50 years old or 20 years old or whatever and still be be their counselor and listen it's okay to be their friend but you still got to be their parent cuz here we go with the friend and the friend lets him get along with no you can't do that bring it back to the middle and teach them the ways of God and listen don't compromise don't compromise now just for an example y'all know you know what Hannah is my daughter you going to kick her out you going to kick her out to the world and we don't want nothing to do with you you you live this filthy life I just told her I said look whatever goes on in this house is my business this is my house if you want to live here Daddy always told us he said you can live here as long as you want to he said but when you put your legs under my table and there's a plate set down in front of you with food on it you're going to do what I say when you decide you can do that for yourself you go right ahead cuz it's my castle It's Your Castle the kids one time one time Josh back there he'll tell you they they're like why do we have to do this why do we have to do that I said cuz I'm the boss and mom always said that and she never explained it so she explained it with a hairbrush so we didn't we didn't say any more about it for about 30 minutes she didn't really do that but about three times teren more than me but and Anna never got nothing so she was so but anyway but that's I mean you got your kids are your kids are an extension of you so the kids said the kids said well what can we do to be able to do whatever we want to do I said okay you ask Regina I sat him down we sat it was in the living room I sat down I said okay listen to this I said all right you want to do what you want you want to come and go when you please if you want to have beer in that refrigerator go right ahead if you want to have bring your partying in the house go ahead but this is what you got to do you got to pay the power bill the light I mean the the gas bill the Fone I ain't done yet the house payment I'm going to give you all the insurance cards you need too cuz you got to keep the insurance up and oh by the way if I need a pair of pants you going to buy them for me if I get hungry you going to put food in that cabinet for me to get food out of and by the time I did that they were sitting way back like this they're like want to do that well guess what because I'm the king of my castle that's what I do I go to work now three jobs June works we all work to provide so that's why I told Hannah I said look when you can provide for yourself will you pay all these bills buy me clothes when I need oh oh I'm sorry if the car if the car breaks down if the motor blows up sister Anna uh uh you got to buy me another car or you got to have the motor fix for me cuz you've decided this is your Castle right buddy let me tell you something that'll really put them in their place cuz they're like and I but no the greatest thing was I said okay the power bill is $140 a month the house payment is $800 a month the car payments $300 this is fictitional stuff $350 a month but it wasn't back then I said oh the grocery bills about 140 a week for all y'all or more so I had y I said look y'all going to have to make like $5,000 a month to make it and they don't make $500 a month a week I mean a month at that time so they didn't the balance sheet didn't work so guess what they did they either did what I said or they left right A lot of times they leave but that's okay that's I never forget we moved down to Gillsville um when we built our house or built on to the house so it wasn't place for Josh and Hannah to stay so we sent them over to Nanny's house at last in about a week cuz she told him what to do cuz it was her castle and about a week later I'm not joking we see we're outside and we see the here here come the road Here Comes Josh and his truck with all his stuff on the top of it Miss the Train by missed the Train by that much he was W to get away from Daleville and I mean he's like w w w Hanah right behind them they went and live somewhere I don't know where they went live but but you know why cuz they didn't want to do what they was told but it's a learning experience now cuz Josh is the same way with Josh is like yeah de is going to do the same thing but you see what I'm talking about raising kids give them parameters so I give Hannah parameter I said look you can't bring nothing in here this evil no drinking no smoking and she smokes but she smokes outside I'm just telling you real life I'm sorry that's just family but she don't bring it in the house I'll let her live there she makes good money now she going to start paying rent she just don't know that yet she's not watching in so we're going to tell her later we'll tell her later she's at work actually right now but anyway so so are you going to throw them out no but I'm not going to allow that stuff to happen in my castle right and if they don't if they don't want to do do that they can leave then amen I told to my kids were like boomerangs you throw them out they come back you throw them out they come back you throw them out they come back how many of y'all have ever had that but Gary Brother [Laughter] G it's really sad no really what's really sad is now though that the Youth of this age they'll go and they'll lay with anybody in the world and have kids and the poor Grandma's raising them and Grandpa Freedom that to me that's horrible you should not have a 60y old woman taking care of a seveny old kid you can't keep up with them but that's what the world's full of cuz you know what oh he's a problem child I don't want to talk I don't want him no I don't want that no no you had them yes right brother D said you had fun having them you you going to have fun raising them praise the Lord those of you will understand that later on I hope Family Matters I guess I don't know I can hear them in Ohio They're laughing like crazy cuz they never heard that part before I don't think so thank you Lord how to approach a youth camp you should send them you should encourage them to go you should encourage your kids to do anything that's worthy of of of God helping them and even playing sports I don't have a mind of people not of playing sports I we daddy like to got throw out of the message me and ter play basketball and we graduated high school and look Anna was really a siner she went to college well so did I in Terence but I we didn't stay but but that's the way the message was though you get 16 years old get the kids out of school put them to work CU education of the devil they just didn't realize brother ROM all his kids graduated high school and one of them went to school went to college education is of the devil if you'll let it be you know what anything's of the devil if you let it be but education and I understand what he's talking about this liberal junk that they teaching now yeah you shouldn't teach your kids that you should homeschool them if you need to amen but I believe that a good education will help you how many times have we told you get a good education cuz you going to need it further your education if you can and if Sports gets you there that's fine if getting scholarships gets there that may that's fine but get you an education a good education amen amen all right are we good with that so how to approach the Youth Camp I'd send them and if you kids are going which a lot 12 of you are going to to the bethl camp have a good time visit people there's some people there you already know but let the Lord do something in your life first and then all these other things will work theirself out and you might meet Mr R but he's got to go through me first huh yeah ain't that right right if you meet Mr Wright that's okay and that's what we're going to talk about next the next thing somebody asked about the dos and don'ts of courting so this kind of all goes together the dos and don'ts of courting now I was looking up something brother brandham never said the word dating right if you'll look it up on put dating in on your fio views he never mentioned dating it was always courtship okay or he might have said went on a date but he's talking about when you say dating that means he talked about that subject he never talked about the subject dating because listen dating and courtship are different as night and day dating is way different than courtship cuz what dating is I looked this up a little bit online and I did look what brother m talked about courtship dating it there's no clear purpose of what you're doing you're you're just going out on a date maybe missed the right maybe missed the wrong you better find out real quick but the dos and don'ts of dating you got to start somewhere yes everybody with me you got to start somewhere brother brandham even had to what had to court or start dating remember he had to go ask what's his name Mr BR brombeck or whatever her name was Hope's last name was had to ask him if he could date them see that's a good guy yeah and they courted and then they got married all right so me was the same way brother Brown didn't just up and God just says like a chest piece here's your queen right he did me I didn't get any amens out of that not a one not a one amen amen but that's what you got to do though you as human beings you you're just not going to know exactly who your mate is from the get-go he's the one no he's the one for the moment everybody with me you got to get to know that person but you got to get to know that person under the supervision of your parents everybody with me I think we covered this a little bit many years ago when we were doing the U um what was it family matters uh but I'm going to do it a little bit more in depth because dating there's no clear purpose you just say well I'm going going to date all right but then now courtship has a different end than dating courtship is a little more brother R talks he says it's a it's on the basis of an agreement now he does talk about courtship but he courtship and puts it in with the way we Court Jesus Christ the way that we come together in a courtship with the Lord Jesus all right cuz it's not a marriage first it's justification sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you don't get married right at the GetGo even with Jesus Christ even though you know that he's the one you know you still got to go through uh uh justification and sanctification same way with your with your dating you know you may have have to date some person but man I'm talking about I'm talking about just going and sitting and talking or maybe go you know go get a uh Chick-fil-A or something like that the reason I said that is cu you should be on church on Sunday and Chick-fil-A ain't open on Sunday so anyway that's right praise the Lord see I work that in pretty good huh so yeah thank you pretty slick every once in a while but go sit down and talk and just Converse see listen a lot of y'all do that anyway online right right this is yes okay but no you you do you start and you at least you get to know somebody right so going on a date it has like no clear purpose it has no clear end there's not a journey in dating it should be extremely short you should know your parents should like I said before if you say Dad I'm going on a date well where what's your name well what does she look like where where she from well we're just going you know no if you can't bring that person to beat your mom and daddy you shouldn't be seeing them you should not be alone now that dude might want to come and sit down with us in the in the in the living room and have a conversation I want to see if he's a good Hunter cuz I'm going to have my gun there and um cleaning it and might accidentally Let It Go off I don't know actually ain't that funny though when we got girls you like I'm so protective than your boys you're like I'm going on Dat that yeah that's just the way we are though you know with a girl you like put you put the barb wire around her you know but the guy you're like hey get up go on a date would you that's way it happens I'm sorry Michael we're just wired different everybody okay my I'll get to this point in just a minute brother Ram says in Fellowship 1960 he said now he's talking about Christ now but when we want courtship and things like that it has to come upon a basis of an agreement so if you start and you want to see this person again all right if you think well man he's he's like brother Brown said don't do the well he smells good he's got what was he talking about that girl got neck like a swan and all look at their character have we not been talking about character look at the character brother Dell always told us he said beauty is only skin deep but ugly goes to the Bone right and that's exactly right well y'all laugh if you want to and take it any way you want to I believe it's the truth I mean there are some beautiful girls out there that you would not want to marry cuz they ugly on the inside same way with guys oh brother brandom he slicks his hair back remember he talk to the girl and said why you dating that guy why you he just smells so good he got his hair slit back into a duck tail that was the thing back then just look it up if you need to all right back in the 60s you had a duct tail or you had a flat top you know and you drove a car and you rolled your sleeves up and if you smoked you put the cigarettes in your sleeve I don't know why in the world people do that but that was what you look for in that area the end this area is just wide open how many tattoos you got I ain't going to ask about the piercing part but it's all it's different so we we we're coming up today though where you really got to hone in and you got to if you want to date somebody you got to go through a process yes first name Mama second name daddy amen that's the only two processes you got but when you decide say for an example that where's mil and M not you Michael T see so Michael meets this young lady I hope she's younger than him young lady and he decides you I can use you right it's okay nothing bad maybe um I'll turn the thing off I me you talk back and forth but anyway let's just say Micha going meet somebody and he Tes her to to to milka's house and he say hey Mom this is somebody that I really you know we got a little bit in common here and milka's like fangs come out she does that right there and it's like it's like um it's like the like the Wolverine you know all these things come out let me meet her you should already brought her to begin with but anyway no he's got she she's got to through go through Mama she's got to go through mom and dad he's got to go through mom and dad you say oh I don't have to go through that preacher well just let me let me see how your end is going to be let me see how the end of this conversation is going to be get married two years later you're divorced cuz you didn't get to know him to begin with everybody with me so courting is different than dating and listen you can get a bad reputation by dating every Tom Dick and Harry that lives that's right male or female right right because what are you looking for well brother wait I got no you pray yeah you pray and then cross paths with somebody that's right and when you cross paths with that person you either say let them go [Laughter] on only only Freedom let them go on right or you want to see them again well when you do do that then that may be clicking close to the courton part but you got to take them to Mom and Dad you got to go through the Hall of critics first any remember brother talks about the Hall of critic and promise you mom and daddy is going to be the most critical people in the world Amen besides me for some of y'all but because courtship is getting a little more serious courtship there is an end to courtship right when you get into courtship you're already discussing things amen listen to what brother Brown says we take for instance the marriage for a union look now watch we find out that the marriage we find the courtship and the agreements and then the marriage everybody with me now that's the same thing with Christ and the church a courtship God calling to our heart we surrender the marriage ceremony happens and the bride takes the bridegroom's name that's what makes the bride then we take on his name same way with what courtship agreements then marriage so courtship has a specific end which is marriage parents should be involved in every bit of that amen that's when you kids you got to realize your parents know more than you do but that's the that's the whole time you're going to say nope I'm married that girl I don't care what nobody says well that's okay we'll see how that ends listen if not by the grace of God we'd all made a horrible horrible mistake in our life if not for the Providence of God knowing and I'm telling knowing that I need somebody like her can make it through that's the Providence of God that's God knowing what you need before you need it but you yield yourself to it because you know the story behind all this you know I was dating somebody else and she was going to church and getting in trouble by telling these stories but anyway make a long story short Jim didn't go to church come showed up with you know smelling like cigarette smoke wearing shorty shorts ha short hair too and mama said what in the [Applause] world looking out for me dumb old me Dearing the headlights you know swep off my feet wasn't even looking for her y'all know the story most of you know the story she's one that was said she was going to knock me off my feet I was the football player you know they knock me off my feet well 3 weeks later I got knock top my feet so anyway so mom's like what in the world here you got this girl that you're dating have I understand Janet does but and and it seems like that's the way it should have been that's why I'm telling you everything is not cut and dry cuz to look at it from the peripheral I should have never married her I had no business but look at the Providence of God right that's what I needed folks I didn't need the others same way with you you should know that you needed your husband or your husband needs you and that's why you're together that's why we've been together for 43 years had our ups and downs but you know what we're going to be in eternity together so I'm fine with that I'm fine with that that's okay with me how the Providence of God but see it doesn't always work that way though because how many people have been in train wrecks don't you don't have to hold your hands up put your hand down you have to hold your hand up but I mean a lot of people have been in train wrecks you know what I mean this is him this is her got to be and it don't work out cu you didn't put God first that's right and I didn't put God first but God put me first he knew I needed you he knew I needed her no nobody else in this world fits the mold like she fits the mold so that's what I I thank God I do and we courted for about a year and a half and um pretty much from what I can read that different ministers that that's about as long as it needs to be if you're a Believer and really it don't need to be that long because you know if you start courting here we go back to getting human again right I hope you adults understand what I'm talking about as you keep getting FR you say well we're I mean got the ring yeah got the ring you know what Gary Lor always told us when we were at Youth Camp he'd said if you don't have a ring on your finger you might can sit together but no touching and he really discouraged the sitting together right cuz you're touching leg to leg skin to skin maybe a little elbow smash or something You Know M he said now if you got the engagement ring on your finger and you come to this Youth Camp cuz it was for people that weren't married and a lot some of them were engaged he said you can hold hands that's it I mean even if the people got up and went to the bathroom we were instructed to go to the bathroom with them cuz some of your kids do the same thing they disappear for 15 minutes back there if you got a bad problem 15 minutes you can't go to the bathroom you need prayer yeah you know what you're doing you're hiding from God you're hiding from the spirit that comes into the church which is a good one and yours may not be I'm saying sorry if I become your enemy because I told you the truth the only way you won't stay in this Sanctuary is you got a bad Spirit hello somebody you're running from something that's true all right let's get back to courtship just for a minute we everybody all right it may go a little long I'm sorry but I'm going to answer all these questions because they're good questions now look you must seek the approval of your parents look if you can't introduce that person to your parents he or she is not a keeper right what's the first thing you well they want to prove of her well they want to prove of why yeah tell me why they want to prove of or you ask yourself why am I ashamed to bring them to my parents everybody okay that's it Are you ashamed of somebody you might want to live with for the rest of your life and listen everybody's got a mother-in-law that's married I had two a real one in step one loved them both they live far away what am I saying once you once you I like what a brother said one time he said it's not just binding two people together it's binding two families and this family and this family may not know each other say you met somebody from Arizona never met brother Lis and Sister Christine maybe you talked on the phone or something but you got to mold two families together then and you might have two separate total opinions but you still got to bring and overcome all that you got to bring it together cuz see my June's side of the family never were Believers and my side was that didn't make us no better than the rest of them but it didn't make us to have a different mindset cuz they always wanted to party and drink and smoke and do all this and you know we didn't want to do that so it kind of made a a separation but they understood one thing was for sure we weren't going to compromise with them everybody with me don't compromise just to be somebody's friend that's not a friend if you have to compromise your values boys and girls men and women they're not your friends they are your enemy they will become your worst friend just putting that out there all right let me read a few more of these bear with me okay men and women who choose to date often have no commitment to consider marrying the other person but in contrast courtship is undertaken only when both parties are prepared to make a commitment to marriage yes all right dating tries to answer the question how can I find the one one who make me happy courtship strives to answer that question how can I honor God and discern his Direction recording my a life partner all right so that's the difference in your in dating and that but I want to I want to get something and it's got a little bit to do marriage and divorce but I said it was but this is this is uh vanilla all right everybody with me watch brother Brown says we've seen it St in the East cuz I want you to look at something because dating girls and boys when you date that's okay that's not a committal but when you come to a place of courtship and you start talking about getting engaged you're work you're working on some territory that that you either got to make it jump into it or you got to not do it at all brother brandham says I got two quotes right here and that's why I want us to understand and I'm going to be real plain everybody with me sex doesn't make you married right the union between a man and a woman does not make you married that's right that's not it brother R said that's not it what marries you your vow is what marries you once you vow yourself to that person you're just as married now there steps you got to go through to be lawfully married the bed undefiled and God what God will honor that marriage everybody with me but to sex having sex you said well we're married no you're not married you're not married to The Vow the committal that's right let me read it right here everybody okay now I'd like to pass this on this is from we have seen this star in the east in 1963 now I'd like to pass this on before we go further is espousing he's talking about marrying Joseph because this is a Christmas message the Bible said he did yes sir now Joseph was a good man he was the son of David and he was the spouse to Mary now I'd like to pass this on before we go further espousing in the East was the same as marriage is betral now watch as soon as they were espoused they were married when that sacred vow was taken he said read Deuteronomy they were married when that sacred vow between them was taken read Deuteronomy 22:23 and you'll find out that when this woman and man agreed to be married yet they didn't take the vow for months later if they even broke that vow they were guilty of adultery so it's your vow if you promise to marry somebody you need to do that your vow is what marries you I'm reading what the quote says also read Deuteronomy there's several different things Deuteronomy and the Book of Numbers has certain things about vows if a man vow vow or a woman vow vow if a woman vow vow and she's heard for if her parents hear they can disallow The Vow because what the husband is the or the father is the head but if he allows it to happen he can't 6 months later going no I don't want you to marry that guy no if he says yes then you're done everybody with me all right look when they were espoused they were just the same as marriage the law doesn't give them a right to live together as husband and wife yet but before God when they promised one another their words were sealed in God's kingdom and to break that was committing adultery do I need to read anything else brother Brown we were married this is the question's answer we were married 21 years by the justice of the peace was it wrong yes it was wrong for you to do that marriage belongs in the house of God but being that you are married here's when you're really married you're married when you vow one to the other do I need to read anymore you're vowed one to the other not the other everybody with me all right so dos and Don of dating dating you better do it just a very short period of time pray like crazy and bring them home with you and parents it's okay to have a date night go with them make them buy you something to eat you've been feeding them for 20 years amen right let them buy you dinner you'll find out real quick if they want to be your and you be around them or or them be around you or not everybody all right with this all right we got a couple more well we got three more is it wrong to pray for your team to win when playing a game such as football now somebody we'd laugh about that but let me tell you what brother Brown said about that everybody want an answer all right here we go the influence of another 1962 this is right about time of the seal so it's okay you know what what I think I'm reading verbatim everybody has their own opinion but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president ever was in a nation was Abraham Lincoln now not because he was a republican not because he was what he was no it was because what he was he was a godly man and he was raised to serve God and he said if there is anything I want to give praise to or my life was influenced by was a Godly mother who taught me to pray and know Jesus as my savior right all your family is what you are you raise your kids in a certain environment it's got a 98% better chance to go right than it has if you bring them up in the wrong way parental delinquency bring up a child in the way that it should go and when it's old will not depart from it be brought up right teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school so here we go ready this is paragraph 39 for those of you that may want to look this up and read it this is everybody believe brother Brown was a prophet right okay all right now many times children are prone to copy off of one another they tried to copy mine I was so smart and try to press their way through school but you know I think if you'll just get it yourself then it's something that you can appreciate your good grade papers everybody with me your good graded papers you know if you're going to have a test the next day instead of running around all night getting up the next morning and think well I'll sit next to so and so they're smart and I'll copy off of them if you'll just before Dad returns thanks at The Breakfast Table that don't happen anymore that was me not him if you'll just say dad remember me today I got to take a test in chemistry or whatever it is then when you pray dad says God bless Mary or John in their test today he said I tell you it'll turn the tide remember we can have what we want if we will ask in faith believing Jesus said all things are possible to them that will believe you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he said ask abundant that your joy may be full he said I like that our teaching right say the right thing do the right thing think the right thing always be thinking right I have a little slogan do right that's your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself H and you're bound to come out right you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going right and wrong at the same time no matter how much you think you're going the other way if you're traveling directly west you're not going to ever get to East if you're going west so he's talking about a test so we always prayed at our of course you can't do that now I don't think you pray at a football game do they still do that or have they canceled that too they still do it some do some don't depends on the school district see pray over everything now I'm not going to pray that a team wins I'm just going to pray that the people stay safe that's the way I would pray regardless list who wins or not I don't think that matters to God but it does matter for them to use their talent and not be hurt and to not get in trouble amen why wouldn't we pray over our kids why wouldn't we pray if they went and played a sport or something all right amen everybody okay they didn't hurt anybody's feelings so you pray for your team to win especially if your kids are playing on it you're praying for your kid to get through this thing all right everybody okay all right number four this is kind of a long one but it kind of hooks into every bit of it says look brother brandham said that it's a serious thing when a man goes to choosing a wife you see all all these connected together and they come from totally dis separate people and brother Dale said not to joke about who's going to marry who can you please elaborate on that H can you please elabor at on that let me add this one in here now I want you to listen to this now watch brother BR said that it's a serious thing when a man goes to choosing a wife and brother Dale said not to joke about who's going to marry who can you please elaborate on that I think I just did is that okay did I did I elaborate on on that enough in the back part that we were talking about it is a serious thing especially when you get into what the courtship part listen to me the dating you can back out of if you'll do the right thing courtship when you make a vow and start talking about marriage and dates and Lily and and U Zach they come to the courtship part we're in love we're so in love brother Ram asked that guy said remember he was going to marry him he said brother R I just I just can't do without he just I just got a mad this girl you know what brother R ask him said can you do without her he said no I can't do without her for no reason at all he said well you better marry her then and so he went and married him that's the same way it is with courtship you know that's why you don't have to have a two-year courtship six-month courtship or three-month courtship if you know you've done listen do the right things bring them home show them to your parents amen yeah show them off if you're so happy with them show them off right you your parents will decide whether you need to shove them off or not so anyway so brother B say sin serious thing when a man goes choosing a wife and brother Dell said not to joke about it who's going to marry who and that's true don't judge don't don't I mean it's not my business well it all right it's not my business who Bella marries but it is but it's not my business who Bella Mar's it's a decision of Christine and Louise and their family now if

you'll get one okay we were in uh we were in Alaska on a cruise and we were where were we at Jim catch a can or something where catch can Alaska and we were sitting at a place and uh this girl was serving us you know and we was eating these big crab legs man good in Alaska and and I said well you know how we converse we said how you doing you know do you live here yeah I've lived here all my life how's everything going she was telling us some story about her dating life or something you know and I said well what's the deal up here she said well you know what he said she said there's about nine guys to every one girl because of the oil riggers because of the o business you know there's a whole group of men goes up there and there's just a few local girls there she said but let me tell

end right everybody with me all right can you please elaborate on that just what we've been talking about leave that to the individual family if they want your help they'll ask you they don't want your opinion sorry I mean it's it's a family thing it's intimate when you start looking at dating and and listen you're not there with them the whole time Mom and Dad is leave it alone if they won't counsel from from Ministry or from somebody that's that's uh full of the Holy Ghost then you know what they can ask you for it okay when we involve our own opinion is where we get in trouble we hurt feelings and all that other stuff all right I read that this morning I think in the message we start interjecting oursel in it all right now listen here's the next question this is a good one brother brandham said that man had to fall for God to manifest his attributes to be a savior he also said that man couldn't fall because he was made in the image of God talking about Genesis 12627 man so God had to make a byproduct which was Eve but if the byproduct was able to be deceived how could Adam and Eve be co-equal if one could fall and the other one couldn't Bob this one's for you don't laugh Louise you got the next one Aaron you got the last one that's a good question so the only way I can answer is is let let brother brandom try to answer it for us okay so let's look at questions and answers in 1954 watch what brother Bram says all things of Shadows and types when God made the heavens and the Earth he made the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun was gone see a beautiful type of Christ in the church the church is the Moon to give the light to the world while the sun is gone see what I mean a lesser light see and then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife as Christ in the church as husband and wife the wife being the weaker vessel all right only gives a smaller light in the absence of her husband now everybody knows that God's a male God's a male we are his body which is the female now who's the weakest we are all right so the type continues all the way through when he made the sun and the moon when he made male and female created he them even in theophany hello but when he put them in flesh he knew that was going to fall but they didn't fall when Adam was had even in her and him it's when but he had to separate him cuz male and female created he them so when he took the feminist part what the feelings the emotions right took them out of Adam yeah and put him in Eve Adam still had the masculine he was the type of Christ right Christ is the husband we are the wife he is the head we are the body who's the weakest the head or the body no the body is the weakest amen natural and spiritual I mean really we're the body of Christ and yeah we're going to we're heading towards something but we're still the weaker vessel cuz we lean to emotion even as the Bride of Jesus Christ we lean to emotion more than we do this is the word of God that's why your headship though in a church as brother Dale has been for years and years and years he's the male you're the female he's the male you're me us or the female right because Christ is the head but he uses the pastor as headship because you're the weaker vessel because it's been about a year and a half and we're definitely the weaker vessel brother Dell is a strong individual goodness gracious yeah and he's wore himself out worried about y'all and when I say y'all I mean y'all amen so we're the weaker vessel your pastor has to stand in what Moses kill them all i'll kill them all God said I'm taking every one of them out and we start all over again the pastor jumps out from around the pull pit say if you're going to take them you got to take me first God said get out of the way son I'm going to destroy this world Jesus said you got to destroy me first you got to take me first I'm standing in the gap for my people Brother D stood in the gap for the people so we are the weaker vessel Satan can get to us quicker than he can get to sorry the wife being the weaker V vessel only gives a smaller light in the absence of her husband and the church can only make manifestations of the Holy Spirit and remember the Moon cannot give light of her own so see Eve didn't have her own light she her light came from Adam amen Satan knew that though he knew she was a weaker vessel he could watch her be the not not the mother of her own children but she was mothering maybe the animals hey mother's a mother she would be motherly she would she would you know be the one that would oh this is so neat Adam's like it's okay honey I got business to take care of you know in other words I got to move mountains and all this other stuff but now before that sure they were co- equal right but Satan knew though if he could ever get them apart he didn't dare talk to Eve while Adam was there God don't sorry Satan don't dare bother you while brother Dale's preaching it's when you go home home during the week it's when he plays with you is that right amen stay under your headship what brother Brown said it's not the Moonlight it's a reflection of the sunlight so she was a reflection Adam she was a reflection of Adam but she wasn't Adam she was an individual taken apart because listen that whole type had to go Moon Sun Adam Eve Christ bride it's got to all be in continuity so God knew he had to start it listen God starts it right right so he's definitely going to end it right everybody with me Jehovah gy 1956 oh okay he's talking about Isaac it was on Sunday afternoon when he spoke to him maybe on Monday morning how's he going to do poor little Isaac he looks at him oh he loves him but I can't look at that I got to think of obeying of obeying of God so he couldn't tell Sarah what's he talking about what I just talk Abraham taking Isaac listen God didn't come to to Sarah and say Sarah your husband's going to take that boy up on the mountain and they're going to kill him God knew what she would do she'd pitch a fit right cuz the emotion That's my boy he couldn't do that God told the preacher first CU being Ley wouldn't mess it up if we got it first I'm sorry but I can't look at that I got to think of obeying God so he couldn't tell Sarah cuz you know the ladies are the weaker vessel so you sometimes you have to watch see I can't tell Sarah cuz she wouldn't understand Sarah never was too strong anyway in faith cuz she lacked she dis believe the promise but Abraham held her because the man and the woman are one the woman could not be saved in the Old Testament only by the man because it was circumcision and she had to be joined to her husband in order to receive it but in the last days God's poured out his Spirit circumcised all of our hearts male and female all right sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel you women I've holled at you now I'm going to take up for you a minute see the woman is a weaker vessel I know there can't be a bad man before there's a bad woman but men who knows that men who knows that you're are a son of God and take advantage of a woman shame on you dating let's go back to what we're talking about dating shame on you if you take advantage of a woman she's going to be the weaker vessel she's going to fall for you A lot of times more than come on somebody she's going to fall for you a lot more than he falls for her because of what weaker vessel everybody okay the woman is a weaker vessel I know there can't be a bad man before there's not a bad woman but men who know that men who know that you're a Son of God and take advantage of a woman shame on you no matter what she does she's a weaker vessel and you know that if she goes to acting unlady like take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister you're a Son of God don't do them evil things look at Joseph he was an example of you remember what happened to Joseph he got caught in Piper's wife's house and she wanted him and he don't want have nothing to do with her so he run out and left and then she told on him or told her version of it now it's taking something to redeem this Fallen woman which was typified in Eve when she fell Adam was not deceived you got to remember we preach this and preach it preach it it wasn't 's fault for the fall it was Adam's fault he was deceived she was deceived he wasn't she didn't know what she didn't know she was doing wrong cuz she was the weaker vessel but Adam went in brother R said with both eyes wide open knowing if he took Eve it would destroy the whole world now I know brother R says Eve caused all this yeah she got the ball rolling but still Adam sold us out yeah not Eve Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression Adam knowed what he was doing wrong she didn't I'm not hurting your feelings but you know I've always stood for it I don't agree with women ministers cuz it's not supposed to be that way it's why a woman's not supposed to have anything do with the church sorry I'm hurting your feelings you talk to brother Brown about it she is the weaker vessel now we find that this woman was deceived by someone quoting her the word not all of it quoting her the word look and just missed it a little bit and that's what caused all the trouble Paul says let a woman keep silent in church do not permit to speak and so forth now notice 1 Peter 3: seven watch likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto your wife right as un the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered everybody with me let me read a couple more right here look fellowship with God through reconciliation 1956 I'm going be a little long but I'm sorry I'm going to answer all these questions now Adam was not deceived no sir Adam was not deceived Adam know exactly what he was doing but Eve was deceived and Adam did not go out because he had transgressed he had not he didn't sin his sin was he took on hers Christ didn't sin amen he took all mine and yours being the weaker vessel he knew we couldn't live without him he knew we couldn't what survive without God he didn't go out he wasn't deceived he didn't go out because he's being deceived he went out because he loved his wife so much he went with her a beautiful type of Jesus Christ knowing no sin but went to hell and took our place to redeem his wife Hallelujah don't get mistaken in that now mixed up see Adam was not deceived timothy3 he was not deceived but Eve being deceived was in the transgression Adam went with her to be with her and Christ came down from heaven The Immortal God and was made flesh and dwelt among us to be one of us to die as a sinner at Calvary to redeem us back to fellowship with God again a beautiful story he didn't have to do it but he did it because of his love for the church and lost Humanity wow looking at the Unseen 1959 when God made man he made him thus for made this little certain and compartment in the man for his own Throne his control tower heart God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly it's what we're talking about this morning greatest battle ever fought the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes look that's where he's deceived that's where Satan deceived it now when he talks about man he's talking about us being the bride when he says he he's talking about us being the bride was watch that's where he's deceived that's where Satan deceived Eve by what she could see the Bible says the fruit was pleasant to her eye feelings emotion sisters understand what this what he's saying you're just an emotional bunch of nerves right get nervous about every little thing sorry and sometimes we make we as the Bride of Jesus Christ make rash decisions or false decisions oh wait a minute perfect ones raise our hand thank you that was where Satan deceived Eve by what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul now we know brother Brown talks about Soul and Spirit intertwin I mean interchangeable she wasn't dead in her soul her soul by the Genesis 1 126 man was eternal everybody with me on that okay the theophany when he pulled the theophany apart if Adam was eternal in Soul so was Eve she fell in her memory reason conscious affe imagination right so it is tonight God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of God getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his Fellowship getting Eve separated from Adam is what what Satan used remember he's a divider amen get you as far away from God as he can and then he'll try to deal with you so that man would be led by the spirit of God getting off on your own is what separated you from his Fellowship looking at what you can see with your own eyes the scripture says Sons and Daughters though are led by the spirit of God your emotions is your control and you can notice a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they never can please God but a man or woman that will not look at the things of the world but just go according to the leading of the Holy Spirit they're usually in the will of God that is the great fight tonight Satan took the eye a man's head to control him and God took his heart CU there's no eye in the heart eyes are up here this is Faith so the reason she fell is is because she was the weaker vessel she got the emotional part of Adam everybody with me she got Adam separated here's Eve that doesn't make her when I do this that doesn't make her the reason she's down here now is because what the fall the Covenant Covenant was they were both equal if they both eat the tree they're both going to die all right they both died but then you went into another where what she's now the weaker vessel very weak vessel childbearing we read all that I don't have to read it everybody okay was that good she was a weaker vessel he couldn't fall because he was what the closest thing to God she was the byproduct that came out the problem was I like what brother J for said one time the problem was when Adam when Eve come out of Adam God sewed up the slipped right remember it says he closed it up so Eve couldn't get back into Adam but when Christ the second Adam when he went to the cross and he got slit in aside it's still open for an eternity we can get back into the side of Adam amen that's exactly why that that side Thomas put your hand in here cuz that's where you're going back to this is a reason you can get back is because what the second Adam couldn't fall all right every be all right that's just the last one do we fall in love with Jesus like fall in love with getting married amen you ain't a kidding let me read this real quick and then we'll close we won't have any uh musicians or anything if you have any other questions though if this created questions then please ask them and we'll try to answer them next Sunday all right listen this is God perfecting his church 1954 now look when I get a letter from Miss brandham now she'd say dear Billy I love you so much and I'm thinking of you that's what she's saying on paper but I can read between the lines cuz I'm in love with her and I know what she's talking about you know when your wife says I love you there's something that goes on we do get emotional CU we know what she really is saying I'm a part of you I want to be with you I miss you so much all that that's the in between that's not written cuz remember one more time you supposed to love your wife like Christ loves you and gave his life would you literally give your W life for your wife yes in a heartbeat with no reservation some of you I don't know well you got to be really in love to do that I still think correct me if I'm wrong Regina that Henry would do the same thing I do he's just a he Henry's a man I like Henry Henry's good guy I miss him a lot I sure do I really I really miss him a lot I miss a lot of the older ones that that's not around here anymore the past the past on ones and the ones that can't get here sister Johnny um your wife sister Mary and different ones I just that's why I sorry if I get in trouble for stuff but I just want to see people back in church I want to see somebody that's serving God look that's getting benefits from it not me I we don't have this thing up here like we had in the Baptist Church we had 350 for Sunday school remember how the old thing in church you know they they go change it and they'd have 250 for Sunday school and $200 over here for tithing and offering that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for Born Again people that what God can use that we can what be what a body quote Tom Fall Bush I ain't going without you boy he tell me that every time me see me when I be out in the world he said ain't going without you boy hurry up in other words he's saying look I'm getting older hurry up would you hurry up so look now if somebody else reads that letter they wouldn't think much about it but I do because she loves me and I love her it's a love affair and when we're born again of God it becomes more than just a story It's A Love Affair between the believer and god wow he said reveal to babes such it will learn God's covenant with Abraham 1956 when you love him you love to do something for him to bring in souls to him it isn't a duty It's A Love Affair I I don't I don't love Jim because it's a duty oh Lord she's my wife so I got to love her you better you better yeah you better rethink that problem it's a love affair amen oh I hope that goes way down look I hope that goes way down to the fifth rib on the left side and anchors there and stays It's A Love Affair you love to do it 1956 oh this is a continuation I'm sorry paragraph e26 if you love your wife you love to do something for her now that kind of love you can't have that same kind of love for Jesus as the Greek word put one is fio and one's agapy in other words you understand what I mean fio love is love for your wife agapy love is a word is a love for God all right now filio love and agape love as we've said is two different things but when you divinely love Christ like you love your wife only it'll be greater higher level than this is down here oh don't worry you'll be about the father's business trying to win souls and praying for the sick and do everything you can because you love him you want to please him now that's the way it is with God not because you know so much but because you love him and he loves you sit down and read his love letter and he will just speak to you right between the letters the real content is the text and the context is revealed by the holy ghost from a seventh grade education guy he's doing a good job that's God doing it we know that all that would make a Methodist shout think of it brother how is it it's a love letter A Love Affair between you and your maker and he will reveal it to you as you have need of it then he's talking about going back but listen ever presentent water from the rock 1961 we'll close right here just like a love affair if you were going with a girl because you knew it was a Duty or you going with a boy when you're young mama wants me to go with this guy but I just can't stand him you read this Wednesday night you don't get nothing of him coming to see you oh if it's the same about that girl to the boy a bore the girl you go with her she bores you mama wants you to go with her because she's the type of girl that mama likes see it bores you there's no love affair am but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go see her it's a horrible thing and when he's coming to see you Ma you just wish you'd hurry up and go home l read this Wednesday night that's the same way it is with you why does he preach so long Anderson bought me some shoes a few little while ago and I don't even have them on or you would be two and 1 half hours them's the comfortable shoes I ever put on my feet but I ain't telling you what they are listen to this the same thing is it with you what does he preach so long what about all this stuff and everything see you're not in love but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning he's talking about a prophecy must have to come up that morning hanging onto every word that might be what has been talking to you about holding on it's eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance right right amen whether it's hot cold indifferent whether the people are fussing growling whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of God then you're in love with Christ you love to go to church now let me read this one right here this is the last one marriage of the Lamb 1962 and after the decision and made well let go and this is the same way it is by making a decision for Christ first thing you have to do is make up your mind whether you're going to serve God and take him as your savior same way with the talking about going into the courtship the dating courtship all right and you're not make up your mind whether you're going to serve God and take him as your savior or you're not going to do it are you going to serve the world are you going to serve Christ you have to make up your mind there has to be a decision made when you make up up your mind that you're either going to serve God or Mammon then you take your choice but the decision has to be made amen I said before God's going to make you make a decision you cannot be wishy-washy or on the fence remember who owns the fence the devil all right look and then after the decision is made that you are then comes the engagement the that you find that at the altar you've got to make an engagement before a union can be everybody with me and that's the way it is with Christ Church it has to be an engagement with Christ a pledge an engagement A Love Affair amen and then the next thing is what promises made God's making all the promises sweetheart if you marry me I'll promise I'll be loyal and true I will look upon no other woman or I'll take upon no other man or I'll do all that's a duty as a wife we have children it'll do all as a duty as a mother I'll be a housekeeper all these promises has got to me be made or should be in a correct wedding same way with your new birth amen and I was thinking today let's stand our feet I was thinking today and I appreciate every person that comes to this church cuz it is an absolute effort to get here some of you drive an hour and a half some of you drive through Atlanta which God bless your heart kind of taxing every once in a while ain't it yeah but you made you know what you make an effort God will absolutely he may not today see that's us well God I'm doing what you said I want today no you'll get it when when you need it I read it right here you'll get it when you need it you don't get it before you get it when you need it remember God's always on time he's never early he's never late he's always on time so when you need it he shows up gives it to you but you got to what take the promises of God yeah and say God I made a commitment this is my commitment this is my church I
