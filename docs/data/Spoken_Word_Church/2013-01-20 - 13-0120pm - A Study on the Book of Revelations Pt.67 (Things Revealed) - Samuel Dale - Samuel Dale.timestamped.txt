[26:15] amen good to see everybody in the house
[26:16] of the Lord you like to turn in your
[26:18] scriptures turn back where we've been
[26:20] reading Revelations 1 in Revelations
[26:24] 8 I'm going to try to finish this up if
[26:28] we can again this afternoon and then I
[26:29] would just ask you to if you will to
[26:32] start reading like chapter 11 12 13 and
[26:37] on through that way you know and read
[26:39] them and just think about those things
[26:41] and we'll be trying to uh continue the
[26:44] thought on into those points like I said
[26:48] this morning remember that from the time
[26:51] of the RX Rapture you've only got like a
[26:54] 3 and 1/2 years tribulation period and
[26:57] then it turned only into going into uh
[27:01] opening up for the millennial Reign but
[27:04] you know there's a lot of
[27:06] scriptures in there of 11 12 and all
[27:10] through 13 and all that will uh you know
[27:14] take place during that period of time
[27:17] after the Rapture of the church so if
[27:19] you will study on that I don't know
[27:21] exactly how we'll go through it we may
[27:23] hit it fast we may hit it slow I really
[27:26] don't know which way so we will just
[27:28] wait and see how that we continue on but
[27:31] I want to try to conclude this part this
[27:33] afternoon about the seals and the things
[27:36] and then going into the things that are
[27:39] related in those those points amen so
[27:42] let's just pray father we thank you for
[27:45] grace and love unto us thank you for
[27:47] everything father that you've given unto
[27:49] us and we know you give them freely so
[27:52] then we don't have to work for nothing
[27:53] all we got to do is just relax and let
[27:55] you come on the scene as we try explain
[27:59] this morning about a revelation Lord
[28:01] then there's nothing we can do all we
[28:03] can do is make ourselves available unto
[28:06] you and then that way you can speak to
[28:09] our hearts and lives and Reveal Your
[28:11] word we love you and we thank you and
[28:13] just have your way now show us thy ways
[28:16] that we may walk there in and hold our
[28:18] hands lest we fail you and lead us by
[28:21] thy Grace father we love you and we
[28:23] thank you in Jesus name amen revelation
[28:30] 1 we will never get off of Revelations
[28:33] 1 it gets the point till we finish the
[28:36] Book of Revelations we won't finish
[28:38] Revelations one all right 1 through 3
[28:41] and the Revelation says the revelation
[28:43] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[28:45] to show unto his servants things which
[28:47] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[28:49] and signified it by his Angel unto his
[28:52] servant John who by record of the word
[28:54] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[28:57] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[29:00] he that readeth and they that hear the
[29:02] words of this prophecy and keep those
[29:05] things which are written therein for the
[29:08] time is at hand okay Revelations
[29:14] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[29:16] seal there was silence in heaven about
[29:19] the space of half an hour you may be
[29:22] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[29:25] reading of the word
[29:28] now
[29:29] we've spent quite a time trying to
[29:32] express the things throughout the
[29:35] opening of the seals and the things that
[29:38] we've been uh considering and studying
[29:41] about and I pray that that it's helped
[29:43] you and trying to bring it kind of to a
[29:46] little conclusion into our hearts and
[29:49] lives this morning to talk about you
[29:52] know the silence in heaven and uh like I
[29:56] asked the question what would be the
[29:58] thing that would cause you to stand in
[30:02] all to me when the Plan of
[30:07] Redemption was made known In
[30:10] Heaven There in Revelations
[30:14] 5 by the opening of The Seven
[30:18] Seals then you know that Plan of
[30:21] Redemption to be handed down to
[30:25] Mankind and it would be if if those
[30:28] angels brother R said looking down here
[30:31] and seeing what's
[30:33] transpiring and they have seen these
[30:36] things unfold down through the the uh
[30:41] the word on the Book of
[30:44] Revelations and then they come to a
[30:46] place that they see something well could
[30:49] it be that they're looking down at Earth
[30:52] and seeing upon Earth the things that
[30:54] they have uh have uh you know
[30:58] witnessed and and looked at as far as
[31:01] the doings and the the lamb then coming
[31:04] forth to take the book and and doing
[31:07] those things and saying that he was
[31:09] worthy surely it would cause a an all
[31:13] and you know to happen into those people
[31:16] or those uh angels and cherubims and
[31:20] different things but then when we get
[31:22] back to it we will eventually see that
[31:26] actually that is you and I in chapter
[31:29] five that's right especially there where
[31:31] the Prophet would be dealing with it is
[31:32] always through four and five but he said
[31:35] this is actually the bride in heaven you
[31:37] remember the question they asked him and
[31:39] he answered and said no that's not the
[31:41] bride why because his mind was
[31:43] connecting with Revelations 4:1 going up
[31:46] and different things but then he sees
[31:48] that it is that he answered that
[31:51] question wrong so he went back and said
[31:53] that is the bride see in glory after the
[31:57] right
[31:58] all right then to for you and I it
[32:01] should make us stand today in awe of the
[32:04] thinking of the fact that you and I are
[32:08] the
[32:09] redeemed you and I have been redeemed we
[32:13] have a lamb that has taken the book
[32:16] that's right we've had a prophet to
[32:18] express the things to us to tell us what
[32:21] these things mean and you know the
[32:23] symbols and all and and that way we can
[32:27] understand The Book of Revelations and
[32:29] and see these things
[32:32] unfold where here right I am not much
[32:36] interested in what happening in heaven
[32:39] right I preached a long time ago
[32:42] probably 58 like 10 years ago a series
[32:45] called matching pieces and in that
[32:48] series I was trying to express that when
[32:53] when God SE here on Earth what he had in
[32:56] his mind before the world
[32:58] when we match exactly what he's showing
[33:01] in the Book of
[33:02] Revelations then we're going
[33:05] there I mean it ain't something that we
[33:07] may not or you know maybe we will uh
[33:10] it's made because that's us that's right
[33:13] going to be there there will be a time
[33:15] Revelations 5 will come into a reality
[33:18] amen of you and I being in heaven and
[33:22] all of the things and and when we get on
[33:24] over a little more you'll see the more
[33:26] as it opens up the the uh you know that
[33:29] Jesus when he resurrected sended on high
[33:33] and then he sat down on the father's
[33:34] Throne that's in chapter 5 right he sits
[33:39] down on the father's Throne he becomes
[33:41] the one on the throne he becomes the
[33:43] lamb he becomes the one with the book in
[33:45] his hand he becomes all things to to
[33:48] every bit of it and that'll fulfill the
[33:50] scriptures to where that we can see Amen
[33:53] in other words we're looking at a a a u
[34:00] preview you know but rather said
[34:03] Revelations CH 5 is not a verse by verse
[34:05] expressing but he said it's a scene for
[34:09] the opening of The Seven Seals all right
[34:11] then we see ourselves
[34:14] D already right why shouldn't it give us
[34:18] Rapture in faith you know I mean would
[34:22] you be worried if you could realize and
[34:25] see yourself sitting there as a
[34:29] you know around about the throne and and
[34:31] all of the things that's taking place
[34:33] and all of that represents you and I
[34:35] right and then we would be worried about
[34:37] whether or not we would make it right
[34:40] when we can see ourselves already there
[34:43] that's the beauty to me of the message
[34:46] of the hour that has brought to my
[34:49] understanding anyway is that I can be
[34:52] right here upon Earth in the most
[34:54] horrible existence of time that's ever
[34:57] been as far as perversion and
[34:59] perplexities and everything on every
[35:01] hand but yet at the same time I can look
[35:04] and say it's already
[35:05] finished I can read the back of the
[35:09] book I I know how it's going to end it
[35:13] ain't going to be a surprise to the
[35:14] bride we know how it'll end we know what
[35:18] is causing it to take place and whatever
[35:21] is going on we see that while we he so
[35:26] then that means somebody's going to make
[35:28] amen but the thing of it is it's not my
[35:31] name written there you know what I mean
[35:34] if it just say Samuel D written there
[35:36] you know and just a few you say well
[35:38] that's all it's going to make it no the
[35:41] bride's going to make it so it's not
[35:44] going to be this one name written there
[35:46] or something but we got to see
[35:48] ourselves there before we can go there
[35:51] there's the matching pieces I've tried
[35:53] to get you to see when Martin Luther
[35:56] came on the Earth
[35:58] now we'll get on over into a little more
[36:00] into this and later on in the the the
[36:03] Book of Revelations and studying it you
[36:05] know that those angels coming across
[36:07] there with that with the Everlasting
[36:09] gospel do you know who that
[36:12] was you were looking one of these days
[36:14] and this is I'll give you a key to to
[36:18] studying uh the things I've asked you to
[36:20] read especially say chapter 11 12 and
[36:22] going
[36:23] on you read it it looks like hideous
[36:26] things it look like all kind of animals
[36:28] and all kind of
[36:30] things and
[36:33] it's already taking
[36:36] place or is taking
[36:39] place well I just can't see them them
[36:42] great big hideous animals is coming
[36:44] across the Earth you
[36:45] know and then they get to describ it you
[36:48] know what it is 10th
[36:51] Street downtown Atlanta with a bunch of
[36:54] hippies years
[36:55] ago Bel long hair
[36:59] to torment the women for cutting their
[37:03] High that's what your Prophet said amen
[37:06] right you mean all of these things that
[37:08] we're going to read of could basically
[37:10] almost be fulfilled sir amen the moon
[37:14] turned to blood oh but one of these days
[37:18] it'll be a great
[37:21] this we'll probably get into the
[37:24] trumpets eventually if we can amen you
[37:27] know that WR around said six of those
[37:28] trumpets is already
[37:33] sounding read the trumpets and look at
[37:36] the horrible things that are under
[37:38] there and he said it's already taking
[37:41] place we see we're looking for something
[37:43] to
[37:44] happen when it's already finished amen
[37:47] that will be what we'll be trying to get
[37:49] to when we get off of this part
[37:51] here but now remember what we were
[37:54] saying this morning
[37:56] then the
[38:01] violence those people are actually or
[38:04] that situation is taking place to look
[38:06] down
[38:07] here but down
[38:10] here is the most important thing of
[38:15] all right because without this here
[38:18] there would not be that there right now
[38:21] don't try to turn it around cuz see
[38:23] you're going to try to turn it around
[38:25] and say it backwards you're going to say
[38:27] well that that D there wouldn't be this
[38:31] here you're going backwards that's right
[38:34] you'll never get nowhere going that
[38:36] way without this is happening on Earth
[38:39] there would never be that
[38:41] there so then we better depend upon
[38:44] what's here where does the Thunder s at
[38:47] on Earth the prophet said
[38:50] right watch it when we get over to the
[38:52] end of the message today and see how
[38:55] that the Lord himself descends from
[38:56] heaven with the sh right and we realize
[39:00] things is taking place
[39:03] yes right and see then through the
[39:07] opening of the seals and the things
[39:08] that's what I want you to think about
[39:10] this afternoon if I don't get nothing
[39:11] else
[39:12] across
[39:15] is the things that will be that we'll
[39:18] deal
[39:20] with that when the prophet saw
[39:23] it it had already happened in his
[39:26] ministry
[39:27] right
[39:28] amen he was no longer looking forward MH
[39:33] he was looking at right what was
[39:37] transpiring all right now there may be
[39:40] things that will transpire one day but
[39:43] still the basics of let's just get down
[39:45] to seeing what God has done and then by
[39:48] way of the
[39:50] Prophet
[39:52] remember there would be no need of him
[39:55] right I hope the Lord forgives me for
[39:57] this terminology cuz I'm caral this get
[40:00] to be anyway but there'd be no need of
[40:02] having a prophet if it wasn't a bride
[40:06] right absolutely this wouldn't be any
[40:09] need of it it wouldn't be need of a
[40:12] bride if it wasn't
[40:14] savior
[40:16] amen so it's all comes back to you and I
[40:21] the Book of Revelations is not something
[40:23] that shows great big old V that's what
[40:25] we talk boom boom boom something walking
[40:28] across the Earth you know my
[40:30] brother-in-law told me that the badst
[40:32] preacher you know he said oh they'll
[40:33] just be a great big animal I said Robert
[40:36] my Lord's got to be a religious matter
[40:39] you can't deceive nobody with a King
[40:43] Kong a great big whale washed up down
[40:46] there on the beach one day and I told my
[40:48] wife I said gu Roberts Glory Hallelujah
[40:50] he found the animal that come washing up
[40:52] out the ocean you know and all that I
[40:55] said I'm not throwing off
[40:57] we everyone was in that shake and still
[40:59] are until God does something for us you
[41:02] know we've all had our ideas and
[41:04] opinions and thoughts that's right but
[41:07] think about
[41:10] it the silence in
[41:13] heaven now get this for the message part
[41:17] A little later on I mentioned it this
[41:21] morning silence in heaven for space half
[41:25] hour all right now brother Brown
[41:28] you're going to tell us you're a
[41:29] revelation of
[41:32] it yes that's what I'm going to do I'm
[41:35] not going to
[41:36] speak I can't speak you know that even
[41:41] balum said there is no way I can say
[41:43] anything that's
[41:46] right unless God speaks to me first
[41:50] that's right a false prophet couldn't
[41:54] speak until God spoke
[41:58] that's what he
[42:00] said but you see a great silence in
[42:04] heaven okay now where you going brother
[42:07] Brandon to get a
[42:10] scripture he covers chapter 7 he said
[42:14] this is all we have to go on
[42:17] right well that was what I was saying
[42:19] this morning to get your thought in mind
[42:21] see cuz chapter 7 starts over telling
[42:23] you what happens under chapter 6
[42:29] mhm chapter 8 chapter 9 chapter 10 tells
[42:32] you what happens under chapter
[42:35] 6 that's the scriptures the prophet was
[42:39] using the only thing he had to go on was
[42:42] the complete Plan of
[42:46] Redemption that would be completed
[42:48] through those two
[42:51] witnesses upon this
[42:54] Earth that will bring a situation into
[42:57] existence of
[42:59] purging until it'll even start a purging
[43:01] of the
[43:03] world and bringing that into a situation
[43:06] to where it will eventually turn out to
[43:08] have a future home right situation right
[43:14] amen and it go right into
[43:17] eternity I hope you were listening I
[43:19] want to rephrase
[43:21] it when God speaks to Your Heart by
[43:25] Revelation that is he eternal
[43:29] life when he spoke to you about one God
[43:32] water baptism no eternal hell a prophet
[43:34] sin
[43:36] Etc that Split Second that it was
[43:41] there is eternal life that's right right
[43:46] then you drop back to Earth and you
[43:47] start searching the things of the word
[43:50] right to see where everything is
[43:53] at when the prophet comes over and he
[43:55] says Lord what are we going to do it
[43:58] just says a silence
[44:05] yes
[44:09] silence and God opens the word yes and
[44:13] what would you be looking for if you
[44:15] were looking for silence in the
[44:18] word as we'll get to some of the dreams
[44:20] and the things that the prophet spoke of
[44:23] when he said see it slide right into the
[44:25] scriptures
[44:27] because he couldn't take anything that
[44:29] wasn't in the
[44:32] scriptures this is not that it's all
[44:34] made you
[44:35] know and then wind up to be something
[44:38] different or some some doings you know
[44:41] that's right it's to be the word
[44:45] amen God is to reveal himself to us
[44:48] through the word he was a word
[44:52] Prophet so when he did he knows
[44:55] immediately because of what's been going
[44:57] on during the week that's right he said
[45:00] it's not been a man said it's been the
[45:03] angels of the
[45:04] Lord amen you remember the Visions the
[45:08] dreams the different things that
[45:09] happened that he was to go to
[45:12] Tucson you know be found at a certain
[45:15] place and God would open up that those
[45:18] things to him he meet with the angels of
[45:21] the
[45:22] Lord he said this day this scripture is
[45:25] fulfilled he had met with those angels
[45:28] come forth that's right brought the
[45:30] message
[45:31] amen
[45:33] well he knew what was going on that week
[45:35] he said I wanted somebody to stand up
[45:38] and see it and say I see what's going on
[45:42] we get to it the minute of the great
[45:44] third pull he says this is that third
[45:46] pull he said you should have caught it
[45:48] the other day that's
[45:49] right
[45:52] well let's get into the things then and
[45:55] try to follow it by what of the Prophet
[45:57] because that's the only way we can
[46:01] go so when brother R sees silence in
[46:04] heaven he immediately reads yourself up
[46:07] he immediately dropped
[46:08] over so this is my revelation of it he
[46:13] said it's some seven Thunders that's
[46:15] right that John was forbidden to Rite
[46:19] well you know being forbidden to write
[46:20] would be a
[46:21] Sol now he's got scripture right Amen to
[46:26] go with the
[46:31] point oh a silence in
[46:35] heaven he's got a background of
[46:37] everything in chapter 7 cuz that's what
[46:39] he said this this is just a background
[46:41] for it what to show the complete Plan of
[46:46] Redemption so then he's going over and
[46:49] he's saying she look those things which
[46:51] the seven Thunders utter right them not
[46:53] but in the days of the voice of the
[46:56] seven
[46:57] Angel when he the seventh Church age
[47:00] Messenger right John knows now
[47:03] Revelations 10 he knows now that he that
[47:06] he can see he's wondering how in the
[47:08] world I'm I'm commissioned to write all
[47:10] of this that's right I'm commissioned to
[47:11] tell you all of these things but how in
[47:14] the world am I going to get it back to
[47:16] down to people on Earth
[47:19] that's he knew that he could write the
[47:21] book yes but he knew better than to
[47:25] think that he would be able to live
[47:27] 2,000
[47:28] years and delivering himself that's
[47:32] right you so he says what will I
[47:37] do that little butt is very beautiful
[47:41] there in in Revelations 10:7 you know
[47:44] how many times I've tried best to
[47:46] explain that to you he said but in the
[47:48] days of the voice and you right then
[47:50] that that seventh Church age messenger
[47:52] was a prophet right he saw it right
[47:55] there that that would be he brother
[47:57] around says Revelations
[47:59] 10:1 the angel standing with the rainbow
[48:02] about him he said is the same as
[48:05] Revelation
[48:07] 113 one in the midst of the seven golden
[48:09] candles stick like un the son of man G
[48:11] about the pouch with a golden girdle
[48:13] amen and he knows it's going to be on
[48:16] earth so he says all right now we've got
[48:19] it John said I know how to get it back
[48:23] all I got to do is just keep writing
[48:27] I don't have to go deliver it right I
[48:30] just keep writing cuz now the key has
[48:33] come for it that that seventh Church age
[48:37] messenger would be a
[48:40] prophet I don't spend my time trying to
[48:42] proved run around was a prophet God
[48:44] proved that I spend my time trying to
[48:47] get you to see where he's at in the
[48:50] word he had that that that biblical
[48:54] background he had he everything he had
[48:57] he laid it in the word amen he said if
[48:59] that angel tells me something that's not
[49:01] in the word he said I ain't going to
[49:02] take
[49:06] it because he's he was a prophet
[49:10] right if that angel didn't tell him the
[49:12] truth he said not the angel of the
[49:17] Lord but see then that seventh angel
[49:19] would be able to deliver Jo this going
[49:21] I'll finish writing the book
[49:25] now my word worries about getting it
[49:29] down because I want to TI a little point
[49:31] to you and let you
[49:33] think see in chapter 5 as we were
[49:36] studying this
[49:38] morning
[49:40] John is
[49:45] worried because it was nobody to take
[49:47] the
[49:53] book he rejoiced when he saw the lamb
[49:58] what do you think he done when he saw
[49:59] this angel in
[50:03] 107 what do you think John Da when he
[50:05] looks down and
[50:07] sees but there will be one on Earth that
[50:11] can bring this Revelation at the
[50:15] time clearly he's
[50:18] rejoicing to see those
[50:21] things now so then we're looking at it
[50:25] and seeing that what
[50:29] we have the ability now to hear from God
[50:33] yes that was part I had in the notes
[50:36] this morning the brothers know it I
[50:37] didn't bring it
[50:40] out cuz to me the Thunder the voice of
[50:43] God when the seal breaks amen right
[50:45] that's what your Prophet said it was I'm
[50:48] give you these over and over and over to
[50:50] where you can
[50:52] do paragraph 262 the first seal Thunders
[50:55] the voice of God when the seal
[51:01] broke but I'm asking you one
[51:06] question do we hear a voice from
[51:10] Heaven no are you listening yes or do we
[51:14] hear the voice of God from Heaven
[51:17] speaking by way of a prophet on
[51:20] Earth
[51:23] right now which one is it
[51:27] do we need to go to heaven to get
[51:32] this or do we need to just keep studying
[51:36] the message that's
[51:38] it because we're going to believe that
[51:40] this was the light Angel's message then
[51:43] we're going to have to believe to the
[51:45] Gentiles now put it correctly right cuz
[51:48] two prophets go to Israel that's right
[51:50] but to the Gentiles there's not another
[51:52] Prophet to come to bring us something we
[51:55] must depend upon what we already have
[51:58] well if we're dependent upon what we
[52:00] already have why is everybody looking
[52:03] for something
[52:05] else that's all I've ever asked any
[52:09] question I'm not don't throw off on
[52:11] these people for do it I've always
[52:14] said I'd rather see a man stumble and
[52:18] fall at least trying then to see the
[52:21] people is we don't we don't need to know
[52:24] them deep things we might get get
[52:27] confused so we just stay real simple now
[52:31] so we'll just do that and we'll just get
[52:33] together and we'll just play the tapes
[52:36] and that way we're hearing exactly the
[52:39] voice of
[52:43] God you know that's what's going to kill
[52:45] us right right amen yep you realize that
[52:50] people that are hearing this message is
[52:53] going to be life or death to you and I
[52:56] right amen Y is that true amen right
[53:00] it's going there's no gray areas in that
[53:02] PL right we're either going to have to
[53:05] take what he said that's right and I
[53:08] spent my biggest portion of my Ministry
[53:10] defining to show you know brother Ray
[53:14] and I were talking this morning about
[53:15] brother Brandon probably say about 20
[53:17] times he's going to get a new
[53:19] body
[53:23] sure then he turns around and he says
[53:26] well now
[53:27] it's not another body it's this body
[53:29] redeemed that's
[53:31] right cuz what goes down comes up
[53:36] right well just put those two together
[53:38] and you got it right amen this old body
[53:41] if it goes to the Grave it's coming back
[53:43] up brand
[53:47] new Trump going to get a new body but
[53:51] not another
[53:52] body this body is going to be made new
[53:56] amen now we got it right but I'm just
[54:00] going to take this
[54:04] quote you name me any Doctrine and by
[54:07] memory I can probably tell you two or
[54:09] three quotes it'll sound totally
[54:12] contrary but you give me any Scripture
[54:15] and I'll give you some scriptures that
[54:16] sound the contrary
[54:19] right right but you see we believe it's
[54:21] the word of God Amen for God to speak to
[54:25] you and I that way confounds the wise
[54:27] and
[54:29] Prudence it just they just get all
[54:31] dangled up in it and they can't figure
[54:33] it out cuz that's what it was in the
[54:37] Bible they were looking for him to come
[54:39] down there a great rid and Shining
[54:41] Prince great you know boy he's coming
[54:43] down he's going to roll that carpet
[54:45] right out to cisus of course that always
[54:48] had you know somebody involved you know
[54:51] it's always when people you watch
[54:53] somebody I got something going tell you
[54:55] nobody else don't know it
[54:57] I'm going to tell you this you just
[55:00] watch it you might not get it in that
[55:02] first service but the second one you
[55:04] going to get to find out that they're
[55:05] talking about
[55:07] theirself if you're smart enough you get
[55:09] it in the first one yeah if you don't
[55:12] listen to it three times you'll find out
[55:14] they talking about yourself
[55:16] right that's right I'll tell you when it
[55:19] comes you know what kind of a doctrine
[55:21] that is or an
[55:24] idea I've never told you this is my idea
[55:27] I tell you what I believe the prophet
[55:30] said if I have told you it's my idea I
[55:33] always tell you it's my idea no
[55:36] problem I just put it blind and blunt
[55:38] and then go on that way but now listen
[55:40] all
[55:41] right the prophet of God as we were
[55:44] talking this morning he says we feel
[55:46] that we've heard His Voice already in
[55:50] the opening of these seals yes that's
[55:53] paragraph one of the seventh seal
[55:58] he said with feel we've heard his
[56:02] voice speaking to
[56:06] us he said I already heard
[56:09] it what about looking for a
[56:12] voice when you're hearing the
[56:15] voice right is that something that's
[56:19] right if the Lord would just speak to
[56:24] me I I thought thought we believe that
[56:28] the prophet of God was the voice of God
[56:30] Amen I mean I thought that's what we had
[56:32] the understanding of you know then if
[56:37] he's a prophet then he's God's
[56:39] mouthpiece that's it to speak that even
[56:42] as it said a moment ago even a false
[56:44] prophet can't say something contrary to
[56:47] what God tells
[56:49] him you know it's in the Bible about b b
[56:53] right I don't mean it's in how bad is
[56:55] you know the prophets what is prophesied
[56:57] of the second coming or something like
[56:58] that it's in the scripture where he's
[57:00] prophesying
[57:04] right cuz he can't do it he can't be
[57:06] anything other than what that's what he
[57:08] told
[57:09] bam B I can't curse he'd open his mouth
[57:13] get ready to curse and he looked down
[57:15] and he said I see
[57:17] nothing he said come around here behind
[57:19] look this bad part about him he'd say
[57:22] they're the apple of my eye that's right
[57:24] right he just go to bless them like
[57:28] everything the only thing he was capable
[57:30] of doing is he figured out enough how to
[57:31] get them to right follow after the wrong
[57:34] thing but now
[57:36] listen so the voice of
[57:40] God why would we be looking for a voice
[57:44] of
[57:45] God when we have the magnetic
[57:49] tapes you know the things that has
[57:53] captured actually The Voice
[57:56] and we we had people that had ways I
[57:58] remember a man down here in Georgia one
[58:00] time said like this he said you you
[58:03] can't understand what brother Brown said
[58:05] if you standing there seeing his hands
[58:07] moving and and what he was pointing at
[58:09] and what he was doing and I never didn't
[58:12] know the voice of God had to do anything
[58:14] like that you
[58:16] know I always thought that it was to be
[58:20] now I'm honest I thought it was to be an
[58:23] inward voice right
[58:27] the prophet is an outward uh mouthpiece
[58:31] right that's right of God okay but you
[58:34] know still after him saying
[58:38] that if God doesn't speak to your heart
[58:41] to my heart Amen brother we don't know
[58:43] what he's
[58:46] saying right that's
[58:49] simple hear his voice I don't get do it
[58:53] I've got the scripture written the Bible
[58:54] said in this day here his voice not like
[58:57] it did in the days of
[58:59] pation
[59:01] right you notice the children of Israel
[59:03] heard the very voice of God yes sir
[59:06] amen
[59:08] Y and they send away their day of
[59:12] Grace and they
[59:16] said don't let God
[59:19] speak unless we die
[59:26] and then you ly people don't like the
[59:30] idea of some preacher talking about
[59:33] something God gave to him yeah to give
[59:36] to them
[59:38] y I can get it
[59:42] myself well why didn't you get it
[59:44] yourself to start
[59:46] with
[59:51] amen now don't try to make a job
[59:56] I didn't say what God told me in his
[1:00:00] word I said what he told me is written
[1:00:03] in his word
[1:00:06] that that we watch after your
[1:00:10] soul that you got to have a five-fold
[1:00:13] Ministry and the people this message
[1:00:15] don't like that that's right I didn't
[1:00:17] write it in the
[1:00:19] book amen a have anything to do with it
[1:00:22] right p with Paul about
[1:00:24] it that's right how can they hear
[1:00:27] without a preacher bless God I get it
[1:00:31] myself you bu your women
[1:00:35] preachers yeah
[1:00:39] right you know I get down there and I
[1:00:41] get hard don't
[1:00:46] I you know a preacher is supposed to be
[1:00:50] a man we know the women got their own
[1:00:53] little pull pits and you take care of
[1:00:55] those things and you each other we got
[1:00:56] it all laid in the right order we know
[1:00:58] all about it that's right you raise your
[1:01:00] families you do the thing
[1:01:02] right but God set a fivefold
[1:01:06] ministry that's right for the perfecting
[1:01:08] of the
[1:01:10] Saints and you got to depend on that if
[1:01:12] you're
[1:01:13] going well you mean I got a have five
[1:01:15] for minutes I didn't say it your Prophet
[1:01:19] said
[1:01:21] it well now you got a bunch of preachers
[1:01:24] out here that don't fit in that category
[1:01:26] because they're teaching things contrary
[1:01:30] well I know I have a carnal way of
[1:01:32] explaining things very
[1:01:35] carnal but a lot of times gets point
[1:01:37] across amen you know that the preacher
[1:01:40] is not preaching the correct truth of
[1:01:41] the word of God whether it be me you or
[1:01:43] who it is that we're a bunch of women
[1:01:49] preachers that's right well can I get
[1:01:51] that face on there enough to make it
[1:01:54] that's right and you know if you ain't
[1:01:56] careful we can wind up being a bunch of
[1:01:58] perverts
[1:02:01] y
[1:02:03] right now that's rough but that's what
[1:02:05] the Bible has to say I didn't write the
[1:02:10] book much of women
[1:02:13] preachers that look like men standing in
[1:02:16] the pullit preaching amen and saying
[1:02:19] this is what the Lord told me and
[1:02:20] everybody Glory Hallelujah they just
[1:02:22] running and just shouting all over did
[1:02:24] you hear what brother someone so saying
[1:02:27] I don't give up what he say if it ain't
[1:02:30] a right according to the word right now
[1:02:33] when it's right according to the word I
[1:02:35] holler amen that's right cuz I've heard
[1:02:37] from
[1:02:39] God that's right but you see I
[1:02:44] know but I thought the bride was to be
[1:02:47] the final voice of the final age under
[1:02:50] her Messenger
[1:02:53] right so I thought then to lay it would
[1:02:56] have something to do with this thing
[1:02:58] that's
[1:02:59] right that they would receive the voice
[1:03:01] of
[1:03:08] God
[1:03:10] right if you have trouble hearing the
[1:03:12] voice of God through a
[1:03:15] man then you would have had trouble
[1:03:18] talking to run around right that's right
[1:03:21] and listening to him because you
[1:03:24] do all right
[1:03:26] so if the Thunder is the voice of God
[1:03:29] and only the prophet knew what those
[1:03:31] Thunders
[1:03:33] were then he makes a statement one day
[1:03:36] that's easy for you lity to take and
[1:03:40] apply he said if somebody thinks they
[1:03:43] got those seven
[1:03:44] Thunders and it don't compare with the
[1:03:47] rest of the
[1:03:49] word said get away from them that's
[1:03:52] right amen that's simple amen
[1:03:56] that's
[1:04:00] simple so the Thunder is the voice of
[1:04:04] God because God
[1:04:07] promised Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation
[1:04:11] 10:7 the many scriptures that he
[1:04:13] promised
[1:04:17] us and he promised us that this
[1:04:21] messenger
[1:04:22] would come and he would
[1:04:28] do two things he turn the hearts of the
[1:04:31] children back to the Fai of the fathers
[1:04:33] and then the he reveal the seven
[1:04:35] Thunders which is a revelation
[1:04:37] containing the Seven Seals and it be
[1:04:39] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:04:41] that literally turn our hearts back so
[1:04:43] you know what we're not waiting I I when
[1:04:46] I saw brother randam to be a prophet I
[1:04:50] quit everybody stay wait with me and
[1:04:52] listen to this problem I quit trying to
[1:04:55] hear from heaven
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:01] right we all as human beings would sure
[1:05:05] love to hear voices out of heaven
[1:05:08] right you
[1:05:10] know but it might be like that fell was
[1:05:13] is going down the road and his buddy was
[1:05:14] going to pull a trick on him so climbed
[1:05:16] up in a tree and he
[1:05:17] said he went by and he said
[1:05:21] John we got stop and look
[1:05:23] all said John
[1:05:27] he said you called a
[1:05:30] preach 40 something years later the guy
[1:05:33] that was up in the tree said what in the
[1:05:34] world can I tell him he's been preaching
[1:05:36] 40
[1:05:37] years over my
[1:05:40] call but you see you can hear a lot of
[1:05:43] voices right true but if those voices
[1:05:47] don't speak according to the word of God
[1:05:49] what good AR
[1:05:52] they sounds beautiful oh but brother
[1:05:55] Dale you everybody's got a right to to
[1:05:57] who we want to listen to I haven't said
[1:06:00] a word about it what are you
[1:06:07] fussing but
[1:06:09] listen brother Brown
[1:06:13] says page 75 which is in the first seal
[1:06:16] paragraph 75 I'm not asking to pull
[1:06:18] these up I'm just quoting on lot this
[1:06:20] afternoon save time I'll get one in a
[1:06:24] minute and I I'll say pull up in at B of
[1:06:26] time
[1:06:29] okay he said through these seven
[1:06:31] Thunders will bring the church to
[1:06:34] Rapture and
[1:06:37] Faith well if it's through the
[1:06:41] Thunders then we need to know what they
[1:06:43] are if we're going to have Rapture and
[1:06:44] Faith simple logic
[1:06:47] right well I just don't believe we need
[1:06:50] to know what the Thunder say well you
[1:06:52] don't want Rapture in fith that's right
[1:06:54] right that's right I I didn't say this
[1:06:56] quote the prophet did you want us to
[1:06:58] pull up on the screen to read
[1:07:04] it he said paragraph
[1:07:08] 35 of the fourth
[1:07:10] seal said at the time of the seven
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:15] Thunders we find Christ of Revelations
[1:07:21] 10 I guess it pull it down
[1:07:29] and at the time of those seven Thunders
[1:07:31] we find Christ are the angel come down
[1:07:33] with a rainbow and put his feet on the
[1:07:35] land and sea and swore by him that time
[1:07:39] had run
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:45] out what is the thunder it's the voice
[1:07:48] of
[1:07:49] God speaking to you and I paragraph 146
[1:07:52] of the first Feld
[1:07:55] paragraph
[1:07:57] 262 I think it's on the six first seal
[1:08:01] the voice of God when the seal
[1:08:05] opened the Thunder is the voice of God
[1:08:07] when the seal
[1:08:09] opened giving us his Revelation then we
[1:08:13] have
[1:08:14] heard by the opening of the
[1:08:17] word the voice of
[1:08:19] God now can you put your life on
[1:08:22] that you got to put it on something what
[1:08:25] is that saying if you won't stand for
[1:08:26] something you'll fall for nothing some
[1:08:28] way like that I don't remember
[1:08:30] exactly you'll fall for anything you
[1:08:32] stand for something that's right that's
[1:08:35] right so my stand has always been on one
[1:08:37] thing that we must depend upon what the
[1:08:39] prophet had to say Amen cuz only by that
[1:08:43] would we
[1:08:45] know the Thunders the the
[1:08:50] message and for him to come and be the
[1:08:53] voice of God would be the promise say
[1:08:55] God made to you and I Malachi 4 Luke
[1:08:58] 17:30 Revelations
[1:09:02] 10:7 see but that's not all the
[1:09:04] scriptures we use those scriptures as
[1:09:08] relating to its Ministry is the
[1:09:12] thing but do we really truly mean
[1:09:16] that to
[1:09:18] say the
[1:09:22] prophet and we could say that he's the
[1:09:25] mouth peace of
[1:09:30] God can we truly believe that yes
[1:09:35] right well if I have just been back
[1:09:38] there
[1:09:41] well let's see if I
[1:09:44] can quote a little bit from
[1:09:49] memory he said that picture that was
[1:09:53] taken
[1:09:55] of the Angel of the
[1:09:58] Lord was
[1:10:02] greater than for you to stand the
[1:10:04] presence of
[1:10:07] God I'm paraphrasing that so don't worry
[1:10:10] about it but it's
[1:10:13] close he said because the scientific
[1:10:16] camera of you know the eye of the camera
[1:10:18] cannot take
[1:10:22] psychology and said for you to be able
[1:10:25] to see that is more real than right
[1:10:28] anything you could
[1:10:33] comprehend the world has it up in the
[1:10:36] religious Hall of Arts but where they
[1:10:38] got it stuffed in the
[1:10:40] basement because of the one caption that
[1:10:42] is under it that says the only
[1:10:44] supernatural being that was ever
[1:10:46] photographed right you I was thinking
[1:10:48] about that the other day I wondered and
[1:10:50] I'm sure about me saying it to devil
[1:10:52] going to jump on it and run up somebody
[1:10:53] up there I figured by now they would
[1:10:55] have had that picture took
[1:10:58] apart I figured by now the religious
[1:11:00] people would have had that picture took
[1:11:02] apart and they would have rewrote the
[1:11:04] books about it and they would have
[1:11:06] proved according to their scientific
[1:11:11] knowledge that that was a wrong
[1:11:15] photograph but they haven't done it so
[1:11:17] far right right I guess that'll open up
[1:11:19] the canab beans where the devil will run
[1:11:21] up there and start doing it that's all
[1:11:22] right cuz anytime he starts fighting
[1:11:25] just remember you're going to find
[1:11:26] something
[1:11:29] good I love to get him stirred up
[1:11:31] because I know that I got him stirred up
[1:11:33] and I get him stirred up things are
[1:11:34] going to happen right right you
[1:11:37] know but now
[1:11:40] listen the voice of God speaking to you
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:44] I the mouthpiece of
[1:11:48] God the children of
[1:11:51] Israel had the opportunity I come right
[1:11:54] up to it this morning back away knowing
[1:11:56] i' be here with doing this the children
[1:11:59] of Israel had the opportunity to hear
[1:12:05] yesen and they said don't let God
[1:12:11] speak Les we
[1:12:14] die I've always said you know Moses had
[1:12:17] a burning bush well when the children of
[1:12:20] Israel come back out to the mountain out
[1:12:21] there everybody had a bush
[1:12:25] right right the whole Mountain was on
[1:12:27] fire
[1:12:31] amen they said Moses you go up there and
[1:12:34] you get it and and you come back
[1:12:39] yeah that was never to been God's way of
[1:12:42] doing things that's right he wanted to
[1:12:44] speak to every one of them
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:50] amen but instead of being able to speak
[1:12:52] to every one of them he had to say
[1:12:56] okay that's what you
[1:13:00] want course none of us was back there
[1:13:03] and so none of us would fit in this
[1:13:05] category I
[1:13:10] hope right so what do we say
[1:13:15] now what does everybody say
[1:13:18] now see then they said let not God
[1:13:21] speak Moses you go get it and come and
[1:13:24] tell us
[1:13:25] now they say don't let man speak we're
[1:13:27] going straight to
[1:13:30] God but too
[1:13:32] late
[1:13:34] right cuz it ain't going to work am
[1:13:37] right why because you chose it but
[1:13:41] brother hell I wasn't
[1:13:44] there I didn't choose that what are you
[1:13:47] choosing now
[1:13:49] right yeah come on
[1:13:57] I put in a little bit this morning about
[1:13:59] the million dollars and telling you you
[1:14:01] need to come back this evening and give
[1:14:03] away your million cuz you might get
[1:14:05] something
[1:14:06] else well a lot of people don't want to
[1:14:10] come
[1:14:12] back they want to keep their
[1:14:19] million dirty old guy
[1:14:22] Ain but is that the truth true
[1:14:29] amen do I speak with forking
[1:14:33] tongue
[1:14:35] no all
[1:14:39] right see church if we've heard the
[1:14:42] voice of God why are we looking for the
[1:14:43] voice of God right
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] amen I know I'm accused of being a real
[1:14:50] old deep preacher and boy that's deep I
[1:14:52] mean right you know these little kids
[1:14:54] here they tell you exactly what I just
[1:14:58] said that's that's deep now what it
[1:15:02] means is you don't want to agree with
[1:15:06] it that's
[1:15:08] right you want the voice of God but
[1:15:11] you're running all over the country
[1:15:12] trying to find a voice of
[1:15:15] God that's why you got so much Church
[1:15:17] hopping y that's true these people
[1:15:20] running from church to church and trying
[1:15:22] to find the voice of
[1:15:23] God what are you hiding for amen that's
[1:15:30] right to jump in churches you'd be
[1:15:32] better off stay home listen to
[1:15:38] t you say yeah but you just said want to
[1:15:41] go to that I'll agree that's not right
[1:15:43] but I'm just saying it like it
[1:15:46] is see
[1:15:49] Church we're looking for something that
[1:15:52] we already have that's right amen right
[1:15:55] that's correct sir they always said you
[1:15:58] go out in the football field you know
[1:16:00] that's why the Bible says you stumble a
[1:16:02] stumbling Stone and my best way of
[1:16:04] definition of that is you go out in the
[1:16:06] football field you know it's supposed to
[1:16:07] be all cut green grass you know smooth
[1:16:10] nothing out there few lines and you
[1:16:13] little
[1:16:14] bit and right out in the middle of that
[1:16:16] football field is
[1:16:19] a a football you know a rock that big
[1:16:24] and you just looking all over the place
[1:16:27] and you just stumble all over that
[1:16:30] rock who put that there
[1:16:34] y they what do you mean that was what I
[1:16:38] was looking
[1:16:39] for that's what it means is you stumble
[1:16:42] at The Stumbling
[1:16:43] Stone you're looking for it all over it
[1:16:48] can't see it
[1:16:51] amen this message is a headstone to the
[1:16:54] of Jesus Christ why you looking for a
[1:16:57] headstone to
[1:17:01] come boy one of these day that headstone
[1:17:03] going to come out of Heaven
[1:17:08] work that's what we're going to get down
[1:17:10] to find out try to prove it by the
[1:17:14] natural to show you finding out a lot of
[1:17:16] these things is already taken place and
[1:17:18] we're looking for them to
[1:17:22] happen your prophet of God had no
[1:17:24] problem with saying he is
[1:17:28] here I'm not looking for his
[1:17:32] coming I'm saying he's here he
[1:17:38] noou well God listen and I hope you
[1:17:41] understand this a God in heaven will do
[1:17:43] you no good on earth
[1:17:46] right we had that in a denominations Our
[1:17:50] God was up in heaven somewhere else no
[1:17:52] personality down here with us
[1:17:56] yes but one of these days we're going to
[1:17:58] get up our worries
[1:18:02] at like I've always
[1:18:04] said man has spent 6,000 years trying to
[1:18:08] prove there's a God in heaven and God
[1:18:10] has spent 6,000 years trying to prove
[1:18:12] he's down on
[1:18:15] Earth you know that brother randam did
[1:18:17] say the reason they was silence in
[1:18:18] heaven you know what he said the reason
[1:18:20] there was silence in heaven how many
[1:18:22] remember the quote amen he said cuz
[1:18:24] nothing up that's
[1:18:27] right that's what he
[1:18:29] said be glad to find it already
[1:18:32] somewhere in here let's see I might even
[1:18:34] be able to find it right
[1:18:37] now hang on a
[1:18:41] second paragraph 348 of the sardian
[1:18:45] church age which would be 348 Church age
[1:18:47] book he said the reason the silence in
[1:18:49] heaven God is empty
[1:18:52] y that's right that's
[1:18:56] yes listen
[1:18:59] Church what are we looking
[1:19:07] for have we ever realized yet pull up
[1:19:10] number nine
[1:19:12] brother
[1:19:16] Jo have you ever realized these
[1:19:22] scriptures but this we say unto you you
[1:19:24] by the word of the Lord that we which
[1:19:26] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:19:27] the Lord shall not prevent hinder in
[1:19:31] other words them which are
[1:19:35] asleep why is it that we can't
[1:19:39] hinder why is it that they can't be
[1:19:41] hindered well you say they're asleep no
[1:19:45] the far means you're going to explain it
[1:19:48] righten okay I'm not a good English
[1:19:50] major but I I got a little sense
[1:19:54] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:19:57] heaven with a shout amen with the voice
[1:20:01] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:20:03] God and the dead and Christ shall rise
[1:20:06] first for the Lord himself amen shall
[1:20:10] descend from
[1:20:11] heaven with a
[1:20:14] shout now we had that all figured out
[1:20:17] didn't we one of these
[1:20:20] days there's going to be in the Eastern
[1:20:23] sky
[1:20:25] a great thing that's going to
[1:20:27] happen and we're going to hear a voice
[1:20:30] somebody that holler
[1:20:36] hey a big
[1:20:41] sh and the
[1:20:44] Lord is going to descend out of that
[1:20:46] Eastern
[1:20:48] sky right down to where we
[1:20:51] are like I said this morning that's what
[1:20:54] confus didn't like cuz they had that
[1:20:56] figured out see they had it all figured
[1:20:59] out that Jesus's first coming was going
[1:21:02] to be and he's going to come down he's
[1:21:03] going to roll the carpet right up to
[1:21:06] cus and he's going to walk up there and
[1:21:08] he say oh cus you've been a great ruler
[1:21:12] of my people and I've come to
[1:21:16] you well that wasn't exactly the way it
[1:21:20] happened right you
[1:21:23] know yeah he had the
[1:21:26] opportunity to be able to receive it
[1:21:29] right but because of the way that it
[1:21:31] came he didn't receive
[1:21:34] it you think you can convince the
[1:21:38] world that this message this Prophet has
[1:21:42] brought is the voice of
[1:21:47] God go try yeah that's right just get
[1:21:50] talking to somebody and say folks you
[1:21:52] know there's a voice of God you know if
[1:21:54] you you don't like brother Tom now I'm
[1:21:56] not thr off on him but brother Tom would
[1:21:57] do
[1:21:58] it your church ain't preaching the Seven
[1:22:03] Seals and you're out that's the way Tom
[1:22:07] talk they let me write it down for you
[1:22:10] you always kept a pad in a pencil I
[1:22:13] write these scriptures
[1:22:15] down I kept telling him Tom you can't do
[1:22:19] that but you see he he was glad to say
[1:22:23] them things sure right if your pastor
[1:22:25] ain't preaching the seals you need to
[1:22:27] get you another Pastor you know
[1:22:32] but all
[1:22:34] right can do you think you can convince
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:37] world that we believe the Lord
[1:22:42] descended from Heaven that's right in
[1:22:45] this message y
[1:22:47] right do we really believe that that's
[1:22:50] right or is it a good quote Yeah
[1:22:53] remember
[1:22:57] well Robert University can say
[1:23:01] that they got the
[1:23:04] tape what he brother around say he said
[1:23:07] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:23:08] heaven with a shout and the shout is
[1:23:10] this
[1:23:11] message now you think they going to
[1:23:13] believe
[1:23:17] that well why is everybody in this
[1:23:19] message still looking for some way or
[1:23:22] somebody
[1:23:25] why is it when these young guys come up
[1:23:27] you know these new ones come on the
[1:23:29] field that everybody runs to them and
[1:23:33] just like glue they'll just run right to
[1:23:35] them and they'll just sit down there and
[1:23:37] they boy they'll just oh man a something
[1:23:39] this is the one we waited don't this is
[1:23:41] the one this is him this is him we we
[1:23:43] waited on this one right
[1:23:46] here and then after a while you see it
[1:23:49] just ding
[1:23:51] down just fade away and that's right
[1:23:55] they run over to another one this is it
[1:23:57] that that wasn't it but this is it well
[1:24:00] after a while I'd get down to find out
[1:24:01] who's what that's
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:06] right
[1:24:08] amen he said Brother D you sound like
[1:24:11] you're saying that you don't want people
[1:24:12] to come to this church I don't want
[1:24:14] nobody to come to this church that don't
[1:24:15] want the
[1:24:17] word is that blown enough amen that's
[1:24:20] right you say you mean you don't want me
[1:24:22] here if you don't want to words you're
[1:24:24] hindering me and I'm hindering you go
[1:24:27] somewhere that God can speak to your
[1:24:29] heart cuz we don't have a lot of time
[1:24:33] left to realize that by
[1:24:36] now that's right and that way I'm not
[1:24:39] trying to run nobody off I wouldn't be
[1:24:41] on the internet if I was trying to do
[1:24:43] that but I do not Pastor the internet
[1:24:46] you know that that's right I will not do
[1:24:49] that don't call me asking me your
[1:24:52] questions you ask your pastor you
[1:24:54] question said I got one one or two that
[1:24:57] said I am the pastor I want know I said
[1:25:00] I ain't answering
[1:25:02] yet go to the
[1:25:04] message I said nothing else there's a
[1:25:07] there's a take you'll run down the list
[1:25:08] you'll find on our somewhere that I
[1:25:10] explain that you can go listen to it
[1:25:13] that way cuz I'm not going to Pastor it
[1:25:16] yeah I don't believe in that I believe
[1:25:18] there's one voice to this
[1:25:20] age amen that was brought to this age
[1:25:23] and that was brother Ram's voice
[1:25:25] but I believe it must be taken by the
[1:25:26] fivefold ministry and broke down to the
[1:25:29] people to where that they can eat what's
[1:25:31] being given out because it was in such a
[1:25:34] big old chunks when he gave it out am I
[1:25:35] floting him that's he said I break it
[1:25:38] off in big nuggets he said these
[1:25:39] brothers will take it and break it
[1:25:42] down and he said bring on the coming of
[1:25:44] the Lord I make no
[1:25:47] statement but I'm trying to get you to
[1:25:49] look at a
[1:25:50] point look at number 10 on the on the
[1:25:53] notes we know this it shouldn't be a
[1:25:56] solve problems with you and I it
[1:25:58] shouldn't be anything to think about the
[1:26:00] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:26:01] with a shout what is the
[1:26:05] shout they'll get it in a second then
[1:26:07] you read what the prophet said to shout
[1:26:10] is shout is the message Y what
[1:26:17] message yep who message
[1:26:21] mhm you
[1:26:25] sure get then they get behind them
[1:26:29] there not throwing off them Butz
[1:26:33] sometimes it is I jump from one to the
[1:26:34] other when coming down and they don't
[1:26:36] know where in the world I'm going
[1:26:39] to paragraph 130 through 133
[1:26:43] 134 okay we get it I knew they do
[1:26:47] it said three things happen a voice a
[1:26:51] shout a voice a trumpet now that's not
[1:26:53] four thing right you know what I'm
[1:26:55] saying a
[1:26:57] shout a voice a shout a voice a trumpet
[1:27:01] that's not four
[1:27:02] thing read it three of them is what a
[1:27:05] shout a voice and a trumpet has to
[1:27:08] happen before Jesus
[1:27:10] appears now watch this has to have
[1:27:13] already happened are we in bad shape CU
[1:27:18] watch Jesus does all three of them when
[1:27:22] he's he he's he's descending
[1:27:26] amen so that's perfectly scriptural then
[1:27:30] the shout is the voice of
[1:27:32] God Amen and Jesus does all three of
[1:27:36] these in his descending
[1:27:40] right so then it wasn't brother
[1:27:43] R's
[1:27:47] message it was a message of God Amen
[1:27:50] delivered by Brother Ram into our hand
[1:27:53] that's right read on
[1:27:54] a shout what is the shout it's the
[1:27:57] message going forth first the living
[1:27:59] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[1:28:02] right and God has a way of doing things
[1:28:05] and he never changes his policy he never
[1:28:08] changes his he's the unchanging God in
[1:28:11] Amos 3:7 he said he would do nothing on
[1:28:15] the earth until first he revealed it to
[1:28:17] his servants a prophet just as certain
[1:28:19] as he promised it he'll do it amen amen
[1:28:22] all right Shout
[1:28:26] the
[1:28:28] message you realize
[1:28:31] then as I was saying this morning that
[1:28:35] brother R had to do a work of
[1:28:36] restoration and this isn't according to
[1:28:38] the Rapture um in a minute I'll get more
[1:28:42] of it recognize your day and your
[1:28:43] message I believe brother says not in
[1:28:46] the years of preparation said when it
[1:28:48] begins to
[1:28:49] sound we know that brother brandom had
[1:28:51] to come and preach us back to the faith
[1:28:54] of the fathers or preaches back to the
[1:28:56] revelation of the word of God in its
[1:28:58] Purity we understand that but that was
[1:29:00] not his message that's why that the
[1:29:04] prophet said I had these this morning
[1:29:06] but it didn't didn't bring it do you
[1:29:08] realize that
[1:29:10] we have to be a prophetic people that's
[1:29:14] right
[1:29:16] amen that's what your Prophet said would
[1:29:18] have to be a prophetic
[1:29:21] people and there would have to be a
[1:29:23] prophetic
[1:29:27] message he said not just one studying
[1:29:30] scriptures and things right it's going
[1:29:32] to take a special class of people to be
[1:29:35] able to stand in the end time that's
[1:29:38] why almost 40 years
[1:29:41] ago I said this and that's Brother Ray
[1:29:44] and I talking about this this
[1:29:47] morning somewhere close to 40 years ago
[1:29:51] I told you that the biggest portion of
[1:29:52] the people of this message would die and
[1:29:54] go by the
[1:29:58] grave hey folks don't think that I wrote
[1:30:01] that two weeks ago I've got living proof
[1:30:04] sitting here before me that some people
[1:30:07] have been here for almost 30 years and
[1:30:09] they can tell you that I said it that's
[1:30:12] right right that's right it wasn't two
[1:30:16] weeks ago when I realized that a lot of
[1:30:17] old people going to
[1:30:19] die that's right
[1:30:21] no I just saw the the message people
[1:30:24] were not receiving the
[1:30:28] message and I say it again if we believe
[1:30:30] this message is a
[1:30:32] shout why are we trying to get brother
[1:30:36] so and so to tell us what it means right
[1:30:45] amen why are we trying to get brother
[1:30:47] Dale to tell us what it meant
[1:30:54] if it's a supernatural message it
[1:30:56] requires a supernatural I'm quoting
[1:30:58] Brother brandham people to understand
[1:31:00] that message not just one with the
[1:31:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:31:05] wonderful down through the ages to secur
[1:31:07] us into the body of
[1:31:09] Christ but just like he saids 464 the
[1:31:11] old seal book go home and read
[1:31:14] it he said there's no messenger of the
[1:31:17] age he speaks of Luther he speaks of
[1:31:18] Wesley he speaks of the Pentecostal Lusa
[1:31:22] Street and he says no messenger the age
[1:31:24] he said because the Holy Ghost came
[1:31:26] himself that's right in the fullness but
[1:31:28] said at the end is always of the ages
[1:31:30] said then the messenger is sent Amen
[1:31:33] brother R's message begun in 63 when he
[1:31:35] started bringing those seals and and
[1:31:38] bringing the word to us to Pure
[1:31:41] unadulterated and he preached for almost
[1:31:43] three years there the message bringing
[1:31:45] it amen back up to 62 about the greatest
[1:31:49] battle ever fought and you'll
[1:31:50] automatically come out almost 3 and 1/2
[1:31:52] years of the Ministry just like Jesus
[1:31:55] said
[1:31:59] amen you
[1:32:03] see then we've heard the
[1:32:09] shout there's not going to be a shout to
[1:32:11] raise and to do this out or the
[1:32:14] other I think it should be that you and
[1:32:16] I should shout
[1:32:21] amen you know what amen a shout the
[1:32:26] message yep to get the people ready now
[1:32:30] what was the message the opening of The
[1:32:32] Seven
[1:32:33] Seals now I'm just going to run through
[1:32:35] real fast on
[1:32:37] something cuz when brother brandham come
[1:32:39] over there to preaching in that seventh
[1:32:45] seal he said this is my revelation of
[1:32:49] it he begins to talk about the seven
[1:32:52] Thunders and the opening of the word
[1:32:54] I'm asking you to go home and read the
[1:32:56] seal book for one time and just sit down
[1:32:59] there and think about what you're
[1:33:00] reading the S sealed
[1:33:04] especially he starts explaining about a
[1:33:08] vision that he had many many years ago
[1:33:11] which I think was about s years in
[1:33:13] between there more or something but he
[1:33:15] had it in 1956 he mentions it first one
[1:33:18] of my people talked about used to be
[1:33:20] called the interval uh and
[1:33:25] 56101 I think it's right but anyhow he
[1:33:30] mentions
[1:33:32] about what was known and been called the
[1:33:36] tent
[1:33:38] vision and he starts out by a little
[1:33:41] shoe in the hand and trying to catch the
[1:33:44] little fish and going with the shoe and
[1:33:47] the different things now he
[1:33:50] says this is what was being made known
[1:33:52] to him
[1:33:54] in that seventh
[1:33:56] seal right of what had been in his life
[1:34:00] right we talk about the sword in the
[1:34:03] hand he called it that in the seventh
[1:34:05] seal
[1:34:07] MH but what about where he says the
[1:34:09] sword God put in his hand 30 something
[1:34:12] years ago and told him to March forth to
[1:34:15] the coming of the
[1:34:20] Lord you said well brother Dale you're D
[1:34:23] you're on Danger ground cuz you're
[1:34:24] trying to interpret I'm not trying to
[1:34:26] interpret I'm telling you the things the
[1:34:28] prophet said it was
[1:34:30] right that's up to
[1:34:33] you he said it was that tent
[1:34:37] Vision he said it was the angels of the
[1:34:39] Lord the vision that was haded he was to
[1:34:41] go west and come back and he said this
[1:34:43] is the Fulfillment of that even to the
[1:34:45] angel of the Lord he said come bring me
[1:34:47] back here tonight for this message he
[1:34:49] said right
[1:34:53] he speaks of the sword in the hand where
[1:34:55] he was to go up into sabben Canyon and
[1:34:57] he was scared because he looked he saw a
[1:34:59] sword in his hand and said a voice spoke
[1:35:01] to him and
[1:35:03] said this is the Furman of your
[1:35:07] ministry he had the BL that went off and
[1:35:10] he speaks of out
[1:35:12] west and he thought it was his own
[1:35:19] death and he said this is that third
[1:35:22] pool
[1:35:27] he brings out many many prom or many
[1:35:30] many thoughts that God has dealt with
[1:35:32] him in his
[1:35:34] life and he's explaining what the seal
[1:35:43] is just as I said this morning and will
[1:35:46] say again that Jesus only preached six
[1:35:49] seals CU he was the
[1:35:51] seven that shouldn't be no problem
[1:35:53] problem should it page 45 it's a rising
[1:35:56] the sun he is on
[1:36:03] seals you see
[1:36:06] church he starts telling us what's
[1:36:08] happening in his own ministry that's
[1:36:11] right that's
[1:36:13] right the tent Vision The Sword in the
[1:36:16] hand the Angels he met
[1:36:19] yes the many things that he covers in
[1:36:21] the seventh seal he's talking about God
[1:36:25] in his
[1:36:29] life and the things that had happened
[1:36:32] that week he said it's not been a man
[1:36:34] it's been the angels of the Lord right
[1:36:37] he he said bring me back here for this
[1:36:40] message
[1:36:41] tonight
[1:36:47] amen the great Thunder and the great
[1:36:49] blast he said that went
[1:36:51] forth has now been know amen thank you
[1:36:59] Lord you see he called at the opening of
[1:37:01] the
[1:37:09] word he said there God met
[1:37:12] us the opening of these seals and it
[1:37:15] become a brand new
[1:37:18] book I've heard preachers have in the
[1:37:20] message for 3 months and get up and say
[1:37:22] it's a brand new new
[1:37:24] book I thought you ain't even read the
[1:37:27] first page
[1:37:29] yet you ain't even read page one and how
[1:37:32] can you say it's a new book cuz if you
[1:37:35] going to say it's a new book you got to
[1:37:37] read the book and then say I got a new
[1:37:44] book heard preachers get up and say I
[1:37:47] take every Spirit here under my
[1:37:50] control you ever heard them say that
[1:37:56] I'd hate for something to get up and run
[1:37:57] up
[1:38:03] there I just try to be
[1:38:06] honest I told you I read the seal book
[1:38:09] the first time and when I did when I got
[1:38:11] to the seventh seal I literally
[1:38:13] stopped and I
[1:38:16] thought Lord I've always I've thought
[1:38:19] from what was started studying the
[1:38:20] message and thought this was God's name
[1:38:23] man but now seemingly he's turned to his
[1:38:27] own
[1:38:31] self of expressing his own life instead
[1:38:35] of
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:37] expressing the letter of the word
[1:38:42] even I'm honest that's what I said see
[1:38:45] you won't get preachers to admit stuff
[1:38:46] like that no no I've been in there all
[1:38:49] along I believed it from the beginning
[1:38:55] yeah a lot of you said that it took me
[1:38:58] six months to get you straighten out on
[1:38:59] water baptism
[1:39:01] yeah but yet you think well I'm really I
[1:39:04] seen it right to start with well why
[1:39:05] didn't you do something about it you
[1:39:06] saved me 6
[1:39:08] months I could have been working on
[1:39:10] somebody else that's
[1:39:12] right but listen
[1:39:18] church I studied and studied and studied
[1:39:22] for years then before I ever go back to
[1:39:23] the seal book oh yeah I read
[1:39:26] it but then one day I felt led like that
[1:39:29] there was something and I just
[1:39:34] started now preach 1 2 3 4 5 6 and
[1:39:39] preach what I could see from thoughts
[1:39:41] and ideas from the
[1:39:42] seventh and I laid it
[1:39:47] down because it was like there was
[1:39:49] something
[1:39:51] wrong I wouldn't getting the point
[1:39:54] Point even though I was bringing 79 I
[1:39:57] could if we had to take you would listen
[1:39:59] to them and you'd say well that's
[1:40:00] identically what you're saying now yes
[1:40:05] sir but then one day about 82 I picked
[1:40:08] it up again I begin to
[1:40:12] read then I saw each seal as it become
[1:40:15] to an
[1:40:17] end the end of the first seal was the
[1:40:20] opening of the
[1:40:22] second the only way you can keep your
[1:40:24] star steps running right these
[1:40:25] cartenders out here are no better than
[1:40:27] that thing you got to have something to
[1:40:29] base it on then you got to keep them
[1:40:30] steps in line all the way up and you
[1:40:34] can't put a 6 in step on a 7 in
[1:40:38] Riser your insurance won't cover no am I
[1:40:43] right I don't know exactly what the
[1:40:45] Riser is is it 7 in is a certain that
[1:40:47] measurement but you got to be out and up
[1:40:50] or your insurance won't cover it if your
[1:40:52] insurance comes to your home and your
[1:40:54] steps are not according to
[1:40:57] standard they can sue you people can for
[1:41:02] falling because the step is off because
[1:41:06] you've got 6 in or 7 in out 7 in up what
[1:41:10] it is and that foot raises that every
[1:41:12] time and then you hit the next one it's
[1:41:14] 9 in you
[1:41:16] go and you hit that step cuz your brain
[1:41:19] is set on sitting it on seven that's why
[1:41:23] don't want you to wear your Crocs down
[1:41:26] at the
[1:41:28] airport
[1:41:31] right your
[1:41:32] Crocs you know the shoes cuz they're
[1:41:35] bigger they're wider they got a great
[1:41:38] big hump on the front you start trying
[1:41:40] to go up the steps with it you're going
[1:41:41] to get hung in the
[1:41:44] step you don't never
[1:41:51] read the church listen
[1:41:57] we've had a prophet to bring us a
[1:41:59] message yes
[1:42:01] we we've had the voice of God to speak
[1:42:05] to us well if God would only speak to me
[1:42:08] if God would only speak to me turn on
[1:42:10] the
[1:42:13] tape right turn on the tape and just say
[1:42:16] God speak to my
[1:42:19] heart Jesus
[1:42:23] we got them there to where the other
[1:42:25] night we just sat down and I think we
[1:42:27] listen to Three
[1:42:31] tapes might slept in half of one of them
[1:42:34] but got two of
[1:42:38] them a lot better than doing something
[1:42:43] else lot of people said I go to sleep at
[1:42:46] night with them in the ear that's
[1:42:50] good cuz at least we're hearing the

[1:46:37] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[1:46:39] is by the word and remember the third
[1:46:41] pull was the opening of them Seven
[1:46:46] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's
[1:46:49] been sealed in the word do you see it
[1:46:52] the congregation says
[1:46:56] amen but you say but Brother D there's
[1:46:58] so many things that goes with the third
[1:47:02] pool I there a tent to
[1:47:06] come I never argue with nobody about
[1:47:11] it never argue with nobody about
[1:47:14] it I have a lot of people ask me what I
[1:47:17] thought about it
[1:47:25] you know that they've even tried to
[1:47:27] start out west with tents and come
[1:47:29] across a country y thinking that when
[1:47:32] they would get to Jeffersonville that
[1:47:33] brother brandom would meet them
[1:47:36] there people because they're honest sure
[1:47:40] there's people that's got our planes
[1:47:42] ready to
[1:47:45] fly I'm not arguing about
[1:47:50] it the only thing I said about them
[1:47:53] airplane and sure it hurt my feelings to
[1:47:55] find out that they said R random was
[1:47:57] supposed to be in that certain airplane
[1:47:59] and the man said he he said it' take two
[1:48:01] years to get this thing where it could
[1:48:03] be
[1:48:03] flying well I'm just honest now you get
[1:48:07] mad at me he means it can't come for two
[1:48:10] years cuz he ain't went to work on it
[1:48:15] yet I like what brother per green had to
[1:48:18] say about it which wasn't derogatory
[1:48:19] said brother ROM needs a airplane I'll
[1:48:21] get him a 746
[1:48:24] sure I'll beat that I'll get him a
[1:48:28] c5a cuz it's plenty big enough yeah
[1:48:31] right and I'm not thring no remarks at
[1:48:35] nobody right I've had people to lambas
[1:48:38] me to say you're out of the message
[1:48:40] because you don't believe the way we
[1:48:42] believe it well that's all
[1:48:44] right I'm just always honest with
[1:48:47] everybody if I don't see what you're
[1:48:49] talking about I told Paul Jones that
[1:48:51] about the sus old messy m s and talking
[1:48:54] with him I said I don't see what you're
[1:48:56] talking about I said I am not saying

[1:49:05] amen that's the only thing that I've
[1:49:06] ever done with
[1:49:10] anybody but you

[1:49:16] day the prophet can come
[1:49:18] back and he can preach to us for 30 40
[1:49:21] days I have no problem with that
[1:49:24] huh I don't have any trouble with that
[1:49:27] cuz the Dead's going to raise they going
[1:49:30] to be around your Ms about 30 40
[1:49:32] days of course every like I always say
[1:49:35] you know wouldn't it be something I call
[1:49:37] brother brother Ray up and said Brother
[1:49:41] Ray have you heard about it they say the
[1:49:46] dead already
[1:49:49] right but I don't know where to believe
[1:49:51] it cuz I have you seen anything brother

[1:51:06] ROM can come back and preach we can have
[1:51:09] a wonderful
[1:51:12] time but I still got to depend upon the
[1:51:15] scriptures that's right that he's in the
[1:51:18] ground waiting on you and I that's right
[1:51:23] I've got to say that cuzz that's what I
[1:51:25] believe he's waiting on you and I to

[1:51:30] believing that he'll be the first in the
[1:51:32] resurrection right don't have no trouble
[1:51:35] with that that's right that's right
[1:51:36] that's
[1:51:38] right you see then I've been ridiculed
[1:51:41] because I won't say that I believe
[1:51:45] this I've had people to throw it in the
[1:51:47] face said how you going to spiritualize
[1:51:49] in Johnny
[1:51:51] houses youever heard

[1:52:17] right that won't believe the word right
[1:52:20] right
[1:52:23] amen you think the people would believe
[1:52:24] you think that any of the doctrines of
[1:52:26] the message the two Souls have done a
[1:52:28] virtue you think they're going to
[1:52:29] believe it if somebody told you in
[1:52:30] little Georgia the dead was walking
[1:52:32] Among Us no I ain't going to believe it
[1:52:36] you know why CU it's not in their
[1:52:38] Church you know what I wouldn't believe
[1:52:40] if he was in
[1:52:44] their to be
[1:52:48] honest you said the Dead's raised up
[1:52:50] here and this where they got polygamy I
[1:52:52] don't want that don't send to
[1:52:56] Georgia I'm not joking true that's
[1:53:00] true you see I hope you've enjoyed this
[1:53:02] and I've tried to bring about the seals
[1:53:04] now we're just going to get into some
[1:53:05] things in the Book of Revelation
[1:53:07] continue there through be related to the
[1:53:09] seals and continue on out through I will
[1:53:12] announce this I still have it laid on my
[1:53:15] test to preach on marriage and divorce
[1:53:18] and maybe about 6 months from now I
[1:53:20] might get around preaching on but uh you
[1:53:23] know cuz I do that about every four or 5
[1:53:26] years or something just you know going
[1:53:29] through with the message not to ridicule
[1:53:31] nobody but just stay it like it is
[1:53:33] forget
[1:53:34] it cuz it's not time to argue and fuss
[1:53:37] over doctrines that's
[1:53:41] right it's time to walk amen that's
[1:53:45] right time to
[1:53:48] Rejoice about what we've heard
[1:53:53] brother R said John heard His
[1:53:56] Voice through the opening of The
[1:54:00] Seal have we heard our voice that's
[1:54:03] right that's right you don't call Gil
[1:54:06] Addison but every Revelation has been
[1:54:09] made known yes
[1:54:13] amen he's speaking your name amen thank
[1:54:16] you Jesus come on musician he speak in
[1:54:20] your name you heard the voice of God
[1:54:22] through the prophet of God we've heard
[1:54:26] his words we've heard the
[1:54:29] shout and you read the rest of the
[1:54:36] message voice of an archangel the same
[1:54:39] voice that raised Lazarus with the same
[1:54:41] voice that shouted that's right the Lord
[1:54:45] Jesus does all three of these things in
[1:54:47] his descending that's
[1:54:50] right so then we're not looking for the
[1:54:52] descending of brother brandom we're
[1:54:54] looking our have been looking for the
[1:54:56] descending of God but I hope we get away
[1:54:59] from looking for his coming to believe
[1:55:01] that he's here
[1:55:02] already he's here revealing his word
[1:55:05] that's
[1:55:07] right the more we believe that you'll
[1:55:09] see more healings and signs and wonders
[1:55:12] in
[1:55:14] 82 I asked God for
[1:55:18] something I don't ask him
[1:55:24] I don't ask God to prove his message for
[1:55:26] signs and
[1:55:29] wonders cuz it's already been
[1:55:34] done but I asked him in 82 there when I
[1:55:37] was preaching I said Lord when I finish
[1:55:40] I wanted
[1:55:42] to see how many people were healed and
[1:55:45] delivered during this
[1:55:47] series almost every person in the
[1:55:50] building raised their hand and test of
[1:55:52] things that was
[1:55:55] happening see I I don't have to
[1:55:58] have brother Brandon was a Vindicated
[1:56:02] Prophet I don't have to have a
[1:56:04] Vindication to prove what I am that's
[1:56:07] right I follow a
[1:56:11] message that the Lord himself descended
[1:56:13] by that message yes amen so why am I
[1:56:16] looking for the coming of the
[1:56:17] Lord now you'll see why that I made
[1:56:20] those statements back there a few weeks
[1:56:21] ago when talking about the prophet said
[1:56:23] the Seven Seals the coming of the Lord
[1:56:25] and I made a statement he started his
[1:56:28] coming on the day of Pentecost right
[1:56:30] right it took him 4,000 years to come
[1:56:33] the first time he started his coming on
[1:56:36] the day of Pentecost 2,000 years the
[1:56:39] people have been enjoying his
[1:56:43] coming that's why we're not looking for
[1:56:45] it we're looking at it the thing right
[1:56:48] think on these things go home and read
[1:56:50] the seal book now and just read it and
[1:56:53] say God the man told me to just read the
