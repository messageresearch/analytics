and my mom was going to be Bachelorette and Susan where'd she go yeah she's going to be happy praise the Lord Friday night and said that y'all are late y'all this video then I'm like oh my gosh I gotta hurry I had called her today before and told her we were coming on Monday well and she caught she said she thought Donald was coming I said well no he's not coming till Monday and she said with white hail and I said yeah I just thought he was late I was worried I said okay he might have been late for last year's huh he would have been early for this year but just keep us in your prayers and we'll have fun and be safe and I want you to bring him back with a better Spirit or living there bring Dawn back with the best Spirit of the alabamians okay praise the Lord you've got a few weeks to live with it well this week you don't have to live with it so you get a week off maybe you need a question and answer box big enough no not a box big enough all right well this another thing is coming up that's really important that that um I feel important to us is I know that um at the time is we we always say the time's near the times at hand you know for the for the catching away in the bride and I believe it but you know brother random said if you were building a house he should continue building it even if you know the Lord was coming tomorrow right plant potatoes go ahead and plant them today if you even know the Lord's going to come tomorrow so if you and I went through this Financial Peace University class given by Dave Ramsey last year and if it wasn't for that class when I went from a thousand dollars a week to 600 a week we would have been in trouble but being that we went through this class we didn't miss a lake I mean we didn't miss anything we already had everything set up for it and you say well you ought to be able to do it without coming to the class remember we're sheep why we got deacons we don't need deacons if everybody's got the Holy Ghost and everybody will act right we don't need deacons but we got deacons in the church right we don't need preachers God said he'd talk to us individually but no you got to have them because we're sheep we have to be led all right we have to be told what to do when you like it or not we have to be told what to do and you know somebody can beat it in you but a lot of times you know they can try to beat it in you but unless you really see it on paper I was telling Richard this morning that June and I we went through this class back in February and it's a commitment it's a committal class because you've got to come 13 weeks straight can't miss but one one lesson congratulations you got to physically go for it and where Keller Williams has been generous to let us borrow their room up in Gainesville which is a more central location uh to have it here we've had to put up a screen because a lot of us caught on DVD by Dave himself we'd had to do it in the sanctuary and I don't have a problem with doing it in sanctuary but we need to leave money matters you know as individuals maybe do it we had a big place down here we could have done it but Keller Williams through sister Rebecca and sister uh are gracious enough to let us have it and we we're going to open it to anyone you'll see posters and like I said on Richard he said well what's the cost well it doesn't cost you anything to come to the first preview which is going to be on February the 23rd that's on Thursday he said why why Thursday well if you're going to be committed you'll come if you don't you won't I mean that's just the way it is we we didn't miss a course I missed one because I had preaching no brother just died but just died February the 14th last year and I went to the funeral and I missed one of the classes on Friday but if we have them on Thursday from 7 to 9 at Keller Williams some of you may not be able to attend which is fine I mean it's okay but we'll be teaching a Financial Peace University class it is a faith-based it is not a get rich quick scheme it's not something you're going to probably like we didn't like it at first but then it became fun didn't it okay I mean it's fine now uh and it's one thing mama always taught us she always said you know you need this not spend your money before you get it well that's okay that's old that's old school Now Dave teaches that you spend your money before you get it it works out much better to spend your money before you get it than it is after you get it because your money has to have a name you say well I'm going to make 600 this week all right well you know you have 600 you should take a whole month and you spread it out in a whole year and you spread this thing out and you put them in envelopes and we'll we'll uh I don't spend much time on it but I just want to kind of give you something to good luck at brother Dale said it was okay for us to do it so it's it's fine to uh to try to do this because you know it's we still got to live in this world and whether we like it or not we got to make money until they take it all away from us we got to make money to survive and we have learned to be able to give more we got to be able to save more uh you'll see if you take the course that out in the in the world of of the Evangelical Christians only three percent of the people tied now that don't happen in this church probably 97 percent of the people kind of in this church are 90 should be it should be 100 I don't know why it isn't because you're robbing yourself of a blessing not God God doesn't need your money God can do with ten percent what we can't do with 90. that's right right and he never has looked at the stock market to see no he's always had something in place to uh to uh to take care of his uh economy because we're not building a kingdom down here but it is a lot easier that if you hit a financial crunch to be able to say hey I got something to fall back on hey we got a little money put together here or like Terrence and I were talking the other day he said well you know what he said all these people that that rented houses I'm talking about message people it's renting houses and done all this stuff and took their kids out of school and worked hard for a living they come down to the old age and they don't have nothing because they thought the Rapture was going to take place so we're not going to put any money up not only smart to start putting money up it doesn't matter if you know God's coming tomorrow because what if he don't come in 10 more years a lot of us are going to be in our 60s all right so I'm in there 70s think about that online you'll be 70 years old but anyway if you want to come that's fine we may teach one later on in the year down toward Commerce because some of those down there want us to uh to do one down there but it's really fun it's it's something that it only takes two hours of your time a week and you know we sit around and go on the internet and do things like that and it is I wouldn't do it if it wasn't Christian based he doesn't have any off-colored jokes or say he's really um to be a nominal Christian I guess he's probably one of the best ones you can you can get if you listen to the radio program he has radio programs all over the country he does not want you to become Filthy Rich he just wants you to be able to live be able to live through life and do things and but on February the 23rd we're going to have a preview session at Keller Williams at seven o'clock then the classes start March the 1st and they end the week before May of the uh Memorial Day weekend which June and I will be going to Wichita during that weekend so I'm glad it ends at that time but it's a 13-week course like I was telling Richard you can believe this or not we when we started the course the kits are 100. to get the kids you get a lifetime membership you get all these resources from his website and also it teaches you the average person that takes this class is pays off 2700 2700 worth of debt and save a thousand dollars you're in that 13 week so it's a pretty good investment June and I of course I was making money then you know making the the thousand dollars a week then and we were doing fine we paid off 6 500 in debt in 13 weeks and we saved a thousand dollars for our emergency fund just in 13 weeks not by collecting any other income I think the only big thing we've done I sold a four wheeler to a Boyden and whatever that tall guy's name is early so it's a good thing Dave teaches the class yeah but but it's fine it's just something you know that it's something to do that's not wasteful the time's not wasteful so it's an investment just think about it and it's productive and it is but it's a commitment you say well I don't know about 13 weeks well you know you may not do the course either because June and I are still doing you know I don't agree with every principle the man has but if I agree with 90 of them then I can apply that 90 to what I'm doing and it makes me 90 better all right so and it's really not for everybody but you know what there's there was a lady in our class that was a single mom had two kids she was struggling bad and she got better in that 13 weeks you didn't pay off 6 500 worth of debt but she paid off some debt and she had a thousand dollar emergency fund within that 13 weeks didn't do anything different she just changed her uh attitude toward how she keeps her money all right so remember that just for your information we'll have posters up here sister Rebecca is going to take some to Keller Williams we're going to post it on the website and uh if anybody wants to attend they sure can well let's try to chapter six let's finish with the third seal I want to finish it up today and get it get it complete now everybody remember the banquet coming up is on what the 18th I gotta get these out of the way the 18th the 11th is the Youth Camp Lord willing in March the 23rd through the 26th or 27th June and I are going to be at Ron Spencer's for a little time of rest and relaxation and have a meeting that weekend so just be keep us in the prayer and like I said we'll be at brother Dutch God's at the end of this end of this month so just remember us chapter six and when it opened the third seal verse five and when you opened the third seal I heard the third Beach they come and see and I'll be held a little black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beats they a measure of wheat for opinion three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now let's turn over to Matthew 24. verse seven so remember verse 5 would be your first steal verse 6 would be your second seal verse seven and eight would be your third seal for nation Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows I don't know if you read the paper this morning or looked on the internet but it's kind of a striking thing that that earthquakes and divers places there was earthquake in Ohio the other day that they said was caused because they're going after natural gas so they call it fracturing or fracking and what they go in is they go in and they actually blast at an angle through a rock to get to that natural gas and what it's doing is when you do it at an angle what happens if there's anything underneath there that that don't need to be there or some kind of hole what happened that's what an earthquake is moving of the ground so this morning out in Oregon they're actually drilling into a volcano and going to press water into that volcano could create geothermal steam at the top of the volcano where they've got a turbine and they're going to try to generate power that way as I said that people were concerned that if you push water down in there what's going to happen they don't have a clue so man is really my point is man is really earthquakes don't have to just be that the Earth is moving man's doing a lot of things think of all the oil we take out on the ground why do you think there's sinkholes in Florida we're taking all the groundwater up out of the out of the soil and guess what it just falls down so man is one that's destroying ourselves Nation shall rise against Nations see that's man nation is not what is Israel what is Russia it's the people right all right same way with hearing Kingdom Satan's kingdom against God's Kingdom but see he made a promise in this third uh seal that ceases do not hurt the oil and wine so he's going to protect the group of people we said they showed entire that this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the third seal right and then we see that the pair of balances that the Catholic church was charging for no business Wheaton of barley was the staff of life and the black horse was denomination their death that was set up in the fifth and sixth Church age because of denominational ideas because the the first seal you saw that Antichrist Spirit there was people talking about things then you see it come a little bit closer become a false prophet and then we got the Beast coming up here and what's that happened this this denominational idea has now moved over into what we call the bride it's not out there anymore it's in here the denomination brother Daniel's been preaching a long time our own denominational ideas is what's killing us well this is what I think it is stop this is what I think it is stop and you see many preachers across the land preaching false Doctrine well what is that that's a denomination that's not God God Don't Preach false doctors man preaches false doctor so as the Black Death the black horse comes riding in which is the Blackness of death also we got to see that like what brother Dale's been preaching that you can't condemn a dead man my damn man can't sin you're dead can't stand can't do anything wrong we covered that before in this but as all the nations are rising against nation and all the doctrines against doctrines we see that all these things are the beginning of Sorrows verse 8 look that's what's happening all these are the beginning of Sorrow now we know for a fact excuse me a fact that these seals are going to open in their natural form and have open in their natural form and let's clear something up I think I maybe mentioning it before but in the seals you can see that the seals are not open hold on and you can see that the seals are open because if you don't have a revelation they're not open okay so where brother Brown says well the seventh seal has not been Vindicated yet on this episode not been revealed yet that's true but he says the seventh seal has been open Jesus opened six of them right here and then he was the seventh that that you had to know him his own people didn't even know it but to see on the day of Pentecost that man was revealed in a portion to that group of 120 in the upper room and that sealed them in so the seals are open it's an open book you don't ever see a closed book you see open book all right same way with you and I and then during all this time of of enrollment I mean in yeah in Romans and all that talking about adoption that's what leads us up we've got to be able to know that that man we got to have the intelligence of the real man who Jesus Christ he was the only man that real I guess you might say the whole package deal he was the greatest man that ever walked on the face here he said well he was God he was man also but he was God man right right he was a great he was the Fulfillment of what God wanted in the Garden of Eden that's right right but it's the shrewness of this combat Beast is coming in and we've got to have the shrewness of God Amen the knowledge it's not bad to have knowledge see right there on a pyramid have knowledge what not not not not not how to you know do calculus or trick no we need the knowledge to know that when this comes we cast it out that's right that's why brother Brown will say here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse rider well see here stands the land with a book in his hand there goes the rainbow shark here stands the land with a book in his hand there goes to black horse rider you got to see that opposition riding away from your ideas you gotta see that that's why these seals are so important for the Redemption of this body to be real honest with you you don't need the seals to be a born-again Christian well um FM Bosworth didn't have the seal and the form that we're looking at now sure everybody's read them and everybody's commented on them and made commentary but there's going to be a lot of people but see they never made the change of the body they had never had somebody come on the scene to explain and say hey this is important this has got to be understood you've got to see this opposition riding away from you because in all actuality Luther Luther didn't see this because he still took on he didn't take on denomination he was not a denomination but he took on that father-son Holy Ghost baptism which was that horse still riding but God winked at that and said hey I know you don't need to understand that you can't understand it but I've got to put it in my Bible they are in my word so that we can take a body change and therefore we take a body change everybody behind us I hope you understood that in Revelations when we're reading Revelations 8 a long time ago it says the whole creation is groaning and waiting well that's not just the dogs and the cats and the trees that's the people that's going on right that's the people that's going on they were in Ukraine they were Creek New Creation if they were born again they're dead waiting on us so they grown and wait how long how long but not to have been into our blood but how long how long in that dimension they told Brother grandma if you had to come but the angel said hey you're going to go back to Earth with this group of people because they're not complaining they don't have their human bodies good yeah I thought I needed the regulation of the seals only to get out of here and FF boss was of another age he is in another age but he had the new birth without understanding the sales that's what I said no but I am required to have this Revelation right he was not required but what I said was he didn't maybe I didn't say to clear them you can have the new birth and not have the revelation of these seals because a new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ which is the seals but in part that's right in cars right okay in part A lot of those people brother Brown were preaching to were born again Christians and he said it's gone from you you're not going to get it that didn't mean that everyone was going to hell no right but they were just not to the ability to understand this at the time and enough with the Holy Ghost teaching I said holy ghost teaching they had enough of the Holy Ghost to get them in the body they just didn't have enough Holy Ghost teaching to open that book completely and say hey I got enough for this guy to be changed now not just the one inside of me I got enough of this so I'm not saying that they didn't have the Holy Ghost I'm saying that they can you can have the Holy Ghost and I don't understand the seals but in this age it's required that if you get the Holy Ghost it'll lead you into all truth which is this right here most of them die are all of them died all of them all of them died that's the whole case they have the whole case they even the ones that died from from uh what today's 15th from February the 15th 2002 from their back they did not get the total revelation of these seals because they died true total revelation of these seals makes a body change right yeah okay you ever understand that maybe maybe I could confuse you more not trying to help you no but what I'm trying to say is you can't you can't say well I gotta understand this to get the Holy Ghost no you got to get the Holy Ghost to understand this that's right but to get the Holy Ghost and not understand these is not a problem you're just gonna have to die before you take a body change is that okay everybody all right over there you okay with that FF Bosworth is dead all the people from February the 15th 2012 from this day backwards trying to think of somebody even brother Tom some of the ones just went on they went on because they didn't have the total Revelation and hey you know what 21 I was sitting in here brother Brown said one in a million yes they might be 20 of us have to die yeah one left that's right in this room right here but no shame I mean we're all born again right no shame that's right Body Spirit Souls got chain back then but they had to die but you've got to know this to get all three of these things change and that's what Daddy's really trying to preach right now he's really trying to preach that that Soul inside perfect and I love it when he's preaching on Romans 8 1 there's therefore now now no condemnation he ain't talking about soul soul never had condemnation start with but he said there is therefore now no he must be talking about something else must be talking about the outside guys that's right that's right everybody understand that yes one more time Revelations eight there is therefore now no condemnation so Paul came to a point in his Revelation or in his prophecy that there was going to come a group of people that even your body was not going to have anything counted against you not that we're going to be a bunch of robots or be a bunch of people that you know uh don't live life just like we're talking about going to this course I still believe in you know we got to still live I've seen quacks you've seen quacks you've seen people in this message you know take all the kids out of school put them to work you know what they'll work till the day they die they don't ever have nothing uh you know look who want to have a brother Danny he's a good example if they have not prepared before you never know you may fall off the house tomorrow and I may fall off the house tomorrow I know if you don't wish I known me worst enemy but what I'm saying is I go in in these foreclosed homes and I see these great big homes I see a swimming pool I see a place where they used to park a boat at least it does too you see I mean you go and they probably made wives of money you know 100 Grand a year maybe or more or 200 Grand a year some of these when we do gone why because maybe the wife boom lost their job so now they got to live off one income they've extended their stuff so much till like Lisa said if they had enough money to buy and fill up a swimming pool they ought to save that money and paid the bill and that's the truth and that's what this course will teach you too it'll give you a little bit and it'll give you scriptural background because you know the Bible says that the borrower is always slave to the lender that's right always the borrower if you borrow and hey I owe money on my house but that's it I don't own no more man it's not my house just a little bit not much but you still if anything ever happened to me or anything ever happened to Jim well June I don't want anything just to happen to her but since I haven't heard but I'd be okay but if anything ever happened to me I should have enough provision that she can at least pay the house off and have some money left over right because you never know you said well we're going to take a Rapture one in a million remember that's one in a million believers that's not one in a million out here in the world right that was one in a million believers are going to stand for the body chain so you know the message 40 something year and I've heard that 40 something years we're going in the Raptor so we're not going to yeah put up nothing or nothing but this live and spend everything and whatever and them people don't have it and we've even heard people that say that they they go in they just get a credit card and run the credit card bill up because they were going in a Rapture well guess what they're still playing on them now because rap train took place and that was 20 something years ago so you know that's just really not intelligent trying to get away from all the mother words I told them to have to shop the other day I didn't want to hear idiot and stupid again because I hear that all day I don't hear it no more so we got they're not intelligent are less intelligent and that's true we all have a little bit of an intelligence problem when it comes to a lot of things I'm not strong in a lot of areas I'm weak in a lot of areas but you know what we base everything on though that God will take care of us but we don't be stupid that God's gonna take care of us say well we're just not going to work God's Gonna no he's not gonna put that pork chop on your plate you're gonna go Walmart or film her and buy that pork chop now when you get Dash print and you've done all you can do and you don't know there's nothing else to do and you you know you fall sick or something happens to you I believe God will take care of you but not just willingly say hey I ain't doing a thing God's just going to take care of all my needs see brother Danny and sister George they took care of a lot of their needs beforehand they had insurance they had money put back and they're okay my point is if that would have happened to a normal couple that's why we do foreclosed homes because if brother Dan lost his income for a year almost when his year almost a year right out of the Year wasn't it one of you take what you make a year and say I'm not making that no more for a year and see how long you're gonna last thank you sister you're not going to last long at all but they made Provisions they were intelligent enough humanly intelligent enough to say hey this could happen and then not being foolished I mean they drive car with 300 000 miles on it so do I now how much 365 365 000 miles you say my gosh but you know what Dave Ramsey loves that he said hey no car payment finally the car is paying off because you never went on a car you know that as well as I do you always gonna you know be behind but but as long as you keep it up I mean where do we they drive a long way to work every day get in and go but you know what make Provisions what I'm saying same thing with these seals we're going to make Provisions that's right that it's not just that we're going to be saved and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost that's okay but we something's pulling us further because the Holy Ghost said I'll be with you even in you and I'll in other words take you into all truth show you things to come right so God I believe God's given us a holy intelligence so we don't have to be filthy rich but we don't have to live poor either right I call it comfortable and and in this class what helped what helped me it modified my behavior June and I were doing some things Danny Joyce were doing some things but this really modifies your behavior it makes you do things that you sometimes you don't want to do you'll hear Dave Ramsey say beans and rice and then the next night you have something different you have rice and beans that's true but I mean why and look if you enjoy a steak that's fine but but you know he kind of gives you a gives you a lot of pointers and I really enjoyed it I'm like that that's fine do I you just get them if you can afford steak that's fine send it on paper first yeah that's one that's what this whole thing is you put it on paper and that's the same thing that talk about these seals it's something that you've got to be committed to you can't just not read your Bible and get revelation of the seal if you can't just not come to church but once or twice a month and get the revelation of the sales you can't do that right and you know what you know that but a lot of people know that and still do it see that's that's where iniquity comes in I remember the first seal was the mystery of iniquity knowing to do different and you don't do it right knowing to do different you said to Message Church you know these things and some Jesus said one time you know in the reading of the when David reads the the scripture for the communion he says happier they happier ye if you do them right what do the artists of God happy are you if you do that all right so have your you if we do finish this we're going to finish this third seal by showing that we need to we need to still die even though we're born again we need to still die pop was talking this morning and I was just talking about we're not rich whatever pay your time he promised promise that's right that's right and if he does that you're not going to starve or you're not going to be without something somebody told me one time said I can't afford to pay my ties I said I can't afford nothing exactly right that's the first check we write every month and Dave even tell you he said that but that's so strange that you see these great big churches they're building out in the world these great big worship centers they're building and only three percent of their congregation Ties on a regular basis in other words every week right that's hard to believe right yeah it's hard to believe do it he's blessing something yeah somebody's getting a blessing you know and that's what's that's what you and I need to look at these seals these seals are not a condemnation the seals are a condemnation to the world but it's a blessing to us right this is this should be blessing you say death yeah it's too much of me alive I know that you know why because I live with this guy right here every day I see that I need to do just like Paul Die daily Paul wasn't talking about dying for the Holy Ghost again he already had the Holy Ghost so what was going to die the old nature he said well the old Nature's dead somewhere in there that old nature of me is gone that used to do the things of the world but I still got a spirit that Satan can still penetrate down through this through these and these and this right the five senses he can still penetrate at least down to that spirit and you live in memory reason conscious affection and Imagination five things that you that Satan still plays in those five Realms right he can't play down into Faith or doubt if he's not down there your faith right but what do we do we build the wall that holds that Holy Ghost and don't let it out but then when we let the Holy Ghost take over our memory take over our reasoning that's right I wished I could lose my memory I really do back until 12 years ago I wish my memory would just erase but you know God said he never even remembered the sins to start with thank God for that because if he remembered him he'd have to account them to you that's right man see so he don't account to you because he can't remember him but see we then we do things every day that we have to ask God to forgive him for I hope you pray every morning God forgive me don't forgive me of what I've done forgive me I mean forgive me what's coming forgive me what I've done go be Catholic Lord forgive me this morning I know I'm going to sin well no Lord help me I know what I've done yesterday forgive me of that help me not to do it today because if you keep doing this every week there's that word idiot that I don't want to say okay you just less smart move your finger right right your finger in other words what do something different if it ain't working do something different all right Lord bless you we're going to start on the fourth seal probably the month of February let these guys have a little time thank you brother Joe for taking on the last week good job about that
