[20:21] remember all of these and remember now
[20:23] that the brothers are to meet downstairs
[20:27] after the service to kind of say a few
[20:30] things or what we got to do or get set
[20:32] for the Father's Day banquet that we
[20:36] have they don't call it that up on the
[20:38] mountains when you're sitting back in

[21:21] with it yeah okay you know all the kids
[21:24] are brother Joe told me that sister
[21:29] Quinn wasn't feeling too good so she
[21:31] went home so reading over her and prayed
[21:34] the Lord would cut you okay anything
[21:36] else you have any father we thank you
[21:41] Lord Jesus for your grace and your love
[21:43] and to us thank you for all things and
[21:46] we just ask you to guide us and direct
[21:48] us that your understanding Lord would be
[21:52] with each and every one of us
[21:53] we pray that you would open our
[21:55] understanding today review yourself and
[21:58] push because without a revelation we're
[22:00] in when I've got a lot of problems but
[22:04] yet Lord we pray that you will review
[22:07] yourself because you promised it and
[22:08] that's what we can depend on you said
[22:11] you would do it so we just stand here in
[22:13] the last days and what you make yourself
[22:16] manifest among your people and we love
[22:19] you and we think you have your way as we
[22:21] read your word you come in speak to each
[22:24] one of us in Jesus name
[22:30] okay very familiar Scripture with
[22:32] everybody proverbs 18 verse 10 the name
[22:38] of the Lord is a strong tower the
[22:42] righteous run into it and is safe let's
[22:48] go over now to Exodus chapter 6 and the
[22:59] Lord said unto Moses now see what I will
[23:03] do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand
[23:07] till he let them go and with a strong
[23:10] hand shall he drive them out of the land
[23:13] and God spoken to Moses and said unto
[23:16] him I am the Lord and I appeared unto
[23:22] Abraham unto Isaac and under Jacob by
[23:27] the name of Almighty God but by my name
[23:32] Jehovah was I'm not made known to them
[23:37] you may be seated the Lord at his
[23:39] blessing to the reading of the word now
[23:42] we want to talk about very simple talk
[23:47] very but I want to get into the Lord
[23:52] willing
[23:53] maybe Wednesday if not next Sunday we
[23:57] want to start kind of on the Godhead and
[23:59] this will get a few things out of the
[24:01] way to work that we can continue in to
[24:07] that
[24:07] point all right now I wrote myself a
[24:10] note for you to think about because
[24:14] anytime you talk about the name of the
[24:16] Lord of the name of God or whatever
[24:19] people's mind in the message will start
[24:22] relating to a new name well I wrote it
[24:28] like this don't worry about the new name
[24:35] until we can see that the name of God is
[24:40] Jesus why worry about a new name if you
[24:48] can't think about the name of God being
[24:51] Jesus all right now what is the name of
[24:57] the Lord we read there in the scriptures
[24:59] said the name of the Lord is a strong
[25:01] tower the righteous run into it and are
[25:05] safe what is the name of the Lord
[25:08] now how many gods do we believe in one
[25:16] true and living God right
[25:20] he has many manifestations
[25:24] he has many titles he has many ways of
[25:30] making himself known but there's only
[25:34] one true and living God he's oh no no we
[25:40] got to believe in the Father Son and
[25:41] Holy Ghost that's the way you make up
[25:44] one God without Father Son and Holy
[25:48] Ghost you don't have one God so don't
[25:50] run off to the oneness ideas and
[25:53] concepts and thoughts keep it in the
[25:56] right order
[25:57] because Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[26:00] a name oh it's in the name of God well
[26:07] you can make anything of God you can
[26:10] make a book of God or this PN I mean
[26:12] this pulpit thing of God or or anything
[26:16] that you can think of because the word
[26:19] God
[26:20] simply means an object of worship right
[26:27] now so we'll get back into all of these
[26:30] things but I want you to think about it
[26:33] you see yeah but I've always just heard
[26:35] you know you said well what's the name
[26:37] of God's of God that you're not
[26:42] listening to the thought me your this
[26:47] meaning you're just picking up because
[26:49] of what you've been called all of your
[26:50] life you're not listening to understand
[26:56] you think you already have it in your
[27:00] understanding you think you got in
[27:01] English just go home and look up the
[27:04] word God you can be anything that you
[27:09] make between you and Almighty God all
[27:15] right now so then when you say the name
[27:18] God that's just a title and that's like
[27:28] Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm a father
[27:32] I'm a son I'm a human being
[27:35] right I'm a pastor of a church I retired
[27:39] from General Motors right you can bring
[27:41] up many titles relating to you but you
[27:46] only have one name now I'll make this
[27:52] statement over cuz I'm pretty sure it
[27:53] won't finish this afternoon but just
[27:57] remember if you have but one God you
[28:01] have but one name that should be
[28:05] sensible they shouldn't need a great big
[28:07] black book turn home you know mmm
[28:12] see then when you get into the
[28:14] scriptures and all then you won't follow
[28:16] the point of where that it uses many
[28:20] titles or many appoints huh now in
[28:25] Isaiah it was speaking of I believe is
[28:27] right now where it speaks of bringing
[28:31] forth the son you know the virgin
[28:33] he says you'll name him Emmanuel well
[28:40] you get over in the New Testament
[28:42] Matthew 'native what it will say in his
[28:44] name's you'll be called Emmanuel what
[28:48] didn't they call him Emmanuel run the
[28:55] Bible says to call him Emmanuel why did
[29:00] they not calling that they did when they
[29:05] named him Jesus because Emmanuel means
[29:12] cuz it was on to explain it there in
[29:15] Matthew in the scripture called his name
[29:18] Emmanuel which is by interpretation God
[29:23] with us but why didn't they call him
[29:28] Emmanuel you've got a lot of arguments
[29:33] among your church world systems and
[29:36] things that you've got names like Yahweh
[29:40] you got Jehovah you got Elohim you got
[29:45] all kind of names hava very flimsy it CV
[29:49] I think you got all kind of names now
[29:59] why would we be concerned that way when
[30:04] to show you simple little scriptures and
[30:07] things Jesus said I come in my father's
[30:10] name in that Scripture what's the
[30:17] father's name if his name was Jesus
[30:24] his father was Jesus no no that don't
[30:29] make sense got my little bear your name
[30:32] is Samuel and your son is Wade and
[30:35] Terrence and her daughter Anna you're
[30:39] not thinking we're not talking about
[30:42] like that jesus said I come in my father
[30:47] name and watch him and he said you won't
[30:53] receive me but said another coming their
[30:56] name he said you'll accept them Baptist
[31:03] Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal Brown
[31:06] tomate whatever you want to make them
[31:10] alright
[31:11] this will be serious about it and take
[31:13] out of your mind that don't be concerned
[31:16] about some form of a new name just hold
[31:21] on and let's talk about the name of
[31:25] Jesus but in doing that remember all the
[31:32] things and if you'll take a reference
[31:34] and run it backwards you'll run it all
[31:36] the way back through and it lacks to go
[31:39] back through the word Joshua it will go
[31:43] back into meaning
[31:45] Jehovah Savior is the name Jesus all
[31:50] right now so let's get the thoughts in
[31:54] our mind and just take it slow and easy
[31:57] because I want you to see something
[31:59] because you know you'd say well what do
[32:02] you mean his name is Jesus
[32:04] is that saying what somebody else says
[32:08] and we were illustrating this morning
[32:15] or is it saying something that you have
[32:19] experienced of that night is it a
[32:27] revelation to you that his name is Jesus
[32:33] alright asking you simple questions up
[32:36] front I asked the question one time and
[32:44] I know it's not too popular because it
[32:46] awakened out and I was starting to try
[32:50] to bring forth the series years ago and
[32:54] everybody was talking about son of man
[32:58] this is back in the 80s
[33:01] and you know son of man son of man son
[33:04] of man and I asked a simple question I
[33:10] said when I say son of God what is the
[33:16] first time if you think of in the Bible
[33:20] or expressing it is you come forth the
[33:23] son of God I said I said write it down I
[33:28] said just record it and hold it to that
[33:30] point even if I say it now what is it
[33:33] when I say son of God what do you think
[33:35] about then I went ahead and expressed it
[33:40] I said and I didn't know and realize the
[33:44] biggest portion of the people admitted
[33:46] it that their thoughts was 2000 years
[33:49] ago of Jesus Christ walking on the
[33:52] shores of Galilee would be the first
[33:54] time they would be thinking of son of
[33:56] God and I said even the Bible says that
[34:02] when who was it the three Hebrew
[34:05] children throw the fiery furnace and in
[34:07] the Nebuchadnezzar come forth and said I
[34:10] see four and said one of them's like
[34:13] unto the Son of God but I said then I
[34:20] said didn't I we would would we worry
[34:22] about son of man until we understand the
[34:26] form our way of dealing with son of God
[34:30] and that's it all of your riders your
[34:34] theologians and things will go back into
[34:38] Genesis and you write you reach Cofield
[34:42] and it's footnotes which is great and
[34:45] that that first form that came out of
[34:49] God was called a son of God now then see
[34:58] we think we get it all figured out now
[35:01] I'll ask the question this way when we
[35:06] reference with the name Jesus we will
[35:11] show these things as we go along
[35:13] when the reference comes with an named
[35:15] Jesus what do you think of the Bible II
[35:22] shape of a form of a man that walked on
[35:26] the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago
[35:31] and we called him Jesus why do we need
[35:39] to know this you sound like you make
[35:41] things so complicated I try to make it
[35:51] simple
[35:52] you're the ones making it complicated by
[35:56] not just plainly listening and getting
[35:58] away from all of your thoughts and just
[36:02] listening don't you see what I'm talking
[36:05] about this morning
[36:07] the Bible makes a report
[36:10] Isaiah made a report
[36:17] 52 chapters he spoke of the Messiah
[36:21] spoke of all the time folk of the world
[36:23] spoke of the coming vocal John the
[36:25] Baptist spoke of all those things and
[36:28] then is it said who had believed I
[36:32] report report that he'd made heard all
[36:35] the prophets up to that time because
[36:39] that's what the prophets were doing
[36:40] making a report from God to mankind
[36:43] about God and trying to tell us about
[36:46] him and they did then Isaiah says now
[36:51] I'm going to make a report and the
[36:55] report he made broke Jesus Christ right
[36:58] to Calvary to the beating to where you
[37:01] didn't want to look at him in all things
[37:05] and describing it right down to that
[37:08] point and he made a report you know what
[37:11] had happened that way the report was
[37:14] right right
[37:18] see can we make a report after all of
[37:22] the years that we studied the message
[37:25] why is there so much confusion but it's
[37:29] the same thing as it was and when I was
[37:31] adamant in the denominations and the
[37:33] Baptist to ask questions of people and
[37:38] wandering out of one Bible how they
[37:42] could be and I didn't know the number
[37:43] amount of how many there was but there
[37:46] was 969 at least denomination probably
[37:50] about the time I was saying that
[37:51] according to what the Prophet said out
[37:56] of 969 you had at least 500 different
[38:00] interpretations or thoughts some of them
[38:04] were overlaid each other you know about
[38:08] God out of one Bible you got one
[38:15] prophets message you're not supposed to
[38:20] put out a book for the two souls
[38:23] believers this message it only has two
[38:25] soul doctrines written in it so let the
[38:30] others put out a MOOC and on to Lourdes
[38:34] or any kind of ideal I thought it was
[38:40] one message I thought they and I
[38:42] appreciate them at voice of God
[38:44] recordings to try to be so specific
[38:46] about trying to make sure everything is
[38:50] worded the way the Prophet said it
[38:55] without a one message we wind up with
[38:58] all of these thoughts and ideas what
[39:02] about it what about simply the name of
[39:07] God like I said you said what it's name
[39:11] is God
[39:12] I guess we just go home know that that's
[39:18] as far as your mind goes my mind will
[39:20] forget it you come to Genesis 1 and I
[39:27] think it's 33 times if you use the name
[39:31] God God created heaven the earth God
[39:34] created is my created act got great
[39:36] animals it's about 33
[39:38] times 32 33 times you use the name God
[39:45] well what about it - let's ask the
[39:52] Prophet a question as the name of the
[39:59] Lord changed in different dispensations
[40:09] we asked him I like to ask see I like
[40:12] that's the Prophet let him answer it
[40:14] don't you
[40:16] woof the questions and answers realtor
[40:19] in 1964 paragraph 137 138 it has the
[40:26] name of the Lord changed in the
[40:28] different dispensation yes yes it was
[40:35] once called he was called the I am
[40:43] he's called Jehovah and he's changed
[40:48] many times the last time it was changed
[40:57] was when God became flesh and took a
[41:01] human name Jehovah I am and all of those
[41:11] are titles to a name if you would
[41:18] baptize in the name of Jehovah it had to
[41:21] be the name of Jesus Christ if you would
[41:26] baptize in the name of Jehovah right by
[41:28] Jove with the Nasus genre all those is
[41:34] how to be Jesus Christ the I am is Jesus
[41:40] Christ that is Jesus say that when he
[41:44] talking to him he said before Abraham
[41:45] was I am
[41:49] right
[41:52] now what I'm wanting to get to is just
[41:56] to go through the Old Testament if we
[41:57] get to it this evening to try to bring
[42:01] up the titles in their relationship and
[42:06] what I want you to remember is one thing
[42:13] we'll it started out as an illustration
[42:15] of brother Branham of Elohim then we'll
[42:20] go to Jehovah moving on what I want you
[42:23] to remember is one thing God may change
[42:30] in the meaning of titles who reference
[42:35] to his name but God don't change I think
[42:42] that's according to Malachi 3 in it
[42:44] where he said I'm God and I changed not
[42:50] all right so then you're not going to
[42:53] say take this name and try to take this
[42:56] name and see that he changed no you're
[43:03] going to see that you take this name and
[43:07] then when it changes in this name comes
[43:10] into view it's a further look or
[43:13] advancement or the revelation of the one
[43:16] true and living God now you're following
[43:20] me because you got to combine them and
[43:28] you see where we're going to be slow
[43:29] when we get into the Godhead you've got
[43:33] to combine all of the titles before you
[43:38] can say Jesus you can't leave out any
[43:43] titles and come to the name Jesus why
[43:50] are you reading here to save us
[43:51] that's what somebody told you in
[43:59] - so keep that little thought in your
[44:01] mind to see God the titles down truth
[44:08] the Old Testament form as he changes the
[44:12] way he deals with man that is God not
[44:17] changing but the way he's dealing is
[44:21] changing but that you cannot to say well
[44:24] we don't need this anymore
[44:30] now I quote it let's see unveiling God
[44:34] the run said let me read you John 1:1 he
[44:40] said in the beginning without him
[44:42] Elohim was without him and Elohim was
[44:45] tell him and said el ahem we've made
[44:48] flesh and dwelt among us and has a
[44:52] problem did you have any trouble using
[44:56] Java but just remember now don't ever do
[45:05] away with anything
[45:06] a further advancement of Revelation is
[45:10] based entirely upon your foundation of
[45:14] where you started
[45:16] he's like Martin Luther as much as I say
[45:19] on that you ought to know it Martin
[45:21] Luther started to just you live by faith
[45:23] but we're above that now we don't need
[45:27] that no more we're going on out you're
[45:30] you going on out all right John Wesley
[45:39] stood on the new birth of what he
[45:41] thought for his day and started a
[45:44] message called sanctification he never
[45:47] rejected Luther's message he brought the
[45:51] message of sanctification the
[45:54] Pentecostals stood on Luther's message
[45:58] in Wesley's message and the Holy Ghost
[46:01] came had they not stood on it it would
[46:03] not have followed it that's how Stern
[46:07] I'll make it read understand he's not
[46:10] doing away
[46:12] if looking at the way God is revealing
[46:15] himself for you and I to understand now
[46:22] who in a peanut brain of mankind can
[46:25] comprehend an eternal God I mean a God
[46:37] that created everything
[46:41] Oh God that at one time according to his
[46:48] titles was self-existing which means
[46:54] nothing existed with him not a NAT not a
[47:00] bat not a bird or anything and not a
[47:03] human being
[47:05] existing with him or his title would be
[47:07] wrong you see that's the way I love the
[47:13] answer because the people of this
[47:15] message are great to put forth a lot on
[47:17] predestination I was back dire where I
[47:24] got to probably I'm back down the very
[47:29] first title of self-existing does away
[47:35] with any existence of mankind as mortals
[47:40] at parks or whatever we are because that
[47:45] he was self existing then nobody existed
[47:49] with him I like your way Brett a random
[47:53] citizen cuz he makes the marvelous
[47:55] statements you know that you just you
[47:58] really you just have to take it for what
[48:01] it says one day he was talking about God
[48:06] and talking about eternal and he said in
[48:08] the beginning before the eternal now
[48:16] they no human mind can comprehend that
[48:19] statement
[48:22] the interning to go just as far that
[48:25] away is it goes that away it has no
[48:28] beginning and no ending and yet God
[48:31] existed before eternity that's the point
[48:39] in it but yeah we think we got it over
[48:42] lady's name God so just remember the
[48:55] Prophet said has the name of the Lord
[48:58] changed in different dispensation he
[49:04] said yes yes it was once called he was
[49:08] called the I am
[49:09] he's called Jehovah and he's changed
[49:13] many times the life time it was changed
[49:18] was when God became flesh and took a
[49:24] human name all of those others Jehovah
[49:29] Elohim you know all of those are just
[49:34] titles to a name it's like father son
[49:37] Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost is not
[49:39] a knight right he's got a name his
[49:44] father that's a title to a name that's
[49:48] an expression or something it is not a
[49:51] name he said well that sure was I'm a
[49:55] father
[49:55] well I don't like to be nasty but I like
[49:58] to be straight you know the Bible says
[50:00] to call no man father what it says don't
[50:07] call no man father now you know the
[50:09] Bible's not saying don't call your daddy
[50:12] father he's calling telling you don't
[50:15] call no man father
[50:22] big group of people got a whole lot of
[50:23] father you know you know what I mean
[50:25] okay
[50:28] you're good little Catholic you say
[50:30] father all the time don't you father
[50:31] didn't bother them that's the kind that
[50:34] the Bible is saying don't call no man
[50:37] father don't make nobody above God are
[50:42] you winning it all right
[50:46] but God has many titles to his name and
[50:51] as we come down through using those
[50:55] titles I hope you follow a pattern that
[50:59] is not using a name and then
[51:01] annihilating all the other with the next
[51:04] time it'll be used as another title but
[51:07] it'll have another reference added onto
[51:09] that title which is the same one
[51:15] Scofield leaving in his footnote you
[51:17] know you say well I don't like Scofield
[51:20] well that's alright we'll just read
[51:22] brother Branham so the you know you like
[51:24] him let's go filling these footnotes is
[51:28] covering Ella him Jehovah and he said
[51:32] from that we defies the name H of H AV
[51:36] EA 8 and he says by that then we develop
[51:43] his name to be Jehovah like I told your
[51:54] witness one time I said I'm a better
[51:56] Jehovah Witness and you are he said you
[51:59] are IC al I said because the me that you
[52:02] over the old Jesus of the new boy here
[52:05] this and this young guy was with him he
[52:07] said I never heard that you know he's
[52:09] willing to talk the old guy said let's
[52:11] go let's go he's getting him away but I
[52:16] said have you never read the Bible and
[52:18] we just read it to you
[52:20] jover witnesses I'm not against them
[52:23] that's their business right which I'm
[52:24] about right here let your whole the
[52:27] witness that's the Jehovah they use that
[52:29] and we just read to you in proverbs
[52:32] 18:10 that he was known by the name of
[52:35] Almighty God
[52:36] but said by my name Jehovah I was never
[52:40] known unto them that's what I asked him
[52:46] and I said why do you call him Jehovah
[52:49] when he said he was never known by that
[52:57] he was known by jvh you all right now
[53:01] you're gonna go with a couple of things
[53:02] so just flop all you want to brother
[53:05] amuses jvh musings a VHD he said well
[53:11] this is resetar
[53:12] it's one of them too but there's no way
[53:16] to pronounce that there's not a
[53:21] pronunciation I'm not an English major
[53:26] but you'd have to add some things to be
[53:28] able to pronounce that I don't know
[53:32] where you call them BIOS or whatever you
[53:34] call them or consonants is evolved jvh
[53:38] you you got to add something to it to be
[53:42] able to pronounce it so they added
[53:45] letters to it and pronounced it as
[53:48] Jehovah now like I was saying we said
[53:55] well what God's name is God will how
[53:58] come he says jehovah is his name over
[54:01] here we're reading a minute where he
[54:07] said Joel was at night but then we're
[54:11] reading what we read to start with that
[54:13] by my name jehovah's i never no no see
[54:16] they never understood I'm trying to get
[54:20] us to look at one thing for certainty it
[54:24] will get away from our old ideas and
[54:26] thoughts the Bible opens up to become a
[54:31] beautiful book that you can just study
[54:34] it and roll and just think about the
[54:37] things that's being said and how
[54:39] wonderful because we remembers we will
[54:42] get to in the godhead series that we're
[54:45] starting pretty quick
[54:48] that remember it is the condescending of
[54:51] God to reveal himself and one of the
[55:00] meanings where you add Elohim Jehovah in
[55:06] hava comes out to be Jehovah which it
[55:10] means the one who existed alone is now
[55:16] revealing himself that's one of the
[55:22] thoughts the one who existed alone is
[55:25] now revealing himself who took communion
[55:32] right all right now let's start and see
[55:38] what we got so we go to Genesis 1 as I
[55:43] said we read in Genesis 1 32 or 33 times
[55:48] that it uses the name g.o.d if you look
[55:55] at that in your Scofield Bible verifies
[55:57] the way that I talk now not ever
[55:59] translation doesn't do it but a lot of
[56:02] them the biggest portion do when you
[56:05] have a small case letter word it has a
[56:10] different form of meaning or thought
[56:12] than when you do when you capitalize
[56:14] that word if it no it's just the start
[56:22] of a sentence well then you explain to
[56:26] me why they didn't John 5:24 I believe
[56:30] it is says God is a spirit and that uses
[56:34] a small case or middle case which one
[56:36] you want to use smaller case g.od you
[56:41] say well let's just start the sentence
[56:43] well why didn't it start the sentence
[56:44] for the capital form he said what about
[56:47] us okay Hebrews let one woman says God
[56:51] created and that's upper case
[56:59] the bigger case gone you know what I
[57:01] mean lowercase s G Oh reverse D
[57:06] uppercase is G big
[57:09] Oh Big D big you know birth all these
[57:16] things with wrote around them to where
[57:17] you'll see it when it talks of him being
[57:20] his god and then when he created man he
[57:26] said Lord God
[57:36] it has the meaning of understanding to
[57:40] try to express what's being saying you
[57:45] don't have to have all of this jumbled
[57:48] up as you think I do
[57:52] but just get what I'm talking about Pro
[57:58] Dyer in Genesis one throughout the
[58:01] entire chapter even to the making of man
[58:03] in 1:26 and 27 it still uses the
[58:07] lowercase of God because if you listen
[58:11] to this you'll see and I love it so much
[58:14] you read your Bible with this thought in
[58:16] mind read it and watch when it'll say
[58:19] Lord God when that lowercase G or
[58:25] whatever or lowercase L when it's dire
[58:30] Remini
[58:31] it means God is here talking to us but
[58:39] when it's up in the upper case it means
[58:42] the God of heaven and if you'll take
[58:45] what I read about Cyrus the King to the
[58:53] building of the temple if you read that
[58:56] in Ezra 1 you will see and it uses the
[59:02] italicized letter of Lord that King
[59:05] recognized that God of heaven told him
[59:08] to build a house it's wonderful if we
[59:12] get it in the right way and it will come
[59:13] out the right understanding but get the
[59:16] point
[59:16] it's telling him all right so we start
[59:20] off we're trying to understand God and
[59:22] we can only use the terminologies that
[59:25] mankind is used to express it and it's
[59:28] the word Elohim now go ahead to number 2
[59:42] but with unused number woman go ahead
[59:43] number two which is a mighty garden bio
[59:46] before us in the beginning
[59:49] he wasn't even God now our English word
[59:53] God God means an object of worship how
[59:57] confusing it is to the mind you can make
[1:00:00] somebody of God you can make anything of
[1:00:02] God but in the Old Testament in Genesis
[1:00:04] 1 in the beginning God it is used Elohim
[1:00:08] Elohim means the self the existing one
[1:00:13] what a difference between the word
[1:00:16] Elohim is 2 our word God Elohim means
[1:00:20] the self existing one all right self
[1:00:27] existing means he existed alone nobody
[1:00:34] wouldn't with him he created angels but
[1:00:39] then there was with him nothing was dark
[1:00:43] and he himself with you this you're just
[1:00:45] making him with you know we just well
[1:00:50] you won't explain
[1:00:54] I'm not sarcastic rightful I'll let you
[1:00:58] explain it women are whatnot but all you
[1:01:04] can do is use words and terminology to
[1:01:08] speak to human mankind
[1:01:11] so the first thoughts is self existing
[1:01:16] the one who existed alone nothing with
[1:01:22] him not no second person or third person
[1:01:27] to share things with because he ain't no
[1:01:30] second person or third person it's
[1:01:33] revealing one crew and living God it
[1:01:41] could not be pronounced back dire as to
[1:01:45] say in the beginning Jesus created the
[1:01:51] heavens and the earth
[1:01:57] they didn't how the language in the end
[1:01:59] to come into name Jesus yet that four
[1:02:02] thousand years later but that would not
[1:02:06] have been confusing to mankind remember
[1:02:10] the Bible is written that the wise and
[1:02:11] prudent cannot understand it but the
[1:02:16] simple can that can be revealed to them
[1:02:19] i right now nothing against education
[1:02:24] I'm using it right now to prove the
[1:02:26] point so the word is Elohim the self
[1:02:33] existing one he groped totally alone
[1:02:42] nobody with him nothing there but God
[1:02:46] himself
[1:02:47] you can't go no further than that what
[1:02:53] could you use any other name to
[1:02:55] reference something back Pais
[1:02:58] self-existing you can't you can't do it
[1:03:04] so you use it and the theologians used
[1:03:06] it and it came up with it because it
[1:03:09] would read it out of their scrolls and
[1:03:11] done and they knew that that meant a
[1:03:14] specific time so they said okay this is
[1:03:17] LAN this is self-existing you know until
[1:03:25] God created man putting a few things
[1:03:29] ahead were to be interesting to you
[1:03:31] until God created man in Genesis 1:26
[1:03:34] and 27 he was self existing
[1:03:44] the animals even though they came into
[1:03:47] creation there are not part of God their
[1:03:53] creation even the Angels created beings
[1:03:59] but not a part of God so until you get
[1:04:03] to Genesis 1:26 and 27 don't even
[1:04:06] consider him to be anything other than
[1:04:09] self existing because there's nothing
[1:04:12] existing with him
[1:04:14] that is like him now remember remember
[1:04:20] Genesis 1:26 and 27 he's still dealing
[1:04:28] adela himself existing because they
[1:04:31] ain't no human elements Dyer we will get
[1:04:37] to that later
[1:04:38] there's no human elements Genesis 2:7 he
[1:04:42] creates man or two six I'm ready he
[1:04:45] creates a physical man - until man time
[1:04:53] came into being now listen to what I'm
[1:04:55] getting at until Jesus Christ came on
[1:04:58] earth and human flesh would be the first
[1:05:02] time that the name of God could really
[1:05:06] develop in human now come on get the
[1:05:14] right story the name of Jesus was never
[1:05:17] pronounced right get the right story
[1:05:23] well the name of Jesus is never
[1:05:25] pronounce you mean they never nobody
[1:05:26] ever said Jesus now I'll quote brother
[1:05:29] Branham with you okay
[1:05:30] but around said there were plenty of
[1:05:31] Jesus's in the days of Jesus there were
[1:05:36] plenty of people called Jesus there are
[1:05:40] plenty of people today called Jesus hey
[1:05:42] is it hazers in Spanish
[1:05:50] it doesn't mean when he say the first
[1:05:52] time it's spoken by human lips the name
[1:06:03] of Jesus a baby received life in the
[1:06:06] womb that name had been used many many
[1:06:11] many many many times before then all the
[1:06:13] way down through but it never referred
[1:06:18] to the right person
[1:06:20] nothing so it didn't make no difference
[1:06:23] that's why brother Branham would say you
[1:06:26] can call him Jesus Jesus and won't get
[1:06:29] nothing yet he said ask anything in my
[1:06:34] name but then as long as you're dealing
[1:06:43] with up to Genesis 1 through there
[1:06:46] you're dealing with self-existing he has
[1:06:50] created animals has created the world
[1:06:52] has created light moon stars create off
[1:06:55] and he still self-existing he creates
[1:06:59] man in 1:26 27 he still self existing
[1:07:06] then he creates man in Genesis to get
[1:07:12] your Bibles and look if you got any form
[1:07:15] of a Scofield or any type of Bible that
[1:07:18] is to amount very much it'll say in
[1:07:20] Genesis 2 let's just read it I didn't
[1:07:25] put a lot of these up they can pull them
[1:07:28] if they want to
[1:07:35] it's used as Genesis 1:26 all of it I'm
[1:07:41] in Genesis 1 to 28 it is used as God and
[1:07:47] read your Bible and you read in Genesis
[1:07:51] 2 they start talking it said God with
[1:07:55] the same small form our note blessed the
[1:07:58] seventh day and sanctified it because in
[1:08:01] it he had rested from all his work which
[1:08:04] God created and made these are the
[1:08:09] generations of heaven the heavens and of
[1:08:12] the earth when they were created in the
[1:08:15] day that the Lord God what do you want
[1:08:21] to capitalize it whatever you want to do
[1:08:23] all that is just a reference to
[1:08:26] understand you got it right there in
[1:08:28] front of you the word God is used if you
[1:08:32] roll it down to verse 2 or 3 God and God
[1:08:36] blessed the seventh day that's still
[1:08:39] self-existing now roll up now which what
[1:08:43] do we got immediately in Genesis 2 as
[1:08:46] man starts to come into being is
[1:08:49] physical it goes to Lord God and then
[1:08:57] when you get on over to verse 7 believe
[1:09:00] us right yeah
[1:09:01] verse 7 it says the Lord God formed man
[1:09:06] didn't say God formed man said the Lord
[1:09:11] God that's what I said it didn't matter
[1:09:15] about you want to listen to me about
[1:09:16] capitalization of these things or that
[1:09:18] uh read your Bible he said Lord God so
[1:09:26] that means something happened the self
[1:09:30] existing one it existed in Chapter one
[1:09:35] creating world and all the things in man
[1:09:39] inner spiritual condition he's still
[1:09:42] alone himself existing when you come to
[1:09:44] Genesis 2 he's Lord God which means
[1:09:47] Jehovah Elohim
[1:09:53] remember the statement and we'll get
[1:09:55] back to it later then when you start
[1:09:57] using jehovah you're going to come to a
[1:10:01] primary meaning that will say the self
[1:10:04] existing one that existed alone begins
[1:10:10] to reveal himself then think about it
[1:10:19] the self existing one that existed alone
[1:10:25] and you know that when he created man in
[1:10:29] a physical state he will never be self
[1:10:35] existing again he's a self existing one
[1:10:39] yeah but he'll never Cottle a self
[1:10:42] existing because once he created man he
[1:10:45] had something in his own image that
[1:10:49] simple something in his own image
[1:10:53] man animals not in this image so then he
[1:11:00] goes to Jehovah and watch it the minute
[1:11:02] Jehovah will come to a finality of
[1:11:05] meaning a father with his family when he
[1:11:14] created physical man on the earth and
[1:11:16] brought him into being he will never be
[1:11:18] accepted system anymore he'll be the
[1:11:24] self existing one that now exists with
[1:11:26] his family but his name was Java
[1:11:38] so then we're coming down go ahead to
[1:11:42] number four let's get that go to this
[1:11:45] attributes have to lay these out for you
[1:11:49] to understand and be able to follow me
[1:11:51] and then to when we get around at a
[1:11:53] while if we don't today I'll try to
[1:11:55] correct it by Windsor there's one sheet
[1:11:56] in y'all's notes it's mr. okay old age
[1:12:02] go to message adoption
[1:12:05] he said Genesis the first chapter 126
[1:12:09] when God called his name Lord God it's
[1:12:13] in the word él ella ella hem which means
[1:12:18] herself existing one I watch him there
[1:12:21] was nothing else existed with him there
[1:12:25] was no hair there was no light there was
[1:12:26] no starter in the world there was no
[1:12:28] nothing else it was God and God alone
[1:12:30] lol ahem now that made now what's inside
[1:12:34] of that was attributes inside of him
[1:12:36] we'll get back to these which meant that
[1:12:39] he was inside of this great lll ahem was
[1:12:43] an attribute you know what an attribute
[1:12:45] is are let's say like this was a nature
[1:12:48] so that's the little fella will show
[1:12:51] that they'll get it and I wanted little
[1:12:52] fellers has to get it that way inside of
[1:12:55] him was the nature to be a father but he
[1:13:00] was self existent there ain't nothing
[1:13:04] for him to be a father by and now down
[1:13:08] inside of that was something else that
[1:13:10] was called God and God is an object of
[1:13:12] worship but he was self existent LLO him
[1:13:17] Ella him regard was nothing to worship
[1:13:19] him inside of him was to be a savior he
[1:13:25] dull him self exists him
[1:13:27] there's a time he self-existing he has
[1:13:30] his college now say it this way he saw a
[1:13:36] man in the garden and according read
[1:13:38] around him and he saw a man in the
[1:13:41] garden without even he said man was
[1:13:45] lonely
[1:13:49] in God in the beginning was lonely that
[1:13:56] he wanted something to exist with he was
[1:14:05] self-existing so he wanted something to
[1:14:07] exist with so what did he do then he was
[1:14:15] still self existing for a long time
[1:14:18] nothing existed before him go down to
[1:14:22] number seven thank the city do we use
[1:14:25] out Big Wednesday when God made they
[1:14:30] called him LLL ahem L owe him nothing
[1:14:33] existed before him and he was all the
[1:14:36] existence that there ever was
[1:14:37] self-existence one Ellen Ellen Parker
[1:14:40] but in Genesis two when he made man he
[1:14:43] said I am why aah-ooh juv you H yeah
[1:14:50] Hugh Jehovah then what you what did it
[1:14:57] mean
[1:14:57] I am the all existent one who has
[1:15:02] created something off of myself to be a
[1:15:06] son of mine the Genesis true them Old
[1:15:12] Glory Lang game Angela means that he
[1:15:15] gave man to be an amateur God because he
[1:15:21] is father God and he made a man an
[1:15:23] amateur God so he isn't Seth existent
[1:15:27] anymore he exists with his family amen
[1:15:30] LLL ahem now he is Jehovah Jehovah
[1:15:34] meaning the one who exists with his
[1:15:37] family Schofield said the same thing
[1:15:41] there's probably or other I'm got it
[1:15:43] from I'm giving you that the scholars
[1:15:46] knew that the darks brother branham
[1:15:49] saying it when it comes to Jehovah he
[1:15:52] comes out to be the one who exists with
[1:15:55] his family because he created man in
[1:15:58] Genesis 2 he come down in the garden to
[1:16:00] fellowship with man right
[1:16:04] and he was Jehovah no longer
[1:16:08] self-existing so now your title in him
[1:16:17] tell him Jehovah the self-existent God
[1:16:23] that one time existed alone now has
[1:16:27] brought his family of mankind into being
[1:16:30] and he will no longer be listed only as
[1:16:34] Elohim he will be listed in going
[1:16:38] through your Bible you see one comma
[1:16:39] where it continually says Lord Lord Lord
[1:16:42] Lord Lord God Lord God Lord God so he
[1:16:46] doesn't go back to being self existing
[1:16:50] so then when you see it your whole life
[1:16:54] you see one who exists with his family
[1:17:01] thank you but think about it for the
[1:17:08] number-8 who you exceeded he'll stay
[1:17:12] Jehovah throughout the Old Testament
[1:17:19] those he's with his family well let's
[1:17:25] see we got number eight going down to
[1:17:27] number that's what I'm saying we mess it
[1:17:30] up some more book will go and Moses said
[1:17:33] unto God which is Exodus 13 15 and Moses
[1:17:37] said unto God
[1:17:38] this is coming on over to Moses right
[1:17:42] you remember where he's at
[1:17:47] saying to them the god of your father's
[1:17:50] has sent me unto you and they shall say
[1:17:53] to me
[1:17:54] this is Moses at the burning bush right
[1:17:58] and they will say unto me what is his
[1:18:03] name what shall I say unto them and God
[1:18:11] said unto Moses I am that I am
[1:18:17] what didn't hate what is it's not users
[1:18:21] it's over why is it not used as
[1:18:28] Ellingham
[1:18:29] why is it not used as you oh well ahem
[1:18:35] what is the name of God I am that I am
[1:18:44] you know I did Jesus come along before
[1:18:47] Abraham was I am God sending emotion I
[1:18:54] am that I am he said I shall say unto
[1:18:57] the children of Israel I am hath sent me
[1:19:00] unto you
[1:19:02] you're going down reading and you'll get
[1:19:05] into it maybe here in this part yeah
[1:19:07] here it is the God of Abraham the god of
[1:19:10] Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me unto
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:17] in other words Moses goes down and he
[1:19:20] says the God of Abraham we got of Isaac
[1:19:22] the God of Jacob has sent me they said
[1:19:26] we know who Abraham was we know who
[1:19:28] Isaac was we know who Jacob was but who
[1:19:31] are you
[1:19:37] but what name is this one that you talk
[1:19:40] to in the bush and remember it wouldn't
[1:19:44] written out in the bush I am that I am
[1:19:48] there was a name appeared or a thought
[1:19:52] or a concept or a title and he said I am
[1:19:57] it means I am that I am lets you
[1:20:05] God centered more moreover unto Moses
[1:20:08] dot the shield I say unto the children
[1:20:09] of Israel the Lord God of your father's
[1:20:11] the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the
[1:20:13] God of Jacob has sent me unto you this
[1:20:16] is my name forever and this is my
[1:20:23] memorial unto all generations what a
[1:20:29] night but when the scholars wrote it out
[1:20:35] or what the ones that wrote it all that
[1:20:39] could ride is what it meant this is my
[1:20:44] name forever you know its name today if
[1:20:51] I am that I am you sure that's not a
[1:21:02] name
[1:21:12] Jesus that I am that I am he didn't use
[1:21:17] I am that I am he said before Abraham
[1:21:20] was I am
[1:21:24] you'll find in the book of Acts it says
[1:21:27] Jesus spoke to Moses from the burning
[1:21:31] bush are you with me so I can call out
[1:21:37] that Scripture I got them oh I am done
[1:21:40] releasing a lot of it but in the book of
[1:21:42] Acts it said book Jesus spoke to Moses
[1:21:45] I'm a commotion in the burning bush he
[1:21:48] was the angel of the Lord remember what
[1:21:51] Moses and when it says about this
[1:21:53] burning bush
[1:21:54] it says the angel of the Lord spoken to
[1:21:57] Moses who was that I angel of the Lord
[1:22:00] it was the Lord Jesus Christ before the
[1:22:07] name Jesus came into being we call him
[1:22:12] that I am that I am that name for
[1:22:17] heaven's sakes don't try to do away with
[1:22:19] that we don't believe in your way we
[1:22:23] don't believe in Joel will it do what
[1:22:25] you want that we just don't leave this
[1:22:29] just don't lose that I am because you
[1:22:32] know what it means it means a prophet
[1:22:36] gives the interpretation
[1:22:38] it means ever-present for eternity
[1:22:45] that's what I am that I am mean
[1:22:49] ever-present for eternity he'll never
[1:22:53] lose that part he never loses Jehovah
[1:22:58] because he right now is Jehovah with his
[1:23:02] family he never lost L owe him my
[1:23:11] brother branham as I said you can say
[1:23:14] this is the way you read John 1:1 in the
[1:23:17] beginning with L ahem hello him was with
[1:23:20] him and Ella him was Ella him oh no it
[1:23:23] says in the beginning was guard to guard
[1:23:24] with garden
[1:23:26] he's showing the self-existing one he's
[1:23:30] showing the one who wanted this stood
[1:23:32] alone is now in human flesh go ahead

[1:23:41] you won't forget it he's talking about
[1:23:43] the I am that I am and I am was not
[1:23:46] yesterday Nakamura
[1:23:48] it's ever-present the same I am in every
[1:23:52] age in every generation or eternity is

[1:24:22] up mister minute he was called your home
[1:24:25] in the Old Testament not but get the
[1:24:33] point to where just run through this go
[1:24:37] to number 11 Psalms 83 18 it men they
[1:24:45] know that thou whose name alone is
[1:24:52] Jehovah are the most high over all of
[1:24:58] the earth they could call him Jehovah

[1:25:51] jehovah right got the Old Testament
[1:25:53] George George over tsking you a woman a
[1:25:56] sherbet the seven come down names of
[1:25:58] Jehovah in the Bible the Old Testament
[1:26:02] and if he's George our which is our
[1:26:05] salvation then who's Jesus Christ I
[1:26:09] thought he was our salvation okay
[1:26:16] look at Isaiah 26 and for trusting in
[1:26:21] the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah
[1:26:22] is everlasting strength and where you
[1:26:28] can't become but then why would he say
[1:26:34] but I'll have to end it with this talk
[1:26:39] but why would he say it we read Exodus 6
[1:26:44] God spoken to Moses and said unto him I
[1:26:47] am the Lord now if you're done to
[1:26:53] Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob by
[1:26:56] the name of God Almighty but by my name
[1:27:03] Jehovah was I not known to them why
[1:27:17] we're reading here what was back tire
[1:27:21] we're reading with educational
[1:27:24] understanding of words and dollars in a
[1:27:28] profits definition and we can talk about
[1:27:32] elohim Jehovah Yahweh's and all that he
[1:27:38] said by not my name is Jehovah you mind
[1:27:43] putting it this way by my name JV hu
[1:27:47] I was never known cause no vowels to
[1:27:57] pronounce it so they added the vowels
[1:28:00] and they pronounce it you over that was
[1:28:04] not the name
[1:28:09] what about it let's read a couple in it
[1:28:13] I'll quit I got to read these then we
[1:28:16] get it read number 15 which is God keeps
[1:28:18] his word job that God was still living
[1:28:25] and God had sent him and said go tell
[1:28:28] them that I am that sent you and I was
[1:28:31] or I will be I am a present tense he is
[1:28:35] not I was claimed God that the depths of
[1:28:38] miracles the pious in the fight because
[1:28:40] you don't believe it right if he's I am
[1:28:42] he just as real as he was at the burning
[1:28:44] bush that great name that he appeared
[1:28:47] dark and no scholar yet has ever been
[1:28:53] able to interpret and he appeared at the
[1:28:59] burning bush he appeared as jvh you they
[1:29:06] can't pronounce it he said where they
[1:29:10] could be revealed you got to have
[1:29:14] something to connect it to where it's no
[1:29:17] good on your revelation they call it
[1:29:21] Jehovah but it wasn't no one can
[1:29:25] interpret it why the eternal one
[1:29:27] amen he dwells in the light he dwells in
[1:29:30] eternity he called immortality is
[1:29:32] everlasting I am lelou you he says going
[1:29:37] to make sure you'll see what I'm talking
[1:29:38] about go to 16 which is questions and
[1:29:41] answers on Hebrews alright now watch
[1:29:45] this first face there jesus said I am
[1:29:49] where Abraham was I am
[1:29:51] I am who was the I am there has never
[1:29:56] been a man in the world could interpret
[1:29:59] it even that you who read the lexer
[1:30:04] country so for there has never been a
[1:30:06] man who could make it out its jv8 you
[1:30:10] and even the Hebrew scholars could never
[1:30:14] pronounce it that burning bush died that
[1:30:17] day when he met with Moses it was jv8
[1:30:20] you so they pronounced it Jehovah but it
[1:30:27] isn't Jehovah jvh you no one knows
[1:30:32] that's why I said by my name jv8 you by
[1:30:35] my name Jehovah even though they called
[1:30:37] him Jehovah all the way down right he
[1:30:40] said you don't really understand the
[1:30:42] meaning of my name
[1:30:43] you're calling me Jehovah and that's
[1:30:46] acceptable for the time because it means
[1:30:49] a father with his family I said that's
[1:30:52] not my name he said I am sitting
[1:31:04] I like this one with 17 God's chosen
[1:31:09] place of worship 1965 now what is his 9
[1:31:15] first and once his point will have to

[1:31:22] can find out what it is he's putting in
[1:31:25] the place we got to find out his name
[1:31:31] before we can know a place that he to
[1:31:33] worship that's the whole message if
[1:31:35] you'll read the message if I can get the
[1:31:37] title of the message God's chosen place
[1:31:39] of worship got to find out where to put
[1:31:42] the night and he does what none of them
[1:31:45] were names to over j phi r fi java
[1:31:48] lily-of-the-valley the morning star all
[1:31:51] that but he has a name whenever at Moses
[1:31:55] look he had not a name yet and he told
[1:32:01] Moses I am that I am and when we see
[1:32:04] Jesus on earth speaking in in Hebrews
[1:32:07] the sixth chapter British st. John 6th
[1:32:11] chapter he said I am that I am no that's
[1:32:14] not yes I am it's not that I am written
[1:32:17] there in John why would a man over not
[1:32:21] over 50 years old and say that you seen
[1:32:23] Abraham he said before Abraham was I am
[1:32:27] and I am was the one the burning bush
[1:32:31] the pillar fire that was in the burning
[1:32:34] bush back in the days of Moses and I am
[1:32:39] the I am Jesus was declaring to be an
[1:32:45] access it as he was in the burning bush
[1:32:48] and spoke to Moses go read your Bible
[1:32:51] and John he was declaring that he was in
[1:32:54] that bush speaking to Moses he said I am
[1:32:58] I am give me a minute okay you get tied
[1:33:07] up into something I got about seven or
[1:33:09] eight pages left you're seeing what I
[1:33:11] had to throw away from this morning
[1:33:15] go to number 18 testimony of the razor
[1:33:19] the dead baby dead boy this is back in
[1:33:23] 53 and God told Moses he said now I'm
[1:33:27] going to send you mine angel before you
[1:33:29] to keep you in the way now anyone knows
[1:33:32] that that angel was Jesus Christ not
[1:33:38] Jesus the flesh Jesus the flesh was not
[1:33:44] in the burning bush I asked you a while
[1:33:47] ago when I say Jesus does your meaning
[1:33:50] go straight to the flesh Jesus never
[1:33:56] existed before the world now listen as a
[1:33:59] human flesh but he existed as Jesus
[1:34:02] Christ because Christ is the Angel of
[1:34:06] the Covenant anyone knows that I enjoy
[1:34:13] Jesus crush which was a fill of fire his
[1:34:18] name wasn't Jesus yet until he was
[1:34:20] manifested in flesh he didn't eat that
[1:34:26] you one more likely adoption which would
[1:34:31] be number 19 Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] is not no name of God God has one name
[1:34:46] in his name is Jesus the Bible said the
[1:34:54] family to heaven his name Jesus family
[1:34:58] and earth is named Jesus that's right
[1:35:00] God so God had one name human night he
[1:35:06] had a name called Jehovah Jireh Joe
[1:35:08] Bereta no titles but he had one 19 Jesus
[1:35:16] are you going into the one that's Jesus
[1:35:18] only I wish they would accept the truth
[1:35:22] I'd love to talk to him because of what
[1:35:26] I just said if you were listening
[1:35:29] Ellingham was God made manifest in one
[1:35:33] form which meant the self existing one
[1:35:37] moves over starts revealing himself to
[1:35:39] mankind in Genesis two he becomes Lord
[1:35:42] God Jehovah Elohim God who exists with
[1:35:46] his family down to the Old Testament
[1:35:49] here appears to man as the great
[1:35:53] Almighty God Jehovah they could call him
[1:35:59] out on him it's according to what they
[1:36:02] were referencing to but he said when he
[1:36:07] met Moses at the burning bush he said
[1:36:10] this is my name forever why don't we
[1:36:18] call him I am the I am we do when we
[1:36:22] call him Jesus and we know who is did
[1:36:26] you catch that when we know who he is is
[1:36:31] when we get what we ask him far but if
[1:36:36] not we're just saying Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:36:42] until we know who he is and what he's
[1:36:46] dealing with us we better keep Jesus I
[1:36:55] started off and I'll complete it by this
[1:36:59] everybody wants to know the new name the
[1:37:05] Prophet said on quote entry no Mandark
[1:37:08] conjure which means you try to figure it
[1:37:10] out he said it will be so great until
[1:37:15] they can't be questioned but you're not
[1:37:20] reading your Bible I'll make one
[1:37:25] statement to show you the reference the
[1:37:31] new name is mentioned in Revelations and
[1:37:35] I'll give him a new night that is to the
[1:37:40] six church age
[1:37:41] not the message to the seventh Ricci Bob
[1:37:48] filter Jays in the name is that the one
[1:37:51] who named living but he's dead man's
[1:37:54] loss is named sixer cage I'll write upon
[1:37:58] him my new ninety could we have already
[1:38:03] understood a lot more than we think
[1:38:07] about and unite but that's not important
[1:38:11] he said not important no because what
[1:38:15] good is it if we wanted to call him
[1:38:17] Charlie if we don't know why he's called
[1:38:18] Charlie there's no need to call him
[1:38:20] charlie
[1:38:21] right well I got his new name I like
[1:38:29] what happened when Tom a certain brother
[1:38:34] divorced his wife and married again and
[1:38:37] got him a young nice wife I reckon and
[1:38:39] younger and and she told him his new
[1:38:44] night she told him his new night old
[1:38:51] brother
[1:38:52] the Bible says that only he who would
[1:38:58] know himself

[1:39:03] you your new name you know you are the
[1:39:07] only one that could tell your new name
[1:39:09] and run around and said it could well be
[1:39:11] the name that was written in the Lamb's
[1:39:13] Book of Life okay but we're always
[1:39:15] worried about something this or that or
[1:39:17] the other to get a change that's why

[1:39:44] why we don't baptized in Jesus only

[1:40:09] no difference in using jehovah jireh
