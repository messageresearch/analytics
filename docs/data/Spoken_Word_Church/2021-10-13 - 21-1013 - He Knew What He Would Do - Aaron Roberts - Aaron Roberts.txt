the end of the world and you know you know sometimes i know y'all probably don't feel that way but you know a personal experience you know there's been times in my life i want to give up want to quit throw in the towel but you know there's something that keeps pulling you and where could you go in those times but to the lord and you know what i've never seen the time when you get so low you don't think you get any lower but you know he'll come to you and you know you find out he was there all the time he just that's right waiting for you to stop whatever you were doing and get out of and get out of his way many times we want to do things ourselves and we get in our own way we get into god's way but i'm so glad he's always there and the hour and the day that we live i'm so glad we have someone that we can turn to amen we're blessed people tonight so we're going to look in in the scripture look to the book of john chapter six we're gonna begin at verse one and we're gonna just speak to the author i know there's very many people that's been mentioned number sick and many needs but god's faithful in all things and he's the one that he said you know ask abundantly that your joy might be full so we can always go to him i mean let's just all pray before we read the scripture our heavenly father lord jesus we're just so thankful for lord this time to be in your house lord on

preeminence in the service bless each one we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen john chapter 6 beginning at verse 1 and it says after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the passover a feast of the jews was not when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat but this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do and that's where i got my title from he knew what he would do and philip answered him said 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples andrews simon peter's brother saith unto him there is a lad here which has five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten and those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did this is of a truth said this is of a truth that prophet that would come into the world and i believe that's deuteronomy 18 is this is the scripture where moses said that god would raise up a prophet like unto me he said when jesus therefore perceived it they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone amen god bless you tonight lord bless the reading of the word so just take a little phone he knew what he would do god always knows what he's going to do you know the good thing about god is he's never been caught off guard never been surprised you know he already knows what the end from the beginning so we don't ever have to worry about that is from the message the infallible proof of the resurrection brother brahm says and then what is a word is a thought expressed when god once thought how he would make the plan of redemption and how he redeemed man by foreknowledge knowing that some would desire it and some would be redeemed he thought of the plan and then when he spoke the word it was already a finished work in heaven when god spoke it we're told in the bible that jesus was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world we understand he wasn't slain really until four thousand years later but when god spoke the word it was a finished work when god spoke it he was slain back here at the foundation of the world when god foresaw and knew what he would do and he spoke the word it was finished right there and he said and give you a little courage which i find amongst the american christians that the great lack is is a fear the american christian seems to be afraid that god won't keep his word afraid if you just don't squeeze and hold or something it's nothing that you can do in the beginning it's what god has done said you never saw god though you thought you did but the bible claims you didn't no man seeks god his nature from the garden of eden proves that he's a coward and runs when he sins it wasn't god calling it wasn't adam calling god it was god calling adam and the bible says that you you might rest assure that your names were written on the land on the book of life your that your names were written on the book of life your names who are in the body of christ the night was written on the book of life before the foundation of the world that's what the bible said in revelations and he deceived all that dwelt upon the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world so when the lamb and god's great knowledge was slain here by his word at the beginning you were slain with him when the world first began so you know it gives us it gives assurance it's a it's a blessing to know where we come from and you know i just kept i just kept being drawn back to the scripture because you know it was so amazing that you know the the the multitude always followed jesus and always wanted to know you know where he was at and what was going on and you know when he when he went through there and and they were amazed because you know they had looked for a a one to fulfill this scripture that that moses had prophesied and all the other ones that we had uh talked about all the different prophecies that went forth and here he was in their midst and you know and and all of this you know god is always mindful of his people and here's jesus mindful of the of these people that that have been going and following him all this time but you know it was it's amazing that there you know when there's three things that stand out to me in this in this passage of scripture number one is you know he he begins to ask philip and has philip looking at this multitude and he turns to him and he says he said where are we going to find bread to feed all these people and he begins to have philip look and he said he done this to prove philip so philip what are you going to look well i'm going to look at this multitude well how far away from town and the first thing that the philip does is look at the finances 200 pennyworth is not going to buy a whole lot of bread when you got at least 5 000 men and you didn't counted the women and children right i mean you might get a crumb but you ain't gonna get nothing and so here's here's philip look at you know how we gonna do this you know there ain't no there's nothing that we we have in our midst that's gonna take care of this but you know he brings this but he brings this up to philip because he knew what he was going to do and number two when he begins to just talk to the disciples about this situation about feeding this multitude if he knew all things because if if you knew the beginning from the end and as we were talking about you know all things the whole plan the word was from the beginning god never had a new thought amen so he knew what was going to take place so when when they were standing there they were looking at this situation then you know that jesus already knew that andrew was going to find that little boy's lunch before before he even asked philip he knew where that little boy's lunch was but he turned and andrew got went and got this little boy's lunch because the disciples were out looking they're looking all around and jesus is speaking to them about about the needs of the multitude and they're turning around and looking at everything else and as they were looking around they were you know trying what are we going to do well then andrew finds that little boy's life well you know we found a little boy's lunch we got five little barley loaves and two fish and the first thing that philip that andrew says is what is this among so many we can go buy what little bread we can with the money we got but that ain't gonna do anything we find a little boy's lunch and that ain't gonna do anything but you know what they if they if they knew if they understood the situation they wouldn't be looking around trying to figure out trying to solve the problem themselves why because if they had their trust and and see if we put our trust in jesus christ then we're not looking at the situation as the disciples are but we turn to god and say you can do it whatever you say amen you know what we see jesus doing the first miracle is when mary comes to him and says they've run out of wine at the wedding and when he stands there and she comes to him and then he turn she turns to the servants and the ones around him and says whatever he says do do it you know she didn't go nowhere else she didn't try to come up with no idea the first thing she done was went to jesus and said hey this is the need this is the problem and you know jesus why are you coming to me but you know she didn't even she just turned and said listen whatever he says do do that and so you know jesus says well then go get the water pots and fill them full and so then they began to feel the water pots full and when they got them full then he said dip out and take to the governor of the feast that's right but see then then it's not looking and trying to figure out how we're going to solve this problem but the first thing he does is he tells them jesus tells the disciples make the men sit down so go sit down and let's look and when he sits down then he begins to distribute he took this one little boy's lunch and he begins to break and he began to pass through the disciples and they began to pass out and then when he began to pass out then it began to multiply that's right amen you know it's it's so it's so great because you know that's the type of the five-fold ministry because you know what we're not preaching our own word we're not preaching our own thoughts i would be daresome to stand here and try to preach anything that i thought i could do in my own self and anybody that thinks they can is very ignorant and arrogant amen amen because you know what the fifo ministry is called of god and gifted of god so if it so you know we're not trying to take the place of somebody because even the prophet had his position and god gave brother branham a position to be in and then when he came he done his part but you know he he said that he said that god would raise up young men that would carry this and sweep this on to the coming of the lord amen that's right you know brother branham never quit ordaining ministers so it's always been in the scripture god never took it out of the scripture so you know what that's god's divine order that's god's divine plan so it never did change so so when he began to break the word the the food to them and then he passed it on then you know what it said it then it said they ate till they were full amen the scripture the scripture says you know that they would eat all that they would want it he says as much as they would so you know nobody went hungry they ate all that they wanted and when they got done finished eating then they picked up the fragments he said no not let any not don't let any of it be lost and he filled up 12 baskets full and many times we look at things in in situations and we we wonder why things are the way that they are you know we get ourselves in the way but do we just turn to god and say listen we know what we i don't know what you're going to do but i know i know that you have the plan it's your plan so you know what i'm just going to get out of your way in the message the rapture brother branham says if god is infinite almighty all-powerful omnisci omnipresent omniscient why he knowed all things from the beginning so he note there's nothing out of cater it's just that we us that thinks it is it's everything run look back in his word see what he's doing then we'll have an understanding so you know when when things don't go the way we think they ought to go or we wonder why you know if you know it feels like sometimes it's us in the world and when i say us i don't mean like us as a group i'm talking about as an individual person when it feels like you in the world when it feels like me in the world when the devil likes to sit on your shoulder and talk to you and tell you you ain't got a friend in the world he wants to tell you how bad it is you know when brother branham you know was talking about when he lost his wife and he lost his daughter and going through that that hard time and sharon rose was dying and you know all that and the devil come to talk to him say well you know you've done all you've preached how good he was you preached that you know that he was a healer and he done all these different things and you've seen all these things take place and now he won't hear you but you know he did he was just like job you know he didn't approach him foolishly he didn't he didn't turn his back but you know because he said when i got ready to say and agree with him then the words came to me the words came to you know the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord god gives us situations and he takes care of them and we and it may not be the way we we ought to see it or you know but you know what we just walk by faith you know brother branham said he said now he said notice notice now another hey this is from perfect faith perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith master circumstance all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything you you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with see it masters the circumstance if it's in a room full of sickness and the lord's revealed that this certain thing's going to happen you just speak it and go on oh does just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going see it masters all circumstances well if you do this so-and-so is going to do that see it's already got it mastered see faith believes what god that believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it masters all circumstances we just put our trust in him you know we just put our our faith in what he will do when he spoke the word then whatever that situation is it'll come to pass we don't have we don't have to try to figure it out but you know what god will equip you in that situation to handle that situation amen one of the stories that come to me and i've preached on this number of years ago but i still sometimes i just i you know you think about stories that you've read and and things and you know it just stirs you up sometimes and i i i was thinking back to years ago when i i was singing i want to i preached on a message about an expected end an unexpected way to an expected end jeremiah god told jeremiah he wrote to he said that he would he said i know my thoughts to you he said of good not of evil he said that i will bring you to an expected end so all the things that he had wrote to the children of israel in the scripture he's referring back to that to the prophet jeremiah and he's telling the children of israel listen i know what i've said about you and i know what i thought about you and he said i'm going to bring you to this end i'm going to bring you to this place but you know he began to speak you know he told the children of israel to moses he said i'm going to take you to a land flowing with milk and honey your father abraham walked in this land and every place he put his foot it was his possession and you know god carried them over into that land and they began to see what god had done for them but you know what it was it was because of their faith it was not god but it was their faith that failed to take full possession of the land they couldn't drive out the enemy why because god god wasn't the one that failed them they failed themselves they failed to walk in the word that god had given to them the commission that god had given to them to drive the enemy out why because they begun to become play complacent in the land they began to just to mingle with the people that were in the land and they began to take on the ideas and the thoughts and and everything like that the culture of the world that they lived in and you know that became that became a thorn in their flesh the rest of their lives and all those years and then you know they were driven out of their homeland but you know what that that possession still belonged to the children of israel it still belonged to the descendants of abraham why because the word never changed their situation changed but it didn't give up god didn't broke his word and when the word came then it came time for them to go back to that homeland god made a way for them to go back back in the first world war they were the arabs had palestine and if you if you read mark twain wrote a a commentary on palestine and i read part of the last last time when i preached on it and you just just how horrible it was how pathetic and ju i mean you i mean there's there's no i mean when you read the old testament and you think about a land flowing with milk and honey and all these things and then when you see palestine it's like there's no way that that land is what god wrote about it's an absolute wasteland nobody would want that but you know in the first world war they were jews that took everything that they had everything that they could scrape up and they went over there and they wanted to buy part of that land and you know the arabs the only thing that the arabs would sell them over there was worthless just bearing wasteland that nobody else would want and they sold it to them for over three times the value of the land and the arabs the arabs laughed all the way to the bank said we we just just got over on all these jews look we took all our money them jews were standing there saying them arabs don't understand said we were willing to pay 10 times the value of the land why because those those jews when they went over there and they saw that land and they had never walked in that land before but when they began to walk in that land do you know that was the land that their father abraham had walked on and that was the first time the jews had stepped on that that was promised to them god promised that to them and there was no price too great that they wouldn't pay to walk on that land to walk in and take possession of it and there was this swampy land and it had it and it was just so poor and those people went over there and took this land and they were so happy and so thrilled and nobody else could see what they were excited about but they saw they saw the promise of god but nobody else saw that when those people were out there and they they didn't have any uh equipment they got out there with hand tools hand shovels and dug ditches and done everything and they got the water flowing so it wouldn't be stale and every one of them standing out there with malaria and i thought these people have lost their minds every one of them's almost dead and every day they'd get up they're elderly people they could barely walk but you know what they said this is our land this is god's this is god's promise to me and got out there digging [Music] but you know that was the first that was the first time that they had jews in in palestine at that time that they had actually taken possession of part of that land and you know everybody else so man those people are kooks but you know what there was something that was stirring up inside those people that this was the fulfillment of god's word and those people hung on and been ridiculed and scorned and all of the things that they had to face all time through that time up until the time that the british carved out a piece of land for the jews after world war ii when the when they divided the land and they cut off the portion there and they said this is palestine we're giving this to the jews and god began to tell the jews hey you can come home because after the second world war they did not have a homeland europe didn't want them everybody you know even american only could take so many and they didn't want the rest of them there's no place for them to go but god was fulfilling his word he cut off that portion of land over there and he began to send those people there and those people didn't want to get on planes as brother ram talked about they didn't want to get on planes they didn't want to do anything but he said he said listen he said our prophets have told us he said we're going to go home on the wings of eagles when they said are you going home to die i said no i'm going home to see the messiah one because they were rejoicing in what they saw nobody else saw that nobody else could believe that but they went over there and began to take this waste land this barren land and when they had when nobody else could do anything with it why because they were walking in the word of god and all of a sudden now you know they they've been able to turn that place into a lush garden in the middle of nowhere of all the things that they've been able to do but you know they saw something nobody else saw they didn't they didn't see they didn't see the wasteland and all those problems and everything like that they went home to see the messiah and many times you know if we face the word and we see the word and you know brother man said not for don't let us let the word become common to us but you know sometimes we can do that we can be just like that we can hear the word of god and see it and you know when the situation looks bad and it doesn't line up the way we want it to and everything like that but we don't look and say this is where god's going to meet us this is where god's going to bless us we don't see like they saw but you know what they begin to look and see this was this is what god had promised them and nobody else is going to say the world's not going to see this but it's but it's only to a chosen few it's not to the world there's many people you know no wonder people you know people have left this message about because it's the it's the time it's the time of the falling away they walked in this for so long but now it's time to leave why because they don't see the beauty in it amen one because isaiah said when he was speaking of jesus he said he said there was no beauty that they should desire him well they don't see no beauty they just see this ugly they say the hunter parts of the people they just see the ugliness of the word they don't see the beauty as brother brandon was telling the story about the about the young girl that you know she her mother had sent her off to school and you know she was riding the train back home when she when she pulled in there her mother was that had been burnt in the fire and you know the girls were making ridicule and said who is this ugly woman you know it embarrassed that girl she became embarrassed by what her mother the way her mother looked but you know when she got off the train her mother come to hug her and greet her and you know she just tr ignored her mother like she didn't know who she was but said the conductor on the train got a hold of that girl and told her said listen said i want you to know something said i remember when your mother was was way much beautiful than you are but she had love for you instead of letting you die in that house fire she stripped her clothes off and ran through the fire to get you out he said it made it may not look beautiful to the world but you ought to have love and honor respect for your mother for what she's done for you you know what as paul said he said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation one because he knew what he knew where he come from he knew what he had been through and just and just like that girl you know she become embarrassed by the things that that that her mother was but when you begin to look what she done and the world and the world's not going to desire jesus he's not gonna they're not gonna desire the word the word but you know when you begin to look to see where you i was once lost but now i'm found amen when you begin to see where you come from and you know where you where you are today and what god has done for you then when you when you come back say well i don't care if nobody else likes it it doesn't it doesn't have to please anybody else i know where i come from i know what he's done for me i'm not i'm not i don't have to satisfy the world it's just it's just it's just a fellowship between it's just communion between me and i'm god i'm not worried about what the world says you know gonna start be like brother bob up here but i tell you what it feels good this is from the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief brother man's talking about the the apple trees and he says every apple that's ever been in that trees he said is in it right then certainly is if it doesn't where does it come from it's in the tree he said and you plant the tree in the ground you irrigate it you put water on it what does that little tree do he said it grows and why how it grows it drinks it draws from the water draws from the earth water it draws more than its portion more than enough to fill it it draws just so much until it pushes out limbs and branches and apples then goes down and hides through the wintertime keeps the south from being killed in the tree what intelligence runs it down into the ground and hides it through the winter he said put a water in a 10 cup set on the fence see if it'll go down when the winter time comes certainly it won't some intelligence runs it down that same intelligence that runs the water in there is the same spirit of god that's brought us together for this convention the same spirit that's bringing us together here under the heavenly places in christ jesus to find his goodness and mercy for the hours that lay ahead of us oh he's real god is so he's brought us to this place why because now's the time of the feeling the time of refreshing you know i mean the every church service is a time to come in and get all that you can and fill up he said we find out this little tree it pushes out when it grows it pushes out and when you are born into the kingdom of god just a little baby in christ everything that you have need of need of in this life's journey is in you when you receive the holy ghost oh then what do you have to do is drink and drink and keep on drinking don't just don't just stop when you join church and are baptized just keep drinking until you have faith for this and faith for that and faith for this and push out until all the manifestations of the holy spirit is living in the church he said and he says and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him he said how are we planted we're planted in christ jesus now i believe just in my estimation of him he's the inexhaustible fountain of life that you cannot exhaust his goodness some people think oh i hate to call on god so much that's what he wants you to do you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joys might be full that's what god wants ask big things so when god has called us to this place god's called us to this word then it's now it's our time to get what what we have need of it to drink and he said he's an inexhaustible fountain so then we just continue to drink and take in all that we can as he said he said get more than your portion get more than enough because you know when we see these situations come just like the disciples you know they're looking at the situation well you know what god's in the situation we turn to god and we can find what we have need of that he can give us everything that we have need that we can he said keep drinking until all the manifestations of the holy spirit are made known so how do you grow you keep drinking [Music] then you keep drinking you know you just keep fighting the battle you keep pressing in because the battle he said you the kingdom of god is taken by forces then what you do you just keep on fighting and you keep on pulling you know even even the tree when you talk about that tree it is down in the roots and you know even in the wintertime and i didn't i didn't know this and wait said i can't believe you didn't know that well i didn't know that praise the lord but you know even when the life goes down in the roots you know that life is in there in the summertime now the root you know the life goes up into the tree and it's the leaves and the fruit and all those type things but when it goes down in the winter time and it goes down in into the root system do you know the the roots never quit growing you know what even in the winter time when we said well that tree's dead well it's dormant why because we don't see anything but we don't recognize that there's growth taking place if we could dig down into the ground down in those routes when it gets below the frost line and the ground is still warm and there's moisture down there then you know those roots are still going they're still going and they're still reaching out and many times we look at our lives and we say well it's it's a it's a it's a dead season it's it you know we're just in this in this lull or whatever and it's just like you know everything is so hard and we don't see but you know one time when we look back in our lives when we go through these hard spells these dry spells all these things that happen to us and we wonder why things are going many times when we look back then we we recognize that we've grown through that time we didn't see it looking forward but when we look back you know what we've grown through those times well we don't recognize the growth that takes place you know it's just like your kids when you watch your kids grow up you know we just see them and all of a sudden one day you know we they walk past us you know i mean you know one time they're all the time like this next thing you know they're like this and then all of a sudden they block your vision when they walk past it's like come here why because you when you see them every day and they just keep on growing you don't recognize the growth one day you buy them shoes and you buy shoes and and it's like well you got these shoes and before they wear them out they're already outgrown them and it's like do they put miracle grow in the shoe it's like they put them on and their toe grows to the end of them and it's like you don't see the growth but all of a sudden all of a sudden there's the proof and it's the same way we don't we don't see the growth taking place but you know what many times in our lives we're wondering why why things are the way they are and you know what many times and we're waiting for god and we then god will take us to a place and look back it's like well you know what we have grown amen many times we don't we don't think that we had you know we've overcome things or are different things and you know we've had you know you see different things in your life that's happening and you look back he's like i've overcome that anything well thank god god's helped me through that amen because then we see you we see the growth that's taking place see god god knows what he's going to do sometimes he wants us to see what we're going to do many times he says we walk by faith and not by sight and many times that's the problem we're walking by sight we see we see the things around us and sometimes by looking at the things around us and not looking at the word we don't see what what god has done and where we're at this is from the the patmos vision brother random says oh you say you you don't feel any difference though he said jesus wasn't born when god slayed him before the foundation of the world when he was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world but in god's own mind he was already it was he was already done i wasn't here then neither neither was you but in god's book if our names was ever on there it was put on before the foundation of the world when god says anything it has to take place so when you meet god's qualifications just remember god will manifest himself and take care of the rest of it you just go ahead it is a finished work oh isn't that wonderful i think just tell god and god said you do this and i'll do this well if i do this he's got to do that amen so when god brings us you know when we when we say well we don't see any difference well people coming in the prayer line it's like well you know i don't feel any different well your feelings don't matter he said you know if he calls your name when brother branham was in the discernment line you know he would catch people and say oh sir you didn't believe you didn't know that you had that much faith but god's speaking to you and you're healed or people would come across the platform and he would lay hands on them and there were times that he wouldn't even pray for he would just lay hands on them well because the scripture he said if you lay hands on the sick they'll recover he didn't say you had to pray you just say lay hands on him so when they passed by brother just laid hands on them and he and he you know he would speak to him and he would ask them he said do you believe me to be god's servant do you believe the word that i've spoke tonight do you believe that jesus christ is here do you believe that he'll heal you he'll deliver you that's right amen and you know they begin yes yes yes he said by your own confession he said go and receive your healing so it wasn't it wasn't that that he had to do anything but he had to get to get the people to believe and to see and focus on one thing and he said when they begin to see that then yeah then he has and then there were times when he talked about how full the the building was just full of faith you could just see it throughout the building he said just stand to your feet and claim you accept your healing he said you don't have to have somebody anybody pray for you or do anything he said you just stand up and claim it and so here he is well i don't feel like well that has nothing to do with it if god began to speak to you and say this is what this what i want to give you when he begins to speak just not only is it divine healing but whatever you have need of and when he said add to your faith virtue well you know when god begins to speak to you then you accept what he has to say then you know what it's just the same thing it's the same faith it's the same process that when you begin to accept the word receive the lord he said when you receive the word then you become the word then you begin to walk in the word and it's the same process it's not it's not some some one way of doing one thing and one that way doing something else no it's the same way god works the same way every single time so if god ever had anything that he wanted to give you then you know what you claim it the same way said so he said if you if you meet god's qualifications you just believe and walk right and say lord don't let me have any stumbling blocks in my way lord let me get everything out of the way let me clear the way let me clear the path lord let me clean out the flus let me get everything out of the way lord that i can that you can come speak to me lord that i can come on the same grounds the same qualifications that others have come that i can receive the same thing that i've been that you know god because you you by your word you've come and you told us lord don't come up this statue of a perfect man and to add our faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and come on up the ladder well then lord then the lord deliberately just continue let us grow that we walk up that ladder amen that would be that you become molded in into our in our lives lord that we're molded into your image lord that the world can see jesus christ in us but he said he said you just go ahead he said he said one because he said it's finished he said so he'll take care of the rest of it but there's a part you got to play there's a part you got to do he said i will take the rest i'll take care of the rest but if we will do what god wants us to do do the same thing take god at his word follow follow the pattern if we follow the pattern then you know what god will bring to pass his word amen you know uh brother branham this is from watchmen water the night and brother branham this is the story brother i'm talking about the little boy the little baby that had cancer and they had to wrap the towel around his head and you know the uh the nurse had to clean out the breathing tube and and all that you know brother brandon's heart was broken and he's standing there and and he says he said i thought jesus do you mean you get pleasure out of seeing that he said i can't believe it i just i just can't believe you get glory out of that little baby suffering like that it just can't be if it makes me a sinner feel like i do to that baby what would what would it do to you the resource of all mercy what must you do and i had no no words yet he skipped we skipped down and he says and i looked down to this little fella and i thought lord what would you do if you were standing here now i realize that i'm in the pulpit i really and i realize that god is present but it seemed to me that something spoke down in my soul and he said i'm waiting to see what you're going to do about it i gave my authority to the church and there you come back again to say say to this mountain i gave my authority to the church and i'm waiting to see what you're going to do i wonder if that's his attitude toward us all the time that he's waiting to see what you're we're going to do what about the signs of the time we best we just been preaching about what would he do he's waiting to see what we'll do he said well i got i got this little baby baby hand in mind just in my fingers like that it was so little and i said lord hear the prayer of your servant and by faith that i believe that you are that i believe that you are i place between this demon of cancer in this baby's life the blood of jesus christ between the killer and the baby the blood by faith i placed it and i couldn't say nothing else and you know brother brian walked out of that room and it wasn't long right after that you know they come and told him said you know what he's healed but you know it was there was god speaking to the prophet and saying i wonder what you're going to do about it we always wonder what god gonna do about it well what is it what did you and he said sometimes that's what it looks like god is waiting on us to do something well sometimes you know have we ever asked god what god what do you want me to do what should i do what is my responsibility lord what is it what is it that that's my part to do you know when when abraham went to went to get a bribe for isaac and he sent elazar into the homeland to get a bride you know then he he swore out to eliezer you know he said listen he said you go and do and the lord will lead you he said but if you if you don't find one he said you're free of this oath but you know he said lord he said my father abraham my sir my master has sent me he said lord i'm going down in here he said lead me show me the way that i need to go and when he went down in there he said lord the one that i meet at the well he said let her be the one and then she'll offer to to water the camels amen and when he walked up there and then then rebecca began to speak to him and said well let me draw the water for you and let me water the camels and all that and he began you know began to converse and and all these things and he began to tell rebecca all about isaac and and all the things that took place and you know she received the word and she had to go talk to her father and her mother and her brother and the you know the family and you know they had to go through all that but you know she received that word and she believed it she said i'm going this is this is this is my calling you know and then she took she received the the gifts that isaac had sent by the prophet to her and she received those and all along this dangerous journey back to the back to the land but you know what she followed and she listened to what eliezer had to tell her and she listened and she she began to understand all about isaac but you know what the camel's done brother venom said that was the power of god bringing but that was you know that was only a certain port a part of what was to take place but you know what when she got close enough and she saw isaac in the field you know she didn't just sit on the camels and wait uh you can just drop me off right here when she saw him in the distance she didn't wait for the camels to bring her all the way when she began to see who who was before her because the word had been preached to her so much that she recognized isaac standing in the field well then you know what she put she took the bracelets and the gifts that she was given and she put a veil on her face and she took the gifts that were given to her and you know what and she went and met him in the field one because so you know god done his part and broad alleys are up and the word has been given but you know what it's time because the scripture tells us he said to rejoice he said because the bride has made herself ready so when she prepared herself then she went to meet the meet isaac to meet the bridegroom so the thing is is you know you and i have a responsibility to prepare ourselves for the bridegroom there's a portion there's a part that we must play that we must go do so what are you going to do lord well what are you going to do what is god calling us to do that's what god is asking you know because if if all that god was he poured into christ and he poured into the church he poured into the believers amen then you know what then we are there where were to be nothing less than jesus christ then we're supposed to be nothing less than completely dressed robed in his righteousness prepared then that's what god has for us to do is to prepare ourselves to do what he wants because he's already known what he's going to do the question is is what you and i are going to do what are we doing what are we doing with the time that we have what are we doing with the things that god has given us let's not get things out of cater let's not get things out of place you know jesus there when he when he fed the 5 000 and they collected all of those fragments and they gathered up all of those 12 baskets then the scripture says that those men that had seen that had seen the miracles had seen the food being distributed all those things then they turned around and said surely this is the one that the prophet spoke about that would come but you know what they got they tried to get him out of his place because jesus didn't come to set up a kingdom but that's what the scripture says they were waiting to to come and grab jesus to set up a king because they were going to make him their king and when he when he saw what they were going to do then he left he departed out of their midst and brothers and sisters you know that's the time when brother brahma said you know there are things that we should do and we shouldn't do we shouldn't misconstrue the word we shouldn't get things out of place so the spirit in us that has been given to us is given to us for us to directly divide the word so in the time of of this of this world that we live in all the confusion and all of the chaos and all these things but there is one that is still leading us that is leading us the right way that's going to bring us to the proper place bring us all the way he knows what he's going to do the question is do you know what you're going to do do you know what to do that's the that's the question god bless you tonight let's all stand how the musicians come [Applause] amen amen it's a glorious day that we live in amen we're so blessed amen amen because you're all on the altar see amen amen you have long for sweets and for faith to increase and evernessly [Music] fervently brain but you can have rest or be perfectly blessed until all lonely altar is lame [Music] your heart does a spirit control [Music] you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield in your body and soul would you walk with the lord in the light [Music] you must do his sweet will to be free from all ill only alter your all you must lay is your own the altar of sacrifice length your heart does a spirit control you can only be blessed and happy since we rest as you body and soul oh we never can know what the lord will bestow of the blessings for which we have prayed till our body and soul [Music] is on the altar of sacrifice laid your heart does the spirit control you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you you in your body and soul who can tell all the love he will send from above and now happy our hearts will be made of the fellowship swing we shall share at his [Music] [Music] of sacrifice laid your heart does a spirit control you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield him your body and soul you know i think of the story that brother branham tells about the lady that had he was poor and she said you know welfare had to come check on her find out what her situation was they said you know she had a son that had sent her those little pretty pictures that she said the prettiest pictures but you know she needed she needed somebody to come it was like because you know she was starving to death and she was so needy but somebody come to check on her and said well can we see those pretty pictures and she went got our bible and she opened them up and started pulling out these pretty pictures and you know when they showed them he said what were they he said they were bank drafts [Music] and her son was in india and had converted all that money over and sent her all that stuff but she didn't recognize what she had what was so amazing is you know they asked her said you hear from your son it's like well if your son loved you and you had a need it seemed like he would take care of you and she's like well i'm so embarrassed to ask you oh i don't i don't want to ask you well you know what if she went to her son and contacted him it's like i gotta need some mama all them cards some pretty pictures they're bank drafts that's money but she didn't go and ask him what that was somebody had to come and ask her and to help her because she had somebody had to get to her she didn't ask for help somebody had to come and realize hey they they have a problem she has a need we got to go help her and she had she had everything that she had need of she just didn't realize what she hated and many times we get in our own way but it's the as you're all on the altar tonight because you know it's a it's a sacrifice and like she was she was she felt she felt a little embarrassed but don't let any of those things get in the way you know because one of these days you're going to stand before a god to give an account for those things and standing before your brothers and sisters are walking down the aisle or doing whatever [Music] that's that's that's that pales in comparison whatever it has need whatever it is as brother branham said you know you know if we if we come in here with the wrong spirit the wrong attitude we can hinder the service [Music] something can take place in this building tonight he said they could hinder the next service like i don't i don't want to have to stand up and give an account that i was the one that caused the problem i don't want to be the one to have to stand up and give an account that somebody didn't get their healing because of me but you know what he's he's brought all this to us [Music] so you can i can receive what we have need of he's standing here and he calls out to us every single day god's speaking to us so i i just want to be on the altar by all to be on the altar not to be a hindrance to anybody but to be a help god bless you tonight as we go do you have anything all righty well just remember each one and uh for the way to be preaching sunday and uh i do i do have one one

we're expecting to see miracles but i did want to make i didn't want to make one statement and it and i may be out of line and i'm going to apologize but i didn't want to say one thing pop if you ever feel like you want to get up here but you don't want to preach we would love to have you come up here and do sunday school on sunday morning just come up it don't have to be long just come whatever's
