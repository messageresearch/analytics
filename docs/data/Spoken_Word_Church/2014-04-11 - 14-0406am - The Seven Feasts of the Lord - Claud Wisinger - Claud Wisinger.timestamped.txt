[2:15] find no fault with this church can I
[2:16] tell you that I really can't like you
[2:19] know oh uh pilate had to say that about
[2:21] Jesus is that right he said I can find
[2:23] no fault in this man why do you
[2:25] persecute him I can honestly say no
[2:27] fault with this church wonderful
[2:29] Ministry I'm excited to be here and be
[2:31] able to be a little part of it this
[2:32] morning appreciate brother Samuel and
[2:35] sister Peggy uh my mother's name sister
[2:38] Peggy and sister Peggy's a lot like my
[2:41] mother uh that that name Peggy my mom if
[2:45] you wanna if you want to know what she
[2:46] thinks about you ask her
[2:48] sometimes sister Peggy you don't even
[2:50] have to ask her and some sometimes my
[2:52] mother's that way it really doesn't
[2:53] bother me because actually I'm a lot
[2:56] like my mother so I couldn't understand
[2:58] where sister Peggy's at nothing wrong
[3:00] with that uh uh you know every joint
[3:04] supplyeth in the church is that right
[3:05] we're workers together there's none of
[3:08] us separate if you separate yourself you
[3:10] become a domination you can become a
[3:12] one-man denomination that's the biggest
[3:13] fear I have right and uh we don't want
[3:16] to do that brother random said
[3:17] denomination of course is death he gave
[3:19] it a name in this hour
[3:20] so we appreciate last time I was out
[3:22] here I preached on the book of
[3:24] redemption I was preaching out of
[3:26] Revelation and I know people told me
[3:28] they enjoyed it I thank God you did you
[3:30] know I get to enjoy it before you do God
[3:33] gives me the Revelation then I give it
[3:34] out to the church and what I did when I
[3:37] went home to kind of give you an idea
[3:39] how I got where I'm at in the world
[3:40] Minister day I've been on the same
[3:42] series since I left here and the series
[3:44] has been the seven feasts of the Lord
[3:46] and what I did was when I preached the
[3:49] book of redemption next thing I did when
[3:51] I went home because you know you preach
[3:53] a mystery of redemption there's more to
[3:55] it there's always more to the you it's
[3:59] Eternal do you understand that when you
[4:01] get over the other side these things
[4:03] that you've learned here is going to be
[4:05] a tip of the iceberg
[4:06] God's going to keep unfolding to you
[4:09] over there so that feeling you get here
[4:11] when you come here and you get a
[4:12] revelation you want to run around the
[4:13] building can you imagine what it's going
[4:15] to be like where every day every minute
[4:17] of the day God's going to be unfolding
[4:19] to you it's going to be subliminal do
[4:22] you understand we don't have human words
[4:24] to even express what it's going to be
[4:26] like over there so when I went home I
[4:28] said okay where did what books in the
[4:30] Bible did Brother Branham call or refer
[4:33] to as the book of redemption well I
[4:34] found there were five of them one of
[4:36] them was Book of Revelation well I
[4:39] preached the book of redemption here I
[4:41] already preached Revelation then he
[4:42] preached Ruth I went to Ruth and I I
[4:44] preached a series out of Ruth and then I
[4:47] went to uh Exodus is where I'm at right
[4:49] now and exodus I've been in Exodus now
[4:52] for since last September is where I've
[4:55] been and then what I'm fixing to do I'm
[4:58] gonna go to Joshua because Joshua
[5:00] parallels the fishes and Ephesians is a
[5:03] book of redemption did you know that it
[5:05] shows how that perfect Church they were
[5:07] redeemed and brought back Redemption has
[5:09] two things you got to come out and
[5:11] you've got to go in so Redemption ain't
[5:13] just you come out of the world and the
[5:14] things of the world you've got to go
[5:15] into Christ is that right so we don't
[5:18] want to stop halfway like he said last
[5:20] night in the Bible look if you're happy
[5:23] where you're at today I'm going to worry
[5:25] about your experience
[5:26] exactly I'm going to be honest with you
[5:28] if you get complacent and there's ease
[5:31] in the Church of Zion you're in a
[5:34] terrible spot because you the holy
[5:36] spirit is moving water and like the old
[5:39] son of the move is on the bride is
[5:42] moving we're moving out of here we're
[5:44] going higher higher higher is that right
[5:46] so I'm gonna I'm gonna continue on but I
[5:49] want to call it
[5:50] the seven feasts of the Lord and what I
[5:53] want you to understand is a lot of
[5:54] people this is a mistake what a lot of
[5:56] people in the message make they take a
[5:58] quote brother Brandon uh said and and
[6:00] they don't run it through their Bibles
[6:02] do you understand that brother random
[6:04] says faith final resting places in the
[6:05] word so if I get a quote what I try to
[6:08] do I feel like I'm obligated face final
[6:10] resting places in the word to finish
[6:13] your Revelation and to put you on
[6:15] establish you on a foundation which is
[6:17] Faith I got to take these quotes and
[6:19] find them in the word just to be a quote
[6:21] quota anybody can read the quotes and
[6:24] quote quote but do they know their
[6:26] Bibles do they know the author of that
[6:28] Bible that's the real question in the
[6:30] era we are so what I try to do is I try
[6:32] to go back and show them where these
[6:35] little things brother Brown said was in
[6:36] the word and then the people will be
[6:38] established you can't go out there and
[6:40] preach brother Branham to them you
[6:43] better go out there and bring them your
[6:44] Bible
[6:45] because I've said sums you know where
[6:47] brother Ram said the three wise men were
[6:49] you know him represented the Gentile the
[6:52] Samaritan and the Jew you can't find
[6:54] that in your Bible
[6:56] I said that to assembly God one time
[6:58] woman she said show me in the Bible
[7:00] I never could
[7:02] but you know what I had a prophet it was
[7:03] a Divine interpreter of that word and I
[7:06] took him at face value but I shouldn't
[7:07] have said that out there they got to
[7:09] receive a profit before they get to
[7:11] further apart
[7:12] so you better be careful when you say
[7:14] you're quoting brother Brandon you
[7:15] better have your Bible to back it up
[7:17] that's what I'm telling you they'll
[7:18] embarrass you I got embarrassed and I
[7:21] but it was a lesson learned for me okay
[7:22] not keep you standing we're going to
[7:24] read the scripture they got displayed up
[7:26] there uh Leviticus 23 2 and I want to
[7:30] jump over to Leviticus 23 4 and and
[7:33] again what I was getting ready to say
[7:34] and I kind of stopped the trouble of
[7:36] people are they say with Daniel 70 weeks
[7:38] they say well that's the Daniel and
[7:40] their people like we don't need that
[7:41] part of the Bible
[7:42] when in Revelation 10 it says the bride
[7:45] ate the whole book last time I checked
[7:47] Daniel was a part of it
[7:49] right then people will say okay the
[7:52] trumpets are to Israel they have nothing
[7:55] to do with the Gentiles so you know what
[7:56] most the message preachers do they throw
[7:58] it on a dumpster right just along with
[8:00] Daniel 70 weeks don't they exactly and
[8:03] but you know what it's you go look
[8:04] brother random said in a quote I'll give
[8:06] you the Feast of trumpets runs from
[8:08] Revelation 6 all the way to Revelation
[8:11] 20 19.
[8:13] or as you throw away Feast of the
[8:14] tropics you might as well tear up
[8:15] revelation 6. to 19. right am I am I
[8:19] telling you the truth that's what he
[8:20] said
[8:21] so people you better you better get
[8:24] these things and start figuring out what
[8:25] brother Brown said and it's the ministry
[8:28] that's supposed to get this to the
[8:29] people amen and the failure in this
[8:31] hours of ministry the failure in Jesus
[8:33] hour was describes the fair the ministry
[8:36] the failure Moses Ministry was the 70
[8:39] were ministers they're the ones that
[8:41] troubled him brother Ben said the ones
[8:43] that give me my biggest problem are
[8:44] ministers the ones that give the bride
[8:46] the biggest problems are the quote the
[8:48] ministers
[8:49] that's why you may you'll notice I'm
[8:52] hard on preachers because look they're
[8:54] not coming up to where they need to be
[8:56] let's just face it they're the people
[8:58] are having to message people or have to
[9:00] endure these quote message preachers
[9:02] brother said a church age book they'll
[9:05] endure the ministry the preaching if
[9:07] you're enduring the ministry here hey
[9:10] you ain't right A to B preacher hey you
[9:12] both ain't right you need to we need to
[9:15] get this thing we need to get ourselves
[9:16] positioned okay let's go Leviticus 23 2.
[9:20] speak into the children of Israel and
[9:22] say to them concerning the Feast of the
[9:24] Lord which ye shall Proclaim preach
[9:26] proclaims preach to be holy convocations
[9:29] they're holy Gatherings a convocation is
[9:32] a gathering or an assembly even these
[9:36] are does it say Israel cease
[9:39] what is tell me what it says
[9:41] my feast so people preach on the feast
[9:44] days because they say well that's the
[9:45] Israel the Bible don't say that exactly
[9:47] that's their Revelation what they think
[9:49] it says Revelation 23 4 these are the
[9:53] feasts of the Lord
[9:56] huh
[9:58] even holy convocations holy Gatherings
[10:01] which ye shall Proclaim in their Seasons
[10:04] so there's a season for every one of
[10:07] these Feasts
[10:08] that's what I want to talk about I'm
[10:10] going to kind of tell you what I'm gonna
[10:11] do I'm gonna talk about the first four
[10:12] feasts I'm gonna fly through them
[10:14] don't get discouraged if you don't get
[10:16] it okay because the first four feasts is
[10:18] so thoroughly covered in the Bible in
[10:20] the message I think you ought to know
[10:21] that it's by now the Feast of trumpets
[10:24] I'm gonna land there and I'm gonna stay
[10:25] there for quite a while then I'm gonna
[10:27] try to make it to the Feast of atonement
[10:29] if I can that's as far as I've got in
[10:31] our church these seven feasts I preached
[10:33] 60 Parts on it already but I broke it
[10:35] down to the offerings to the Tabernacle
[10:38] to the every minute detail of them just
[10:40] what your pastor did with predestination
[10:42] remember Ephesians is a book of
[10:44] redemption when you're a pastor you may
[10:47] say he preached 60 Parts on
[10:48] predestination he preached 60 parts of
[10:50] redemption exactly you need to recognize
[10:52] what the wheelchair is hitting from your
[10:54] pastor let's bow our heads your heavenly
[10:57] father we thank you for the reading the
[10:58] word pray that you give the people a
[11:00] revelation brother and said well we need
[11:01] the most the most important thing that
[11:03] this church can receive right here today
[11:05] is a revelation may they get that Lord
[11:08] and you look up the definition of
[11:10] revelation you click on it it means
[11:12] coming how did you know we're looking
[11:14] for a coming
[11:15] a meeting in the air we see descended
[11:18] down on Sunset mountain in 63 but as he
[11:21] come to you the individual he has to
[11:23] come to you and that's what it's all
[11:26] about you have to take that the book
[11:29] from the mighty Angel not for the seven
[11:31] Church age messenger from the mighty
[11:33] Angel that's the experience in this hour
[11:35] that's the seventh seal that's when it's
[11:39] finished and you drive a state down be
[11:41] with us in this service we ask these
[11:43] things in Jesus Christ's name amen sorry
[11:45] to keep you standing let's go to the I
[11:48] guess page two I have like 42 pages so
[11:51] you know I got to fly through it I can't
[11:53] you know I can't get it all but I want
[11:55] to show you some things where it kind of
[11:57] got me going and just briefly touch on
[11:59] again the verse 4 piece but I'm really
[12:01] really want to get to you the trumpets I
[12:03] think I think the troubles trumpets are
[12:05] probably just as misunderstood as
[12:07] Daniel's 70 weeks and it's because
[12:09] Brethren said whether to Israel it's the
[12:12] same attitude but what does Daniel say
[12:13] it's unto Daniel his people so we just
[12:16] we see Feast of Tabernacles or the seven
[12:19] trumpets and we just blow right by him
[12:21] oh that's the Israel but if you don't
[12:23] understand it you're not going to
[12:25] understand the Book of Revelations
[12:27] simply put I don't know how else to say
[12:30] it right you're not and what does the
[12:32] scripture say blessed is the man that
[12:34] readeth and understandeth the says of
[12:38] this book
[12:40] this book The Book of Revelations
[12:42] this is the book that actually is the
[12:46] coming of the Lord again I want to say
[12:48] it because I think it's an important
[12:49] point you can say the Jesus came in 1963
[12:53] that cloud wonderful I'm glad you see
[12:56] that right but have you seen that coming
[12:58] to you amen that's what you were getting
[13:01] at last night in Roman Paul spoke from a
[13:03] personal revelation he put his name on
[13:06] that Revelation does everybody
[13:07] understand that
[13:09] have to have a personal
[13:12] Revenue I got told the church I said you
[13:14] ever notice it and on the world they say
[13:16] you know somebody if they don't have
[13:18] flesh in it it don't concern them I got
[13:20] news for you we all got flesh in this
[13:22] one this is these Soda Man and what is
[13:25] the these subtle man is when the words
[13:27] made flesh right when you see receive a
[13:29] revelation to write Revelation it's the
[13:31] word becoming flesh
[13:33] so the Revelation isn't coming to you
[13:36] it's him coming right inside his flesh
[13:38] in the form of a revelation
[13:41] pretty easy isn't it we ought to we
[13:45] ought to be able to explain these things
[13:46] to people hurt people running around
[13:47] like these creatures like turkey with
[13:49] their head cut off they don't know what
[13:50] they're doing right and I say I'm hard
[13:53] on I'm sorry but it just it irritates me
[13:55] we've been in a message 50 years and
[13:57] we're still singing preaching God sent a
[13:59] prophet God said a prophet God said what
[14:02] did he say right I get it I understand
[14:05] God sent a prophet that ain't going to
[14:07] get you in a Rapture the Rapture book
[14:10] this is what I tell my church the people
[14:13] in the message have made a atrocious
[14:15] mistake because Brethren have said in a
[14:17] Rapture book The Rapture is a revelation
[14:20] does everybody agree that's what he said
[14:22] so what they do they think there's a
[14:24] silver bullet out there so one of them
[14:26] says the Thunders that's it so it's
[14:28] their interpretation of Thunder's at
[14:30] seven men
[14:32] seven Thunders and you've got to fall
[14:34] under their Ministry false
[14:37] and they think this is this is the
[14:39] Revelation or a revelation is you're
[14:40] gonna make a Rapture with and there's
[14:42] another group of guys that's perusia
[14:43] another group of guys that's the the two
[14:46] Lords but what they do and some it's the
[14:48] son of man right I'm gonna be honest
[14:50] with you they fall in love with one
[14:52] Revelation they say this is the
[14:54] Revelation is going to make a Rapture go
[14:56] read the Rapture book Brethren talks
[14:57] about all the revelations
[15:00] does everybody understand that it's it's
[15:02] it's the it's you've got to take all the
[15:05] revelations and put them together and
[15:07] the Revelation is Jesus Christ
[15:09] so it's a revelation the revelation of
[15:12] Jesus Christ who is the word so what
[15:15] they're doing they're looking for a
[15:16] silver bullet or you're sitting around
[15:18] maybe in this church looking for one
[15:20] Revelation that's going to take you out
[15:21] it's going to take every word to
[15:24] proceedeth thou the mouth of God
[15:26] this hour is the fullness of the word
[15:29] Luther's message will not get you to a
[15:32] rapture
[15:33] it won't we have received in this hour
[15:36] the fullness of the word and if the
[15:39] message preacher is not preaching the
[15:41] fullness of the word leaving because he
[15:44] can't get you to a rapture
[15:47] and you need a pastor right amen amen
[15:49] you need a man a Shepherd that's going
[15:51] to feed you the word
[15:53] that's the only way he is a true
[15:55] Shepherd
[15:58] this is a quote when I went home I was
[15:59] looking up you know I what I did I
[16:02] looked up Booker and I said okay I want
[16:04] to preach out to Exodus I put the word
[16:05] Exodus and read every quote that's why I
[16:07] do it when I get a subject people think
[16:09] I'm crazy if I get 987 quotes I read
[16:12] them all
[16:13] I must be crazy I sometimes I think I'm
[16:15] kind of loose you know but I want to
[16:17] know what it says all the way from 40
[16:19] and 8 all the way to 65.
[16:22] some of the things he said in 54 he
[16:24] changed some of me didn't right
[16:26] your brother Robert had something wrong
[16:28] he'd corrected it right amen I preach at
[16:32] home I preached a sermon that morning
[16:33] and went home still studying the subject
[16:35] and realized I left the wrong impression
[16:38] and I come back at night and I'll you
[16:40] know what I'm not so big I can't say I'm
[16:42] wrong right
[16:43] man there's preachers in this message
[16:46] there's one in particular I'll tell you
[16:48] a girl that goes to our church he was
[16:50] preaching two Lords
[16:53] and she was going there and he said you
[16:57] showed me in the message where brother
[16:58] man says it can't be two Lords
[17:00] she was reading one day in a book she
[17:02] found her brother and said he's not two
[17:03] Lords she went in and knocked on his
[17:05] door to his office took the message book
[17:07] up and said you told us if we can find a
[17:09] quote bring it to you she brought him
[17:11] the quote
[17:12] he got up on his nuts
[17:14] get out of my office
[17:19] are you kidding me
[17:21] this is a guy that'll say to let us
[17:22] reason together
[17:24] yeah if he's wrong and you can prove it
[17:27] by the Bible I believe this man will
[17:28] correct amen exactly
[17:30] if I'm wrong you show it to me the
[17:32] message in the Bible oh correct amen
[17:34] right do I believe I know everything no
[17:37] I don't but let's see if you think you
[17:39] know everything you know with nothing he
[17:41] said if you got it all figured out
[17:42] you're wrong
[17:43] start over right you don't ever get that
[17:46] attitude and you're I'm always learning
[17:48] I can read the seals this year and read
[17:50] them next year and God gives me a
[17:51] further Revelation
[17:52] and we were talking in the back some
[17:54] preachers you know that's what scares me
[17:56] you use it right
[17:57] but there's some preachers that
[17:58] investigate well it's Progressive what
[18:00] they're really saying is they progress
[18:01] Beyond brother Branham
[18:03] and the message they got you can't find
[18:05] under their messenger that's what
[18:07] they're saying I don't use the word
[18:09] Progressive I looked it up there's not
[18:10] one quote that says Progressive in the
[18:12] entire bio an entire message but there's
[18:15] one word I believe it's a stimulation of
[18:17] Revelation and wine gets stronger with
[18:20] age this Revelation gets stronger every
[18:23] time I pick up the seal so I I'm not
[18:26] condemning him because he says it
[18:28] because he explains what he's saying but
[18:30] you get some of these preachers that say
[18:31] that they're going beyond the prophet
[18:33] right and the bride is the final voice
[18:35] to the final age under her messenger
[18:38] under it
[18:40] God finished the mysteries in William
[18:42] Branham I tell our church if somebody
[18:45] comes this Pulpit preaches a mystery you
[18:47] run from them right because we're
[18:49] preaching a revelation not a mystery
[18:51] right right does everybody got what I'm
[18:53] saying the mysteries of God are finished
[18:55] I'm not looking for Brethren I'm back to
[18:57] come back to preach me anything he
[18:59] doesn't preached it I got to get a
[19:01] revelation of what he said
[19:03] so the most important thing the emphasis
[19:06] in this hour is revelation above all
[19:09] right and that's what I want to
[19:11] emphasize and if you get your Revelation
[19:13] right you'll exalt Jesus Christ amen you
[19:15] won't exalt him exactly you won't exalt
[19:18] the church you won't exalt yourself
[19:19] you'll exalt Jesus Christ
[19:23] that's what that sister accused brother
[19:25] random she said brother random you talk
[19:27] about Jesus too much
[19:28] okay yeah I don't know
[19:31] if you get the atonement
[19:33] you're gonna you're gonna put Jesus way
[19:34] up here and everything else is going to
[19:37] be below that
[19:38] the most important thing in my life is
[19:41] Jesus Christ
[19:43] what it is first quote let's read it he
[19:46] says here we're talking we're taking
[19:48] Israel now in their Journey coming out
[19:50] of Egypt type of the world on their way
[19:53] to Palestine
[19:54] the Promised Land
[19:56] I think it's a beautiful thing I just
[19:58] love it pretty listen to this this is
[20:00] your Prophet said this
[20:02] pretty near every week right
[20:05] I sit down and read through the book of
[20:07] Exodus right is that a shocker
[20:09] every week I read through the book of
[20:12] Exodus
[20:14] or as much of it as I can right
[20:17] I love it because it's a perfect time
[20:19] for the church today
[20:21] the condition how God was moving he
[20:23] moved in what he did in the natural then
[20:25] he's doing in the spiritual now see it
[20:28] and I got to thinking on this quote I
[20:30] said why why did Brother Branham want to
[20:33] read what drove him to What Spirit did
[20:35] he have that pushed him to Exodus and I
[20:37] realized brother Ram is an exodus
[20:39] Prophet right
[20:40] Moses was an exodus prophet
[20:43] Moses said there's going to come a
[20:45] prophet like an unto means
[20:47] right what was Jesus an exodus Prophet
[20:50] every time you see an exodus Prophet an
[20:53] exodus you see three things a prophet a
[20:56] pillar of fire and a cloud exactly did
[20:58] you see that with Moses right did you
[21:00] see it with Jesus Christ remember he
[21:02] went up in cloud of witnesses the
[21:04] descended only River the light in the
[21:07] form of a dove all those things show all
[21:09] those things showed up with William
[21:10] Branham exactly so without a fault by
[21:13] the scripture I can prove to you William
[21:15] Branham was an exodus preacher right
[21:17] prophet and he was taking us out of
[21:20] denominationalism
[21:21] are exactly some of you may have never
[21:23] been in denomination you're in the world
[21:25] the world is the result of
[21:27] denominationalism
[21:28] go to Walmart these women are stripped
[21:30] off the preachers have done it right
[21:34] you want me to say it again
[21:36] go back into Exodus they were once the
[21:39] preachers set up the golden calf right
[21:41] and those people were dancing naked
[21:43] around it who put them who got them
[21:45] naked the preachers did exactly
[21:48] exactly who gets the people to lay on
[21:49] the seat of their blind wretched
[21:51] miserable naked and they think they're
[21:53] in need of nothing who has done that to
[21:55] them preachers right
[21:58] preachers are preaching them into
[21:59] nakedness before God where they have
[22:02] where they have no covering exactly do
[22:04] you agree with that man exactly
[22:07] it's the truth it's a preacher's fault
[22:09] you see this stuff going on if there's
[22:11] something going on in the church if this
[22:13] man don't jump on that spirit and get it
[22:14] now he's not jumping on the individual
[22:16] he's jumping on the spirit that's in the
[22:17] individual if he don't stop it on the
[22:19] day of judgment he's going to be
[22:20] responsible for that exactly he's the
[22:22] head
[22:23] does everybody understand that right the
[22:25] man you're the head of the family when
[22:27] things come to your into your house that
[22:29] the message says you shouldn't have it
[22:31] there you'll stand in judgment for that
[22:34] like I told the sister some of our
[22:36] sisters they're divorced from their
[22:38] husband you're the head of the house now
[22:39] Sister you'll stand responsible for that
[22:41] you better step it up if you women here
[22:44] don't have a husband you got kids you
[22:46] better step it up and apply the token
[22:48] right right you have to apply the token
[22:50] that's one of the rules of accidents the
[22:53] token has to be applied
[22:55] man does everybody agree with that
[22:57] okay
[22:59] okay
[23:01] okay let's go down
[23:04] so and I put a moon here I wanted to
[23:06] talk to you about the the seven feasts
[23:09] of Israel do you know it's about it's
[23:10] based on the moon right
[23:12] do you know who the moon's a type of
[23:14] Church
[23:15] what did Brother random say was holding
[23:16] up the Bride of the rapture
[23:19] the Moon
[23:20] she's not where she should be scripture
[23:23] says the moon will be the strength of
[23:26] the sun of seven days
[23:28] at the end do you agree with that so the
[23:31] seven Church ages we have all that they
[23:33] had plus right so we're the light of the
[23:36] seven age plus amen so you know what she
[23:40] is what brother Ram said if you're the
[23:42] light of the son of seven days if I say
[23:43] she is him do you get bugged out I had a
[23:46] message preacher one time I said she is
[23:47] him she said brother animal he said it
[23:49] once I said the scripture says it all
[23:50] over I just read you one right it said
[23:52] but my sister said one liking unto the
[23:55] son of man right who was it brother said
[23:57] that's the bride amen one like the son
[24:01] of man I mean everything looked just
[24:03] like him but he was what was it bride
[24:06] form is over his paps right not gird
[24:09] around his here is a servant like he was
[24:11] when he watched disciples feet
[24:12] so does everybody understand it's it's
[24:15] brought the bride it's Jesus in Bride
[24:17] form amen and that's his coming in this
[24:20] hour
[24:21] okay how's he come to the bride by
[24:23] Revelation it's so simple okay
[24:26] first one is Passover that's the first
[24:29] piece I'm just going to read these real
[24:30] quick Feast of unleavened bread Feast of
[24:33] first fruits counting of the Omer and
[24:35] the Feast of Pentecost the Feast of
[24:38] Pentecost is really the 50th day right
[24:41] so the the Feast of Pentecost includes
[24:43] all the way you start counting from the
[24:46] first the Feast of first fruits to the
[24:47] Pentecost is 50 days
[24:49] but everything in between that we call
[24:51] it the Feast of Pentecost right exactly
[24:53] well it's not 50 here it's 50 here
[24:56] does everybody understand what I'm
[24:57] saying but we call it the Feast of Pitta
[24:59] it's inclusive of all that and we can do
[25:02] that and I'll prove it to you by the
[25:03] scripture why we can do that so you have
[25:05] what they call the county of the Omer
[25:06] you have the Feast of Weeks do you
[25:08] understand if you got 50 50 days right
[25:11] well there's seven days in a week so
[25:14] there's seven sabbaths right seven times
[25:17] seven is 49. exactly the 50th one is
[25:20] fifty right 50 is plenty that's where
[25:22] Pentecost comes from right does
[25:24] everybody agree with that man
[25:26] that's where the day of Pentecost it was
[25:28] 50. right is that right when the Holy
[25:30] Ghost fail everybody agree with that
[25:31] right amen okay
[25:35] then you got the Feast of trumpets okay
[25:37] then you have the day it's one day of
[25:40] atonement right what did Brother Adam
[25:42] say Israel be saved in a what
[25:44] where do you think he's pointing back to
[25:47] man which one of them feasts only say a
[25:48] day
[25:50] exactly he said under the Feast of
[25:52] trumpets what did the Jews Miss right
[25:54] yeah you know what the Feast of trumpets
[25:56] does it calls them back to their day of
[25:57] atonement
[26:00] it's true
[26:03] because when I prove to you and we know
[26:04] we believe it but where are you gonna
[26:06] put in the word right you just go throw
[26:08] it out there and it's a philosophy to
[26:10] you yeah if it's not in the word it's a
[26:12] philosophy exactly you know what if it's
[26:13] not in the word your philosophy your
[26:15] ideas as good as my philosophy and idea
[26:18] that's what we got we got a bunch of
[26:20] preachers preaching well I think we went
[26:22] to a meeting last time with Daniel 70
[26:24] weeks
[26:25] they'd been given the charter brother
[26:27] Branham they're gonna it's the last
[26:29] meeting we're going to talk about Daniel
[26:31] 70 weeks and the guy gets up on the
[26:33] Whiteboard says this is what I think
[26:34] brother M said then he used the
[26:37] scripture in first Chronicles which is
[26:39] the wrong scripture to use for it not
[26:41] only did he draw the wrong chart he put
[26:43] the wrong scripture with it right and
[26:45] brothers said don't misplace mislocate
[26:47] misquote right I was sitting here and
[26:49] brother Wade was there that's all I
[26:50] could do was sit there wasn't it I sit
[26:52] there going man I was about ready to pop
[26:53] a cork I thought are you kidding me
[26:56] 40 50 years of messy that's as far as
[26:58] you've gone right you don't trust
[27:00] brother Bradham any better than that
[27:02] right well he said seven times if you
[27:03] want to understand Daniel say we go back
[27:05] to Mike
[27:06] sure
[27:08] now they won't even you know
[27:11] you can see the chart out there you'll
[27:14] see it on your website
[27:16] I'd use it when I preach why can't they
[27:18] use the church age chart they use the
[27:21] statue of a perfect man chart
[27:23] we get to use it
[27:24] because they got I thought yeah my idea
[27:28] my philosophy of what he's saying
[27:31] it don't matter what you say it's what
[27:33] the messenger said amen the only way
[27:35] you're gonna stay under this message is
[27:36] to be under your profit exactly
[27:38] it's the highest order is a prophet
[27:41] exactly you cannot get over brother
[27:42] Brandon your revelation will not
[27:44] progress further than is dead
[27:47] that's why I don't like the word
[27:48] Progressive it leaves an open-ended
[27:51] statement but if I say
[27:53] stimulation of Revelation Brethren said
[27:55] that I can read lots of quotes with that
[27:56] right
[27:57] maybe you say I'm picky I am picky I
[28:00] think we ought to say only what set on
[28:02] tape
[28:05] they'll use it on you right oh yeah
[28:07] you're saying only what's set on tape
[28:10] well they'll take a quote over here and
[28:11] argue a quote over here I'm going to
[28:13] show you an instance of me and brother
[28:14] we kind of stood off on two quotes
[28:16] didn't we
[28:18] but you got to have a revelation of what
[28:19] it's talking about or you'll never get
[28:20] it together exactly because brother Adam
[28:22] used that same scripture two different
[28:24] ways
[28:25] did he not right I'm gonna read it to
[28:27] you later because I you know if I'd have
[28:29] said it's morning I wouldn't read both
[28:31] of them
[28:32] they probably read the last one for an
[28:34] interview and you only get what I'm
[28:35] saying you're saying that ain't what
[28:37] Brother Sam was talking about you okay
[28:39] dude you gotta listen to you gotta stay
[28:41] with me today because I'm gonna move
[28:42] okay
[28:43] exactly okay we'll warn you amen
[28:45] like I know the last one is the Feast of
[28:48] Tabernacles brother Brandon said in uh
[28:51] future home no if it's the tavern I
[28:54] don't worry said it I don't have the
[28:55] quote here he said Feast the Tabernacle
[28:57] he said we're now feasting under the
[28:58] Feast of Tabernacle you know why I said
[29:00] that because we're in the seventh Church
[29:02] age
[29:03] where that type starts and finishes when
[29:06] fisa is seven right right yeah does
[29:08] everybody understand it brother babe
[29:09] said we we're in the Feast of
[29:11] Tabernacles in the Millennium exactly
[29:13] there's where your true seven day starts
[29:15] but brother may have typed it as the
[29:17] Millennium which is the seventh day
[29:19] right everybody okay any type that as a
[29:21] seven Church age as long as you use the
[29:23] seven you're okay brother Brandon was a
[29:26] prophet he knew where to start his types
[29:27] and finish them
[29:28] exactly so if you use a type you better
[29:30] start it and finish it where he did or
[29:32] you go too far you'll go beyond where
[29:34] brother Brandon did okay
[29:39] I know everybody again I can see your
[29:41] faces do you realize that your face
[29:43] tells me if you're getting it yeah and
[29:45] right now I'm not worried because it's
[29:47] I'm going to all bring it back together
[29:48] I'm throwing information out on you now
[29:50] and I'm going to gather it back up here
[29:51] in a while okay well I tell my church
[29:53] don't get frustrated if you can't follow
[29:55] me at first just just get in there what
[29:57] I'm saying get it between your ears and
[30:00] we'll get her hopefully God will Quicken
[30:02] it by the time we get to the end of it
[30:03] okay okay and her brother Banner spoke
[30:07] of an eighth one yeah
[30:08] now there's some preachers that have an
[30:10] eight day Doctrine oh yeah yeah you got
[30:12] to see that and you that's the
[30:13] Revelation you got to have because
[30:15] that's going back to the beginning
[30:16] that's going back to Eden if you don't
[30:18] believe this you're lost no I'm not
[30:20] going to believe it all
[30:22] I believe in seven Thunders don't you
[30:24] right way
[30:26] I believe in proves you all proves you
[30:28] is God With Us that's sanctification
[30:30] folks sanctification ain't gonna take
[30:31] you in a Rapture so these big dummy
[30:34] message preachers are preachers if you
[30:36] don't get it you ain't take it around
[30:37] you mean you're gonna take a Rapture of
[30:38] sanctification
[30:39] Isn't that with you farooja means god
[30:41] with you his presence I got more in his
[30:44] presence
[30:47] it's wet I'm a I'm light years Beyond
[30:51] Perugia
[30:52] two Lords
[30:55] are you kidding me yeah
[30:58] do you see what I'm saying they got they
[31:00] got this Silver Bullet a revelation that
[31:02] you're gonna make the right if you don't
[31:03] believe it like they do you're gone
[31:05] but under the Rapture Brothers don't
[31:07] talk about one Revelation does he he
[31:09] covered you ought to go see it it's like
[31:11] when I read the book I said okay there's
[31:13] a revelation I gotta get in here and you
[31:15] read it
[31:16] he's talking about everything
[31:18] so what he's talking about it's the
[31:20] revelation of Jesus Christ and under
[31:22] that
[31:23] is Thunders Church ages Daniel in 70
[31:26] weeks predestination It's all under
[31:29] there and all that makes one thing the
[31:31] revelation of Jesus that's your
[31:33] revelation
[31:34] you know why do we make this hard so the
[31:37] Eighth Day in Jews in jewry there is no
[31:39] Aid
[31:41] it's seven plus one yeah had brother
[31:44] random said hey he said brother Adam
[31:46] you've run out of sevens remember in
[31:47] future home he said oh no I didn't what
[31:51] does he read he goes back and reads the
[31:53] holy the holy communication part of
[31:54] these Feast people
[31:56] it's back to the beginning
[31:58] so seven plus one eight is seven plus
[32:01] one right so eight is back to the
[32:03] beginning AC turn you ever seen how we
[32:05] write eight
[32:06] no we're into it people exactly yeah
[32:08] right see eight right you see any end of
[32:11] that no there's nothing open in it you
[32:13] know it's eternity
[32:15] right so that that's future home that's
[32:17] about I don't know how much simpler you
[32:18] can make it than that but what's brother
[32:20] Brandon preaching out of
[32:22] he's preaching the feast he reads it
[32:24] every week you think he don't know these
[32:26] things he starts breaking it down for us
[32:27] he's taking the shadow of the Old
[32:29] Testament and bringing it to life giving
[32:31] a revelation for us of what these are I
[32:34] know every one of those feasts and I'm
[32:36] walking right through it Jesus for three
[32:38] and a half years he went to the Passover
[32:40] he went to the day of unleavened Earth
[32:43] Feast of unless Jesus naturally walked
[32:45] through every one of those Feasts
[32:47] remember he said on chapter St John 7 he
[32:50] said this
[32:52] he said are you going to go to the great
[32:53] great feast
[32:54] and Jesus said well you're going down
[32:56] didn't he say that
[32:58] and then it says in chapter 7 it says he
[33:00] said he secretly went down to the great
[33:02] feast now that was the Feast of
[33:04] Tabernacles that's the seven you know
[33:06] when he come the seven Church age it was
[33:09] a secret coming he shows the coming in
[33:11] Revelation chapter 7 under the Feast of
[33:14] Tabernacles in the seventh Church age do
[33:17] you get what I'm saying brother random
[33:19] is taking these shadows and types of the
[33:21] Old Testament and breaking it down to us
[33:23] and giving us the revelation of what
[33:25] they really are
[33:26] so we need to go back these are the
[33:28] feasts of the Lord these aren't Israel's
[33:29] Feasts
[33:30] Israel thinks it's theirs
[33:33] no it's the Feast of the Lord I got as
[33:35] much right to it as Israel does exactly
[33:37] I got just as much right to the Book of
[33:40] Daniel as Daniel's people do
[33:43] he said seal it up till the end time
[33:46] it was we've received this we know
[33:49] Daniel's 70 weeks the seal in the
[33:52] prophecy of it was broke to us God's
[33:54] going to redeem Israel the same way he
[33:56] redeems you the Daniel 70 weeks is no
[33:59] different than what he's doing in the
[34:00] seven Church ages if God redeems you
[34:03] differently does Israel he figured a
[34:05] better way to do it then he ate God he's
[34:07] a man like me and tomorrow I'll fight
[34:09] you don't have to do something I said
[34:10] man I shouldn't have done it that way
[34:11] that's the God don't do it that way when
[34:14] God does something he does it right the
[34:15] first time okay let's go up let's read
[34:17] Deuteronomy 16. I want to show you
[34:19] something
[34:20] just go up a little bit where I get that
[34:22] scripture okay right there whoa
[34:23] Deuteronomy 16 16 three times a year
[34:26] shall all thy medals appear before the
[34:28] Lord thy God in a place which she shall
[34:30] choose in the Feast of unleavened bread
[34:34] okay and in the Feast of Weeks and in
[34:37] the Feast of Tabernacles and they shall
[34:39] not appear before the Lord empty right
[34:42] right you know what you had to do though
[34:43] you had to bring a tithing
[34:45] and offering a tithing right you
[34:48] couldn't come empty the Lord right does
[34:50] everybody understand that exactly you
[34:52] ain't gonna come empty before the Lord
[34:55] right right exactly amen like I tell
[34:57] them if you go look at Future home
[34:59] brother Brandon said this he said that
[35:02] those kings of the nations are going to
[35:03] bring the tithing of the earth out
[35:04] they're going to be a tenth part of all
[35:07] the potatoes the fruit that's out there
[35:09] and they're going to bring it into the
[35:10] city right in exchange for that tithing
[35:13] they're going to get leaves off the tree
[35:14] right guess who's in that city right
[35:17] the bride guess who's going to be the
[35:19] ones that pay tithes here given it will
[35:21] be given hey people if you don't pay
[35:23] tithes here you ain't gonna be in the
[35:25] news you ain't gonna be in that pyramid
[35:26] City
[35:27] go ahead be a hard head go ahead there's
[35:30] no tithing of the New Testament the word
[35:32] tithing means this part
[35:35] 10 that's what you're supposed to give a
[35:37] 10. actually 100 of us Gods he allows
[35:40] you to keep 90. you you Meathead you
[35:43] look at it the wrong way you say oh I
[35:46] Gotta Give no you only give 10. God gave
[35:48] the other night God gave the whole thing

[36:16] great time
[36:19] that's what we're going to
[36:21] okay let's go up a little more let's go
[36:26] we're going to talk about the Passover
[36:27] passover's the first feast and let me
[36:30] tell you I didn't tell the moon does
[36:32] everybody understand the moon goes
[36:33] through Cycles I said it yesterday I
[36:35] want to kind of throw it out there you
[36:36] go you know there's a dark side of the
[36:38] moon there's a dark moon and there's a
[36:39] full moon every month do you know you're
[36:42] the church and you go through your ups
[36:43] and downs every month right
[36:45] the moment's a type of you this is what
[36:48] we do oh brother so-and-so's down we're
[36:51] going to kick him while he's down he's
[36:53] going through maybe a quarter moon or of
[36:55] you know he's all blacked out and you
[36:56] say oh that brother he's in a crowd of
[36:58] her preachers call other people that
[37:00] they're antichrists or they may be just
[37:02] going through a cycle right you can't
[37:04] look at a man and say they're no good
[37:07] right you gotta accept them the way they
[37:09] are even after the New Birth you're
[37:11] gonna go through Cycles in your life
[37:12] right I just went through the middle age
[37:14] crazies I don't like it right I didn't
[37:17] buy a red Corvette but I did buy a red
[37:19] boat
[37:23] I'll be honest with you I want to be
[37:25] young again that's what it's like for a
[37:27] man all right if you if you enjoy being
[37:30] old there's something wrong with you
[37:31] right
[37:32] but I enjoyed being 30 years old I had a
[37:35] blast
[37:36] and you know what the reason I'm excited
[37:38] about this I know I'm going back to that
[37:41] Glory this ain't the final state of me
[37:43] this is just a season I'm going through
[37:48] all right okay so the moon all these
[37:51] feasts started on a uh by the moon the
[37:55] way they start abib the priest goes out
[37:58] into barley field and when he sees the
[38:00] Barley have green ears on it
[38:02] the first full moon after those first
[38:05] green ears appear that's going to be the
[38:07] Passover did you know that
[38:10] look the the religious calendar is set
[38:13] by the moon right right the ready is the
[38:16] bride do you see the Rapture set by you
[38:18] that's why God wouldn't give a day or an
[38:21] hour right because it's where you get
[38:23] positionally placed you all come to a
[38:26] fruition you all have green hairs it's
[38:30] gonna be over
[38:33] you're God you ain't waiting on him he's
[38:35] waiting on you to get right
[38:39] yeah so the priests to go out there and
[38:40] see the green ears he'd take the first
[38:42] fruits he'd take a he'd take a bundle of
[38:44] that he'd take it to the temple and take
[38:46] a rod and beat it
[38:48] he'd Beat It Off the shuck right and
[38:51] he'd have a bowl there with an Omer and
[38:53] omer's three and a half pints yeah and
[38:56] you take that three and a half bites and
[38:58] wave it before the Lord
[38:59] if the Lord accepted it
[39:02] then he'll accept the rest of the crop
[39:04] exactly this is what a lot of people
[39:06] don't understand about first it says
[39:08] Feast of first fruits plural right we
[39:11] always talk about when they waved it on
[39:12] that day you know they took their crop
[39:15] Omer of it every day and waved it over
[39:17] it
[39:18] and you say why is that important every
[39:20] Church age
[39:21] on that day the best of the crop out of
[39:24] Paul's day got waved over the rest of
[39:27] them right exactly
[39:28] they were pulled up well you mean Paul
[39:31] was in a rapturing state and his people
[39:35] he was let me let me give you a hint
[39:38] this is what brother Ram said the token
[39:40] don't come till the evening time do we
[39:41] all believe that exactly see what you
[39:43] always think is she's talking about this
[39:45] day he is let me explain it to you the
[39:49] messenger comes at what
[39:52] Paul was applied the token to that
[39:54] church age which was the life of the
[39:56] word in that hour
[39:58] if it was part word that was the life of
[40:00] that hour
[40:01] Paul looked through a glass Darkly he
[40:03] didn't have the fullness of the word
[40:04] right
[40:06] but Paul was the that message was the
[40:08] token message of that hour
[40:12] and those people under Pauls were the
[40:14] ones that come to fruition and God waves
[40:16] them over the Earth right
[40:18] right just everybody get what I'm saying
[40:20] but remember it's an Homer it's three
[40:22] and a half
[40:24] how long was Jesus ministry when he's
[40:25] here the first time
[40:27] three and a half years what's he what
[40:29] did Paul wave over his people right
[40:31] three and a half year Jesus ministry
[40:33] amen
[40:34] what did all the church say what did
[40:36] Brethren wave over the people three and
[40:38] a half years exactly
[40:40] exactly did he
[40:42] but we know seals were broke that Mighty
[40:45] Angel come there was another three and a
[40:47] half years of ministry
[40:51] there's your Messiah week
[40:52] So when you say that one like it under
[40:54] the son of man walked through the church
[40:56] age that Paul was that
[40:58] walked up and down
[41:01] Paul was Bride for him right
[41:04] right do you agree with that
[41:06] if Paul did not have the token in his
[41:08] hour how's he going to take a Rapture
[41:09] his breath
[41:11] you ever think of that all right all
[41:13] right it's not just the token in this
[41:15] hour right
[41:16] it has to be the life in that hour right
[41:18] how did brother man pick all the seven
[41:20] Church age Messengers they had signs
[41:22] Miracles they were 100 their life was
[41:25] according to the word right
[41:27] they had the token life
[41:29] so the token was applied in the evening
[41:30] time but every one of the messages right
[41:33] right does everybody agree with that
[41:35] so it's the Feast of first fruits it
[41:37] goes not only the day that Jesus rose
[41:39] but there's people that rose out of
[41:41] every Church age pulse groups in the
[41:43] sixth Dimension they come up off the
[41:45] Earth
[41:46] did you be honest with you they've
[41:47] already been raptured right
[41:49] you want the truth I've already been
[41:52] ratcheted scripture says I'm we're
[41:54] sitting together in Heavenly places Paul
[41:57] said we're only waiting for the
[41:58] Redemption of the body I'm already in a
[42:01] raptured state I'm already caught up
[42:03] after the church's AIDS come up hither
[42:05] we're past the church ages I can prove
[42:07] it to you we're fixing it look we're
[42:10] fixing to well the seven that was what
[42:12] Feast of Pentecost did it with the feast
[42:13] what's what after we leave here Where's
[42:15] God going Feast the trumpets
[42:18] his shows were in Pentecost is everybody
[42:20] got what I'm saying right right so
[42:22] literally God's calendar for the time
[42:24] Jesus died all the way to the holy
[42:26] convocation is feast days the calendar
[42:30] your personal experience you got to walk
[42:32] all the way through it you've got to go
[42:34] all the way to the Eighth Day the holy
[42:35] convocation
[42:37] right if you don't walk and experience
[42:39] every one of those days you're gonna
[42:40] come up short somewhere
[42:42] does everybody understand what I'm
[42:43] saying you have that's yours you have to
[42:46] personally walk through it right
[42:51] right through it whatever their portion
[42:52] was they had to walk through it
[42:54] and as God as long as they kept true
[42:56] that everywhere to proceed out of mouth
[42:58] of God in that hour
[43:00] then it was accounted to them they're
[43:01] going to be in the Rapture right but if
[43:03] they don't have a token if they don't
[43:05] have a lamb how are they going to come
[43:06] up
[43:07] on the day of atonement there were seven
[43:10] Lambs given you know what that types
[43:11] there was a lamb in each age right
[43:13] right right they had to have the lamb
[43:16] exactly what is it I tell the church
[43:18] when you say Lamb of God say flesh of
[43:20] God would you do that instead
[43:22] when it says Lamb of God it's flesh
[43:24] right
[43:25] it says Jesus was the Lamb of God he was
[43:27] the Flesh of God
[43:29] does everybody under that was he was not
[43:32] the same type of man you are right he
[43:34] was not born of a woman he was born of a
[43:36] man right right that's why you're you're
[43:39] you're you're born of a woman and your
[43:41] days are full of trouble
[43:43] exactly I'm going to tell you guys
[43:44] something every one of you here if
[43:46] you're born of this church you're full
[43:48] of trouble right if you're born of the
[43:50] son of man you weren't full of trouble
[43:53] the ones that's going to give him the
[43:55] biggest fit is you that go to this
[43:56] church have a church birth but you don't
[43:59] have a birth of the son of man until you
[44:02] get to the birth of the son of man
[44:04] you're gonna be full of trouble right
[44:07] everybody got what I'm saying
[44:09] you're the one to give this man the fits
[44:12] right
[44:13] yeah
[44:14] okay
[44:16] so they had to have a token and look
[44:18] they left on a full moon to pass over
[44:20] you know God was so gracious now they
[44:23] had to go out at midnight did you know
[44:24] that remember he said be ready keep your
[44:28] clothes go in haste
[44:31] he said midnight right let's go boys two
[44:34] million people go walk out and it's it's
[44:35] the darkness of the Moon yeah they'd be
[44:37] falling into houses they'd be tripping
[44:39] over it'd fall into a hole right God
[44:42] says you know what I'm gonna get I'm
[44:43] gonna give them I'm gonna bring that
[44:45] Exodus people to a Full Moon where at
[44:47] least they see where they're going right
[44:49] that's why I said you at the end time
[44:51] you'll be the strength of the Sun in
[44:52] seven days how you gonna trip up
[44:56] if you got the strength of a son in
[44:57] seven days man you can't get any
[44:59] brighter than that yeah we ain't not yet
[45:01] on Earth exactly but the bride
[45:03] spiritually speaking is walking in that
[45:05] light right in this hour amen there's
[45:07] nothing can trip you up that's why I
[45:10] don't worry about calling the preacher
[45:11] into Pullman if he preaches false doctor
[45:12] he'll trick me or my church I said I
[45:15] believe I got confidence in what I
[45:16] preach the word if they preach false
[45:18] Doctrine my people will sit there and
[45:20] never receive it because I've
[45:22] established them in the word picture
[45:25] ideas preacher and it won't go over my
[45:27] church
[45:28] because the people have been taught and
[45:30] you've been taught and you teach the
[45:31] people I told you guys yesterday I mean
[45:34] it I understood it here that's why I
[45:35] said it you guys are the Most Blessed
[45:37] people on the face of the Earth the
[45:39] world says you're the off scaring of the
[45:40] Earth

[45:43] when you cook food it's that stuff
[45:44] around the edge that you don't put on my
[45:46] plate and you thought in the trash
[45:47] that's what they think you are off
[45:49] scouring but we're the cream of the crop
[45:52] in this hour our natural lives may be a
[45:56] joke to most people I tell our church I
[45:59] don't know this is pretty rough I don't
[46:01] care if you've been married 18 times
[46:02] that don't bother me a bit

[46:06] Justified you never did it right but you
[46:09] better get to the birth of the son of
[46:11] man or you're still gonna have that on
[46:13] you

[46:16] I'm not worried about their flesh right
[46:19] I don't know a man after his flesh
[46:21] exactly I know you after the spirit if
[46:23] you've got the spirit of the Living God
[46:25] I know you I don't know your flesh and
[46:27] furthermore I don't I don't even want to
[46:28] allow my flesh I hate it
[46:30] I was born of a woman I have an insulin
[46:33] pump I come here every time I go here I
[46:35] gotta be on antibiotics and my I got
[46:37] allergies about I can only see right now
[46:40] but you know what I'm moving this guy
[46:43] that I got will never Slow Me Down
[46:46] I may go through a phase when I'm down
[46:48] but I have some on the inside of me that
[46:50] never gives up that never comes to
[46:53] unbelief and he keeps driving me home
[46:58] right token read up a little bit where
[47:00] they'll go see Uncle quote
[47:02] right there
[47:03] it's talking about oh little people my
[47:05] brother sister get under that token
[47:07] quickly see don't don't take no
[47:09] substitute don't don't do that don't
[47:12] just imagine it right
[47:14] the most dangerous states you can have
[47:16] is think you've got the only just
[47:17] imagine you got the Holy Ghost you're
[47:20] sitting under sanctification that's the
[47:21] worst place you can be at in this hour
[47:23] sanctification your little bus
[47:25] tribulation wide open right it's this
[47:27] it's the tribulation say it Sanctified
[47:29] ones that go through that sanctification
[47:32] ain't gonna get you in a rapper proves
[47:33] you ain't gonna get you in a Rapture
[47:35] right you could come in the presence of
[47:37] this Shekinah Glory in the present until
[47:40] you get it in you right right you're
[47:42] just coming into his presence right
[47:44] exactly not good enough it's okay with
[47:47] Luther is okay with Wesley it's not okay
[47:50] in this hour am I doing away with
[47:52] justification no but we have a further
[47:55] part of it
[47:56] all right
[47:58] open
[48:00] you stay there until you know that that
[48:02] token well you know what no is faith
[48:05] I know if I touch His Garment I'll be
[48:07] healed was she you know what it was when
[48:09] she said I know it's faith
[48:12] right right I know if I do this I'll be
[48:14] healed I know if I do that I'll be
[48:15] healed right but then said your faith
[48:17] healed me what did they do they had a
[48:19] thought in their mind if they did this
[48:20] they'll get healed they did right
[48:22] because why they had a revelation that's
[48:24] what that's what that's what Paul did
[48:26] his life was all built around Revelation
[48:28] right William Brown's life all about
[48:30] Revelation irenius all of them a
[48:32] revelation
[48:33] that's what brought the signs that's
[48:35] what brought the Miracles right right
[48:37] they these they'll follow them that
[48:39] believe
[48:40] amen you're getting out of order you
[48:41] want the gifts and half of you ain't got
[48:44] to where you need to be yet right
[48:46] you know what I don't want the gifts
[48:48] before I before I get the Revelation
[48:49] exactly right because if I do I can
[48:51] misuse the gifts if you get the
[48:54] Revelation you'll use the gift right
[48:56] right amen the Pentecost got the gift
[48:59] but they didn't get the giver and they
[49:01] had so now they claim that's the
[49:02] evidence
[49:03] so it's a gift to the Holy Spirit right
[49:06] right man people well I'm glad I'm so
[49:09] happy for this message
[49:10] thank you people think we're
[49:13] know-it-alls

[52:05] on Earth I supposed to feel something
[52:07] right God was giving him a revelation he
[52:10] showed him the sixth Dimension he shows
[52:13] what it's going to be like over there
[52:15] over there sister Peggy I'm gonna give
[52:17] you a big hug and kiss all right I know
[52:18] that doesn't look too good here
[52:20] but over there I can do that because we

[52:24] Sensations over there
[52:25] think I'm funning with you I'm not
[52:27] there's some sisters over there I'm
[52:29] going to give a big hug and kiss too but
[52:31] I won't dare do it here
[52:32] because of this
[52:35] nonsense guy I got do you understand
[52:36] what I'm saying
[52:38] okay
[52:39] see that then you know then you know
[52:42] something is happening Jesus said these
[52:44] signs shall follow them and believe
[52:45] after this
[52:48] he didn't put this up here he put this
[52:51] down here
[52:52] not make Believers but Believers see now
[52:55] we don't want to take any chance on it
[52:57] you must do it right brother bear I'm
[52:59] showing you how to prove you got the
[53:00] holy ghost or not
[53:02] exactly he's getting a message he'll
[53:04] tell you if you got it or not if you
[53:06] ain't got it there's nothing brother God
[53:08] wants to give it to you more than you
[53:09] want it
[53:10] amen it's like putting the old ocean in
[53:12] two inch pipe and put it on seeing the
[53:13] pressure that's down at the end of it
[53:14] that's what God wants right you know why
[53:16] people don't have the Holy Ghost they
[53:17] don't want it
[53:20] all right if you don't got the Holy
[53:21] Ghost here of the night you don't want
[53:22] it you know what you're doing you're out
[53:24] there fun and gunning in the world
[53:27] you're all through with the we're on the
[53:29] things of the world your mind's on other
[53:31] things in Christ
[53:32] your central desire is not him
[53:35] you know what most of it is you know
[53:37] what most of your central desires are
[53:38] you right
[53:40] right brother I said the real gift is
[53:42] get you out of the way
[53:48] that's what I thought I I
[53:51] I the eye's been taken out of it for me
[53:54] right it's I exalt Jesus Christ to him
[53:58] only Glory that's where my my exaltation
[54:01] is does everybody understand that
[54:03] okay
[54:05] so this is what he did under the
[54:06] Passover in Exodus when he was coming
[54:08] out when they're coming out of Egypt
[54:09] first thing he had to do was to reveal
[54:12] his name to him
[54:13] so every Exodus he reveals a name to him
[54:16] exactly remember in Matthew 1 17 said
[54:18] Jesus will be born Jesus Capital
[54:19] j-e-s-u-f he's starting in Exodus right
[54:22] there because he's revealing a name to
[54:24] him Jesus right right show me that
[54:27] anywhere else right I will in a minute
[54:29] because it's in the Old Testament you
[54:30] just don't get it
[54:32] but he's in the beginning he says Joshua
[54:34] or Jehovah you know Jehovah's a
[54:36] latinized version of that name the real
[54:38] name is Yahweh all right
[54:40] and Yahweh ain't real because we had the
[54:42] vows to it so we can say it right if you
[54:44] say what that is you can't even say it
[54:49] see the people Jehovah Witness say well
[54:50] you got to be Jehovah Witness you get
[54:51] Jehovah Jehovah you know what I tell
[54:53] them God's name ain't even Jehovah
[54:55] that's a name they come up with they
[54:57] added the vows right that's Jehovah is
[55:00] not the real name
[55:01] that's the latinized grammarized version
[55:05] does anybody got what I'm saying right
[55:07] we'll prove it to you in a minute
[55:09] okay here we go I told Brother Wade he
[55:10] probably preached it did you
[55:12] you didn't
[55:13] that guy's a big man I thought I can't
[55:15] tell him nothing before I come out here
[55:17] you can't tell a preacher nothing you
[55:20] know brother Brandon said he couldn't
[55:20] keep a secret yeah thank God
[55:24] the days The Voice the seventh angel and
[55:26] he shall begin to sound
[55:28] the mystery got him he couldn't keep a
[55:30] secret right right God made him that way
[55:32] naturally and spiritually
[55:34] your preacher can't keep it quiet
[55:36] we do some things in private but this
[55:39] message I'll cry from the House Top
[55:42] God gives me a revelation I can't wait
[55:44] to get a Pulpit it's like a fire in my
[55:46] bones
[55:47] it'll drive you crazy until you get
[55:48] ready you think you're going to blow up
[55:51] okay and I appeared unto Abraham and to
[55:53] Isaac and Jacob by the name of God
[55:55] Almighty right this is the first this is
[55:57] the second place Jehovah's mentioned the
[55:59] first place Joe with me it's like
[56:00] Jehovah Nissi or Jehovah Jireh he was
[56:04] only known in part the name Jehovah has
[56:06] seven compound Redemptive names under it
[56:08] so what he introduced himself to Israel
[56:11] is in the fullness of Jehovah right in
[56:14] the hour of The Exodus the fullness of
[56:16] Jehovah came into effect
[56:18] I'm the
[56:20] uh I'm the Lord I got to heal up all thy
[56:23] diseases he says he's your banner he's
[56:26] Shalom he's peace God had seven
[56:30] Jehovah was revealing himself as Jehovah
[56:33] the fullness of that name he revealed to
[56:35] Israel
[56:37] now he hadn't before that in Abraham's
[56:40] day it was just Jehovah Jireh the Lord
[56:42] himself certified he showed a portion of
[56:44] it does everybody see what I'm saying in
[56:46] Luther's day he only showed a portion of
[56:47] Jesus
[56:48] that's kind of odd isn't it exactly you
[56:50] agree with that president said they had
[56:52] a dip of the Holy Ghost exactly we have
[56:55] the fullness we got the person here I
[56:57] don't have a dip of the Holy Ghost I
[56:59] have the person of the Holy Ghost
[57:01] everybody understand this is an hour of
[57:03] fullness and that hour at the time of
[57:05] the Rapture at the time of the exit it
[57:07] was a fullness came forth amen it was
[57:09] the fullness in the name of Jehovah or
[57:10] Yahweh let's put it that way in our
[57:13] Bibles you know ours came from Latin
[57:15] then down to King James
[57:16] well the Hebrew one is Yahweh right now
[57:20] y-a-h-w-h but Take the A and the E out
[57:24] and that's what it now can anybody
[57:25] pronounce that can you pronounce any
[57:27] word without a vowel in it no
[57:31] no you gotta have vows right
[57:33] gotta have her you can't pronounce it
[57:35] right they couldn't even say the name
[57:38] but look what the scripture says but my
[57:40] name Jehovah was not known to them right
[57:44] is that right exactly okay look here
[57:47] I'll click on Jehovah it says
[57:50] unpronounced except with the vowel
[57:52] pointings what they're telling you is
[57:54] they had to have the vowels to it right
[57:55] they had to have g j e they added an e
[57:58] the O's and the A's right
[58:00] because without it it's just a four
[58:03] letters does everybody understand that
[58:05] in the four letters you want to use the
[58:08] Latin grammatized way it's Jehovah j h v
[58:12] h can you say that
[58:14] can you say j h v h
[58:17] can you say jhbh
[58:19] you can't they have no vowel in them how
[58:22] can you pronounce a word without vowels
[58:24] I'll challenge you too can't do it
[58:27] but he said that's his name right
[58:29] so they added about this is this is this
[58:32] is latinized right it's where you say it
[58:34] you just read it and say
[58:37] you couldn't say it they couldn't either
[58:40] but he said this is his name right
[58:42] huh let's go down
[58:45] right here 26 3 that quote come up now
[58:48] that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is
[58:50] God anybody question that now
[58:53] brother babe said the Jehovah the old
[58:55] reading the latinized memorized version
[58:56] the Jehovah the old is Jesus the new
[58:59] does everybody agree with that
[59:01] now remember this is the Passover this
[59:04] is where they first come out right God
[59:06] was starting to reveal it when they
[59:07] first come out God has to reveal his
[59:10] name to you
[59:11] in its fullness before you can take a
[59:13] Rapture right exactly
[59:15] I will be honest with you Jesus was the
[59:18] fullest of the godhead bodily so what I
[59:20] noticed was in the days of Moses Jehovah
[59:23] the fullness of that name was revealed
[59:25] to Israel and they took an exodus right
[59:27] everybody agree right in Jesus Day Jesus
[59:31] the fullness of that name was revealed
[59:34] to him
[59:34] and they took an exodus
[59:36] in this hour in the hour William Branham
[59:39] did he preach Third Exodus where'd he
[59:41] get it Exodus right he read There once a
[59:45] week most of what he got out of that
[59:46] book because Brethren knew he was
[59:48] another Moses
[59:49] brother Brandon when he read the New
[59:50] Testament knew he was another Jesus
[59:52] right I got news for you you're another
[59:54] Jesus and Bride for him
[59:56] if you don't think you're another little
[59:58] Messiah
[59:59] if you don't think you're a little Jesus
[1:00:01] you ain't taking an exodus if you don't
[1:00:04] receive the fullness of that you ain't
[1:00:06] going out of here
[1:00:07] the rest of us are going and you're
[1:00:09] gonna look up David I thought they're
[1:00:10] gonna be a rapture
[1:00:12] is that what he said
[1:00:14] that's what he said I'm telling you what
[1:00:15] he said
[1:00:16] the Jehovah the Old Testament is a Jesus
[1:00:19] in there go forward let's do John 1990.
[1:00:21] John 19 19. and pilate wrote a title
[1:00:25] that says here
[1:00:26] and put it on the cross and the writing
[1:00:28] was
[1:00:29] this is not a title
[1:00:31] is that a title the title is Doctor
[1:00:34] lawyer right
[1:00:38] and the writing was Jesus of Nazareth
[1:00:40] the king of the Jews remember the Jews
[1:00:43] read it said he's not our king take it
[1:00:44] down and pilate said I've said what I
[1:00:47] said right
[1:00:48] I said what I said and I'm not taking it
[1:00:51] down
[1:00:51] you know between me and you God had
[1:00:53] moved on him had him put it on there
[1:00:56] pilate you mean this unbeliever oh yeah
[1:00:58] he got anointing of the Holy Ghost you
[1:01:00] could come to this church and get the
[1:01:02] anointing of what he's saying and then
[1:01:03] but if you don't take the anointing back
[1:01:04] out here with you if it's not made flesh
[1:01:06] it done you no good it never was Quicken
[1:01:09] that's the trouble of the message we got
[1:01:11] a lot of guys taking the message out
[1:01:12] between their ears but they never got it
[1:01:14] Quicken it never become a part of them
[1:01:16] that's why 40 years from now they'll
[1:01:18] fall away because her intellectual
[1:01:20] conception can't go as high as a
[1:01:21] revelation brother man said that
[1:01:23] you said they we got that site where it
[1:01:25] says this guy's been in a message 40
[1:01:27] years dropped out this preacher's
[1:01:29] message 40 years dropped out I don't
[1:01:30] care what they were if they don't have a
[1:01:32] revelation if it's your preacher your
[1:01:33] piano player I don't care you don't have
[1:01:35] a revelation you ain't gonna make it out
[1:01:37] of here you're going to fall off
[1:01:38] somewhere exactly right you get on the
[1:01:41] word you get a revelation the word
[1:01:42] you're established you can't fall off
[1:01:43] that right exactly Heaven and Earth will
[1:01:46] pass away but that will pass away
[1:01:48] your quote quote is going to pass away
[1:01:50] one day if it ain't been made flesh in
[1:01:52] you right amen you're just
[1:01:55] teethly symbol is what Paul said
[1:01:58] this title then read many of the Jews
[1:02:00] for the place where Jesus crucified was
[1:02:01] not of the city and it was written in
[1:02:03] this right here was written in Hebrew
[1:02:05] Greek and Latin not exactly you mean
[1:02:08] that long that sign would have been
[1:02:10] it would have been signs of you know
[1:02:12] probably like this on top of where he's
[1:02:14] at
[1:02:15] it wasn't that way let me show you go on
[1:02:18] go up
[1:02:20] okay right here the 4K tonight Hebrew
[1:02:23] letters
[1:02:24] well Yahweh are correctly translated in
[1:02:27] Roman Latin numbers as
[1:02:30] yhwh does everybody see that an
[1:02:33] erroneously translated as jhvh yeah
[1:02:36] that's the latinized version
[1:02:37] the Hebrew version is Yahweh there's
[1:02:40] some religion saying well you got to
[1:02:41] know the name Yahweh don't they say that
[1:02:43] you got some you got to be Jehovah's
[1:02:45] Witness but they they don't realize that
[1:02:48] Jehovah the old is Jesus knew the Yahweh
[1:02:50] of the oldest the Jesus of the new
[1:02:52] so I don't care if you know him as
[1:02:54] Yahweh I don't care if you know him as
[1:02:55] Jehovah that ain't the fullness of the
[1:02:56] name now all right
[1:02:58] you gotta have the fullest word I don't
[1:02:59] care if you believe perusian too Lord it
[1:03:01] ain't gonna do you enough good if you
[1:03:02] don't believe it all right you gotta
[1:03:04] have every word right
[1:03:06] exactly when yahshua you don't say Jesus
[1:03:09] the Hebrews say yahshua yeah
[1:03:11] yeah when yahshua died on the cross
[1:03:12] pilate had the words Jesus of Nazareth
[1:03:14] King of the Jews I just read it
[1:03:16] right I believe in Hebrew that would
[1:03:19] read Joshua on Nazareth blemling
[1:03:22] yahshua is Jesus Greek huh Nazareth is
[1:03:27] of Nazareth vinlik is the king yehudum
[1:03:30] is yehudu jodah the tribe from which
[1:03:32] yahshua descended
[1:03:34] by taking the first letters of each of
[1:03:36] these four words we get
[1:03:38] y-h-v-h you understand or yhvh the
[1:03:42] tetragamation of this is Yahweh right do
[1:03:47] you know what was over the cross was the
[1:03:49] tetragamation of the name Jesus
[1:03:52] of Nazareth King of the Jews
[1:03:55] did you know that's what was over his
[1:03:57] cross
[1:03:58] now let me ask you do you think it ain't
[1:04:00] right scripture says all Heaven and
[1:04:01] Earth is named after the name of Jesus
[1:04:06] right now I'm going to tell you
[1:04:08] something I'm going to show you
[1:04:08] something here you'll get it as part of
[1:04:10] the Passover you've got to get here in
[1:04:12] the Passover the customer Jew was they
[1:04:14] take a lamb they take him out in the
[1:04:16] yard on April the 10th they'd put him on
[1:04:18] display for four days you know what they
[1:04:20] would do if you and brother Wade you
[1:04:23] know they'd have they'd have a house he

[1:05:02] good-looking lamb Mary he had to bring
[1:05:03] the perfect lamb he couldn't be in the

[1:05:07] bringing lamb Sarah didn't have an eye
[1:05:10] eyes were cross-eyed didn't have any ear
[1:05:13] one leg missing and the priesthood was
[1:05:16] supposed to take a perfect lamb right
[1:05:17] they were supposed to look at they they
[1:05:19] had to accept the sacrifice it had to be
[1:05:22] perfect because it typed Christ
[1:05:24] but what the priesthood started doing
[1:05:25] they they started taking less than what
[1:05:27] they ought to what's happening to the
[1:05:29] priesthood in this hour they're taking
[1:05:30] less you've got to present your life a
[1:05:32] living sacrifice I I'm gonna be on we'll
[1:05:35] just can I itemize some things I'm not

[1:07:23] right so he got sloppy but they put the
[1:07:25] name on there well God hung a lamb up on
[1:07:28] the calvary he put his name on it
[1:07:29] Jehovah the old became Jesus see that
[1:07:31] and that's the family name brother
[1:07:34] Brandon preached how many messages of
[1:07:35] identification identified he's preaching
[1:07:37] the Passover you had to be identified
[1:07:40] with your land all right you had to put
[1:07:42] your name on that lamb and what I found
[1:07:45] out the lamb had my name on it I found
[1:07:48] out one day I wasn't the son of Peggy
[1:07:50] and Ed weissinger I was the son of God
[1:07:53] right I was a little Jesus so on the
[1:07:56] cross he had my name there right when he
[1:07:59] was on the cross I was on his mind when
[1:08:02] he was on the cross I was there in his
[1:08:04] loins exactly
[1:08:07] and he put it despite it before
[1:08:10] everybody Jesus king of the Jews and I'm
[1:08:13] a part of that name right that's why I
[1:08:15] don't go to Trinity doctor and I go to
[1:08:17] that lovely name of Jesus Christ King of
[1:08:20] Claude all right
[1:08:22] does everybody understand that right so
[1:08:24] every fullness he reveals the name of
[1:08:27] what he's working under in that hour
[1:08:29] right right in Jesus day it was Jesus
[1:08:32] brother who says Redeemer name right now
[1:08:34] he's more than a redeemer
[1:08:36] who right is he
[1:08:39] he's more than a redeemer
[1:08:41] Acts 2 38 would say this same God has
[1:08:43] made him Lord in Christ right you know
[1:08:45] what we know we imagine this Earth the
[1:08:47] Lord Jesus Christ right right he's over
[1:08:49] you he's in you right right he's with
[1:08:52] you amen it's going to be that way over
[1:08:54] there amen right he ain't gonna change
[1:08:57] he's still going to be the same so the
[1:09:00] Passover is showing where you got to
[1:09:01] start your walk
[1:09:03] you have to identify with that lamb
[1:09:05] right his name is Jesus it ain't gonna
[1:09:07] do you enough good to identify with
[1:09:08] Trinity Doctrine right
[1:09:10] it ain't the Old Testament
[1:09:13] show me
[1:09:15] it ain't there
[1:09:17] right
[1:09:18] so you got to be identified with the
[1:09:20] Lord Jesus Christ and we had a prophet
[1:09:23] brought the fullness of that name
[1:09:25] is that right and we're identified with
[1:09:27] that's your Passover Glory you've got to
[1:09:30] walk walk his possession people is it
[1:09:33] right you've got to walk through these
[1:09:35] feast days you got to possess the
[1:09:36] Passover you've got to possess your
[1:09:38] unleavened bread you got to pass the
[1:09:40] first fruits you got to possess Feast
[1:09:42] prayer because you got to go to the
[1:09:44] Feast of trumpets you got to go does
[1:09:46] everybody understand that
[1:09:48] now your Trump is the seven Church age
[1:09:50] Messengers were they trumpets people say
[1:09:52] well the trumpets don't matter you mean
[1:09:54] the church age Messengers don't matter
[1:09:55] to you
[1:09:56] that's your Feast of trump it's the
[1:09:58] seven Messengers
[1:10:00] so you walk through it do you understand
[1:10:01] what I'm saying
[1:10:04] it's the truth if you don't walk through
[1:10:06] them you you're you're cheating yourself
[1:10:09] the Jews had two killers this was their
[1:10:11] religious killer where they started in
[1:10:13] abib according to the Moon
[1:10:15] they had a civil calendar which was your
[1:10:17] natural birthday
[1:10:18] you had a contract they put that on the
[1:10:21] Civil calendar if we had a marriage
[1:10:23] license they'd put that on it
[1:10:25] but the religious counter started a
[1:10:27] whole different curve it it started a
[1:10:29] religious event
[1:10:31] at your new birth you come from a
[1:10:32] natural calendar
[1:10:34] where you were I was born on 5 16 of 55
[1:10:37] I found out I wasn't born then I never
[1:10:39] even had a beginning
[1:10:41] all right I'm Eternal I didn't have them
[1:10:43] again I didn't begin on Sunday if you're
[1:10:46] if you began on a certain day you're
[1:10:47] gonna have an end all right
[1:10:49] Satan was prepared right he had a
[1:10:51] beginning he has an end devil was
[1:10:53] prepared for the devil so it's prepared
[1:10:55] it had a beginning
[1:10:56] I was in the mind I was the thought of
[1:10:58] God before I ever come to the Earth
[1:11:00] God seen me there perfect amen and only
[1:11:03] there he seen my sacrifice right I had a
[1:11:06] sacrifice there amen right
[1:11:08] come on that's what he said all right
[1:11:09] Glory
[1:11:11] so see you gotta reckon that Passover is
[1:11:15] recognizing who you are and who he is
[1:11:16] hey you're walking right there
[1:11:18] everybody got what I'm saying so
[1:11:20] everybody here you got to be in the
[1:11:22] Passover that's your beginning right now
[1:11:24] the next one go next
[1:11:26] let's go to the Feast of unleavened
[1:11:28] bread I'm taking way too much time
[1:11:30] Lord I am
[1:11:33] no I'm not
[1:11:34] peace
[1:11:36] the rule of it you couldn't eat a lemon
[1:11:38] bread for seven days you couldn't eat
[1:11:40] lemon bread lemon's got leavening in it
[1:11:42] lemonade makes the bread rise it
[1:11:44] actually starts the decaying process
[1:11:47] and I'm going to tell you you girls that
[1:11:48] do bread you throw leavening in it and
[1:11:51] it gets it gets big in a hurry don't it
[1:11:52] see sin Works quick in you once you
[1:11:55] start letting sin get a hold of your
[1:11:57] life it'll go quick you'll turn around
[1:11:59] one day and say how did I get here
[1:12:01] you get sin in your life it'll go just
[1:12:03] like that right
[1:12:05] so a little Heaven Jesus said 11 at the
[1:12:07] whole lump he said the doctor and the
[1:12:09] scribes and the Pharisees that was left
[1:12:10] me right so Jesus showed us there's
[1:12:12] seven days and there was from the second
[1:12:14] day Jesus crucified on Passover right
[1:12:16] the next day
[1:12:18] that's the Feast of it for seven days
[1:12:21] through seven Church ages we have to be
[1:12:24] under that Feast we can't have any
[1:12:26] leavening if we have leavening in your
[1:12:29] message it's decaying it's it's bringing
[1:12:32] death right is that right
[1:12:34] and G brother Brandon now let me show
[1:12:36] you everybody heard God's chosen place
[1:12:38] of worship you know where Brethren got
[1:12:40] that scripture
[1:12:41] unleavened bread
[1:12:43] and we always say well God is where his
[1:12:46] name is
[1:12:47] that's a true statement you only got
[1:12:48] half of it
[1:12:49] he only puts his name where the
[1:12:51] unleavened bread is right
[1:12:54] he don't put his name on a Baptist
[1:12:55] Church
[1:12:57] because they got leavening there
[1:13:00] I'm going to really shock you if you're
[1:13:02] a preacher this message and you've got
[1:13:03] 11 in your message God ain't gonna put
[1:13:05] his name
[1:13:07] God ain't going to associate with leaven
[1:13:11] everybody got what I'm saying for seven
[1:13:13] days seven churches are gonna be no 11
[1:13:15] found in your house
[1:13:16] what they would do the Feast of
[1:13:18] unleavening they didn't have Candlelight
[1:13:20] or light they take a candle
[1:13:22] that go through the house every corner
[1:13:24] if they found a breadcrumb that was
[1:13:26] living bread they would sweep it out and
[1:13:28] burn it right remember brother Ram said
[1:13:30] don't bring that over into this burn it
[1:13:32] he's talking about leavening
[1:13:34] if you bring that Pentecostal message
[1:13:36] over into this you brought leavening and
[1:13:39] what message you have is going to spoil
[1:13:42] so there's preachers in the message that
[1:13:44] got nothing but a Baptist attitude once
[1:13:47] saved always say I believe that in the
[1:13:48] right thing if you place predestination
[1:13:50] right I believe it but some of these
[1:13:52] guys got one saved always saved and
[1:13:54] they've got sloppy Grace mixed in that's
[1:13:56] Lebanon buddy that's that's going to
[1:13:58] Decay that thing
[1:14:00] so you can't bring any leveling into
[1:14:02] this so God's going to put his name
[1:14:03] where there ain't no leavening that's
[1:14:06] his chosen place to worship does
[1:14:07] everybody got what I'm saying so if if
[1:14:10] Lula church has any leavening in their
[1:14:12] Doctrine God ain't gonna put his name
[1:14:13] there exactly God ain't gonna come and
[1:14:15] worship here right
[1:14:17] right because those that worship Him
[1:14:20] must worship Him in spirit
[1:14:23] and Truth amen
[1:14:26] it ain't 99.99 right
[1:14:29] right man it ain't pure
[1:14:32] it's got to be a hundred percent true
[1:14:34] all right
[1:14:36] that's why God put his name here because
[1:14:39] truth is here and God will not associate
[1:14:42] with anything less than the truth I
[1:14:45] don't care you don't scare me when you
[1:14:46] say you're message believer if you got
[1:14:48] unleavened in your life God ain't there
[1:14:50] God is not going to come to your
[1:14:52] Tabernacle
[1:14:53] exactly that's not his chosen place he
[1:14:55] will not live in an unclean Temple
[1:14:57] that's your Feast of leavening let's go
[1:14:59] to the next Feast that's easy isn't it
[1:15:02] and those will get done that quick did
[1:15:03] you
[1:15:05] okay Feast of first fruits that's the
[1:15:09] third day after his crucifixion Jesus
[1:15:10] rose from the dead you know Jesus was
[1:15:13] waved over the rest of the crop Jesus
[1:15:15] came to fruition there was no sin in his
[1:15:18] life he's showing you that you can come
[1:15:19] to that right
[1:15:21] yep
[1:15:22] if he rose you raise with him but look
[1:15:26] you got to be in that body by one Spirit
[1:15:28] you can't do it claude's Spirit can't do
[1:15:31] it brother Samuel Dale's Spirit can't do
[1:15:34] it exactly you're subject to failure
[1:15:36] your body is subject to failure
[1:15:38] exactly so if I want to get lifted up
[1:15:41] off the Earth just like Jesus did then I
[1:15:44] have to not have any leavening in me
[1:15:46] right
[1:15:48] right I got to come to fruition
[1:15:51] everybody okay with that
[1:15:52] and what they did every day or the
[1:15:54] county of the Omer they counted from the
[1:15:56] first Feast of first fruits to the day
[1:15:58] of Pentecost if they were on the 21st
[1:16:00] day this is what the Jews did they said
[1:16:03] we are at the 20 and first day of the
[1:16:06] county of the Omer
[1:16:08] and the rule of the county of Omri is if
[1:16:11] you didn't recognize the day you were on
[1:16:13] you would miss the day the blessing of
[1:16:14] that day
[1:16:15] yeah is that does that does that bring a
[1:16:18] title to you that brother Brandon
[1:16:19] preached recognizing your day in this
[1:16:21] message amen Paul knew the day he was in
[1:16:24] he recognized the messenger and he was
[1:16:26] blessed for that day right the ones that
[1:16:29] are iridius they might have not known
[1:16:31] who the messenger was president said I
[1:16:33] doubt they knew the message was since
[1:16:34] Paul but they knew the message right and
[1:16:37] the message and the messenger are won
[1:16:39] all right
[1:16:40] can I tell you this this message and you
[1:16:43] were one amen this message ain't
[1:16:45] different you this message is you may
[1:16:47] play the message is made flesh in you
[1:16:49] exactly that's the son of man
[1:16:52] does everybody understand what I'm
[1:16:53] saying it's got to come to you you have
[1:16:56] to walk up and down in these feasts
[1:16:57] right it has to you've got to walk and
[1:17:00] possess these feasts or you're not going
[1:17:01] to be there
[1:17:02] is everybody okay this is what he took
[1:17:04] him through to take him to the promised
[1:17:06] land he's going to take you through
[1:17:07] these feasts to get you out of here
[1:17:09] does God change his mind about his word
[1:17:11] brother baby said he ran a weekly in
[1:17:13] Exodus he's put Brother Brad is focusing
[1:17:16] you and putting you on Exodus
[1:17:18] right right I love it do you like Exodus
[1:17:20] whether Brad preached a year on Exodus
[1:17:22] did you know that a year
[1:17:25] he seen he's seen it okay
[1:17:28] and the first fruits remember I told you
[1:17:30] on the day of first fruits they would I
[1:17:33] got out of order a while ago
[1:17:35] but they take an Omer a barley barley
[1:17:37] there's 50 days there's five bread crops
[1:17:40] that come to fruition first one's barley
[1:17:43] did you know that then then the week
[1:17:45] comes after that exactly because that's
[1:17:47] why it says abib it's green ears The
[1:17:49] Barley had green ears on it the
[1:17:51] difference in barley and wheat is barley
[1:17:52] has no lemon in it
[1:17:55] wheat does right if you take a flower
[1:17:58] and you put it in a bowl with water and
[1:18:00] you let it sit there in 17 minutes it'll
[1:18:02] start Rising why it's got 11 in it all
[1:18:05] right you're a type of wheat you got 11.
[1:18:08] this body is 11. you will not perfect
[1:18:10] this body
[1:18:12] you cannot it's leaven that's why you
[1:18:15] got to wit the Redemption of your body
[1:18:17] you don't complete Redemption until you
[1:18:19] get a new body
[1:18:20] so if you sit here all happy and cushy
[1:18:23] where you're at
[1:18:24] in this body I doubt your experience
[1:18:28] as long as you're in this body you
[1:18:30] realize you got 11 laying right there
[1:18:31] with you and you're not going to rest
[1:18:33] till the leaven's out does everybody
[1:18:35] understand that that's what he was
[1:18:37] talking about Paul Paul wasn't gonna
[1:18:38] rest till he got rid of his body Paul
[1:18:40] went there did Paul
[1:18:43] they're going to take his body Paul said
[1:18:45] I ran the race
[1:18:47] stuck I don't even know if they ain't
[1:18:49] tied up knowing Paul stuck his old head
[1:18:51] in there
[1:18:52] didn't bother Paul at all he said death
[1:18:54] where's your sting Graves where are your
[1:18:55] eviction
[1:18:57] he was he was happy to get rid of this
[1:18:59] body I don't know about you but I'm
[1:19:01] getting weary of this body scripture
[1:19:03] says the bride is going to say
[1:19:05] and so Lord come quickly okay your
[1:19:07] daughter needed okay save them not
[1:19:10] everybody's gonna be in this Rapture
[1:19:11] some of you in this room ain't gonna be
[1:19:13] in a Rapture now there's no reason you
[1:19:15] can't be
[1:19:16] yeah man if you don't you're foolish
[1:19:18] virgin
[1:19:21] I told him in a church I said you know
[1:19:23] who you're interested in me is look at
[1:19:24] the person next to you
[1:19:26] the Baptist can't touch me no right you
[1:19:29] know the one who gives him the biggest
[1:19:30] fit the one setting here all right when
[1:19:33] he preaches the word and you won't
[1:19:34] conform to it you're the problem
[1:19:37] look out there yeah right it's you right
[1:19:39] man you're the problem right
[1:19:42] if you come under the if you come in
[1:19:44] obedience this message then you're not a
[1:19:45] problem
[1:19:46] right
[1:19:47] when he was the best thing you
[1:19:49] compliment you give him it ain't that
[1:19:51] car you got him
[1:19:53] it ain't patting on the back it was a
[1:19:55] fine message brother Samuel and then
[1:19:56] they leave here they don't become flesh
[1:19:58] right you see them go out the back door
[1:20:00] and do the same stupid thing you just
[1:20:01] preached right you know what you do you
[1:20:03] say did they even hear me right you know
[1:20:05] what we'll do we'll go home crying and
[1:20:07] say God they ain't even getting what I'm
[1:20:08] saying right
[1:20:09] it tortures a preacher when you don't do
[1:20:11] what he says it's not what I say I'm
[1:20:14] saying what the message says and we're
[1:20:17] 40 50 years down the road and you guys
[1:20:18] still ain't doing the things brother
[1:20:19] Branham said right
[1:20:22] people grow up
[1:20:25] I'm not being mean and I'm not trying to
[1:20:27] beat you down but it's time we become
[1:20:29] adults we lay aside our pride we let go
[1:20:32] of us and get God
[1:20:34] to where he's the four this message
[1:20:36] ought to be Uno when you're alive
[1:20:40] all right
[1:20:42] the first fruits they beat that three
[1:20:43] and a half barley no leaven they beat it
[1:20:46] with rods did they beat Jesus on the
[1:20:48] back it's a type of that they beat him
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:51] then they wave shaved it now the Lord
[1:20:53] had to accept it you know Jesus had to
[1:20:55] be accepted that sacrifice when he rose
[1:20:58] in the garden he said Mary don't touch
[1:21:00] me I've not ascended to the father
[1:21:02] did you wonder why you couldn't touch
[1:21:04] him until he was accepted right man
[1:21:06] because why Mary was she was born the
[1:21:09] same way you were she had living
[1:21:12] she'd have messed the whole thing up she
[1:21:13] said he said don't touch me I have not
[1:21:15] ascended to the father
[1:21:17] he was still doing the work of a high
[1:21:19] priest you couldn't touch the high
[1:21:20] priest once he was sanctified people
[1:21:22] could have gone oh shake my hand brother
[1:21:24] no he was Sanctified for service he had
[1:21:27] the blood put on his big toes he applied
[1:21:29] the blood all over the tavern you didn't
[1:21:31] dare touch that priest
[1:21:33] right
[1:21:34] right that's why the priest stayed on
[1:21:36] the outside of the door and Pilots oh
[1:21:37] they didn't go in because if they went
[1:21:39] inside there they'd have been desecrated
[1:21:41] they were fixing to do the Passover he
[1:21:43] was already Sanctified for that purpose
[1:21:45] right is that true exactly right that's
[1:21:47] why they turned him over the pilot they
[1:21:49] didn't want to have dirty hands either
[1:21:51] they had a law
[1:21:56] speaking of the children of Israel say
[1:21:57] to them when you come into the land
[1:21:59] which I've given to you and shall reap
[1:22:00] the harvesterof then you shall bring a
[1:22:01] sheep for the first fruits of your
[1:22:02] harvesting to the priest and he shall
[1:22:04] wave the way of sheath before the Lord
[1:22:05] to be accepted for you on the morrow
[1:22:07] after the Sabbath right remember Jesus
[1:22:10] died on Friday right three o'clock
[1:22:12] Friday afternoon they took his body off
[1:22:14] the cross at three and buried him before
[1:22:17] six because that was the beginning of
[1:22:18] the next day Sabbath began at six
[1:22:20] o'clock the Sabbath day was Saturday
[1:22:23] everybody agree with that that's right
[1:22:25] he said the day after the Sabbath the
[1:22:27] day that he rose
[1:22:30] so the first three is resurrection look
[1:22:32] people if you don't have a resurrection
[1:22:35] if you don't go through that feast day
[1:22:37] right
[1:22:39] you can still believe him no sure you
[1:22:42] could even be sanctified
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:46] but you know what you got to have a
[1:22:48] resurrection in your life
[1:22:50] if you haven't experienced threat you
[1:22:52] got to walk see what I'm saying you have
[1:22:53] to possess these things right it's just
[1:22:55] not God just didn't put that in their
[1:22:57] exes for a filler it's a type of things
[1:22:59] to come right okay
[1:23:03] Harvard and you shall bring a sheath the
[1:23:05] first region of harvest to the priest he
[1:23:06] shall wave the way sheep before the Lord
[1:23:08] to be accepted for you on tomorrow after
[1:23:10] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it so
[1:23:12] what Jesus was was that he had to be
[1:23:15] accepted to the Lord and the Lord said I
[1:23:17] like it there's no leavening in you I
[1:23:19] like what you're doing right right so
[1:23:22] there's going to be a crop after us now
[1:23:24] the difference is we weren't barley
[1:23:27] there was a difference between Jesus and
[1:23:29] you exactly you got to admit that right
[1:23:32] he was without sin there was no leaven
[1:23:35] in Jesus whatsoever there's no sin
[1:23:37] right
[1:23:39] but you do
[1:23:40] you got leaven in you your type of wheat
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:43] in the Feast of Pentecost is when that
[1:23:45] week comes for fruition and even that
[1:23:48] wheat that comes up gets waved over
[1:23:49] because they say this is what this is
[1:23:51] the best that come out of that crop do
[1:23:53] you see what I'm saying you're the
[1:23:55] you're the ones that's waved over you're
[1:23:57] the best of the crop there's going to be
[1:23:59] the church down there there's going to
[1:24:01] be ones that are good to the bride down
[1:24:02] there they're part of the crop but they
[1:24:04] don't come up and get waved over it
[1:24:06] right everybody got what I'm saying the
[1:24:08] type's there
[1:24:10] brother ribs seeing these things now
[1:24:11] we're going to go to the Feast of first
[1:24:12] they call it the Feast of Fert and see
[1:24:14] it's fruits plural Feast of first fruits
[1:24:17] does everybody see what it says
[1:24:19] it wasn't just one day it was one day
[1:24:21] but what the county of the Omer if
[1:24:24] you're in a 21st day it connected you to
[1:24:26] the first day
[1:24:28] yeah and if it's the 21st day they were
[1:24:29] going to come up to the 50th so what
[1:24:31] they call it is the Feast of Pentecost
[1:24:33] but it starts the county of the Omer at
[1:24:36] the day of first fruits every day they
[1:24:38] took a crop and waved it over it you see
[1:24:40] what I'm saying every age God pulled a
[1:24:43] crop off the Earth
[1:24:44] everybody got the type of that
[1:24:47] man and you know so with the church by
[1:24:49] the way I know you'll read in a minute
[1:24:50] I'll read it to you later when I get
[1:24:51] Trump but then said we've just ended
[1:24:53] that long Feast of Pentecost
[1:24:56] you know what he's telling you how the
[1:24:57] church ages I'm gonna be honest with you
[1:24:59] I'm not into church age anymore
[1:25:02] I'm in a jubilee
[1:25:03] jubilees outside of the feast that's the
[1:25:06] 50th day even though it's a part of it
[1:25:09] it's not in the 49. all right it's the
[1:25:11] 50. it's a jubilee right because
[1:25:13] everybody understands there were two
[1:25:15] different jubilees mentioned in the
[1:25:16] bible every seventh day was a jubilee
[1:25:19] every Sunday was a jubilee or at the
[1:25:22] seventh Year sorry seventh year was
[1:25:24] Jubilee is everybody right they rested
[1:25:26] the land on the 50th was a jubilee as a
[1:25:29] golden jubilee that Jubilee was
[1:25:31] different this Jubilee this Jubilee you
[1:25:34] went free but you didn't get your full
[1:25:36] possession back
[1:25:37] exactly if you if you sold your land off
[1:25:41] and you got Jubilee in the church ages
[1:25:43] you didn't have enough money to buy the
[1:25:45] to buy your full possession
[1:25:47] you're going to have to wait till the
[1:25:48] day of Pentecost to where you get it all
[1:25:50] back does everybody understand that look
[1:25:52] you were in bondage working for this guy
[1:25:54] for a dad but you only paid his debt
[1:25:56] back
[1:25:58] you couldn't pay the debt to get your
[1:25:59] house and every all your land back right
[1:26:01] so at the 50th Jubilee does everybody
[1:26:04] understand what I'm saying you come into
[1:26:06] full possession you got everything back
[1:26:08] we're here we get everything right Paul
[1:26:11] didn't get his full possession back
[1:26:12] Luther I read it they didn't get a full
[1:26:15] possession
[1:26:16] the full Productions or witness
[1:26:18] Redemption of your body we get tired
[1:26:20] we're in the age of the golden jubilee
[1:26:22] when all everything we're gonna all look
[1:26:25] there's no great ones among us at the
[1:26:27] day of the the Pentecost the Feast of
[1:26:30] Pentecost everybody in equal had
[1:26:31] everybody in Egypt or Israel had the
[1:26:34] same acreage when they first divvied to
[1:26:36] land up you got 48 you know in Oklahoma
[1:26:38] they gave the Indians 40 acres so if you
[1:26:40] were in a tribe they give you 40 44
[1:26:42] every one of the tribes they were all
[1:26:44] the same but the trouble is when they
[1:26:46] got into the land they got in debt
[1:26:48] that's the type of sin and they couldn't
[1:26:51] pay their bills so what they did they'd
[1:26:53] sell their land off
[1:26:54] and then after a while they'd sell their
[1:26:56] kid off you ever notice somebody that
[1:26:58] doesn't come out of the token all you're
[1:26:59] doing selling your children off
[1:27:04] I see you got the token applied
[1:27:06] you want to hear how you apply the tote

[1:27:44] getting out of the fourth dimension
[1:27:45] where's that coming from right you think
[1:27:47] God's pulling out of the fourth
[1:27:48] dimension I don't think so you better

[1:28:09] you might ought to do it right and I'm a
[1:28:11] dead shot with a shotgun I've won
[1:28:13] several state championships and I you

[1:28:17] here to blow it out of your front room
[1:28:18] and I guarantee you I won't miss it
[1:28:21] that's asking

[1:28:26] him blindfolded
[1:28:28] tear half your house out but I'll get it
[1:28:32] and the the what I wanted to bring here
[1:28:34] at the end of that there was leavened
[1:28:36] bread if you remember there was two
[1:28:37] loaves
[1:28:39] waved over them right but it was they
[1:28:41] had they said there's leaven in them
[1:28:43] right see we got 11 in us but at the end
[1:28:45] of the at the end of the the Pentecostal
[1:28:48] Feast there's two loaves it's Jews and
[1:28:50] Gentiles you know there's Jews in the
[1:28:52] bride
[1:28:53] the early church before 53 was Jews
[1:28:57] right
[1:28:58] they were part of the church they're
[1:29:00] going to be in a Rapture by the way
[1:29:02] right right
[1:29:03] right but they're they're they got 11 in
[1:29:05] them but their way but let me tell you
[1:29:06] something you know two things that kills
[1:29:07] Lebanon there's two
[1:29:10] salt
[1:29:11] and fire yeah
[1:29:13] what does the scripture say you are
[1:29:16] you're the saltier you're the ones that
[1:29:17] stopped the leavening in the land you're
[1:29:19] the only ones that can resist Lebanon
[1:29:20] you stop it
[1:29:22] you do you're the bride you stop the
[1:29:24] living
[1:29:25] and what's fire when you get the bad
[1:29:27] it's a Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:29:29] you know what stops the leavening of the
[1:29:31] loaf in you this guy what stops the sin
[1:29:34] in your life fire
[1:29:35] if you don't have the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:29:37] the fire that'll stop living if you
[1:29:39] don't have it you don't have the baptism
[1:29:41] Holy Ghost you can fall off a
[1:29:43] justification you fall off at
[1:29:45] sanctification the baptism holy ghosts
[1:29:47] are sealed you can't fall because when
[1:29:49] you once you put that loaf in the fire
[1:29:51] it will not raise anymore
[1:29:55] when you're cooking that it rises up
[1:29:57] when it gets as big as you want it you
[1:29:59] throw it in the fire
[1:30:00] it won't get any bigger not in the fire
[1:30:03] because the fire stops the leavening
[1:30:06] so there's only two things in this earth
[1:30:07] that's going to stop this leavening of
[1:30:09] sin we got here the fire god the salt in
[1:30:12] your life
[1:30:13] yield the salt of the earth you're going
[1:30:15] to stand in the way of sin amen you do
[1:30:17] that's what you think God didn't put you
[1:30:20] in a big position
[1:30:22] don't want it's the truth amen but they
[1:30:25] always preach Ruth in this did you know
[1:30:27] that
[1:30:28] go up did I read it yeah I hear it right
[1:30:31] here I want you to show you this real
[1:30:32] quick I got to go I know you guys can
[1:30:34] get mad if you don't get out here at 12.
[1:30:35] yeah
[1:30:36] God help me I'm going to Deuteronomy 23
[1:30:39] 22 a bastard chilling out here to
[1:30:42] congregation Lord even to his 10th
[1:30:43] Generation shall he not enter into the
[1:30:45] congregation of the Lord that's 400
[1:30:46] years
[1:30:49] an ammonite or a moabite shall not enter
[1:30:52] the congregation Lord even to their 10th
[1:30:54] Generation exactly
[1:30:55] shall they not enter the Congress Lord
[1:30:57] forever right now Ruth entered in she
[1:31:00] was an Amorite right
[1:31:01] the Old Testament says you can't go
[1:31:04] what changed
[1:31:06] you ever thought of that
[1:31:07] Ruth had no right to be there you know
[1:31:10] what brethramp said you should have
[1:31:11] burned on a servant you don't have a
[1:31:12] right to be here today
[1:31:14] but you know what happened to you what
[1:31:15] Ruth she said let your God be my God
[1:31:17] Naomi let your people be my people she's
[1:31:21] ceased being an Amorite at that hour
[1:31:23] I ceased being the son of Peggy and Ed
[1:31:26] weisinger when I said God you're my God
[1:31:31] I'll follow you through tribulation
[1:31:33] through the good times I'll never leave
[1:31:35] you and he said I'll never leave you
[1:31:37] either
[1:31:38] though so what do they do they read the
[1:31:40] book of Ruth they're in the Feast of
[1:31:41] Pentecost right remember Ruth came in
[1:31:44] there at the beginning of the barley
[1:31:45] season
[1:31:47] and she went all the way to the end what
[1:31:48] did she do what Justified her your God's
[1:31:51] my God right she quit Jesus to be an
[1:31:54] Ever right then because they knew her as
[1:31:56] an emperor or a moabite sorry moabite
[1:31:59] but they let her come in the children of
[1:32:01] Israel the priests knew that and let her
[1:32:02] come in but it's because of her
[1:32:04] confession
[1:32:06] her body fold her possessed her
[1:32:08] confession everybody get what I'm saying
[1:32:10] right right so if you look at that
[1:32:11] you'll say the Bible contradicts them no
[1:32:13] it don't it states in there right right
[1:32:16] she can she threw the world into things
[1:32:18] the world away that wasn't a real Ruth
[1:32:21] the real Ruth believed that Israelite
[1:32:24] message the real Ruth and that sir
[1:32:26] believes the message of the owl
[1:32:29] and that's what they do the Feast of
[1:32:31] Pentecost
[1:32:32] she went through justification she
[1:32:34] served and then she rested when he was
[1:32:36] doing the work of kids Redeemer she did
[1:32:38] nothing right she sat in the chair at
[1:32:40] the house right
[1:32:41] you know what I'm doing I've interviewed
[1:32:42] my rest right my rest dated Saturday and
[1:32:45] seventh day my rest is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:48] that's what it showed us seventh day
[1:32:50] there and Jesus brought it to a rest of
[1:32:52] the Holy Ghost but you got to walk
[1:32:54] through that and type you gotta walk
[1:32:56] through Ruth that's the part of
[1:32:58] redemption
[1:32:59] see I'm walking up and down the book
[1:33:01] Jesus was walking up and down to church
[1:33:03] ages I'm walking up down the bus
[1:33:05] he is the book and I'm the possessor of
[1:33:08] the book I ate it it's become part of me
[1:33:11] right
[1:33:15] okay
[1:33:18] yeah I know but I'm running out of time
[1:33:20] they're gonna kill me and you shall
[1:33:21] count into the from the more I have
[1:33:22] Sabbath for the day that brought sheep
[1:33:24] for wave offering which is the first for
[1:33:25] seven Sabbath shall be complete right
[1:33:27] and then on the 50th one was the Jubilee
[1:33:30] exactly and in that year Jubilee it
[1:33:32] started on the day of atonement it
[1:33:33] started on October the 10th right
[1:33:35] and that priest would get we'd blow the
[1:33:38] Jubilee trumpet at the Tabernacle first
[1:33:41] if I'm gonna preach a message I'm gonna
[1:33:42] go back to Tabernacle and preach it
[1:33:43] there first
[1:33:44] and then that priest got on this Little
[1:33:46] White Donkey and from a year from the
[1:33:49] time of atonement back to the next day
[1:33:51] of atonement the next religious year he
[1:33:53] wrote on that white donkey tooting that
[1:33:55] horn right everybody that heard it on
[1:33:57] that 50th year they've reached atonement
[1:34:00] they blew the trumpet everybody that
[1:34:02] heard it they could throw their trumpet
