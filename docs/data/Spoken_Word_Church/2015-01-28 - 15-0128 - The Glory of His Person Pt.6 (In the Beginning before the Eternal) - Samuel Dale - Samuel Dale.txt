Holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen you love him good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turnning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 we'll read that then we'll read John 1 and then we'll read from Romans 12 Revelations 1 John 1 and Romans 12 remember these that are out somewhere missing for different reasons brother dick Nim said there I think it was a battery on this car that didn't want to take a change try to jump off and then come on but you know so just remember that remember each one pray that the Lord would would bless each one and guide each one of us in his understanding and love remember now the Bible study will be uh the first Saturday in February so remember that and just come and be with us we have a good time in the Lord all right and also now the fellowship meeting will be here here on the third Saturday of March we haven't decided yet who will be the uh guest speaker but we will get around to that but just remember that on the third Saturday in March all right let's pray father we thank you for everything we thank you for your grace and your kindness thank you Lord that you are God and you change not and father then that way we can depend upon you to to be what we have need of because you've always been that down through time whatever was the need or the hour or what it was you came on the scene and provided so in this hour we have a very great need because we're facing many things facing uh old age facing many sicknesses that are in the world today facing horrible things around the world of things that are happening but we know who is the one that can take care of all all things we just ask you to help us and guide us now forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations we've been reading this we still haven't got the background yet to speak on uh the rest of what we've been trying to speak about the glory of his person uh but we'll get there eventually verse 10 Revelations 1 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia Asia unto a unto Ephesus and unto samarra and unto pergamus and unto Tira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto lady OA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks all right look and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to pouch with a golden girdle all right let's go over to John one because that's the one we've been using and we just use Verse 18 saying no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him now we want to get over to [Music] Romans and I want you to pay attention to the reading down to the point that we want to do I was going to just read one verse and and that but I got to look at it and I said no we better carry it all through because we will eventually uh get back and understand some things about what we're doing all right Romans 1210 be kindly affe affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord now it's talking about our everyday life and doings and what we are right rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributed to the necessity of the Saints give to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep now look what then it says be of the same mind one toward another now watch mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits all right you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now the point I want you to get is to think on Paul is laying all of this down and then he comes to to me to finalize it and to say all right now we are these things we are this we are that back up in the further in the chapter of chapter 12 but he says but cond to sin to Men of low State be not wise in your own conceits now we found out in our studies that the word condescend means to lower oneself from a position down lower into maybe another position taking that from condescend here 4829 to submit oneself to lowly things conditions Employments and things you know all right Webster says to condescend is to wave superiority voluntarily and assume equality with an inferior it means to STP stoop you know it means to descend but to wave superiority voluntarily and to assume equality or move down with one of being even inferior yes amen well I thought we believe that God's whole point was to creating man was that he could condescend downward you know and become one of us amen that's right I thought that was the understanding that we had of to point of seeing what God's great plan and purpose is to do to bring the great Eternal God down into a position I or whatever you want to say another form to where you and I can understand him amen right yes sir now what about the great Eternal doing this for you and I to condescend downward to where you and I are see he came in he he created us we I know all about that but then he came down to dwell with us that's right amen now that's you know I love that that's that's a great thing to me right all right now keep that in mind while we're going along and then you'll see why we read here in Romans where it says but condescend to Men of low estate in other words don't be lifted up be not wise in your own conceit don't be lifted up you know there's a lot of people think this world can't exist without them there was an old man up in New Holland cotton mill years ago he had a bunch of boys working there and he just thought he was in control thought he couldn't run without him and one day he got mad and went and got his boys and walked outside you know and he looked back and you know what they're still running he said I think we better go back inside you know and uh but a lot of people in this message think you can't get along without them you know especially preachers now they think that they're topnotch they got to do this they got to do that you know and uh you know they're not going somewhere if they're not preaching you know that's that's all right but now remember the point if we are supposed to to not look down on somebody like brother Brown said to baptism of the Holy Ghost uh make a a man with a man with a tuxedo on put his arms around one with a power overall something to that form or a woman with this fancy material dress you know hug up one in an old what do they call it Calico or something dress and call them sister you know and not think that they are of any greater value you know you condescend see and that's what God has done to you and I so that's what that's what I'm trying to get you to look at to help us to understand all right now we covered this past Wednesday dealing a lot with it of how that we made sure and even brought up a lot of the quotes that we had brought before on the message see I believe God is real you well God is just a Spirit Well now where did you get that from well the Bible says well the Bible says he's a being right the Bible says he has hands he has a heart the Bible says he has feet the Bible says he had a place to live H and see that's what we've been talking about even the prophet would bring out so many times that God is Not Like the Wind he say he's a being right all right he said he cannot on adoption in 1960 cannot be a being and then be omnipresent he abides in a place because he is a being why would you pray for the Holy Ghost if it's omnipresent that he FS every crack and crevice see he'd be in you he said right what's he trying to emphasize Fellowship 1960 why would you seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you if God is just like we think about him to be just floating around but he has a dwelling place because he's a being things that are to be 1965 can't be just like the wind over the Earth because he's a being he just isn't a myth he dwells in a place called Heaven you remember these it wasn't so from the beginning 1960 but God could not be just like the air is because God has a Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is a being we would see Jesus 19 57 God is just not like the air but he's a being who is this mzc 1965 God is a being he's not like the wind he dwells in a house but being omniscient all right he then can be omnipresent you remember that by being omnicient to know all things he knows where he needs to be and can be there to record as I always say he's not on the moon today if nobody's on the moon why be on the moon he he doesn't have to be all right but my point has been to you to get one thing to you that he's a being he's real it's not just to say well God's a spirit no man can see God well the Bible said where we read it there that the son which was in the bosom of the father has brought him out in the open or declared him right see then he's real all right now that's my point he's real but then when the Bible would make statements we try to figure that out intellectually without Waiting for God to bring it to us by Revelation by Spirit you know all right and in doing that we make up our own mind as to what God is and what's going on and what this is and that is and the Bible will make some outstanding statements you know like I've always said we don't believe in three gods or nothing like that but the Bible said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ that makes about five of them but it's never taught nothing like that that's our way because of the way that we put uh meanings to words and I want to get to that in a minute you know you put we put meanings to words uh they had a lot of problems with brother bram's message are still due in the foreign field of coming up with some of the words that he uses and I well remember see the the point that I was reading him when he was talking about that they would go out and they would go singing and they would catch the fish and I thought what is sing we call it sanning all right well see I did I had to look up see what that meant you know I'm not that smart I'm sorry you think I am a lot of but I went to the dictionary and found out what the word heat the way they spelled it and I found out it was the same old word we was using that we say we're sing in them Creeks but see we get it all figured out as that it's got to be that away all right and we we say well well there's no way that that can be right you know why because we have set within ourselves uh through our thoughts we have developed our our uh point of thinking you know and like I've always said to you about you know a horse is measured in hands well whose hands well you're just a dumb many don't realize that they meant like a 9 in hand well I'm just a dummy enough to say brother our lines was about 12 or 13 you know and you know I kidding Brother Ray while they go about it I said yours is kind of small compared to his well that's true but it's a way we have a figuring it out what is an inch you know I in C inch you misunderstand my pronouncing well that's what we figured out to be an inch we say it's a foot that that Pew is so many feet long well whose foot somewhere they developed a word that would have the meaning to uh you know in their culture their doings and things and then you go from America to an inch to Germany for instance and it's called what is it um it's not inches metrics metrics and then we go to pounds and they go to some other word you know well see it's because that we develop those ways of communicating what we are trying to talk about all right now I read you the statement there the other day we want to start back off right there again on it because it's a very direct way of understanding uh to me to be able to get a point so go ahead brother and pull up number one this is paragraph 55 through 57 who is this Mel chedic and look what he's talking about and he says now notice now his attribute and the attribute was first God the thought well like I said we get it all we're we're so spiritual now that word god should be translated to Elohim you know well why do that when we're supposed to know what the word god means right the word God just doesn't mean object of worship that's true that's what it means yes but it also means we can use it for the eternals the Elohim the self-existing right that's what I don't understand about people with their education the more education you get it's supposed to make you more simple right but it doesn't it makes the people big and like I always say you go up north not throwing off on the Northern people but go up North and you say what do you want for what do you want do I want some maters and ters they don't never ask you what you say it they go off laughing like crazy at you cuz they know what maters and ters are but then if I have sat down and they have said what do you want I said I want some tomatoes and some potatoes they said what do you uh your language is mixing you up a little bit what do you mean you want I want some maters and ters you get what I mean and see brother random will say something and and our mind is locked on that word instead of listening to the rest of what said that's right because we we've got it figured out so then we're going to translate it we need you know a new Bible we need all of these things we need to upgrade the message notice now his attribute then the attribute was first Elohim see we're straightening him out we're doing this that or the other we done lost a whole thought of what he's saying see the word God is in the Bible does have any problem with it all right Hebrews 1 even makes it in great big capital letters and says God in Su times and diverse manners he didn't have any trouble figuring out who it was but look the attribute itself all in one without being expressed okay now without being expressed okay then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us St John the first chapter and the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the Eternal now in the beginning but before the eternal that's not right un it's according to what you're thinking right you know I gave them and I'm not giving this a c of any point or anything I'm giving it to get a point in your mind that's exactly right and to me there's no better way of saying it than the way he said it that's right and when we get to the one in a minute where he said God was the first creation there's no better way of saying it you know what it done it confused the wise and prudent all right but let's stay on that just a minute in the beginning but before the Eternal you said but but Eternal but see who came up with the word Eternal come on in the Greek or the Hebrew one is one is Eon and the other is Aon and and then we go to the familiar one with all of us to use the word zoee but who came up with the word Eternal it may not have existed until maybe Moses used it first we'll just use that but you know that's about 3,000 years from the garden to there right 2,000 to the flood come on and when they came up with the word Eternal it was to express something amen right was to express what they were talking about so somebody developed the word we see then in other languages it has different meanings to it Zoe I use Aon and Eon because one of those is actually one of them is Eon which means Eternal one of them is a a word that runs right so close to Eternal until it's just but it's not Eternal is to not to be smart but just to tell you we do know a few things because I study things out you know when I hear it all right so the prophet said in the beginning well the beginning has a beginning now beginning has a beginning so it's a beginning where's the beginning he's talking about what is he simply saying what is simply the prophet saying that there was a time that we could not comprehend that's right in any form whatsoever the Eternal God right whatever you want to call him Elohim self-existing Zoe whatever you want to call it there was a time we couldn't do that but then back there he dwelt totally alone that's right just with his thoughts right and by being what he was he said well how could you express this person that never had a beginning never will have an ending how would you express that he said well the closest thing we've got to our concept of mankind and our thoughts is to use the word Eternal and the prophet would say in the beginning now if you'll listen to him on a lot of messages you'll get finally one thought in your mind this way he's doing he's not just using that right there is the only time he speaks so oddly as we would call it or maybe about the word beginning he said there was the beginning when they was nothing right and he said then we're going back there to the beginning and then he stops at a place and he says now they in the garden he said in the beginning and he says there's no time right right then he says well then they had seven days that on six days they created and he rested the seventh but there's no days counted at that time oh yes it was CU day one and day two and day three you ain't even listening time never began until the fall right you need those quotes or is that sensible enough right so the time beginning like we think about it begin there and God's thinking he was in the beginning and that was before the Eternal right right see we we've got to make now see get my point I tried to get it over the other day but I know it's not it's when you say Eternal you are making it something right no I'm not it's just oh come on like brother R said one time truth's hard to preach lies easy oh boy wouldn't it something back there was it father son Holy Ghost oh there was all there was three Gods back there and then one of them talked to the other one the other one said well I'll go down and I'll do this and I'll do that and we say we can understand that yeah it's a lie it's a fictitional story and all that touches your inward beings cuz there's no truth to it but what do you think about the word eternal then we say it is like a circle which signifies that it has no beginning and no ending that's words to explain that's right right when you made it a circle you made it something when you said God is eternal you made a word that develops your thought into words all right in the beginning but before the Eternal notice put it back up Brothers we'll read on look what he says about this before the Eternal this beginning this in the beginning but before the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word all right he says now we're getting to where this MDC you know was and look what he says about him he he is first being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met mzd I mean Abraham and was called mzd he was in the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes so now he's done used Eternal theophany and you know we'll keep ongoing that he uses the word logos and he uses the word Son of God right all right what about it what about all those attributes what about it go to number two and let's read it questions and answers on Genesis 537 7 [Music] 29 now if God created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of a man did he create now remember last Wednesday we emphasize that a good bit it says let us make man in our own image which was father and son that can't be two people but yet the man he creates is in the image of father and son that's right amen okay he's a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man you know the close reading of the scripture and he find he gives him Dominion of the cattle who has the Dominion of over all the things the spirit man he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself right now we got a word creation to deal with because a creation deals with a beginning right right that's right in our human terminologies of the word creation it had a beginning but he's not having any problems with talking about the first creation was God himself now once then out of now this is back before in this part we were talking about before the Eternal he hasn't come over to create yet he's describing what he was before he moved over to create come on get to get it right then see the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos we don't use the word theophany we don't use the word word which was the son of God now this is back before anything ever began and he says Son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of the Loos came forth the man out of the Loos Son of God theophany came a man and that man is the spirit man of Genesis one I mean know what it is you get over to two I think it is and you get to the physical man right all right just thinking about how a prophet can use these words so easily to him until it just flows you've heard him say I've got in my mind now we're standing upon the baners and looking over and watching all of this come into being I told you I said he done that way just like Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible Well he got it from God right all right and he was standing up there looking over the banisters you know in his mind thinking and he says in the beginning before the Eternal he said the first creation was God himself and out of God came the logos what is he saying simple simple terminologies what is he saying he's saying this is the only one way Humanity will ever understand the great Eternal God right and you see that Theologian sitting there knowing he knows his wording and what he's speaking but that Theologian says uh-uh I can't follow that line well give me your line well I I don't I don't know how to explain it but I don't agree with that now if you tell me come on you ever tell me you don't know how to explain it but I don't agree with you I'm going to tell you zip the lip because you're making a blabber that's right that's the best way to say it because you can't tell me I'm wrong unless you know I'm wrong that's right right yes sir you said well you're wrong well what you gonna do show me right you can't show me if you can't show me the truth that makes both of us wrong right that's right which that's what people are do I don't agree with brother Dale well show me where he's wrong well I I don't know how to explain it but I don't agree with him what you mean is your head's so big you can't shrink it low enough to listen to nobody else is that a good definition cuz if I tell you you're wrong you better believe I'll tell you why that I believe you're wrong cuz I'm not going to say you're wrong if I don't believe you're wrong and if I believe you're wrong I'm going to have the way to explain it right I'm going to at least say this this this this this don't go with it right all right but you understand but by using the word eternal we make it a starting point now listen to this when we say the word Eternal we're making it a starting point when the own the when our own word is condemning us because if it is eternal it had no starting point are you with me when you say Eternal you're making it a starting point when you say beginning you're making it a starting point when you say creation you're making it a starting point right and I thought that was the Revelation to this age that Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God you see why we don't know what the prophet is brought in religious matters or terms we use the word Eternal to signify ify that there has to be some way that this one that we're talking about has condescended into words right that's right he's condescending into the ability to be expressed by words amen that's right are you with me amen sure it took a prophet to get them words come on right but by him condescending the way he did to a lower level as we called it or whatever we read of Websters when the superior come down to rest with the inferior that's right right that's right amen we developed a thing called speech and you know is not odd that that's what the prophet would be saying he said logos he said that speech now come on folks who created all things right well God created all things he just God he just created all well why does the bible so emphatically state that the word was a Creator that's right and that Jesus Christ was that word that's right amen all right would you understand what I mean we use the word Eternal to signify that we have no way of understanding this but we've developed a word that will bring it into meaning that we can have something that means what we're saying Eternal well so the first creation was God himself out of the logos out of the god came the logos out of the logos came the Son of God which was the word no Son of God we use the word Son of God as a beginning point or son of a person or a baby born son daughter whatever meaning a person or something coming into being now brother brandham is using the word Son of God and he's definitely using the word Son of God is the creator you see why the trinitarians come up with it so much and say well they've got to be two there was a father and a son they've got be at least two so then we can call the Holy Spirit and make a three out of it one of these days we will understand why your Prophet said it like this he said and God sent his soul back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit right do you understand that right we'll get back to a lot of things we're not finished but why not think of the word Eternal as to think of it as that the great Eternal God is going to unveil himself is going to condescend downward and be able to express himself right see God is coming into being now you know what brother Brown said he said now there's no such thing as God sitting up there and he sees the world in sin so he questions around as anybody wantan to go down and said his son stepped up and said Daddy I'll go he said now that's trinitarianism he said he never sent a son he came himself that's right now you're not Trinity that's right but we could go to a Oneness church today and I watched him in Jamaica as I begin to talk of some of these things to him in that Oneness convention that I speaking there it's crazy how I wound up there but I did and you know they were just rejoicing I mean the things I'd bring out they were just rejoicing when you're sitting looking at wonder wonder in the world like God are saying and they were rejoicing over the things I was bringing out how that it wasn't that God sent a son but that he came himself right amen amen you know why there's rejoicing because that is West Doctrine you say are you saying brother BR said no no I'm not saying that now you don't be stupid with me brother R never taught nothing like that because you see I tried to illustrate it the other night with you and I wonder how many remembers it you remember the other night when it was brother brandom's quote all God was he poured into Christ all Christ poured into the church you realize what you just done if all God was poured into Christ and there is no God and if all Christ is poured into the church there is no God nowh but what's in you and you're right in the middle of the Devil's trap to try to make you think he's God well are you trying to correct brother Brandon no way I'm trying to not cause it but to get us to understand why would he be saying things like that but you see that's the problem we we we have to empty a place and move it over into another place and then we empty that that place and move it over into another why not leave it alone that's right why not leave it then that I can pray to my Father in heaven and know he's there right that Jesus could pray to his father and communicate with him see one of these days you realize what brother R's saying when he says let us he said father and son that's two people but it wasn't two people to him right see he never emptied a space he left it when you say all God was he poured into Christ you're exactly right all Christ into the church why listen do we believe the prophet do you believe the quote where he said that we would receive a message of cheer down through the endless ages after this world is over right do you believe that now that's what he said right so then just remember all I know you're going to say brother Dale you just interpreted it well what are you doing wake up sensible enough one time to realize what you're doing you're self-interpreting you interpreted what I'm talking about all that God was going to reveal to mankind in this world was put in Jesus Christ that didn't leave him out of it and all that would ever be revealed in this world was put in the church or is being put in the church now let's see if that's right see where's your scripture brother Dale all right according to the prophet in the the Revelations 1 we've been reading from when it says a revelation that God give Jesus to give to John he said there was things that Jesus you believe it didn't understand that's right he said didn't know when he's coming right right that's Bible no man knows the day nor the hour that's Bible and so then he said but at this present time when he comes to John O patmas he understands God he said he didn't even know his part in the Kingdom that's your words to your prophet he said but now he understands when he comes to John and can tell John these things what about telling John what would go in the second third fourth fifth and sixth seventh Church age before John was ever into the age at all ad 9596 that's somewhere pised in a little bit of Paul had some of the 53s of Paul right but he certainly didn't know what was going to go on in the next two or three ages seventh ages no but he did by Revelation that's right as Moses could write what had been John could write what will be are you following me then what do you think about it see what we're seeing is the condescending of the great Elohim self-existing one the revealing or condescending of that great Eternal one so that we can understand or see what he's been been doing okay let's read that now so go ahead with number three let's read this this is taken from Christ Min God revealed preaching 63 now God's Great secret mystery he had before the foundation of world now back in the back part of God's mind what about that one if you think brother random don't make some bold statements of understanding what is a theologian going to do when a man says back in the back part of God's mind well we can't even understand the front part right then you're going to go in the back part now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star atom molecule or anything he was God but he actually wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind now you know later what he said he created angels worship him all right made him God so in his great mind he created these attributes now excuse me let me reread so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and these are the attributes and him was to be father and him was to be son yes sir now this is back before the world cuz you got to bring the son into being let him create the world come on stay with me in what I'm thinking in him was love and him was to be a father and him was to be son and him was to be a savior and him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God now you know that I've always taught you and I believe it God never gained no attributes after he got here that's now you show me one he gained after he got here well I don't believe that Tak well show me one he got show me one attribut he displayed that he didn't have in him before the world and I'll show you one scripture I am God and I change not so you're making him change accusing me of being something and then what are you doing these attributes where these attributes in God to be a savior healer deliverer all of the things where they in God you've got the little drawing that Terrence gave you so if you would look at that drawing and I've done the best I can do to try to pick up a few things by doing it but just look at the little drawing that you have if you didn't get one raise your hand Terence give you one it's on the board now watch Eternal attributes while he was still in the beginning but before the Eternal see we think he developed these attributes as he came forth uh-uh now now that's making him change you're you're getting into the wrong situation he doesn't develop attributes he displays attributes right all right but look at his attributes was to be a father was to be a son was logos savior healer theophany Christ cuz see we we I don't even really didn't want to use this word Christ but and there'll be a couple of words I don't want to use but I will use them okay that don't make sense but does to me but see that word Christ we signify as being more coming into being through the Christ the angel of the Covenant uh you know and that's where he comes into being but remember you had to be Christ back there before the world ever begun he had all of these attributes and there's many many more attributes to be brought in I just wrote those out as a being where you can understand but all of that equals speech or word it was already there if not where'd it come from well it came into being you're not even thinking mentally if you can see something come into being you're seeing it displayed all right he came over here to display his attributes right all of these attributes was in this great person that we talk about to call him God Elohim self-existing um you use words yahs and things like that cuz those words are in the Bible but do you believe it that way well I don't really know where I believe well then do I need to reread again I just read from what we read that talks of theophany it speaks of Son of God it speaks of attributes it speaks of logos it speaks of theophany I didn't say that your Prophet said that and he said these are his attributes right and see he always had those attributes that's right just like you were in your daddy right as a germ of life you didn't develop in your daddy after your daddy got on up into age it's just like the prophet would say every Apple that was ever on the tree was in the seed that was put in the ground right all right are you with me amen yeah well brother Dale I can understand a little bit and I'm trying to express your thoughts cuz that's the way I think you know I try to use this old thing up here too that you can say well I can understand father I can L God savior healer theophany Christ you know but it's hard for me to understand that word son back there said because that would be bordering on the line of Eternal sunship and brother brandham said he didn't believe in that but you know what he said he believed in he said he believed in Eternal godship right that's well why you got a problem back there see that's where our mentality winds up and blocks out when we look at the word Sun can't you just see the point of what he's thinking now we're going to read some things is very interesting some of the things I'd never thought of sorry about that I'm not that smart I've always said that Jesus the son the Christ was the creator right CU there's nothing that the father created if the father created the son then you got too but if the son is the father made manifest in another form you still got one that's why you can even follow the DNA back in a family right you can see who you belong to because that's the DNA and see come on I found one the other day and I thought well that's pretty good cuz I've always I know I've heard the tape and I but brother Brown says he says now the body comes from the from the female the egg but see we don't believe that cuz we think in our mind the body comes from the sperm of the male no that is what gerti the egg the egg produces the body you see we've got it all figured out but have we what are you looking at it can you see what I'm talking about he had all of these attributes in him and just to bring it down to a point of saying all of these equals out to be the word well on the other side you see identically except for the top where it says Eternal but before the then in the beginning but not in time not when time begin to to do you see him standing back there as he moved over over into the position to be able to create he would be called The Son of God now you got Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 John 1 Revelations about four uh you got many many more James 3 and9 and no excuse me Ephesians in that all things were created by Jesus Christ cuz see the father didn't create that was the key but the son that was on the other side doing the creating was the father that stepped over into the form and became word speech not that he couldn't talk back here that's where we missed the whole thing we want to try to make something like this tangible and then think of God just being a spirit that just floats around I would have no problem whatsoever if brother brandom but I've never found it so I'm saying I wouldn't but I would have no trouble if he said back before there was any of this eternal ever started any thoughts about it that God lived up there in a great big city I would have no problem with that because he dwelt in a place right he was a being if you understand what I'm driving at this is a being right this goes down to bringing that being into existence and it takes 6,000 years to bring that being into existence but I believe it's Christ of mystery I'm not certain I'll find it for you but he said the only way he could be a father the way he wanted to be was to be the son of man right that's right that's what he saying that's right why because the son of man is one to release the life that could come into you and I to bring us eternal life that's right how you not release that life you and I wouldn't be the children of God so he spoke his own children into existence that's right if you don't believe that go back there in the scriptures where he said he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost we spend all of our time arguing over when that happened and know that it didn't happen before Calvary brother Brown said it was a promise to come instead of thinking about what was taking place he actually FOC us into existence that's right amen cuz we are his offspring amen we are the children of God sir why can't we believe it that way we was talking the other day about some of the people a lot of people back years ago didn't pay no income tax always paid mine ain't never had no problem come find out Jesus Paid taxes you remember for him and Peter that's right which you know there's people in this message didn't believe in paying taxes you know what now they can't draw no social security whoe I'm glad they can't sorry for the people that's hungry but I'm glad they can't cuz they didn't pay they had this great Revelation you know what the Revelation was Jesus said does the children of the king pay taxes see they say the children of the king don't pay no taxes said I'm a child of the king I don't pay no taxes that's a spiritual Kingdom that's not a physical one so they didn't pay no taxes now they can't draw and ain't just a few people in this message there a lot of them and I told him then I said well you know kind of odd Jesus Paid taxes he told Peter to go get the fish and pull out the money go pay the taxes for you and myself and he was the god he was not a son you know right he was not the son of a king he was the King right the king paid taxes he said give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's that's Bible but said unto God that belongs to him right amen we're talking about a spiritual King this is not a natural Kingdom Jesus said if this was a natural Kingdom paraphrasing his word he said my subjects would fight right you see we've got it all figured out and those poor old people now are in bad shape because they can't draw any Social Security because they didn't pay in any well you know what a lot of them is going to figure out a way to get up on welfare and you know who's paying for that like my got works on a car I won't call his name but he uh not daing him Gils he said my sister said she's had three babies by Three Men and don't know what daddy is the daddy of who and said you know what I heard the other day she's pregnant again said I jumped on to her at Christmas said she got mad run out of my house I said I was laughing that he said she got mad at me said she said well the government's paying for he said honey you are the government I'm paying for your babies he said said she got mad and left the house but okay do you see what it is go to number four let me read just a few of these and then we'll get to point and quit on that we'll stop on these attributes this is taken from the message investment 196 3 paragraph 17 he talking about the compound names and thing for the great attributes of God before that before he was even God before there was God is an object of worship before he ever become that he was still God he is eternal and these attributes was in him is that enough and they're just display themselves as being a father and a son a savior and it's just in we're enjoying those things right going to the next one let's get a few of these where you won't be saying it's just one quote go to number five we got Josiah and Zach back there running these things and you know what I told him a while ago I said while I'm preaching scan that audience every once in a while I said try not to pick out the ones that's asleep you might be frowning and smiling at the wrong time and be on internet okay but look what he says off of the message what that's supposed to be number five which is God's provided way of approach to Fellowship in 1960 says Genesis one in the beginning God the word go God the that word there in Hebrews is El Elohim and all in the alls sufficient one the self-existing one the strong one and in him was attributes to be father and him was attribute to be son and him was attributes to be Savior and him was attributes to be healer and him was attributes to be God there was nothing but God and God Alone now these attributes was in him so that made it display something to worship Him the first thing he made was Angels okay go to number six which is the unveiling of God 1964 notice he never changed his nature sure sir if I were you if I were you and say you're dependent upon the way that I bring things I would write on the top of my notes a very important word here now is being used of the N or the word nature I would write it on top of my notes to keep it because eventually we'll get back to that cuz never changed his nature that's right only his form Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever so he did not change his nature when he come he is always that Prophet watch all down to the age same thing the word the word the word the word the word and see he cannot change his nature but he changed his form Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever he just changed his mask his form all right so here was the father now don't look at empty spaces and leave empty spaces remember the point here was the father back in the beginning before the Eternal he steps over into another form called a son that's no problem that's what your Prophet said that you said you believe while ago when you said yes that's right that he didn't send a son he came himself well why don't you believe he came himself just don't empty spaces and leave I I get you know these people make these big fancy drawings and they'll make it and they'll oh all God was and then they see they leave this empty well I know right then they don't know what they're talking about cuz the more of God we get over here here makes him more right right am all right he changed his mask look what he says on the Mighty God unveiled number seven he goes through scoffield and the words you know that he uses as a form we find the word IM morphe in Greek we find that his word changing from form we find the word imorph in the Greek which means the Unseen was made visible something that cannot we know it's there now anybody one ey in high sense or know somewhere they had to be a God to begin with you can say well it was a polywog it turned out well where did the polywog come [Music] from well it's just what's that other word Gary uh it's uh energy It's Just Energy well where'd that come from because scientifically proven energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be harnessed that's scientific fact right so if it's energy he was back before energy that's right he existed before energy all right which means the Unseen was made visible something that cannot we know it's there it can be cannot be seen but yet we know that it's there and when he changed his form of the amorphia which means that he changed from Supernatural to natural and he just changed his mask in other words it's like a drama he was acting in the Greek when they would change their mask maybe one player you know one player might have acted in several different parts he just changes his mask he never changes his nature right that's right do you believe that amen do you believe he never changes his nature cuz if he changed his nature it wouldn't be Hebrews 138 that's right right right and he wouldn't be uh what is it Malachi 3 where he said I'm God and I change not now if he changes anywhere in any of that he can change his form to another form and appear is that that's where people how their trouble there on the river here stood the sun here come the pillar fire here come the D and the voice out if that had not been you would went into Oneness remember Oneness is like his finger remember one means oh God was he stepped into Christ all Christ he stepped into the church that's Oneness right that is Oneness cuz one on this is like your finger and all the the god that stepped out they rejoiced when I said the great Eternal never sent his son you would have heard 300 one this people screaming at those things that God never changes he just changed his form the only one they backed up on was mzc they couldn't swallow that too easily and for three nights in a row I preached on the godhead and got a whole lot more respect out of it even told them women preachers I didn't agree with them and they invited me to come and preach in their church here you can't even go preach nowhere all right those attributes he changed his form to morphe like a drama he's acting it out and thing uh I'm going stop right there cuz if I go any further or going into other things we'll pick it up next Wednesday won't have no trouble but if I was you I would ask you to do I've asked you to do it I've asked you to listen read or whatever questions and answers on Genesis that's all I've asked you to do to see where the Prophet is saying these things or not but make sure you get what I'm talking about for a second and then we'll have musicians to come remember we're not Oneness so then all that would step over here and leave nothing over there come on you're getting into Oneness Doctrine and brother brandom was definitely not a Oneness right when he said all that God was to me that means all that God is going to make known was revealed in Jesus Christ and there'll be a message of cheer down to the end of ages do you think you're going to heaven and going to sit up there and not learn about God what kind of a God have you got he said a message of cheer down to the endless ages after we leave here an eternal partaking he said of the word we're just getting enough here to be able to understand when we get there did you see all of those attributes was in him before he ever came across that line as we would call it to begin to do anything and we'll pick it up next week when he comes across that line he comes across that line and brother brandham says now listen he said he had in his mind what he wanted to do you better read and listen because that he that he's talking about you read and see we'll prove it next week that he he's talking about is the son that's why I'm not a trinitarian but I'm not a Oneness doesn't bother me for a river Jordan I mean yeah don't bother me for a river Jordan EXP experience to take place they don't bother me because I'm not a Oneness and not of not Trinity don't do away with the forms of God are you listening just because he Chang his form doesn't do away with the form now come on me and my wife I used to be just a Snick of fren of a kid right had attributes in me I had to have somebody to help me because those attributes could never been displayed those genes those genetics and things so one day you know what I got married and I got somebody to help me display my attributes right brother Ray and you wind up with children that are your attributes and you know what there's so much your attributes until the DNA will prove it I looked in the paper the other day and it's so wonderful to think about they're solving crimes today that was committed 40 years ago that finally got to the people to where that they had the they had the DNA material laying but they didn't know how to use it it was in the paper just this week how many cases they had solved and turned the people loose because the DNA proved they were not guilty that's right it's a wonderful age in a lot of things let's stand he doesn't change his form I mean his nature he changes his form but don't do away with any form I am a father I'm a son I'm a human I've got many many manifestations to me but I'm only one person that is doing that but my wife does it she does it you know how that's done but I'm not her daddy the children say Daddy the grandkid says Poppy the great grandkids they just follow them say poy you know anyway but you know what I'm talking about to think about what he has done and revealed to you and I now here's the one that always comes up in my face and does brother Dale do you think we believe to know do you think we need to know these things you do not want to know about your God you would tell me you don't need to know about your God people spend a million dollars to try to find out where their daddy was at and the Old Goat run off and left them when there was kids I wouldn't hunt two seconds for somebody like that but people spend millions of dollars to try to find their true parents you mean you don't want to know about your daddy you don't want to know know about the one who created you and brought you into being you don't want to know about your savior you don't want to know about your healer you don't want to know about your deliverer the only thing I got to say is altar is open you need to baptism with the Holy Ghost right because if that's where you are then you certainly need something to help you I want to know more about my daddy I didn't get to know about my daddy you a lot of you are a whole lot different now he about four years old I was when he passed away I have very little Rec condiction in my mind about anything but I you know what someone would start talking about him or something I remember my sister and it tickled me to death she was talking about and it was bad but said that she got mad at a boy on the school bus because said they looked out the window and said ours old Sam ain't worth a put the big word out there and she said I floored him said wasn't going to talk about my daddy like that well you see why I get upset and a lot of people talk about my daddy and try to make him three or one or some kind of something or belittling he chose if you notice the definition voluntarily to come down to be with us what a wonderful thing that's right and I'm so glad he's my God and you you don't understand you'd have to be in the position of others and you think it but sometimes when the things are running the worst and things are grow going the worst it can be that's when I pray Lord what do you want me to know what do you want me to know Lord I'm being whooped on every side I'm being Beat to Death I ain't praying Lord you just get on them people start whooping on them no I said Lord I I want know what's going on you just forgive them because the prophet said to you our people to say things to just to see what you'd react you know Lord help my reactions to be right let me be right Lord just forgive me and also know that right in the middle of that he's going to reveal he's going to reveal something to me you can be the lowest you are if you'll go just open the Bible or the prophet's message I've been so low until I couldn't read you ain't never maybe been that low I guess I've been so low I couldn't pray I've been so low I couldn't think but walk in the study and sit
