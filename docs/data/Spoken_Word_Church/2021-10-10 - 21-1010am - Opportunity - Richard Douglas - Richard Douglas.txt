========================================

what more can we say about the grace of god unmerited favor with god man what a privilege it is to serve a god that when a count us is worthy worthy to carry his gospel worthy to stand for him in this hour that we live in i tell you what honor it is we we need to thank him for that honor he's given us and the privilege he's given us to be able to center the unadulterated word of god for this hour what a privilege it is to hear what god has said to us in this day please give us an ear to hear and a heart to receive we're so thankful for his mercy and grace we send greetings from brother josh bennett he sends his love and appreciation to brother sam and the church and we sure appreciate each and every one of you you can relax i'm just your friend amen just who i am and god made me that way and i'm happy that way amen i'm thankful for this opportunity we sure love and appreciate you sure thank you for the thank brother sam and the church for this opportunity to be here but most of all i'm thankful he's here he's the difference maker amen he's the one that he's the one that changes everything he's the one that he's the one that just one word from him it changed everything change our lives heal our bodies bring us up closer to him that's the one we've invited this morning we want to make him welcome here in this service that he might might be so welcome that he be pleased to walk and minister to us today because he knows exactly what we have need of i have no idea what you need but he knows exactly what you need and how you need it and i like what brother dan daisy said one time he said he said god's ministers are like lifesavers he's got a flavor for everybody you know and i thought about that and i said well you know when i was a kid i liked the cherry ones but i never did refuse a lifesaver when they gave me a piece of candy amen could we turn to the reading of his word this morning turn with me to the book of matthew chapter 19 i want to start reading it verse 16. i want to talk this morning by the grace of god a little thought on opportunity i want to talk about the opportunities that we have and how we ought to take advantage of the opportunity we have to and the things we god offers us and we've got so many benefits that he's given us and we're thankful for his grace he said and behold i started verse 16 it says and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i shall i do that i may have eternal life wrong question what good thing shall i do it says and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments and he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and the young ruler saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said jesus unto his disciples verily verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god father lord jesus there's only one way father and that's you and father we're standing at the door this morning lord you and i'm asking you to let me enter in that door lord enter in that door that you the people will not see me but they'll see you lord father i'm asking that you'd come lord and anoint me lord you take control of my mind you take control of my spirit lord you take control of my mouth lord i give myself completely to you lord that you might lord have preeminence lord in this service this morning oh god i don't want to make a mistake with this opportunity we have this morning lord father i pray lord god that you just used me in a mighty way that you speak lip to ear to your children father we ask you to do these things lord in the name of jesus christ our savior amen and amen you may be seated we see here that this the rich young ruler he had a had a great desire he knew within himself that there that there was a way to have eternal life but he thought it was in his own way of thinking i believe what he thought by his own thinking was the way he asked this question what must i do what must i do what can i do to and he he asked that question and what he needed to do was ask the lord what what would you have me do not what i can do but what would you have me to do you give me he come to the opportunity of life and to eternal life and he walked away you know we look at that many times and look at it as that way but look at the many times people have come to jesus come to this message which i believe this message is nothing more than jesus christ have come to this message had the opportunity to have eternal life and to go in the rapture and turn to walk the way because it was too hard for them the questions he asked for them to do but i've now and then you talk to many people and they say you know the one thing about they try to say about the message it's such a hard thing it's it's so many do's and don'ts but when i come to this message i've never seen it never made me feel that way brother samuel it was a doing it don't it was a want to when you fall in love with jesus christ it's no longer you do or dawn as you want to he took away my want to to do the things of the world and put a desire in me to want to serve him and to praise him and to give him all adoration and all love and everything i could give him because he gave me an opportunity it gave me an opportunity in this hour when the world's falling apart everything's going haywire he said i've given you the opportunity i've give you a place i've given you a city of refuge that you can run there and be saved david said he is my refuge i can run he's my tower he's the rock and the cleft he's everything i can run into him and i can be saved that's the only saved pavilion we have in this hour god has given us this opportunity to come into him and to be perfect we are perfect in christ we are he made us perfect through his word he sent us a perfect word what do we do with this word that he's given us i like what brother brown preached a message what shall we do with this one name christ you know you know brother brown said every time we come to church we have the opportunity like we are in pilates hall to either receive the word of god that you're hearing or to reject it and i'm thankful that god is placed we'll be so thankful for the opportunity that he's given us the heart to receive the word of god to have a receiving heart to accept it and say god lord i can't figure i can't explain everything i can't figure everything out but oh god there's something on the inside of the inside that says that's nothing but the truth that is nothing but the truth that's what this message did when it come to me it proved to me that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the unchangeable god what is the opportunity it's a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something see this man had oh my god he had an opportunity he had the same opportunity that me and you had he come right up to life come right up to eternal life and he said he he's seen that what it was he'd even and said i've done all these commandments i've kept them i've held them i've done this and i couldn't even say i can't even say that in my life i've not kept all the commandments from my youth but you know what he said my grace the blood this opportunity i'm going to give you an opportunity even when you failed and you made a mistake i'm going even though your sins be as scarlet i'll make them white as snow if you'll accept my propitiation for your sins what an opportunity to become spotless without a wrinkle without a blemish that's what this message come to do is to prepare a bride for a rapture and i believe it's doing just exactly what it said it would do problems said how does god how does god fulfill his word he brings it to pass you are you are what he has spoken of this morning you are that lady you're his wife you're the one that he has chose to carry the cross in this age and i don't want it half hardly i don't want to take it for granted i don't want to just slip in as people would say get in by the skin of my teeth i want to go in shouting i want to go in and sing and i want to go in praising i want to go in with the victory saying god you have caused me to be triumphant in this age god has given us the opportunity in this age to flourish because he has sent us light in the evening time and the light is what is bringing forth the maturity of his wife the word of god you were to think that when he you were to think that was a good thing that he was said when the rich young ruler told him he said i've done these things i've kept them from my youth you would have looked at the outward appearance and think well he's he's done all these things he he expected something a different response from jesus christ than what he got he expected him to pat him on the back and tell him you're a good old fellow you're going to make it because of works you've done but what he was telling him it's not the works that you've done it's the works that i'm finishing you're going to go because of me and if you'll obey me and it's a paradox because he give us faith to believe this message brother donny and then rewards us for believing this you talk about a package deal what a package deal we have in jesus christ what a package we have in this message it's eternal see we why satan is fighting us and against us because we don't have an expiration date and he does his time is expiring he is siren right now he is going to the lake of fire his time is done with it he's given him the most power he's ever had but the bride of jesus christ is still standing because of the opportunity she has received through this message oh hallelujah what a privilege he missed his chance many are missing their chance missing their chance or opportunity to receive life because he had great possessions my goodness what is great possessions here brother and says it's all going to be atomic father he's showing us he's warning us through this that whatever is between me and you and god will hinder us from going any further that's why he is allowing us to see these things in the scriptures what an opportunity that's why paul said lay aside every weight that so easily beset us and let us run this race with patience oh my it's not to the swift it's not to the strong it's to them that endure to the end shall be saved and he has given us enduring power when we have received the baptism of the holy spirit we will endure to the end satan has taken the most of his opportunity he said how set in the synagogues of god and be worshipped as god he's done it he said i'll be exalted and he's done it but what about the bride she's doing just what god said she would do she'll stand on the word of god and shall not move except for thus saith the lord he said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow what an opportunity to hear his voice with all the voices in the world of politics and this voice and that voice and these things but that still small voice look at the opportunity elijah had the thunder didn't move him the lightning didn't move him the rain didn't move him but when that still small voice spoke he recognized it and come out he said i've got the opportunity the master calleth me oh hallelujah brother brown said many move at the thunder many move at the lightning many and move in the rain he said but the thing is is to move when the voice of god speaks what i believe is the failure a lot of times around the message is the failure to see the voice of the son the opportunity of the voice that he has given us in this hour to receive his voice and to know who it was speaking a lot of people said i i heard i like what brother brown said said one man was listening to his tape and he said he called me a buzzard the other man said he called me an eagle that's what this rich young ruler found out he called me a buzzer because i failed to obey the full word of god he said sell all you have give to the poor pick up your cross and follow jesus what an opportunity for god to give you what is this what in this world is worth that well how can you buy it where can you go get it there's only one place and that's jesus christ and he stood right there at the opportunity right there at the door and the door was oh hallelujah glory to god the door was open inviting him to come he says too hard too hard for me it's a hard thing that's what many have found out they said it's too hard but i said oh my jesus when i fell in love with you you made it easy even through the hard times i can still say thank you lord for all you've done your grace has been sufficient for me oh hallelujah even when that when that minister of satan buffeted paul blow after blow after blow he had the opportunity to just say it's too much i can't take it i'm going to throw the towel in but what he'd received was more than the pressure that was coming upon him he'd received a tie post he'd received jesus christ as his savior and the lord gave him the answer he said my grace is sufficient that's what he's telling us through this pandemic and all these things he's telling you my grace is sufficient my mercies are new you know yesterday you may have thought maybe brother bob that you'd wore it out it was over with everything was gone it's no hope but he said they're new this morning all right i'll give you a brand new set of mercy i'll give you the opportunity to stand again oh hallelujah ain't you thankful for the grace of god and she's thankful for the message he's given us oh what a mighty god we serve he tells us what amazes me is that here satan and god have a conversation and they begin to talk about this man named job this man named job said there's none like him none like him brother sam nothing like him in all the world have you considered him oh yeah i've been looking at him a long time you know he's flourished prospered his health's good everything's going good i can't touch him you got a hedge around him he said but if you'll let me touch him i'll make him curse you he said then do whatever you got to do but don't take his life because i have the power of life and death and what amazes me is here this comes on joe here's a and here here is this opportunity oh my god gives us opportunities to glorify himself he said you here he is do what you want to with him he knew that what job had would hold him he already knew satan said no if i take away all of his worldly goods and all of his health and his family he's bound to curse him but i like when the when the man come running and they started telling him your children are dead your camel's is gone this is gone all that's gone you know he never you know what he did it amazes me he fell on his face and he worshiped god he said this is my opportunity to praise god for his love and mercy for me and look at the words that come out of his mouth he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord in a time of giving and taking he still blessed god no matter what comes upon us we have the opportunity to say blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord thank you for all you've done for me thank you for your hand of mercy thank you for my family thank you for my church thank you for my pastor thank you for jesus oh hallelujah i've got so much what an opportunity to praise him david was not a man you had to pump up to get him to come to church he said i was glad when they said unto me he was already primed for the pumping you know what that's that's the opportunity we had this morning when we come to church are we already primed for the pumping a lot of times we want the preacher to pump us up but we've put no water we've not struck water in the whale yet so it makes it hard on the man to pump a dry whale but people that's been praying and reading their bible and studying and come with the joy of the lord excited about the word of god saying this is my opportunity to thank you jesus to worship you to praise you for your grace and mercy [Applause] and it just flows smooth you know what it's not all about what he does for us he may have come this oh my glory be he might have come this morning brother sam wanting to drink from your life he might want to drink from your whale this morning i'd hate for him to walk up and find no water of joy no water of peace no water of love no water satisfaction he said oh i remember david the desire of him said if i could just get a drink from that whale in my seba and his and they didn't commission his soldiers to do that and they fought through all those philistines to get down there to get him a drink because it was the opportunity for them to come and bless the king oh my oh if you come this morning to bless the king have you come to offer him a sacrifice of praise and worship and honor what an opportunity you know what we're losing our opportunities there'll be no excuse for us this is just this brother says go come to a place brother said this will be but just a fond memory they'll shut the doors why not take advantage of the opportunity now to get what god has for us we don't have to come we don't have to leave empty we can leave full and if we come full of the world this is our opportunity to empty so he can fill us oh hallelujah we see that what brought jesus on the scene after the look like everything he taught and everything he'd it fell apart and all these things was happening and he'd been crucified and he'd been in the grave for those three days and looked like it was all over and here was two men walking back defeated brother look like you know what looked like the message had failed them huh look like everything they thought it failed them but you know what what brought him on the scene is they begin to talk about him that's our problem we don't talk about him we have an opportunity every day to witness about jesus christ and when i wake up i say oh god who can i witness to this morning who can i speak to lord who would you have me tell about you today you know what brother they said brother braham every time he never missed his opportunity to glorify god to tell people about his savior he said we shouldn't be ashamed what a privilege that he would call us sons and daughters of the living god what an opportunity we have as sons and daughters of god some people are looking for a jesus with skin on him you might be that very one that can get that last one to come home to jesus look at the opportunity we have let us not shine our our our position in christ but they begin to talk about him in their broken down way you know what have you ever been discouraged or going through this battle and you start listening to a tape or start talking or praying or thinking about jesus and here he comes that's why he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll even be with you even in you to the end and what did he do he didn't just come and tell him who he was right off he began to take him to the scriptures he began to take them to the scriptures and he began to tell them did not these things supposed to have been was there not supposed to be a sacrifice given for the sins of man was not he supposed to do these things and he just they got to their house and you know what a lot of times we are in church and he's talking to his men and you know what we get to the house and we're heading home and he's still missing to us and we don't constrain him just come on in the house with me lord don't go on down the road i don't want to leave you i don't want you to leave me lord i want you to and they said they constrained him to come in and fellowship with him and as he be and as he began they asked him to break break oh hallelujah communion with him and you know what they said and he'd done something and they knew it was him brother donnie i believe he was breaking that bread and it just become a whole loaf again and he broke it again and it was still a whole loaf and he broke it again they said it's him it's him it's the master he's alive and that's what the prophet said he said you'll know when god is speaking through a man by the way he breaks the bread the way god uses him to break the bread you'll recognize it's not man speaking but it's god speaking through a man they didn't miss their opportunity they went back and said look he's alive we've seen him he's not dead oh hallelujah what an opportunity we have this morning to glorify god to worship him in spirit and truth to thank him for his gracious love and mercy first thessalonians 5 21 says prove all things hold fast to that which is good i tell you what when god showed me this message i seen more than a man i seen god speaking through a man i seen god ministering to my soul i heard more than a man's voice i didn't hey i heard jesus christ speaking to my soul he said come and abide with me oh and hallelujah once i went into this pavilion this this refuge of jesus christ i've never wanted to look back never wanted to go out i even when when you do people don't understand the slayer is still outside you're still guilty without the atonement the avenger of the blood still desires to kill you to take your life and he has the right to do it that's what happened to eve reverend said she stepped out from behind the protection of the word you're no match for him get it out of your mind you're not the champion jesus is the champion he's undefeated and i'm glad he set refuge for me and you to come into and i hear that i'm not listening to joab's messengers that's what happened to abandoner is they started he had uh he was safe abner was in the city of refuge and joab could do nothing to him even though he had killed his brother and he had the right to avenge his brother but he was in the city if he were to stay there he could not have got him but he sent messengers in that's what satan's tried to do in this message send messengers in he's satan's trying to take the most of his opportunity he sent messengers in he said come on out johanna wants to talk to you he said forget all that we're friends let's make a covenant let's be let's be friends that's what satan is not your friend he still hates you and he listened to him he listened to him brother cairo he listened to him and he went outside and there he was the slayer joe had killed him and the bible said that abner died as one of the foolish men of israel because he stepped outside the protection you don't think when you step up from us from behind this message that you're going to see the avenger of the blood i hear him all the time calling come on out it's over i won't bother you no more i'm your friend come on back you know what i do to him i stick my tongue out at him no no no you can't come in and i can't go out i don't want to go out problem said once i come into this city i have never wanted to go out that's why i wonder why many people brought sam complain in here complaining about well this is that's not the way i think it'll be here this i said you don't have no you're a prisoner you don't have a thought coming you you don't have any you don't have no say in this i'm glad i don't because hey people say i want to give you a piece of my mind i said you ain't got nothing to waste i i i don't want you i don't want you to give me a piece of your mind i want you to give me the word give me the word we're not here for opinions or people's thoughts or people's own interpretations of the word we're here for truth and this message set me free even though i'm a prisoner of love i'm free they say well you come out here you can do what you want to i said dude i want you anyway i want to serve god i want to praise him i want to glorify him i'm doing what i want to do leave me alone you do what you want to do i'm doing what i want to do let's serve the lord god with all my heart all my might and all is within me i want to praise his name i want to bring glory to him i have no desire to leave neither will i listen to anyone else who tries to beckon me to come because i've come too far brother to turn back now i said i see nowhere to go i have no bridge to go back across he'd burn it thank god he burned it and you know what he didn't even give me a towel to throw in thank god that he didn't give us a towel to throw in he said he who has begun a good work will finish him and i said lord thank you for that and when satan tries to battle me with my health and different things i said satan i'm a work in progress i said i'm he's working his perfection through me he's showing that there's going to be a bride in this age i don't care who walks away who turns back by god's grace i'm here to stay i'm here for the end duration of it all i'm gonna whether they take my life whatever they do they shut the doors i'm still gonna press the battle i'm still gonna believe what if they take everything you got i don't have nothing when you give your life to christ you have nothing i like what the one the one of the fellows in the fox's book of martyrs said when they went and rung him before the king and they told it said they brought him the king and the king he told the king the king said what if i he said i i have the power to take your life he said if you don't denounce the name of jesus i'll take your life he said o king i died years ago it stunned him because god always he said take no thought what to say in that day he said i'm already dead we got to be that dead we got to be that dead and say hey what is this man he's giving me nothing but trouble it'll be an honor to lay my life down for the king he laid his life down for a sinner like me what an opportunity if that's what he desired for me to lay my life down for him that don't scare me death don't scare me i'm not afraid of death it's just a cart i told a brother the other day i said if death would take me i said i'll have the whip and i'll beat satan all the way across the river to jordan i'll say let's go boy i'm going home he has no power over a believer we don't die we go in to god's glory he said well what if i take everything you own he said oh king i don't know nothing i give it all to jesus stunned the king i could just see his look man this guy's dead and he has nothing he looked over to his advisor and said what do you do with a man that's dead and has nothing he said let him go yeah brother brown said you can't you can you can do whatever you want to at the dead man they want you smack him kick him he don't care he just lays there see that's where we got to come to we this message is give us the opportunity to crucify the flesh to die to our own ways of thinking in our own ideas it's given it's given me the opportunity for richard douglas to die that god might live and what we don't realize is the opportunity he's given us he said he hath delivered me from the power of darkness in jehovah he just didn't deliver me from the power of darkness brothers and sisters but into his glorious life and i'm always telling him satan come on come on across the blood come on he can't do it if he did he'd be your brother he can't come into the light because when the lights flashed on him he's like a cockroach he scatters he's like oh my see we're supposed to be such a reflection of jesus christ when this light of god hits us we're supposed to reflect back jesus and when satan says that he's like my that ain't donny that's christ it's like putting a cross before a vampire if there was but there's a lot of spiritual vampires around the message trying to suck your faith out of you and suck your experience with christ out of you trying to get you to pull away pull away pull away people always saying it's so hard it's so hard i always like taking to the scripture he said my commandments are not grievous oh it ain't been the grievous walk for me it's been a joy has it been a hard walk oh yes it's been tough but you know what his grace has been sufficient for every mile [Applause] you know what we've talked about it we've listened to it we've believed it the prophet's talked about it and told us about but you know what i can see the finish line i can say satan if i have to crawl or roll across the line i'm coming you better get out of my way i'm determined with the opportunity god has given me paul said press toward the mark of the high calling he said you'll have to fight for everything you've got what a privilege it is to fight for truth what an honor it is to stand for the living god oh we could have quit we could walk away we could do all those things but what virtue does it have in it you know what satan would not be battling you if you was a loser like he tells you because satan you know nobody wants to be like a loser so why do you think satan wants to be like you because you're a winner and you have the power to create and he cannot stand it because creative power lives within us [Music] oh hallelujah ain't you thankful for the grace of god look at what the prophet of god said in the message experiences he said and he said brother branham she's only only one in the bunch that's a christian he said i guess that we're just too mean said that's the reason she's god's taking her from us because we're not christians and i've seen the opportunity that god had given me he said don't ever fail your opportunity he was like he was discouraged the man that god was taking away this sister and all this but he he said don't let me fail to tell you look that's not the end of the story that the grave is not the end of it that's not the end of the christian job had to go through all those things to see and know that my redeemer liveth he said don't fail your opportunities brothers and sisters let's not fail our opportunities we have people are wanting something real and i tell you jesus is the only real thing there is witnesses he said when god appears he usually appears in fire and they rush to the prophet to consume them hungry lines said they saw the fire around the prophet they stood there in the distance he said and then daniel in his trueness of witness of the living god gave testimony the next morning that there is a true and living god who can deliver from the lion's den he testified of it he gave him the opportunity he proved out a hundred percent he gave him the opportunity to glorify god i trusted him they didn't eat me there was a pillow to my head think about that they thought that that was going to be the end of daniel satan thought when all this happened that'll be the enterprise she'll quit she'll never come back i'll put fear on her she won't come back to church no more wrong wrong answer because we believe the scripture the bible says forsake not yourself descending yourselves together even more so as the days draw near we come together for what one reason to see jesus christ manifested through his word we have the opportunity to say we're not going to back down we're not going to bow look at the three hebrew children look at the opportunity they had there was hey there was that was not the only that was on not the only israelites in not the only israelites in babylon but that was the three that made the most of their opportunity huh when they blow their horn and sound the temples do all these things they wasn't bound to daniel when they say brother bram's god i'm not going to bow you say he's a prophet of god revealing god i said amen i'll bow to jesus christ and him alone i give my lies to christ and i've never changed my mind he had the opportunity to glorify god they said if you don't bow you're going in the fire he said whole king our god is more than able to deliver us from the fire but if he don't we still won't bow he's more than able to deliver us from any of our problems but if he don't i still will not bow to my circumstances i will not bow to my trial i will not back down from what god has given me i refuse to give up my rights i have the opportunity to stand in this age you have the opportunity to stand what a privilege it is to stand for a true and a living god what a gracious hour we live in will not bend will not bow will not burn and in they went but it didn't burn them and they didn't bow but it brung the voice of the sign they said behold i see a fourth man in the fire satan's seeing all this that he's doing to the bride and he's saying wow i threw him in but i see the fourth man and the fire they're not being consumed by this these circumstances do you know what brother brown said god gave you faith to master faith is a master of all your circumstances faith then god will master any situation in your life he said well brother you don't look like he's doing no better praise god i'm better i don't care what the devil says he don't tell he never told me the truth before you think he took true serum now the bible says he's a liar and the father of lies the truth's not in him are we going to believe his report or god's report are we going to be like oh are we going to be just say well i guess i ain't going to make it well you ain't if you don't think you're going you ain't going you know what i'm saying i said i'm going to make it in spite of myself because he started this he's going to finish it hallelujah he proved it to him that god that the god that daniel served and the god that shadrach meshach and sir was the true and living god he's the true god true god none like him even even even nebuchadnezzar said he serves as true in the living god we see the voice of the sign oh hallelujah have we not seen the voice of the sign the sign the voice is backed up what god has showed us in this day look in the message the unwelcome christ i'm fixing to close here it says pharisee simeon the pharisee was too busy cracking jokes with dr jones and all of them he didn't have time he let jesus slip and get in and that flunky let him slip by oh my i wish i could have took that flunky's place an opportunity to wash jesus's feet he said in and to anoint him and made him welcome he said that's the way it is he invited him and then he didn't make him welcome i'd hate to think we invited god into this service this morning and we didn't even make it well we didn't even make him welcome by the joy that we have for what he's done for us what an opportunity that he had he invited him i like what brother brandt said he said jesus always keeps all his appointments just invite him just invite him into your troubles invite him into your heartaches invite him into your situations he'll change it he'll change everything brother brown said he told brother bishop he said brother eddie every time he comes something good happens so i want him to come i want him to walk i'm not going to miss if he wants to move and i start crying i want to cry enough to wash his feet i don't want to care about what i look like to everybody else i don't care what nobody else thinks about me i just want to make his feet clean and if he wants me to anoint him with the joy of gladness i want to be the first one to give him my best i've never desired to be the best the best preacher i've always desired to be the best christian then the best preacher will come and he'll use whoever he please let's stand let's always never fail always remember never fail with the opportunity we have if you need healing the opportunity is here this morning if you need deliverance the opportunity is here it's not because i'm here or brother sam's here it's because jesus is here he give us the opportunity he said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden i'll give you rest what rest we have in this hour what a rest when the world's going crazy they went completely insane brother brown said they do just what they did he said the man without the holy spirit is nothing more but a brute beast look at the beastiality but you're still standing there smiling saying god i'm so thankful for what you've done for me they always tell me richard why are you so happy all the time i said i'm hooked up i'm plugged in i've got this direct line to jesus christ you know what when i get down on my knees and pray i don't have to talk to an answering machine i don't have to leave a message i got a direct line and he's always there and the bible said his ears are always open to our cries our problem is we don't cry enough he said he's only going to come to those who are crying come lord come lord jesus if this situation what's going on right now don't make you cry i don't know if you'll ever cry because this is the opportunity for us to call for the master when the storm the ship's shaking and all's going on just say jesus step on the bow i need you to say peace be still never head bow every eye closed who'll say lord don't let me miss no more opportunities lord let me be so tuned into your voice
