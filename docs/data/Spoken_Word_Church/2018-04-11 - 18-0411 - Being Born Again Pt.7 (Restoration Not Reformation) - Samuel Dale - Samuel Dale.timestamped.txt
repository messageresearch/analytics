[4:06] hour that we're living thank you for the
[4:09] love that you have bestowed upon us into
[4:12] our hearts that father that we love you
[4:14] no matter what comes or goes that love
[4:17] grows greater and greater because it is
[4:20] from a father who loves his children and
[4:24] he's trying to make manifest for upon
[4:26] earth that's what we're trying to do is
[4:28] talk about you Lord so you come on the
[4:30] scene and manifest yourself into each
[4:32] one of us and let your love and grace be
[4:36] with us and father forgive our sins
[4:38] because we want to stand completing you
[4:41] have your way as we read your words you

[4:45] us in Jesus name Amen
[4:49] we'll go to giant Peter then we'll go to
[5:00] well I got it down here
[5:05] firstly 123 okay 18 okay for as much as
[5:13] you know that you were not redeemed with
[5:15] corruptible things as silver and gold
[5:17] from your vain conversation received by
[5:20] tradition from your father's but with
[5:23] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[5:25] lamb without blemish and without spot
[5:28] Hoover Li was foreordained before the
[5:30] foundation of the world but was manifest
[5:33] in these last times for you who by him
[5:36] do believe in God
[5:37] that raised him from the dead and gave
[5:40] him glory that your faith and hope might
[5:43] be in God seeing you have purified your
[5:46] souls and obeying the truth through the
[5:49] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[5:52] Brethren see that you love one another
[5:54] with a pure heart fervently being born
[5:58] again not of corruptible seed but of
[6:01] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[6:05] liveth and abideth for ever now
[6:08] born-again by the Word of God all right
[6:12] you know what is the new birth the new
[6:15] birth is the birth of the word okay
[6:17] we're going now to Joel
[6:19] we'll go to 1 in verse 4 to get the
[6:23] foundational part that which the palmer
[6:26] worm has left at the locusts eaten and
[6:29] that was the locusts that left have to
[6:31] come cankerworm eaten and that which the
[6:34] cankerworm has left half the caterpillar
[6:37] eaten okay now we go over to our point
[6:41] of interest to verse 23 in the second
[6:44] chapter be glad then you children of
[6:47] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[6:50] for he had given you the former rain
[6:52] moderately now watch him he had given
[6:56] you the former rain moderately now we'll
[6:58] get to that in the message in a minute
[7:00] all right you got to get the former rain
[7:03] for you can have the latter rain all
[7:06] right that's plain since that's just
[7:08] something that ought to be understood
[7:10] and he will cause to come down for you
[7:13] the rain the former rain and the
[7:17] a terrain in the first month now that
[7:20] never happens unless there would be some
[7:23] situation in Israel you could go to a
[7:25] place and determine this can be done
[7:27] here
[7:27] this can be done it there it's in the
[7:29] gospel that you're talking about it's
[7:32] not in the natural rain it's only using
[7:35] that as an example to speak from all
[7:39] right now now will restore to you the
[7:43] years once now restore to you the years
[7:48] that the locust of the eaten the
[7:51] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[7:53] Palma worm my great army once I said
[7:56] among you you may be seated the Lord at
[7:59] his blessing to the reading of the word
[8:01] now remember as I said always when I
[8:04] read that scripture always reminds you
[8:07] that God's great army is not eating down
[8:12] but he permits it to happen right see
[8:18] when he says my great army that I sent
[8:19] among you he permits that to happen all
[8:23] right it's not that he does it or even
[8:25] causes it he permits it to come forth to
[8:28] her that you can have that point of
[8:32] understanding all right now I want you
[8:36] to think on this because I I try to redo
[8:40] and re listen to the services and this
[8:44] the pie service I preached on was I will
[8:48] restore all right now we went through a
[8:51] lot of things on that message of I will
[8:55] restore okay now we covered this point
[8:59] that I want to make sure that you follow
[9:01] to see there are some things that happen
[9:06] in this life days that was not here
[9:11] previously or in some other time
[9:14] it was spoke of give an example of or
[9:18] shown is to come forth but it's not in
[9:20] that point so then you're not dealing
[9:24] with restoration as we think of sure now
[9:29] you say well okay we
[9:30] we will come into world we sin we done
[9:32] we restored I that's fine no it's okay
[9:35] don't don't think I'm going all crazy in
[9:38] my thinking I'm just trying to get our
[9:41] thinking in the correct way of
[9:43] understanding of what it means
[9:46] restoration all right
[9:49] now I want you to think about
[9:52] restoration it's easy to use the terms
[10:00] as we think of and what does the word
[10:02] restore mean honor restoration
[10:07] restoration is not a biblical word is
[10:09] you know it's just restore all right it
[10:13] doesn't go to restoration you know what
[10:14] I mean all right now we know that it
[10:17] means to return back or to turn back or
[10:21] to return our to turn again or to come
[10:26] back in other words all right
[10:29] spiritually in speaking of it we know
[10:32] that the word restore means to something
[10:37] that was previously there something
[10:41] happens it's gone right and then it's
[10:45] restored brother Adam uses it like he'll
[10:48] drop something he says if I drop this
[10:51] and I pick up some other item he said
[10:55] that's not restoration he said
[10:58] restoration is to bring back what
[11:02] originally fell all right now get the
[11:05] point and then listen to what we're
[11:08] trying to get all right so restoration
[11:11] and I was trying to cover in that
[11:13] message we know that there's things like
[11:16] the seals is not a restoration because
[11:21] the seals were never preached they were
[11:23] preached by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24
[11:25] yeah okay but no man you know nobody
[11:28] didn't understand that it was a time for
[11:31] that it was not today for that it was to
[11:34] wait until the last angels message would
[11:38] come and then he would take up all the
[11:41] loose ends right
[11:44] and not only bring the loose ends of
[11:47] what was previously in the Bible taught
[11:51] by the Apostles and written all right he
[11:55] had to come and bring that before he
[11:58] could bring the other things sure he
[12:00] preached the seals he preached this he
[12:03] preached that he preached serpent seed
[12:05] in 58 right but then he would make a
[12:08] statement in his safe surface he was
[12:10] revealed in the seals well see
[12:13] everything was revealed in the seals
[12:15] when it comes to that amen everything is
[12:17] revealed in the seals all right but the
[12:20] seals were never taught by somebody and
[12:22] then had went away or taken away and
[12:26] then have to be restored all right the
[12:30] headstone was rejected by mankind all
[12:34] right even though the church received
[12:38] the new birth and the faith of the
[12:41] fathers still the head was rejected
[12:45] because he it no one could understand it
[12:49] so you don't deal with restoration all
[12:53] right now for heaven's sake don't think
[12:54] somebody when I'm in it I started
[12:56] dealing with the word Reformation don't
[12:58] think I'm trying to make something the
[13:00] Reformation more powerful that's crazy
[13:02] yeah
[13:03] I'll try to get to that in a minute but
[13:05] just for heaven's sake don't think that
[13:07] away all right listen
[13:09] because in the Bible way of using it the
[13:15] word restoration would be used when
[13:18] different numbers but have the meanings
[13:21] of it one of them is in the biggest
[13:24] portion of what's used of restore it
[13:26] means to return back or to come again or
[13:30] to be broke again all right now to
[13:33] restore means it was dire something
[13:36] happened and then it's got to be
[13:39] restored all right but don't deal with
[13:43] the things of something that's not in
[13:48] dealing with restoration you're going to
[13:50] miss the entire understanding of what is
[13:56] to be done
[13:58] so now we use restoration but now as I
[14:05] said you use restoration but what about
[14:09] this one
[14:10] now this is the word restore that is in
[14:15] jaw to where it says I will restore the
[14:22] years of the cankerworm locus the
[14:24] caterpillar now watch this point as we
[14:27] go along look at this definition I
[14:31] didn't give it to them so you know look
[14:36] at this definition it's a very hard word
[14:41] when it comes to this time it means to
[14:50] be in a covenant of peace now this is
[14:55] what joy means about restoration to be
[14:59] at peace peaceful 1:1 in covenant of
[15:08] peace
[15:13] and words to make peace with the comes
[15:17] to be at peace I'm reading this cause I
[15:21] want you to keep getting the peace the
[15:22] police the coven of the peace and then
[15:25] you'll see what joel is doing to make
[15:28] peace with the cause to be at peace to
[15:33] live in peace to be complete to be sound
[15:41] to be completely finished the ended to
[15:47] be sound be uninjured means to be
[15:52] complete is to finish it means to make
[15:56] safe it means to make whole or good or
[16:00] restore make compensation to make a good
[16:06] pay now this is the word restore from
[16:10] you
[16:11] to require recompense our reward to be
[16:16] performed to be repaid be required to
[16:21] complete to form to make an end of and
[16:25] what about when it could be summed up in
[16:29] a simple word of the other meanings of
[16:33] the word restore as to something to be
[16:36] returned the now you get into that and
[16:41] you find out there's something involved
[16:44] in jaw that we need to consider because
[16:50] it's not just dealing with a return it
[16:56] means to bring something to an end it
[17:01] means to bring it back to the original
[17:04] because if you don't bring it back to
[17:06] original you can't bring it to an end
[17:08] now listen to what I'm trying to get to
[17:10] and you'll study the message that's the
[17:14] way it'll help you listen to brother
[17:16] Branham brother Branham in his early
[17:19] ministry was talking about this
[17:21] messenger of Malachi 4 that it would
[17:24] come and restore all things then he'd
[17:29] bring forth the faith of the fathers all
[17:33] right you know how many times brother
[17:36] Branham uses the word faith of the
[17:37] father's we were discussing this in the
[17:39] Bible study the other night brother
[17:43] Branham uses the word faith of the
[17:45] fathers 57 times so it must be important
[17:52] he uses to turn the hearts of the
[17:55] children back to the faith of the
[17:58] fathers 66 times he uses to talk about
[18:06] the Pentecostal father's restore back to
[18:11] the Pentecostal father's 40 times now
[18:18] anybody that's ever been in the message
[18:19] very long and you've listened to any
[18:21] message I'd say you're gonna find a rare
[18:24] occasion I've never found one sermon yet
[18:27] that didn't have the word restore in one
[18:31] way or the other to that relation
[18:34] because that was what he was to do all
[18:37] right then we know that the seventh
[18:41] church aids Messenger was to come to
[18:45] restore the faith of the fathers all
[18:50] right now listen to restore the faith of
[18:54] the father's would mean to bring back
[18:57] the faith of the fathers you say what is
[18:59] the faith of the father's
[19:00] it's the revelation it's the doctrine
[19:02] it's the thoughts that they bring it's
[19:06] the word that they bring it's the faith
[19:08] of the fathers it doesn't necessarily
[19:10] deal with signs and wonders as we think
[19:14] about because be careful because
[19:17] anointed ones can get involved in signs
[19:20] and wonders right so if don't lay it all
[19:24] upon we know we've got the faith of the
[19:27] father's because we've got great signs
[19:29] and wonders see now you you surely know
[19:36] the anointed ones are now to faith in
[19:38] the father
[19:39] so deal with it in the correct way and
[19:42] you will see why did I've always
[19:44] emphasized what is the new birth it is
[19:47] the birth of the word the word made
[19:52] alive so the Prophet when he came we'll
[19:57] get down to it in a minute where he gets
[19:58] over to a message of just the end of the
[20:02] silence or something like that and he
[20:04] names the mysteries and he picked up
[20:07] Scott picks up from Scofield of the name
[20:10] in the mysteries and the things and he
[20:14] gives you a long list of mysteries you
[20:17] know what those mysteries were to be
[20:20] made known before the last message would
[20:27] come now are you listening see faith of
[20:32] the father has a wonderful positional
[20:35] placing but as I've always say it
[20:39] I've always touted this away I always
[20:42] believed it this away that if everybody
[20:45] in the world had the faith of the Father
[20:48] it'd be a wonderful world a great place
[20:52] but it would not be the change of the
[20:56] body it would not be to bring forth of
[21:00] great things it would not be the opening
[21:03] of the seals see because that's the
[21:10] catch that you got to get of this man
[21:12] that was doing brother Branham was what
[21:14] first to be to bring us back to the
[21:16] faith of the father's back to what was
[21:19] in the Bible that had been preached by
[21:22] mankind
[21:25] then as we'll get to the lights of the
[21:27] message I know we want tonight but then
[21:29] we'll get in to the point to where he
[21:32] says not in the years of preparation not
[21:37] in the divine healing campaign but said
[21:41] when he begins to bring his message then
[21:44] you're gonna see that it's a two-part
[21:46] thing brother Branham had to come to
[21:49] bring it into two sections two parts I
[21:51] don't know how to explain it I just know
[21:53] what it had to do he had to first return
[21:56] the faith of the fathers then the seals
[22:02] would break all right
[22:06] see how else can you explain because
[22:09] he's constantly talking about the faith
[22:14] of the fathers see brother Branham
[22:19] didn't have to come and preach one God
[22:21] the Apostles preached to him he didn't
[22:25] have to preach serpent seed the Apostles
[22:28] preached they're not in the form of what
[22:30] we may be get it and bring it down to as
[22:34] to try to go into the garden and the
[22:36] thing that was the Prophet taking that
[22:40] to show you what they were teaching huh
[22:45] and see all the things that we talked
[22:47] about a long time was the early ministry
[22:50] of the Prophet
[22:51] and him bringing forth the message he
[22:55] was praying it to preach the faith of
[22:57] the fathers and that's why when he gets
[22:59] to the statue of perfect man he said I
[23:01] just got this the other day on something
[23:04] that I was going to preach well he's
[23:10] seen the faith of the fathers as to what
[23:12] it was but you see the seals is not an
[23:18] addition it's not extra it's something
[23:22] that was there that was not made known
[23:25] to mankind you remember he had to whip
[23:28] the top off the in the dreamer you know
[23:31] every what it was and looked down in the
[23:34] seals was down in that pyramid it was
[23:39] never seen by mankind
[23:40] nobody ever preached those seals and
[23:43] things oh yeah we Baptists I'm not
[23:47] joking
[23:48] we Baptist we preached the sixth seal as
[23:51] a tribulation what because you can read
[23:56] it people have looked into things but
[24:03] they couldn't see what it was all about
[24:06] and see the Prophet had to come and
[24:09] first do a work of restoration back to
[24:16] the faith of the fathers because we had
[24:18] lost that so much in mankind until we
[24:20] come out of it with Martin Luther of the
[24:22] just shall live by faith
[24:24] wonderful great play and brother Adam
[24:27] said that was the start well yet he'll
[24:32] call him Reformation but he said that
[24:38] was where it started out because ours
[24:40] were you two little shoots raises up
[24:43] right showing that it's going to come
[24:47] forth but it's not there it's not dying
[24:51] as fullness as Doris speaking of it and
[24:56] see then to stay faith of the father's
[25:00] that is the Bible as far as mankind
[25:04] had wrote and been able to understand
[25:08] the ought you get me there's a quote
[25:10] there somewhere close to it and
[25:11] paraphrase it but he's talking about
[25:14] that the Bible as far as man knew had
[25:18] been made known you realized when he
[25:22] stood back there in 62
[25:24] [Music]
[25:26] is this the inside of the end he named
[25:29] the mysteries and he said this has been
[25:33] brought forth but he says now there's
[25:40] something else got to take place come on
[25:45] are we in the message do you need all
[25:48] these quotes where brother Brennan said
[25:50] Lord what am I going to do spoken word
[25:52] original seed he went through the Bible
[25:56] and showed that everything was dying the
[25:59] spoken word the regional seed but then
[26:01] when he gets over in the I believe it's
[26:03] the second message part of it but he
[26:05] says Lord what am I gonna do he said I
[26:10] got him out on the limb he said what am
[26:13] I gonna do the Lord said pick up your
[26:17] pen and write he started writing down
[26:21] and he wrote you'll read it he wrote
[26:23] exactly what he just preached the Lord
[26:26] confirming that to be what it was and
[26:28] then it stops he says but as of yet
[26:33] Malachi 4 is not fulfilled now come on
[26:39] if we're gonna quote the Prophet let's
[26:41] go with him he says as of yet well what
[26:47] did he what
[26:47] what would you do if you'd have been him
[26:50] I'd have started trying to find out what
[26:52] why yet it got involved you know hey we
[26:56] stopped I'm out on the limb
[26:59] what can I hop in' he knew what he had
[27:04] preached but he knew then that there was
[27:08] something he hadn't preached he preached
[27:13] on the seals but he knew there's
[27:14] something wrong with it right
[27:18] he preached a white horse rider yet he
[27:21] knew that something wrong and see read
[27:25] spoken words regional seed and listen it
[27:29] read it real careful and get especially
[27:33] to that where he says what am I gonna do
[27:36] Lord he said I gotta go out on the limb
[27:41] he said pick up your pen and ride he
[27:45] picked up his pen and he wrote with when
[27:49] he stopped at the end of it is he's
[27:50] probably trying to lay his pin down it
[27:53] struck him the Spirit of God spoke
[27:55] through the man and he wrote it down he
[27:57] says but as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[28:02] fulfilled all right see we thank Malachi
[28:07] for fulfilled in the fifties and sixties
[28:09] early or whatever
[28:10] no it wasn't fulfilled that was dealing
[28:13] with the faith of the fathers that was
[28:16] trying to get back to what has already
[28:17] been broke we had lost the understanding
[28:22] you understand what a mink oh that's the
[28:24] question earlier than that
[28:25] what is the faith of the fathers well
[28:27] you mean we've listened to the Word of
[28:29] God we have studied the Word of God and
[28:33] we've listened to the tapes and like I
[28:35] said 60 times 50 times that he speaks of
[28:39] the faith of the fathers and we'd asked
[28:42] what is the faith of the father
[28:44] it's the revelation they had that was
[28:49] already recorded in here when God was
[28:52] recorded by the Apostles and preached
[28:58] all the mysteries was there Paul would
[29:01] even speak of the chains of the body but
[29:05] he'd say there's something wrong I can't
[29:06] bring it I can't go any further he said
[29:11] I have to stay right here in other words
[29:12] read your Bible Paul knows he's bringing
[29:15] it up to a place but he knows he can't
[29:17] bring forth the fullness of it he could
[29:19] tell you about the change in a moment at
[29:21] Winkler and I because that's the spirit
[29:23] of prophecy the Word of God coming to
[29:25] the man's left but yet he couldn't tell
[29:29] what that was
[29:31] huh see because it was never put in the
[29:35] word brother branham is not I don't
[29:38] heaven help don't think that I'm saying
[29:40] brother branham headed to the word no
[29:42] way it was in the Word of God but not
[29:46] known by mankind of what it was Jesus
[29:49] preached those seals in Matthew 24 but
[29:52] nobody knew what he's talking about
[29:55] all right see because the point is if we
[30:00] don't get the face of the father's
[30:01] there's no need to talking about the
[30:03] seals other than listening to what is
[30:05] taught about them and trying to get an
[30:07] understanding of what we're doing to
[30:09] help us to come up the statue of a
[30:11] perfect man through the revealed word
[30:15] because like I said it don't you have a
[30:17] question when brother mo preached that I
[30:20] said well oh that's wonderful because
[30:22] we'd never heard anything or 71 running
[30:25] that point we'd never heard anything to
[30:27] that because we was under people saying
[30:29] well we don't know about this adoption
[30:31] is is a simple matter but statue a
[30:34] perfect man is a deep matter now we
[30:36] don't understand this we don't
[30:37] understand that it's you know what I
[30:41] said how do we go is this some secret
[30:51] code written somewhere in the message
[30:54] you remember when they found out how
[30:56] many tapes was drug a few years ago 14
[30:59] or 24 or something like it they found of
[31:01] the messages and you know I'm sorry I'm
[31:05] human I'm sorry well look at that I've
[31:08] seen people just running I gotta get to
[31:10] him I got to get to him cause there's
[31:12] something in there it's been kept a
[31:14] secret until now
[31:15] well they got him it didn't do any good
[31:19] because he didn't know what to look for
[31:23] like wait is trying his best to bring
[31:25] out because you know I follow it because
[31:28] see that's what God revealed to me back
[31:31] gonna those seals is not Antichrist plot
[31:39] horse read Horner that's exactly what's
[31:42] going on out here the seals is a rebel a
[31:44] oh Jesus Christ
[31:50] didn't we find out by going over and
[31:52] over and over from Chrysler mister God
[31:54] revealed what is the new birth brother
[31:55] around them it's a revelation of Jesus
[31:56] Christ
[31:58] so when he comes over to the Seventh
[32:00] Seal and gets into the back of limits
[32:02] right it's either the sixth or the
[32:03] seventh he gets into the back of the
[32:04] message and he says now when this comes
[32:09] up he said gone so don't try to figure
[32:12] it out because you work your way away
[32:14] from it said go on with a same simple
[32:17] message it'll be made known to you when
[32:20] it's necessary is that yet par phrase in
[32:23] the quote close he said he even said it
[32:29] now like what he was bringing after
[32:31] Sunday you know you're preaching to
[32:32] people that was setting off when it was
[32:34] freeze but what did brother I'm sorry
[32:36] he said it's gone from you and he said
[32:39] there's no way for you to get it but
[32:41] said right around the coming of the Lord
[32:45] you said I got it I heard this I heard
[32:48] that amen I just have to say what he
[32:52] said he said he didn't get it
[32:54] well look God well okay I have no
[32:58] arguments with you it doesn't bother me
[33:01] for somebody to differ with me it
[33:06] bothers me when we won't listen to the
[33:09] word and try to follow the lineup of the
[33:13] word this prophet when he come in the
[33:16] last days when he come out there in 33
[33:20] and all of that coming up he was a
[33:22] prophet amen
[33:24] but he groped in grace and knowledge
[33:27] through the opening of the word until he
[33:31] reached the faith of the fathers that's
[33:33] why I Illustrated it he said on statue
[33:36] of a perfect man he said these disciples
[33:38] apostle there was word and he was you he
[33:40] said they had these virtues he said they
[33:42] had these qualification he said they had
[33:44] the least little nod from God right the
[33:47] same message he starts explaining and he
[33:51] says there I was waiting he said I was
[33:55] waiting on him and he said then I got a
[33:57] nod from him
[33:58] and then I went prayed for the child or
[34:00] the woman or whatever it was showing us
[34:03] he was right to that position then he
[34:07] was right there at the faith of the
[34:09] Father that's what I tried to tell you
[34:10] you got Peter preaching the way to come
[34:15] to the statue of a perfect man right
[34:17] faith works our knowledge temperance
[34:19] placing huh
[34:20] and here comes Paul he don't listen to
[34:22] Peter he goes off to his self he leaves
[34:28] and goes to his self and he said no man
[34:30] taught me these times he said the Holy
[34:32] Ghost told me well when he came out what
[34:35] was he teaching adoption well what was
[34:39] he teaching adoption statue of a
[34:41] perfectly human Peter was saying
[34:44] identically the same thing right
[34:50] why cause Paul was a prophet the word
[34:54] could come to him and it came to him out
[34:57] on the backside he didn't have to listen
[34:59] to the rest of them showing you what God
[35:01] can do
[35:02] showing you do you realize if that
[35:03] wasn't our as an example of Peter saying
[35:07] this and Paul coming with this and them
[35:09] saying the same thing I'd have a hard
[35:11] time listening to brother Branham
[35:12] because of the way he talks because I
[35:15] would say how did you get it he wasn't
[35:21] that guard to listen to nobody else
[35:22] teach it right is that sensible he
[35:29] wasn't back tyre he never he got it from
[35:33] studying the Word of God until he got
[35:36] the same revelation Peter had he got the
[35:39] same revelation Paul had why cuz he got
[35:42] it from what they wrote and there he
[35:47] stands with that stature of a perfect
[35:49] man made within him he says but still I
[35:54] got a problem Lord then he says but as
[36:01] of yet Malachi 4 was not fulfilled
[36:04] well what did he set out to do I
[36:08] remember talking to a certain brother
[36:10] about
[36:11] I heard him I heard him make the
[36:12] statements before you've heard him to
[36:14] that he said brother branham said are
[36:17] you Malachi 4 he said yes he said would
[36:19] tell everybody he said you can't do it
[36:20] now that's what the man said you know
[36:24] I'm just quoting what somebody said okay
[36:26] in other words why don't you go out and
[36:28] tell everybody you're Malachi for the
[36:31] Lord Jesus never told everybody he was
[36:33] gone he just performed the works of God
[36:37] and you know what the genuine saw he was
[36:40] God the riffs are man he's not that the
[36:44] same thing that happened in the prophets
[36:45] ministry most people saw a man but some
[36:52] saw God in a man to bring the message to
[36:57] were that we could have the Word of God
[37:02] revealed unto us to be able to be
[37:08] restored back to the faith of the Father
[37:13] you don't hear anything about that
[37:16] people are not wanting to be restored
[37:18] back to the face of the slaughter they
[37:19] just want to know what the seals are in
[37:21] a message if you preach it to her in
[37:23] about 30 minutes I remember brother
[37:27] Moulton preaching on probably one statue
[37:29] a perfect manner matter of fact I think
[37:30] it was and this brother said something
[37:33] about it and he said that likes I'd like
[37:35] to study the Hat and you know get a
[37:37] better understanding said you could you
[37:38] you sent him in enticed he said yeah a
[37:40] sixty something of them and you called
[37:46] me slow and he said there was 60
[37:49] something hug him brother said I ain't
[37:52] got time to listen all in this is what
[37:56] the words come back to him said you
[37:59] goofed off all these years and don't
[38:00] know nothing now something paraphrasing
[38:07] cuz he told him the truth they were I
[38:11] ain't got time to listen 60 something
[38:13] messages you had 50 years that ain't
[38:17] time enough to listen to 50 60 messages
[38:25] what do you been listening to my brother
[38:30] Luis was on the there the other wind
[38:32] Steve what have we been listening to you
[38:35] I don't have any trouble with anybody as
[38:38] long as I know they at least know what
[38:41] the Prophet says then you can deal with
[38:46] that but then when I said oh no no no
[38:48] you rock that right there within all I
[38:52] want to know what is right if the
[38:58] disciples didn't have the virtues as the
[39:00] Prophet said how in the world are we
[39:02] going to be able to get it if the
[39:05] Prophet didn't have it if the disciple
[39:07] didn't have time to work at you and I
[39:09] get it and I wasn't the one that wrote
[39:11] the book if you've listened to the
[39:14] stature of a perfect man you've heard
[39:15] brother Branham say that seven ages
[39:18] brains the church to a place he said in
[39:21] a seven virtues that will bring this
[39:24] people to a rapture oh you mean we've
[39:31] got to have these virtues it's not that
[39:38] we need them it's that we've got to have
[39:42] them somebody has all right see now
[39:49] getting to the point that we say I will
[39:53] restore all right let's deal with what
[40:00] was there and see that the will get to
[40:03] the restoration of the bride treif not
[40:05] if you'll listen to that message you'll
[40:06] hear this over and over for messengers
[40:10] of death took the tree down for
[40:12] messengers of life restores the tree if
[40:15] you listen to the restoration of the rod
[40:17] tree and I'd ask you if anybody has an
[40:19] extra copy of that for some reason I
[40:22] have misplaced mine of the restoration
[40:25] the bride Trina somebody has an extra
[40:27] copy of the restoration abroad tree I'd
[40:29] like to have one alright because i like
[40:31] to keep my books and and studying okay
[40:33] now then according to rest
[40:36] to the broad tree the same bug just
[40:40] changes stages you see the same thing
[40:43] wait talking about white horse riding a
[40:44] red horse rider like Walker I was
[40:47] sitting there the other day you don't
[40:48] never think and and listen I sitting
[40:51] every one way was talking the other day
[40:52] and you know he said to me he made the
[40:55] statement he said that went on is that
[40:58] white righteous church you remember you
[41:04] realize that church kept well going you
[41:06] realize the deception was in that early
[41:09] church just kept right on going but the
[41:13] rider got off and got onto the red
[41:15] worker kill do you realize that most of
[41:18] the people most of the people in no way
[41:22] ever had anything to do with the killing
[41:25] of the Christians you don't think they
[41:31] were good people in that white righteous
[41:34] church and they had nothing to do with
[41:37] killing the early Christians but it was
[41:40] the groups the leaders the ones that
[41:45] when it changed from a doctrine over and
[41:48] become killing most of the people were
[41:53] not involved with that killing they were
[41:58] trying to help them don't change me
[42:02] that's all that was criminal something
[42:04] goes wrong knowledge no it didn't
[42:06] those people went right on trying to
[42:09] serve Jesus Christ and God looked down
[42:12] in a lot of it and winked at the
[42:13] ignorance and and let it go but then
[42:17] they started killing the red horse then
[42:22] it changed to the black horse ain't
[42:24] changed to the pale horse it was the
[42:26] horse it changed the rider was the same
[42:29] it was just the situation's but I was
[42:32] just sitting there thinking Lord don't
[42:34] people realize that that church when it
[42:36] went out when that devil tried to get
[42:39] into that early church it didn't get
[42:43] into everybody they was good people
[42:49] there was good Christian people out
[42:51] there but then the enemy started taking
[42:58] over okay but listen why don't you
[43:01] listen sometimes and think about what it
[43:03] is so you just think get off the white
[43:06] horse we start killing everybody no
[43:09] that's just like today there's people
[43:12] that love you that would give their life
[43:15] for you and yet they don't believe what
[43:18] you believe they believe enough in God
[43:23] right to be able to be good people I
[43:28] don't look at the world out there
[43:30] Oh everybody's the devil everybody said
[43:32] watch that group I said yeah well I said
[43:34] devil everybody's out there Devils no I
[43:38] look at these people sitting right over
[43:40] here that's just what they can be they
[43:43] have the opportunity to be foolish
[43:45] virgins and you know what the only
[43:50] difference between them and us is the
[43:52] new birth in the soul the rest of it is
[43:56] a religious people that are a lot of
[43:59] times more sincere than we are more
[44:05] honorable and respectable than we are
[44:07] well yet we're bride
[44:09] we ain't them oh maybe they got
[44:13] something we ain't got come on my
[44:18] daughter think okay get off of it
[44:22] but listen you realize what I'm saying
[44:28] there was things that the Prophet tells
[44:32] you that we're never back there and it
[44:35] was not restoration because they wasn't
[44:40] back there as brought out into the world
[44:45] then it would come to his day and he
[44:48] would have the message and listen I know
[44:51] the quotes listen he said this messenger
[44:54] he said he has no special there's one
[44:56] quote wrong no special means he said
[44:59] he's just to straighten up all them
[45:00] others be careful
[45:03] if you don't have one thing correct
[45:06] you're gonna make him a reformer you're
[45:16] in bad shape I won't get tired at night
[45:19] I know it Kota I've been laying this
[45:21] down for weeks to get it right let's
[45:25] don't make brother branham a reformer
[45:26] but you know Martin Luther was a
[45:29] reformer but yet he started the church
[45:32] back on the day when it was posted and
[45:36] without him started it wouldn't be here
[45:38] now but Martin Luther was not bringing
[45:41] restoration he was trying to get the
[45:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost by the baptism
[45:48] the Holy Ghost was already there the
[45:50] Holy Ghost had never you ain't getting
[45:51] the point that the Prophet makes out of
[45:53] it it's the Holy Ghost in every age
[45:56] there's never been a age without the
[45:59] baptism when the Holy Ghost come on sure
[46:02] at least be sensible there's no age
[46:05] without the baptism because that's like
[46:07] I said no the other day if you don't
[46:09] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[46:11] have raised to quicken the word that age
[46:12] is going to have to go to the White
[46:14] Throne but even Martin Luther because
[46:19] you've got to remember you're dealing
[46:21] with an individual and what he's
[46:23] bringing compared to an age Luther's
[46:30] AIDS was an unfulfilled age right is
[46:34] that out of the church borders but
[46:37] Luther wasn't unfulfilled
[46:39] Luther was the bride across that day the
[46:43] church that's why we need to listen to
[46:47] find out what's going on the baptism of
[46:50] the Holy Ghost was not to be restored to
[46:53] restore it back like the day of
[46:55] Pentecost with the Apostles yes but not
[46:59] to restore the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:01] as a new birth it was in every church
[47:03] age so you're not dealing with
[47:07] restoration we were talking about the
[47:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:15] come on get it in the right order the
[47:21] faith of the fathers is what's got to be
[47:23] restored the revelation the doctrine the
[47:29] teaching of the fathers he's got to be
[47:33] restored right now what are we getting
[47:41] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[47:49] never eaten away it was the word that
[47:52] was eaten away come on we don't have
[47:58] time to get to it but remember what it
[47:59] was
[48:00] can't conform to local scatter pillar
[48:01] what was it one eight fruit one eight
[48:08] two leaves one eight to bark and one
[48:12] eight to life it went into the roots and
[48:16] had to start back over and Luther
[48:18] started back in the right way to bring
[48:20] back but he didn't bring the life in the
[48:24] natural type of way he was bringing it
[48:26] he had to lie for his time you see all
[48:32] I'm trying to do is get you to think
[48:34] think about as I said brother Brennan
[48:37] said if you don't know what the Holy
[48:39] Ghost is how do you know whether you got
[48:40] it or not
[48:41] I know I got it cuz I spoke in tongues
[48:45] well praise God what the devil is in all
[48:54] of that you got to get to the one thing
[48:56] the devil can't get in to enable one
[48:59] thing he can't get in to that is the
[49:02] revealed word now he can get into the
[49:04] letter and try to con you know bring all
[49:07] kind of things but just quote the word
[49:13] you're talking to somebody just keep
[49:17] saying that word you watch them in a
[49:19] minute and they'll start backing away
[49:24] carrying away cuz it nobody can't do
[49:28] think what you're doing you just keep
[49:31] saying that bringing that word and
[49:33] you'll see it come to an end
[49:34] all right now listen the Holy Ghost was
[49:40] in every Church age in every church age
[49:45] was the life of Jesus Christ
[49:48] every church age was the age of the
[49:51] born-again believer ever church age you
[49:55] know the age of the people the bride was
[49:58] never in the age you've got seven ages
[50:03] with the bride was never in there she
[50:05] was never in the age she was called out
[50:07] of the age when you're called out of the
[50:09] age you're called into baptism of the
[50:11] Holy Ghost that brings you out of the
[50:12] age physically we're still here
[50:14] physically we're here in lady o sail
[50:17] right but spiritually you're not
[50:20] supposed to be in lady ousia
[50:22] Martin Luther was the message of the
[50:25] judge shall live by faith and glory
[50:27] hallelujah where would we be if he
[50:29] hadn't started with him so don't
[50:32] misunderstand now as we go along and
[50:35] talk about him as a reformer and try to
[50:37] making something that brother branham
[50:38] doesn't make him you say what's this got
[50:45] to do with the statue of perfect man I
[50:47] thought you said he's gonna get there I
[50:48] hadn't got there far enough yet because
[50:51] we're just kneeling now what took away
[50:54] what was took away from the early church
[50:59] not the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was
[51:02] there the Word was eating away right
[51:09] the word was what was eating away now
[51:14] you can go into your church agency and
[51:15] lie still about the Third Age weights
[51:18] covering that part so it's real good
[51:20] working in with we haven't planned these
[51:22] things it's just his way and my way but
[51:27] you come up to do those ages and read
[51:30] around and said there was none greater
[51:31] than Martin look at him where he's at
[51:35] Martin comes up to the 3rd Turk Church
[51:37] and he said there's nothing greater than
[51:39] the Lord Jesus was the only man greater
[51:41] to
[51:41] Martin he said they was miracles and
[51:43] ever service the great things happened
[51:48] Columbo or how you pronounce it Columbo
[51:52] Columbo he was the fourth one you see it
[51:57] then as it begins to just deteriorate
[52:00] more and more you realize what I'm
[52:03] talking about
[52:05] Church think with me please
[52:08] here's the faith of the father's the
[52:13] understanding of the faith of the
[52:15] father's they had these virtues but they
[52:19] had this in the aides part and as it did
[52:22] these things would be added as needed
[52:24] and they were teaching us how to come to
[52:27] where they were - were your keys that
[52:34] somebody's got to teach us but we don't
[52:38] got the prophets message praise God but
[52:41] we've been here 50 years blabbering
[52:43] about it sorry I'm saying this 50 years
[52:50] ago - maybe not as strong I'm sorry I
[52:54] know I sound like I'm as hateful as all
[52:56] get-out without swap places will you and
[52:58] let you see what Christ saying to you to
[53:00] come and bring to the church if I hurt
[53:03] your feelings I'm sorry
[53:06] but if I save your soul we ain't gonna
[53:09] be worried about your little feelings if
[53:13] the truth is what'll set us free then we
[53:15] need the truth well I just listen for
[53:19] myself
[53:20] go ahead according to the Bible you
[53:21] can't do it now according to the faith
[53:26] of the fathers I said I'd get around to
[53:32] preaching that one these day gotta
[53:33] remember nine spiritual gifts right
[53:39] that's gifts but you're gonna find out
[53:43] one of these days that the fivefold
[53:45] ministry is more than gifts come on I
[53:54] got the notes I don't worry about it
[53:56] I fold ministry comes predestinated
[54:00] eternally from God you know the argument
[54:06] is whether or not I'm called that's your
[54:09] business right that's your choice the
[54:14] argument is not according to the word
[54:16] the argument is according to whether I'm
[54:19] part of it well I'm not the one that got
[54:27] in the statue of perfect man who says
[54:28] Lord fill me up with these times thanks
[54:32] Berkshire knowledge temperance patience
[54:33] godless brother because he said that I
[54:35] may teach others apostles prophets
[54:38] evangelists pastors he to bring these
[54:40] things into the church did you read that
[54:47] did you read that in the statute program
[54:49] or did you sleep through I used to get
[54:52] so tickled that brother would be he he
[54:54] said I'm sitting there on the porch
[54:55] listening to tapes and he said I said
[54:58] sometimes I sleep sometimes I listen no
[55:01] that's not the way we do but listen
[55:05] church why would the Bible
[55:16] the profit and the natural router called
[55:22] Martin Luther a reformer while we call
[55:31] him a reformer
[55:41] what is the word reform name what about
[55:48] it
[55:53] the word reform means the improvement
[55:57] are admit admit meant am en da NT
[56:03] amendment of what is wrong or to
[56:10] correction it's something that's
[56:15] unsatisfactory because it's not
[56:18] fulfilling it's trying to change from
[56:23] that state to a better state or form I'm
[56:27] giving you a Webster's definition of a
[56:29] reform why would it call Martin Luther a
[56:38] reformer
[56:44] what's the key that would give us great
[56:47] understanding cuz I surely hope I don't
[56:51] have to keep preaching over and over
[56:52] because I preach to you just what I've
[56:54] always believed when brother Branham
[56:56] come into this world he was born the
[56:59] Prophet but he didn't have everything he
[57:02] didn't understand everything you
[57:05] understood a whole lot more than we
[57:06] understand oh yeah
[57:08] oh no problem but he growed in grace and
[57:11] knowledge all right and then growing in
[57:16] grace and knowledge as I said he come up
[57:18] through the statue of a perfect man then
[57:21] he says but Lord broken words reading
[57:24] see I've got him out on the limb now
[57:26] what will I do then the Lord says as of
[57:28] yet Malachi 4 was not fulfilled brother
[57:36] Browns message didn't begin in the seals
[57:37] I mean didn't begin in 30 threes or
[57:41] anywhere you want to hear his message
[57:43] begin right along in the opening of the
[57:44] sealed I wouldn't want to say that he
[57:46] did I'll give you those quotes there you
[57:48] think got two notes you got him in front
[57:50] of you you know the Prophet said not in
[57:52] a year of preparation he said when he
[57:55] begins to sign it
[57:56] brother Browns message begin to be
[57:59] sounded starting there in the 62 and
[58:02] coming on over 63 64 65 cause it lice
[58:05] about three and a half year
[58:07] and he brought the secret things to us
[58:11] but at that stage he had already taught
[58:14] a statue of a perfect man he had already
[58:18] taught adoption mm-hmm but what about it
[58:28] go ahead and our brothers and let's put
[58:30] up a few things and get started like we
[58:37] get this a little bit and then we'll
[58:38] quit look at number 1 which is paragraph
[58:47] 257 and 258 there's Summerlin church h
[58:53] rd c and george a you got what they call
[58:56] now what be watchful and strengthen the
[59:01] things which remain that are ready for
[59:03] to die for I have not found thy works
[59:05] perfect before God
[59:08] now that's to the age that's not be to
[59:12] just the unbelievers that's to the age
[59:18] okay now listen I wish it could be said
[59:22] the sardian age was a restoration
[59:26] instead of a reformation I cannot say
[59:30] that the word does not call it a
[59:33] restoration but certainly calls it a
[59:37] Reformation were sat out in the word I
[59:39] don't know go ask him he's one just said
[59:42] it you want to argue with him go ahead
[59:44] he said it was in the word he says the
[59:52] word said fifteen hundred years ago
[59:54] Martin Luther was coming where's that in
[59:58] the Bible it's in the message you ain't
[1:00:03] listening to what I said while ago he
[1:00:06] come to bring the things that were
[1:00:08] sealed up of mankind that we couldn't
[1:00:12] understand listen he called it a
[1:00:17] Reformation don't matter Luther's age
[1:00:20] now what
[1:00:20] had it been a restoration that will age
[1:00:24] would have been another Pentecostal age
[1:00:28] but it was not the best that could be
[1:00:32] said of it was strengthen that which
[1:00:35] remains that is ready to die there was
[1:00:39] something missing my yes there certainly
[1:00:45] was this age had justification known
[1:00:50] read him we did that miss sanctification
[1:00:54] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:00:57] age had justification Martin Luther had
[1:01:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for that
[1:01:10] age
[1:01:10] but the age itself will read it the
[1:01:13] minute was unfulfilled right watch the
[1:01:19] age and watch the individual that is
[1:01:22] what God's original plan was that is
[1:01:27] what they had at Pentecost they were
[1:01:29] justified they were sanctified they were
[1:01:31] filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to
[1:01:33] me
[1:01:34] the reason for being justified and
[1:01:35] sanctified is to the end that you might
[1:01:37] be baptized with the holy God all right
[1:01:39] that's the reason there is a church it's
[1:01:42] the temple of God filled with God even
[1:01:44] the Holy Ghost coming home down the
[1:01:45] listen this age did not have those works
[1:01:49] the Pentecost show that they did the
[1:01:52] works that he did he didn't have it
[1:01:54] Martin Luther's they didn't have the
[1:01:56] works coming out there like it did on
[1:01:57] the original deaf penny column this age
[1:01:59] did not have those works oh they had the
[1:02:02] written word but not the revealed word
[1:02:06] it reads your prophet this was the
[1:02:09] Reformation period but fear not little
[1:02:14] flaw
[1:02:15] God said I will restore and this reform
[1:02:19] was going to be the start of it Luther
[1:02:27] was the start of restoration but it
[1:02:29] couldn't be restoration he's explaining
[1:02:32] to you why he
[1:02:34] was giving to according to his promise
[1:02:36] he was going to according to his promise
[1:02:39] take the church back from the depth of
[1:02:41] Satan in the Dark Age to the depth of
[1:02:43] God that they had at Pentecost in the
[1:02:45] first few years of the existence of the
[1:02:47] church that was what he wanted but they
[1:02:51] never got it in that age listen to what
[1:02:54] he goes on to say I have not found that
[1:03:01] works perfect before God do you know
[1:03:04] what the meaning of not perfect really
[1:03:07] is it is unfulfilled this age was an
[1:03:12] unfulfilled age it was just the start of
[1:03:16] getting back never lose those thoughts
[1:03:21] Martin Luther was the start of it coming
[1:03:25] back right don't throw him away it was
[1:03:31] just the start of getting back that's
[1:03:33] why I said the Bible called it
[1:03:35] Reformation not restoration the Bible
[1:03:40] called Luther Reformation he got a
[1:03:44] Scofield Bible go in there and find that
[1:03:48] and you'll find the Scofield saying
[1:03:52] Luther was a reformer because that's
[1:03:56] what the world taught him as being
[1:03:57] because he never brought forth another
[1:04:00] day of Pentecost he brought trying to
[1:04:03] reform the church Martin Luther never
[1:04:06] started with the idea of getting out of
[1:04:10] the church
[1:04:11] he started with and tried to the end to
[1:04:15] reform the church from the ways that had
[1:04:18] went away from he never wanted to leave
[1:04:22] the church he wanted to straighten the
[1:04:27] church out right but it didn't work so
[1:04:33] they told him out what that's why I said
[1:04:38] the Bible called it Reformation not
[1:04:40] restoration and it started out in the
[1:04:43] doctrine of justification which meant
[1:04:45] salvation was of God and how Luther pre
[1:04:48] the sovereignty of God an election he
[1:04:51] knew it was all of grace he separated
[1:04:53] the church from rule by ecclesiastical
[1:04:57] hierarchy he tore down the idols now
[1:04:59] like he done pretty good he kept out the
[1:05:01] confessions to the priests he denounced
[1:05:03] the Pope it was wonderfully good as he
[1:05:06] started but God had said 1,500 years
[1:05:10] before Luther you are going to start
[1:05:15] things but your age will see it all
[1:05:21] unfulfilled and what about the great man
[1:05:26] that we talked about of the message
[1:05:28] equated number three a resume of the
[1:05:31] church failure we rejoice in this age
[1:05:35] for this one thing Reformation had
[1:05:39] started he's happy for Reformation
[1:05:46] what's it it was not a resurrection
[1:05:54] Martin Luther but a Reformation neither
[1:06:00] was it a restoration but the corn of
[1:06:06] wheat that had died at Nicaea and then
[1:06:09] dried it in the dark ages now sent up a
[1:06:11] shoot of true signifying that some
[1:06:14] future day at some future date at the
[1:06:17] end of the lady of center at least an
[1:06:20] age just before Jesus came the church
[1:06:23] would go back to being a wheat seed
[1:06:25] bride again while the tires would be
[1:06:28] harvested and burnt in the lake of fire
[1:06:30] Luther come up with two little shoots
[1:06:35] that was not looking like the original
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:40] the original was the corner wheat full
[1:06:44] corn ready to plant dried everything
[1:06:45] else that's what's died and went into
[1:06:48] the ground the full word went into the
[1:06:52] ground and I see you I know I've tried
[1:06:56] my best to preach it until even
[1:06:57] ministers different with me on the basis
[1:07:00] and they said
[1:07:01] the bride never went to Nicaea I didn't
[1:07:04] say it brother branham said he did so
[1:07:07] I'm gonna stay with what he said he said
[1:07:10] they went to Nicaea right see we can get
[1:07:16] our little philosophies well that don't
[1:07:18] look right see this is a better way of
[1:07:21] understanding all right but it ain't the
[1:07:23] word I'm sorry then when that happens to
[1:07:27] me I said okay show me into word that's
[1:07:33] all I said just show me the word Martin
[1:07:36] Luther's age was a wonderful age I would
[1:07:38] love to live back there because to just
[1:07:42] be a Christian you'd lose your life they
[1:07:46] put their lives on the line they were
[1:07:48] coming out at the end of that are in
[1:07:50] that Reformation was coming into that
[1:07:52] thousand years that the church was
[1:07:55] ruling and Martin Luther was not the
[1:07:57] first one to protest the Catholic Church
[1:07:59] know there was plenty of them you got
[1:08:03] Whitfield and Knox and Calvin and in all
[1:08:07] kind of different ones you got all of
[1:08:12] them
[1:08:14] that was back there that's where you got
[1:08:17] it I read that while ago it was the age
[1:08:18] of the written word the written word
[1:08:21] would come back into being that you
[1:08:23] could study the Bible and they started
[1:08:27] writing their own doing then you got the
[1:08:29] Whitfield's you got the different ones
[1:08:30] that wrote their own Bibles it was a
[1:08:36] wonderful age in time yet it was not
[1:08:40] back to the original so it would be
[1:08:44] called Reformation okay not restoration
[1:08:50] and wouldn't he be called resurrection
[1:09:00] go ahead to the next one
[1:09:03] 372 77 scuse me still in there is only
[1:09:08] age this age started after out this age
[1:09:11] started after the turn of the 20th
[1:09:13] century
[1:09:14] and it was to be the age in which the
[1:09:16] true church now listen to he talking
[1:09:17] about I didn't Luther him look who he's
[1:09:19] talking about age it was to be the age
[1:09:22] in which the true Church would return to
[1:09:24] being the bride Azusa Street started it
[1:09:28] come on forget that well get on down
[1:09:30] here just hold it all together and watch
[1:09:32] him in which the true church would
[1:09:35] return to being the bride she was at
[1:09:37] Pentecost now that's a promise I love it
[1:09:39] we know that there must of necessity be
[1:09:41] a return of dynamic power the believer
[1:09:45] since this in their spirits and begin
[1:09:47] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[1:09:50] as was in the first century what seemed
[1:09:52] to be the answer came as many began to
[1:09:54] speak in tongues and manifest gifts of
[1:09:57] the Spirit
[1:09:58] it was then believed that this was
[1:10:01] indeed the long-awaited restoration it
[1:10:06] was not the wooden restoration Juicer
[1:10:10] Street was a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:12] coming back as the people to match the
[1:10:15] book of Acts come on the match the book
[1:10:21] the book of Acts with the three thousand
[1:10:23] outside and the babies who had to be
[1:10:25] taught the sincere milk of the word that
[1:10:27] you may grow barber there by Paul having
[1:10:30] trouble with the Corinthians that's why
[1:10:31] though the word Corinthians he wrote two
[1:10:33] books to them Corinthians is what the
[1:10:36] book of Corrections
[1:10:37] he was always correcting them why cuz
[1:10:41] there were babies they had no trouble
[1:10:45] with Ephesians my other being but twelve
[1:10:48] but they were straight he said brother
[1:10:51] Brent said the Ephesians had to give but
[1:10:53] he said Paul didn't have to put him in
[1:10:54] order another words paraphrasing but
[1:10:58] listen it was believed that this was
[1:11:00] indeed the long-awaited restoration it
[1:11:02] was not for the latter rain can come
[1:11:05] only after the former rain which is the
[1:11:08] British spring our teaching rain the
[1:11:12] latter rain then is the harvest rain how
[1:11:15] could this be the real thing when the
[1:11:18] teaching rain had not come now listen
[1:11:20] the Prophet messenger who was to be sent
[1:11:23] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[1:11:26] of the children back to the
[1:11:27] coastal fathers had not yet come
[1:11:33] that's what was thought to be the
[1:11:35] restoration and the final quickening
[1:11:37] unto the rapture had not come
[1:11:40] it was mixture of the unrighteous per
[1:11:44] taking our spiritual blessings and
[1:11:46] manifesting in the Holy Ghost the
[1:11:49] anointed ones right as we have kept
[1:11:51] pointing out to you it is also was devil
[1:11:54] power as men were under the control of
[1:11:57] the devils of devils yet no one seemed
[1:12:00] to realize it than to prove that it was
[1:12:05] not the real these people even before a
[1:12:09] second generation that appeared
[1:12:11] organized and wrote their own scriptural
[1:12:15] doctrines and built their own fences as
[1:12:18] ever other group ahead of them did now
[1:12:24] when we give the definition just in a
[1:12:25] second of a Reformation you're gonna see
[1:12:27] what it is
[1:12:28] Reformation is trying to reform the
[1:12:30] previous age and see that's what that
[1:12:35] was exactly trying to do instead of that
[1:12:38] they wound up and organize themselves
[1:12:39] that's what Susur Street just remember
[1:12:44] now the bride was in done okay but it
[1:12:50] wouldn't bring it forth in the right way
[1:12:52] okay go ahead to number five this is the
[1:12:56] first seal now look what he says
[1:13:01] Reformers came to reform the lifes
[1:13:03] fallen church age preceding them okay
[1:13:07] and then after the Reformers come and
[1:13:10] reform the church age from where it was
[1:13:13] and this went back into the world then
[1:13:18] they start a new church age always done
[1:13:21] it always now we went through that in
[1:13:24] other words it been a Catholic Church
[1:13:29] age of the Roman Catholic Church
[1:13:33] Along Came Luther a reformer and watch
[1:13:38] him he's
[1:13:39] a reformer and what does he do he starts
[1:13:42] out dire a hammering away and when he
[1:13:45] does he protests the church and the
[1:13:47] first thing you know what does he do
[1:13:50] he builds the same thing that he come to
[1:13:53] drive out of another church then they
[1:13:58] have another church age then the first
[1:14:00] thing you know here comes the church
[1:14:02] ages in such a mess alone comes John
[1:14:05] Wesley another reformer see and builds
[1:14:10] another church age get what I mean
[1:14:12] another church age is built up there all
[1:14:15] reformers now he's explaining the zoo
[1:14:19] the street of what it took plays well
[1:14:22] notice this life's message of the life
[1:14:25] church age is not a reformer he's a
[1:14:34] prophet not a reformer
[1:14:36] show me where one prophet ever started a
[1:14:38] church age he's not a reformer he's a
[1:14:41] prophet
[1:14:42] others were reformers but not prophets
[1:14:44] if they would have been the word of the
[1:14:48] Lord comes to the Prophet that's the
[1:14:50] reason they continued on in the baptism
[1:14:52] of Father Son and Holy Ghost all these
[1:14:54] other things they were reformers and not
[1:14:56] prophets they didn't see why Luther was
[1:15:01] a Trinitarian baptized and father son
[1:15:04] hello right Wesley was a Trinitarian
[1:15:09] Azusa Street started out Trinitarian it
[1:15:14] was about 80 14 13 somewhere out in
[1:15:17] there that you get Haywood and them
[1:15:20] Seymour 19:30 excuse me you you see them
[1:15:26] start coming with the oneness doctrine
[1:15:31] right then brother Branham picks up to
[1:15:35] bring us the truth of the doctrine all
[1:15:39] right so now watch what he said because
[1:15:41] they were reformers not prophets but yet
[1:15:43] they were great men of God and saw the
[1:15:45] need of the day that they lived in and
[1:15:47] God anointed them and they sent out
[1:15:48] there and tore those things to pieces
[1:15:51] but the full word of
[1:15:52] I'd never come to them because they was
[1:15:55] not profits they were reformers so
[1:16:00] what's going to be restored the word the
[1:16:04] reformers had to move of God is that you
[1:16:08] see what he's saying the Reformers
[1:16:10] Luther Wesley Azusa Street even had to
[1:16:14] move of God but there was no profit to
[1:16:20] come to bring the word to restore the
[1:16:22] faith of the fathers come on one of the
[1:16:27] last days that'll have to be a profit to
[1:16:29] take up the mistress of God bring it
[1:16:31] back because the mistress was mistress
[1:16:33] was only known by prophets so it has to
[1:16:38] be this fella come see what I mean now
[1:16:41] he can't be a reformer it's got to be a
[1:16:44] prophet because it's got to be somebody
[1:16:46] that's gifted and said that Dyer that
[1:16:49] catches the word and then reformers know
[1:16:53] there was something wrong look Luther
[1:16:57] know that that that the bread wasn't the
[1:17:00] body of Christ and so he preached the
[1:17:02] just shall live by faith
[1:17:03] and that was his message and then and
[1:17:07] when John Wesley come along he saw that
[1:17:10] there was sanctification Troy preached
[1:17:12] sanctification that was his message see
[1:17:15] the Pentecostals brought in the message
[1:17:18] of the Holy Ghost and so forth but in
[1:17:21] the last days in this last age the
[1:17:24] messenger is not to start any
[1:17:26] Reformation but is to take all the
[1:17:29] mysteries that those reformers left off
[1:17:31] and getter them together and solve them
[1:17:34] to the church now do you see what I'm
[1:17:36] trying to get you to say see the statue
[1:17:39] of a perfect man is the faith of the
[1:17:41] fathers the word was lost to the ages
[1:17:47] they come out with Trinitarian doctrines
[1:17:50] they come out with all kind of things
[1:17:52] then a prophet had to be sent he had to
[1:17:59] come and try to preach the stature of a
[1:18:00] perfect man to give me in you an
[1:18:03] opportunity to believe it
[1:18:07] right he brings it up as far as he can
[1:18:10] bring it and he says I got him out on
[1:18:13] the limb what am I gonna do
[1:18:14] and God said that enough yet Malachi
[1:18:16] Ford not fulfill he thought it was come
[1:18:24] on but it takes a prophet see it took
[1:18:29] the Prophet to go back and get those
[1:18:30] things that's why they were reformers
[1:18:37] now come on don't be no smart at it with
[1:18:40] me I try to be just as plain as I can I
[1:18:42] know the quotes come on I can quote you
[1:18:45] Herbert around cause Luther a prophet he
[1:18:48] calls Wesley a prophet he calls the Holy
[1:18:51] Ghost he came on as US history a prophet
[1:18:53] come on I can quote with you so don't
[1:18:56] just go running on say he don't know
[1:18:57] what he's talking about like how I know
[1:18:59] where the Prophet said that Luther was a
[1:19:01] prophet he was a prophet because the
[1:19:04] just shall live by faith
[1:19:05] came to him Wesley was a prophet because
[1:19:12] the word came to him but the age and the
[1:19:16] time was reformers they could not go any
[1:19:20] further because there was nobody in
[1:19:23] Luther West their Pentecost to be able
[1:19:26] to go back and get that faith of the
[1:19:30] fathers and bring it out and show what
[1:19:33] had been eating away come on I'm done
[1:19:36] running too late now so we'll pick up
[1:19:38] this one if you want to you read
[1:19:39] restoration the rod tree well that's
[1:19:43] where we'll start up from because those
[1:19:45] four messengers ate it down the four
[1:19:47] messengers we'll bring it back right
[1:19:54] whatever took it away is gonna bring it
[1:19:56] back but just get the prophet or what
[1:19:59] you say it he said Martin Luther was a
[1:20:03] reformer he said John Wesley was a
[1:20:06] reformer he's even call Azusa Street the
[1:20:10] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:20:12] back
[1:20:13] he calls it Reformation why
[1:20:17] because it was a restoration to the
[1:20:20] gills Luther was arrested right now
[1:20:23] listen you say yeah but now you're
[1:20:24] blabbering called you running off Luther
[1:20:26] was a restoration of the just a little
[1:20:28] by faith
[1:20:30] Wesley was a restoration of
[1:20:32] sanctification that was written in the
[1:20:34] Bible Azusa Street was a restoration of
[1:20:39] the gifts remember take that gift all
[1:20:41] the way and don't dis run it with gifts
[1:20:43] take it to the fivefold ministry and his
[1:20:45] gifts take it or the prophets say it is
[1:20:52] you've got to be in the body to have one
[1:20:54] of these gifts what's he talking about
[1:20:57] stature of a perfect man those anointed
[1:21:01] ones can have all kind of guilt get the
[1:21:05] prophets message and understand it
[1:21:07] please Church because listen let me give
[1:21:12] you one thing in will end it I'll back
[1:21:14] up and come back to this but let me give
[1:21:18] you one thing if we can run over her to
[1:21:20] it to show you how this prophets message
[1:21:24] we talk about melikhaya for we talk
[1:21:27] about it 327 Church age book this
[1:21:29] messenger of Malachi 4 is going to do
[1:21:31] two things 1 turn the hearts for the
[1:21:32] children back to the faith of the father
[1:21:34] to reveal the seven thunders which is
[1:21:36] revelation contained in the seven seals
[1:21:38] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:21:40] truths that literally turn us back
[1:21:46] Malachi 4 says what behold I send you
[1:21:50] Elijah you'll turn the hearts of the
[1:21:53] children to the faith of the fathers
[1:21:56] I mean fathers to the children turning
[1:21:59] them to the New Testament message and
[1:22:00] the heart of the children to their
[1:22:02] fathers now that's two different
[1:22:04] Elijah's right Elisha number one turns
[1:22:07] the children turn the father's to the
[1:22:09] children and new testament message which
[1:22:11] fulfills Luke 1:17 okay alright and the
[1:22:16] hearts of the children to their fathers
[1:22:18] turn us back to the faith of the father
[1:22:20] reason I say Luke 1:17 see we win the
[1:22:23] organization we talked things you had
[1:22:28] never heard it said this away John
[1:22:30] turned them
[1:22:31] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:22:33] children he pointed to Jesus then he
[1:22:36] turned around and turned them back go
[1:22:38] Luke's 117 sounds like his go ahead get
[1:22:42] looking 7 170 no come on get that one
[1:22:44] it's right in front of you know Luke
[1:22:47] 1:17 ok here we go
[1:22:50] they'll have joy and gladness talking
[1:22:52] about John the Baptist where he shall be
[1:22:54] great in the sight of the Lord and
[1:22:55] she'll drink neither wine nor strong
[1:22:57] great John the Baptist and many of the
[1:22:59] children of Israel shall he turned to
[1:23:01] the Lord their God amen and he shall go
[1:23:05] before him in the spirit and the power
[1:23:08] of allies to turn the hearts of the
[1:23:10] fathers to the children
[1:23:12] that's melikhaya for that we've just
[1:23:14] read now watch and the disobedient to
[1:23:18] the wisdom of the just that's been
[1:23:22] taught by people in this message talk
[1:23:26] this way John the Baptist's come and
[1:23:29] turned it and then John turned it right
[1:23:31] back because that's what he'd be doing
[1:23:34] see if he turned him had him turned it
[1:23:36] from the father's to the children and
[1:23:38] then if you want and then let him turn
[1:23:41] the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:23:42] just you turn it right back under the
[1:23:44] law you say that ain't out that's been
[1:23:47] taught this message why wouldn't you
[1:23:52] listening
[1:23:57] somebody was told right here in this
[1:23:58] pulpit but not my brother mode so I'll
[1:24:00] make sure block that but listen Church
[1:24:07] do you know this scripture you know that
[1:24:11] Elijah is promised in the Word of God as
[1:24:13] a top do you know it go ahead with an
[1:24:20] extra kings you got it
[1:24:26] roll it a little closer I have to get to
[1:24:28] the king dirty now remember what this is
[1:24:32] about this is Mount Carmel go read it
[1:24:37] back this is Mount Carmel now what
[1:24:41] happened at Mount Carmel watch it
[1:24:44] and brother Brennan said ever born-again
[1:24:46] believer as a Mount Carmel experienced
[1:24:52] it came to pass on the time of the
[1:24:54] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:24:56] Elijah the Prophet came near and said
[1:24:58] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let
[1:25:01] me be known this day that dark God in
[1:25:03] Israel and that I am thy servant and
[1:25:07] that I have done all these things at thy
[1:25:11] word you remember what happened back
[1:25:13] before then he restored the altar right
[1:25:16] you had him to dig around him to pour
[1:25:18] water he restored the altar remember
[1:25:21] that now watch what he said here o Lord
[1:25:24] hear me that this people may know that
[1:25:30] thou art the Lord God and that thou has
[1:25:35] turned their heart back again that's the
[1:25:43] natural Israel because they walk with
[1:25:45] Moses and they fathered Moses a lot of
[1:25:51] them didn't went the other way and died
[1:25:52] but Moses returned the altar he built it
[1:25:56] all back he brought the word the brother
[1:25:58] run says he restored the word Elijah
[1:26:03] brought the word the building back of
[1:26:05] the altar and then when he did remember
[1:26:07] he told him said dig a ditch around them
[1:26:09] pour full of water pour the water all
[1:26:11] over everything said let's see whose God
[1:26:17] that's what I love know that thou art
[1:26:21] the Lord God and that thou has turned
[1:26:23] their heart back again
[1:26:27] that's this last days church the Prophet
[1:26:32] had to get everything back in order but
[1:26:34] Aaron's message had to restore the altar
[1:26:37] had to restore all the things that the
[1:26:40] children of Israel back gar they had
[1:26:42] allowed the enemy to take down and when
[1:26:45] it was restored back then the fire fail
[1:26:49] you get this message in the right order
[1:26:51] and keep on going with it fires gonna
[1:26:53] follow one day you said well what are
[1:26:55] you looking for the fire to follow
[1:26:58] what if I got a right to look for the
[1:26:59] fire to fall I got the pipes behind it I
[1:27:02] got the words of the Prophet I got the
[1:27:04] Bible that says it then he'll turn the
[1:27:06] hearts or their children back to the
[1:27:09] faith of the fathers and he says back
[1:27:14] gar said Lord and a Mount Carmel
[1:27:17] experience I wouldn't want it said it
[1:27:18] but run said ever born-again believer
[1:27:20] had a Mount Carmel experience in your
[1:27:26] Mount Carmel experience you're going to
[1:27:28] realize the word is right the Prophet
[1:27:32] brought the message he brought the fact
[1:27:37] of the restorer in the faith of the
[1:27:38] father's then his message started as he
[1:27:43] said in 62 spoken words original see all
[1:27:47] I do Lord I've done everything you said
[1:27:50] to do I've got it all the tops and
[1:27:52] shadows and everything right read the
[1:27:53] book he was right he had everything
[1:27:55] right God verse out it by saying pick up
[1:27:58] your pen and write it's in bold letter
[1:27:59] he's writing they wrote God wrote it and
[1:28:02] he was writing it down he stopped and
[1:28:07] the Spirit says that no yet Malachi 4 is
[1:28:11] not fulfilled when did Malachi 4 come
[1:28:14] into being the hearts of the children to
[1:28:17] be turned back to the faith of the
[1:28:18] fathers and then it's got to go on it's
[1:28:21] got to go on to the change of these
[1:28:23] bodies it's got to go on to the things
[1:28:26] that the Word of God shows and Elijah
[1:28:29] back yonder at Mount Carmel said Lord
[1:28:31] let them know their hearts have been
[1:28:33] turned back let me ask you some
[1:28:37] questions and see what your answer is
[1:28:40] and many gods do you have okay how many
[1:28:46] God did this disciples higher
[1:28:54] did this not did a disciple to
[1:28:56] understand predestination they wrote it
[1:29:03] do you understand predestination how did
[1:29:10] the apostles baptize how do you baptize
[1:29:22] are you getting what I'm saying if you
[1:29:25] think for a little bit about your own
[1:29:27] experience you will realize in your
[1:29:30] experience you've turned back to the
[1:29:34] faith of the Father if not we have to be
[1:29:38] put it that way if not we have to be
[1:29:41] because if we don't we're not going in
[1:29:44] the change we may go by the grave I'm
[1:29:49] sorry I didn't say it God told me I come
[1:29:53] and said it 40 years ago that the
[1:29:56] biggest portions of people this message
[1:29:58] would die and go by the grave I'll
[1:29:59] probably be just as much in that bigger
[1:30:02] mess as everything else is but I ain't
[1:30:05] worried about it because it's not it not
[1:30:07] that way it's the fact that we know what
[1:30:09] they're waiting on you and I
[1:30:11] they've done their part they fulfilled
[1:30:14] their part the great ones that have
[1:30:16] walked before you and I that have taught
[1:30:19] us this message they've left us with a
[1:30:22] point that we at least have an
[1:30:24] inheritance we've got something that we
[1:30:27] can claim for our own it's not a
[1:30:30] dishonor to go by the grave it's their
[1:30:32] honor
[1:30:34] it doesn't mean they don't have the
[1:30:37] faith they haven't may have a whole lot
[1:30:39] more faith than we've got but yet it's
[1:30:42] still the truth it's going to be a small
[1:30:48] group that comes to that change of the
[1:30:49] body that's what we were talking about
[1:30:52] Saturday night when they were destined
[1:30:55] the question was asked well all born
[1:30:57] into getting believers go in the rapture
[1:30:59] run around said no what he said that's
[1:31:06] some question as an answer
[1:31:07] sixty-four he said no he said only the
[1:31:12] remanent you mean ain't nobody going but
[1:31:20] a little bit of grouping in time come on
[1:31:23] church what's he talking about he ain't
[1:31:27] talking about as it was tried to be
[1:31:29] explained that that was a the people out
[1:31:32] there that claim the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:33] Ghost they didn't ask him that question
[1:31:35] they asked him a question we're all
[1:31:37] born-again believers going to rapture
[1:31:40] what was his answer
[1:31:42] no only the elect the group well because
[1:31:49] he's talking about the change in a
[1:31:51] moment a twink that we're not only the
[1:31:53] remnant will stand here and be changed
[1:31:55] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the
[1:31:57] rest are depending upon you and I to be
[1:32:00] able to make their body change I tried
[1:32:05] to explain it there Saturday all I could
[1:32:08] do just say it you can't put him to
[1:32:11] answering questions wrong in this age
[1:32:13] doing this but put it to a sensible
[1:32:16] answer he said they were just a remanent
[1:32:19] they're just going to be a little group
[1:32:21] that's gonna take the change in the
[1:32:22] moment a twinkling of an eye with the
[1:32:24] rest of I think I ought to do it because
[1:32:26] the dead in Christ shall rise first the
[1:32:30] dead in Christ shall rise before you in
[1:32:32] our change their resurrection and they
[1:32:37] is their change they don't come for that
[1:32:39] old people and then are changed into
[1:32:41] young people they come out of that away
[1:32:45] that they are in Christ and you and I
[1:32:49] will be standing there they're dependent
[1:32:52] upon us there's just a little bit of a
[1:32:55] group of people that's going to take the
[1:32:57] chains in a moment the twinkle of an eye
[1:32:59] I snap my fingers because people on tape
[1:33:01] will know where I'm talking about I'm
[1:33:02] talking about the change the change
[1:33:04] every born-again believer goes in the
[1:33:06] rapture ever born to get believer goes
[1:33:11] in the rapture but they're waiting on
[1:33:14] you and I to come to the message
[1:33:20] this profit has brought us to the main
[1:33:21] stage I don't see why we couldn't go
[1:33:26] with the scriptures and the things that
[1:33:27] we are and to say the fossils taught it
[1:33:31] this is what we teach you that away do
[1:33:33] you think you got to face the father's I
[1:33:35] say it's here ain't got no argument
[1:33:38] about it if you ask brother Branham did
[1:33:41] he have the faith his father's he
[1:33:42] probably answered the same question he'd
[1:33:44] say it don't look like it because he
[1:33:50] said at the end estatua program at Lord
[1:33:52] fill me up with this virtue knowledge
[1:33:54] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:33:56] kindness that I may teach others see the
[1:34:05] word is right we don't have to prop up
[1:34:10] nothing to do nothing we just have to
[1:34:12] believe it and then see what he's
[1:34:15] talking about
[1:34:16] I never D Christian I was nobody when I
[1:34:22] said that I didn't say it I told it 40
[1:34:24] years ago that God told me the biggest
[1:34:26] portion of people would die and go by
[1:34:28] the grave and I said then they're
[1:34:30] believers in this message they're not
[1:34:31] just the world people we know they're
[1:34:33] going that way but most of people this
[1:34:36] message know nothing about the message
[1:34:39] that the Prophet is brought I told you
[1:34:46] I'm sorry but see we take this and we do
[1:34:50] that with it and I told you we stood in
[1:34:54] front of probably 1012 ministers talking
[1:34:58] on Daniel 70 weeks and you know a lot of
[1:35:00] them ministers had never read Daniel 70
[1:35:03] weeks did not even have a book but yet
[1:35:07] they could explain all about what
[1:35:08] brother Branham was talking about
[1:35:18] he says on Daniel 70 weeks he said if
[1:35:20] you don't understand this he said you
[1:35:22] can't understand the seals it's on the
[1:35:24] inside of your book it's on the front
[1:35:26] page of your book turn that Daniel 70
[1:35:29] weeks book and open it up and look on
[1:35:30] the first page right there it has it
[1:35:33] that you can't understand these things
[1:35:34] you can't understand the seals and the
[1:35:37] things without understand within what's
[1:35:38] wrong with trying to understand that's
[1:35:46] tan you think on these things we'll
[1:35:49] finish the next week Sunday the Lord
[1:35:51] with it
[1:35:53] think on these things this message has
[1:36:01] all the answers yet we can turn down the
[1:36:07] answers and the things and let it go
[1:36:12] into dub ears death of years would call
[1:36:18] them come on brothers brother Aaron the
[1:36:21] new East brothers come on getting ready
[1:36:24] to sing but let's pray for these four we
[1:36:26] won't forget it for the Bob come on
[1:36:31] let's pray over these because they want
[1:36:33] to take them and give them to the people

[1:44:11] are we trying to reform or do we want
[1:44:18] restoration reform is to just try to
[1:44:23] stop from doing things that we were
[1:44:26] doing
[1:44:30] restoration is to bring within us and
[1:44:33] let the virtues be living to outwardly
[1:44:36] remember the quote the other day these
[1:44:39] virtues must come from the inside
[1:44:42] reclamation is just quitting this or
[1:44:44] quit now oh that's wonderful
[1:44:47] but is no salvation involved reclamation
[1:44:51] is a reformer
[1:44:57] we need restoration
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:07] just remember my one brother Alvin him
[1:45:11] was asking about sister Anna my nephew
[1:45:13] he got run over by truck backed over and
[1:45:17] they've already done one operation on
[1:45:19] his lagging and then I think his
[1:45:21] shoulder and now they're going back to
[1:45:23] do another operation and to fix his
[1:45:26] shoulder and everything and just pray
[1:45:29] for him but he just got beat up all over
[1:45:31] you know and just pray that the Lord
[1:45:34] would touch him and bring him through
[1:45:36] these things
[1:45:37] oh this a day and the time is you an
[1:45:40] hour to be concerned more than ever in
[1:45:45] their hearts and our lives about the day
[1:45:46] and hour that we're living well
[1:45:55] what we're doing
[1:45:59] would you can you come up okay wait a
[1:46:06] minute
[1:46:40] March and they convinced me they need to
[1:46:43] go fishing so I and the car daddy to ask
[1:46:46] him if he would come with him and daddy
[1:46:48] said he didn't feel like it poppin tell
[1:46:52] him to go fishing with us so I can't pop
[1:46:54] in Papa said he would he came I got the
[1:46:57] boys went fishing left mama with us came
[1:47:00] back brought the boys back he didn't
[1:47:02] come in mama went out and got in the car
[1:47:04] and he went home and dropped I believe
[1:47:19] it I know what he told somebody else had
[1:47:23] told me he said I enjoyed going to
[1:47:26] church at Lula won't have any time other
[1:47:29] than back under and going to jail he was
[1:47:34] a good old brother a good man he was a
[1:47:37] wonderful fella you know what years ago
[1:47:46] the Lord told me missus don't a it's
[1:47:49] been on record for years that God would
[1:47:53] send some people from Athens Georgia to
[1:47:56] be a part of this group they have many
[1:48:00] of them come but the dawn again was one
[1:48:08] that he told me
[1:48:10] my brother Donnie come he said brother
[1:48:13] Dale he said I think I was done wrong
[1:48:17] and I need to repent and get straight
[1:48:21] but he said I think I need to go get
[1:48:24] baptized he said I'm going to
[1:48:26] Jeffersonville and get baptized great
[1:48:29] praise the Lord brother that's what you
[1:48:31] need go do it
[1:48:33] few days later he came back and he said
[1:48:35] brother Dale I've been thinking about it
[1:48:37] he said the same God it's in
[1:48:40] Jeffersonville Indiana is in a Lula
[1:48:42] Georgia he said will you baptize me I
[1:48:46] said yes sir there's only one person
[1:48:51] that he spoke to me about
[1:48:53] has it come that's Betty Cunningham
[1:48:58] she's it a nursing home I've seen him
[1:49:05] work too much to not be concerned I just
[1:49:08] don't talk about it because see that
[1:49:10] gets you building well I'm the brother
[1:49:12] bill have you seen this is no don't get
[1:49:14] into all that let's just get into God's
[1:49:16] Word and just tell what God says to you
[1:49:18] you know it's any problem any problem
[1:49:22] we're saying the Lord showed me this or
[1:49:23] the Lord showed me they have does that
[1:49:25] make us see that no it makes a good god
[1:49:29] we've seen a lot of the miracles and the
[1:49:32] signs and wonders from the dead raised
[1:49:34] the sick yield of all forms sure we need
[1:49:42] more of God but I am satisfied where I'm
[1:49:47] at you may not believe but I'm satisfied
[1:49:51] in the position that God has brought me
[1:49:54] and put me to the place of understanding
[1:49:58] I know he'll curious own because he
[1:50:06] promised it well can't we just depend
[1:50:10] upon his promises I'm shouted glory for
[1:50:14] the victory or the restoration that he
[1:50:19] promised
[1:50:20] because we got to get the restoration
[1:50:22] right then you can talk about the things
[1:50:27] that are not dealing with restoration
[1:50:31] but are dealing with the spoken word
[1:50:37] those seals to me is the headstone to
[1:50:41] the church I'll always believe that you
[1:50:44] know why because God spoke through a man
[1:50:49] the secret things that no man has ever
[1:50:55] understood is that not according to the
[1:51:02] logos the speech the things you don't
[1:51:09] ever think about we talk about the faith
[1:51:12] of the fathers and how those people
[1:51:13] learn their word they brought you
[1:51:15] realize they did now nobody to study
[1:51:17] over it and to talk about it and get it
[1:51:19] straight now God spoke to him and they
[1:51:26] pinned it down and that is the Word of
[1:51:30] God what a day Father be with us on the
[1:51:37] way home take care of everybody give a
[1:51:38] safe journey
[1:51:39] thank you for touching the floor and
[1:51:41] just have your way with each one now
[1:51:43] that's your light shine into our hearts
[1:51:45] we love you in Jesus name Amen
[1:51:48] you dismiss
[1:51:50] [Music]
