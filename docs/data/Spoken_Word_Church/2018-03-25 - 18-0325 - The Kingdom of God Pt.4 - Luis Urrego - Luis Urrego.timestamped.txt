[0:01] kind of to go alright alright last week
[0:05] we ended up talking about when Jesus met
[0:11] with Nicodemus Jesus met with Nicodemus
[0:15] and told them you know you cannot even
[0:17] see and seeing me and understand you
[0:20] cannot even understand the kingdom of
[0:22] God without you even being born again
[0:24] right and and Jesus brought that in
[0:29] that's so important you know for you too
[0:31] to be born again for you to understand
[0:34] the word and looking at something last
[0:38] night is interesting that Jesus he tells
[0:41] him and we can look over but he tells
[0:42] the disciples he says he says in
[0:45] different different times he says after
[0:47] he's given them a parable of some sort
[0:50] trying to teach him something he's given
[0:52] him to it he's preached to everybody
[0:54] reached the parable and he and then
[0:56] after the parable the disciples don't
[0:58] understand much and so they asked they
[1:01] asked Jesus may say Jesus tell us what
[1:05] this means that we don't understand and
[1:08] several times he replaced him he says
[1:10] blessed are you for it to you is given
[1:13] to know the mysteries of the King does
[1:16] run right to know
[1:19] now that's key because it was something
[1:20] we were talking about in regarding to a
[1:22] question that sister Trudy had asked
[1:24] last Sunday he said can a sinner get a
[1:26] revelation and what's interesting is
[1:31] that Jesus tells them isn't it it's
[1:33] given for you to know now you can have a
[1:36] knowledge but before you can become a
[1:38] before you get a new birth was because
[1:41] the disciples because Jesus then after
[1:43] it he explains to them what these what
[1:45] these parables meant but they really
[1:48] didn't get an under full understanding
[1:51] until that knew that that word they come
[1:54] alive until the new birth they
[1:55] experience on the Upper Room
[1:57] so there's many times and we'll go over
[1:59] in just a moment we'll read it you read
[2:00] the scripture but I thought that that
[2:01] was so very interesting because you can
[2:04] have a knowledge of this word again I
[2:07] got said last Sunday many
[2:08] we'll have had a knowledge of this
[2:10] message that God sent a prophet and and
[2:14] all these things they can really read
[2:15] the books and all that but that has
[2:18] nothing to do if you receiving the
[2:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[2:21] that's just you know me right something
[2:24] right and many people who have known
[2:27] something are still coming out they're
[2:31] leaving they say well this is what I'm
[2:34] going for now leaving the you know
[2:37] leaving the word you know and I call I
[2:39] say hop in the word leave the word no
[2:42] all right so how do you enter into this
[2:47] kingdom we talked about we've talked
[2:49] about what the kingdom is not right we
[2:53] talked about almost in your you're
[2:56] almost into the kingdom but not really
[2:58] in the kingdom right now we're gonna
[3:00] Behati enter into this kingdom or the
[3:02] question better yet is how does his
[3:04] kingdom enter into you and so brother
[3:07] Branham says here I like what he says
[3:08] here you are born into the kingdom of
[3:11] God how by the Holy Ghost
[3:13] that's God's witness he gives what is by
[3:16] the Word of God that we've passed from
[3:17] death unto life because we are in the
[3:19] kingdom of God and then another area he
[3:22] says no matter what it looks like here
[3:23] we don't look at what we see me look at
[3:25] what we do not see that's that's key is
[3:29] that right anyhow to see doesn't mean to
[3:32] look at the word see means to understand
[3:34] Jesus said except a man be born of water
[3:36] and spirit he cannot see the kingdom of
[3:39] God in other words he can't understand
[3:41] the kingdom of God until he's born again
[3:43] see you have to accept it by faith
[3:47] that's key you have to accept it by
[3:50] faith right down here
[3:54] that's why you're born again down here
[3:56] Ezra and then when he comes into you
[3:59] understand it that's the reason why that
[4:03] brother Dale was bringing something so
[4:05] key and if you were there listening to
[4:08] two two ones days ago I believe it was
[4:10] and I'd suggest you go back to in it go
[4:14] back and start listening to Lisa from
[4:15] the part where he's been speaking about
[4:17] this born-again series he was talking
[4:20] about faith faith is the substance right
[4:23] faith is the substance of things hoped
[4:26] for the evidence of things not seen you
[4:28] can't see that faith that's the reason
[4:31] why you can't explain most of us can't
[4:33] explain our universe but we know is
[4:35] there we know it has happened but we
[4:39] can't go and tell it to everybody else
[4:40] we we can't explain it because it's all
[4:43] based by the word it's all through the
[4:46] word it's got to be it's got to be the
[4:48] foundation has to be the word you can't
[4:50] say you got the new birth because you
[4:51] shook the preachers hand or you or you
[4:53] did this no it's gotta be you got to
[4:55] hear the word first faith cometh by here
[4:57] and then here and and hearing the Word
[4:59] of God then it produced it could produce
[5:01] the new birth right you believe that
[5:03] wherever then it produces that new birth
[5:05] but that's so key because now I can't
[5:08] explain to you what happened to me in
[5:10] Columbia South America in 1999 I just
[5:13] know I had there was an experience that
[5:15] took place I didn't run I didn't shout I
[5:17] didn't I didn't scream I didn't make of
[5:20] a lot of noise I just know that
[5:22] something took place and from there a
[5:25] growth started taking place now it
[5:27] hasn't been easy but it's been worth
[5:31] that much
[5:32] it hasn't been easy and and I just
[5:37] remember and just this as a testimony I
[5:39] remember when I picked up the brother
[5:42] there in Columbia South America we went
[5:44] to his Columbia as Baptist gonna go pass
[5:47] out tracts to the family and and you
[5:50] know and then talk to the people on the
[5:51] streets and we just like good good old
[5:54] Baptist you know and and one of my mom's
[5:57] cousins had come into the message and
[5:59] she says he started explaining to us
[6:01] about what happened in the Garden of
[6:03] Eden that even Adam and Eve then eat no
[6:06] fruit it was a little act that took
[6:08] place and for that for a Baptist to hear
[6:11] something like that that is shocking I
[6:13] mean he just went straight to the point
[6:15] and that Cain was the son of the devil
[6:18] and all kinds of stuff he was new also
[6:20] but but he said well let's go talk to
[6:24] the pastor pastor talk to us and he just
[6:27] discussed to us about basic things about
[6:29] water baptism and lamb Lord Jesus Christ
[6:31] but it just it really really opened
[6:35] things up for me right there and one of
[6:37] the key things that he said because
[6:38] because the Baptist they said they don't
[6:40] believe in prophets prophets were all
[6:42] the way up to John yeah my mom asked the
[6:44] pastor there a question he said but the
[6:46] Bible says in the last days that there
[6:48] will be false prophets they said but if
[6:50] he said but if there's false prophets
[6:52] there has
[6:53] and that right there just so I got to I
[6:57] got I got to my aunt and started reading
[6:59] uh but first message I repect up was
[7:02] Christ to Mister God revealed and
[7:04] several pages into that message one of
[7:07] the first quake one of the questions I
[7:08] always had in my mind was to why if God
[7:10] is eternal that they begin him from the
[7:12] end why in the world that he created man
[7:15] knowing that he was going to fall what
[7:18] that was a question I've had ever since
[7:20] I was a Christian at twelve years old
[7:22] and and about half way into that message
[7:26] my quarter half way brother Brandon says
[7:29] he talks start talking about God's
[7:31] attributes if he didn't if he if there
[7:33] was nobody to save and nobody had sinned
[7:36] and he can display that Savior attribute
[7:39] if there was nobody to heal
[7:41] there is nobody sick he couldn't display
[7:43] himself to be a healer you see so it all
[7:46] makes sense and I came running out of
[7:48] that room and I said are there I guess I
[7:49] did run my mom was watching the close
[7:54] with my aunt and she said and I said mom
[7:56] look what look what I read here and she
[7:59] was kind of busy she wasn't really
[8:01] paying attention to me so I just went
[8:02] back in the room and started continued
[8:03] reading but something just and then and
[8:06] then just things just started opening up
[8:09] to me and uh you know and then you learn
[8:13] about water baptism and one of the key
[8:14] things is you that is really revealed to
[8:17] you is that you go and do it you see
[8:19] because you can know it but not go do it
[8:22] that's just knowing right right amen so
[8:26] anyways alright so where the branch says
[8:32] here now there that's up comes a seat
[8:36] there's where your mind now jesus said
[8:38] except a man be born of a little girl
[8:40] you're sent to you except a man be born
[8:42] again you cannot see the kingdom of God
[8:43] now you couldn't see the kingdom of God
[8:45] because the kingdom of God is the Holy
[8:47] Spirit right some stand-in here will not
[8:53] taste of death till they see the kingdom
[8:54] of God coming in power Emma speaking
[8:56] about the disciples David right that
[9:01] power the Holy Spirit is the same thing
[9:02] right
[9:04] he was talking about they what they were
[9:06] going to spirits in the upper room he
[9:07] said then the kingdom of God the Bible
[9:09] said is within you is within you the
[9:12] Holy Spirit and you can't see it with
[9:14] your eyes so si means to understand
[9:17] so this kingdom you can't see it that's
[9:21] the reason why you can't explain it it's
[9:24] hard for you to explain to the people
[9:26] you just know it's there now Luke 17 20
[9:33] we're very familiar with these
[9:35] scriptures but look what we've read this
[9:38] before that jesus jesus answered the
[9:41] defero seized and said imagine when the
[9:43] kingdom of God should come they were
[9:45] looking for a physical Kingdom the Jews
[9:47] but Jesus replies that the kingdom of
[9:49] God cometh not with observation in other
[9:52] words the kingdom of God comes
[9:54] nobody knows anything about it nobody
[9:57] nobody it's not it's not something
[9:59] that's visible for the world to see
[10:02] something something you know not a show
[10:05] right correct there's not something that
[10:14] you can physically say but but now don't
[10:18] get me wrong those things are fine when
[10:21] the new birth is there right but don't
[10:24] put the cart before the horse because a
[10:28] lot of people put put there will I
[10:29] experience something there at the altar
[10:31] and I shouted and all that and then they
[10:35] go off living like the devil you know
[10:38] you've had an experience it was just on
[10:42] your flesh right because the rain falls
[10:45] on the just and the unjust
[10:50] neither
[10:51] verse 21 neither shall they say lo here
[10:53] or lo er therefore behold the kingdom of
[10:55] God is within you
[10:56] right now the kingdom of God is a
[11:00] mystery
[11:01] luke'll mark 4:11 says and he said
[11:03] to them unto you is given to know the
[11:06] mystery of the kingdom of God
[11:09] I like Jesus calls it the mystery right
[11:13] we'll get will look at something just a
[11:15] moment and then Luke 8:10 until you is
[11:18] given to know the mysteries of the
[11:21] kingdom of God but to others in parables
[11:23] that seem they might not see and hearing
[11:25] they might not understand that's why you
[11:30] can present this word to a lot of people
[11:32] and they keep taking it they can
[11:34] understand water baptism head knowledge
[11:37] but not but not go do it but once you
[11:48] get revelation you will do you will do
[11:50] it doesn't he there's no no there's no
[11:53] what my way Avenue you will be and
[11:55] that's why that's why the Jesus said I
[11:58] really believe he said for no see
[12:01] for the disciples to know see they
[12:03] didn't have the new birth at that time
[12:05] not sure it wasn't until the upper room
[12:06] and then we weren't actually took place
[12:08] then dwell under the Holy Spirit but
[12:10] they knew these mysteries they need but
[12:15] that then saved them right now look look
[12:21] what Colossians says in verse one verse
[12:23] 25 this kingdom of God is a mystery now
[12:26] revealed let's started yeah well I am
[12:32] made a minister according to the
[12:33] dispensation of God which is given to me
[12:35] for you to fulfill the Word of God even
[12:38] the mystery which have been hid from
[12:40] ages and from generations but now is
[12:44] made manifest to his Saints amen and
[12:48] what is this mystery to whom god would
[12:49] make know him what is the riches of the
[12:52] glory of this mystery among the gentiles
[12:54] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[12:57] endures
[12:58] that's the mystery that the world
[13:01] doesn't
[13:01] right and even some of us can't fully
[13:05] understand that especially in these in
[13:08] these and these Minds and these in the
[13:11] in these uh
[13:13] unregenerate admires you know that we
[13:15] have those right that christ would you
[13:18] know wants to reveal himself through me
[13:21] not just to me but thro right that's
[13:27] powerful you know yes amen i know we're
[13:31] being a lot of scripture sayings but
[13:33] yeah what else to read but the word go
[13:36] ahead so again it's difficult to explain
[13:40] your new birth yet you know it's taking
[13:42] place now Hebrews 11 going back to what
[13:44] whether Adele was preaching the other
[13:46] day he said faith Hebrews 11 now faith
[13:51] is the substance of things hoped for the
[13:53] evidence of things not seen for by it
[13:56] the elders obtained a good report
[13:57] through faith we understand that the
[14:00] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[14:01] that things which are seen were not is
[14:05] it how people quote that and say we're
[14:07] made I said but we're not made of things
[14:10] which do appear Shanta now I don't know
[14:15] if you remember was it last year or two
[14:17] years ago I preached a message called
[14:20] when God saw the light and I spoke about
[14:23] this quantum having heard of quantum
[14:25] mechanics now quantum mechanics
[14:28] basically what it's at what it's about
[14:30] is it's the it's the studying of the
[14:33] smallest particles that make up some
[14:36] atomic particles that make up matter
[14:38] right and in matter what the the the law
[14:42] of quanta of quantum mechanics says that
[14:45] this table is made up of molecules and
[14:49] those molecules are made up of atoms but
[14:53] then those atoms are made up of even
[14:55] smaller called quanta in quantity
[14:59] quantity cannot see but yet it's made up
[15:04] that table
[15:06] they know it's there but it's but yet it
[15:10] makes it makes a quantum makes of
[15:15] molecules know atoms and then atoms make
[15:18] up molecules and then now you have the
[15:20] table right and the thing is is that all
[15:23] these things are are held together by
[15:26] light as the reason why God said in the
[15:30] beginning in the beginning God created
[15:32] the heavens and earth and beginning
[15:35] there was there was light but that light
[15:38] wasn't light like the sunlight there's a
[15:41] midnight that light that is talking
[15:43] about is God's law event and God is
[15:46] light different and that's what holds
[15:48] everything together
[15:49] you can't seem it right you but you know
[15:54] it's holding everything together that's
[15:56] the reason why the scripture says here
[15:58] so that things which are seen were not
[16:01] made of things which do appear could you
[16:05] can't see you can't see those things but
[16:07] yet you know and science has proven that
[16:09] that is being held by quanta so so
[16:16] that's very that's very interesting
[16:18] that's the reason why we're held
[16:21] together by this new birth but we can't
[16:24] see it you can't you you the armor of
[16:32] the Christian is an unseen armor but you
[16:37] know it's there you have love you have
[16:41] joy peace but it only comes through the
[16:42] Holy Ghost but you can't see those
[16:44] things the only way you can see them is
[16:47] by them being manifested but you can't
[16:49] me show me love but Robin says show me
[16:53] in the house of love go to the store and
[16:56] buy me an ounce of love you can't go to
[16:58] the store buy me an ounce of joy you
[17:00] can't but it's manifested on the outside
[17:04] but it's got to be on the inside first
[17:06] all right amen
[17:09] so you have to receive see faith faith
[17:14] is the substance of things hoped for it
[17:17] it's the evidence of things not seen see
[17:20] when you have faith that's the evidence
[17:23] that you have the new birth when that
[17:27] faith is there then and it's not your
[17:31] own faith it's gotta be God's faith it
[17:36] can come and starts us you you know
[17:38] believing and your faith has to has to
[17:41] you know I believe what God said about
[17:43] me and but then that really turns into
[17:47] God puts his faith in you right that you
[17:50] can fully believe this work in a man
[17:53] and that's what the disciples did in the
[17:55] Upper Room amen
[17:56] that's the reason why they could take
[17:58] scriptures with Krita
[18:00] Papa Peter came preaching taking
[18:04] scriptures with Scripture putting things
[18:05] together because that word that they had
[18:07] heard for three and a half years was
[18:09] quickened it was made alive to them and
[18:13] then they could think it out 3,000 souls
[18:16] came to the kingdom that day name is
[18:19] James two five parking my beloved
[18:21] brethren hath not God chosen the poor of
[18:24] this world rich in faith I love that and
[18:29] heirs of the kingdom Haven that's you
[18:32] and me which he had promised to them
[18:34] that love him you say oh my my faith is
[18:38] weak the Bible says your faith is rich
[18:41] that's what it says and our new era of
[18:44] the kingdom brother Wayne is the only
[18:48] one that knows
[18:57] amen
[19:00] all right so very all right now look
[19:03] what brother Brown says here we'll just
[19:04] get down here the kingdom God's within
[19:07] you so you can actually see it less you
[19:09] see it operating but the only way you'll
[19:14] ever be able to understand it you've got
[19:16] to be born again to be born again you've
[19:18] been filled with God's Spirit then
[19:20] you're in Christ and when you're in
[19:23] Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the
[19:26] Bible that manifested Christ is in you
[19:28] to recognize like this to recognize his
[19:30] own self amen that's an image that's the
[19:37] little innocent one yes very good very
[19:40] going on in just a moment shut up
[19:43] yeah praise God good job so the kingdom
[19:53] of God is made up of attributes that
[19:55] cannot be seen or understood by the
[19:56] natural man any reason why the Bible
[19:59] says the natural man doesn't understand
[20:00] the word go nope doesn't understand that
[20:04] King because it's not it's not it's not
[20:08] something obvious but yet it is to the
[20:13] born-again Christian program says also
[20:19] the Christian looks at things that he
[20:21] doesn't see with his eyes know this is
[20:25] very interesting for we look at the
[20:27] unseen sees how do you look at it with
[20:30] your inside eyes you see it by faith and
[20:33] now to prove that the whole Christian
[20:35] armor is made up of unseen qualities
[20:38] what is a Christian armor somebody says
[20:41] seeing is believing that person would
[20:43] never be a Christian because the armor
[20:45] of the Christian is made up of this love
[20:47] did you ever see it you see it in action
[20:50] but you've never seen love if you can
[20:53] pull your part of love out and let me
[20:55] see what it looks like see look love joy
[20:58] peace longsuffering good
[20:59] meekness faith Jen let's see the whole
[21:02] Christian armor is unseen with the
[21:04] natural eye but it is understood by the
[21:06] heart there you are there you are
[21:10] so you you're made up of these things
[21:12] like quantum right molecules all these
[21:17] things but it's made up foundationally
[21:19] of things that cannot be seen I'm just
[21:23] taking using the natural tighten it with
[21:25] the spiritual first Corinthians before
[21:29] but I will come to you shortly in the
[21:32] Lord will and will note not the speech
[21:34] of them which are puffed up but the
[21:37] power now the key no God is not in word
[21:40] but in power not driving for the kingdom
[21:43] of God is none where further in power so
[21:46] that's the reason why the letter killeth
[21:49] that's the reason you can read this word
[21:53] and you can reap this message and they
[21:56] kill you in the end yep because you're
[22:00] reading it mentally or fleshly alright
[22:02] you can take one quote you can take
[22:05] another quote and you can make it say
[22:07] like brother they'll same last week and
[22:09] make it say whatever you want I say
[22:10] you're right
[22:11] same thing with the word you can take
[22:14] you can take the scripture and and they
[22:16] can prove so prove father son Holy Ghost
[22:20] a Trinity movement right but that same
[22:23] Scripture speaks of one God to you and
[22:25] me daily but to them it's a Trinity
[22:28] right you can make it say whether the
[22:30] letter killeth but the Spirit give it
[22:33] life right amen
[22:37] so this message could kill you if that
[22:41] power is not there to guide you to put
[22:43] these things together in their proper
[22:44] place or in a balanced way by so many
[22:47] even so many doctors even amongst a
[22:49] message okay no because McKee and I
[22:55] learned this several years ago that a
[22:57] lot of people who trouble reach any
[22:59] doctrine whatever the doctor may be you
[23:01] know false doctrine and they'll always
[23:04] take you back is two quotes they will
[23:07] never take you to the word address they
[23:10] never they never David
[23:12] they might say a scripture here too but
[23:14] their foundation is the quote because
[23:16] they can make brother Brown say whatever
[23:18] they wanted whatever they want him to
[23:20] say but that's but member program said
[23:24] faith the Word of God is that's where
[23:26] our faith relies on it rests on on the
[23:29] Word of God that's where that's our
[23:31] foundation right and so you ask these
[23:35] big boys it'll show me a scripture and
[23:37] then they can produce a screamer
[23:39] to back that that doctrine me that
[23:41] whatever they're preaching but they'll
[23:42] always produce a quote that's kind of
[23:46] interesting and that's the reason why it
[23:49] quote can kill you not that the court
[23:51] itself is back it's just that it can
[23:53] kill us spiritually but when it's not
[23:56] put in the right place
[23:57] amen so what is this power acts 1:8
[24:02] Jesus told them he said but ye shall
[24:04] receive power and that's that Dunamis
[24:06] Dunamis is the greek word for that power
[24:09] because in act in in matthew chapter 10
[24:12] and in another scripture Jesus gave the
[24:15] disciples power to go cast out Devils
[24:19] but heal the sick and do all these
[24:21] things but that was before their new
[24:24] birth they could do these things even
[24:27] Judas was right there amongst them was
[24:30] performing these miracles he gave them
[24:32] power but that power was not the same
[24:33] power he could you looked at and you
[24:35] look those two words in the Greek that's
[24:37] different this is the word Dunamis and
[24:38] the other one is EXO sia
[24:40] two different powers this power right
[24:43] here has to do with the changing of the
[24:45] so limit with the with the with with the
[24:48] soul amen
[24:49] the other one is just external this is
[24:52] the power that changed them there's
[24:54] there's their soul chemin enters that
[24:56] because the new birth is in your soul
[24:59] it's not God put another soul in you no
[25:02] no he's just renewing that that soul you
[25:04] know he's making it he's putting his
[25:07] soul in you amen what what is the Holy
[25:11] Ghost that's God soul yo man I'm truly
[25:14] man David receive power Dunamis after
[25:18] that the Holy Ghost has come up
[25:20] then that's when ye shall be witnesses
[25:22] unto me both in Jerusalem journey and
[25:24] all Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[25:26] of the world and that power is that
[25:29] Kingdom
[25:30] remember we said we've said the power
[25:32] that that kingdom of God is is the Holy
[25:34] Ghost all right Luke 9:27 but I tell you
[25:44] of a truth there be some standing here
[25:47] which shall not taste of death till they
[25:49] see the kingdom of God faith that was to
[25:52] the disciples and they saw the kingdom
[25:55] of God in that Upper Room everything I
[25:58] was on that little kingdom but they
[26:02] experienced the kingdom that Kingdom
[26:04] started changing and producing more
[26:08] Kingdom people but amen the 3000 program
[26:12] says listen closely the kingdom of God
[26:15] is his word made power right if you want
[26:20] to put that down for spending 430 know
[26:21] God is God's word make powder what is
[26:23] this king of God is within you
[26:25] the kingdoms in you and when the word
[26:27] comes in there what does this word begin
[26:29] it turns itself into power making it
[26:31] just say exactly what it said you stay
[26:35] with the word there it is see and it
[26:36] makes it power Jesus Christ the same
[26:38] yesterday today and forever
[26:42] that's why the words so important things
[26:45] amen the fountain you know the the to
[26:50] read 202 a Christian to a believer the
[26:53] word means everything to them how can
[26:56] you how can you you know you've heard
[26:59] people say I'll take it
[27:01] I'll take this they'll literally hold
[27:04] message book in one hand and the Bible
[27:05] in one hand and say I'll take this over
[27:07] this because this is the revelation of
[27:09] this that doesn't make any sense
[27:20] right right
[27:23] exactly what sad thing but the thing is
[27:27] is that you know I'm someone some
[27:29] someone said one time well I'll just
[27:31] take what brother Brennan said after
[27:33] 1965 or 1963 after the seals and you and
[27:37] I say I say well the Bible was written
[27:39] before 1963 then the brother brandy
[27:44] preached out of the Bible before 1963
[27:48] you know so it goes hand in hand brother
[27:53] Graham didn't come here to do away with
[27:55] the Bible right he came here to to to to
[27:59] make that Bible alive right that's that
[28:03] same spirit you made when people you
[28:05] talk about what happened in the Old
[28:07] Testament you go do around the 29 X well
[28:11] that's the over there we'll take the new
[28:13] Y and I said we'll wake up them Ten
[28:15] Commandments out in the yard out there
[28:17] right
[28:18] I mean everybody lives by the Ten
[28:20] Commandment everybody sings while the
[28:21] Ten Commandments you know that's Old
[28:23] Testament yeah thank that same devil
[28:26] comes and says I'll take what he says
[28:28] accentuate III up then to prevail like
[28:32] you say this all there anyway you guys
[28:34] do not want you much well just carried
[28:36] out quick read another round don't
[28:38] everything away from 63 backwards
[28:41] because you need it but you can't do
[28:43] that can you gonna commend it every you
[28:46] needed that them that restorations
[28:48] ministry of brother Brandon if that was
[28:50] like talking to us absolutely started in
[28:52] 47 yeah kept talking till name I say you
[28:55] started even before that has just
[28:57] started being recorded in 1947 but but
[29:01] the well we know his true message was
[29:03] when those seals were open sure we know
[29:06] that was his message no that was his
[29:08] true message that's right but we needed
[29:11] that restoration we needed that those
[29:13] years of restoration right before we
[29:16] could understand this right if you don't
[29:18] get the Foundation's right then you
[29:20] won't understand that heads
[29:21] right that's that's that's the word
[29:24] phrase done so you have to I say I'm
[29:27] gonna build the roof
[29:28] forget the foundation we're gonna build
[29:30] the roof Oh what and that's the reason
[29:35] why you know and that's where that's why
[29:37] we're probably gonna have to go over
[29:38] there next next time I'll talk I'll talk
[29:41] to him brother anybody remember that
[29:45] image that Daniel saw a brother brother
[29:47] bought for a Bob's mentioned this before
[29:49] but that image that Daniel saw it was
[29:51] built from the head and down we are
[29:54] built from the feet up you see there's a
[29:58] foundation that found that Satan's image
[30:02] for Satan's Kingdom has no foundation it
[30:07] looks good from the head down but
[30:11] eventually it'll crumble David I will
[30:13] get to that Lake now God's kingdom is
[30:16] not of this world and when Christ was
[30:18] here he give us the program of this
[30:20] kingdom he gave us the program of God
[30:22] scheme that the father's Kingdom which
[30:24] is his word now is the key so the
[30:27] kingdom is the Holy Ghost his word power
[30:31] it's all this thing ever now if you want
[30:35] to know how you get into a kingdom this
[30:37] words got it well just let's see when
[30:40] Peter on the day of Pentecost opened the
[30:42] door to the kingdom he did the kingdom
[30:43] had just been set up in Jerusalem the
[30:46] kingdom was set up on the day of
[30:47] Pentecost and when man wanted to know
[30:49] how to get into this kingdom Peter said
[30:51] repent every one of you be baptized in
[30:53] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[30:54] remission of your sins and you shall
[30:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[30:57] because that's what puts them into the
[30:59] kingdom
[31:06] that Adam Genesis 1:26 amen
[31:13] so in Genesis 1:26 man was that perfect
[31:20] kingdom when he turn a life in his soul
[31:23] that is what God is trying to bring us
[31:25] back to the track right because he
[31:29] turned a lot of people knew Bert's movie
[31:31] in your soul and brother Graham said
[31:36] this himself
[31:37] I don't have the quote but when you
[31:39] received the back to the molle goes the
[31:40] new birth
[31:41] that puts you back into that place
[31:43] Genesis 1:26 in your soul that's right
[31:45] that Adam women now this is before
[31:49] Genesis 2:7 when the flesh of man but
[31:51] evident became on Adam but remember the
[31:54] trashman of Adam was not was was was not
[31:58] was was corruptible it died it wasn't
[32:01] eternal but but but but that soul of
[32:06] Adams was eternal right and so when you
[32:09] received a new birth when your it takes
[32:12] you back to that Eden condition right
[32:15] yeah that Adam was in in that Genesis
[32:18] 1:26 because look what he said now we
[32:22] have to have it because here's the title
[32:23] of this yeah I'm getting home just going
[32:25] back and forth but the kingdom has to be
[32:27] established in early 1st then it can
[32:29] manifest out early and reign properly
[32:31] right Jess is 1 3 6 and God said let us
[32:37] make man in our image let us make man in
[32:41] our image after our likeness so then
[32:46] there's brother Brown good there's a lot
[32:49] of quotes for brother Branham supports
[32:50] that Adam was just as just as like God
[32:53] in that game at 1:26 man absolutely
[32:56] that was that was God Amon and what are
[32:59] you and me supposed to be a betrayal
[33:00] with God in flesh right here we've
[33:04] received a new birth in our soul it
[33:06] doesn't feel like it
[33:08] it doesn't feel like we got a flesh
[33:11] because our flesh certainly doesn't feel
[33:13] like it but we that's what God said
[33:15] about you and me Haven let us make man
[33:17] in our image after our likeness and let
[33:19] them have dominion over the fish of the
[33:21] sea and over the fowl in the air all
[33:22] right Adam have full dominion over all
[33:25] these things that's the reason why the
[33:26] creation is waiting for its travailing
[33:30] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[33:33] that's right we have the new birth we've
[33:36] got with the kingdom established
[33:38] inwardly but it's got to be manifested
[33:41] on the outside right and that's that's
[33:46] that's the heart that's what that's what
[33:49] we're scaling this right here this is
[33:51] for the this is for the external payment
[33:53] right but you can't you can't control
[33:57] this without having an inward leaf or a
[33:59] cut right see a kingdom a kingdom has
[34:03] them a physical Kingdom has to be an
[34:06] order physically inwardly first then
[34:10] they connect then it can produce
[34:13] outwardly order Amen right I don't know
[34:18] we can say the same thing about
[34:19] Washington DC but stop it but there has
[34:28] to really how things should be it has
[34:30] there has to be ordered inside first in
[34:33] order for there to be order outside
[34:34] that's right right you have to have
[34:37] dominion over your inward Kingdom first
[34:39] in order for there to be Dominion on the
[34:42] outside on your external key right but
[34:45] it all blends into one king that's right
[34:47] amen that's why you need these virtue
[34:49] and whoever said you don't need these is
[34:51] a liar doesn't understand that but as a
[34:54] half for the men you know that is in
[34:55] your kingdom that's right
[34:56] you need to the unique unique other
[34:59] otherwise brother Branham just wasted
[35:01] his time preaching a message about this
[35:03] that's right you need to have faith
[35:06] virtue knowledge temperance godliness
[35:07] but this isn't further to say
[35:10] could you burst starts down here heaven
[35:12] right and without the Holy Ghost without
[35:15] you being born again without lowly
[35:17] ghosts you can't produce godly virgin
[35:19] you can't produce godly knowledge and
[35:20] all these all these things right you
[35:23] need to have the baptism holy goats
[35:26] homos I just always wondered when it
[35:29] said that us man in our image
[35:32] that's for so is that the Father Son and
[35:36] the Holy Ghost in one is that what God
[35:39] was thinking when he said
[35:43] don't wait on the chance that's all it
[35:45] was
[35:46] yeah get on the topic we'll cover that
[35:50] later all right
[35:52] I mean Jesus is all three of them with
[36:11] absolute right and that's what then
[36:14] we'll look at something next next time
[36:16] overload they're pretty much the same
[36:18] thing okay yes that's the way we're
[36:19] looking at let's just read this real
[36:21] quick and I'll finish this in the smyrna
[36:22] churches truck unless we suffer with him
[36:25] we cannot Raymond in Detroit you have to
[36:27] suffer to rain it's it's tough
[36:30] struggling you know it's coming through
[36:32] this doctor today but it's worth it
[36:34] the reason for this is that character
[36:36] simply has never made without suffering
[36:38] character is a victory not a gift
[36:41] naima all right a man without character
[36:45] cane train because power
[36:47] apart from character is satanic exactly
[36:50] amen but power that kingdom power with
[36:54] character is fit to rule images and
[36:57] since he wants us to share even his
[36:59] throne on the same basis that he
[37:01] overcame and has sat down and his
[37:03] Father's throne then we have to overcome
[37:05] his right to sit with him amen y'all
[37:10] just chew on that with resolute mean
[37:11] Lord will and next Sunday we'll continue
[37:13] anybody have do we have to we have some
[37:17] time left or no three minutes you
[37:19] already have a question comment this is

[37:25] common baby
[37:30] appreciate our sister they have been
[37:32] with us I'll give you and yeah yes all
[37:36] right well let's all go ahead and go up
[37:41] [Music]
