Ephesians chapter four and then James chapter 5. and uh I want to look at something of I'd spoke I've spoke on this before and uh go along with uh what brother Wade breaks a little bit and uh brother Ryan's Sunday school lesson which I thought was really good I really really enjoyed that and uh something that brother Donnie said while he was up doing responsive reading and praying and I was like well Lord I just think that must be your confirmation for me to speak on this and because I'd already I'd looked at this and I'd preached on it before and I got to look on it and it just seemed like this is the way the Lord wanted us to go so y'all just pray for me tonight and we'll uh look at a few things tonight but uh let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author tonight before we look into the scripture our heavenly father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for this evening Lord that we're able to gather in your house bother together with those a black precious faith and Lord we're just so thankful Lord for all your blessings on us Lord that we can come and gather around your word and Lord we know that it's not just a dead letter Lord but it's it has life it has power and Lord we just want to glean everything that we can from it Lord we want to become that Living Word that the world can see not just something that people want to talk about or or look at but we want to be a living manifestation of the word and father we just pray you help us tonight Lord as we speak bless each one that is listening in Lord each one that's here we just commit everything into your hands Lord you just bless the hearer and the speaker tonight Lord and we just want to give you all the praise the honor and the glory Lord we want to give you the preeminence Lord you just help us this evening Lord and Lord let it not just be a gathering Lord but we want to hear from you tonight Lord and Lord we pray for each one that has a need Lord you know the the sick and The Afflicted Lord all the different needs the people have and the Lord we just commit them to you in the name of Jesus Christ Lord and we're just so thankful that we've seen you come on the scene so many times when it didn't look like there was a way Lord you made a way you know we're just we just realized that we can just put our trust in you our confidence in you Lord Lord why should we fear why should we worry Lord because that's not the spirit that we've been given in this hour Lord but we've given one a power and love and of a sound mind Lord and we just commit all things to you we thank you for we just want to say that we love you and we just praise your holy name and we just committed everything in your name in the name of Jesus Christ amen in Ephesians chapter 4 it begins verse 11. and it says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God I don't know I don't know where people get the idea that the fivefold Ministries job Runs Out uh you know as as long as nobody as long as everybody's not come to Unity of Faith we've got a job to do and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ so if we come to Unity of the faith and the knowledge the Son of God and it brings us into the stature of the fullness of Christ we got a job he said that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and be carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and Connie craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up that's where I want to speak from they grow up into him and all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love in James 5 verse 7 says be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband and waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter ring amen God bless you may be seated tonight and I just want to speak on this little thought about spiritual cultivation and I really enjoyed what brother Ryan had to say about you know all of our our relationships and everything there has to be work and it has to be there has to be cultivating of all these things and you know everything if you if you if it means something to you if it matters to you then you know it takes time it takes effort everything in life that big holes there's many people you know they're out to try to find a uh a quick way of getting something they want to get rich quick scheme and you know there's no such thing as that I mean if you if you want to develop into any kind of any kind of person any kind of skill it takes time you know everything you know to even even growing up you know because you know it there's an old saying that many people have and you know everybody they talk about pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and everybody thinks they're a self-made man well there was somebody that said one time he said well who who gave you the boots with the bootstraps so you had to have something somebody had to start you had to start somewhere you know you're just not a self-made man it takes I mean but you do have to put effort into it it takes something but you know what it takes you have to have some help to get there and I want to look at this word uh cultivate cultivation and also uh from from James here it talks about the husband and waited for the precious fruit the word cultivate means to Foster the growth of to improve my labor care or study to refine to free something from such as a metal sugar or oil from impurities or unwanted material to free from moral imperfection to elevate to improve or Perfect by pruning or polishing to further or to encourage now this is the word uh husbandman and husbandman says one whose Talent is to cultivate the ground and it says in the in the Old Testament here it says the word husbandman comes from the Hebrew word Adama which means land or of the earth which is the same Hebrew word from which we get the word Adam the name of the first man whom God placed in Eden to work and to care for it and then the scripture Genesis 2 15 it says and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it it says Jesus compared God to a husbandman in John 15 1-2 says I am the vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away in every branch that bearth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit so we know that in the in the scripture we know that um one of the in the you know in the Old Testament um the if you did not have a a religious job everybody that was everybody was was a husbandman everybody worked in the fields and everybody everybody had that kind of occupation everybody uh was of it worked in tilling the ground and taking care of all those things and um you know what everybody had to do all all of all those things so it was really a really an important ish a part of uh the lives of of the people in the old in the Old Testament and um you know a lot of the types and things we see in the Old Testament all come from from that kind of life and tilling the ground and all that and the Scripture it talks about the purging of the of the fruit as we was reading here in John and it says a good husbandman worketh the Earth he cultivates plants and naturally expects them to produce fruit commiserate with the amount of effort he has invested in them so when you put in the this amount of work you expect something out of it because if you're going to put in the work then you expect something to come out of it you know because like brother Wade spends a lot of time tilling the ground in in the early part of the you know May June April whatever it whatever months it is when he starts tilling the ground and getting everything ready well you know there's a lot of hours and a lot of labor involved in all of that because he's expecting something to come from all of that and so there either you put in all this and he says our heavenly father the Divine husband seeks to produce fruit through us as we abide in Christ so as we are in Christ then God has laid out a plan for us to bring forth much fruit just as the scripture says here he is the vine we are the branches and if we're the branches then we're the ones that are to Bear the fruit and he he is the husband and He is wanting us to be abide in Christ and then if he's if we're in Christ then we are a new creature then we are to bring forth the fruit of the work that God has done because it's no longer I that live it's no longer I doing the work but it's Christ doing the work in me and if he's doing the work then he is supposed to be manifested in us the work that he does is working through us that should be bringing forth this fruit and he said just as God is a good husband and bringeth forth fruitfulness in our lives we should be good husbandmen with the resources he has entrusted to us so this is a few things I want to I want to look at later on but kind of just laying a background here about understanding about this about cultivating and being a husband and understanding what what these things are and brother Brandon was speaking here in the message the end times seed sign Ed seed and he was talking about the Bible this is a quote number one brothers and and says he says I read in the Bible heavens and earth will pass away but God's word shall not pass away he said I read in the Bible that whatsoever and whosoever shall take anything out or add anything to it his part will be taken out of the book of life that stands just the way it is many try to say it's been tampered with it's been done this way or that way I do not believe that I believe there's got to be some kind of a standard that God will judge the church by or the world there's got to be some standard it cannot be in church organization because they different who would say who would know what to do but there is a standard and that's his word I believe that God wants watches over his word I believe that that word is punctuated exactly the way God wants it the Bible it's God's word to the people there's where the reason I believe in that word and I believe the word is a seed and if that seed is sowed in the right ground and watered by the Holy Spirit it'll bring forth of its kind any promise of God will do it and so you know I believe that you know I believe that God has a standard and this is God's standard and God wants us as brother Ryan was talking about you know getting into the word and studying the word and and becoming one with the word and study in the word and and getting into the word and meditating on the word and it becoming a part of you and you know every part it was really good to you know to hear brother Ryan talk about you know the issues that he had in his life the struggles that he had in his life when he got into the word of God and the word of God became a important part and it's become such a foundation of his life of everything he done was in the word that was that was his top post to come back to the word and it becomes such an important part of him then when he become because he had these struggles in his life but when the word becomes something that was important to him and more important than anything else it become because it became life to him then all of a sudden through that he was able to overcome the struggles that he had the problems and the and the things that he had to face in life that he was able to overcome it because you cannot overcome these things in your own your by in yourself you're not able to overcome these things but praise God he give us the word to overcome by amen and if we'll take him at his word then you know we can overcome see we have to trust God if we can trust him he says he says this is from Jehovah Jireh he says look old brother he said when that Holy Spirit come up into that vine and produce from oh I'm sorry I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself I'm sorry but uh what what I wanted to I was I was getting ready to read this and brother random speaking here and he's speaking of uh here in Jehovah Jireh this is where brother Brandon is actually speaking of going and seeing the tree I believe it was in Arizona he was in he went to go see the tree that the brother had and it had all of the citrus fruits in it and he sees this tree and he's fascinated by this tree and he sees all of these different all these different fruits living off the same life of this tree and he's sitting there and he's like well how is this possible that we can see all of this fruit growing on all these trees and all this fruit is thriving in this tree and he sees this and he's and he starts asking the brother about this and he was like because they're all citrus fruit they're living off the Citrus life and he said because and he was saying so will they bring forth oranges later on he's like no he said whatever that branch is that's what they're going to bring forth because that's the life that's tied to that tree he said they're still living off the same life but he said as long as that that branch is tied to that tree it'll grow whatever that branch is and he was saying so they had the lemons and the tangerines and everything else was growing and it was thriving it was wonderful but he was like but what how you know what will take place and that man told him the brother told him he said listen he said if it ever brings forth another Branch if it ever brings forth an original Branch from the tree then it will always bring forth oranges because it's an orange tree but you can tie into that you can you can be grafted in you can you can live off that life but it'll never be exactly what God created it to be and that's the reason you can't have you can you know have be tied in and that's the reason you you can have the life and you see things that that take place but it's not the original life it's not the plan of God but people have tied in denominations and and their own ideas into the end of the life of God and you see things take place but it's not original it's not correct and that's what brother Brandon was talking about he said see he said brother when that Holy Spirit come upon that vine It produced from its Vine we was talking about the bride tree the restoration of the broad tree and produced from its Vine to the very Branch he said they wrote a book of Acts behind it he said if that tree ever puts forth another original limb she'll grow the same thing it'll be Jesus Christ he said now we've got Methodist Presbyterian Baptist Lutheran such he said bearing denominational fruit because if we ever puts forth another Branch she'll be a genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of God he said remember and he said remember about preaching the message on the the bride tree he said how that the husbandman come forth and it was bearing the wrong kind of fruit so he cut it off cut it off kept cutting it back cutting it back but Joel said what the Palmer worm left the canker poeter eaten and what the caterpillar left something else eating we find out them insects it's the same insects only in a different stage and what the Lutheran left the method has eaten what the Methodist left the Baptist eating what the Baptist left the Pentecostal Eden he said the whole thing is cut down but God said I will restore saith the Lord all the years I will send back another church in the last days I will restore the original Power again in the evening time it'll be like down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches is pruned there will be there will come forth the Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah God promised it God will do it he said he would do it I will restore he says I will restore all the years that the denominations eat I will restore all the years I've pruned the thing off but yet there will come a vine out of the heart of it he'll be he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water a man that meditates in the word of God day and night not a Creed or a denomination but meditates in the word day and night he'll be like a tree that's planted by the river of water branches shall not wither he'll bring forth his fruit in this season God promised it so when he's speaking of what's taken place but we realize that we've had a message in our day that was a message of restoration and it was to bring back these things and that's what has come in our day we've received this message of restoration to bring back the fullness of the word that has been lost down Through the Ages and to bring us back and we have come to this place and we've come to this place of realizing who we are and what God has done for us that we have received the full word in our day that we have that it has been restored to us and all the things that that have been lost everything that has been confused on all these things God has restored to us and we can come back to the place where we can have the full word have the full assurance and and to know what God wants done with the word not what man has tried to take and and tried to uh tried to figure out on his own or anything like that but you know now we have thus saith the Lord we have what the true understanding the true revelation of the word is and so all these things have come that all of the denominational uh missteps and and all the confusion everything now has been gone away all these things have been taken away but the problem is is there's many people that have walked in in the word but the problem is is they've not walked in the full light of the word and you know they've walked in these things and because the light has has shown the light has increased and gotten greater but many people still walk in darkness and don't realize the day and the hour which we live when you begin to point people back to the word to show them that all the things all the confusion all the things that were wrong that were all through the All Through the Ages and when it came back to understand what the truth is people turn it down because they hold on to a denominational idea and what did Brother Madam say in the message the birth pains when he was talking about he said they want to sympathize with the word but they don't actually want to receive the word he said they want to sympathize with it but he said they don't want to take it they don't want to actually take it and rot away from their old denominational ideas and come to the message of the hour they don't want to take what the truth is even when people come to the place when you begin to show people what the truth is but you know I say brother Brandon was telling the story about the man and you know he was walking along the trail you know and he told Brother about him he said I don't agree with you on your Doctrine brother and you know brother random began to talk to him he was carrying that ladder and he said well how do you get home can you say you're home from here can you see the path do you know all the way he's like no but I've got a light this light that is shining in here is showing me step by step by step he said I know I've got a home there and all I got to do is walk step by step by step on that one on that path and it'll take me home he said well brother that's the way the word of God is he says you can't see it all but you got to start taking step by step by step if you will step if you just continue to walk in the light as God shows you the light you will continue to walk in the in the furtherance of the word but many times people have gotten to the place where they don't want to well I don't I don't know and you know and and they get into the place where they don't want to step out they don't want to stand on their own convictions they don't want to stand out and be be separate they don't want to they don't want to be an oddball they don't want to be and you know have to stand against the the all the things of the world why because people people just don't have a backbone sometimes they stand alone and stand for their own convictions and it's like you know people say well I you know I don't like to to be um people don't like to uh be where people don't like them but you know I'd rather I'd rather people hate me for who I am than people like me for for a phony version of me you know you know if you if you think I'm if I'm just an imitation if I'm just I'm just a fake then you know what nobody knows who you are because you know people you can put on and put on a good show for people but if it's not the truth if it's not who you are then you know what people don't even know who you are and really sometimes people get to the place where they don't even know who they are you know it's like like the old say it was a about the man and they you know it was a a preacher many years ago and they always talked about said when he was with the Oneness he was one this and when he was with the Tunis he was Tunis and when he was with the Trinity he was trinitarian and if you ever ask him how you baptized he said in water silly how else all you had to do was tell him what you wanted whatever you wanted him to preach and he could preach it I heard this man stand up and and he's told he's told multiple he's passed on now but he's told multiple people stood up and he said he believed that brother Bradham was Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 and I've heard him I sat in a detent meeting in his one of his meetings as a kid and heard the man stand up and say I didn't know the serpent had a seed and as a kid I I didn't know a whole lot but I understood exactly what he meant when he was why because when when people was paying the bills and everything like that he was not going to say that he believed brother Branham to be a prophet because whatever they but you know what when he got off by himself when it was one on one that people began to ask him questions and you know and they somebody asked him one time said why is it that you don't preach this message if you believe it if you've studied this message said why don't you preach this message he said that's for you younger men see people don't people want to want to have a meal ticket they want they want to do they just want to float along but you know what on the day of judgment you don't have anybody you have to give an account for yourself we have to give an account for I have to give an account from our myself we have to give an account for our own actions our own beliefs our own our own way of doing things everything that we've done we are we're responsible to that we're responsible in the way that we raise our children everything is responsible we're responsible to that so we have we have to lay out you know because sometimes it's it's not it's not easy to do what's right it's not fun to do what's right when raising when just like raising children you know you know we never want to believe when your parents tell you this is harder on me than it is on you you're lying until you become a parent and then you know what it breaks your heart sometimes it is it's because but you know you see when when you have the when you have this relationship and you begin to see this thing then you understand how God is you know as it was I believe brother Branham or brother Dale always said you know God chastises us with nail pierced hands you know how does how does God raise his children and how does he how does he look at things and many times I under I can honestly say I I'm not Christ's like because some sometimes that I get up and speak and unfortunately Dale Roberts is there like the older I get the more I see my dad I speak and sometimes it's like Dale Roberts I look in the mirror and I see Dale Roberts why because it's of the flesh and it's like well you know we we don't like to live that way but you know that's who we are and it's a battle you've got to overcome that and so you know many times you know we wish we wish we had just every time we'd open our mouth it would be the words of Christ we we would have the mind of Christ all the time and everything that we would say and everything that we would do would just be so christ-centered that we wouldn't have an issue but lots of times we don't do that Aaron Roberts shows up on the scene and then it was like Lord why did I say that why did I do that because that's the struggle and so we just continued to allow God to do the work in US and we realized every time we fail and we have faults and we have struggles realize you know we're not where we ought to be but praise God the Lord shows us in those times you need to Lean on Me you need to put your trust in me now it's time to move on from this are you happy where you're at no I'm not well what are you going to do about it well I don't want to do this again but that's what God does for us here in we read this earlier this is John chapter 15 verse 1. he says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman now this is from the message the restoration of the broad tree brother Brandon says see God is the good husbandman he pruned the tree that that was all cut off all the dead limbs he said what's he going to do burn them up up there exact God is the husbandman of the tree of this tree he takes care of it he watches over his heritage what is his Heritage his own word he watches over his word to confirm it to watch it see where it can get he's going to restore see when these churches begin to organize and things like that he just prunes them off and the church goes on and he said later on he says he is going to restore so we understand that God is the husbandman and one of the things I want to look at tonight about cultivating the um cultivating this the seed and the understanding about the husbandman you know uh God's talk you know brother Ram talks about God being the husbandman and he also talks about Christ being the husbandman and so there's and he also talks about the pastor being a husbandman and and different ones and so I just want to look at some of these things tonight but understand how God does the work and it continues on because the the scripture tells us that I didn't I didn't bring it but um he the scripture tells us you know that the ever the head of every man is Christ and the the head is over the wife and how all these things work together and so we see how this is to work together as it comes down and everybody has a place but you know many times people want to look at it as the scripture tells us you know um you know we're not to be Lords over God's heritage but we're supposed to be caretakers of God's Heritage and so you know when it when you look at God being a husbandman you know then he prunes and he takes care of this and you know he has care of what he's trying to do and and many times people like to try to think you know we're supposed to or even sometimes people has the mentality that the pastor is up here and he's just supposed to beat you over the head or or you know all these type of things and not realizing the strain and the pressure that the preachers go through that the ministers that the pastor goes through trying to labor in the word for the people and the care that it takes that because it's you know like brother Branham says you know many times he would get up and he's been you know he's cutting but you know it's not because he wants to be that way brother random strike but he's trying to convey the word of God and even sometimes you know he says you know I tried to pass you know try to pass around this sometimes but he said God kept bringing me back to this why because he was the voice to tell the people that you're veering off that you're off the word that you're not in the place that you're you should be and he's bringing the people back to show them where they ought to be and so he was trying to bring the people back to this place and here here brother Madam speaking of God being this good husbandman and he wants us to bring forth good fruit he wants us to bring forth more fruit and then he continues the parts for us to bring forth much fruit the scripture tells us so as we come through these things and he said the things that are not to be correct that he said he's there to prune all these things off so that we may grow back grow more to become more into the stature of him he said that we cut all these things off for uh for us to see how these things take place here is trimming all these things off and so when these things are taking place it's to it's to make us more into his image and many times we go through many things in our lives and we wonder why we don't understand or we we don't appreciate those things that that we have to go through the things that we have to face but you know we see these things are for our benefit they have a a great uh benefit to us the Heavenly uh Vision that's taking place of when God brings us all through these things how he brings us all through these and so he continues on here in in Hebrews chapter 2. brother Brian was speaking and he and he begins to talk about Redemption he says I wish we had more time right now he said I'd like to take you to that law of redemption he said but we haven't just but just for a moment he said a beautiful picture is in Ruth and Naomi he said if you'll see there the reconciliation how that the husbandman the man that was to redeem The Lost and the Fallen estate had to begin folks to the person that had lost the estate he said that's the reason Boaz had to be a Kinsman to Naomi that he could get Ruth then he had to be worthy and he talks about having to go through and make a testimony and to redeem them and this is from the breach brother Brown says see Boaz had to become a redeemer and he was the only one that could he had to be a Kinsman a near Kinsman and redeeming Naomi he got Ruth that was Jesus Boaz type in Christ and when he redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride so here here he is when he's talking about this reconciliation see they you know as as the scripture tells us and brother Brian tells us you know he didn't God didn't bring it Christ didn't bring us to an inheritance he brought us back to an inheritance that inheritance was already ours but there had to be reconciliation to bring us back into into the place where we needed to be because you know because the scripture tells us and brother I'm talking about the broad tree the bride tree was was ate down but there was a word that was given for them to be restored to bring back to cultivate the tree back to the place where it was to bring back the fullness of the tree for us to come back to the fullness of what God had in his mind of what the bride would be see down Through the Ages the bride was was a part of Christ but she never could she never could manifest the part that God wanted her to express she never could because the word was ate down but the word had to be restored so she could come back to the place where God wanted her to be and so there was a Reconciliation a word of reconciliation that had to come that she could be brought back to the place where she ought to be just just as Naomi and and Ruth there you know you know when Naomi had lost her family and she had went away but when she came back there had to be somebody there that was willing to redeem Naomi to bring her back into her possessions because you know what because the possession still belonged to Naomi those were still her possessions but the problem was there had to be somebody to do the work to do the act of reconciliation as a Kinsmen to do the work to bring her back to that place and when that when so when Boaz come to a place you know realizing he couldn't do the work when there was a near Kinsman who wouldn't do it he didn't want to do it but Boaz wanted to and he came and he done that and he done the work to bring Naomi back to the place where she ought to be bring what was hers back to us she came back in to possession of what actually belonged to her and so then then you know that he was able to get to get Ruth but see there was the one that had to bring us back to the place where we ought to be to bring us back into fullness of where we ought to be praise God because you know when you think of where you came from and where he came from to bring us back into because praise God when we come in this world lost and alienated from God and not who thought we had anything but praise God the word come to reckon to show us who we are and what belonged to us we're not second-class Citizens We're Not aliens but you know what we are children of the Living God and he came to bring us back into fellowship and bring us back into possession of what is ours did he come to bring us back to restore us see it's a wonderful thing to realize who you are I you know because many times the devil wants us to live so far below our Privileges and not realize Who We Are and take God at his word right but that's what God wants us to do he wants us to take a take a stand and realize what belongs to us hey stand up because if he's done he's done the work a Reconciliation if he's if he's paid the price if he's done if he's done the work and he's brought it back to you can you imagine that if if here here's Naomi who's been alienated and she she lost everything but it still belonged to her but then all of a sudden here's Boaz comes out and does the work of reconciliation of restoration and brings her back to the place and says listen Naomi all the things that you've lost belong to you again they're now in your possession and then Naomi's still living on the side of the road somewhere what if she was living in some in some Squall or somewhere and not realizing she had a place to go to she had a possession and yet she never took possession of it she had something that she could went on and then she had all of these goods and she had this land and all these other things that belonged to her and yet she never walked in it she never took possession of it she never claimed any of it well then what was the what was the work that Boaz done if you never take and possess the things that Boaz has given you if the work has been done and you never claim those things if he's brought it back to you and you and made you heir hey you're you're the heir of these things all the promises of God that are in the scripture they become ours but you know what if we don't take possession of them if we don't claim them then you know what what God has done is null and void but if we take these things and while and realize what God has brought back to us what God has given us and then we take these things and then we'll begin to walk in those things just just as the word of God has been planted in each one of us then guess what then God the holy spirit is here to grow for you to Quicken the word that you hold for you to grow by then if then if we if we lack something as as second Peter tells us about you know and we realize you know if we if we have these things that we're not Barren or unfruitful but you know we can grow by these things we have these are our possessions that we're able to grow then when when he's given when he's giving you the word and he and he brings the Holy Spirit which is to Quicken the word which is to water the word when he brings these things to you then when when he brings these things to you then if you don't grow then what's that whose problem is it so he's trying to cultivate why because he's a husbandman and what what does a husband been doing he is there working on that Bri on that tree and that he's beginning to cultivate and everything that you have need of he begins to work in your life everybody's different but whatever you have need if you start on this journey and he begins to lead you along that journey and he begins to bring out the things that you have on the inside that you bring forth the things that God has given you that you begin to manifest Jesus Christ why because everybody has a different thing that they've got to overcome but praise God whatever it is that you're old that you've got to overcome greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he's already given you these things to overcome by these things if you will just continue to feed on these things and grow by them but say to praise God when you realize you know he doesn't just plant something and as brother Wade was talking about the baby you know we just go stick it in the calls and expect it to grow up but you know it's the same thing about having a husbandman that's cultivating a a seed which is the word of God that when he is trying to grow this they say he's overseeing that word because that word is going to come to fruition whether you believe that or not he will why because God started a work in you how many how many times has God done something in your life and you begin to look at the things that you went through in your life and you don't think you'll overcome when you don't think you'll make it when you don't think you'll get an answer when you don't see a miracle and all of a sudden when you begin the word comes forth and he begins to speak to you in the middle of the night or from a preacher or wherever it is he begins to speak to you and all of a sudden you begin to see that your answer is already there and all of a sudden you begin to say the things that God starts working in your life even when you can't put it in your mind to understand what God's going to do he'll come on the scene and begin to work how many people can stay I mean how many times how many people can hear can stand up and say you know what I believed everything God said I expected all this to take place how many times have you heard things happen in your life and you're trying you're still trying to wrap your mind around it when you sit down and you think about the goodness of God and you begin to think about what God's done in your life and where you've come from and where you are today and still try to wrap your human mind your finite mind around what God's done for you to realize what God's done for you where you are today How Great Is Our God that he's brought us to this place see if we can if we realize what God has done for us God has done so many wonderful things in our life see if we begin to just take the things that God has said and see the works that God has done and see God God has already fulfilled these things we don't see that we can't even you know but that's what the scripture tells us in the mind of God it's already finished when he died on the cross he took stripes on his back and died on the cross and said it's finished when he said it was finished then you know what brother Bradham said if if Jesus was standing here right now in a suit in front of you he couldn't do any more than what he's already done for you you come and said Jesus heal me he said I can't he said I've already done it I've already healed you you are you've already come to that place now who's now who's who because he's already brought you the gift when you when you're seeking the Holy Ghost and you're out praying that the Lord coming you know one of these one of these days you know what you realize you know what that God begins to speak to you and you realize from the scripture that you know what it's already been given to you it's already a gift he's already given to you and one of these days we realize we realize if we die out to ourselves and we can receive it but the problem is is we want to hold on to Aaron Roberts we're still holding on to Bob black and in one of these days you know what we die out to ourselves well we get out of it we get out of our own way then God can do something and all of a sudden we realize you know I've got out of my way I got out of God's way and then we get to that place well praise God then God can do something God can show us what he's already given us my brother Brandon stood there and said he said do you realize that God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you wanted yourself you know how many times how many times do we stand there and we and we we were you know because we're we're we are so worked up about receiving the Holy Ghost we're so desirous and not realizing God wants to give it to us more than we wanted ourselves see it's a it's an amazing thing when we realize that why because God wants to give it to you and there comes a day when you realize that you that the Lord is coming to bring that to you there's a day that he's coming in to dwell in you we're we die out to ourselves and we can receive him but it takes a dying out to ourselves God honors our faith and he said he gives us the Holy Ghost there's a time we realize you know because we got faith in what he's doing we get out our we get out of our way we get out of his way see we understand these things that we God can bless us and everything else it's the same because it's the same one that led us on that started on our journey that found us wherever we were and some in in our confusion and our darkness and put us into a place that he brought us into the light and Justified us and Sanctified us and fill us with a holy ghost brought us all the way through and then all of a sudden we get to the place where we realize you know what we we have feel been filled with the Holy Ghost and been brought into the kingdom of Jesus Christ and we realize that we've come into the kingdom of God and we have a place we have standing with him when we see we understand who these things are and then then people will turn around and and what well I don't know if I can make it up the statue of a perfect man am I going to am I going to well because it's the same Journey it's the same Faith it's the same word that started you started on the journey with it's going to continue on the way see it's the same it's the same Journey Lord just help us get out of our way help us get out of your way see what what takes place what what do we what do we need because when we began to look here and and we talk about God being the husbandman and and Christ meant and we we see how Christ was the husbandman and you're realizing in the last day what that's the reason I read this scripture I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna close here in a minute but that's the reason why I read that scripture tonight Ephesians 4. why why did he why did he sin Apostles or prophets evangelists Pete teachers and pastors why were they sent why were they sent because they were sent to bring us to the place where we ought to come to he says Hey here in the scripture I want to read this he said for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ he said till we all come in the unity of the faith what we all have to be born again by the same faith we brought or brought into the body and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ so we all come to the place where God because every one of us has a place in the body of Christ everybody has their position in the body of Christ amen you know because sometimes people don't realize you know you've got a position you've got a place in the body of Christ you're part of the body and you know what you're important because you know what it don't it don't matter who it is or what important part of the body it is you're important because without you whether you think you're so insignificant and yet nobody will miss you but if you're part of the body of Christ you're significant because without you the body is not complete whether no matter whether you think how small or insignificant but you know what even though even the the parts of the body the scripture tells us you know what all the small parts even the uncommonly parts you know what they still have their comeliness they have their part and they have their position and they have their respect and their honor everybody everything has their position has their place and so as he was speaking What it Took the fivefold ministry the husbandman because there's no longer it's no longer I it's it's it's not me doing the work because I I honestly I would tell you I'm I'm I I'm a poor example of the of a minister well I didn't get any amen so that's good but that's the way you know because you know what you can't think any higher than you then you have to realize you know who you are I realize who I am I wake up with this guy every day I look at him in the mirror every day but you know what it wasn't for the grace of God you know what we we wouldn't be where we are today it's not because I realize my faults and failures nobody has to point them out I see them all the time I live with me I know who I am but praise God see it's it's not me because I you know I I you know I think man we've got some great ministers here and I I listen to them and I'm like man we got I mean it's like well I'll just take a back seat when you see those things but you realize God called you to do your part you can't you because you know we look if we look at ourselves we're insignificant we're inadequate but praise God it's not us it's God it's God doing the work but see it takes God and and so brother I'm talking about the the preachers the preachers and the pastors so the fivefold ministry is the husband and what are they trying to do they're trying to cultivate the word that people hold who you are they're trying to con cultivate that word they're trying to cultivate Jesus Christ in you and many times people say well you know that's just that's just brother Dale or that's just brother Wade or that's just brother Bob well you know sometimes we got to stop and think you know what we just need to say no we just need to be quiet because sometimes we don't realize sometimes because what is hindering us is our own thoughts and it's our own it's our own actions it's our own mouth we're we're hindering God because you're gonna say well you know maybe maybe somebody says something that we don't like something something is said that we thought that we take offense to it's like well you know what before you say anything or before you act a different way maybe what you need to do is pray about it we need to sit down and pray about it and say well Lord I don't want I don't want to be a hindrance because you know what as a body maybe I don't you know because you know we look at what brother Brandon said about hindering the church you know one person can can have a problem say You Hinder yourself but You Hinder everybody else when you when you overcome when you're strong when you uh when you do your part then you know what you're edifying the body but you know what when we fail when we don't do our part how small or insignificant we think but he was saying you know one little thing one person can do one thing and cause a church to fail we can hinder somebody from getting their healing we can hinder so many people and not realize it what was it when Aiken was out there in the in the in the in the battle well he saw just a few wedges of gold in a garment that Babylonian garment well it was just insignificant it was small nobody was ever going to miss any of that nobody was ever going to miss those those gold wedges and that garment look at all the stuff that was left no none of that was touched all that got destroyed we didn't mess with any of that had that one little bit and what was it just just that one little bit and how many men died was it 21 brother Bob will tell me but Bob's going I don't know but you know how many men lost their lives because they thought well that's insignificant and if we think well I'm part of this body and it's like well I don't do my part then you know you can hinder somebody else and sometimes the issues that we have is some people get in their mind a certain person is invaluable one person is expendable one person we can overlook and not realizing God doesn't look at them that way some of the some of the ones that are not here with us anymore and I'm not talking about the ones that have passed on I'm talking about the ones that are not in this building the one person I think of is Brother George you know when you think about people that are not here well you know what they have their value because God loves them God died for them and many times like well they're insignificant or whatever no they're not one person one young person that's left this church when you look at one child that's walked out of this church no matter what they do when they walk out of this church they're walking over a lot of prayers when they walked out that door and you know what each one of those children are worth ten thousand worlds all the money that Bill Gates and all of them ever all the money that Toyota has none of that means anything to One Soul they walk out this door they well you know I'm living my life I'm I'm living it up I'm doing good no you're not and I don't care where you go or what you do you walk out of this church the the token is still being applied to you and I don't care if nobody else prays for them I'll pray for them stand and belief for them because I believe God will because if I believe that God has called them and we have called for them and they'll come back man and I you know I ain't got to try to figure it out I know he'll take care of it so we have we have our job to do and we are to be ones that not to not to be as the scripture says not to be a lord over the people but to be a servant and I got a couple of scriptures here I want to read before I before I quit first Peter 5 1-5 says the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a part A partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feeding feed the flock of God which is among you being the oversight thereof not by constraint but being but willingly not for filthy Luke or but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that faith not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble and so that is that is our job and I appreciate the brothers here I appreciate brother Wade and his work and his labor and these other brothers I appreciate their and I I hope and pray that I get to the place where I'm willing an example of your ministry because we realize is God doing the work it's not us but God has placed these men in our lives to bring us to the place that we need to come to in the last scripture I want to read here tonight this is from First Corinthians chapter 3 by 5-8 and it says who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom we believed even as the lord gave to every man he says I've planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but God that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor so we all have our own part to do and as we see God has called us to this place and we are to help cultivate the body and each one of us have our own part to play but you know God called us to this place and if God has called us to be ministers to cultivate this he said you know Paul said I planted Apollos water but God gave the increase whatever one does and the other one comes behind it all five officers have to work together all five fold the five-fold ministry has to work together there's not one greater than the other it's all of us working together because God is the one that gives the increase the prophet came and brought us the word but he gave a Divine Commission for the ministers to pick this message up and to carry it on he said that there will be young men that will pick this message up and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord and I believe that if I believe that's what God has called us to but not not to be uh not to be someone that tries to be a lord over anybody or try to try to force people into something but to be an example to the Believers of what needs to take place amen well God bless you tonight let's all stand we'll have the musicians coming I want to sing that little song I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever I want
