[17:33] that was that was fantastic
[17:35] well this this afternoon I want to read
[17:37] from the Amos chapter 3.
[17:41] and we'll just take a take a little
[17:43] subject of are you on God's list
[17:50] let's just bow our hearts and our heads
[17:55] oh God we're so grateful to be able to
[17:57] gather around once more around your word
[17:59] and we just ask your blessing Lord Lord
[18:01] we we certainly we've got the letters
[18:03] here on the page Lord but Lord we need
[18:05] we need you to open the book and give us
[18:07] the true essence of it and Quicken it to
[18:10] our hearts and our lives Lord
[18:12] to give us the true meaning of these
[18:14] things that we read about Lord what
[18:16] would service be without your spirit
[18:18] moving Among Us Lord and we just invite
[18:19] you now Lord to Lord to be present with
[18:22] us and to help us Lord and to make this
[18:24] service a real Church worship service
[18:26] where we can have Liberty with you Lord
[18:29] God
[18:30] Lord you've given us something to
[18:31] worship about you've given us a true
[18:34] revelation of what these things are that
[18:35] we read about
[18:37] we just ask your blessing now on your
[18:39] word and your name amen
[18:44] so we'll read in Amos chapter 3 verse 1
[18:46] to 8. it says hear this word that the
[18:50] Lord has spoken against you o children
[18:52] of Israel against the whole family which
[18:55] I brought up from the land of Egypt
[18:57] saying you only have unknown of all the
[19:00] families of the earth therefore I will
[19:02] punish you for all your iniquities
[19:05] can two walk together except they be
[19:07] agreed
[19:08] will a lion roar in the forest when he
[19:10] has no prey while a young lion crowd up
[19:12] his den if he have nothing if he has
[19:13] taken nothing
[19:15] can a bird fall in a snare upon the
[19:17] Earth where no gen is for him shall one
[19:19] take up a snare from the earth and have
[19:20] taken nothing at all
[19:22] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[19:24] the people not be afraid
[19:25] shall there be evil in this city and the
[19:28] Lord hath not done it
[19:30] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[19:33] he revealeth his secret unto his
[19:35] servants the prophets
[19:36] the lion hath roared who will not fear
[19:39] the lord God has spoken who can but
[19:42] prophesy you may be seated the Lord at
[19:44] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[19:49] now if you don't know who Amos was I'm
[19:52] gonna go ahead and take my shackles off
[19:55] if you don't know who Amos was Amos was
[19:57] a prophet that
[19:59] he said he actually said I I'm not a
[20:02] prophet or a son of a prophet and that's
[20:05] kind of a strange thing for a prophet to
[20:06] say but he said he made that statement
[20:08] because he wanted to make sure that
[20:09] everybody knew that he didn't go to the
[20:11] schools or the prophets he wasn't he
[20:13] wasn't like a professional Prophet that
[20:15] got paid to say the right thing to
[20:16] people and I I just thank God that
[20:19] there's true God called people that will
[20:21] tell the truth it doesn't matter whether
[20:22] they get paid money for it or not money
[20:24] or whether they uh whether whether this
[20:27] or that whether they're popular or not
[20:28] popular you think this scripture this
[20:30] verse verse 8 the lion at the world who
[20:33] will not fear the lord goth has spoken
[20:34] but who can but prophesy
[20:36] and brother Brandon would use this to
[20:38] kind of uh nail the nail people's eyes
[20:41] to the wall when he preached that
[20:42] message
[20:44] spiritual Amnesia he was he was a nail
[20:47] in everybody's hide to the wall there in
[20:49] Birmingham Alabama
[20:50] as he was exposing their doubt and their
[20:54] disbelief I think thank God that we've
[20:56] we've got a prophet in this last day
[20:59] uh you know brother Brown would uh he
[21:02] would explain over and over that
[21:04] ministers were so confused and then God
[21:07] gave a sin a prophet and you know we we
[21:09] take that people take that around the
[21:11] land sometimes and they'll take it as
[21:12] well ministers are just confused period
[21:15] well that's why we needed a prophet to
[21:17] come because when you have a prophet
[21:19] then that removes the confusion and
[21:22] thank God that we've got a profit
[21:24] because now we've got something to
[21:25] preach it's taken away our confusion
[21:28] that now we know what we believe
[21:30] and you see all these things that that
[21:32] Amos was was uh another thing about Amos
[21:35] he he was put out of the northern
[21:37] kingdom they they didn't like his
[21:38] preaching so they just put him out and
[21:40] Amos got into the rather odd position
[21:42] that he instead of being able to preach
[21:44] he had to write and so if you heard what
[21:47] Amos preached you would hear it by by
[21:50] maybe somebody reading one of his his
[21:51] messages or you uh you reading it
[21:54] yourself
[21:55] so uh thank God for the message that you
[21:59] can read and and get into your for
[22:01] yourself
[22:02] and and amos's position was he he right
[22:05] there at the time of the great
[22:06] prosperity in Samaria he was preaching
[22:09] at a time where Israel had gotten so
[22:11] where they got so much money and so much
[22:13] they just got real soft and they had
[22:16] everything that they needed and they
[22:18] started getting away from God
[22:20] this was during a time of the great
[22:22] prosperity in Samaria Israel had
[22:24] prospered is what brother Adam said and
[22:26] he would go on to say he'd say not
[22:27] always Prosperity is a sign of spiritual
[22:30] blessings but sometimes on the contrary
[22:33] now you go back and study out all the
[22:36] things that brother Branham would say
[22:37] about prosperity and he really didn't
[22:38] have that much good to say about
[22:40] Prosperity whenever whenever you know we
[22:43] know that the love of money and the root
[22:45] is the root of all evil and there's
[22:46] nothing wrong with having money or
[22:48] saving for your retirement and those
[22:50] kind of things but but you watch just
[22:52] it's pretty consistent as soon as
[22:54] Prosperity comes somebody starts getting
[22:56] prosperous it will brother Brandon would
[22:59] even make this statement he said
[23:00] Prosperity always ruins people and
[23:04] that's a hard thing to say he would say
[23:05] but but Prosperity takes a man away from
[23:08] God and you think even just looking
[23:10] around and observing that you can see
[23:12] the effect that Prosperity has it has
[23:14] has had on this layout a second age that
[23:16] we're living in that because we have a
[23:18] lot of money now now our kids don't go
[23:20] play in the dirt like they used to now
[23:22] they go play with an iPad used to we'd
[23:24] play in the yard until our mom would
[23:26] tell us to go play outside until the
[23:28] street lights come on and we'd run
[23:29] around with our friends and act like
[23:31] good the good kind of hoodlums and until
[23:34] the street lights came on
[23:36] and but now now that I remember playing
[23:39] with the dirt because I didn't have any
[23:41] I didn't have any you know nice toys or
[23:43] anything just scooting around little
[23:44] rocks and stuff in the in the dirt but
[23:46] now what do we do we babysit our kids
[23:48] with iPads and and iPhones and they get
[23:50] to watching stuff that they shouldn't be
[23:52] watching and and you don't know you
[23:55] don't know what they're saying on Tick
[23:56] Tock or or or Instagram or whatever
[23:59] because they're messaging your friends
[24:00] and you gotta you gotta spend so much
[24:02] time staying on top of that and it's
[24:04] impossible how are you gonna how are you
[24:05] gonna observe everything that they do
[24:07] sneaking around so you see what
[24:09] Prosperity does prosperity will take you
[24:11] further and further away from God and
[24:14] brother Brown would say another thing he
[24:15] would say we forget God when Prosperity
[24:18] comes because you you start getting real
[24:20] soft and lacks what you oh you should oh
[24:23] you start giving your kids great big old
[24:25] gifts and stuff and until they get to
[24:26] the point where they think that that
[24:28] life owes them a favor and you oh you
[24:30] see but because you've got so much money
[24:32] you could you have the luxury to be able
[24:34] to just give them a great big nice car
[24:36] when they go enough or just give them a
[24:38] great just everything they need a new
[24:40] suit so you give them that they need
[24:41] everything they need they need and they
[24:43] start depending well life just owes me a
[24:45] favor one day I'm going to need a job
[24:47] and well somebody's gonna have to give
[24:49] me a job but that that ain't that that
[24:50] ain't the case is it but because you've
[24:53] got money and because you've got
[24:54] Prosperity you begin to depend upon your
[24:57] own self and your own Works instead of
[24:59] dependent upon God
[25:01] that's one thing we noticed when we were
[25:03] down in Nicaragua they didn't have any
[25:05] money they got to depend on God they
[25:07] can't they don't have no uh uh Health
[25:09] Plan where they can go to the doctor and
[25:11] say well they'll just pay for whatever
[25:12] dude experiment all you want do whatever
[25:14] but no they got to depend on God for
[25:17] what they have need of and that's what
[25:19] they affect their prosperity oh that's
[25:21] what Amos was preaching at he was
[25:22] preaching that a day much like ours when
[25:24] people had got so prosperous that they
[25:26] had everything they wanted they had oh
[25:28] today you look around in the parking lot
[25:30] and everybody's got a nice car I'm not
[25:33] preaching on you by the way
[25:39] but it's just a sign of the times it's a
[25:42] sign of the times that we've got we've
[25:44] got I mean I got a nice car too that's
[25:45] that we oh we're all in the same boat
[25:47] here we've got we got nice things but
[25:50] brother random said God doesn't promise
[25:52] ease and prosperity but he promises
[25:54] Grace to endure in every trial uh my
[25:57] wife and I were listening to a preacher
[25:59] the other day and he was talking about
[26:00] how that if you really have confidence
[26:02] in God that God will give you money and
[26:04] prosperity and I will say what what
[26:06] there is no promise there's no promise
[26:08] in the Bible of prosperity we're not
[26:10] Prosperity preachers you you can't
[26:12] there's no promise of that look what
[26:14] brother Brown was saying you can't have
[26:15] you there's no there's no confidence
[26:17] that God will give you a lot of money
[26:18] but he will give you Grace to endure
[26:21] every tribe Now isn't that what the Rich
[26:23] Young ruler's problem was he had all
[26:26] this money and he was unwilling to even
[26:27] give up a little bit so that he could
[26:29] get what really mattered in life eternal
[26:31] life he he was he was unwilling to to
[26:35] sell all he had and start and give to
[26:37] the poor because his wealth his what he
[26:40] had in this life was worth more and
[26:41] that's what Prosperity does
[26:44] brother Brown will say Amos we don't
[26:45] have any history where it come from we
[26:47] know he accorded the scripture here he's
[26:49] a herdsman he was a heard he was a fig
[26:50] tree farmer and he was a cattle farmer
[26:52] and that's why he said I I'm not a
[26:55] prophet and I'm not a son of the prophet
[26:57] he was a nobody that God plucked out of
[26:59] nowhere isn't that just how God does
[27:01] what I'm talking about tonight is being
[27:03] able to identify you're in the scripture
[27:05] yourself in the scripture and when we
[27:07] read these stories you can put your own
[27:08] self in the scripture and say I you know
[27:11] what I I lived through that I was a
[27:13] nobody and God what am I doing now come
[27:16] on I'm a preach on myself a little bit
[27:18] what am I doing up behind the pulpit how
[27:20] did I get here I was a nobody I I if
[27:23] y'all could go back into my life and
[27:24] remember when I started coming to this
[27:25] church and you know the people poking at
[27:27] me and all that kind of stuff I I'm
[27:29] nothing I'm I'm nobody but and yet
[27:31] that's how God does everybody he'll take
[27:33] somebody that ain't nothing like David
[27:35] and take somebody like Amos or whatever
[27:37] and and and and and and and give them a
[27:40] life experience so they can share it
[27:42] with others and be an influencer others
[27:45] and and brother Brown would say on one
[27:47] hot day in Samaria there the one of the
[27:49] great tourist cities of the world at
[27:50] that day he wasn't looking at what
[27:53] tourists usually see oh isn't that how
[27:55] we do when we go to like a Beach town or
[27:58] we go to Florida or somewhere we go to
[28:00] Pigeon Forge or whatever the tourist is
[28:02] going to be looking for some
[28:03] entertainment a little place to go a
[28:05] nice place to go eat or nice place to go
[28:07] eat or a a place to go get some good
[28:10] entertainment maybe go on a little zip
[28:11] line or walk on some kind of bridge that
[28:14] goes over the mountain or something like
[28:16] that but that wasn't what Amos was
[28:17] interested in he got up there oh if you
[28:20] could look at Pigeon Forge like Amos was
[28:22] looking at it if you could look at
[28:23] Myrtle Beach like Amos was looking at it
[28:26] Amos would look at those things like
[28:28] like a prophet would look at it he was
[28:31] looking at the morality the moral of
[28:34] Decay the situation that Prosperity had
[28:37] caused yeah they had a lot of they had a
[28:39] lot of wealth and things oh but you go
[28:41] with Myrtle Beach and you go to any
[28:42] Beach town you go to any place any place
[28:44] like that and look at the the condition
[28:46] that the world has got in he said he
[28:49] found them so decayed and so morally
[28:51] corrupted he said everything that God
[28:54] had expected out of him they had went
[28:56] right the other way now now we go to
[28:58] Myrtle Beach and I'm not I'm not
[29:00] preaching on Myrtle Beach I'm just I'm
[29:02] flying off the cuff but we go off to
[29:04] those places
[29:05] and and we're looking at you know
[29:07] worldly people and everything but Amos
[29:09] was looking at people that were supposed
[29:10] to be Believers now there's where the
[29:13] problem is you know I think one of the
[29:15] one of the worst things to look at is
[29:17] not an unbeliever it's somebody that's a
[29:20] make-believer a good Fair a Pharisee is
[29:22] one of the worst things that's talked
[29:24] about in the Bibles I'm a Christian and
[29:26] yet you're living a moral horrible
[29:28] looking life and a shame and a reproach
[29:31] to the to what Christianity stands for
[29:33] that's what Amos was looking at you're
[29:34] supposed to be better than this you're
[29:36] supposed to be you're supposed to be an
[29:38] example to the world you're supposed to
[29:40] be oh today you're supposed to be Christ
[29:42] on display and to look at what
[29:44] Prosperity has caused what the
[29:46] corruption that has set in and you know
[29:48] moral Decay if you look online it says
[29:51] moral decay occurs when they accepted
[29:53] Norms of right and wrong virtue and vice
[29:56] begin to erode or weaken over time
[29:58] leading to a decline in ethical Behavior
[30:01] and a breakdown of moral Integrity in
[30:04] other words you just turned into just
[30:05] horribleness just a stew of iniquity and
[30:08] filth and and brother Brown would say he
[30:10] said we're not supposed to act like the
[30:13] rest of the people we are different we
[30:16] are a different character oh I thank God
[30:19] that God's given us by the power of the
[30:21] Holy Ghost the ability to change that's
[30:23] what that's what the the message the
[30:25] Paradox that I was preaching Wednesday
[30:26] night up there in in South Carolina
[30:29] God God wants to change us he wants to
[30:32] make you different he wants to make you
[30:34] holy like himself and he's given us the
[30:36] recipe for that his word his word will
[30:39] go out and grab you and begin to pull
[30:40] you into himself and begin to change
[30:42] your life because God oh he just won't
[30:45] settle for you being the same as the
[30:46] world he won't settle for it you know
[30:49] you see out on as you drive by different
[30:51] churches they got their signs out they
[30:53] say just come as you are well that's
[30:54] fine you come as you are you of course
[30:56] we got different standards that you
[30:58] can't just come in here like they do
[30:59] over at Lake Lanier and come in your
[31:01] baby
[31:02] you can't do that but listen when you
[31:06] come when you come you won't remain as
[31:08] you are something's going to change
[31:10] either you'll get worse or you'll get
[31:11] better because the word is going to have
[31:13] an effect in your life
[31:15] and when you come to the house of God
[31:17] when you come and you stay God requires
[31:20] Holiness God requires Holiness from the
[31:23] front to the Back The Minister's got to
[31:24] be holy the people have to be holy
[31:26] everybody's got to be holy or the thing
[31:28] won't work right
[31:29] now listen this will be a little bit
[31:30] scalding for me to read these quotes but
[31:32] here it comes so wake up Rouse yourself
[31:34] don't get don't don't get droopy eyes
[31:36] this fast we're only 10 minutes in hang
[31:38] in there with me and Jehovah Jireh he
[31:41] said God did one thing after he chose
[31:43] Abraham he called for separation and
[31:46] that's one thing God does when he calls
[31:48] any man or woman separate yourself from
[31:50] the world get out from among your
[31:52] Kindred he said to Abraham and I'll
[31:54] bless you and if you'll notice he never
[31:56] did bless Abraham until he separated
[31:57] himself from all of his Kindred lot and
[32:00] all oh that so that means if you want to
[32:03] be blessed if you want to receive a
[32:04] blessing from God you got to separate
[32:06] yourself oh now you start off in your
[32:09] journey separating just a little bit but
[32:10] then God starts carving things off and
[32:13] as long as you'll stay under subjection
[32:14] to the word he'll separate you more and
[32:16] more and more until you're till you're
[32:18] just complete complete Oneness with God
[32:20] and fully separated from the world but
[32:23] you got to be separated you can't be you
[32:26] can't be flirting around with the world
[32:27] on one hand and well I wish this I wish
[32:30] that I could just take a little toddy
[32:31] every now and then I wish I could dress
[32:33] like them I wish you like it I could go
[32:35] just enjoy and I swim at the beach or
[32:38] something when my in my Skippy clothes
[32:40] listen I'm talking about that God will
[32:42] change your desire so you don't want to
[32:44] do those things anymore
[32:47] I I I I thank God that by the by The
[32:50] Prophet's message and by what we're
[32:51] reading here in the Bible that we've got
[32:52] the ability to preach a message of
[32:53] Holiness God wants us to be holy that's
[32:56] what that's what that little baby form
[32:57] sanctification is to take that unclean
[32:59] Spirit out of your soul so that you'll
[33:01] have the right kind of Desire that God
[33:03] can fill you with his faith so that you
[33:05] can be positioned to believe but then
[33:07] God continues that work of
[33:09] sanctification on your in your life as
[33:10] you begin to move up that statue of
[33:12] perfect man and then even even when
[33:14] you're capped even in adoption God
[33:16] continues the sanctification because
[33:18] he's got a completely separate you from
[33:21] everything of the world completely
[33:23] separate what are you talking about
[33:25] brother Bob I'm talking about when Jesus
[33:26] was there crying out in the Garden of
[33:28] Gethsemane should I should I separate
[33:30] from my will my will Lord not let thy
[33:35] will be done not my will and you got to
[33:37] be separated from that you got to be
[33:39] separated from your own will and the
[33:42] Ephesian Church age brother said the way
[33:44] of God is Holiness let this be known to
[33:47] every member here of the body of Christ
[33:49] until you live a holy life God refuses
[33:54] your sacrifice
[33:56] so you think coming here this morning
[33:58] this afternoon that if you want to be
[34:00] acceptable to God you got to be you got
[34:02] to be Sanctified you've got to be purged
[34:04] you've got to be purified so you might
[34:06] as well just let God have his work in
[34:08] you because without that you'll never be
[34:10] acceptable to God the sacrifice must be
[34:13] holy with holy hands and First
[34:15] Corinthians oh Paul really laid it out
[34:17] to the Corinthians as he was trying to
[34:19] straighten things up all the Corinthians
[34:21] needed some sanctifying all right they
[34:23] had all kinds of problems when Paul got
[34:24] to them but Paul would lay it out he
[34:26] said Purge out therefore the old living
[34:28] all everything from your wrong Doctrine
[34:31] to your wrong idea your own the wrong
[34:33] living Purge it all out that you may be
[34:35] a new lump as you are unleavened for
[34:37] even Christ Our Passover is sacrifice
[34:39] for us and he said for but now I have
[34:42] written unto you not to keep company if
[34:45] there's somebody in your company that is
[34:47] living in fornication living in adultery
[34:49] somebody that's railing against their
[34:51] wife this that can't hardly keep from
[34:52] having a conversation with their wife
[34:54] without busting a hole in the wall
[34:56] somebody that's covering us they're
[34:57] always going around trying to look at
[34:59] everybody else's cars and talking about
[35:00] how they can get that and cover he said
[35:03] don't even eat with that person listen
[35:05] to what Paul said he said but now I have
[35:07] I have written unto you not to keep
[35:08] Company If any man that has called a
[35:10] brother be a fornicator or Covetous or
[35:12] an idolater or a or a drunkard or
[35:14] an extortioner with such and one know
[35:17] not to eat
[35:18] now Paul's not saying he said if you go
[35:20] read First Corinthians chapter five he's
[35:22] not saying that that we shouldn't be a
[35:24] witness to people in the world but he's
[35:26] saying when somebody comes into the
[35:27] house of God and they begin to confess
[35:29] and profess that they are a Christian
[35:30] but yet they won't live a holy life you
[35:33] cannot you cannot endorse that oh see
[35:36] isn't that what the devil wants to do
[35:38] the devil wants to find an endorsement
[35:40] that's why the devil will always come to
[35:41] a minister or somebody can you can you
[35:43] bless my life can you bless the way that
[35:45] I'm living but Paul was saying I cannot
[35:47] endorse Unholy living there ain't no way
[35:50] according to the Bible to endorse Unholy
[35:52] living
[35:53] and Paul brother Brown said this old
[35:55] little old fella Amos coming up over the
[35:57] hill was coming to tell them thus saith
[36:00] the Lord clean this thing up or you're
[36:02] going into captivity oh you got to live
[36:04] a clean life you got to live a clean
[36:06] life or when you come into the house of
[36:07] God you'll be uncomfortable because you
[36:09] get preached on it's going to be
[36:10] preached on I'm preaching on tonight if
[36:12] there's anything that you're
[36:13] uncomfortable with then clean it up
[36:15] clean it up and then it won't be
[36:16] preached to clean it up and then you
[36:18] won't feel uncomfortable when you come
[36:19] into the house of the God because we got
[36:21] to line up with the word we got to be
[36:23] separated from anything that's off the
[36:25] word and line up exactly until we're
[36:27] living a holy life a life that Amos
[36:30] wouldn't be ashamed to look at
[36:32] and again what I'm talking about tonight
[36:34] is identification what do you identified
[36:37] with when I preach these things are you
[36:39] identified with a holy life or are you
[36:42] identified with a life of moral Decay
[36:45] and filth what kind of a life are you
[36:47] identified with when you hear the
[36:49] preaching of the Gospel does something
[36:50] well up on the inside and say that's oh
[36:52] I believe that that's the truth and I'm
[36:54] identified with that or do something
[36:56] maybe rile up and say well I don't like
[36:57] him for telling me telling me the truth
[36:59] something rile up with it oh you see The
[37:02] more I've gone around preaching lately
[37:04] the more it's become real to me that
[37:06] ministers should not care about the
[37:08] reaction of the people it's got to be
[37:10] laid out the weather is whether you like
[37:12] it or not it's got to be laid out
[37:14] because it'll do you good one way or
[37:16] another it might be scalding but it'll
[37:17] help it might help you get to the altar
[37:20] it might help you give yours give your
[37:22] life to God it might help you die a
[37:25] little bit
[37:27] which is what brother Wade told me
[37:29] before I come out he said kill us
[37:30] because we need to die we got to die for
[37:33] ourselves now you go online and you look
[37:35] at all these symptoms of moral decay
[37:38] I'ma read all these symptoms in more
[37:39] Decay but they're attributes and
[37:41] attributes are all a symptom of sin if
[37:44] you roll it all up it's the umbrella of
[37:45] sin when you disbelieve it will cause an
[37:48] effect the reason why you ain't living a
[37:51] holy life the reason why you can't you
[37:52] can't do it is because you disbelieve so
[37:55] you see the answer though is it believe
[37:57] if you believe God's word then it'll fix
[37:59] your condo it'll fix the way that you
[38:01] it'll begin to affect a change in your
[38:02] life now symptoms of moral Decay are a
[38:05] shift away from ethical principles and
[38:07] values that God individuals and
[38:09] societies and making moral decisions
[38:11] people won't even people won't even be
[38:12] able to live with their spouse if you're
[38:15] not if you're an immoral person before
[38:17] long the devil will start putting in a
[38:18] wife or a husband's mind well maybe I
[38:21] just I missed out years ago when I when
[38:24] I I missed out on a lot of fun I want to
[38:26] go experiment and have a little fun come
[38:28] on don't be looking at me weird this is
[38:29] how the devil this is this is how the
[38:31] devil does he'll put it he'll put
[38:32] something in your mind and and before
[38:34] that's a symptom of prosperity the
[38:37] effect that prosperity he has on people
[38:39] the moral decay of people's minds a
[38:42] decrease in virtuous traits such as
[38:44] honesty Integrity compassion and empathy
[38:47] arise in behaviors that are considered
[38:49] unethical such as lying cheating
[38:50] stealing and exploiting others that's
[38:52] what a Christian is not going to lie and
[38:54] steal and cheat because because you're a
[38:56] Believer and a Believer believing the
[38:58] word will have an effect in your life it
[39:00] will come out it will it will work its
[39:02] way out
[39:03] a lack of respect weakening of Family
[39:06] Ties acceptance of behaviors that may
[39:09] cause cause harm to oneself or others a
[39:12] decrease in personal and Collective
[39:14] accountability you'll say well I'm not
[39:16] accountable for my own actions if
[39:17] somebody else's fault isn't that what
[39:19] the moral Decay you start blaming
[39:20] somebody else I want somebody else is
[39:22] responsible for what's happening in my
[39:24] family I'ma blame the ministry I'm gonna
[39:26] blame maybe my grandparents I'll blame
[39:27] my parents somebody else and that's a
[39:29] symptom of moral Decay when you won't be
[39:31] accountable for your own action and
[39:33] brother man I'm gonna say what is sin
[39:35] friend those all those things are not
[39:37] sin those are attributes of sin sin is
[39:40] when you disbelief and your disbelief
[39:42] will cause an attribute it'll cause
[39:44] something to be manifested in your life
[39:46] what is sin friend smoking cigarettes is
[39:49] not sin drinking whiskey is not sin
[39:51] committing adultery is not sin that's
[39:54] the attributes of sin he that believeth
[39:56] not is condemned already unbelief is sin
[39:59] is that right you do those things
[40:01] because you don't want leave
[40:04] he's saying another place there's only
[40:06] one sin that's unbelief
[40:10] any man
[40:12] if he he lives as holy and Pious now
[40:14] listen how he worded this he any man if
[40:16] he lives as holy and Pious and as good
[40:18] as he could be that's why I so often
[40:20] preach against goody two shoes I'm
[40:22] against Goody Two we're not
[40:24] preaching a goody two-shoes message
[40:26] and yet say that the day of Miracles is
[40:29] passed and deny the scripture saying
[40:31] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[40:33] and forever that man is a sinner because
[40:37] he's an unbeliever
[40:39] so when you disbelieve God's word that
[40:42] makes you a sin now now a lot of this
[40:44] this might be a kind of background for a
[40:46] lot of this but you know I love to hear
[40:48] something preach that I believe in so
[40:50] y'all don't draw up on me when I'm
[40:51] preaching something you might have heard
[40:52] a thousand times encourage encourage the
[40:55] preaching so that maybe somebody that
[40:56] ain't heard it like you have maybe they
[40:58] can get a blessing you really pull on
[41:00] the word you know sometimes sometimes
[41:03] I'm not going to go
[41:07] and brothers said well before we had any
[41:09] sin we had no sickness after sin came
[41:12] then sickness was the attributes of sin
[41:14] and Amos what was Amos doing Dr Amos was
[41:17] down there diagnosing the situation and
[41:20] he could see what the problem was the
[41:22] prosperity and the moral Decay had
[41:23] caused a condition where they wasn't
[41:25] living right because they wasn't
[41:26] believing right he said Amos found them
[41:28] with a bad case of a disease spiritual
[41:30] Amnesia and that's just exactly what we
[41:33] got today he said the diagnosis proves
[41:36] what it is when people get away from God
[41:38] and won't listen to the word have no
[41:40] more desire for the word then there is
[41:42] one diagnosis to it the soul that
[41:45] sinneth that Soul shall die listen to
[41:47] what he said and won't listen to the
[41:49] word and have no more desire for the
[41:52] word
[41:52] now just going around to different
[41:54] churches I think that's the worst
[41:55] predicament that you can just about get
[41:57] into is where you sit in a church and
[41:59] you just don't care anymore you're
[42:00] sitting in church and you're there
[42:02] you're there but you just don't really
[42:03] care anymore when you have no more
[42:05] desire for the world oh God Deliver Us
[42:07] from predicament like that I don't ever
[42:09] want to get to where I'm cold and drawn
[42:11] up and don't don't want to don't want to
[42:13] say Amen in church and just don't want
[42:14] to care anymore if there's anything that
[42:16] I want to do I want to at least care I
[42:18] care about my soul I care about your
[42:20] soul I care and I believe God cares too
[42:22] and brother brothers said he knew what
[42:25] the disease was when he seen the disease
[42:27] of sin in the city what the what the
[42:30] disease was is they were not able to
[42:32] identify themselves
[42:35] now when you can't identify yourself in
[42:38] other words who am I
[42:41] where where did I come from who are my
[42:44] parents what am I like what is your
[42:47] identification they were unable to
[42:49] identify themselves now he called that
[42:52] spiritual Amnesia now come on now that's
[42:55] that's what I'm preaching on this
[42:56] afternoon is spiritual Amnesia and
[42:58] Amnesia it was when somebody doesn't
[43:00] know who they are now brother Brown
[43:03] would lay out for us all these ways that
[43:05] you can get spiritual Amnesia and he'd
[43:07] say one of them is shocked like a like a
[43:10] a military Soldier going overseas and
[43:12] you know many of us maybe even in this
[43:14] church might be acquainted with somebody
[43:15] that went overseas and they saw maybe a
[43:17] lot of children dying or a horrible
[43:20] thing horrible and and you just get into
[43:21] a State of Shock if you've ever seen one
[43:23] of those pictures of a World War II
[43:25] fighter that that got Shell Shocked they
[43:27] were in the trenches and they just come
[43:28] out and they all they were doing was
[43:30] staring and they wouldn't blink or
[43:31] nothing they couldn't even interact with
[43:33] somebody because they'd seen such
[43:34] horrible things
[43:35] and I began to meditate on this what
[43:37] what was brother Branham talking about
[43:39] when he said that spiritual Amnesia
[43:41] could come from shock and I I put on my
[43:43] headsets and I was I was going out
[43:45] listening to a book in the yard and I
[43:47] was listening to the book hard cases
[43:48] which is a book about
[43:50] um hard spiritual cases that that
[43:53] Christian counselors have dealt with by
[43:55] quoting the scripture and that book
[43:57] makes a case I'm not trying to promote a
[44:00] book or nothing maybe I shouldn't even
[44:01] mention the title because somebody get
[44:02] the wrong idea or something but
[44:05] that book is promoting the idea it's
[44:07] against the idea that that we need
[44:09] Psychology or drugs to help with
[44:12] situations all we need is the Bible and
[44:14] the Bible is sufficient in itself to
[44:17] help whether somebody's dealt with
[44:18] horrible sexual trauma been abused as a
[44:21] child whether they're dealing with with
[44:22] uh uh
[44:24] wanting to kill themselves or anything
[44:27] and they were relaying in this book all
[44:30] these cases and one of the cases that it
[44:32] kind of started off with was this case
[44:34] of this young woman that had just been
[44:35] through some horrible things and what
[44:37] happened was she went from counselor to
[44:39] council he's supposed to be Christian
[44:40] counselors and they were giving her
[44:42] drugs and counselor and all these things
[44:44] and it was it turned if I could just
[44:46] relate to you it was absolutely terrible
[44:48] the things that they had subjected this
[44:50] girl to because they didn't believe and
[44:52] the sufficiency of the scripture to
[44:54] counsel somebody in a situation like
[44:56] that and in one case they even they they
[44:58] diagnosed her with multiple personality
[45:00] disorder and one of the doctors that is
[45:02] supposed to be a Christian counselor he
[45:04] started he wanted to bring out each of
[45:06] her personalities and have a have a
[45:08] discussion with each of those
[45:09] personalities and interview it and you
[45:12] think oh just so many other things that
[45:13] left her so scarred by the end of it and
[45:16] I think what what what shocks people
[45:18] what scars people is things like that
[45:21] wrong doctrine that people have been
[45:23] left with as they go from church to
[45:25] church and place to place strange
[45:27] Doctrine and mistreatment and abuse
[45:29] traumatic events lead to shock inability
[45:32] to cope a lack of support oh but when
[45:34] you get with the real truth to what the
[45:36] gospel is about oh when that when that
[45:38] girl when that girl in this story was
[45:40] when they when they shared with her the
[45:42] real essence of what the gospel is about
[45:44] that your sins have been washed away
[45:46] that God don't hold you guilty if you've
[45:48] repented and begin to lay it out for her
[45:50] then then she got the real help that she
[45:52] needed and that's that's why we're
[45:54] preaching tonight that's what we're
[45:55] preaching today and every time we come
[45:57] to church we're preaching a gospel that
[45:59] is intended to help you because we
[46:01] believe in the sufficiency of scripture
[46:02] what am I talking about tonight this
[46:06] afternoon I'm I'm preaching about being
[46:07] able to identify yourself with the word
[46:10] and when you can't identify yourself
[46:12] with the word then you forget who you
[46:14] are and where you come from another
[46:16] thing that'll cause it is worry
[46:18] when you when you don't believe the word
[46:20] of God and you you not resting it the
[46:23] Bible says cast all your cares upon on
[46:25] him and when you fail to do that and you
[46:27] start taking it upon yourself you start
[46:29] worrying worrying will cause you to go
[46:31] into a place where you just you don't
[46:32] realize who you are you're unable to
[46:34] identify yourself with the Bible brother
[46:36] Brown said worry will cause it worry has
[46:39] no virtue to it at all someone said well
[46:41] now what if you're going to be shot in
[46:43] the morning wouldn't you worry I said no
[46:45] don't think so why I said worry couldn't
[46:48] do nothing but make me worse well what
[46:50] good is it going to do to have faith
[46:53] I said it might deliver me
[46:56] oh if we could if we could have that
[46:58] kind of an attitude when we get into a
[46:59] fix at work or a fix with our home and
[47:02] if you worry we'll not do it will not
[47:04] solve any problems it will not do
[47:06] anything but Faith might deliver you
[47:10] in Isaiah chapter 41 God told us through
[47:13] the prophet fear not for I am with you
[47:15] be not dismayed for I am your God I will
[47:18] strengthen you I will help you I will
[47:19] uphold you with my righteous right hand
[47:21] now that's a scripture that we can
[47:22] that'll give us confidence in the hour
[47:25] of worry to Cast Away our worry and just
[47:28] believe in First Peter 5 7 he said
[47:30] casting all your care or anxieties cast
[47:33] all your anxieties on him because he
[47:36] cares for you and Luke chapter 12 says
[47:38] which of you by being anxious can add a
[47:40] single being worrisome could add a
[47:43] single hour to your span of Life what
[47:45] good is being worried gonna do if then
[47:48] you aren't able to do a small thing as
[47:50] that why are you worried about the rest
[47:52] why are you anxious about that
[47:54] he said worry follow sin when you don't
[47:58] believe you start worrying worry follow
[48:00] sin did you ever notice what a horrible
[48:03] thing worry is there's not one value in
[48:06] it at all and he said the human heart
[48:09] was made to be happy worry will cause
[48:12] cancer
[48:13] because your heart was made to be
[48:15] peaceful and content to be joyous to be
[48:19] happy continue oh I think that's one of
[48:21] the greatest blessings that God can give
[48:22] somebody is just to be content whether
[48:24] you've got a cardboard box to sleep on
[48:26] where you got a mansion around you be
[48:28] content with whatever God gives you
[48:29] because worry causes cancer temper will
[48:32] cause cancer don't never be upset just
[48:35] walk in love
[48:37] Martin Luther said pray and let God
[48:40] worry
[48:44] Charles Spurgeon said anxiety does not
[48:46] empty tomorrow of its sorrows
[48:48] but only empties today of a strength
[48:53] Dietrich Bonhoeffer said worry is always
[48:55] a sign that you're trusting God has
[48:56] shifted to trust in your own strength
[49:00] and Thomason kind of said
[49:01] anxiety is the greatest evil that can
[49:04] befall a soul except sin
[49:06] all right
[49:08] that's why in Philippians chapter 4 it
[49:10] says be careful for nothing
[49:12] but in everything by prayer and
[49:14] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[49:16] requests be made known unto God
[49:18] and the peace of God which passes all
[49:20] passeth all understanding shall keep
[49:23] your hearts and Minds through Christ
[49:25] Jesus
[49:26] in Matthew chapter 6 said take therefore
[49:28] no thought for tomorrow
[49:30] for the moral shall take thought for the
[49:32] things of itself
[49:33] sufficient under the day is the evil
[49:35] thereof so don't worry about it put it
[49:38] in God's hands God will take care of it
[49:40] aren't you glad you've got a God that
[49:43] can take care of things that you're
[49:44] worried about or you're stewing about
[49:46] that keep you up at night oh now I think
[49:49] that's one of the remedies when your
[49:51] remedies for insomnia when you're laying
[49:53] awake at night and all these problems
[49:55] are rolling through your head just get
[49:56] on your knees for a little bit and throw
[49:58] it on God's shoulders and you'll find
[50:00] that weight lifted you'll find yourself
[50:02] all cleaned up when you rise up and
[50:04] everything's taken care of and you can
[50:05] rest the worries been taken away you can
[50:08] rest knowing that it's in God's hands
[50:11] and now that's really what faith is
[50:13] sometimes you know people want they get
[50:15] all wound up trying to work things out
[50:17] how do I know who to marry how do I know
[50:19] where to live how do I know what church
[50:21] to go with but faith faith if you really
[50:23] know what faith is Faith rests in
[50:25] knowing that God will take care of it if
[50:28] I know that there's a promise in the
[50:31] Bible that the spirit of truth will lead
[50:33] and guide me into all truth then I can
[50:35] have confidence that he's going to take
[50:37] me from point A to point B that's what
[50:39] faith is I I believe that he's going to
[50:41] do that how do I know because he said it
[50:43] and that's what my faith is resting in
[50:45] not in my worry not in my not in looking
[50:49] back at all these shockful events of
[50:51] things saying hurtful things and
[50:53] ministers that are saying things that
[50:54] are off off the word and looking around
[50:56] at all the circumstances and things but
[50:58] just resting solely in God's word
[51:00] because that's where I get my
[51:02] identification from
[51:04] oh when you when you hear the gospel
[51:06] preach like that something begins to
[51:08] Echo in your heart and you begin to
[51:09] recognize I I identify with that I
[51:12] identify that's what I'm preaching about
[51:14] this afternoon
[51:15] brother Brown said another thing that
[51:16] will cause you to get amnesia is getting
[51:18] between two opinions where you don't
[51:20] know what to do see it's it's because
[51:22] you're getting away from faith you don't
[51:24] have confidence in what God's word says
[51:26] so you don't know what to do do I stay
[51:28] home and listen to tapes or do I come to
[51:30] church what do I do do I do I need to do
[51:33] I need to listen to sit under a Ministry
[51:35] do I need to wear a dress in a certain
[51:38] way according to First Corinthians uh
[51:40] First Corinthians 11 do I need to change
[51:42] the way that I dress do I need to change
[51:44] do I need to put on some clothes when I
[51:46] go to the ocean do I do I need to change
[51:48] things oh when you don't know though
[51:50] that's getting between two opinions God
[51:52] wants you to know and have confidence in
[51:54] the direction that your life is going in
[51:56] in First Kings chapter 19 Elijah came
[51:59] unto all the people and said how long
[52:00] haunt you between between two opinions
[52:02] if the Lord be God follow him if the
[52:05] Lord be God follow him but if bailed and
[52:07] follow him which one are you going to do
[52:09] there's the choice that's been presented
[52:10] to every one of us which way are you
[52:12] going to cast your vote are you going to
[52:13] cast your vote for God are you going to
[52:15] cast your vote for the devil and the
[52:17] people answered him not a word isn't
[52:19] that a shocker the people just looked at
[52:21] him sometimes like how people look when
[52:24] you're preaching the gospel they just
[52:25] look
[52:28] I'm not I'm not trying to be nasty y'all
[52:30] y'all know what I mean
[52:33] foreign
[52:36] verse 6 he said he said he that wavereth
[52:39] is like a wave of the sea driven with
[52:41] the wind and tossed a double-minded man
[52:44] as unstable in all his ways a
[52:47] double-minded man is a man who is always
[52:49] trying to be on both sides at once he's
[52:51] sitting on top of the fence he's he's
[52:53] not really committed either way he's
[52:54] he's wanting to say he's a Christian and
[52:57] come to church but when he goes home he
[52:59] maybe he'll flirt around with the world
[53:01] or do some stuff with some girl that he
[53:03] ain't supposed to be doing sitting right
[53:04] on the fence not not fully committed
[53:06] either way a divided heart loses Both
[53:09] Worlds the one above and the one below
[53:11] is what another Theologian said a
[53:13] divided heart loses both were if you're
[53:14] divided you don't know which way to go
[53:15] and the power of decision brother Brown
[53:17] said if a man once anchors his heart
[53:19] against the heart of Calvary all devils
[53:22] in hell will never Shake him no more
[53:23] he's there
[53:25] notice for he that cannot stand
[53:27] chastisement is an illegitimate child
[53:29] that's what we're reading this morning
[53:30] he claims God to be his father when he's
[53:33] not just tossed about by every wind of
[53:35] Doctrine not stable and don't know where
[53:37] you're going double-minded and a lot of
[53:39] times double tongued and don't know
[53:41] where you're standing or what you're
[53:42] talking about then a man that's born
[53:45] again of the spirit of God knows exactly
[53:48] where he's at
[53:50] now if you're in a place where if you
[53:52] can identify with those things I'm
[53:53] talking about that of a double-minded
[53:55] person now wouldn't you want to be
[53:57] identified with a place where you can
[53:59] know what you're talking about and be
[54:01] identified with the word of God and have
[54:02] that kind of peace that when you go into
[54:04] bed at night you're not worried about
[54:05] your Eternal destination brother Adam
[54:07] said that's right nothing faces him
[54:09] because something inside of him has
[54:11] already witnessed somebody outside the
[54:14] cloud younger and by faith he sees him
[54:17] now we've got to be identified
[54:20] we're going to be either identified with
[54:22] the moral Decay and the symptoms of sin
[54:24] or we're going to be identified with the
[54:27] word of God
[54:29] Brother Bear must say we're identified
[54:31] with our families in this human life by
[54:33] marriage
[54:34] we are identified with our wives we
[54:36] marry and our families identified by the
[54:38] union of our marriage that means when my
[54:40] wife married me she took my name and now
[54:42] she's identified by my name you're
[54:44] identified by your family when my my
[54:46] kids and you know I I've got three girls
[54:48] but until they get married they're
[54:50] identified by my name and they know who
[54:52] their daddy is because they carry my
[54:54] name and my son carries my name because
[54:56] he's identified with me he come forth
[54:58] from me but brother Brown said what if
[54:59] you couldn't remember what if you got to
[55:01] a place where you just couldn't remember
[55:03] your spouse or your family or your
[55:05] children you couldn't remember oh come
[55:07] on now go with me we're not talking
[55:09] about things of the natural we're
[55:10] talking about do you do you recognize
[55:12] that you come from your daddy above do
[55:14] you reckon do you know where you come
[55:15] from
[55:16] he said when you get this Amnesia you
[55:19] might get like dipped Nebuchadnezzar was
[55:20] who exalted himself one time and God let
[55:22] him think he was an animal but you know
[55:24] you can be identified with an animal
[55:26] like Nebuchadnezzar but what separates
[55:28] an animal from a from a man and a man a
[55:31] human being has a soul that identifies
[55:33] you you know you're a human that you
[55:36] ain't some animal because there's
[55:37] something down on the inside that get
[55:39] that pricks you when you do wrong
[55:41] something that gives you've got a thirst
[55:43] that's thirsting after something
[55:44] thirsting that can only be that Holy
[55:47] thirst that can only be quenched by the
[55:49] word of God so maybe this afternoon if
[55:51] you've got that thirst that's pulling at
[55:53] you there's oh won't you just won't you
[55:55] just come to the Fountain and be drink
[55:58] from that water of everlasting life the
[56:00] brother said you got something down
[56:02] inside a conscience that tells you
[56:04] what's right and wrong the
[56:06] Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten that he was
[56:08] a human being he thought he was an
[56:09] animal
[56:10] so he acted like an animal Now isn't
[56:12] that how a lot of people at these
[56:13] vacation spots do they don't know that
[56:16] they got a soul and they need a God and
[56:18] so what they do is they just act like an
[56:20] animal they got their biker week and
[56:22] everything where they're acting like an
[56:23] animals they got all that they got all
[56:25] their the way that they dress and the
[56:27] way that they act they're acting like
[56:28] animals oh but let God get a hold of you
[56:30] and he'll cause you to realize that you
[56:32] ain't an animal that you're you're a son
[56:35] or a daughter of God and a son or
[56:38] daughter of God is going to act like
[56:39] their daddy
[56:41] you know my children they can't help I
[56:43] can't help but just like brother Aaron
[56:45] was talking about this morning you can't
[56:46] help but display the attributes of your
[56:48] father and even in the natural in in the
[56:51] natural my children can't help but in
[56:53] some degree you act like act like me you
[56:55] know we've got some of my wife's genes
[56:56] in there too but you know they're gonna
[56:58] like my son looks like me you can tell
[57:00] he's mine because he he's my child
[57:04] and we forget sometimes what the
[57:06] Christian church is brother rum will say
[57:08] we act like the world that shows that we
[57:10] got spiritual amnesia because that you
[57:13] don't act like the Christian you act
[57:15] like the world you receive the heart of
[57:17] the world and it causes this how's a
[57:20] Christian supposed to act we're supposed
[57:21] to love one another love one another as
[57:23] I have loved you Jesus said we're
[57:25] supposed to tell the truth is what
[57:26] Proverbs 12 22 says tell the truth a
[57:28] Christian is going to tell the truth in
[57:30] Matthew 6 14 we're going to forgive one
[57:32] another forgive them in their trespasses
[57:34] that's our Christian acts see when you
[57:36] forget those things oh but if you if
[57:37] you're doing those things and you see
[57:39] that manifested in your life you can
[57:40] identify with the scripture that's what
[57:42] I'm talking about you know where you
[57:44] come from when you identify yourself in
[57:46] the scripture and lowliness of mind let
[57:48] us esteem each other better than
[57:50] themselves oh when you can look at your
[57:52] brother and say I want more for him that
[57:54] I want for myself I want him to have the
[57:56] better place at the table I want him to
[57:57] have the better food the better cut of
[57:59] steak I want him to have the better
[58:01] everything you put your brother before
[58:02] you I want to get down on my knees and
[58:04] wash his feet because I'm putting
[58:06] everybody else ahead of me and that's
[58:07] what a real Christian Life
[58:09] and Colossians 3 12 a Christian what's a
[58:12] Christian a real Christian is just sum
[58:14] it all up it's going to be good because
[58:16] it says put on therefore as the elect of
[58:18] God holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[58:20] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[58:23] long-suffering forbearing one another
[58:25] and forgiving one another If any man
[58:28] have a quarrel against any even as
[58:30] Christ forgave you so also do ye
[58:33] and Israel had exposed got exposed to
[58:35] the world and had fell into this room
[58:39] brother and will say that Israel was
[58:41] like there in Ezekiel chapter 16 it
[58:44] relates to story of of how there was
[58:46] like a little girl that was in her blood
[58:48] and just a mess that God found on the
[58:51] side of the road and pulled up put in
[58:53] the palace cleaned up uh give everything
[58:56] that she had need of and that was what
[58:57] Israel was like
[58:59] and yet she turned around and just
[59:01] because she had all this Prosperity she
[59:04] forgot oh God don't want us to forget
[59:06] you get into a place where you got a
[59:09] cushy massage chair and a nice nice big
[59:11] weighted blanket and a nice little
[59:13] heating pad at home and you start
[59:15] forgetting things oh some that's what we
[59:17] were talking about sometimes God will
[59:19] get you put you through a little place
[59:20] where to uh squeeze you a little bit so
[59:23] that you remember remember where you
[59:25] come from
[59:26] and brother Adam said God by his grace
[59:28] chose Israel from all the rest of the
[59:30] families on the earth Grace had did that
[59:32] he had given him the choice lands he
[59:34] gave them houses that they never had to
[59:35] build he gave them Farms that they never
[59:37] bought he gave them he gave them food
[59:39] that they never planted he gave them
[59:40] Wells that they never dug he gave them
[59:42] victories that they never won he gave
[59:43] them Grace that had never married
[59:45] merited and after God showed all these
[59:48] mercies to her and she got rich
[59:50] she got amnesia and she forgot all about
[59:53] where these things come from
[59:55] well you ever just get along with God
[59:57] just begin to thank him for everything
[59:58] you know sometimes it just occurs to me
[1:00:00] that everything I've got and everything
[1:00:01] I am I didn't I wouldn't be nowhere
[1:00:04] without God
[1:00:05] I owe God everything
[1:00:07] oh in my job I owe and my wife I want my
[1:00:10] family oh I'm peace in my homo in my
[1:00:13] church that I go to everything that I am
[1:00:14] over my Ministry ever ever been an
[1:00:17] influence I ever have with anybody I owe
[1:00:18] him that because it's all due to him and
[1:00:20] nothing that I've done
[1:00:23] he said think about his grace to us of
[1:00:26] all that God has given to us all the
[1:00:28] blessing has blessed with like that song
[1:00:30] that brother everyone was singing this
[1:00:31] morning think about all the good things
[1:00:32] that God has done to us and he said
[1:00:35] that's a picture of USC and we'll say
[1:00:37] 2023 he was preaching back in 1964 but
[1:00:40] 2023 is still is suffering with the same
[1:00:43] disease
[1:00:45] people that can't identify themselves
[1:00:48] right they forgot his Holiness they
[1:00:51] forgot his law they forgot to be
[1:00:52] separated they forgot their morals
[1:00:56] oh if you forgot this morning this
[1:00:57] afternoon it's not morning this
[1:00:59] afternoon if you forgot let this be your
[1:01:02] reminder God is jaw on you he's calling
[1:01:04] you how is he calling by his word he's
[1:01:07] cold can't you hear you think about that
[1:01:09] statement can you have you heard from
[1:01:10] your theophany what's your theophany the
[1:01:12] theophany is your word that one word
[1:01:14] body that we're all part of and when you
[1:01:17] hear from your theophany it's the word
[1:01:19] being preached preached from that
[1:01:21] Genesis 1 26 27 to you that's calling
[1:01:24] you and drawing you and identifying you
[1:01:26] back to himself and when you hear the
[1:01:28] word and you receive it it quickens
[1:01:30] within you and identifies you back to
[1:01:32] that thought that God had before the
[1:01:33] foundation of the world though there's
[1:01:35] your identification when you begin to
[1:01:37] hear from you hear I'll say it like this
[1:01:39] let it not stumble you've heard from
[1:01:41] your theophany you've heard from that
[1:01:42] word that thought that God had from
[1:01:44] before the foundation of the world and
[1:01:46] it echoed within your heart and now
[1:01:47] where once you were identified with a
[1:01:49] moral Decay and sin of the world all
[1:01:51] those lists that Paul has all that
[1:01:53] messed upness like like Ezekiel talk
[1:01:55] about that little girl on the side of
[1:01:57] the road laying there in her blood you
[1:01:59] used to be identified with that but now
[1:02:01] you're identified with something else
[1:02:02] you've heard from you've heard from
[1:02:05] where you come from
[1:02:07] oh think about brother brother Brown
[1:02:09] told that story of
[1:02:10] I I looked it up so it's not nameless
[1:02:13] his name was Abdul Ibrahim IBN sorry and
[1:02:17] he was a he was a slave that got sold
[1:02:19] into slavery in about 1865 but really
[1:02:22] they called him Prince because when they
[1:02:24] found out that he was really the child
[1:02:26] of a king that they called him as long
[1:02:28] as he was a slave over here they called
[1:02:30] him Prince everywhere he went and he
[1:02:32] knew how to work that cotton gin and he
[1:02:34] was so good at it that somebody came to
[1:02:36] buy him and these this is the details of
[1:02:38] that story that brother likes to tell
[1:02:40] that that that somebody said I want that
[1:02:43] slave and he said I you you can't have
[1:02:45] him as good as he works as good as he
[1:02:48] knows the equipment that I have you
[1:02:50] can't he doesn't work like any other
[1:02:51] slave I'm not selling this man Abdul
[1:02:54] Ibrahim even sorry and brother-in would
[1:02:57] say one day I learned that over in the
[1:02:58] Homeland where he come from his father
[1:03:00] is the king of the whole tribe which is
[1:03:02] true this is a true story friends and
[1:03:05] though he'd be an alien and away from
[1:03:07] home yet he knows he's the son of a king
[1:03:09] and he conducts himself like the son of
[1:03:10] a king why because he was identified he
[1:03:13] knew where he come from just like a real
[1:03:15] born again Christian a real Thoroughbred
[1:03:17] Christian knows where they come from
[1:03:19] because they've been identified with the
[1:03:21] word
[1:03:22] he said what ought it to do to a
[1:03:24] Christian that's born again a man or a
[1:03:26] woman that our father is the king of
[1:03:27] glory in heaven we should have conduct
[1:03:29] ourselves as Christian men and women we
[1:03:31] should act like it dressed like it talk
[1:03:34] like it live like it now when it really
[1:03:36] strikes you what he's saying here it'll
[1:03:38] make you pick your head up and spring a
[1:03:40] little bit it'll make a preacher that's
[1:03:42] maybe down-hearted preach a little bit
[1:03:44] different it'll make things it'll make
[1:03:46] things ring a little bit differently
[1:03:48] when it really strikes you what he's
[1:03:50] talking about he said one time Israel
[1:03:52] when they started wanted to have a king
[1:03:54] over it because they forgot that God was
[1:03:56] their King that that little slave Abdul
[1:03:59] knew that he had a father over the
[1:04:01] Homeland and he knew who his daddy was
[1:04:02] but Israel forgot that they already had
[1:04:05] a king so they wanted God they wanted a
[1:04:07] replacement for that Samuel said did I
[1:04:10] ever beg you for my food and money your
[1:04:12] money too for me to live on no you
[1:04:14] hadn't done that you never told us
[1:04:15] nothing Samuel but what come to pass and
[1:04:17] you never asked us for our money for
[1:04:18] your living but yet we want the king
[1:04:21] anyhow they forgot not who their daddy
[1:04:23] was they forgot where they come from oh
[1:04:26] they forgot what their inheritance was
[1:04:28] and brother Adam said when the world and
[1:04:30] the church joins itself together then
[1:04:32] they don't want nothing spiritual they
[1:04:35] don't want the saith the Lord they won't
[1:04:38] they won't I want to think about that
[1:04:40] but they don't want nothing spiritual
[1:04:42] there's that not caring anymore
[1:04:45] I I don't ever want to get to a place
[1:04:47] where I don't care don't ever get to a
[1:04:49] place where you're not coming to church
[1:04:50] expecting to see something spiritual
[1:04:53] expecting to see God move don't ever get
[1:04:56] to an old cold former place where you
[1:04:58] don't expect to see God move down the
[1:05:01] aisles and the pillar of fire on display
[1:05:03] in the hearts of lives of people oh
[1:05:06] brother remember said they didn't want
[1:05:07] God's prophets no more what does that
[1:05:09] amount to they didn't want the word
[1:05:11] anymore because the God's Prophet is
[1:05:13] synonymous with the word what is the
[1:05:15] prophet a prophet is somebody with a
[1:05:17] gift to get themselves totally out of
[1:05:20] the way whether their dream realm and
[1:05:22] their natural realm is so tied together
[1:05:23] where they can just dream a vision while
[1:05:25] they're awake and they can get
[1:05:26] themselves out of the way where God can
[1:05:27] express his word right through them and
[1:05:30] speak to them so it's not when you say I
[1:05:32] don't want a prophet of God you're
[1:05:33] saying I don't want the word he said
[1:05:35] that's what this spiritual Amnesia does
[1:05:37] it makes people get to a spot to where
[1:05:39] they have no feeling on the inside of
[1:05:41] them
[1:05:42] they don't want nothing that's spiritual
[1:05:47] but you must be identified
[1:05:49] somewhere
[1:05:51] you must show
[1:05:52] that's what this is it's got to be once
[1:05:55] you go into the holy of holies
[1:05:57] you got to come back out to to put it on
[1:06:00] display to share it with other people
[1:06:01] you go into the holy of holy city you
[1:06:03] don't stay in there you put it on
[1:06:06] display
[1:06:07] now you can forgive somebody now you can
[1:06:10] love somebody you can love your spouse
[1:06:12] now it's on display
[1:06:14] James said show me thy faith show me
[1:06:17] that Faith that's why faith is at the
[1:06:19] bottom because this is the faith of God
[1:06:22] in Galatians that said I don't live by
[1:06:25] the by the I live by the faith of the
[1:06:27] Son of God faith and now now show me
[1:06:30] your works now you got faith put it on
[1:06:33] display in Matthew chapter 5 verse 16 he
[1:06:36] said let your light so shine before men
[1:06:38] that they may see your good works and
[1:06:41] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:06:43] so the question is where does your life
[1:06:46] identify you where does your faith
[1:06:48] identify you
[1:06:49] what are you
[1:06:52] what are you that's the question that we
[1:06:54] can ask on the way home maybe laying in
[1:06:56] bed tonight as you look up at the
[1:06:57] ceiling how do I know that I'm a
[1:07:00] Christian because my identification will
[1:07:03] identify me do you do you know who you
[1:07:05] are
[1:07:06] brother man will say you are identified
[1:07:08] either in Christ or out of Christ
[1:07:11] you're not halfway
[1:07:13] there's no such thing as a drunk sober
[1:07:16] man there's no black white bird you're
[1:07:18] either saved or you're not saved you're
[1:07:20] a saint or a sinner one way or the other
[1:07:21] and your spiritual attitude towards God
[1:07:23] Work God's word
[1:07:25] identifies you exactly where you're
[1:07:27] standing so how are you identified your
[1:07:30] attitude towards the word now your
[1:07:33] attitude ain't just like not in your
[1:07:34] head but your attitude is by Revelation
[1:07:36] you look at the word and it goes back
[1:07:38] that you can see your own life
[1:07:40] experiences the things that you have
[1:07:42] been through went through you can see
[1:07:44] the things your own Journey reflected
[1:07:46] back as you identify yourself in
[1:07:48] scripture with these stories that you're
[1:07:50] reading about and brother around would
[1:07:51] say to be American I must be identified
[1:07:54] with my nation when I am born here in
[1:07:56] this country I become a citizen and I'm
[1:07:58] identified with this nation all it is I
[1:08:00] am I must be part of let's speak think
[1:08:02] spiritual now all of its shame think
[1:08:04] about Christ on the cross now because
[1:08:06] that's where he's leading to all of his
[1:08:08] shame anything whatever you're
[1:08:10] identified with you're identified with
[1:08:11] the whole thing so come on now follow me
[1:08:14] to the point when I'm identified with
[1:08:16] the word I'm identifying with the whole
[1:08:18] word so I can't look at the Bible and
[1:08:20] say well I believe in this but I don't
[1:08:21] believe that you got to be identify with
[1:08:23] the whole thing and if you've got if you
[1:08:25] got a part of the word if you've got the
[1:08:27] word of God just a little bit by the new
[1:08:29] birth you've got access to the whole
[1:08:31] thing
[1:08:34] but around will say to be an American I
[1:08:36] landed on Plymouth Rock with the
[1:08:37] forefathers I had to
[1:08:40] I'm part over
[1:08:42] yeah well he's talking about
[1:08:43] identification when you read that story
[1:08:45] as an American it means something to you
[1:08:47] when you go down to Disney World and you
[1:08:49] sit there and watch the Hall of
[1:08:50] Presidents and all the presidents come
[1:08:51] out it means something to you and you
[1:08:53] see the flag waving because you're an
[1:08:55] identified as an American it means all
[1:08:57] those stories all the George Washington
[1:08:59] the stories of how how how he lived and
[1:09:01] the the the the the Liberty that he
[1:09:04] fought for and going crossing the
[1:09:06] Delaware and all those things you're
[1:09:08] identified with it and to be a true
[1:09:10] Christian brother random said you have
[1:09:11] to be the same we don't want to forget
[1:09:13] that all that he was I've identified
[1:09:16] with him I'm identified with him
[1:09:18] that's why in John chapter 14 it says at
[1:09:21] that day ye shall know that I am in my
[1:09:24] father and ye and me and I in you how do
[1:09:29] you know that
[1:09:31] how do you know that that's what I'm
[1:09:33] leading up to
[1:09:34] how do you know
[1:09:36] there
[1:09:37] second Corinthians 13 5 says examine
[1:09:40] yourselves whether ye be in the faith
[1:09:42] examine yourself to see if you're really
[1:09:45] identified with the scripture prove your
[1:09:48] own selves know you're not your own
[1:09:50] selves how that Jesus Christ is in you
[1:09:53] except you be reprobates
[1:09:55] if you're a reprobate he's not in you
[1:09:58] but if the word if you've heard the word
[1:10:00] and it's been born in you he's in you
[1:10:02] that Christ is in you
[1:10:05] you know when you read the Bible when
[1:10:07] you open it up at night and you're
[1:10:08] studying it out it echoes back something
[1:10:11] that was written that was thought of in
[1:10:13] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:10:15] world
[1:10:15] so when you're reading when you're
[1:10:17] reading the word it identifies you it's
[1:10:20] something to a real born-again Christian
[1:10:22] you read these stories that might seem
[1:10:24] mundane and kind of boring to an
[1:10:26] unbeliever or a make-believer but to a
[1:10:29] real born-again Christian it identifies
[1:10:31] you that that is where you come from
[1:10:33] that's why brother Brown we could ask
[1:10:36] that question where were you
[1:10:38] God can ask that question of job where
[1:10:40] were you when the morning star sang
[1:10:43] together and the sons of God shouted
[1:10:46] there shouted for joy before there was a
[1:10:49] foundation of the world he said we were
[1:10:51] identified in the immortal Realms with
[1:10:54] God 10 million years before the world
[1:10:57] was ever formed I'm talking about that
[1:10:59] God thought about you that he had you in
[1:11:02] his mind and he thought about you so
[1:11:04] much that he wove you into his word so
[1:11:06] that when you read the word it's a
[1:11:08] reflection back of the thing that he
[1:11:10] thought about and that is how you are
[1:11:12] identified
[1:11:14] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:11:16] said well then what's the Holy Ghost the
[1:11:18] Holy Ghost is that same spirit of God
[1:11:20] dwelling in the people whom he has died
[1:11:22] for and put their name
[1:11:24] on the Lamb's Book of Life which they
[1:11:27] were one with him in the beginning
[1:11:29] the scripture said so did not Jesus tell
[1:11:33] them that were with him before the
[1:11:34] foundation of the world your minds are
[1:11:36] black and the dark and we all are to
[1:11:37] those things but we're not we're just
[1:11:40] not some little coincident Happening
[1:11:42] Here
[1:11:43] I want to think about that we're not
[1:11:45] just some little coincident Happening
[1:11:47] Here we are Sons and Daughters of God in
[1:11:51] the beginning of the creation of God and
[1:11:53] been dropped down here for a witness to
[1:11:55] witness the grace of God that shed
[1:11:57] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:59] now let's meditate on that God thought
[1:12:01] about it in his mind and in his mind he
[1:12:04] wrote your name down he knew that one
[1:12:07] day you would come and be manifested and
[1:12:09] so one day you were sitting in a little
[1:12:10] Mission somewhere and you heard the word
[1:12:12] be preached which is the the projection
[1:12:14] of that word that God thought of before
[1:12:16] the foundation of the world and it
[1:12:18] grabbed a hold of your life and when you
[1:12:19] believed it and it began to pull you
[1:12:21] back to that
[1:12:23] he said there was a time that you knew
[1:12:25] your mind is darkened to that now
[1:12:27] there's only been one man on Earth that
[1:12:29] knew that that the new that knew that he
[1:12:32] was before and that was Jesus he said
[1:12:34] glorify me father with the glory that I
[1:12:37] had with you before the foundation of
[1:12:38] the world he was the Incarnate God he
[1:12:40] could move back there and know what it
[1:12:42] was
[1:12:43] but our minds are black in there why
[1:12:45] because we skipped the thing we didn't
[1:12:46] come by the word we skipped around that
[1:12:48] so we don't know but we've heard the
[1:12:51] word and that word that we've heard is
[1:12:53] that that that that word that was
[1:12:55] manifested in Genesis 1 26 27 let's draw
[1:12:57] on us back to him that's why in
[1:12:59] Ephesians 1 4 says according as he has
[1:13:01] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:13:04] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:13:07] Without Blame before him in love
[1:13:09] in order to think that God before the
[1:13:11] foundation of the world knew that he
[1:13:13] would love Jacob and hate Esau because
[1:13:15] he knew their reaction to the word what
[1:13:17] it would be on earth and he could look
[1:13:19] ahead down through the stream of time
[1:13:20] and see that they would not love the
[1:13:22] word in Romans chapter 9 verse 13 it
[1:13:25] says as it is written Jacob have I loved
[1:13:27] but Esau have I hated oh friends that's
[1:13:31] what I'm talking about tonight that's
[1:13:32] your identification when you read in the
[1:13:34] Bible all these stories and identifies
[1:13:36] you back with the word back with God's
[1:13:38] thought of you from before the
[1:13:40] foundation of the world to think that
[1:13:42] before anything would happen before
[1:13:44] anything happened we were already chosen
[1:13:47] in him because he knew he could look
[1:13:49] down through the stream of time and know
[1:13:51] how he would react he knew that Jacob
[1:13:53] would want it so God could choose it and
[1:13:55] write his name down
[1:13:57] in in inerasable ink however you want to
[1:14:01] say that
[1:14:04] to think now now listen in the Lamb's
[1:14:06] Book of Life he said now believer have
[1:14:08] you got your joy shoes on
[1:14:10] have you got your joy she's on listen to
[1:14:12] this if you are a Christian if you are
[1:14:15] truly God's child
[1:14:17] that's not no preacher that's the Bible
[1:14:19] he said he said your names was written
[1:14:21] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:14:23] foundation of the world
[1:14:25] oh my the same time that Christ that God
[1:14:28] sent Christ to be slain he wrote your
[1:14:29] name with his that's why every every
[1:14:32] scripture that speaks of Jesus Christ
[1:14:34] also speaks of you because you go
[1:14:37] through the same Journey that Jesus went
[1:14:39] through
[1:14:40] oh that's how you identify
[1:14:43] when you see that then you know that you
[1:14:45] recognize that you are identified with
[1:14:47] Christ because you see the same Journey
[1:14:49] there you are he said and he deceived
[1:14:52] all great small so many were church
[1:14:53] members pertaining to Christians he
[1:14:55] deceived all whose names were not
[1:14:57] written not in the church book but in
[1:14:59] the Lamb's Book of Life when before the
[1:15:01] foundation of the world God wrote your
[1:15:04] name and the Lamb's Book of Life how did
[1:15:06] you how did he write it he's going to
[1:15:08] tell us by his spoken word
[1:15:11] and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to
[1:15:14] redeem that same group that he had wrote
[1:15:15] their names and the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:17] before the foundation of the world now
[1:15:20] it's to think that God actually spoke
[1:15:22] your name
[1:15:23] that he God knew that you would be here
[1:15:26] that you now sitting here if you're
[1:15:28] really born again that you are the word
[1:15:30] present tense that was spoken before
[1:15:33] before God spoke it and now you are that
[1:15:37] word that was spoken before and now
[1:15:40] there's your identification that you are
[1:15:42] that word that word that we read here on
[1:15:44] the the letter of the page that is God's
[1:15:46] word in letter form and when you read
[1:15:49] that and when it's preached over the
[1:15:51] pulpit and you recognize your
[1:15:52] identification that identifies you back
[1:15:54] to that word that was spoken before the
[1:15:57] world the sun and the moon and the stars
[1:15:59] were ever spoken before the first Angel
[1:16:01] was spoken it identifies you back to
[1:16:03] that
[1:16:04] now I know this is a little bit deep for
[1:16:06] being so tired and sleepy
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] to be identified means to establish or
[1:16:14] recognize who or what something or
[1:16:15] someone is oh when you can identify
[1:16:18] yourself that you are a child a child a
[1:16:20] son or a daughter of God
[1:16:23] let's see how we identify yo can y'all
[1:16:26] hang on with me just a few more minutes
[1:16:27] thank you God bless you
[1:16:30] brother Adam said I was with him when he
[1:16:32] called Abraham at the age of 75 years
[1:16:36] old and his wife being 65 and told him
[1:16:40] they were going to have a baby God made
[1:16:43] a promise to Abraham now see when you
[1:16:44] read that and you read you identify your
[1:16:47] own Journey with the journey that
[1:16:49] Abraham went through that God promised
[1:16:51] him that he was going to have a child or
[1:16:53] when you look through your own life and
[1:16:55] you you reckon you can read the promise
[1:16:57] on the day of Pentecost that there's a
[1:16:58] promise of the new birth and you
[1:17:00] Reckoning you I begin to identify your
[1:17:02] same experience with Abraham's journey
[1:17:04] and and because Abraham was a Believer
[1:17:07] and you're a Believer you're both all
[1:17:09] wrapped up in this together that's why
[1:17:11] he said he said every other Christian
[1:17:13] stood with him oh we're all part of
[1:17:16] something we're all part of one great
[1:17:18] big body oh that theophany body the word
[1:17:21] that was spoken before the foundation of
[1:17:23] the world he said I was with Joseph when
[1:17:24] he was rejected of his brothers have you
[1:17:27] ever been rejected because you've been
[1:17:29] spiritual
[1:17:30] yeah and the rest of them was carnal
[1:17:32] maybe at your workplace people didn't
[1:17:34] like you because you were spirited and
[1:17:35] you wanted to pray over your food or
[1:17:37] something and people started making
[1:17:38] maybe when you were in school your
[1:17:39] people would bully you because of the
[1:17:41] way you acted and you now you can
[1:17:43] identify yourself because you you've
[1:17:45] gone through the same thing you ident
[1:17:46] you can identify yourself with the life
[1:17:49] of David how people didn't think that he
[1:17:51] would amount to nothing and oh whatever
[1:17:52] whatever the story is maybe maybe that
[1:17:55] this is the season of your life where
[1:17:56] you can be identified with job and you
[1:17:59] read that and it pops off the page
[1:18:00] because you're living it he said I was
[1:18:03] with Jacob that night when he wrestled
[1:18:05] all night with the angel you if you ever
[1:18:07] wrestled all night with the angel you
[1:18:09] know what this is talking about so you
[1:18:11] can be identified with that when you're
[1:18:13] wrestling and tears are coming down your
[1:18:15] face and you don't know you don't know
[1:18:16] how to move forward and you don't know
[1:18:18] what's around the bend but you're you're
[1:18:20] just calling out the God and wrestling
[1:18:22] over his promises you can be identified
[1:18:25] with Jacob wrestling he said I was with
[1:18:27] Moses at the burning bush and if you
[1:18:29] ever had a burning Bush experience of
[1:18:31] your own you can be identified with
[1:18:32] Moses I was with Moses when all the
[1:18:35] people turned against him
[1:18:36] he said whatever Christian has been
[1:18:38] whatever Believers has been every
[1:18:40] believer now is identified with that
[1:18:42] same person
[1:18:44] and proving his word he said he proves
[1:18:46] all of his words all of his words just
[1:18:49] think of it all of his works
[1:18:52] that means he's talking about you
[1:18:54] he proves all of his words
[1:18:57] and you were his word he was the word
[1:18:59] and you were part of his word and that's
[1:19:02] the reason you're sent here to confirm
[1:19:05] your place in life
[1:19:08] he said I don't think you got that
[1:19:11] see he is the word
[1:19:13] how old I think you are that word that
[1:19:16] was spoken of before the foundation of
[1:19:18] the world and was sent here to confirm
[1:19:20] his word to live it out to prove to the
[1:19:22] devil
[1:19:23] he said I was with Elijah in the days of
[1:19:26] Ahab when they had to make a choice who
[1:19:28] they would serve God or Balaam
[1:19:31] I was with David when he was rejected by
[1:19:33] his own brethren
[1:19:34] I was with Daniel in the Lions Den you
[1:19:37] ever been in the Lion's Den and trusted
[1:19:39] in your God like Daniel did and God
[1:19:42] brought you out
[1:19:43] now you can be identified with Daniel
[1:19:45] because I've lived it I've been there
[1:19:47] I've trusted in God the same way that
[1:19:50] Daniel oh to be identified with that
[1:19:52] Hall of Believers in Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:19:54] all those that just ignore the
[1:19:56] circumstances but look straight to what
[1:19:57] God promised
[1:19:59] he said I most surely was with him at
[1:20:01] Calvary I must be identified with him at
[1:20:03] Calvary I must be there to a place that
[1:20:06] where not also was I identified with him
[1:20:08] at Calvary I died with him at Calvary
[1:20:11] now if you've ever died to yourself you
[1:20:13] can be identified with him at Calvary if
[1:20:15] you've ever died to your own ideas and
[1:20:17] knelt to the altar of self-sacrifice you
[1:20:19] can be identified with him and he said
[1:20:21] now I'm seated with him in Heavenly
[1:20:23] places in Christ Jesus with all the
[1:20:25] powers of Hell conquered through him
[1:20:27] every Christian believer was seated the
[1:20:29] same way because you have to be
[1:20:31] identified
[1:20:34] are you identified with a believing
[1:20:35] Christians of today
[1:20:38] brother man will say he's the same
[1:20:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:42] so there are believers today that you
[1:20:44] have to be identified with
[1:20:45] to be considered a real born-again
[1:20:48] Christian there's been a word for every
[1:20:50] day that's been preached and to be a
[1:20:52] real born again Christian you've got to
[1:20:53] be identified with the present tense
[1:20:55] word of your day
[1:20:57] he said are you identified in his
[1:20:59] ministry
[1:21:00] Jesus's Ministry of today not of
[1:21:03] yesterday not in Martin Luther's day but
[1:21:06] of today do you find yourself that way
[1:21:08] believing it walking with it can you
[1:21:11] stand the reproach like he did see
[1:21:12] identified with him they forgotten
[1:21:15] the world has forgotten the Christian
[1:21:18] world even the denominational world that
[1:21:21] now it's just turned into clubs where
[1:21:23] they're serving Starbucks they've
[1:21:25] forgotten they thought he was just a
[1:21:27] lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they
[1:21:29] forgot that he was God they forgot that
[1:21:31] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:21:33] forever forever they don't understand it
[1:21:35] no more
[1:21:36] I'm going to be closing in just a minute
[1:21:38] y'all don't get too worried you can get
[1:21:41] a little bit worried that's all right
[1:21:42] just don't get too worried
[1:21:46] yeah
[1:21:47] he said I was identified with Peter's
[1:21:49] sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts
[1:21:51] the second chapter
[1:21:53] I heard what he said I believe what he
[1:21:55] said I obeyed what he said oh if he can
[1:21:59] when you read that story and identify oh
[1:22:01] if you've been there you can be
[1:22:03] identified with it
[1:22:08] let me let me skip through some of this
[1:22:11] he said I like a genuine Thoroughbred
[1:22:13] that's real gentle that know where he'd
[1:22:15] come from and we know where you come
[1:22:18] from because we come from the word we've
[1:22:19] been born of the spirit when you look
[1:22:21] into the Bible and you hear you hear the
[1:22:23] message being played on your tape at
[1:22:25] home or in the car or you hear the
[1:22:27] gospel preach it identifies you and
[1:22:29] tells you where you come from a
[1:22:31] thoroughbred's got pedigree papers to
[1:22:33] show where you come from and we've got
[1:22:34] the scripture the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ to show where we come from
[1:22:38] where'd you come from
[1:22:39] in Luke chapter 10
[1:22:41] Jesus told his disciples he said behold
[1:22:44] I give you power to tread on serpents of
[1:22:46] scorpions they got they had power they
[1:22:48] cast out devils and do great Miracles
[1:22:49] and signings and wonders but he said now
[1:22:51] don't be happy about that that's
[1:22:53] wonderful but he said notwithstanding in
[1:22:55] this Rejoice that Rejoice not that the
[1:22:58] spirits are subjects under you but
[1:22:59] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:23:03] written down in heaven
[1:23:05] and that's where the title of this
[1:23:07] sermon comes from are you on God's list
[1:23:09] because God had a list in heaven of
[1:23:11] names that he spoke before the
[1:23:14] foundation of the world and if you're on
[1:23:16] that list if your name is on that list
[1:23:18] you know it's on that list when you're
[1:23:20] identified with the word when you hear
[1:23:22] the word preached and something Echoes
[1:23:24] back to identify with it it gives you
[1:23:26] confidence
[1:23:27] oh that's that's what the Seven Seals
[1:23:30] are for to give us confidence that God
[1:23:32] has fully redeemed us that we're going
[1:23:33] to take a body change to show us where
[1:23:36] we come from and Hebrews chapter 7 he
[1:23:38] said it's God blessed be the name of the
[1:23:40] Lord It's God that worketh he said if
[1:23:42] Jesus was slain before the foundation of
[1:23:44] the world it taken four thousand years
[1:23:46] before it actually happened
[1:23:48] but when God spoke it back here every
[1:23:52] word of God is steadfast it's immutable
[1:23:55] it's impartable
[1:23:57] that's a new word to me impartable it
[1:23:59] cannot fail and when God slayed the sun
[1:24:02] before the foundation of the world he
[1:24:03] was just as much slain then as he was at
[1:24:05] Calvary it's a finished product When God
[1:24:08] says so and remember when the lamb was
[1:24:11] slain your salvation was included in the
[1:24:13] sacrifice because the Bible said that
[1:24:16] your name was written on the Lamb's Book
[1:24:18] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:24:20] world
[1:24:21] how do I know how do I know my name was
[1:24:23] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:24:24] because you're acting it out now whether
[1:24:27] or not your name was written was
[1:24:29] determined by your reaction now present
[1:24:31] tense what's happening right now but to
[1:24:34] think that God had a place reserved for
[1:24:37] you because he knew your reaction right
[1:24:39] now how it would be he knew when it was
[1:24:41] offered to you if you would respond or
[1:24:43] not he said the message Perfection he
[1:24:45] said notice not only Christ was slain to
[1:24:47] take away sin but your name was written
[1:24:49] in the Lamb's Book of Life God wrote
[1:24:52] your name associated with his before the
[1:24:54] foundation of the world now Satan make
[1:24:56] them get scared now get them to doubt
[1:24:58] that before the world ever began God
[1:25:00] called your name you Christians and
[1:25:03] wrote it in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:05] before the world ever started saith the
[1:25:08] Bible
[1:25:09] he said in the message Jehovah Jireh
[1:25:11] I'll be closing in just a moment he said
[1:25:12] those who he foreign to you he called
[1:25:14] those who he called he justified those
[1:25:17] who he has Justified he has already
[1:25:19] glorified what are you scared about
[1:25:22] that's right and the Antichrist in the
[1:25:25] last days according to Revelations
[1:25:26] deceived all that dwelt upon the face of
[1:25:28] the Earth whose names were not written
[1:25:31] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:34] that's when your name was put in the
[1:25:37] Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was
[1:25:39] slain God spoke the word it was in his
[1:25:43] thinking
[1:25:44] in his thought he spoke the word
[1:25:48] and everything happened just at that
[1:25:50] time
[1:25:51] this is just God's seed materializing
[1:25:55] that's all his words coming down now if
[1:25:59] you're confused about the seed there's
[1:26:01] your answer this is just God's seed
[1:26:05] materializing that's all
[1:26:08] his words coming down
[1:26:10] now when the light of God flashes across
[1:26:13] that quickly that seed recognizes it so
[1:26:15] as the musicians come we'll answer ask
[1:26:17] this question where were you where were
[1:26:19] you when the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:26:22] where were you can you be identified
[1:26:25] with the scripture
[1:26:27] can you be identified with that word
[1:26:29] that was spoken before the foundation of
[1:26:30] the world
[1:26:31] brother Ram told it maybe as a
[1:26:33] musician's kind of play something softly
[1:26:34] that brother I'm told that story or that
[1:26:36] French soldier that soldier that got so
[1:26:38] shocked
[1:26:39] just like people as they go from
[1:26:41] different churches and hear false
[1:26:43] Doctrine they begin to wonder what's
[1:26:44] true and what's not this Soldier was so
[1:26:46] shocked that they were going to put him
[1:26:48] in an insane asylum and they loaded him
[1:26:50] up on a train and they stopped somewhere
[1:26:52] just to get a break and and one of the
[1:26:54] guards follow them as that Soldier began
[1:26:56] to walk and he's turned at this stop and
[1:26:59] he turned at the next stop and he just
[1:27:00] kept walking and walking until finally
[1:27:02] he walked up to this door and an old man
[1:27:04] came out
[1:27:06] and he said my son I knew that you were
[1:27:09] going to come home he had somehow wound
[1:27:11] up at his daddy's doorstep
[1:27:14] and he recognized all of a sudden he
[1:27:16] remembered where you come from
[1:27:18] you see that's what the word that's what
[1:27:19] the word of God that's the effect that
[1:27:21] the word of God has in our life it
[1:27:23] causes us to remember where we come from
[1:27:26] that God thought about you before the
[1:27:28] foundation of the world he had a portion
[1:27:30] of himself reserved for you in this hour
[1:27:32] and when you hear the word and recognize
[1:27:35] it it identifies you back with that just
[1:27:37] like that French soldier was identified
[1:27:38] back oh he said oh that's my daddy he
[1:27:41] realized that's my daddy that's where I
[1:27:42] come from and his eyes were open and he
[1:27:45] began to realize he recognized he was
[1:27:46] identified with his home and where where
[1:27:49] he was
[1:27:50] whole friend if you're not identified
[1:27:52] with the word
[1:27:54] once you take this opportunity
[1:27:56] to yield yourself to give yourself the
[1:27:58] Lord once you let's stand to our feet
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:03] we ask this question are you are you on
[1:28:05] God's list
[1:28:07] can we can we bow our hands just a
[1:28:09] moment
[1:28:10] let's bow our hands this morning if you
[1:28:12] want to be on God's list
[1:28:14] once you raise your hand
[1:28:17] lift up your hand to the Lord

[1:28:22] Lord Jesus oh these hands Raised To You

[1:28:28] you're still calling Lord Jesus Lord

[1:28:32] calling your drawing by Your Word Lord
[1:28:34] Jesus this still priest over a Pulpit or
[1:28:37] God and I believe that it still has the
[1:28:39] same effect as it had thousands it has
[1:28:41] had for thousands of years Lord Jesus
[1:28:44] Lord the scripture says because you are
[1:28:46] sin Sons God has sent forth the spirit
[1:28:48] of his son into your hearts crying I'm a
[1:28:50] father I thank God before before the
[1:28:53] worlds were created you knew he was
[1:28:55] going to be a son and you had it
[1:28:57] prepared and because of that he sent
[1:28:59] forth his Spirit into our hearts God
[1:29:01] you've given us the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:03] Ghost to identify us back with that word
[1:29:05] that was preached that was spoken before
[1:29:07] the foundation of the world Lord Jesus
[1:29:09] we just asked Lord your blessing upon
[1:29:11] this service now Lord Jesus your
[1:29:12] blessing upon the people bless every
[1:29:14] hand that was raised your God that has a
[1:29:16] desire to draw closer to you Lord God

[1:32:43] Lantern how do I get home and it was
[1:32:46] just if you look on the map it's
[1:32:47] probably uh about a five mile walk and
[1:32:50] he'd hold that Lantern out in front of
[1:32:52] him and he said he said Hey brother I'm
[1:32:54] asking how are you going to get home and
[1:32:55] he said put just put one foot in front
[1:32:57] of the other and as I hold this light up
[1:33:00] and God has given us the light of his
[1:33:02] word if we'll just keep walking in that
