========================================

I'm sorry just talk about that's what you um praise God for some reason I had forgotten about this I'm so sorry um there's a video I wanted y'all to see um yesterday for some reason I was just sitting at home and um I'm trying to train myself like literally every day read the Bible pray learn something about brother brunham or one of his sermons cuz somebody like me we grew up in the message but we didn't know what was going on or I remember the first time I found out about Adam and Eve my older sister is the one who was like we were in Kenya she's like oh they you know they didn't really eat an apple and I'm like okay so um for me I'm having to play cash up on some things but as a young person I always tell people um I always want to I want to be an example but not a bad example cuz I'm not perfect but at the same time I know what it is to have children and raise them in this world um so I started watching this YouTube video uh while I was um in my room and um some I I wish I can play the video maybe next time but somehow brother Bram just blurted out he was praying and he said and there's a sister laying down who has issues with the surgery didn't go well something about um the doctors they're not really good at what they do I mean he and I'm just sitting there froze and I had to keep replaying it just to make sure I'm hearing the right thing and and he didn't stop there he kept going and saying she's very frustrated and she has mental issues or something like that because of the military I'm like what I didn't know how to explain that I don't know what it is um so I sent the video to my mom and my family and stuff like that and they were like yeah he apparently he's my older sister told me he's healed people like that before I didn't know but um I've just never done anything like that like on a you know Saturday evening like I'm watching so to me he spoke to me somehow I don't know how because I'm the kind of person I want to see I guess maybe because of being in the military I want to see like right there you know and if I'm going to do something I'm not going to do it halfway I don't know how to do two things at the same time it has to be one way so for a very long time I've always said um if I was to ever die before let's hope now God will somehow consider me but I always used to tell my family look I already know where I'm going if I died right now cuz I'm doing the opposite of what that man said and even if I was to die and go to hell I will tell him the same thing there's nobody else here so because the devil is really bad and I used to have really bad nightmares like he would come to my room and I would see this man right there you know so he's he's tormented me so much to the point where somehow it worked to my favor because it got to a point where um when he would come to my room I just kick him off the bed and I'm like you wait how why are you waking me up at 3:00 in the morning you know like that's how that's how we got but most people think like the devil is just oh he's a tail no he's literally a normal human being very goodlooking and everything so I have seen and experienced all that so going through all that that gave me the assurance that Mary you've gone through all this and you still want to live in the you know you know what the truth is it's people like you who are going to and I was okay with it so once I started saying that he stopped coming the Lord but guess what he's back now like now that I'm trying to do everything right I can literally feel him to the point where some of my caregivers tell me I'm seeing something moving around I don't know what it is I'm like just pray I don't know how else to help you cuz for me he won't um come at me during the day he's a coward he'll only do it when I'm sleeping right you know cuz he knows my mind is not there or something like that so um but I'm not scared of that puppet um but other than that that's what I wanted to say thank you'all amen we got a few requests remember the one from this morning A lot of people are traveling we mentioned them this morning just remember them brother boy also asking for sister Audrey Thomas and Sister Janet also remember those two Sister Charlotte G me one says please pray pray for sister Gail she's having trouble with her blood pressure so remember Sister Gail still remember me and all the other ones that are going through that situation sister milka gave me one says please remember a family of M of a friend of Michael who has a construction business so remember that situation there to remember whatever the need is whatever the thought is let it be known to them and they'll whatever it is the Lord will take care of it so just remember that I know we all have unspoken request remember also I'm sorry remember also before we go this afternoon at the shower it is a ladies only so if the guys are still here you need to stay out and let just let the ladies go to the to the shower is what I've been told so just remember that and keep the kids outside if you're if you have kids so just remember that as we pray like I said I know we all have unspoken request let's go to Lord and pray

with you my pawn shop testimony in my journey you all know that when you can pick up bits and pieces from my life I was straight up Le oia this particular time straight up Le oia good job I lived right across the street from the job I was able to walk there and that was the one at it was called The Institute of living in Harford Connecticut little history on that place it used to be called the Harford Retreat where all the movie stars would go to dry out but when I got there it was only two that I knew of Sammy Davis Jr had someone there and Phil Donahue um I worked as the Director of social activities that's the rehabilitation department and we would have meetings every morning and after we took care matters at hand during coffee and donut time all of a sudden I just blurred it out I'm moving to Atlanta now y'all know prior to that I didn't know the Lord my mother honored the Lord by Sunday Sabbath we couldn't do anything that's all I knew I didn't pray I didn't pay no t uh ties nowhere I wasn't going to church I would go to a Baptist Church to please my grandmother just to make a smile on her face but that's all I knew and then I blurt that out at the meeting and then within a few months I was down here and I even said I don't know where it came from I said okay Lord now that I'm here what you going to do with me and a few months later um I was working oh I was also modeling at that time so I figured waitressing will keep my figure right so I was working at a Mexican restaurant as a waitress and um brother Andre headed and brother Hollis Brown came in one day see how the Lord works man that was awesome because that was my introduction to the Lord certainly brother Hollis was trying to wrap to get a date and we did date he gave me my first Bible that

places Lord to India Lord I pray you be with them I pray that you would touch us now during this service you have the preeminent you be the preeminent one and that you'll be made known to the people that's what we want more than anything we want you to be made known in the people not in one person not to look to one man because man will fail but look to you father the author and finisher of our faith Lord be with us during this service father you take complete control in Jesus name we pray Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh that's what he wanted to do he had to be flesh to be your kinsman redeemer as we were talking about this morning in the pawn shop and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's go to first second Peter 1 verse 5 and excuse me if I continue reading on some of you want to read in your Bible I'll hesitate a moment I think we're kind of lazy loud of say as we just read what's on the screen so and I do the same thing and besides this besides what besides all that we talked about this morning besides all that pawn shop where we come in and come out in and Redemption and and paying the ransom and and you know uh doing the right thing and and getting the new birth besides that besides that you're out of the pawn shop now what are you going to do you going to just lay there nope and besides this giving all diligence wow diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance we'll get to that today to Temperance patience and patience godliness Luke 21: 19 says in your patience in your patience possess ye your very soul in your patience possess ye your very Soul you may be seated Lord Has His blessings that's the problem we have in the end time we are not patient people people will absolutely run you off the road just to get the ne be the next person in line to stop at the traffic light I love traffic lights it's the great equalizer our stop signs right somebody fly by you and they'll pass you and and you know half a mile down the road they're sitting in front of a red light and you just pull right up behind them and you wasted gas buddy but patience in your patience possess ye your souls wow that's pretty tough but let's talk about knowledge and Temperance first before we get to patience cuz there's a lot of temperance going on when somebody passes you and you don't like it right right you give them the old you left or right hand of Fellowship yeah so let's go back to the Chart excuse me I got a little tick on my throat I might have been hollering too much this morning also I was hollering too much this morning you said amen okay prob you have to be careful what you amen you say oh me can somebody say Oh Me Oh Me Okay but we were in that pawn shot Listen by our Birth by our first birth we got put in that pawn shop we were not supposed to be born that way but we were born in sin shapen in iniquity a spouse from our mother's womb a liar doomed and on our way to Hell our soul is what's going to go to hell your body's not going to hell per se your body's going to follow but Jesus told him he said don't worry about the guy that can kill your body don't worry about the guy in other words that can can cut your head off he said you bar worry about the one that can kill your soul there's only one person that can kill a soul and that's the Lord Jesus our God Almighty he's the only one that can kill a soul he made it so he can kill it all right you and I can't do away with one we can you know Satan can do what he wants to he can take us out of this Dimension fleshly but we step right over into another dimension and there we are just as Eternal as God is in another dimension hidden away from Satan Satan can't find us he I don't think Satan even knows where that sixth Dimension is god holds that for up for the people that are passed on Lord so that they can be what happy and so that they can say hey I made it but then remember they're not complete though they got to come back here and get their human body they know they're not humans you were a human here you're going to be a human there all right Supernatural human but you're going to be a human so your soul is what the whole deal is so if you want if you want the Lord Jesus to save your soul then there's where that the pawn shop you got put in you got to believe that somebody went to that pawn shop paid the price took you out and remember what I said this morning never have to pay that again you never have to go back and say I think I'll pay you no it was paid once for all simple salvation is he paid the price once for all that's our problem which like I said before he get everything gets thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness and we just pull it right back out it's gone out of his mind he doesn't remember it no more listen if God remembers your sin you're in trouble if God remembers your sin you're a sinner if you're not if you're a born again Christian he cannot listen that's where the Judgment part is that's why if you'll get this Simple Plan of Salvation it's just so neat how that God can do that that he can take and clean your soul out your soul be just as Eternal as God is but the rest of you be completely dying like this this thing dying and your spirit realm that's where Satan is going to be digging at you from the time from here till the time you get out of here one way or the other cuz he can't bother your soul he can't get in there unclean spirit's gone out of that thing and it will not get back in if it's full of the Holy Ghost all right like I said today this morning that there's that pawn shop that's taking you the person what is the person is this your person no brother B said you don't see the real William Brandon you don't see the real Donnie faush the real Donnie faush is inside that now what he displays are he um manifest what's inside of him he's joh fush he was born to um hazel and Tom faush all right right had a brain burp there for a minute yeah but that that's where the natural part you can see came from but the soul come from God right soul come from God for whether he's born again or not so the soul comes from God that's the real person it came from God now what happens is you come down here the prophet even tells us you come down here to make your choice to make your decision is right here now he saw you make it before the foundation of the world and he predestinated because he predetermined what he saw he didn't predetermine what he wanted right come on he didn't predetermine what he wanted cuz he wanted all to be saved and everybody's not going to be saved but he saw who would and who wouldn't he saw who would say God get me out of this pawn shop and I don't want to ever go back to that place again ain't there places you've been in your life that you never for a millionar you wouldn't go back to that same spot again I've got about 10 or 12 of them I'd be a multi-millionaire if I did that amen I never go back to that place cuz I know what happened you know what happened you're the only one one that knows what happened but God doesn't even know it now if you're born again forget about it you can't forget about it but you can soften it a lot right by saying God you told me in your Bible that if I believe on you you'll put every bit of my sin in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again right that's why Jesus stood up to those Pharisees and he said you used to have a way out you had a cloak for your problems and your issues and your sin but now you don't the word has been presented to you the way it's supposed to been in the Old Testament in flesh I am here now I the Messiah I am the Son of God son of man whatever title you want to give him back and forth but they knew when he started speaking that if you'll watch that um series called chosen when he talks about the son of man you watch them two Pharisees why do they always wear black always got on black like there's some dark they are dark Spirits coming in he called himself the son of man they knew what he was talking about like brother Bob was talking about they knew what happened in the garden they knew it was by fornication that they were well look at them they knew they came wrong so they' have to teach them about an apple that's why they stood one day and said we be not born of fornication like you are but he wasn't born of fornication he was born by born by God Amen he knew who his daddy was do we do we know who our father our proger is not your dad sitting there and you know seven rows from here your heavenly father that's why we have to deny you can't put away your first birth but you can deny that that's what's going to shap you come on deny that oh I'm this way because my daddy was this way well you know what I'm this way because what my daddy is too amen I'm this way because my daddy made me this way my real dad made me this way I got good characters from my daddy but I got some bad ones PA everybody gets quiet what was that question we asked at at the banquet that brought a lot of contention cuz I asked him sister and I said does your husband act more like his mama or his daddy oh Lord you ought to seen them looks at each other especially when one would say mama and the other one would say Daddy and I am so glad that I was the moderator you see I as being the moderator I don't have to I don't have to you know this all this you've never seen looks like you see when you you see them people look at each other like they know this is the answer they know my wife's going to say this and they'll say blue and she'll say pink especially those new ones the new people we kind of know each other I could answer every one of them questions for most of y'all but some of the new people you know you kind they kind of look at each other that one couple they needed a lot of work all way back to Dallas they should have been talking about some stuff but listen do you know of your heavenly father that way who's your daddy we always say that to be funny who's your daddy well I know who my daddy is I hope we act like our daddy you said well we have sure we have problems we listen we've got that one spot of humanity cuz we were born through a womb all right this is that one spot you're not going to get rid of everybody with me about that size right there brother M said this thing will be sticky till the change You' got that one Sticky Thing which you know in your mind how you got here if y'all didn't you need to go talk to your spouse and find out what happened but you know how you got here and there's no denying that from what I see standing here or sitting here but inside of us it's not another person oh sure it's a person of Jesus Christ but you are a unit so that unit when the soul is changed then it starts work into the spirit realm and then we display it with this this is still going to look like Samuel and Peggy Dale but inside of me you you got to realize there's an 18y old person right that looks just like he did when he was 18 years old but that's the way God did he put this one to this one and this one to this one to get you here he put a genetic brother Aaron he's all into this genetic stuff one day he's going to find out he come from somewhere he maybe didn't want to Elvis Presley maybe I don't know but yeah okay all right I shouldn't have said that I apologize but you know genealogies are good but what can you do about it number one and what are you going to do about it number two that's right I don't care who I came from I came from God and I'm going back to God if you got to New Birth you came literally you came from God and you going back to God he took a picture of you brother R said before the foundation of the world what a photographer I bet it was an HD too I bet it wasn't no camera roll I wasn't you know that flash stuff no it was high definition cuz he knows exactly your character you know why because he did he took this one and this one this one to this one this one to this one this one to this one to get you here in the personality you're supposed to be and the features you're supposed to be What a Mighty God that has you know he's in control this whole thing we have a part in it sure by our choices but he's he's going to have somebody that's going to look like him praise the Lord to our soul there's the found found there's the whole thing if we get that right to begin with then we can start on the building we can get the foundation right we can get started to do this next part in add to your new birth add to the real you what does ADD mean to minister just what we're doing now listen if you've not grown if you're a Christian and you haven't grown I'd go back and figure out whether I was a Christian or not listen things are going to bother us always always you need to cover the weak part that you were before you got born again and know what brother R said he said Satan knows your weakness and he said you better throw that FL that you better throw that Shield up well you keep it there keep it up there and just keep doing keep putting the shield of what faith believing that God's going to take care of you but you got to get behind it remember what Eve's problem was brother Brown said eve came around and got in front and that's what our problem is we want to help God not have a lot of patience definitely not have a lot of temperance but your soul is the real you so that's the real person that we've been trying to deal with for six months and still get I'm still coming back to it cuz we got to know that we're born again before we can add Paul Peter knew he was born again he knew on the day of Pentecost he stood up and said this is that this is that Joel says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I was thinking about that just a few minutes ago brother border somebody sent me the clip for the ashberry that re Revival they're having that could be the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but that could is be anointed ones too cuz they don't know what they're shouting about and didn't brother B say they shout but they don't know what they're shouting about they can say Jesus Jesus and not get anything they get an outpouring of the Holy Ghost you know why I call this outpouring I believe on us and with us it's going on down it's digging a deeper well it's going to our soul right because we have the right teaching we know what the right word is we know what God does to our soul it's not just a well you know I'm I'm a Christian today and I'm not tomorrow and I'm up here them down here hey somewhere folks you going to have to put a nail down or a big old steak and say this is it this is it Minister nourishment never will get finish with this to supply to be supplied so add what's an additive in a in a if you get gasoline Donnie's already told us that that there's really only a couple of types of oil they may be castol Valvoline and all those different brands but there's only just a few because what they do is they put a different label on it and send it out right brother Donnie Valene is about the most cleanest and the best one he knows cuz he's in the industry same way with microwaves they put LG on about five or six of them they put GE on five or six of them they slap this on it's the same identical thing that's the devil yeah God will let us know what we need we just got to know where to get it at which would be in the fivefold ministri which is I believe the only way for us to get out of here but I will restore now I will restore to you so we talking about that this morning let's continue on we know what ate it down it was creased and denominational ideas and our own ideas is what eats the word of God down all right then brother Bown give us the the uh vision and and I like what somebody said the other day we were talking about something and we can talk about Vision Visions are great and aren't Visions great it's great to hear Brother Brown talk about a vision I was looking and I saw a bride or I was looking and I saw the red the the green checky shirt right my brother bco was that he was going hunting he was going to kill this caribou and this grizzly bear he said there was a young man he Young young hand he saw him in the vision but he saw a green checked shirt right that's just real to me to me it's just wonderful to listen to those but it don't mean deadly squat to me if I'm not in division it's wonderful to tell the story of it but I got to be in it if not I'm left out but I am in the vision he saw and I don't care if I'm that bride to got out of Step he said she got back in line she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch when she's passing by as she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever they were getting back trying their best what wait a minute they were what they were trying their best to get back in line amen try your best to get back in line just get in line they were looking what what were they looking at they Wen looking at the god of right here they were looking what's going on out J what's going on out in the political world what's going out over here in this place and what's going on in this church and what's going on not watching where you walking yourself what they were looking somewhere else watching about that church listen you start looking at that church out there you are going to get got to step in this line of the Bride but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of step out a little bit to the right hand side look like was trying to get back in line as they went by they just passed me oh far as here to there to the wall remember what he said at the at the end of the real Vision he was telling he said he said he woke up saying get back in line or get back in Step well that's the message that's the message we got now get back in line get back in step with God but this Bride Comes in view twice God loves us so much he there's a bride showing here and then he's going to show a bride in the end time even though she might be a little bit out of Step she's going to get back in line cuz she is b r i d e she is bride she is not Church she's bride she's the wife of Jesus Christ she will get back in line amen yes the seed fell in the ground at Nia that was the original seed she came through the what the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last day I will restore that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time through the first three Church ages she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain why' brother Brown say that cuz his message was grain message his message was coming up through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost but he said it was the four life Messengers last one was the word the last one is not a stalk it's not a tassel it's not a shuck it's the very seed that went in the ground and that's what we're feeding on now we're feeding on the grain we're not feeding on the stock the stock won't grow itself back the seed well the seed word of God we listen to every Wednesday night every Sunday every time we press play every time we talk about the word of God there's got to be something a reaction don't fall behind this is a living word this is not oh yeah sometimes it looks like dry bones sometimes yall really look like dry bones but it looks like dry bones but remember that Army came to life l f that Army came to life by what by the word by that fourth message that came today this living message this word of God this that we're looking at today you're sitting in the right place today not the seat you're sitting in you're sitting in the right place in the word of God thank you Jesus listen Luther got a part no doubt he's well known all over the world Wesley all over the world Methodist there's a method of religion there's a method of worship and God said I'll take that right now but let's move on then you got the Pentecostals which come with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they got gifts in the church they had Happy Times They had wonderful times speaking in tongues God prophesying talking to to people through people but the last of it remember brother rown talks about being you know the water coming up to here and the Bible tells us the water keeps coming up then he tells us he goes on and tells us he talks about the neck he said but once you get in the intelligence there are no more moving parts from here up there's no moving Parts but now what's going on now some of you may have an issue with this there's something going on above my eyes I done told you easy from here up there's something going on right now I am processing so are you well some of you are not but you're processing listen milliseconds you're processing thousands and hundreds of thousands of memor because when I make a quote what do you do you say I heard that Sunday I heard that last week I heard that on a tape I know what he's talking about it's just like this so there you know what this is what I'm telling you there's no moving Parts look this is moving Parts this is the Pentecost but when it comes to the intelligence the knowledge of God you can't see me I can be standing just like this and have a revelation that just burn that's why you got your temperature is 98.6 well some of them may be a little lower because of volume but not you buddy but that's why you're your temperature kids that's why you have a temperature your body's firing it's a fire mechanism it's working it's going it's that's why I'm sweating right now cuz it's going but I'm doing this but from here up nobody sees it working but you and nobody sees it working but God God sees that you're thinking about him instead of having to work on a how to work on a tractor or what Walmart's got on sale tomorrow tomorrow's Monday all y'all will be healed so you'll be fine all you sisters are going to that play tomorrow M you'll sit there three hours and watch that show never bad an eye I'm going somewhere with this never bad an eye you going to be there 30 minutes early and you going to stay there the whole time and you going to watch that show cuz that's what you like why can't you do that sitting here oh I know you don't like me that's okay but I'm trying to save your soul I don't care about your feelings I really do not I care about your soul I want your soul saved but I want you to realize that's how close it is you God's watching you not me it's strange how they you can't come to church on Sunday but I look on Facebook on Monday and you You' got in an airplane and flew for four hours to a for a trip that week I'm preaching now but come on where's your desire where's your desire but in the last day of Malachi 4 I'm telling you the truth I'm not trying to tell you I'm not trying to upset you but I hope it does Amen cuz how you going to get it listen some of us get no I don't say us some of y'all get it just I mean like some of us is like I don't want that but then the Lord said yeah you need that that's then you what you go swallow that Temperance and say Lord I know he hates me I mean he loves me but he hates s brother Dell Brother D you know brother D loved y'all he still does I don't say love but when he was up up here just firing away but he say some things that that sometimes you go wow it's like like brother Claud said he said I was listening to your watch your dad the other day and said I just know I heard heads hitting the ground I know they were rolling down that center aisle but it was done with love he's trying to save your soul not worrying about the rest of you cuz look if he can save that thing right there and brale can't save you know that but he can get you to a point to where he can put you in contact with that guy and there's nothing between my soul and my savior there's no excuse that we'll ever have especially in this church that you can't get your soul Sav we're not going to sit here and tell you that that Soul was fine it was good when you was a baby God was already in there don't worry about it you are saved for the foundation of world well yeah you w in the mind of God but not in that same thing you're sitting in that's right I was going to say something else a sorry thing you sitting in but we all speci sorry people we come from a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil okay four Killers took it look they weren't nice they ate that tree down they had a purpose to eat the word of God down so that it would have no effect but thank God prophesy son of man can these bones live yes they can cuz there's creative power in the word of God that's created Power in speaking the word of God right can these bones live what's the four stages come forth of the church what's the four stage of Ezekiel dry bones but the life only come not when the senu skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of Life Jesus stood one day and told the disciples he said receive receive you the Holy Ghost now they didn't receive it then that was a potential that was a that was saying you're going to receive it on the day of Pentecost he didn't get he couldn't give them the new birth he couldn't give the Holy Ghost before he died right amen is everybody with me on that brother Brown said potentially they had the opportunity to receive that Breath of Life listen Jesus's natural breath can't save you right it's just breath he wouldn't talk about that he's talking about that part that was inside of him he said I'm going to make your dry bones I'm going to make them breathe and it's going to be the breath of eternal life not the Breath of Life all right the fourth stage was the word let's keep on going we got to get we got to get somewhere brother talks about what's the time when the sons of God is ever to be manifest today today listen and we can't manif if you're manifesting God and you're not get get any joy in your life and you're not getting any anything going on with God as far as reading and studying getting Revelation and and really loving to do what God said go back to the bottom and let's start over again nature is waiting on us as we were praying Lord there's what 30,000 people died in that one earthquake what was it that turkey yeah 30,000 people one earthquake 7 point something that's going to be a pimple to what's going to happen in California millions are going to die in just a few seconds much less more as the day keeps going on and they can't get to them and they're in their buildings and they're under the ocean drowning why cuz they turn the word of God down there won't be a bride in that part was there a bride in Jerusalem not when Titus you know why they did what the word said Jesus told them get out of here when you see that get out of this city there wasn't a Believer inside that City you get caught in the city worry about your belief spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ to have join him and his church together listen you going to be hated if you tell the truth you going to be hated people going to hate you Bible says have I become your enemy why cuz I've told you the truth right because people hat Satan hates truth he does not like it he hates truth all right besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge now here knowledge we've been talking about knowledge but I want you to understand something about knowledge this knowledge is not knowledge to get you through school okay okay high school college right now you can put that two together and use Holy Ghost knowledge if you'll put him first then your knowledge you know brother R said he said he said take the kitties and and let and get around the table and if says one of them said Dad I'm having a test today I mean how many y'all have ever done that don't raise your hand you kids say man I'm having a hard time Dad Mom I got test tomorrow let's get down here and pray you know what's the first thing we say I'm sorry first thing I say go in your room and study cut off your computer and get in there and study well let's stop and pray about it first seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and then all these other things will come into line all right keep kids if you want to do good on a test get your Godly Parents by the hand and say look I know I know that it's going to be tough cuz you really got to use your your black matter you got to use your white matter brain or your gray matter you got to use that cuz you're a human let me put it this way God's not going to take the test for you but he's going to give you the knowledge to remember what you learned in school or learn that that was the whole thing with me I listen to the teachers a lot of people they just sat there you know shot bit watch and throw paper airplanes out the window and you know talked about the girlfriend or was worried about what they was going to do after school I listen and I didn't have to take a book home I didn't make a beat till I got to college that's a fact I can't say that about the other two in the family but happened to me but what did I do though I it brought my brain brought back what I had learned same thing with the Gospel Holy Ghost knowledge will do what it'll bring things to what the Bible says to your remembrance whatsoever in other words whatsoever you heard not something you didn't hear amen right that's right you can't get a revelation of something you don't know just a little bit about you got to know a little bit about it before you get a revelation and you might have the wrong interpretation but God will turn that thing and say no this is it remember brother brandham brother brandham he all thought that the new birth was just love remember it's what he said he taught that the new birth was just love love everybody he said the angel corrected me on that see we may not have an angel come in our bedroom but we got preachers coming on Sundays and Wednesdays with an Angel that's going to tell you that your Revelation is a little bit off brother Brown was going to preach that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost he said that right he said if the angel hadn't come in the room and corrected me that's a prophet that's somebody that you think man he's just got a connection with God and everything God says he just said no he's human we're human beings so he said no prophet he said you need to go back and read that again I think you missed it that guy's a bluff and he said my God's Not a bluff Satan may be a bluff but I'm not so Bo hear then then see the brother R said oh I was going to make a horrible mistake I was going to teach that that man that was the off devil was God a prophet don't get quiet on me that's what he said our it's on tape but knowledge signifies general intelligence understanding knowledge of what Christian religion the deeper and more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced so we are we don't have just knowledge now we had a knowledge that we were born again now we must have Holy Ghost knowledge to teach us more cuz listen there's John 3:16 is in the Bible it takes up about that much of that whole Bible you can't just hone in on that right right you got 66 other books and all them chapters and all them verses that's what that's yours if you plug into John 3:16 you'll learn all those other things such as belong to the more advanced especially of things lawful lawful for Christians moral wisdom such as in seen and right living see we have a knowledge now when brother brandham he comes and he's he's teaching the word of God and the word's opening up to each one of us am I boring you okay you got quiet a little bit brother brandham comes and he teaches and he's standing there and he says that father son Holy Ghost baptism is not right th thousands of people hung their soul on that that it was right think about it think with me a minute here's brother Bown now I'm teaching it to y'all and y'all are going oh yeah that's right okay yeah yeah let's move on yeah I know about the water baptism I I know that father son Holy Ghost I know it's not right but what about a group of people that built their whole soul their whole religion was based on that and he's trying to change their mind and they're resenting one right after the other and you know he can feel it yeah you know he could feel it you know where it was coming from cuz a lot of time he stopped he said I wouldn't think that if I were you I it's like whoa what happened here yeah you know what that person they had an uhoh moment they're like oh but think about that see it's easy for us then see when I preach it or anybody pre and it just flows even like the brother the other day said he liked preaching here why cuz it flows there's no resistance it just flows cuz we all have an understanding of the message of the hour but it's really tough to preach um to it would be if you went to a Baptist Church what Would You Preach father son Holy Ghost is not baptism uh the Trinity is not even in the Bible I mean here we go what are we going to do then all that's coming back those Spirits are coming back towards you and it hinders the move of God and that's what brother R was saying it hindered the move of God to move on through those denominations out into not his message but the truth so it was hindering so he had to have listen he had to have every one of those virtues or he would have just I well if it' have been me I'd have got mad at him and said I'm done with you I'm going back somewhere and I'm you know he even said that one time right he said I wish that I could do like Elijah and just step out and and give a prophecy and go back to the mountains and never see another person right that's what he said why he got tired of fooling with them Spirits every time he preached he come he tell the Pentecostals he said I preach on cutting hair he said every year you get worse every year you get worse I come back every year and you get worse what about a man preaching the truth and he doesn't see the results it test your temperance it tests your patience I promise you one thing Elisha when he when he called out those she Bears see if he'd had the Holy Ghost in his soul he wouldn't have done that he wouldn't have done that something would have stopped him brother bradam let's take the same case not the exact same case but let's take a case just like that brother Ram looks up in a audience and here's a man a boy and a girl making love up in the up in the balcony he said stop don't do that keeps on going power of God's in the whole building he's Discerning he looks up and he says I told you to stop that then he said something spoke to him and said whatever you say that's what'll happen whatever you say now if we would have been full of a lot of temperance that wasn't good they're disturbing the service this service is got to go on way can't be up there doing that you know what he said he looked at him he said from right here he said he said I forgive you I forgive you remember God told him said if whatever you say they can pack them out dead right he could have said that he said both of you fall dead and they' have both fell dead that would have been the Elijah and Elisha of the Old Testament but not the Elijah of the New Testament oh praise God he had what he had Temperance he had patience he knew they were Sinners he knew they were doing what they were taught to do by their daddy the devil he said I forgive you how many of us would do that don't answer me either me either because I mean you you you get aggravated about certain things you're disturbing the service well just think about that how controlled he was you watch brother R everything was under control even with Jesus everything was under control that's what I and and and I'm getting off a little bit on the over here on the metaling side but you know you take people in the message and they always want a certain kind of of service right right they have their five favorite preachers I'm just going to say it and they have their they want their five they want their results and that's what they get they get their results anything out of that Norm it's like nothing happened we didn't get anything today the spirit of the Lord just didn't move in here I thought the Bible said where the spirit of the Lord is there is wisdom wisdom to discern that yeah something is going on from right here to here from right here to here there's a lot going on I want you to think then you can react later now this right here is not a good reaction but somewhere in between that somewhere in between that like brother George Smith he puts that puts that big old level up there and he says there's a balance we got to have a balance and it is a balance we do have to have that but do not expect God to go by your results he'll go by his own he know knows who needs it he knows who don't need it he's got his own timing we just got to be what brother R say he said it's not he said I just make myself available ain't that what he said I'm waiting on him I'm making myself available for God to step in here and talk to you well praise the Lord that's the way it happens and the Lord God commanded a man s of every tree now we can eat we're talking about eating the tree tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's what we're eating on now but we are eating now of of the tree of life we are eating from that all the way up we are building what is that that's a building we are building something back zerubabel was given a foundation he said and Lord said build that Temple he built it back and who built it back I going ask you a question did did zerubba just look at that and he went uh there's a pile of stones and there's some wood brother Gary's built many houses like this he orders the wood he orders the bricks and he just stands there and goes all right build a house uh no he ain't done that no use people people that were willing to work people that were willing to put a trial in this hand and a sword in this hand build the thing build the wall build the temple and watching out for the enemy a that the way we look ain't that the way it is for us we're building something but we got to watch out for the enemy in the early church watch what happened the false Vine got intertwined with the True Vine it's not like we think it's way over here and you can tell the difference in this one and this one they're intertwined the only thing is is what we talked about this morning it's the maturity didn't Jesus say he said leave them alone in other words leave them alone through all these Church ages they're going to prove in the end whether they're seed or not seed cuz the shu is Pentecost the shu is is now dead the Shu had a purpose it protected the seed but once the Shu pulled away or burst open what come out the seed that's where the life was the life wasn't in the shuck it come through the shuck into the seed that's what we're feeding on today we're feeding on the seed word of God not the Shu word of God everybody with me we're not feeding on the stock word of God now you might be in that stage in your journey but we're not feeding off of that we're feeding off the Flesh of the son of man who is the Flesh of the son of man to end time are you are but it intertwined itself around the True Vine and we find these Deeds of the nickol and that spirit is going to be found look fighting the True Vine until it's destroyed by God that's why brother brand and we need to read it again a word to the church brother B said bind together that's why the Bible says and I'm just going to read it again where the Bible says the more as the day approaches you're supposed to come together more not less come together more why cuz you need to TW intertwine ourself together put our faith together put our faith muscles together what happens when a wolf is looking for you watch some of those shows and you see a leopard or you see the Lions they run through that pack and that Pack's all packed up and all of a sudden one will jump out or either they'll take off if one's got a limp well you know what they don't go after that guy that's running 300 miles an hour right they go after that guy's running 30 m an hour that's the same way the devil is he sees the one that's weak but you know what happens praise God even in nature if it's a calf guess what's going to happen mama's going to turn around that's right and she's going to oh God she's going to run back and say that's my baby take me if you need to but leave my kid alone that's what we ought to say about our kids leave our kids alone devil I know they got out of the past I know they got out somewhere in the wilderness I know they're out there fighting but God don't do don't let them die am go find them amen thirdly add knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge cuz that's foolishness to God what has knowledge done in this end time it's killed more people than it's helped right gunpowder cars hey cars kill more people than anything in the world wars and everything more people dieing auto accidents than anything yet guess what we're going to go get in that missile and drive to the house and we going to have some that's got electric and it's got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and we can let go of the steering wheel and it drives itself yeah do like that Google car did that time it didn't stop I think humans still ought to be driving a car we make enough mistakes as it is but knowledge that don't mean worldly knowledge cuz that's foolishness to God but knowledge to what to judge knowledge to judge you got to look at that Bible and judge whether you can do it or not right that's right you got to look at the message of the hour you got to look at what I'm saying brother Dell all the different ones are saying you got to look at that and you got to judge whether that's right or wrong right that's for you to do that's why this that's why it's a two-way street like the old saying is how do you judge it then if you got Christian knowledge with your virtue which is what power and Faith are the new birth you judge whether the word is right or wrong but when you see that the scripture is not contrad ictory that you can say that and can see that look by the Revelation in other words by the unveiling of God you see the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it that's why brother Brown did not use a Billy Graham or or Roberts or all these great people that went to college went to Bible College to learn how to form your form your message get them right here you know and and Bam in the middle and then soften it up at the bottom I've seen people told me that that's what they do they tell you how to preach think about that one so who's preaching the denomination is preaching cuz you're preaching what the envelope says you're preaching what they tell you to you know but not us that's why brother Ram seventh great education can't hardly understand what he's talking about sometimes we did just why we I got an excuse maybe people in the foreign countries or even people up north got an excuse you and I don't have an excuse we know what maters and ters is we know what a mule is we know what we know what a a corn bed is we know what this we we know that some of them don't even know what that is but we do the only knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith anybody with me and I keep coming back to this cuz I believe this there's a spirit of wisdom that's going to come into this church I'm talking about this church and any other message church is preaching the word of God the spirit of wisdom knowing how to handle things like I said before word to church brother Brown said bind closer together he said don't let Satan get in between you don't let him shoot you with a dart don't let him divide you bring everything together because you know what then then then what's going to happen the flow is going to be much better when it flows like the brother said he likes to preach here why is he liking to preach here he don't have to sit in background for 30 minutes or he doesn't feel see you can I'm up here now and even the ministers that you can feel a certain way you're going and you can feel it it's like it's like it's pushing right brother B right different ones Brothers other brothers not brother there you it it feels like this and guess what you do brother El he's explained it many times you go this way and see that may be God dealing with this one or that may be the devil trying to get you to not go down this way so you're sitting here I mean who needs discernment this day and time just look at faces I got it anyway but the spirit of wisdom there are a group of people I contend this is a group of people that has the spirit of wisdom it will come into the church to what to make known to the church by the revelation of the holy spirit so see that's kind of a three-fold thing it's not just we're just going to have wisdom no by revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living you said BR we know what day we're living we're living in the ni thing now do you really know what day you're living in you're living in a bride day you're living in a day where you got to get up that statue of perfect man well you can say Amen if you want to but I'll say amen that's exactly where we're at time of playing is over with that's right the foolish virgin played that's why they didn't have no oil they played around the wise virgins took oil they knew something was coming they knew because remember they both went to sleep at the same time but they did go to sleep with one full and one empty they were prepared these were not we got to be prepared let's skip on a little bit more 3:30 there's nothing such prevailing power now to me I like to read this again look prevailing power not just listen we have a service and the power of God just like we had not too long ago power of God just swept in the building he just felt when I was standing up here when brother Daryl was here it was like raindrops it was like a tingle just standing there and just feeling it knowing that y'all were feeling it too now see that's a that's a a a but that says prevailing power prevailing power is this your graph don't look like this like your bank account no it's prevailing power it's power that does this right here all the way through doesn't matter doesn't matter if Satan comes out don't matter if the Devil comes at you gives you a headache gives you what doesn't matter if somebody comes along and says oh you're not preach you know that that brother brandham he's just prevailing power it prevails over every bit of that and listen we do have ups and downs but there's a prevailing power that keeps us in the middle there's nothing such prevailing power as a revelation of the word so in this verse three is a blessing pronounced on those who give attention to this book talking about the Bible now that word revelation we were talking about this morning jump to it real quick let's read it just for a second Revelation is the act of pro look all this is emotion God never sets still a revelation is not sitting still a revelation is as brother Ernie said it's dunamus it's power there's no such prevailing power as a revelation you want something to sustain you get a revelation it will sustain you from this and this and this and this and this it's prevailing the actual process of what disclosing something previously secret how many times you come into a service I have to like Brother D said one time he said smart as I am I didn't think of that but how many of you you come into a place and you and somebody bring something out you go wow man I never seen that before well I didn't mean that a brand new book came out that didn't mean that a 67th book of the Bible came out you were reading it the whole time but something was veiled and whose fault was it and mine but it's our fault no it was the devil no it's was me that's right so the act act action or process plan of disclosing something previously secret or obscure especially something true a fact disclosed or revealed especially in a dramatic or a surprising way that aha moment aha that's what that means Christianity and Christianity is God's disclosure look of his own nature is that what we're talking about now and that come from Webster sorry that came from the internet Google I just did it back there a few minutes ago devil wasn't nowhere around that was me God's disclosure of his own nature and look his purpose for mankind his plan for mankind especially through the words of human intermediaries oh sorry guys got to hear it through US Lord something in which such a Divine disclosure osure is contained such as the Bible brother Brown said the prevailing overcoming now look church is built on Revelation so we can expect God somebody say that with me expect God expect God to reveal it to us take God his word sit down say God I don't know what they're talking about I don't know about this adoption but you know what you do you say I don't know about this adoption and then go watch YouTube for 3 hours come on or if if if if Lis was here Netflix sends you a notification that there's a new something on guilty but why don't we get things we don't make ourself available or we make our available to other things but the prevailing overcoming church is what built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal it to us but we can't expect him to reveal it to us like I said reading as Brother D always said G's Almanac you know what that is some of you don't know what that is it's a farmer's calendar to tell you what to grow and what not to grow uh what sign to plan under and what you know if it's going to be a bad winter yeah anyway so that's an almanac they put it together a bunch of old people put it together so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us look however you don't need a revelation on water baptism he staring you right in the face now wait a minute hold on brother brand hold on if 500 people were sitting in this congregation well thousand people 950 of them would have said that ain't right cuz they're trinitarians they were baptized all in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and he just told him he said it's staring you right in the face that's why they did like him Hebrews 513 we'll get I'm going I'm going to get somewhere here I'm going to get to Temperance I'm going to get Temperance for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of rightousness for he is a babe now listen milk will sustain you milk will you know it'll it'll help you live but it won't help you grow but strong meat belongeth to them that are what of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to what to Desert good and evil discern means to what separate make a distinction discriminate I'm sorry God's a discriminator he does not want us to deal with the world he does not want us to go with certain people he wants us to discriminate everybody with me all right that kind of discrimination I'll go with you all right to prefer this is a familiar quote let's read it Christ in the true church now I like what brother Brown talks about the true church there's a false Church the Bible tells you there's a false Church Christ in the true church is a what continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people discrediting of the word we know that we see that I mean when people are like I said before you take you take the ministry of William brandham and you look and you go for 30 something years and and and it goes and progresses like it does through the word of God and through the healing campaign but then into the opening of the word how can you call that false listen Satan can't hold that together God can God held that together with that man he held that together with brother R all through till the day he passed away oh and that's another thing what that little he's a brother what that little brother said about brother brandom not being a good Bible uh teacher basically what he was saying was is that brother brandham was fine until he was preaching Doctrine and then God let him die and I've heard that before dad's heard it too that that that uh brother Brown got to messing around in things he shouldn't have got messing around in you know like the truth of the scripture and and God took him off the scene why would God take somebody off the scene if it was the truth he was just done he was finished with brother Brown he knew if brother Brown stayed around here longer and longer that everybody would just totally look to the man he knows that if the people get the true Revelation so there is a true revelation of the true church true true true and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation what of the two spirits the two intertwined two intertwined knowledge of Good and Evil Tree of Life or then the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit look discern in other words have knowledge and withstand the antich Christ Spirit Satan will be powerless that's enough for me cuz we think he's this great powerful person he's not resist the devil and he'll flee from you resist amen it's like going shopping at Walmart when they got out where's Richard that go shopping at hamr you can resist that thing Old Devil we didn't last night we just had a bad problem last night Walmart had all their hunting gear on sale how I got off of that I don't know he will be be as definitely thed today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over and in the desert what what did Jesus use in the desert no he spoke to him he said Satan is written to not tempt the Lord thy God it is written it is written it is written and what' Satan do he finally had to leave him I want Satan to be so aggravated with me that he'll leave me right hello somebody I want him to be so aggravated I try over here and he's got it blocked I try over here and he's got it blocked I'm talking about he the holy spirit's got him the devil blocked can't get in what that right there h block right here block right here he's already got this block block right here block here block here guess what then devil just plays with your body but you let me tell you something remember when God said if you considered my servant job job said you got a hedge built around him and I can't get to him he said if you'll take that hedge down he said I'll make him curse you to your face God said okay go try so he tried a little bit he come back and he said hey you got a hedge belt around him where was the Hedge the Hedge now was right here cuz he said now you go ahead and touch his body and even in his Spirit realm job's like I don't know what this going on and he's got three friends that are supposed to be his friends I hope y'all don't have friends like them three friends were but remember it was three friends that were what they were accusing him of everything but my when elu come on the scene when number four whenever you walked up being a young man not not being some great something and not even being a friend of job he said job get off stand on your feet I'm going to tell you something that was Jesus Jesus Christ in that man telling job that look job quit looking for all these things I know you're a righteous man I know these things and job got so much a revelation he said oh I know my redeemer liveth in other words I know there's a chance with these other three friends I got I ain't got a chance in the world they called him a secret Center they called him everything in the world but y Hugh said stand on your feet Joe be a man you got it inside of you cuz God's got a hedge around it let it out and job started speaking and them three friends just went off into the rode off into the distance and what did job do he was restored or redeemed back everybody with me on that so virtue knowledge we just talk about knowledge so it's Holy Ghost knowledge you got to discern you're sitting here today like I said before you're Discerning you go home tonight you're still Discerning you get up in the morning go to work you're still discerning so let's go on to knowledge let's go on to Temperance just for a minute just for about five minutes Temperance is what self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites self-control because remember the the meaning and the dictionary is over here on this side that says Temperance is is being able to control yourself from drinking alcohol right brother Brown told us that but he said it's not that kind of temperance he said it's it's controlling your uncontrollable temper over here on this side so self-control it's strong it's robust it has power over don't raise your hand how many of you have mastered that that power yet didn't think so me either but we're working on it we're working on it he's still working on me mastering or controlling or curbing restraining control oneself cuz when you get a temper you're what out of what control you're out of control you can't control yourself but brother R was talking about having that kind of temperance to control yourself control that temper that's in the spirit realm not in your soul it's in your spirit we're talking about Spirit now we're talking about the spirit realm we're not talking about the soul the soul that's inside of you stood one day in the temple come on somebody and he saw him doing something that God that that was that was not right right and he said sat there and he platted a rope but you know what I believe he done while he was plating the Rope he said Lord if they only knew who I was the reason they turned me down is why they're doing that and he platted that rope and guess what he done he didn't walk over there and tap him on the shoulder and ask him to leave the Bible said he drove them out of the temple turned over the tables but he asked us to curb that he asked us to control that and restrain from doing that listen what are you saying you you going to get upset you're going to get upset now when we got upset before the upset came from here and we upseted like he we upseted the uh we turned over the trash can we kicked the whatever brother said whatever whatever was there and usually when we kicked it it really hurt afterwards have you ever hurt yourself being mad come on you raise your hand now have you ever hurt yourself being mad Danny raise your hand Dan thank you brother wasn't that kind of dumb you wasn't hurting to begin with your foot wasn't throbbing but you got mad at somebody else and you hurt yourself that came from God NOP that came from the devil actually that came from you right all right look add Temperance real quick then we'll close we've come to Temperance now you've had Faith first have to have that look he have to have that he never gets away from that Faith you got to have faith you got to have faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue or power to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge which why I is Holy Ghost knowledge now you're going to add Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol you should have started dad and you birth you're not stop drinking while you going up the statue of perfect man if not you need to go back down and start over again because you ain't born again okay no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh what the drinking of the alcohol but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a Tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time somebody speaks cross to you oh my boy a lot of us is going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in his church Read that read it to yourself then we wonder in Lula Church why God's not moving well we're just flat there's nothing going on touch me then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do yes sir brother Brown said add these things add Temperance oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump up and roll up your sleeve not that but talk with Godly love temp oh y'all quiet oh y'all all quiet I'd be quiet too but I got to talk but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says those of you that didn't say Amen you can neither you need to find you another church this one's not this one's not perfect enough for you when you're riled upon look R not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn the stones into bread he could have done it and showed he was God but he had Temperance when they called him belly above he said I'll forgive you for that they pulled handsful of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing when he had a gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with him and so forth they put a rag on his head and around his eyes and HD him on the head and said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had Temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you can't add that cuz it won't add this is what I want to get to right here remember we talked about vulcanize and I tried to explain it I'm going to let Google explain it for you cuz they some real good nuggets in this if you'll be a little spiritual in just a few turn off the natural turn on the spiritual right it won't vulcanize why do brother BR use that word vulcanize he only uses it one time in in the Statue of perfect man never uses it again cuz he's wantan these things to be vulcanized in you it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece a rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron before we get started I want to tell you where that word come from that word come from the god Vulcan he's the god of fire and something else so they called it Vulcanizing guess who started that Mr goodye the one that makes a goodye tires in 1919 or something when they started making tires he went the they went through a vulcanization process which put the the the rubber together and he called it Vulcanizing because it took heat and so heat and fire I think is the the god Vulcan is the god so they called it vulcanization well you learn something if you didn't learn anything else but those of you that were that asleep you didn't learn anything he couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be look flexible yeah open your eyes to that one flexible just like the rubber is and when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it it's real quit and then we'll close I know it's a little bit long but y'all stand outside for 45 minutes to an hour and talk so let's talk about God while we're in here is that okay when your knowledge is like his knowledge I came to do thy will oh God see with the father's word he defeated at every devil Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word will not pass away when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got that right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a manmade halfway South Stu does anybody know what that means us Southerners do I'll explain it later for another day we'll explain it for another day if you got a halfway South step belief or Temperance oh I ought to slap him down but I better not cuz brother so and so see me and I'll get my name put in the paper wait a minute or I'll have my name put on Facebook or Tik Tok or Instagram if Lis is here he could explain what those are God they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can I don't want y y'all reading ahead of me I don't want you to read ahead of me but when you can really look with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man ain't that what Billy Paul said about brother Brown he never could tell who was brother Brown's enemy or who's his friend now you and I are not to that point yet cuz everything we do is conditional in the in the state we're in right now Regina said something bad about me well she turned every light in my house on three or four years ago and I'm still paying the power bill I'm sorry Regina I apologize I really am I apologize Hey listen I'm trying to get I've got this Hey listen I got this pretty cat this thing is so cute I'll show you a pcture of but I had to overcome that cuz I hated cats I'm telling y'all I hated cats there was one good kind of cat and that was a dead one they come to my house they died to lead poisoning I'm sorry that's just the way I was I didn't like cats but I love them now cuz God told me he said that's my that's my nature too that's my animals you leave them alone now he told me that I've never heard much spoken in my brain but that was spoken in my brain that I needed to what work on my Temperance and my patience listen I'll tell you what I'm thinking what are y'all going to do thank you I believe it will but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your face now look Faith now watch this this is why brother Brown used this word vulcanize now listen there was a Webster's Dictionary back then but you had to do this all I got to do is put it in Google and it pops right up science direct explains and I want you to think about this why did he use that word vulcanize right here at Temperance look we're already three virtues up cuz remember it's not a virtue it's not an an ad you add two Temperance he's got up to Temperance and he's wanting us to see something cuz he never mentions it again all right don't you be reading that Mary impact of vulcanization on rubber now this is rubber watch science direct is wake up just a minute and I'll teach you something science direct it's explains that vulcanization changes the physical read this spiritually why did brother brandom say vulcanized he could have said glued he could have said patched put together Stone he said vulcanize it changes the physical properties of the rubber by forcing it to retract right me of course there are mechanical y'all quit reading down that far cheaters you need patience we'll get to that next Sunday of course there are look mechanical methods that can force rubber to retract as well the difference with vulcanization however is that it come on somebody you all need to look at this it retains the original shape of the rubber when vulcanization is performed on rubber the rubber shrinks while retaining oh shrink me Lord amen shrink me where there's nothing left of me sure my physical being is going to be here sure my outside is going to stay here I hope it gets a little skinnier when we get on Weight Watchers but anyway that has nothing to do with our Salvation when vulcanization is performed on the rubber the rubber shrinks while retaining its original shape vulcanization essentially scales down rubber to a smaller size all without deforming are altering its shape in addition to altering its size while retaining its shape vulcanization also protects rubber from future deformation praise God Amen as it shrinks rubber hardens and becomes less vulnerable to deformation it may still deform when exposed to another enough stress but vulcanized rubber won't deform as easily as conventional non vulcanized rubber that's why brother used that word we were non vulcanized rubber now we are vulcanized rubber rubber also becomes harder when vulcanized which subsequently increases its strength and reduces the risk of physical damage well I thought y'all might shout about that but that's all right y'all don't shout about that all okay now I want you to read this right here unlike with thermoplastic that old junk plastic chemical processes the effects of vulcanization are permanent after a rubber praise God after a rubber object or material has been vulcanized it can't be reversed you Rec IE you put these things inside of you it can't be reversed you and him become so one till Satan can't pull you apart don't you want to be that way stand to your feet God bless don't you want to be that way I'm tired of the devil beating on me deforming my Revelation deforming me in in my walk with God but you know what vulcanization is it's not an easy process you got to heat it to almost 300° and pretty much almost melt come on somebody and pretty much melt the material you put it together and then you cool it off and you can't tell one from the other but brother R said now you can't take Rubber and wood or rubber and metal why cuz they're not of the same chemical substance but if you're a child of God come on somebody if you're a child of God and you got God and he Heats you up a little bit and he vulcanized these uh virtues in you sister Regina there's no going back there's no reverse in God there's no reverse inv vulcanization you can't unvulcanized comes one piece and it becomes look it becomes harder and stronger harder and stronger that that's why brother used that word vulcanization is because he knew what he was talking about because back when we did have to vulcanize we had to take patches and put patches on rubber patches on a hole in a tire right for a lot of you that are that are older and what did you do you heated it and it just melted into each other and it was so much that it was stronger than what was before let's be stronger than what we were before let's be we're listen we're all rubber come on we're all rubber we're all human but God's God and if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul if God's rubber your rubber his kind of rubber so let him bring the heat let him bring the heat and melt me into him I don't want to be me no more melt me into him to where when you see rubber if that's God you see me if you see me you see the god you see that rubber there's not a differentiation there's not a Tess It all becomes one and you can't tell the difference let's bow our heads just for a second I know we've been long a little bit but I believe you brought out some pretty good points today and I sure appreciate you sitting and listening but I want to with your heads bowed and your eyes closed if anybody here wants to be vulcanized every head bowed every eye closed if you want to be vulcanized just lift your hand up and say God please venize me from this day forward Lord make me different but make me you Lord that's just a analogy that man has of vulcanization but I believe you put it on a prophet's mind to tell the people that we don't need to just be like you we need to be you we don't need to be be like rubber we need to be that rubber by vulcanization Lord I lift my hands please by the power of the Holy Ghost Let the Fire of God fall in this building Lord and let it burn out every sin and every problem Lord all the situations that we're going through all the sickness the ones Lord on the internet that's watching in I pray Lord that they would lift their hands and Lord they would get something from you father that you would drop down in the quietness and Lord you can do more and quiet than man can do with a lot of noise and father I pray that you would burn us us together bind us together with you Lord and Lord take all these doubts and fears away Lord take all these sicknesses Lord people that are that are dilatory that are that are backslid Lord I pray that you would just fill them with the Holy Ghost more and more just vulcanize us all together in you lord lord just let the fire 300° that's hot but Lord the fire of God is much hotter than that it'll burn a sinner Soul completely out and put the new birth inside Lord I pray that that'll happen today Lord we pour our heart out to you Lord that you'll save our children that you'll save our grandchildren that you'll save our husbands and wives and Lord like I said before backsliders whatever Lord just bring them back into the F father Lord we

use the young kids use the young adults use the older people use everyone ministers and all of us Lord use us more than you've ever used us before Lord send the fire and let it vulcanize us more to you Lord don't let something get in the way Lord let us get out of the way and let us shrink so that you can be one and you can be magnified you can be the preeminent one in our life prophet of God tells us that we're not going don't get anywhere unless we give you preeminence Lord I pray that we'll have that more and more and Lord that we'll be what you want us to be and you not be sad with us and Lord you'll be glad you'll be that tutter that goes back to the father and says oh they're doing what you ask them to do they're growing in Grace and knowledge they're not drinking milk now

would condemn him Lord and that you'll bring it with the sweetness of God down to a low voice and be able to talk as human beings and get things done I know we have to work we have to do these things but Lord I pray that it'll be done in sweetness that it'll be done in sincerity and Lord that that our sister will come back with a report that things have changed in that office Lord you control

[Music] car is [Music] Jesus the prince of peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father your father my father rubber to rubber let's vulcanize with him cuz you know what when you vulcanize there's nothing in between cuz it all becomes one our problem is is we let that little air of Doubt or a little bit of you know when we had to vulcanize if you'll remember well you had to clean that P you had to clean that piece of rubber off if it was any little piece Speck of dirt it wouldn't vulcanize cuz you got a different substance between but I love that song nothing between my soul and my savior nothing when you get that thing cleaned off like today we got it cleaned off now let God 300° 3,000 de let him burn that out of us and then vulcanize us right together and let us be the people that we're supposed to be walk with God don't walk with the devil walk with God in your life give him first preeminence and I'll promise you I'll promise you he'll have to come on the scene cuz you'll have to do what the word his word says he can't do something different than what he promised he can't you just got to hold on when we get to Temperance we get to patience that you got to hold on hold on patience with God first [Music] M no no no anything between those two pieces of rubber wouldn't work see you couldn't you couldn't put like you couldn't fill the tube full of air number one it had a hole in it but number two it was deformed and you couldn't you had to get all the air out somebody say Amen you got to get Sanctified you got to get cleaned and set aside for service then vulcanize and put you in service then there's nothing man our dad he used to take that he'd take sandpaper and all kind of stuff and he'd he'd do that and he'd rub it off and he'd take that patch and he'd he'd take U the U the glue then back then you can't buy that now because well they were sniffing it but the glue sorry they were they the chemical in that glue would catch on fire so you'd rub that glue right Don you'd put that glue on there and and you take a you take a match and you hit that but he go and it burn just a pretty blue flame it just just burn burn till it got hot then you took the patch and you did the same thing and then you went and you just held it there for a little while you didn't go ahead you didn't pump the you didn't pump the tire up right then right you waited till it every bit got vulcanized to where no air could get out to where Satan can't get in and God can't get out and that patch was Stronger because you really would never have a hole there ever again you have a hole in the in the original rubber tire somewhere else but that that's double that's two pieces of of of rubber together right brother so you and I may get a hole every once in a while somewhere else but guess what go back through that vulcanization process and let the fire of God burn that thing out of you you love the Lord man I love God more and more every day because I look and you and and you see more of him somewhere in what you do and we have faults and failures we have junk that we that we U fall off the wagon every once in a while you might say but not like the world does but we just kind of get dilatory and we kind of get to where we don't think about things of God I same same here but let's always make sure we come back to the place we were come back to the place we were brother Brown said brother Brown said uh told the story about the about the soldier he was dying older man he was dying and the priest run to him and said said what what can I do what can I do and somebody said well uh the thought came to the to the priest's mind to the preacher's mind he said he said hurry son go back to where you left God you know what the soldier said now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take he had left him as a young kid but you know what he found him he went back to the spot come back every one of us come back to the spot where where we left him he didn't leave us we left him remember remember his mama and daddy left him for three days but where was he he was in the temple doing what you're supposed to do they the ones that lost him brother Brown said they lost him at Pentecost H so that's where they lost him at they lost him at Pentecost it was the Feast of Pentecost it's why they were in Jerusalem and Jesus was there in the temple at 13 years old confound in the scholars why because he had knowledge he had knowledge and that's the same knowledge listen let this mind be in you can we believe that let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus let this mind be in you just like the mind of Christ Christ that means you got to think like him yeah that's what it says Paul says we have the mind of Christ The Good the Bad the human part is going to be the bad but God's never going to be bad to you he's going to give you the desire of your heart if you'll ask him as mom said today she was looking for some stuff and found it just like that we were looking for some tables last night or they were for to put in office to put a new print her on and and they didn't have nothing and all of a sudden two seconds later mom said mom said you know ask for big things so she said Lord we need table well God just rolled about six of them out on the from Goodwill they rolled them out from the back right there all right Richard jumped on them kept anybody else from buying them he just laid across them said Don't Touch This leave little Temperance no patience but a little Temperance so we got them for like 30 bucks I mean we asked not I mean we have not because what we ask not you say ask for tables why not why not ask for those things amen I don't know if I well guess what brother Brown said he said why ask for little things he said asked for big things H got yes oh yeah they got the T the tables are here they're not here but they're home but got got what to ask for so he's a prayer answering God if we'll just ask him and not ask him a miss not asking because of our own our own for our own self- gain but to help somebody else you just ask God ask God just keep asking him just keep asking him keep asking him somewhere that somewhere it's going to match when we get all these things out of our life something's going to fall in place and I'll promise you you going to have your kids you're going to have your wife you're going to have your if you really believe that you'll have the desire of your heart you will I'm not going to
