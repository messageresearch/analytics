========================================

thank you brother Joe's got all the my notes from last uh the last time so if you want to print them out or anything Joe all right last time we were on verse six and the Lord said in the cane wire that Roth and why is that counting was falling if thou do us well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and underneath shall be his desire and thou shalt rule everything so just to recap we started talking about how the devil will put things in your path when you want to be saved when you want to be healed and this is one of the things that you when you want to be to when you're seeking the Holy Ghost then put in your path that something in your past is keeping you from being from receiving the holy ghost or your genealogy so we talked about um we went through lots of different people in the Bible that do not have uh the best genealogies and I just found this quote last night that I wanted to read and talked about whether or not Cain could be saved I'll read this real slow because this is such a good quote that's in the token paragraph 357. now if you I'm gonna do this a long quote so I'm gonna read it and I'll tell you when I'm getting to the good part now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then in Hebrews 12 24 start reading he's talking about how the blood of Jesus speaks better things in the blood of Abel in Hebrews 10 12 to 4 said the blood of Jesus speak of better things than that available see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had spoke and cried out the Justice blood of evil cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out he redeemed amen better things now here comes get ready pay attention it makes you sons and daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide cane see but the blood of Jesus can amen amen so old Cain come out today if you've been a persecutor against the word and say days of Miracles has passed this thing is all nonsense and things is crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ Cries Out but there is forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it wish we could stay a little while on that see blood speakers better things the blood of Jesus Christ has been covered from all sins and you know God gave Canaan promise and he's giving us a promise too that if he said if he that comes to me all in no wise cast out if you come to him you don't have to worry about your genealogy or the things that your parents did or anything if you have a desire come and you can receive it huh and I think last time we talked about um if thou do it's not well same life at the door underneath shall be his desire because um a Christian is God washes out for the Christian puts it puts us over the bill let's see let's go to verse 8. and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel's brother and slew him now last time we went through John chapter eight and looked at the conversation that Jesus had with the Pharisees and uh if you if you put two and two together we know Kane talked with Abel and then Kane got really upset so just putting two two together we know I I believe that the conversation was able to own King's revelation and you know it's still true today when somebody an unbeliever a lot many times they see your Revelation or hear your experience with God and they uh let's turn the numbers 14. because uh there's this is the story of today's Cornelia and there's a little detail in here that a lot of people usually when you tell the story you remember about Joshua and Caleb uh coming back and they testified that we can take the land and all the other all the others did uh there's no way we can take the land that ties in with what came to Abel see let's start at verse one let's just read the whole story chapter 14 of Numbers verse 1. and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people whipped that night and all the children of Israel murmur against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them with God that we had died in the land of Egypt with God we had died in his wilderness I'm wearing four hath the Lord brought us into this land follow my sore that our wives and our children should be afraid we're not better for us to return unto Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Heir and fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jafana which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they speak I think about this they've been they've told their revelation we can take the land just like Abel told his revelation and they're speaking to all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceedingly good exceeding good land if the Lord delighted us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which floweth with a milk and honey only Rebel not you against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they have bread for us their defense has departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not here's what came to the table but all the congregation babes Stone them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel so they just didn't say I don't believe it they were ready to kill them um so let's read um let's look at a few cloaks that brother Brandon said about this conversation and what Cain did in the mark of the beast 1961 he said now we find out that the calls that Cain listened to the enemy then what happened he become the first murderer he become the first one that had jealousy let me skip down and see came by taking on this evil took the first Mark God marked him no one was to kill him let him alone but you remember as soon as he marked him he went out from the presence of God hold on to that now no one was to kill him and if you look at it we'll we'll go down through all the stories of uh people that have been marked but you look at that kides Barney they didn't it was just Moses and Joshua and Caleb and they didn't tell everybody else to get out they still stayed with him for 40 years and went through the Wilderness that weren't excommunicated unless we'll see what brother Brown says about that in just a second and I will restore saith the Lord he said that's true certainly God is the only Creator but through the spirit that he let come upon him that's why candy did what he did because of the spirit that he let he allowed he accepted Satan's life you couldn't attach that evil thing of Cain upon God where did he get that nature he had to be jealous from Satan his father the Jehovah Jireh and what is a sinner a man that drinks a man that commits adultery what is a sinner an unbeliever no matter how religious you are and how holy you are that has nothing to do with it you're Holiness would nothing like come up to the Pharisees and Sadducees and Jesus said you are your father the devil and the works of your father you'll do he that believeth not is condemned already and every unbeliever must go to hell so what makes you a child of the devil no matter how many Sensational outfits are you must be born again 1961. no matter how many Sensations you have still a child of Satan until you become dead to the world and alive in Christ listen quickly now in Luke 16 13 that I'll just read it real quick no servant can serve two masters for either who will hate the one and love the other else he will hold to the one and despise the other he cannot serve God and Mammon in First John 3 9 10 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and cannot sin because because he's born of God and this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever did not do without righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother now let's move on down to chapter to verse 9. said unto King where is Abel thy brother and he says I know y'all am I My Brother's Keeper well that's another way of saying aren't you my brother's people which is just unbelievable the rationalist that he had and furthermore he didn't know he committed a sin and that sin led to another sin that he told a lie right and uh I was I found this this really good quote that irenia said um he wrote this uh he wrote a big book called against heresies when uh when he was alive see and he said and he was not soft he's talking about this verse and he was not softened even by this nor did he stopped short for that evil deed but being asked for his brother was he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper extending and aggravating his wickedness by his answer if it is a wicked to slay a brother much worse as it does insolently and never ever irrelevantly irreverently to reply to the omniscient God as if he could battle him and for this he did himself very curse about with him because he gratuitously brought an offering of sin having had no reverence for God nor being put to Confusion by the act of fracture side franchise Killian brother and sister so he's he's not concerned at all for his soul the verse 10 and he said what has thou do in the voice of thyroid blood cries unto me from the ground and we knew about Hebrews 12 24 that says unto Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant into the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that available so let's compare the two what the two uh what what Abel's blood and Jesus was said well you know the blood is just chemistry it doesn't speak what speaks is the life behind the blood the Abel's blood spoke he cried out for justice they came and killed him but Jesus blood identifies us with him and speaks forgiveness speaks perfection and the token brother random said how can the chemistry speak it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking the soul that was in King and cried out or enable it was a life that was in Christ that cries out better things than any it speaks and it speaks loud it's the Holy Spirit it speaks plain it tells us that the time is here when we see it where it said it would say it and then we see it come back and identify what it said there's nothing else left but to believe it that's right to receive it and also in the token he he talks about this a lot we find out the blood does speak it speaks in your behalf the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood amen oh brother I wish everybody could see that see if you can see what it is the life that's in you see that blood is identifying you with it it's the token what it is the blood was shed for you you've accepted and the life that's coming to you you have the token that's the Holy Spirit Paul tells us that the blood speaks that anyone knows the blood is actually itself can't speak it's a chemistry is that right how many knows that but how many knows that the blood speaks what about your brother said his blood cries from the earth against you is that right his blood is a speaking God said what about him he said am I My Brother's Keeper said his blood is crying out his blood isn't crying out it's a token it's a token that he had been killed his blood was crying out against him and then also in the token was the one that I just read about uh it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God the blood of Abel cannot hide Kings even the blood of Jesus can now let's look at verse 11. okay and now are thou cursed from the Earth which hath opened her mouth to receive that Blood Brothers blood so he's cursed from receiving any benefit and enjoying the fruits on the Earth uh in the next verse and we'll see how he's cursed from even having any kind of settled being able to enjoy just a peaceful life let's look at that verse 12. when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her feet her strength fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in the Earth and he gave him it's an addition to Adam's curse if you go back to Genesis 3 17. he said that curse was to Adam he said because I was talking into the voice of thy wife and that's eating of the tree for which I commanded these things thou shall not eat of it curse it is the ground that I say can sorrow shall I eat of it all the days of my life in addition to that now all the ground's not gonna um yield unto thee her strength and this was particular to Cain because he was that was his occupation with a farmer in verse 13. and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear and it seems like he got off pretty easy for killing his killing his brother Kane's not really so much interested in his own salvation he's interested in how bad he's gonna get punished he's actually complaining about the mercy of God we mentioned earlier about um sitting away your day of Grace and this is another thing that the devil will kind of throw in your way so let's read some quotes about you know Kings Kings crossing the line and what happens when you cross the line is you just you don't really care sweet roast fruit or brown said about it and it misses expectancy 1953 he's talking to somebody coming through the prayer line he says howdy do sir now there's something strange about you sir Satan has desire to take your life you are all tore up you think you send away your day of Grace you think your life is ruined do you love Jesus what makes you love it before there could be anything to their make you love him there has to be a Creator to create the love in your heart is that right if you'd send away your day of Grace you would hate Jesus but you love him and you're all right and the devil's just lying to you you're nervous come here and I'll cast him away for for you if you'll believe do you believe it he prays for him and he says now you're all right now you can raise your head feel all right now son is that all right the Devils you have committed suicide in a few days that was on his mind he thought he'd send away his day of Grace when he come up for real black heavy like a fog meeting me in the face that's devils the boy is free now I feel happy go on home rejoicing thanking God for his goodness to you God bless you and the Waters of separation he's talking about a a young girl that buried a husband and started drinking and uh he said I said look do you still have respect for the Lord Jesus she said I do sir I said then he hasn't left you I said no he's still got Mercy for you said you you think he'd receive me like right like this I said yes ma'am I took her by the hand knelt down there that place brother we brought that place up into a prayer meeting and he led her to the Lord Jesus yes speak to the Rock he said listen these churches and things as having a form of godliness but denying the power of the Earth find out they go in there it's not a natural death that's a spiritual death a natural death is not very bad but a spiritual death being separated and cut off from God send away their day of Grace went over and looked out said a bunch of Holy Rollers don't pay any attention to that Devil's in the football that sure is the world certainly so Cain was at a place where he just didn't care anymore number so let's look at verse 14. behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from that face I shall I be here and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the Earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now when it says from thy face shall I be healed he's not talking about from the uh from God knowing anything about him obviously but just from the favoring the will of God and from fellowship with him and I shall be a fugitive in my back and a vagabond in the Earth you know again he's more afraid of uh a natural death than any concerned about his soul and brother random in the mark of the beast and the Seal of God he said the mark of the beast a Wonder refugitive don't know where he's going don't know where he's where he what he knows don't know what he doesn't want he's a fugitive just somebody wondering let's go to the verse 15. just keep on and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever saith came Vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him and you know you can follow this Mark all the way to Revelations where Revelations 13 it says and he calls with all the small and great reason for free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead and then no man might buy ourselves they've either had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name and the Oneness of unity brother random said what is the mark of the beast unbelief the mark of the beast and the Seal of God 1961 said a mark is a distinction it makes a difference it separates something but like you say you got one Mark against you to mark but you never said you had one seal against you you got one Mark against you and the seal is a sign of ownership a Mark it's a distinction when the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing his ownership God owns the church the mark of the beast is the way with the outcasts that refused to take and come God's provided away Kane as soon as he was marked was sent away to death the mark of the beast and the still of gods paragraph e69 he said he that sins what is sin unbelief you turn your back on God what do you do then steal yourself away and take the mark of the beast and go off like Cain did for the presence of God come right up to the borderline and then don't believe it you believe it but you're scared to take it you get that sentence willfully just believe willfully after he's received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God the mark of the beasts and the Son of God are E71 now after this night it's on your hands eat it will just believe it willfully after he has received knowledge of the truth seeing the angel of the Lord coming proving everything at the last day seeing the Everlasting gospel being preached by Luther sanctification by Wesley and all the gospel and he'll warning you against Marky and don't turn away come up close to Christ you say now brother Branham that's the mark and this uh when he when he marked King nobody wants to kill him and you can find this uh this kind of thing laid him alone all through the Bible like in uh Hosea chapter 4 17 where Ephraim the tribe of Ephraim went into idolatry and the scripture says that Ephraim is married to his idols leave him alone in Romans 12 19. dearly beloved Avengers not yourselves but rather give place at the Wrath for his written benches his mind I will repeat saith the Lord you remember when the the uh Peter and the other Apostles and disciples were discouraged in the in the temple he said we thank God because we're allowed to suffer the thing the afflictions except for the same reproves that our Lord did they didn't roll back just because somebody treated them poorly or talked talked about the gospel Proverbs 20 22 say not thou I will recompense evil but wait on the Lord and he shall save thee we're almost 12 17 recompense no man for evil provide things honest and the side of all men and uh one story that I think really illustrates this is the story of David and shimmy in second Samuel chapter 16. a lot of times the story has the Bible has so many good stories that illustrates these points a lot of times it just helps too second Samuel chapter 16. let's start at verse five and when King David came to her own behold fence came out of a man of the family of the House of Saul whose name was shimmy the son of Guerra he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast Souls of David and all the Servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left and this says to me when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of Belial the Lord hath returned upon me all the blood of the House of Saul and who stead the ice rain and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son then behold Thou Art taken and I Mischief because thou art a bloody man this is the center of zero I unto the king why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his head and the King said what have I to do with you you sons of zero why so let him curse because the Lord has said unto him cursed David who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and David said to abishad had to always servants behold my son which came forth out of my mouth seeketh my life how much more now may this Benjamin do it let him alone and let him curse for the Lord has been him let him alone that whole thing is Through the Bible and somebody curses you to leave them alone and uh let's see what brother Brown said about the discernment of spirit about this story did you notice when David was rejected as king he went out of the city and a little Benjamin Benjamin which was supposed to have been a brother to him should have been sorry because he was convicted but what he was a crippled man and he drugged along there with his crippled condition throwing dirt on David and calling him all kinds of bad names and cursing him in the name of the Lord cursing King David in the name of the Lord this little old crippled up benjamite watch the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil working the spirit of the devil would walk to cut his head off but not the spirit of God I'm deserving the spirit in paragraph four to watch the spirit of Christ and David let him alone for the Lord has told him to curse me do you catch that let him alone the Lord has told him to curse me but then when David returned in glory I mean it returned to his his position of powers like our Lord will return then brother when I said uh that little dirt thrower fell on his face and begged for mercy when the Judgment came let him alone the spirit of Christ in us don't excommunicated let's remember that all these things has got to come to pass we've got one thing to do move on God promised that he'd make everything work together for good to him that love him let's keep the deserving of spirit keep the objective right we're here to serve God each one fellowship and going along and serving God if the man's got the wrong kind of an object objective then what will happen and that's probably a good stop and play for today thank you
