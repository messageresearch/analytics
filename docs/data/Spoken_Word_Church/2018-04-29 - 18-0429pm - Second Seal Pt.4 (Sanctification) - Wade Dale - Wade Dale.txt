the moment good to have each and every one of you here today Lord bless your heart bless your effort it was an effort to get up and come to church you had to overcome something something the devil sure didn't want you to come so you overcame him hey man devil they want you to be here today so you overcome that that's enough happy birthday buddy knowing you for a long time I remember when I graduated high school 1978 did give me $5 $5 bill hey in 1978 $5 was a miracle but to come from him was a double miracle we just all kind of grew up and got all together had me but I can remember that I can't remember nobody else give me anything but I remember brother dick gave me five dollars it was just a shock I guess good to be in it huh 40 yeah I know our 40th anniversary of our graduation we got to go I got to go want to get finished here and we got to get all that stuff straightened out ready to go for 40 years Lord you were still 42 years old 40 years ago in the doses I figured that $5.00 I figured that $5.00 came from you period not here okay yeah I figured okay well was I smart was I did you not tell her you gave me top dollar did you not tell her that you get oh she okay she that's what I figured anyway so y'all made it through 40 something years later so you didn't the Lord brought you through that five dollars he he doubled it tripled it quadruped little bit and that's right that's right absolutely and I believe that never seen it fail never saying fair you can't outgive God he can do more with our ten with ten percent and we can do with ninety hey man so you don't have to worry about that so if you got your Bibles or you want to follow along let's turn the revelations and get started before we get started Joyce said she forgot to put in a prayer request at Terry mote which is her oldest brother is having open heart surgery Wednesday so just keep them in your prayers this week some of you I don't know if anybody in here but boy people go through the open-heart surgeries it's rough on the spirit a lot of times more than it is on the on the body so I just keep him many prayers he's a lord he's probably 70 how much seventy one unit gracious we need to get out of here well get no I I'm gonna tell you when he was just a boy so let's go to Revelation six and we won't get started on the second seal again everybody all right say man all right remember we will junior now dad announced we were gonna be a brother Chris Long's we're flying out Friday and we'll be flying back late Monday night so keep us in your prayers we're gonna do a little tour of the Grand Canyon we've never been there before so brother Clarence lives a convenient 30 minutes from there so we're gonna go and we're gonna go to Sedona on Sunday evening after we get finished ministering for him so we kind of put in a little vacation time and there's a commercial beekeeper out there and we're gonna get to visit with him too so it'll all be we'll all be a good time just keeps any prayer so we'll be going next Sunday and Bob will be doing Sunday school and if any of you want to I'm going to do a sit I'm doing a series on the book of Romans downstairs and Sun Tzu class and we're gonna take the book of Romans and we're gonna break it down and go scripture by scripture so if you want to join us you can join us then we'll be doing that for a while down in sunday-school class so just keep sitting in prayers it just came to my attention that the book of Romans is sectioned into several sections one would be justification and one is sanctification so it's going to tie in right with what we're all talking about I was telling a class this morning I cannot for the life of me see how somebody can say that I always was eternal that I just came to this knowledge that I always was now listen we're coming to the knowledge that that inside of us always was but how are you gonna fit justification and sanctification what are you gonna do with bringing the Holy Ghost what are you gonna were you going to put that to me that just that just zeros out the Bible the Bible is for my Redemption and it's because I got lost right I got lost and then God found me but I got lost so I lost something a loss coming the way I should have come but now that we come to this realization and seals now that we'll see that yes it that there's a there's a part of God always followed you the whole time of your life but he wasn't in you he wasn't in you he but he was following right along and when you come to meet the word boom there comes same way with Paul Paul could not persecute those Christians and have any kind of eternal life in his soul or in his being at all because bride can't persecute bride he couldn't make those Christians blaspheme and him be standing there with any kind of eternal know he had representation though because that's what God God was just waiting says okay Paul I'll get you you got to go to Damascus first but I'll get you and you're going to respond and then you're going to turn around from all that and you're going to put people in the kingdom not put them you know try to kick them out of the kingdom so you know that's the same way with with us that Paul's conversion is no different ours I persecuted Christianity you said not by not being a Christian I persecuted Christians by not being one by living a contrary life to God amen so my conversion was just like Paul he knocked me down on my road to Damascus he knocked you down on your road to Damascus a man and you know what did I do I didn't go back to the world to find God Paul didn't go back to gamellia to find God he was sent to a brother that was already born again that had to life in him so that he could pray for Paul and then Paul could be quickened to life that's the way and I just see that I was telling them to Sunday School class that way I don't have to deny anything I can take the whole Bible Genesis to revelations I can take the whole Bible I know I was lost I just don't I to me to deny that it's just to didn't I what Christ came today just and and now I know we do come to a realization that we always was eternal that part of us was the word always was eternal and you were a part of that but we got lost that's why they call it a fall we fell from something alright we'll get started in just a minute revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads do heavenly Father we pray today that you'd be with us not as a bystander but Lord to be the active participant in the service you take over Lord the hearing the speaking as we said this morning Lord now let's listen to what the Spirit says to the churches either has an ear let him hear we're here Lord to hear from you father not from an individual or one person but Lord we're here to hear from you father the person the Lord Jesus Christ everyone else is unworthy but you are worthy and now through you you've made us all worthy father forgive us of our sins bless us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father be with the ones that are not here the ones that are traveling ones that are sick Lord just bless them take care of them we ask these things in Jesus name Amen now the seal revelation six we really the last time a couple of weeks ago you know we really didn't get into it but world will try to get into a little bit more today and I saw him when the lamb had open one of the seals and I heard it was a noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him beheld a white horse he was selling him out of bow and a crown was getting given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which was the Ox say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given him that set thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading this word you got that brother's name brother Danny and I came to a great revelation last weekend we are too old to play softball I think he might have had to stay out of work I didn't but I sure felt like I could have here little older than me that's right just a little though not much but we you know once working once that was revealed I ain't got to ask no more questions I'm done right that's what Danny said the other night is that they said they'd one thing for sure I ain't playin no more softball but we got then tried to act like kids and something that don't work out very good it actually really didn't work out well at all a lot hobbled around for a week and somebody oh boy huh still hobbling about got over mine almost but you never know you could you get old now where you sneezing something goes out a joint so tell me about okay well it's the truth into him so but you know what we're heading toward something we're heading towards something because this is look to be honest this is the fall what we're looking at you go back and look at your pictures twenty years ago and then look at it now you know something fell either you belly or you eyes or your mouth or you know something that ain't in the same place he used to be so but remember that thing inside of you though never got a do never got one second old it is eternal and it's what God saw and you know what if he saw it he's gonna have come to pass I don't have to worry about it he's gonna make it come to pass because that's his word his word said this is what's going to happen and you know what you know our connection is believing I was telling the son just good class downstairs I said look we do we we have to be a believer because we did not see most of us didn't even see brother Branham much less I never saw Jesus on the cross I never saw an empty tomb now dad went to a tomb but taste three or four tombs they say which one they could have stole the body you understand what I'm saying so we have to be a believer in something that we we don't even can't say Amen but now Jesus told us if we go back in the Bible though and he says the world won't see me no more but you will see me for I'll be with you even in you so the world's gonna see Jesus Christ through you and I and that's why we're that's why the word Redemption as we're going to pull up again Redemption means to what bring us back to a place to where Adam Adam and Eve were in the garden and had perfect harmony with God that's the same thing these seals go and pull that up if you want to just one more time just kind of give us a a refresher course because I we need to see the plan of redemption we need to see the full plan of redemption not just one like what you know brother Dale so much justification I was telling them downstairs amen justification is chopping off you past sin but when you come to this justification that we just got finished talking about then we realize that we must believe that that person inside of us did not do that did not do that one time that Genesis 1:26 man never sinned today because that's a piece of God amen that's it that's why Adam could be the lesser gone cuz he had gone in him working with no flu stopped up with no hindrance Jesus didn't get have to get up every day and say am i God today you know probably in the body he didn't feel like it a lot of times but he knew who he was and he knew that his work was not going to be in just that one body he knew he was going to come back and come into our body cuz that's what he wanted because remember nice thinking the other day you know Jesus standing on earth he said before Abraham was I am so what the mind that was in Christ was God okay he's like I found brother join him the other day kind of getting off the subject but I think I'm gonna stay on this just for a few minutes but Jesus when he got up when he got got up to adulthood see your problem and my problem is is I'll promise you one thing every human you see since you were a child till the day you pass on are we going to rapture we were all born in the same way rich poor big short fat ugly doesn't matter we were all born one way and we hold to that old nature because I came from my mom and daddy hey man see Jesus when he walked on earth he didn't have that he didn't have that carnal mind he didn't say I act this way because he didn't have nobody to pull him back to except who the Father that was in him the father that was in he was Almighty God so it's why he could say before Abraham was I am in other words I can remember now this is Jesus Jesus standing there you know hey I can remember when me and Adam walked in the Garden of Eden Jesus Christ was a tree of life folks it's not to people I think another day you know what do you think about when the Bible tells us that Christ came back in the form of the Holy Ghost no what do you think it's not a it's not a puff of our sheep blowing in the wind it's a person the Holy Ghost is a person it's the same man that walked on the face of the earth just take away the flesh body but being able to take away the flesh body he could get in your body amen so the Holy Ghost is not a no it's a person it's the same man in another form so that he can divide itself listen Jesus couldn't divide itself he was one man he couldn't divide itself as much as he wanted to help everybody in the world here's no way he could divide itself and get into the people so they can understand what he said he said but you go up to Jerusalem and you wait to be endued with power from on high because I'm going to come back not into one I'm going to go into 120 at one time then 3,000 and then several million ever how many million they are but the breaking of the seals then is not necessarily for the soul the soul was redeemed by whole I just say about the new birth by the shed blood of Jesus Christ but we'll bring full fellowship into manifestation our problem is it's what we were talking about last Sunday or 74 left is the flues now the inside man God Himself inside of you does not need Redemption he is the Redeemer okay so he's inside of you so who needs redemption that old Adamek nature that's attached to you in your spirit realm that's what needs I will just read and sister Shepherds dream again we're brethren with something like the trash let me read this real quick blasphemous names he's given the interpretation this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does balls it up balls the trash out none of your soul we must believe that your soul your soul doesn't need anything at the moment that's not the only problem is it's encased in all this junk that we are right it's like a capsule you know you you got medicine inside the capsule but until you take your capsule ain't gonna do you no good until what until that capsule dissolves until that capsule dissolves that medicine insides not gonna do you any good so to me that's what the breaking of the seals is it shows you that you are eternal but we're still here and there's a place we have to come to a full Redemption I got some quotes I may read them a couple of Sundays from now where brother Brian was talking about Luther and Wesley Park they had Park yeah they had part they had their part which was a fullness of their time but it only put them in a place of what their soul was redeemed by the new birth the what the age that we're coming into now which would be the fourth age which would be Columba it was it was coming out of that Nicean council all these doctrines were heading in father son Holy Ghost Trinity all that was heading into that age if you didn't believe that they killed you just like I showed and just like we're in Matthew Matthew 24 he talks about what I read it real quitting then we'll get back to it and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet you were thinking that church age that 4th church age you would think those people in that age thought the world was coming to the end sixty-eight million so you know they heard from another and heard from another and heard from another that hey if you say you're a Christian you're dead so they figured the world was coming to an end but the Bible says no it's not coming to an end what the quart of wheat had to go down in the ground just like my brother nails done about two for combat beef or in the for one for eat it down for combat beasts brought it back up so they in this fourth church age that had to go down into the ground after Nicaea everything went what there was a suppression there was a dark time on the earth because what remember the next seal that we get into is going to be white color black it's going to lap over into these ages but remember what we're talking about now is read the Red Horse but when you go to the Black Horse now it's not so much physical death man's ideas got in and killed the people in Martin Luther and John Wesley's age and then with spiritual death not so they went to the physical death in this for church age but that doctrine that started at 6:06 it came and it kept eating and kept eating in it it's still eating we think well no that was backed in denominations are still have the Trinity still alive the eternal hell is still a lot that's all still alive that's what I mean these horse riders they're still riding they have not been conquered now they got to be conquered in you they got to be conquered in you cuz that to me is the whole point to these seals now seeing your soul is conquered it's done it's finished I want us to see that when you wake up in the morning you're just as eternal as God is in the soul when you go through a bad day you're still just as eternal as God is in your soul when you have a good day you're still eternal as God is in your soul and then so were you having a bad day not in your flesh your flesh your flesh is just getting old and wearing out right knee that hurt to do that but now that spirit guy that's the one that we live in 100% of the time I said 100% time cuz this 99.99999 we let God brother direct pop up every once in a while I'm sorry but that's our problem because when Adam got up in the morning he knew who he was and he just went right Hey look he didn't have a quote book he didn't have so and brother stone so he could call and get some encouragement he went straight to God if he needed anything he said God in other words in other words just like the Bible says before you asked what he say God said are in you you'd ask me already got it ready for you don't you think that's right and with Adam soon as Adam thought it garden you had already thought it so he'd give it to him that's what you and I got to come to because listen God's always wanting to fellowship with you in flesh always that was his intended plan it's to fellowship with you in flesh you as a person you as an individual he wants to fellowship with you in your flesh you say how do you know that so that's what we're going to an eternity to do so in this age of sanctification we got to see let's go to Revelation let's go to the first quote Revelation chapter 5 we've read these before we'll read them over again see it's these seals opening up but just beginning to reveal the plan of redemption how he did it it's all over now just about just about finishing up so we're at the end so that's one of the things are being revealed that's why I took a profit in the last days last age to bring all this together hey look Martin Luther yes he came to sanctification but he wasn't sanctified as you an hour I mean we can't drink him I don't want to drink a beer but you see what I'm saying his desire was not that deep but God was pleased to dwell in Martin Luther because he took that piece of the word to just shall live by faith I've been studying the book of Romans and do you know that Martin Luther's favorite one of his favorite books of the Bible was Romans because it talks about justification the just shall live by faith he quotes it several times in the book of Romans so I'm gonna read through that and read some of Martin Luther's commentary about that but see that was his message just shall live by faith john wesley you gotta live a sanctified life clean and set aside for service and then the pentecost come in with the Holy Ghost but now see and I don't like to say we're beyond that or above that but we have to be in a progression we do have to be above that because none of that works for us just just living a sanctified life it's the worst thing you can do my brother now saying you read Ezekiel you get a new spirit of sanctification the prophet of God said so you can what live with yourself so the unclean spirit goes out come here for singing you're gonna be an unclean spirit okay stand behind me all right give me a hand all right the unclean spirit goes out of a man cool the unclean spirit goes out we'll see who's left me I'm still here me my persona Who I am what I'm doing is still right here that in clean spit unclean spirit is dripping out Lord I can't deal with this cigarette smoking anymore whatever you want to call it because you know some of us didn't have problem with that some of us did some of didn't I did other things so what name your demon huh zach is my date no but that unclean spirit goes out well there's nothing there but you right now you get where God what does he do he brings a spirit that's what the ezekiel says you watch brother branham he says he god gives you a spirit of sanctification that show you can deal with yourself and then another quote he says where that God can start dealing with you because what God can't come closer when you got this demon inside of you God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so he's got to get rid of the unclean spirit some of y'all are like this I got rid of him I got rid of him I really didn't I got rid of him no I got rid of him God got rid of him for me but it was by the washing of the word and then the word came and washed what the trash sorry man you were just sitting up front the trash the trash out but now look that's cleaned and set aside the glass is clean but he liked me he liked being in here he was he had fun man we had all kind of fun you know we did things together so he comes back and he attaches itself to me again but you know what I let him I let him back in even though I was given a spirit of sanctification because that's what happened to Judas Judas if the unclean spirit went out of Judas healed the sick raise the dead right but what happened whatever that spirit was that left Judas see he likes coming back you see smiling see you like you notice he likes it see that's what that devil does that then was going I'll be back in a little while right but now what if he comes here and whatever a void that was in me is filled with God that's the Holy Ghost because see when the unclean spirit goes out of a man washing drunk places seekest read find us know what he doesn't it's kind of like a baby being born man this thing's been worn for nine months and it's been all good now all of a sudden I'm cold you know sorry that's what he's doing he's after going I don't understand if you don't keep that thing washed out keep it clean he's going to come back and attach yourself and he's going to be worse because he's going to bring seven of his other friends and they're all gonna be smiling like that but that's it that's what sanctification does it now you say well what about in them in the seals when I see in the sanctification in the seals this guy's not anywhere in my soul he has moved to the second man he can't get in my soul anymore if I'm born again but he does have access because I was born in sin shaving iniquity I got a nature of this world he can step into my spirit realm amen he can step into my spirit realm and try his tactics again right now we know one thing for sure if we've got the Holy Ghost were sealed so the things I do I don't do no more but now what about the preacher what was it Ramsey now see that demon of alcohol he may have had to Falk that before he was a Christian he became a Christian started preaching the met preaching the met his message right brother Brahm tells the story amen then he what does he get what he done was he got us he led a spirit come back and attach itself to him in his spirit realm and he went to drinking again amen that's what the Prophet said the Prophet said he had to take his servant homes with wouldn't Mars name why he couldn't get the soul of brother Ramsey but he attached himself so much to the spirit realm to what there was a desire there our desire must be for God our desire must be like I was talking downstairs we have you know Paul when Paul walked into car rent because remember Paul well I want to tell you this or not Paul was in Corinth when he wrote his letter to the Romans okay he wasn't in Rome he was going to Rome but he was writing to the Saints that were in Rome but he was writing to the Romans but he's in Corinth but remember when he walked into car rent here's our statue for this one statue for that one mother-in-law's living with their son-in-law remember that in the Bible all these other different lists of things that I think I read one day up here that they what that was sitting in Polish congregation now what did he do he didn't go in there and just start knocking idols down he preached the gospel he preached the gospel and the washing of the water of the word that Idol was still on the pole but it didn't have any effect on that person anymore once that person was converted amen but remember Satan don't stop there he'll give you another Idol he'll give you whatever you are to make you Idol is your idol right amen IDL e hey I do Elle's make you ID le so the idols that Paul had to deal with and the idols that we have to deal with the problem with Cara I'm not the problem but the glorious thing about Corinth was to the Corinthians he wrote that book of Correction and remember they turned to God Paul says such were some of you but you are what washed washed by what Paul's word washed by the water of the word through Paul through preaching the washing of the water the word is what not only sanctifies you because once you're sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost that part of sanctification you don't need anymore because it's not in the soul we got to realize something and when I get finished will come to this seventh seal your soul can't be changed it's eternal it's not up or down it's not in or out you're sealed in you got a ticket to glory you oh don't you're not heading toward eternal life you walk you're with eternal life amen now walking with eternal life the vessel that we are has to come under the washing of the water of the word to keep us clean and make us what the Bible say clean every with in other words I die daily a daily sanctification a daily washing the messenger pouring the water in the bucket and driving out all the trash because remember we all still have problems and if you don't have listen if you don't have a problem that you can't tie back to that message the statue of a perfect man what are you sitting here for well you're sitting here for you need to be your aperture don't out of here I don't understand these people that that think the fact you're a perfect man is just it's not we don't need it we meet we don't need it what do you mean we don't need it to me that's one of the most important messages to get us out of here now I didn't say to get us save I said to get us out of here to get us out of here that has to that trash cannot dwell in that vessel and that's not a pyramid that's you and that's what we're trying to do by the washing of the water the word system it doesn't matter if it moves you that much you've moved the things I used to do I do them no more why that part has died that unclean spirit has tried it's best to get back in and you know what use like brother Devils talking about you have something to do with this now there's one thing you can't do you can't justify your past life but you have to ask for forgiveness to trigger to trigger God to get rid of that path all right but now sanctification you got to stand and say I don't want that no more I don't want this no more I don't want you know you something pop up and you go I just don't want that anymore you get sick of it the things used to love you know I didn't mind going to place them sitting in a bar before but you know what means you've got setting the bar the other night we drink all we wanted to wish the drunk when we left we couldn't find the door we drunk on each other but you know what there was no desire for me to order a beer even though I was sitting in Longhorns in the bar I'm not Longhorns I don't go to Longhorns takes the road ham Texas Roadhouse sitting in Texas Roadhouse they put us in a bar but you know what that didn't make me uncomfortable I didn't do like what daddy said I'd say bless God I'm a preacher don't put me in that I play good grief come on now you know why that guy said that he's afraid to go in that bar he might have still had one of them Zach's attached to him he had a sack attack I just came up with that that was funny the others that so from now on when the devil bothers you you have a sack attack [Music] but you know what though we can have fun because you can be so serious you can kill yourself you can be so serious but what I do is is is when I look at something I look at it and say well if I did do that here's the repercussion and I ain't gonna get into my notes again but you know what that's okay don't worry about we'll get it next week couple weeks but I look at the repercussion I'm not I'm not looking at drinking smoking gambling running around when women pornography no I'm not looking at that I'm just looking into general things that I do but you know what I do best thing for you to do we we were talking about something the other day remember when I did that Family Matters series several years ago remember what I told you teenagers to do if something got a little let me put it this way hot and bothered and little got a little close best thing to say brother let's pray boy you talking about but you know what that's using the Word of God as a shield and you know what God's not over I going hey shouldn't have done that no gods over going that's what I put it there for I put it there for you to use it power of prayer amen so in this sanctified life that we're talking about though like you said it's not whether it's not what other I I'm going to heaven or not I'm sealed I'm sealed in you know what God may have to do us like brother Ramsay if we keep misbehaving he'll just shorten our life amen that's just the truth about it but you know what he's doing he's saving your soul he saved your soul amen your soul saved but he won't let you do anything because you are truly a dual person that's just any way on say it you're a dual person you have the Holy Ghost you're a Holy Ghost filled person you're perfect never had a bad fountain day you life but you still living this person that you're looking at me that just had a bad talk all right so that's where we live because we go back to that old Adamic nature that we were born under cuz we can go back to my say up mom and daddy grandma and grandpa remember what brother Brown said he said that after left the epileptic child came from great-great-grandparents how the world there's schools that teaches you about epilepsy and all these things that go on and the prophet of God said it came from a mixed gene too you know two generations ago see that was God telling him to say that to tell you that see how he's watching over all this amen he's watching over us listen he knows gonna make it who's not he absolutely known you before the foundation world but you know what he didn't do it say if I'm not gonna make it to change he's not gonna he's not standing there going ain't gonna make it there's only one person gonna tell you ain't gonna make it now Satan why would God be negative to his own children and why would God be negative now to this generation of people that's going to see the change that's going to see the end that's going to see it so sanctified life that God's going to be pleased to dwell in us all the time Church pleased to dwell in you sure in your soul you're just as eternal as God did because you are God now that's a good person that's why I said most people in this message or two or tunas cuz they make you a second person you're not a second person you are the person of God made manifest in a form called whatever your name is and then if you're born again if you're not then keep working toward it keep working toward it cause in sanctification like I said my psyche attack if it was drinking he's not gonna bring seven drunk Devils back with him he's gonna go over and talk to seven religious demon and say hey I need some help turning this guy cuz I couldn't it's obvious he likes to drink but now you don't want to know more because he's having another different desire so I'm just going to bring seven more devils and bring them in and you're gonna put him on the front row you'll put him on the front row you'll never sit here again with you and play them on the front row and call him a Christian amen that's why I said I'm telling you the sanctified life is good but if you stay there it's the worst condition you can be in cuz Satan will say you're fine you just got to sit there and endure a couple of hours of sermon and then go home and then do what you want it but not in this sanctified life when you take these people right here man they were giving their life for the gospel that's the same thing with me and you cleaned and set aside for service right when we received the new birth we were put in service all right so let's move that out of the way we're already in service for God when we have the new birth in our soul were already where God wanted us to be to begin with now what does he want to do he wants that full fellowship to come back by what by the word washing of water by the word pouring the water in property God there was a box sitting right here it was a box the Prophet are the messenger of the hour he said I just read there was pouring water in the box the trash was running out and running down and she said she said it was running past her feet that was getting rid of the extra stuff like right now come on people if we if all we needed was just to be born again why don't we have to get up and get ready drive an hour drive two hours why did we have to do this if we were born again I mean you're you brought hey listen you Brody turn alive with you this point right you brought it up but why did then why did you what the effort why the effort why because the desire inside of you to know more there's a desire inside of you because that red hole even when that red horse rider was riding and he was doing his killing I want God to ride through my life and kill what's in my life not just bury it I want his head chopped off I want to be able to see it they have bad people they come back to life I'm gonna come back to life but haven't come back out I want to see the thing dead right here because without this we're not gonna take a body change when we still have these doubts of who we are brother Branham says what will know what who we are and what we're doing here so we have Satan's answer the problem is is we don't give him the answer right that's why I like sitting in a church where that that we take the major doctrines when we take these things huh you go talk to people and they're like oh I don't know what my pastor believed what do you mean you don't know what your pastor bleep you better sit him down and ask him your souls involved in this because the prophet of God said you won't go no higher than your pastor goes I didn't say that he did because how could Peter how in the world could Peter the day before Jesus was crucified he said I'll never forsake you like what Dave was telling this morning I'll never forsake you jesus said Peter in other words he probably just sniggered and since in less than 12 hours you'll deny me three times and you think Peter well if they'd be me or you I'd be mad at Jesus what do you mean yeah we'll ask that shows who the are Peter up there right but Peter was chosen to tell us what we needed because he had them and then Paul gave us the whole scene of what happens when we give them you when you receive this you get a schoolmaster that's why I don't understand people think we get sure we got everything we need but why do we need the Bible in Glacius that we need tutors and governors we need teachers we need people to teach us to bring us out why would we need that for that spirit guy we don't need it for Seoul remember your sole signed sealed and delivered you can be blown up in a nuclear explosion and they couldn't find one molecule of your physical body but your sole standing in that six dimension just as solid is that right there and never never will it go back into a sinful body again you hear what I said never go into a sinful body again because the next thing it touches this going into a glorified body a man that all right so the sanctification we're talking about it's not just cleaned and set aside for service waiting on God to come and fill me up he's already filled you up in this part that we're talking about but what he's waiting on he's waiting on cleaned and set aside he has the same jar it's full of the Holy Ghost but he wants to put you in more service he wants more fellowship he wants more of his self to show through you amen and but that red horse rider what was his remember we got contrast remember in the first church age we had the contrast we had a white righteous church on the earth through Peter Paul James and although that was a white righteous church bringing the correct doctrine but there was a white horse attached itself to that that was false and he just kept teaching false and kept teaching false and kept teaching false until finally he got to a place to where what he said well I can't join them I'll just kill him and that's what he did but he couldn't physically kill him all off see Satan smart enough to know he does read the Bible worthy and I don't think he believes it but he says there's a people on the earth that's gonna believe in this God named Jesus guy you know a hey there on the earth here somewhere and I'm gonna try in other words he couldn't just destroy all 7 billion people he said I'll get in their church I'll get in there school I'll get in there textbook I'll get in there Bible and I'll teach them a doctrine that's not even in the Bible the Bible says that the devil's believe in one God and tremble and them same devils teach you a trinity not you but why look 9 times in the world 99% of the world believes that there's three gods or a Trinity doctrine so they must be right it's 99 vs. 1 no give me one remember God and do better with 10% that we can do with 90 all right so let's refuse just review just a second and let's look what God is doing let's go through Daniel 9:24 let's go to that one and then we'll because remember going through this seal we're also going through the six seals or the redemption for us and then the 6 fold purpose is the redemption of Israel right 6 full purpose is the redemption of Israel after we're gone because you don't make an end of sin until after we're gone you don't make reconciliation for iniquity because they're over they don't have the holy go Holy Ghost is only to the Gentile dispensation right now sure there is one or two let me be clear with this there's one or two Israelites that may be bribed but God promised that's telling the guy the other day God promised in the Bible can't take it out that they'd be 144,000 12,000 out of 12 tribes plus 2 prophets and that's it no more that's all God promised though that he would take that trip those tribes and bring them out what give them the Holy Ghost after we leave now look God won't dwell in Israel now as the people because they're unclean God won't go on an unclean vessel right just like he won't dwell in your unclean vessel all right but Daniel 9:24 does away with all that seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things finish the transgression look watch this finish make an end of sin and reconcile iniquity he's cleaning him up just like he cleans you up he's cleaning them up same way through justification sanctification a baptism of the Holy go amen then he what brings in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy we know what those are because we've studied them but that's the sixth full purpose but what's the second one finish the transgression we covered in on the first seal second seal make an end of sins now watch when did that happen when did they do their most horrible sin but remember only a small group of people said this but it affected a whole nation right okay listen now number two write that down Gabriel this is six full purpose number two write this down on your paper we could stay a long time ago the next quote please number three okay now number two write that down on your paper we can stay a long time on that but I don't want to go to preaching I just want to talk to you so you can get it closed when we get into these seven seals now watching puts it to get to together when we get into these seven seals then we'll just move right through the church through the seals through the plagues and know where we're standing all right number two make an end of sins now let's read again Daniel to finish the transgression and make an end of sins that's his second purpose of coming first it's to finish Israel's transgression what chopped off their past sins wanting to go together what we scroll it up please wait a minute up to us this is up scroll up I know it's down but well no no no no go back now it's writing that back there a little bit further down right there when we get these seven seals then we'll just move right through the church to the seals through the plagues and know where we're standing but it but he didn't know what he's talking about and am saying week that's what people say I think he was absolutely perfect in what he was preaching number two make an end of sins now this number two is what we're talking about here the second horse rider because sanctification is bringing us to what Redemption so whatever brings us to Redemption has got to bring them to Redemption our God changed his mind all right to make an end of sins now let's read again Daniel finish the transgression to make them in the sins that's his second purpose of coming first is to finish Israel's transgression and to make an end of sin where did Israel sin where did they do their vile sin where did they separate their self from God now listen close let's turn to st. Matthew 24 here's where Israel made her fatal mistake here's where she'd done her last sin so it must have been a big one and God didn't forgive them until we get out of here all right watch Matthew 27 he means not Matthew 24 and that's the reason she's in the condition today Matthew the 27th chapter of the 25th verse of the 27th chapter let's begin with the 21st verse the governor answered and said unto them whether the Twain will ye that I release unto you and they said Barabbas now remember that's Israel Barabbas Pilate said unto them what shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ listen to them they all said unto Him let him be crucified now remember that's their Messiah that Daniel said would come you remember this morning the lesson he'll be cut off not for himself not nothing he did they didn't be crucified and the government said why what evil has he done but they cried out to more saying let him be crucified hey listen why was he crucified because of them no he's crucified cause of me he was crucified because of me I don't know about them I don't know about you he's crucified because of me because my sins is what he put on the cross that's what I have to believe he put my sins away I can't talk about yours he did mine then Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather a tumult was made and he took water and washed his hands before the monsters he thought he was gonna wash his hands by the water the word being how the word he was fixing to kill the word I am innocent of the blood of this just man listen here's their mistake here's their sin then answered the people said his blood read beyond us and our children on us would have been fine and it would have been over with but when they said and our children that's perpetual generation for 2,000 years God has not dealt with Israel because of that right there but watch that's where they done it he was making an end of sin for them how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing that he had to blind their eyes that we could come in amen it's like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded he knowed they were blinded that's the reason he cried for forgiveness with them Father forgive me Father but they don't know what they're doing they were blind for our sake they were made blind in their unbelief they did this what they didn't believe there's Messiah and you know what you didn't either until you're born again who can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy go amen but when they see him again they men what are they going to see him through two prophets in Israel right they're gonna see that they gonna see this that six full purpose is going to come right through the first three is going to come right through that three and a half your message is about all right confuse you the three-and-a-half-year message of the two prophets as to what save Israel give them the Holy Ghost through the preaching of two prophets that's what we're talking about right here because you got to make an end of that end of forgiveness for end of he's cut not same way staying with you listen when he forgive you your sins he don't ever bring them up in the moment he can't bring Israel's up either the only problem is here's the problem Israel was married to God in the Old Testament first bride she went whoring so he can't take her back as a wife go see if my wife goes and commits adultery and comes back I didn't forgive her but I'm not supposed to I'm not supposed to marry her she's defiled right I'm supposed to divorce her and put her away and I'm marrying in that's what that's what God did but that but that she can't be restored back to my wife not supposed to be anyway okay according to the Bible so that's what Jesus Jesus couldn't bring Israel back in now she he brings them back in under the 144,000 and under the two witnesses and under the servants but not his bride this is not bride but this is the called out of Israel that's going to get their sins forgiven their iniquity done away with and all those great things put an end to sin what is sin unbelief they did not believe that that was a messiah they could not see him as the Messiah yet he don't ever sign the Messiah was supposed to do but they could not see it they were blind he made an end of their sinned sin is what unbelief not smoking drinking cussing and all those things but they didn't believe he was a messiah so they put him to death what they killed him and they counted his blood not worthy listen folks those people even conflicts of the great religious leaders of the day sure they're standing there watching the crucifixion they just see Amanda they just see Amanda I stopped them aside to them that's just a man they were ready to get rid of ya he run his mouth too much he was against me and my religion and the religion of the day they didn't know that was gone even though he said Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing whoever that was in that crowd shouted that day I said let his blood be on us and our children that's what brother Brown said that's where they made their fatal mistake that red horse rider rode right through that crowd red is blood but now remember red is blood but remember we we read and we may have time to read one more that what happened red also as the red heifer which means Redemption because remember be redeemed this to be brought back right how can you be brought back if you've got all these little trashy things you can't have little trashy things and be brought all the way back you'll be brought back to a certain place hey listen you know what you can do you close your thing you can go to right here you can go right here you choose how far up you go you choose how much water you want you choose how much words you want that's why Satan said I'm gonna get on a red horse and I'm gonna ride through the longest age and I'm gonna say I'm the most powerful Christian organization there ever was amen but I'm gonna kill all them other people them 68 million I'm gonna kill them and I'm not gonna kill them just because they're Jews Gentiles Greeks I'm gonna kill them cuz they don't agree with me they don't agree with my doctrine so I'm gonna kill him so that's exactly what happened when Satan got off of that white horse he got on that red horse and he said hey if I can't join them I'm gonna kill him hey man I'm gonna kill him I'm going to physically kill him and then while I'm physically killing them I'm still gonna attach myself to that church and I'm gonna spiritually kill him and I'm gonna kill them all through that 15 hundred years and you know what when they come out even under luther and wesley even when they come out i'm still gonna be riding i'm still gonna be killing them with my doctrine amen cuz he was giving a what he was given a sword a short is a word i all he's got to do is look all satan's got to do the difference in god's word satan's word is one word the difference in Satan's word and God's Word is one word off that's how close it is amen that's how close we're coming with these seals I mean wow let's care for one more and then one stop that all right we've been going just an hour but in numbers we talk about the red heifer now really glad that that that brother brought that out let's go to number Punk number four we know about the red heifer so let's skip a little bit but I want you to watch how God did something and that brother did a real good job with Rahab amen did a real good job preaching on Rahab no ma'am hey listen let me let me just be plain she needed a real work of sanctification physically she was totally unclean think of the men she had in that City she was totally unclean according to man's ideas according to her carne our flesh hey man that's what your brother was bringing now according to her flesh no hope no hope same way with me and you know hope I was just pure as I could be your mind was black your soul was black yeah Amen I watch oh if you know this red heifer notice being female coming to church so where's redemption going to come to not the church nominal but the bride redemption will only come through the bride of Jesus Christ and then read the color couldn't be spotted now had to be a solid color see that's what the problem with today now in the denominational world you can't come to full sanctification like God wants you to because you're spotted Trinitarian doctrine father son holy go eternal hell all these different things there's spots brother the Bible remember talks about spots in your feast but this has to be a solid color red red always gives us signifies redemption you say red always signifies danger it does to us in a red light but it's always redemption to don't run it so red has always been the sign through the Bible so look at Satan is going starting his ride he thinks he's going to kill these people you know what God's saying I'm sanctify people I'm gonna make them so sanctified because they're gonna be clean and I'm gonna put them in service like never before I'm talking about us because the seals are us the second seal didn't open in this church aid but it is a parallel or a type ii still didn't openings in the four churches right physically open like that no no it's in symbol form it's a symbol but now we look back and we see it but it's always redemption to don't run it so red has always been assigned through the bible the harlot Rahab let the spies down to a scarlet cloth or scarlet cord which was a sign that God left her house standing the story of Rahab the story of Rahab is an impossible story to follow if you don't understand in sanctification Amen sanctification is clean and set aside for service right cleaned and set aside for service how can God clean me I've never asked God how can he clean me up I know how he can clean me up word listen to the word I know how he can do that but listen before let's close on that before we go I told the brother in the study there I said have you ever thought of this and when Rahab let those guys down and there was that red rope hanging think about this that city was so big until they said you could run chariot races around the top of the wall so think about how wide that wall would have to be at least from that door to that door for even maybe three chariots to run a race around it and the city the the city residents were built against the wall amen all right so after all this is left that the children of Israel look out and they see one little red cord hanging off of a piece of wall way out in the horizon think about it I saw what was left of that wall was Rahab's house and a red cord hanging down and I can think of that Israeli general listing that Israeli general salmone he sees Rahab different than any man he'd ever seen any woman he'd ever seen and she probably looked at him different from any man she had ever seen because oh she had been with a lot of men like that brother talking about but one day Rahab walks up to Salman and says Salman do you really want me do you really want me I'm not clean I'm not in condition to be your wife because I'm an unclean person can't do it you know what Salman said someone says all I see on the horizon it looks like a cross it looks like a cross in the horizon was something red hanging down from it that's all I see and he said by the way where are your accuser right she said they're all dead there are no witness he said I didn't see you do it remember Jesus the woman caught in the act of adultery they threw her down and said we caught her in the very act what do you say you know the story he gets rid of him he says Rahab where are your accusers right she looks around and she says I don't have any he said I didn't see you do it I didn't see you do it go and sin no more Salman said Rahab I didn't see you do those things bring me one man cuz everybody Jericho died everybody Jericho was dead her hold her sins were gone her old past was gone talk about sanctification oh my lord man she's standing that night yet nothing listen hold on a minute she definitely wasn't a virgin okay but she was forgiven for what she had done right amen is that okay but you and I were Rahab ourselves we prosecuted ourselves to the world whatever you want to name it you put your whole list down it doesn't matter if your list is this higher this high it says sin at the top amen but when you get finished and all your accusers are dead you do like Salman you walk out of that tent you go all I see is red I don't see your passion no more all I see is a red string hanging out of a building that saved a group of people so that God could save you hey man you know the Lord when we see a real act of sanctification that's it and God did the same thing to you he had to because how is he going to attach yourself to an unclean vessel he can't that's why you got to go through justification you can't be sanctified with your past sins still hanging on your understand is one day that's singing so you'll see what God's really done I have learned to trust in Jesus [Music] all that you've done through all that [Music] there was a place she came to that God thought so much of that oneness through he brought a ladies to bring David out of [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus in he believe it it's true [Applause] all [Music] to depend upon his [Music] and this through it all more time to have a name all through I have learned to trust in Jesus to trust him little Oh I have learned to depend upon his and it's true [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God he ever got up swore to give her peace you just remember he learned to depend upon his race for time [Music] they said I have to trust in Jesus it's gone it's out of here God don't even remember it all through [Music] and [Music] learn to trust in Jesus [Music] the frame board that you were blessed on mr. Lord and give her good grades on the task Lord may the things come back to her memory Lord and she'll give you the praise and honor and glory for it made this nervousness go away and anything to hit her in Jesus name we pray amen don't worry about okay you need the price for these children they're getting ready to go through these tabs for Mom darling all that just remember you'd pray for them just like you pray for a signature you pray for them to get good grades on their tests they got nervousness away to depend upon his work hey man let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray Lord today that what we've said has been pleasing to you and we truly look all we have Lord is to look the Calvary there's that red string running all the way down through the Bible of redemption redemption redemption that red blood at Calvary cleaned and set aside even this whole world and our bodies were laying here Lord I pray this should be with us now take care of each one be with the children as they take these tests Lord may they do well and give you honor and praise and glory for him through the ones that are sick not here Lord be with the ones that are traveling just take care of them and bless them be with them in the name of Jesus Christ the whole week we're gonna give you honor and glory and come back Lord and give you more and more praise Lord lift our hands and say thank you Jesus be with us as we make our little trip and come back safe to you father just be with this group of people Lord that you've given giving us an opportunity to speak to the Lord may you sanctifies for our journey Lord many times in the Bible when Israel got ready to move God would come down through Moses and say sanctify yourself physically they would wash clothes and do the physical thing the Lord is not the washing of the pots or clothes or or their physical body but Lord is the washing of the water by the word maybe we depend more on your word than ever Lord because that's what's going to take us through the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things and the congregation says a man you're dismissed god bless you [Music] buddy [Music]
