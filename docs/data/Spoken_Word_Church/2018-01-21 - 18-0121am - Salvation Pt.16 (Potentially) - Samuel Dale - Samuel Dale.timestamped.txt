[7:52] sinuses or bronchitis or whatever you
[7:56] know it's just keeps heard of going all
[7:58] the time on that and you know you can

[8:02] it just doesn't do much good anymore for
[8:05] what you do and you're done war out and
[8:07] that's you no matter how old you are
[8:10] you're subject to all of these things
[8:12] but just remember to pray for all of the
[8:15] sickness just pray at everybody I that's
[8:17] what I do I just pray Lord you be with
[8:20] everybody because it's a that's a way of
[8:23] doing it we had a good time over to
[8:25] fellowship meeting yesterday in in
[8:27] Alabama brother Douglas brother Richard
[8:31] Douglas priest he done a good job
[8:33] ministering unto us some had a good time
[8:36] in fellowship and all like that the Lord
[8:39] willing brother Lewis will be
[8:41] ministering this coming Wednesday we're
[8:44] sorry that we missed this last Wednesday
[8:46] but I hope y'all done what we done we
[8:49] were just we just gathered together as a
[8:52] whole family and ate supper together and
[8:54] and we put on the message of the
[8:57] Intervale or while God's people are so
[9:01] talked about is the title of it I had
[9:04] requested that you listened to that
[9:06] message and so we just as a family we
[9:08] just sit down in the living room at
[9:10] Terrance's and and listen to that you
[9:12] know and had our service and things of
[9:15] that way and I hope you hope you've had
[9:16] an opportunity to listen to that message
[9:18] because
[9:21] there's a lot of things said in that
[9:23] message that will be very very needful
[9:25] as we continue on through this part
[9:30] series that we're on talking about
[9:32] salvation it would be very needful to to
[9:36] you to listen to it because if you
[9:39] listen intently Levine you know what
[9:41] brother Brown does you know he'll bring
[9:45] the man from this to say this about that
[9:47] message where you listen to it he brings
[9:49] a man to justification sanctification
[9:52] baptism on the whole to go outer Court
[9:54] inner court Holy of Holies all right he
[9:59] explains that but you got to listen real
[10:02] carefully after a while he has that same
[10:05] man that he's put behind the veil back
[10:10] out into the outer court and carries him
[10:15] back through again and see if you don't
[10:19] listen like that you're gonna miss the
[10:20] whole thoughts of of adoptions or or any
[10:25] things about the new birth you're going
[10:28] to miss it if you don't listen to what
[10:30] he's saying then that way it's not me
[10:33] saying it you just listen and you
[10:36] haven't because see in the natural type
[10:41] nobody but our Jew could go into that
[10:45] outer Court let alone the inner court or
[10:50] behind the veil
[10:52] only as you could go remember they got
[10:54] on the fall about it ringing Peter in
[10:56] you know see because that was a strict
[11:00] rule that's what I'm saying then you
[11:02] you've got to get that part and get him
[11:04] over here then you come back start up
[11:06] statue of perfect man with the same guy
[11:09] so if you'll just listen that away I
[11:10] tell you that ahead of time and if you
[11:13] listen with that thought you will see
[11:16] why the Prophet will make statements
[11:18] that seemingly are contradictory to the
[11:23] other statements that he will make even
[11:25] in the same paragraph you know or
[11:29] sometimes in the same sentence
[11:31] they put you listen it's not
[11:33] contradictory he's explaining something
[11:36] you know get that to you to do okay and
[11:39] to another thing I might make sure we
[11:42] listen always to the hi services and the
[11:45] other day I said that the two sons of
[11:47] Naomi were Gentiles I meant to say their
[11:50] wives were Gentiles not the two sons
[11:53] they were Naomi's and her husband they
[11:57] were Jews we call it you know Israelites
[12:00] whatever you'd call it
[12:01] it was Ruth and what would her name Obed
[12:06] know Ruth is now missed the two
[12:09] daughter-in-laws route was ruth and obed
[12:11] i guess was anyhow anyhow the two that
[12:15] were there so just you know I correct
[12:17] that were somebody listening they said
[12:19] boy he don't know what he's talkin about
[12:21] cuz the two sons of Naomi words were
[12:24] part of the Jewish race and in doing but
[12:27] anyhow we're not all perfect but I'll
[12:32] ask you a question
[12:33] do you know what the what is the word
[12:37] for that in other words the way they
[12:40] tell whether a document a book or
[12:45] anything is authentic do you know the
[12:48] one test it goes through first of being
[12:52] authentic and they go by it stronger
[12:57] than they do anything else in other
[12:59] words you write a book you somebody
[13:01] write a book and they say well so and so
[13:03] wrote this book and you say no they
[13:07] didn't because the test you put on the
[13:13] book to see whether it's real or not is
[13:15] to see how many contradictions how many
[13:21] things that are said that are not worded
[13:23] exactly that's the test now you you
[13:27] don't do it with a book find out because
[13:29] when you take a book and it comes out
[13:31] perfect with no contradictions that
[13:33] means somebody has tampered with it and
[13:36] corrected all of the things that were
[13:40] said wrong check it out to me you'll
[13:43] find out that we make our most
[13:45] I listen to these brothers and you know
[13:47] they all life it mean everybody does
[13:49] about something like that making a
[13:50] mistake well with Daddy 77 and I hear
[13:53] Wayde and Bob and Louise and an errand
[13:57] and and they take a word and it goes 90
[13:59] miles thataway you know I said you know
[14:03] they doing same thing I do there because
[14:06] your brain gets ahead of your mouth and
[14:10] when your brain gets ahead of your mouth
[14:12] you're gonna say things that's not right
[14:16] but you know what that way you'll find
[14:18] that worse original or not that's my
[14:20] point okay
[14:21] so just think about that okay Jonah -
[14:23] and Luke father we thank you for your
[14:27] grace and your love father unto us we
[14:29] thank you for everything and we just ask
[14:31] you to bless us now as we read your word
[14:33] and Lord that we may comment upon your
[14:36] word and try to get the people to see
[14:38] what is upon our hearts and our thoughts
[14:41] we love you and we thank you just reach
[14:44] down and and touch the people you
[14:46] promised it we can depend upon that code
[14:49] you said you sent your word and healed
[14:51] us so if we've nothing else we pick up
[14:53] the Bible and read by your stripes we
[14:55] are healed that is your word and you
[14:59] will honor that word when we believe it
[15:01] and accept it so have your way with all
[15:04] of these sicknesses and things and just
[15:06] let your light shine in our hearts and
[15:09] lives we love you and we thank you in
[15:11] Jesus name
[15:14] okay Jonah oh yeah right we got an
[15:20] announcement boy's brother boys class
[15:22] since sister Monica's class will
[15:25] practice at 12:45 okay get it for the
[15:29] boys class versus sister Monica's class
[15:31] practice 12:45 okay
[15:38] but I will sanctify I'm excused I will
[15:41] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[15:43] Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have
[15:46] vowed salvation is of the Lord and the
[15:49] Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited
[15:51] out Jonah upon the dry land remember our
[15:53] point salvation deliver it Jonah come
[15:56] out alright let's go now and we'll try
[15:59] to get this thought if we get far enough
[16:02] I don't will carry it later but from
[16:05] Luke 24 word will begin at 44 you read
[16:09] up above and and everything and get to
[16:13] text and authority and this is after his
[16:16] resurrection and he's eating the fish
[16:19] with them and the things you know and
[16:20] then he tells him and he said them to
[16:23] them these are the words which I spake
[16:25] unto you while I was yet with you that
[16:28] all things must be fulfilled which were
[16:30] written in the law of Moses and in the
[16:33] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[16:36] now what was all of the Old Testament
[16:39] here's the thought of the morning what
[16:40] was all of the Old Testament taught and
[16:44] shadows of what was to come we've
[16:48] emphasized it over and over and over the
[16:52] natural story was to Abraham and his
[16:55] lineage he didn't mention salvation it
[17:01] was natural lineage land and people
[17:05] right then that is an example of the
[17:11] salvation that they receive by believing
[17:14] on the Lord and it supplies them a place
[17:17] to go to all right everybody with me
[17:19] they then everything in the Old
[17:21] Testament stops and shatters that's what
[17:23] he's saying to them you know now you
[17:25] remember this is to fulfill those time
[17:28] what's then open neither understanding
[17:31] that they might understand the scripture
[17:33] this is before now Jesus Christ came
[17:37] back you know I stood before the coming
[17:38] of the Holy Ghost this is a prior to
[17:43] that right at that point then open he
[17:46] their understanding that they might
[17:48] understand the scripture rise the new
[17:49] birth
[17:51] he opened her understanding there was no
[17:56] new birth there because there was no
[17:59] Jesus Christ returned to give it all
[18:02] right
[18:02] this is his point of where he was tired
[18:05] and said unto them thus it is written
[18:08] and thus it birth of Christ to suffer
[18:11] and to rise from the dead the third day
[18:14] and that repentance and remission of
[18:18] sins should be preached in his name
[18:20] among all nations beginning at Jerusalem
[18:24] and you are witnesses of these things
[18:31] okay you may be seated the Lord had his
[18:34] blessing to the reading of the word all
[18:37] right now still speaking of salvation
[18:42] and we're still I've tried to get over
[18:45] to the New Testament talks that I want
[18:47] to bring but I keep coming in two spots
[18:51] and said I've got to say something here
[18:53] I've got to say something here you know
[18:56] to make sure you don't misunderstand
[19:00] where we're at all right so now we're
[19:03] still talking about the Old Testament
[19:06] now remember listen you say to people of
[19:10] the world and the people this message
[19:13] you say turn to the first book of the
[19:16] New Testament and then you start reading
[19:19] in acts 1 and a lot of the congregation
[19:25] is in Matthew 1 right now we're to note
[19:31] that in the Baptist Church what we did I
[19:32] mean we talked about those things you
[19:34] know that the New Testament but didn't
[19:36] begin until the day after the death of
[19:38] the testator that's Scripture so the New
[19:41] Testament never begun in Matthew Matthew
[19:44] was still Jesus at that time was
[19:46] fulfilling the scriptures or Galatians I
[19:49] get it written down here to me where he
[19:51] came under the law to redeem them that
[19:54] were under the law so he had to come
[19:57] under the law
[20:01] Matthew Mark Luke and John was still
[20:03] before or right you know a little bit
[20:05] right at the end of Matt the gospel they
[20:08] talk about the resurrection but they
[20:11] don't talk about the coming of the Holy
[20:12] Ghost that struck under their Pentecost
[20:15] all right now so then you remember that
[20:18] we're all being then types and shadows
[20:21] but remember our point I keep
[20:23] emphasizing this if the tops and the
[20:26] shadows the top in the shadow you can a
[20:29] little bit of difference in sometimes
[20:31] when you're saying it because you take a
[20:33] canoe is the top of a big ocean liner
[20:36] well there's a vast difference between
[20:38] the truth but they have the same
[20:41] principle that will float they will
[20:45] carry people etc etc all right now watch
[20:49] that after a while when we get down to
[20:51] speaking on something that is going to
[20:55] be very valuable to us if we'll listen
[20:58] all right
[20:59] and we've get into partial realization
[21:01] compared to perfect realization remember
[21:05] the whole thought that we've been on
[21:06] this whole series whatever you start
[21:10] with you must carry it into the New
[21:13] Testament Old Testament it was the blood
[21:15] of bulls and goats right but in the New
[21:20] Testament of blood of Jesus Christ right
[21:22] see now still the blood it's still the
[21:25] doing this is a type of this over here
[21:29] everything we are in our life as a type
[21:32] of that's reading I love Malachi 4 you
[21:36] notice Malachi 3 4 and right 2 though it
[21:38] says what remember ye he's in in the Old
[21:43] Testament you know in that form Malachi
[21:46] and what was it saying remember you the
[21:49] law of Moses then he starts talking
[21:55] about the coming of Elijah
[21:58] what's the lives are going to do restore
[22:01] all the word remember you the law of
[22:04] Moses remember the word remember the Ten
[22:07] Commandments wouldn't a book of rules is
[22:10] a revelation of God to the people which
[22:13] they took it for the wrong
[22:14] all right now follow me then okay then
[22:19] we we say that all back Dyer will see it
[22:22] typed them because the Old Testament
[22:25] Laura it dealt with the land and the
[22:30] people and who it belonged to and what
[22:32] they're done in this and following it
[22:33] down through this group of people etc
[22:35] but you had no new birth
[22:40] you had no form in that we'll get to it
[22:44] in a minute where the Prophet said that
[22:45] there wasn't even in Redemption now we
[22:50] know he's not saying that there wasn't
[22:52] something back there of salvation he's
[22:54] got his point he's making a point of
[22:57] illustration so listen to that point C
[23:00] alright but what is salvation based upon
[23:04] starting back dire and holding it and
[23:07] it'll bring it on over to here believing
[23:11] right
[23:12] the very first key is to believing I
[23:16] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[23:18] thou shalt be saved
[23:19] believe in their salvation dur their
[23:24] land getting their their inheritances or
[23:28] their everything under the tops and
[23:30] shadows would ever get into believing
[23:34] you know what not believing all of God
[23:40] you know but believing in that God cuz
[23:45] Hebrews says he that comes to God must
[23:46] believe that he is alright now abraham
[23:50] believed God is he didn't believe God
[23:53] was because he believed he was he went
[23:56] back to his idols because that's where
[23:58] he come from
[23:59] alright but he believes in something
[24:02] real salvation is in something that's
[24:07] real to you and I it's not just an
[24:11] imagination or a thought or or shaking a
[24:14] hand or I done this or I done that you
[24:16] know it's on the basis of whether or not
[24:20] you can believe God is speaking to you
[24:26] I mean he caught one man in the days of
[24:32] Abraham in a world of billions of people
[24:40] one man you know what that one man had
[24:43] to believe it they can we can we believe
[24:50] it all right but those people back guard
[24:54] had to believe now what's their life's
[24:59] message they had to believe that God was
[25:04] speaking to them and that his speaking
[25:08] to them was calling them unto Him for
[25:14] whatever the purpose was the land the
[25:18] doings are there everything else but it
[25:20] what they had to believe and remember
[25:22] the last message was about your calling
[25:24] an election to make it sure then many
[25:28] are called but few are chosen that we
[25:31] can say well I've got a call on my life
[25:33] brother branham said that was the worst
[25:36] problem Satan could do because he'll
[25:39] tell you when you got it that you don't
[25:43] got it and he'll tell you when you don't
[25:44] got it did you have God right that's the
[25:48] way Satan will attacked us he never
[25:52] tells you you got something when you got
[25:54] something right he'll tell you you don't
[25:58] have it got the code that's his whole
[26:01] point
[26:02] all right now see they had to believe
[26:05] that God was speaking to them and
[26:07] calling them to step forth and do a
[26:11] certain thing oh you know it you could
[26:14] pick out any of them David see he had to
[26:16] believe it and his believing made a
[26:19] confidence within him that he had no
[26:21] fear of the line the buyer or Goliath or
[26:24] anything you know why because he was
[26:27] believing he believed that God would be
[26:31] there
[26:33] huh and it would be real to him all
[26:36] right now so remember you're calling me
[26:41] he called the disciples they're in
[26:45] morale so he called Judas and told him
[26:49] come follow but Judas notice colors is
[26:54] we'll get to a little more in the
[26:55] message we're going on all right
[26:58] then believing now try to pull that
[27:01] message in that God is calling you for a
[27:05] specific thing not to just well I
[27:09] believe the message well I go to church
[27:12] and I've been you know I've got a gold
[27:14] star for missing church well that's all
[27:18] well and wonderful but that don't save
[27:21] you me we want to make those forms of
[27:26] something to make a salvation I was
[27:29] talking to a man night work one time and
[27:32] I noticed this this guy's walked over
[27:34] where we were at and we were talking
[27:36] about something I forgot what it was but
[27:38] anyhow we were talking and all at once
[27:42] he quoted the scripture that was 40
[27:45] miles away from what we were talking
[27:48] about it was so far away till it you
[27:51] know until I really turned her head
[27:54] looked at him I said what is that got to
[27:57] do what we're talking about you know
[28:02] what he said he said I just wanted you
[28:05] to know that I go to church Ted
[28:09] everybody saying I just wanted you to
[28:12] know that I go to church well I was
[28:14] shocked in all right but now listen
[28:19] they had a salvation back in that Old
[28:23] Testament remember they had a repentance
[28:30] not necessarily to get down and pray
[28:32] that in the repent as we think maybe and
[28:34] call out Jesus or whatever was but they
[28:37] believed in God and they tried to repent
[28:40] of what they were doing and they even
[28:42] had the fact that they had to follow to
[28:44] that by the law and the keepings and
[28:47] their doings in their life and they
[28:49] couldn't do this and etc but they had a
[28:52] repentance back there throughout the Old
[28:57] Testament had a repentance and they had
[29:01] a fact of believing God called them
[29:04] alright
[29:05] they had a cleansing in their life we'll
[29:09] get to these later cuz it's time to to
[29:11] together alright and they were justified
[29:18] by believing on God huh
[29:23] they were sanctified by cleansing and
[29:26] setting them aside from the world and
[29:29] especially after the giving of the law
[29:32] and I said that correctly after the law
[29:36] coming into being you had a record in
[29:38] different things so you did have a lot
[29:40] more maybe cleansing of people and
[29:44] trying to keep their self cleaned after
[29:46] the law came into existence and that was
[29:48] what it was added for because the
[29:50] scripture said it was given because of
[29:51] the transgression of mankind
[29:54] alright now so first step in salvation
[29:59] is believing that God is real believing
[30:09] that he's speaking to you not to
[30:12] everybody
[30:13] do you personal all right they believe
[30:18] he's real believing that he is speaking
[30:23] and talking to you and that has some
[30:27] reason for calling you know he has some
[30:34] some happening dire all right
[30:37] now see not just to believe on a God or
[30:42] that there is a
[30:43] odd somewhere you know or whatever but
[30:46] to have a reality and thoughts in your
[30:50] mind of a God that lives right now we're
[30:54] still the Old Testament right we haven't
[30:57] come to salvation in the New Testament
[30:58] we're still under the salvation of the
[31:00] Old Testament part of talking about it
[31:03] all right now then to know that God in
[31:09] that part back there he was speaking of
[31:14] what would later come into being
[31:18] not the whole Old Testament is speaking
[31:23] of what would come into being at a later
[31:26] date all right so now let's pick up if
[31:32] we can the thoughts of moving from now
[31:38] be careful with the wording listen we're
[31:41] going to be talking in this message
[31:43] about the disciples right and God coming
[31:50] to them gonna ask you a question before
[31:54] we start do you believe this happened or
[31:58] maybe they were do have to read the
[32:00] Bible do you know the disciples were
[32:03] three and a half years following the
[32:04] Lord Jesus right and not one of them had
[32:09] a born-again experience code it couldn't
[32:12] be done until Jesus came in first if I
[32:14] now come on that's valuable but I think
[32:18] they had a salvation well let me ask you
[32:20] a question if you think they had a
[32:23] salvation like you think they had a
[32:25] salvation like we were told in the
[32:27] denominations that they had come on they
[32:32] thought they had that salvation back
[32:33] there if it was that form of salvation
[32:36] well if Judas went to justification and
[32:38] sanctification why wasn't he saved
[32:43] I've always told you you can think what
[32:46] you won't do about this old boy Judas
[32:48] Iscariot was a fine fellow must have
[32:50] been now I know what the Bible says that
[32:52] he was who he was a thief from the
[32:55] beginning and Jesus knew about right but
[32:57] you know nobody else didn't know about
[32:58] it but you know we say Judas was this
[33:02] that didn't look what he does will you
[33:03] tell me what the Year done I mean you
[33:08] have no record of Jesus getting I mean
[33:10] of Judas getting vehemently upset and
[33:12] starting to cursing and things and
[33:15] claiming not even to know Jesus but
[33:17] Peter did but you know I love the
[33:21] scripture cause Jesus had already said
[33:25] said Peter it's the devil has taught you
[33:31] in other word and said he's gonna pull
[33:34] you and drag you down but said what he
[33:37] said I've prayed for you so now you
[33:43] decide what you want to between Jesus
[33:45] and Judas I mean I'm not one of these
[33:47] Judas days and people in the days and
[33:49] trying to make Judas a fine guy no he
[33:51] was just like all the rest of them but
[33:54] all the rest of them are just like him
[33:57] Yeah right
[33:59] alright now let's talk about the
[34:06] disciples
[34:09] moving up from just saying oh now listen
[34:14] to my point
[34:15] you had the salvation of the people or
[34:18] deliverance isn't a and under under
[34:21] those people of Abraham and things it
[34:24] was all natural things of land and this
[34:28] that or the other
[34:29] now that would speak off the salvation
[34:34] that would come to bring it more into
[34:37] mankind right that would speak of the
[34:40] New Testament coming forth but we've got
[34:42] to have a wedge in between and that's
[34:46] where your disciples fall into a
[34:48] situation that they're not talking about
[34:51] Co Jesus never told them come follow me
[34:53] and I'll give you land in houses now
[34:58] remember what he said in other words he
[35:01] said come follow me and leave every bit
[35:04] of that am i right
[35:07] did he not tell him come follow me and
[35:10] lay down all these things believe you
[35:12] mama
[35:12] leave you daddy it's moving up into a
[35:17] rim of bringing salvation more into
[35:21] reality that it would start dealing with
[35:26] man and his doings instead of land and
[35:31] opportunity to do this or whatever
[35:33] it would move up from Abraham being
[35:35] promised all of this land it would move
[35:38] up to Peter him giving up all land but
[35:42] it would move into a salvation for them
[35:45] that would be greater than Abraham could
[35:47] ever think of
[35:49] are you with me so then when you would
[35:53] start with the disciples
[35:55] so I emphasize that those disciples were
[35:59] not under the New Testament the New
[36:05] Testament never begun until the book of
[36:07] Acts now come on those disciples were
[36:10] still under the law Jesus was under the
[36:13] law he had to pay the price of the law
[36:16] he had to go and do everything according
[36:19] to the law he was circumcised on the
[36:21] eighth day he
[36:23] with all of the things that the law
[36:25] required and even when he here one to
[36:29] remember what he said he said go off for
[36:32] the offering of Moses right there was no
[36:39] new born again it was no born to get
[36:41] experience in Matthew Mark Luke and John
[36:46] it was only types and shadows of it but
[36:50] remember what was taking place was a
[36:51] wonderful types and shadows as the tops
[36:54] in the shadows of the land and the
[36:56] things to Abraham and them showed that
[36:59] it would come to a place that the
[37:01] disciples would walk with Almighty God
[37:04] and have a personal contact with him
[37:09] greater than to listen greater than
[37:13] Abraham had even though he saw God met
[37:18] him and thing but here comes God down
[37:20] now to the disciples in human flesh and
[37:25] walks upon the shores of Galilee with
[37:28] the disciples a lot greater isn't it are
[37:33] you listening I've tried to explain it
[37:35] over and over to you you got to take
[37:37] this and start with it and let it grow
[37:41] it's always a constant upward growing
[37:45] it's like the new birth here at faith
[37:47] but then you've got to grow into the
[37:49] stature of a perfect man and that's
[37:54] worth it I wanted you to listen go to
[37:58] remember the message enter Intervale is
[38:01] really I say interval in but it's
[38:04] interval but it's you know while God's
[38:08] people still tossed about 56
[38:11] he was already preaching the stature of
[38:14] a perfect man but he wasn't calling it
[38:17] that because he didn't know to call it
[38:19] that you said well how do you know code
[38:22] I can go to statue of a perfect man in
[38:23] quoting he said I just got these
[38:26] scriptures the other day you know add to
[38:30] your faith virtue or knowledge I just
[38:32] got these scriptures the other day on
[38:35] something that I
[38:36] going to speak on the he knew in 56 that
[38:42] there was more to it than just a new
[38:44] birth he knew better than the old
[38:50] Baptist we get everything when we
[38:51] believe he knew better than the
[38:56] Pentecostals that got everything shouted
[38:58] out when they bleed he already knew you
[39:04] know about the things of the Word of God
[39:06] and a growth development of that person
[39:11] in 56 so what do you think he was doing
[39:15] 456 262 then it comes in approaches in
[39:21] stature of a perfect now listen Church
[39:27] the disciples the Lord came himself
[39:32] personally and live with them you know
[39:35] ate with him fed them you know they got
[39:39] to eat of the benefits of the fish that
[39:42] was created this and out of the other oh
[39:45] no you know he didn't just tell him say
[39:48] come on boys and follow me and y'all dig
[39:49] up as much as you can along the way he
[39:51] fed him he took care of them for three
[39:54] and a half years who paid the bills for
[39:58] those food that they was going after
[39:59] didn't it say one time somebody sent him
[40:02] into the to buy food
[40:05] Judas remember the guy was the money he
[40:07] was the one to go in to buy the food all
[40:10] right and see he fed them he done all
[40:13] the things well don't you realize that
[40:15] maybe you know we look at Nicodemus and
[40:18] we say Nicodemus is this and the kid
[40:20] don't you know those disciples knew all
[40:22] about Nicodemus
[40:28] come on math you must have known it or
[40:33] which one rocks it he must have known it
[40:38] or you know John is the one where he
[40:41] says you must be born again he must have
[40:45] known about Nicodemus you understand
[40:48] what I'm saying they live with him for
[40:50] three and a half years they witnessed
[40:52] the signs and the wonders they witnessed
[40:55] the dead raised the sick healed and
[40:57] heard the gospel right for three and a
[41:05] half years so here's the question oh
[41:09] don't ask a moment ago you never thought
[41:13] about that it took them three and a half
[41:15] years to come to salvation
[41:21] it took one 30 minute sermon on the day
[41:25] of Pentecost and a group of people come
[41:31] to the born-again experience why why
[41:41] what Italy disciples come to salvation
[41:51] when immediately after the coming of the
[41:54] Holy Ghost
[41:54] it took 130 minute I'm just saying 30
[41:57] minutes you don't come about you can
[41:58] read whatever might have been a 5 minute
[41:59] sermon and they received the baptism of
[42:03] the Holy Ghost
[42:06] they go over to the warehouse of canoes
[42:08] is that the one where they they just
[42:10] went over and they heard the message and
[42:12] they said can we forbid these to be
[42:18] baptized that has received the Holy
[42:20] Ghost that we did at the beginning you
[42:26] don't never think like 3 and 1/2 years
[42:30] compared with a 30 second 30 minute
[42:32] sermon and the same Holy Ghost comes I
[42:36] know it I've explained it over and over
[42:39] we'll get back to it when that 120 the
[42:41] Upper Room they received the Holy Ghost
[42:43] at a higher place than the ones that
[42:45] received it on the day of Pentecost they
[42:47] just heard one sermon we don't have time
[42:50] to try to preach all of that over again
[42:51] if you want to know anything about that
[42:54] ask me later all right but now listen
[42:58] surely they heard of Nicodemus and all
[43:01] of the things that Jesus Christ had done
[43:04] and they came to are in the scriptures
[43:07] until that say now we believe
[43:13] now we believe that no man has to do
[43:18] this that or the other to you people you
[43:20] know just different ones we believe that
[43:24] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[43:27] Living God
[43:31] they were great believers they've seen
[43:35] all the signs and the wonders of the
[43:39] dead raise the sick Hill food multiply
[43:41] all kind of things they were believers
[43:47] but they didn't believe didn't believe
[43:49] enough evidently not as I'm believed
[43:52] enough to bring the Holy Ghost on them
[43:56] right well all it is brother this is we
[44:01] believe it and I got the Holy Ghost when
[44:03] I believe now show me that any word in
[44:05] the Bible you know we'll get back to it
[44:10] eventually that there is places young
[44:13] okay but we're trying to make a point
[44:16] trying to make a point to you and I to
[44:18] think about something I would to God I
[44:24] have always preached this away and I
[44:27] always been that way so don't worry
[44:29] about it's always from the beginning
[44:30] I've always said I wish I could preach
[44:33] until everybody in this building would
[44:36] think about whether or not they're saved
[44:39] and would consider your own self to see
[44:44] whether you are not I've come through
[44:48] all of them great expression well you
[44:50] can't tell me I ain't born again I've
[44:53] been following this message 40 years so
[44:57] had Judas and he was a believer
[45:02] why did not his believing carry him home
[45:08] okay
[45:11] I've always said it not a lot to worry
[45:14] about it not flying if Judas Iscariot
[45:17] hadn't went out and hung yourself walked
[45:18] over to the shop would and went with him
[45:20] a way could have been made
[45:23] but he could have shortened brother
[45:25] branham claims and it says he said he
[45:28] failed to go dependent house he said he
[45:32] showed his colors we'll get to that now
[45:36] they may not have understood the things
[45:39] that Jesus spoke of the kingdom and the
[45:43] coming of the kingdom because they
[45:44] wondered in question everything he would
[45:46] say right every time he'd bring out a
[45:49] parable they would want him later to
[45:51] explain it they couldn't follow the
[45:54] parables that he would be giving there
[45:58] were very very simple things but they
[46:01] couldn't follow it they knew that they
[46:09] were personally called you ever heard
[46:14] this in the message I remember a brother
[46:18] they wouldn't didn't have too good of a
[46:20] batting average on his life and things
[46:23] and with this other brother said I gotta
[46:25] let him preach too called brother
[46:29] Branham ordained him I'm stating facts
[46:35] I'm worried about it just get the point
[46:38] a lot of people in this message believe
[46:42] they're safe cause brother Branham spoke
[46:44] to them about something
[46:52] brother branham told me what to preach
[46:54] this one brother he used to do that
[46:56] everywhere he went and he was one of
[46:57] those guys that remember that some of
[46:59] you ain't never heard about it but they
[47:00] had seven men they were supposed to bend
[47:02] the seven thunders you know and this was
[47:05] one of the guys that supposed to been
[47:06] one of the thunders alright and he kept
[47:10] saying that well I'm just one of them
[47:12] kind of guys it's just a little
[47:13] I don't have the determine that brother
[47:15] branham had to be able to figure out
[47:17] something figured out no but I got my
[47:19] way of doing it I'll pick you till I get
[47:21] it
[47:23] so one day I couldn't ever get him to
[47:25] answer me and and he'd say when he
[47:27] preached he said the Prophet told me
[47:29] what to preach in Iyengar preach it
[47:32] we'll never find the building what'd he
[47:35] tell him did he tell him the thunders
[47:36] did he tell him to see you did he tell
[47:38] him 7uu did he tell him this
[47:40] so I one day I just finally asking I
[47:42] listen brother I've heard you make that
[47:44] statement would you mind telling me what
[47:46] brother Ron told you to preach you know
[47:50] what he said he said brother Branham
[47:52] told me to preach hell firing it hot and
[47:56] it was exactly what he said he said
[47:59] brother round told me to preach Hellfire
[48:01] in it hot you know what he told every
[48:05] preacher ever ordained a priest hell
[48:06] fire a hot ok listen they might not have
[48:13] understood what was being taught but
[48:16] they begin to believe and they begin to
[48:20] see the signs and the miracles the
[48:22] wonders they heard his teachings and
[48:24] they begin to follow him about some of
[48:28] the things he would speak off in his
[48:30] kingdom and what it would be and they
[48:32] would say you know even one sister you
[48:35] know that my two sons might sit with
[48:37] thee in thy kingdom they'd heard so much
[48:40] about a kingdom until they were
[48:41] beginning to be concerned and they
[48:45] realized he was speaking of something
[48:47] different from what it was on earth and
[48:49] like I said about the ruler you know
[48:53] Pilate
[48:56] when he got to explaining to to to pilot
[49:00] what he was darf our pilot said no
[49:02] probably I'd like to have a whole
[49:05] kingdom full of guys like this because
[49:07] he ain't talking about anyway hindering
[49:10] me he's trying to tell my people how to
[49:12] be good now even that's paraphrasing
[49:17] words but you know what happened he
[49:19] wound up and said I find no fault in
[49:22] this man no justification for killing
[49:26] him right
[49:28] but they got overruled you know that all
[49:32] right but they saw the signs and the
[49:35] wonders they heard others commenting
[49:39] about that thou art the Christ the Son
[49:41] of the Living God was that what Peter
[49:44] said during in Matthew about 13 or 16 or
[49:48] what it in a lot of people departing to
[49:53] be the Christ the Son of the Living God
[49:54] other than just Peter but that didn't
[49:57] mean they were born again but they were
[50:00] believers you realized they held what
[50:04] they're believing for three and a half
[50:05] years they believed enough till they
[50:09] walked away from their families they
[50:10] believed enough till they quit their
[50:13] jobs they believed enough to rest with
[50:16] him and that hollering scream were you
[50:20] at when they were out on the sea because
[50:22] they knew he was the only one there
[50:24] would be any help
[50:25] right pretty good followers we'll get to
[50:31] it later pretty good believers are you
[50:36] going to tell them they were lost no I'm
[50:42] going to tell them that they're
[50:43] believing is what finally brought them
[50:45] to an upper room experience they're
[50:48] believing they're believing for the day
[50:50] they started they're calling to all of
[50:52] the time they believed him when he said
[50:54] okay I've resurrected I've done this I'm
[50:56] going away go to the upper room and wait
[51:01] you know the story they got a Pernice in
[51:04] will we order just take it by faith
[51:05] somebody said no no he told us to wait
[51:08] and we ain't got it in other words Rock
[51:12] I've always said in plain language
[51:13] somebody over in the side of where I
[51:15] said I believe we've got it we'll take
[51:17] it by faith he said okay you go out
[51:18] first there outside that door waiting to
[51:23] kill you you number one go they all sat
[51:28] down and shut up and said we ain't got
[51:30] what he said because from my
[51:32] understanding about what he was saying
[51:34] we're going to get is they get a power
[51:40] I'm on high is that what he said to him
[51:44] in the resurrection did he tell them
[51:47] they'd received these things and they
[51:51] said we ain't got it so they waited til
[51:55] they got it all right now see they
[51:59] believed until they entered the first
[52:02] stage in the plan of their salvation and
[52:06] that first stage would be
[52:11] that according to Luke I think it's 2447
[52:16] we read that repentance and remission of
[52:18] sins would be preached in his name they
[52:24] begin to believe and come to a position
[52:26] to get baptized right
[52:31] they followed on with the Lord in their
[52:36] lives but it was enough to bring them to
[52:40] a repentance and bring them to what
[52:43] would be called justification which
[52:48] would chop off their PI sins no it would
[52:58] bring them to make believers out of them
[53:01] it would bring them to a sanctification
[53:04] in Saint John 17 sanctify them through
[53:08] thy truth they had heard the truth
[53:12] they'd walk with it for three and a half
[53:14] years they were cleansed and set aside
[53:17] by that message Jesus had brought unto
[53:19] them pretty good believer pretty good
[53:25] followers gave up everything they had
[53:30] and went on with the Lord we know at
[53:34] least Peter had a wife no nobody's on
[53:38] the rest of him but Peter had a wife
[53:40] right
[53:42] he had a mother-in-law he's listed in
[53:44] the Bible you know Peter had a
[53:46] mother-in-law but listen being justified
[53:50] Roman says freely by the grace through
[53:56] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[54:01] now what brought them to repentance the
[54:04] Bible says that the goodness of God is
[54:07] what leads you to repentance and here's
[54:10] Jesus out there every day giving away
[54:14] right
[54:17] you didn't say come on fellas sneak
[54:20] around over here in the corner and I'll
[54:21] give you a little food no he said take
[54:24] everybody that's out here set them down
[54:25] with feed the whole 5000 they couldn't
[54:30] understand those things we get they
[54:32] believed it until they finally said we
[54:35] believe then nobody has to tell you
[54:40] nobody has to tell you we've got to
[54:42] place how about this oh we got that far
[54:48] we claim the baptism the Holy Ghost and
[54:50] can't lie straight out of here
[54:51] oh brother Dale you're talking about me
[54:54] yes does that solve the problem are you
[55:00] guilty yes then I you're the one I'm
[55:04] talking about
[55:06] well you ain't me code I've been here
[55:07] for years oh you did good shake come on
[55:13] get the point
[55:15] without the Holy Ghost and I quote
[55:21] brother Branham which one was it Leslie
[55:24] who did he name was a job which one was
[55:29] it
[55:29] did he 90 said he survived without the
[55:33] baptism when the Holy Ghost
[55:34] all of those of the years and how much
[55:39] more should we
[55:43] we might prove we're not believers it
[55:45] might be like I said a moment ago that I
[55:48] would to God I could preach that we
[55:49] could all realize we're lost you know
[55:52] why because we could do something about
[55:53] it if we don't realize we're lost when
[55:56] you're gonna do nothing about it we're
[55:59] gonna go right on straight to hell
[56:00] thinking we're going to have it right I
[56:07] would that I could preach that we could
[56:09] all find out you know that that sister
[56:14] on blasphemous names we would snigger at
[56:18] her he didn't realize she had the new
[56:23] birth she didn't I wouldn't a prophet it
[56:31] said she had it read blasphemous names
[56:34] and find out but you know what she was
[56:41] concerned whether she had the Holy Ghost
[56:44] because of the way he was preaching
[56:47] about the Holy Ghost she had to give the
[56:52] signs of wonders and things probably in
[56:54] her life but evidently she had caught on
[57:00] to brother branham's preaching of the
[57:03] baptism of the holy ghost and how that
[57:07] you could have these anointings
[57:09] how you could have these situations how
[57:13] that it wasn't speaking in tongues and
[57:15] wasn't signs and wonders that you depend
[57:17] on she had come to a position that she
[57:22] wondered what if she was saved on a come
[57:27] on Church he said you said well you
[57:31] bring out things I bring out something
[57:34] like that you know it's good old Baptist
[57:36] I mean a good old bad this is in here
[57:39] today don't raise your hand just because
[57:42] the rest of you don't say I ain't
[57:44] Baptist
[57:46] you know what a good old bad dish would
[57:48] say I can't now that that water baptism
[57:52] name of Lord Jesus Christ
[57:53] now you we can't go that way cause jesus
[57:57] said father son hung up and said if a
[58:00] tie and and that that one God y'all got
[58:03] you know we can't do that because
[58:06] they're quoting scripture because if we
[58:09] deny the father with the neither son
[58:14] that's Scripture maybe it might be son
[58:18] and father has crossed over but get the
[58:21] point
[58:21] it's there in the scriptures if I deny
[58:25] that I'm saved that means I'm lost you
[58:29] know what if that's the thought you got
[58:32] can I say it without hurting your
[58:34] feelings too bad and I don't care if it
[58:37] does and hope it does you are lost if
[58:40] that's all you've got
[58:43] it's a great bellowing point of unsaved
[58:49] you know my statement for 40 years I'd
[58:53] rather go all of my life seeking after
[58:55] God and find out in the end of it I had
[58:58] him all alone then to go all in my life
[59:00] and not seek after God and get down to
[59:02] the end find out I didn't have him oh
[59:03] that can't be me brother Dale I know I'm
[59:07] saved
[59:09] we getting upset about who are you
[59:12] trying to convince right who are you
[59:17] trying to convince yourself or me I
[59:22] would to God that we'd ever one read
[59:24] that blasphemous named over and over and
[59:26] get what that sister was saying she was
[59:30] really saying in other words the way
[59:32] brother Branham you're preaching it and
[59:34] the Holy Ghost said if we don't have it
[59:37] like that then we don't have it and she
[59:45] worried to whether she had it or not
[59:50] no order but I know that see I've been
[59:54] through all of it come on folks well I
[59:57] can't I can't turn out that I'm I can't
[59:59] do that I'm saved if I I won't even take
[1:00:03] no thoughts that I ain't saved that's a
[1:00:06] good statement they ain't worth two
[1:00:09] cents in the gospel I won't to see it it
[1:00:17] was always in the Bible we need we need
[1:00:19] brother brother said we got too much is
[1:00:22] that his word at far we're afraid to
[1:00:28] listen that's what people don't want to
[1:00:30] listen brother that afraid to listen to
[1:00:32] me the afraid they might wind up against
[1:00:35] a brick wall somewhere and don't know
[1:00:37] whether they're saved or not well that's
[1:00:42] alright now I'll keep right on preaching
[1:00:46] it don't Teil something happens either
[1:00:48] way but therefore being justified freely
[1:00:52] by faith we have a redemptive part to
[1:00:58] come with Jesus Christ all right but
[1:01:01] what about the disciples no what about
[1:01:05] the disciples or were they the disciples
[1:01:10] and what did the three and a half years
[1:01:13] finally bring him to what about it it
[1:01:20] wasn't just you to sit left you remember
[1:01:22] they're saving the others you know
[1:01:26] remember there was a lot of people in
[1:01:28] there that left and you know there's a
[1:01:31] lot of them I'd like the way brother
[1:01:33] Bradley straightened out as he was
[1:01:34] appalled with the what was the one Paul
[1:01:37] did enough he know the one that went
[1:01:43] away from him
[1:01:45] Dimas but Wren said I don't think Dimas
[1:01:48] went back in the world
[1:01:51] he didn't go anymore
[1:01:54] nopal did but all right now listen
[1:01:59] listen to what your prophet says that
[1:02:02] three and a half years of the minister
[1:02:06] Jesus Christ brought the disciples to a
[1:02:10] great position okay go ahead to number
[1:02:20] one questions and answers
[1:02:22] 19:54 and law having a shadow you talked
[1:02:28] about the Christian Brothers and the
[1:02:29] things you know in the new Durst that
[1:02:31] Jesus told Peter after he would been the
[1:02:35] apostle of them they've been justified
[1:02:38] by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:44] now whatever you want to put their
[1:02:46] justification chop off your Pisceans
[1:02:49] whatever lump it to whatever thought you
[1:02:52] want it simply means it goes through all
[1:02:54] that a justification chops off you pi
[1:02:56] sins they'd been sanctified through the
[1:03:02] truth
[1:03:05] he was the truth then he said and give
[1:03:08] them power they went forth to preach the
[1:03:11] gospel they begun great gifts that was
[1:03:14] in them was being made anybody read was
[1:03:21] it's a great gifts and things was being
[1:03:26] made super early or in a shallow way
[1:03:40] in other words in a shallow way
[1:03:41] manifested but he said now the next
[1:03:44] thing you got to do is to make this
[1:03:47] thing grow with the disciples they were
[1:03:53] justified by believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:03:56] Christ
[1:03:58] they were sanctified through the truth
[1:04:01] and he was the truth and they got 3.5
[1:04:05] years of ministry for that to sanctified
[1:04:17] okay
[1:04:22] what about this one go ahead number two
[1:04:27] questions and answers on Genesis there
[1:04:33] was Judas Iscariot was justified by
[1:04:39] faith and believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ and was baptized the Bible said
[1:04:50] Jesus baptizing disciples his disciples
[1:04:54] all right now instead of listening to
[1:04:56] anything you know what happens when that
[1:04:58] statements read well I I think did Jesus
[1:05:02] baptized the disciple drew the disciple
[1:05:03] baptized Jesus or who baptized who or
[1:05:05] who got to see right now some of yous
[1:05:09] done cut off any thought about Judas
[1:05:12] being right there you didn't got in to
[1:05:14] arguing over whether Jesus baptized them
[1:05:17] or they baptized each other or what
[1:05:19] happened here with art that's the great
[1:05:21] message people well brother Dale I
[1:05:27] didn't think of that and maybe somebody
[1:05:30] else to you the Bible said Jesus
[1:05:33] baptized her to stop of Jews John all
[1:05:35] right John 17:17 before he could send
[1:05:40] them out he said sanctify them father
[1:05:41] through the truth before we sent him out
[1:05:44] now thy word is the truth and he was the
[1:05:48] word even before the atonement was made
[1:05:50] in other words as a preview father of my
[1:05:56] shed blood I sanctify them i watch him
[1:06:02] he gave them power against unclean
[1:06:05] spirits and they went out and they cast
[1:06:07] out Devils is that right
[1:06:09] and they healed the sick that right and
[1:06:11] they come back sanctified rejoicing
[1:06:14] jumping shouting and praising God is
[1:06:16] that right and said even the devil's is
[1:06:19] subject to us
[1:06:24] and Jesus said don't you rejoice because
[1:06:28] the Devils are subject you but rejoice
[1:06:30] because your names are written in the
[1:06:32] book of heaven is that right and Judas
[1:06:37] Iscariot was right with them one of them
[1:06:40] called out sanctified in his name
[1:06:47] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:51] even it couldn't be in the last look
[1:06:53] like it had to be there it's gotta be
[1:06:54] there see you stopped again you've cut
[1:06:57] the whole thing off you're not listening
[1:06:58] to the message read Matthew 10 and see
[1:07:01] if that's not right
[1:07:02] he called each one of them and Judas and
[1:07:05] every one of them right down there he
[1:07:08] sent them out giving them power against
[1:07:10] unclean spirit that was before Calvary
[1:07:12] now come on he gave them power and Judas
[1:07:16] Iscariot was right there woodland and
[1:07:20] Judas went to justification and
[1:07:22] sanctification
[1:07:36] okay go ahead to the next one mark of
[1:07:40] the beast and the seal of God he called
[1:07:45] his disciples by justification he
[1:07:48] sanctified them in st. John 17:17 gave
[1:07:52] them power against unclean spirits and
[1:07:54] they went out and cast out devils come
[1:07:56] back rejoicing you know don't worry John
[1:07:58] Judas was just a bigger duck in the pond
[1:08:01] as the rest of them was he come right
[1:08:05] along through justification went out
[1:08:08] through sanctification prayed for the
[1:08:11] sick had gave great results but when he
[1:08:14] come to Pentecost he showed his colors
[1:08:20] Judas the God we think was a crook that
[1:08:26] we think was all of this I've preached
[1:08:28] my understanding of that come on I can
[1:08:32] read the Bible to you when they were in
[1:08:34] the upper room the spirit entered Judas
[1:08:40] ricci Bible I'm talking about the holy
[1:08:45] spirit that the spirit entered Judas and
[1:08:48] took him away you know he was doing a
[1:08:52] pretty good job and killed in oh yeah he
[1:08:54] was a crook all the time but only Jesus
[1:08:56] knew what he was all right are you
[1:08:58] following me
[1:09:00] now listen to what he says number four I
[1:09:07] got them set up two we're gonna flip
[1:09:09] flop in a minute because of a point I'm
[1:09:11] wanting to bring and look what he says
[1:09:17] now man told me one day he said I can't
[1:09:19] see that I said I can you can be
[1:09:24] sanctified
[1:09:27] without being justified
[1:09:35] we spend all the rest of the evening
[1:09:37] talking on that he didn't say you can be
[1:09:42] sanctified I justified that being you
[1:09:44] know he what they say you me sanctified
[1:09:46] without being justified you can be
[1:09:48] justified without being sanctified you
[1:09:51] can be sanctified without receiving the
[1:09:53] Holy Ghost that's exactly and John
[1:09:55] dopplers and John was sanctified to give
[1:09:57] the power to cast out devils and still
[1:09:59] doubt didn't have the Holy Ghost he sure
[1:10:04] had to go up to Pentecost and wait till
[1:10:06] the Holy Ghost come that's where Judas
[1:10:08] showed his colors see how that spirit
[1:10:12] worked its way through justification and
[1:10:15] sanctification but when it come to the
[1:10:19] end he showed his colors now he called
[1:10:22] to the Spirit worked his way up through
[1:10:26] that Judas is character
[1:10:35] we know that justification means chops
[1:10:37] off you pass in sanctification means
[1:10:40] cleanse and set aside sanctification
[1:10:46] really if you only get down to it and
[1:10:49] break it on down that's true the opening
[1:10:51] of the word but you realize
[1:10:53] sanctification is a point to work that
[1:10:56] the word comes within you and takes out
[1:10:58] the things that you were doing is that
[1:11:01] clear enough see justification chops off
[1:11:05] your pie sins you believe on the Lord
[1:11:06] Jesus Christ brother Branham says a few
[1:11:08] strong he said it does nothing to your
[1:11:09] nature
[1:11:10] he said all it does is remit your sins
[1:11:13] sanctification starts to working upon
[1:11:15] your nature because it starts a
[1:11:18] cleansing and you can have people to
[1:11:20] quit drinking quit smoking quit line
[1:11:22] quit stealing and still committing
[1:11:24] adultery till you can be sanctified not
[1:11:31] be totally justified no problem your
[1:11:34] prophets not wrong you just give him a
[1:11:36] little time to think about what he's
[1:11:39] saying it'll come out but not think
[1:11:43] about it we all know these scriptures
[1:11:45] but do we realize it okay good number
[1:11:50] five now we know in John what it says
[1:11:53] because he said he said to her the Holy
[1:11:54] Ghost still had not been given all right
[1:11:57] now we know what it says he believed it
[1:11:59] only in the scripture has said out of
[1:12:00] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:12:02] water but this spake he of the Spirit
[1:12:04] which they that believe on him should
[1:12:06] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:12:10] given because that Jesus was not yet
[1:12:13] glorified now you got to come to the
[1:12:18] death burial resurrection glorification
[1:12:21] we were tested discussing this going
[1:12:23] over to the minister the
[1:12:26] meeting yesterday and he had to go up he
[1:12:32] told Mary don't touch me I'm not yet
[1:12:33] ascended he had to go up deposit the
[1:12:37] body lift it on the throne then he could
[1:12:41] come back
[1:12:45] to be with the disciples now be careful
[1:12:50] you ain't listening he went up and left
[1:12:55] the body what came back to earth the
[1:13:02] glorified body but did that do away with
[1:13:05] the body laying on the throne oh you're
[1:13:08] missing it you got to have the body
[1:13:10] laying on the throne for the pay in the
[1:13:13] prize leave it on the throne until it
[1:13:16] rises to come again and then we meet him
[1:13:19] in the air see the message is right but
[1:13:24] we get it all into our won't understand
[1:13:27] this what does that make it wrong does
[1:13:33] that make it wrong cuz we don't
[1:13:34] understand it I mean we had eggs and
[1:13:37] toast this morning for breakfast well I
[1:13:39] don't understand how that goes in my
[1:13:40] systems and does all these like
[1:13:42] especially the one I don't understand
[1:13:43] know life when it makes me fat I've got
[1:13:49] so fat until my belly button sticking
[1:13:51] out and I happened to be sitting with my
[1:13:54] shirt pulled over to the side the other
[1:13:56] day and little Lilly looked over the
[1:13:59] iron she said Papa you know how no belly
[1:14:03] button I said I do is just pushed out
[1:14:06] honey it's your life where you're
[1:14:12] thinking settle you down to where you're
[1:14:15] thinking okay that's the purpose of
[1:14:17] doing that you'll find out one of these
[1:14:20] days all great speakers have an ability
[1:14:22] to make you like for a minute to try to
[1:14:24] clear your thoughts to where you'll sit
[1:14:25] down and listen so I'm one of the great
[1:14:28] speakers okay that's good go ahead a
[1:14:32] number see it let's get started let's
[1:14:33] get a thought all right look what he
[1:14:38] said on the unveiling of God before any
[1:14:41] man walked in behind that veil now watch
[1:14:50] it was sudden death anybody let us show
[1:14:58] you they didn't have eternal life back
[1:14:59] guard listen that right there is enough
[1:15:02] if you don't believe it if you're still
[1:15:04] questioning whether it had he turn alive
[1:15:06] in the Old Testament remember if that
[1:15:07] had eternal life I'm quoting the rest of
[1:15:10] it in a minute if they had eternal life
[1:15:13] they could walk behind the veil because
[1:15:15] you now in the New Testament if you do
[1:15:18] not go behind the veil you're lost in
[1:15:22] the Old Testament you went behind the
[1:15:24] veil you was dead in the New Testament
[1:15:27] quoting brother Branham so you do what
[1:15:29] you thought he said we don't go behind
[1:15:32] the veil now he said well off he's the
[1:15:34] words once death to go behind he said
[1:15:36] now it's death to not go behind I'm
[1:15:39] quoting him so come on we look but if
[1:15:44] any man walk behind that veil it was
[1:15:45] sudden death why cause the blood of
[1:15:48] bulls and goats and all that what you're
[1:15:54] gonna get a lesson here in a minute see
[1:15:55] if you can if you can receive it to walk
[1:15:58] behind him skins even one of the priests
[1:16:00] sons tried to do it one time and died
[1:16:02] don't go behind that veil the man that
[1:16:06] walked behind why there was no
[1:16:08] redemption yet in that there's no
[1:16:16] redemption yet in that it was
[1:16:20] potentially
[1:16:28] in the Old Testament Redemption was
[1:16:32] potential or potentially which I think
[1:16:38] it's in here or if not we'll get in a
[1:16:40] minute the word potentially means it's
[1:16:43] not exactly the full story but remember
[1:16:48] potentially is a type of an answer type
[1:16:56] potentially it means you have the
[1:16:59] beginning of what you need if you want
[1:17:03] an oak tree and I give you an acorn what
[1:17:07] have you got potentially you've got an
[1:17:11] oak tree but what if you want an oak
[1:17:13] tree and I give your watermelon seed it
[1:17:17] don't work so remember my story over and
[1:17:23] over all the Old Testament tops of the
[1:17:25] new all it was back here you can't
[1:17:28] change it when you come over here
[1:17:31] there's got to be a further advancement
[1:17:34] or we'll get we'll get to it today I
[1:17:36] don't know what I'm gonna finish this
[1:17:37] but we'll get to it the Lord within next
[1:17:40] weekend of partial realization compared
[1:17:45] to perfect realization remember whatever
[1:17:50] worked back tyre for Dean was got to be
[1:17:51] working for us now but it's just a
[1:17:53] deeper meaning everybody with me don't
[1:17:57] look what he said even one of the
[1:17:59] priests went behind her he don't he died
[1:18:01] while there was no redemption yet in
[1:18:04] that it was potentially it was just
[1:18:07] potential in anything Meredith anything
[1:18:09] potential is not the real thing yet he
[1:18:14] didn't say it wasn't real
[1:18:15] it's not the real thing yet you get in a
[1:18:21] little boat and you go down the lake
[1:18:24] it ain't yet a big ocean liner but it's
[1:18:29] a travel mechanism come on
[1:18:33] anything potential is not the real time
[1:18:35] yet see
[1:18:37] just potentially it was redemptions not
[1:18:41] sins was covered now what's he not owe
[1:18:44] me didn't he change it remitted rather
[1:18:46] not remitted remitted is divorced and
[1:18:50] put away and so the blood of sheep and
[1:18:52] goats could not do that
[1:18:54] so Jehovah was hid behind a veil and now
[1:18:58] back behind this veil where he was hid
[1:19:01] to enter into that a man drop dead to
[1:19:05] try to enter but - now if we don't go
[1:19:08] behind the veil we're already dead the
[1:19:13] only way you can get born again is go
[1:19:14] behind the veil okay all right let me
[1:19:18] check see if I can stop
[1:19:26] okay let's get the next one and we'll
[1:19:28] quit because this is where I told him
[1:19:30] we'd flip-flop okay
[1:19:31] number seven taken from the Mesa Jesus
[1:19:35] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:19:36] forever
[1:19:37] now the prophets could not be sanctified
[1:19:42] now listen then he says potentially now
[1:19:46] he'll explain it they were potentially
[1:19:48] the prophets were potentially sanctified
[1:19:51] now you'll see that in a minute because
[1:19:53] that's just when he stopped it he was
[1:19:55] making his stopping and he's bought
[1:19:57] backed up do you read it for yourself
[1:19:59] come on look now the prophets could not
[1:20:02] be sanctified potentially by the
[1:20:05] offering of a bull or an ox or something
[1:20:07] or sheep or a heifer they were
[1:20:10] potentially under that blood as a
[1:20:13] brother both gallantly as presented that
[1:20:16] they could be sanctified potentially
[1:20:19] under looking forward to the atonement
[1:20:24] being made perfect for under the blood
[1:20:28] of bulls and when the bull died or the
[1:20:32] heifer died or the Sheep died the life
[1:20:35] in that blood could not come back on the
[1:20:37] prophet because it was animal's life an
[1:20:41] animal's life would not bring the profit
[1:20:44] to an animal now listen in the Old
[1:20:51] Testament they were potential that's the
[1:20:54] type of shadow keep that thought there's
[1:20:57] a lot more than you that have this notes
[1:20:59] hold on to them those are gonna need
[1:21:02] them next Sunday don't have to rerun
[1:21:03] them potentially is something that's we
[1:21:10] think potentially is something that's
[1:21:12] not real but no no you're getting at it
[1:21:14] wrong way if you say you have an O an
[1:21:17] acorn potentially you have an oak tree
[1:21:21] which you got a lot to go through to get
[1:21:23] the oak tree but now you can't start
[1:21:25] without the Acorn for the oak tree right
[1:21:29] so the Old Testament salvation now
[1:21:32] listen was under the blood of bulls and
[1:21:34] goats
[1:21:38] Jesus Christ had not been crucified so
[1:21:43] until that come forward they were only
[1:21:47] potentially justified
[1:21:55] and potentially sanctified they never
[1:21:59] received the baptism with all the ghosts
[1:22:01] no and what they had was enough to hold
[1:22:06] them for the time but not enough to
[1:22:12] bring Redemption to the full plan all
[1:22:16] right
[1:22:17] so think about potentially you know that
[1:22:20] the Bible speaks of it in the Prophet
[1:22:22] says we're potentially raised so you see
[1:22:27] where we're going
[1:22:28] we're potentially right what you know
[1:22:30] what we still here hey you know but
[1:22:34] saying you're potentially raised don't
[1:22:35] raise yet one foot right you still here
[1:22:41] but we're potentially now you want to
[1:22:44] deny what you got no because I got what
[1:22:48] will take me to the perfect reality -
[1:22:54] we'll back up to partial realization
[1:22:57] comparing with perfect realization and
[1:23:00] bring out a few thoughts potentially
[1:23:05] those Old Testament Saints because under
[1:23:10] the blood of bulls and goats you could
[1:23:13] only have a potential now don't worry
[1:23:19] about it
[1:23:20] I've got what the Prophet said so we'll
[1:23:24] just keep on going you know
[1:23:31] that Adam
[1:23:37] potentially I had to hold a go
[1:23:43] I'm quoting brother branham I'll let you
[1:23:45] wait you they've gotten the message just
[1:23:47] don't buy some round too much lately you
[1:23:50] can read it I didn't say that your
[1:23:53] prophet did
[1:23:55] what is it potential then brother Dale
[1:23:59] it's something that you start with but
[1:24:05] remember in the oak tree you start with
[1:24:09] the Acorn that's just as real as the oak
[1:24:12] tree it just ain't come into being yet
[1:24:18] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:21] right here at faith and born again
[1:24:24] potentially you have these things but
[1:24:29] they're not in manifestation you have a
[1:24:33] part of these things a potential a
[1:24:41] potential you have the part of these
[1:24:43] things but you don't have it in full
[1:24:45] reality you said brother Dale you the
[1:24:49] way you talk see the new birth that you
[1:24:51] receive the new birth the 3,000 outside
[1:24:54] received on the day of Pentecost was the
[1:24:59] eternal life into the body of Jesus
[1:25:02] Christ by salvation we were the only
[1:25:05] potential to watch 120 had from the
[1:25:07] upper room
[1:25:11] why because they'd been taught three and
[1:25:13] a half years and the Holy Ghost fell put
[1:25:16] them where it said Holy Spirit on the
[1:25:18] pyramid I'm quoting brother Branham but
[1:25:21] see the five they're the three thousand
[1:25:22] outside only received a new birth but it
[1:25:26] made them sealed into the body of Christ
[1:25:30] don't you wish you could think about
[1:25:33] that we were all full-grown wouldn't it
[1:25:37] be something to think I'm a fool growing
[1:25:39] in the God brother Dale I'll tell you
[1:25:41] what I got everything like I told y'all
[1:25:44] sitting with two brothers one time one
[1:25:46] of them said I got everything when I
[1:25:48] believed in this message and got the
[1:25:50] whole ego said I got everything I don't
[1:25:54] have to get nothing the other brother
[1:25:57] looked at him and said when you've got
[1:25:59] whatever you got you didn't get all of
[1:26:02] it and you don't have it yet I said with
[1:26:08] y'all two brothers mind if I stay in the
[1:26:10] middle between the two of you no you
[1:26:18] said you got everything
[1:26:19] and you said he ain't got nothing I said
[1:26:22] you mind if I stay in the middle and
[1:26:25] believe that that brothers got a point
[1:26:27] about what he said and that brothers got
[1:26:29] a point about what he's saying but you
[1:26:31] got to get them together in the middle
[1:26:32] somewhere what about it you asked me for
[1:26:40] an oak tree
[1:26:41] I'll give you an acre have you ever
[1:26:47] studied the message just enough to know
[1:26:50] you know the Lutheran's potentially now
[1:26:56] this is one's gonna take a while to
[1:26:57] explain I don't call him brother Brandon
[1:27:00] the Lutheran's potentially had the Holy
[1:27:03] Spirit
[1:27:07] now you tell me that the Lutheran didn't
[1:27:10] have the Newburgh now you you sell me
[1:27:12] brother Brown I'm saying that the
[1:27:13] Lutheran didn't have nothing I'll quote
[1:27:15] you the big man from down south years
[1:27:17] ago said he couldn't preach no era stood
[1:27:19] right here and said he said them
[1:27:21] Pentecostals said David sweat for false
[1:27:24] I had just explained it to him in the
[1:27:27] building down and look and gills will
[1:27:28] lower heat and supper code he'd made
[1:27:30] that statement I said brother I said
[1:27:33] brother branham said them elusive Street
[1:27:35] Pentecost had the baptism when the Holy
[1:27:37] Ghost the genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:27:39] Ghost
[1:27:39] that come on the day of Pentecost he
[1:27:42] come right here and said they didn't
[1:27:46] have it you know what that didn't change
[1:27:49] me to believe what he said I believe
[1:27:54] what brother around say I may not be
[1:27:57] able to explain it may I be like this
[1:27:59] started off with the Apostles come on
[1:28:00] musician maybe like I started off with
[1:28:02] the Apostles they didn't understand
[1:28:04] everything Jesus talking about but they
[1:28:07] knew enough to say one time where can we
[1:28:10] go thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:28:14] and work and we go that's all I've ever
[1:28:19] said in this message I don't understand
[1:28:21] everything though where can we go you
[1:28:24] tell me that some man I thought we
[1:28:26] supposed to follow some guy over here
[1:28:29] something over there
[1:28:30] I just can't follow them I just can't go
[1:28:35] that route why the ACOTA I can't believe
[1:28:39] the way they believe that's what I told
[1:28:41] it to so man when he was trying to I
[1:28:43] said I'm not saying you're wrong I'm
[1:28:45] just saying I don't believe what you say
[1:28:47] I can't understand what you're saying I
[1:28:50] said but now I'm not gonna tell you
[1:28:53] you're wrong that's when you and God but
[1:28:55] I'm gonna tell you that I don't believe
[1:28:56] it that way I don't understand you
[1:28:58] better what well what else could I say
[1:29:04] let's stand together do you know what
[1:29:06] potentially a study potential or
[1:29:07] potentially cause potential will carry
[1:29:10] your potential as a point if you just
[1:29:12] look in the word potential it's gonna
[1:29:14] carry you to a point like your way over
[1:29:16] here and and you ain't over there
[1:29:18] potentially is
[1:29:20] you've already got it started but you
[1:29:23] need to go more and lower into what you
[1:29:28] got
[1:29:28] so everybody understand potentially what
[1:29:30] I'm done by you got ourselves to start
[1:29:33] with are you gonna have something in the
[1:29:34] end so potentially when you got the Holy
[1:29:38] Ghost you got all you needed better on
[1:29:40] sale he said when you got the baptism of
[1:29:43] the Holy Ghost you got all you needed
[1:29:46] well bless God I don't have to go to
[1:29:47] church I don't have to do nothing I just
[1:29:50] sit at home and help me a good time cuz
[1:29:55] he told me I had everything why don't
[1:30:01] you hear people quoting stuff like that
[1:30:03] what do we got 217 anybody have a need
[1:30:13] you have a need
[1:30:19] when you play if the potential industry
