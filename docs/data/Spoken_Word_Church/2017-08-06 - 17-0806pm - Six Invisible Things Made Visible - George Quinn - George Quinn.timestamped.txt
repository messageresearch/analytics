[8:34] let's all stand near the cross our watts
[8:41] and way things are stinging
[8:50] ever
[8:52] till I reach the golden strand jump
[9:02] beyond array
[9:08] in the cross in the cross be my glory
[9:23] I feel my wrath
[9:28] sure so we shall find rest we are a man
[9:41] and a man all those in the collagen
[9:47] that's where everything was made
[9:49] possible south across a man enjoyed the
[9:52] message this morning a man he's already
[9:54] this afternoon her brothers speaking the
[9:56] word of the Lord and to us to bring us
[9:58] to word would be for the hour that we
[10:01] live in the time right now we always
[10:03] wear the Queen as I said this morning he
[10:06] does not take his he might not want me
[10:08] to say a lot of things about but I tell
[10:10] it like it is he doesn't take his money
[10:12] when he goes out I mean our money that
[10:15] we give him when he goes out on the
[10:16] missionary field he pays his own
[10:18] expenses but then when we give him he
[10:21] gives away to buildings or whatever you
[10:24] know building houses doing whatever he
[10:26] wants to buying food for the people so
[10:29] if anything you want to give him extra
[10:30] feel free to give it to it because that
[10:33] would be fine there's nothing but we
[10:35] always try to give some to work that he
[10:37] can go and do so is it all right with
[10:40] the church if we give him like twenty
[10:42] five hundred dollars to be able to just
[10:44] spend out in the missionary you know
[10:46] whatever he feels could be you know
[10:50] sufficient for him and what he does if
[10:53] he needs anything that we give him he's
[10:55] always I told him you feel free to use
[10:57] that money
[10:57] something you need something goes in are
[11:00] you take care of it and all this alright
[11:02] but I'll know him the way he is he goes
[11:05] on it on and takes care of it we
[11:07] appreciate that appreciate his stand for
[11:09] the truth the hour that we're living in
[11:11] the things and trying to cure the
[11:13] message to the world it's getting
[11:15] tighter and tighter you've heard two
[11:17] reports already of the government forces
[11:21] trying to step in one through the other

[11:28] little tighter belts on things so it'll
[11:31] get that away I wasn't working on it

[20:44] that's not the way it seems she says I
[20:46] wish he would hurry up and quit that I

[20:51] said just as she said that I quoted
[20:54] something from brother Branham and she
[20:56] said there was a lovely she told about
[20:57] our needs you know she said there was a
[20:59] lovely sweep over her and was all gone

[21:06] is and I'm glad hallelujah
[21:08] we're in a wonderful word today during
[21:11] the word of this hour where would you
[21:13] want to be other than in the brain of
[21:14] Jesus Christ where would you want to be
[21:16] hallelujah nowhere at all amen so praise
[21:19] the Lord
[21:20] I'm so glad about that there amen night
[21:22] I just do this here of domain and then
[21:25] that keeps a little thing and and place
[21:28] amen you know what the day of the camp
[21:30] meetings we respond spoke this the other
[21:32] morning we got the opportunity to speak
[21:34] at the camp meetings in the morning time
[21:36] for one service and you know I was just
[21:39] saying that to me the meetings were
[21:42] actually that I believe that God wanted
[21:45] to reveal himself to show hard grit
[21:47] here's the show hard gritty yes and we
[21:49] could never think that he's not too
[21:52] great but his greatness you know we
[21:54] could never think highly enough of that
[21:56] that he's a great god and he's a good
[21:58] god amen and he's the one whose
[22:02] greatness abides in us we were talking
[22:06] about the word being in you that's
[22:07] Christ amen of that words in you there's
[22:10] greatness in you
[22:11] amen and I think we were talking about
[22:13] it earlier with already planning to talk
[22:15] a few places in the existence when he
[22:17] gets there event and I hope you join him
[22:20] and did you know it's wonderful who we
[22:22] are and God's purposes when you look at
[22:26] your life and look at God's purposes you
[22:29] could never know enough that God what
[22:32] he's purpose for you like really every
[22:36] step of your life every part of your
[22:38] life he's got a purpose in it you know
[22:41] what I mean and and sometimes you might
[22:43] say or forgot the keys and go back into
[22:45] the house then you get the keys jumping
[22:47] in the automobile how do you know there
[22:49] wasn't just going to be a rack down
[22:51] there and you missed it because we're
[22:53] talking about the Angels you missed it
[22:55] things like that but God has got a
[22:57] purpose amen and that's a wonderful
[22:58] thing to know and every is a simple
[23:00] speed deal said how could he be planning
[23:02] like that but he's God you know if he
[23:05] knows how many you take every squirrel
[23:07] in America and God knows how many things
[23:09] just spotted aside today he could tell
[23:11] you so he knows the smallest detail of
[23:14] your life
[23:15] so that's wonderful amen to know that
[23:18] amen 9 I'm glad well you actually can't
[23:21] see it maybe I don't know if you could
[23:23] raise that or not yeah okay because
[23:25] we'll come to just in a while but I was
[23:27] really glad to see this little thing
[23:29] today the Ark of the Covenant but you
[23:33] know I this just came to me a man your
[23:36] brother branham talks about heart a
[23:37] minister gets the messages and you know
[23:39] gets quiet and just begins to think and
[23:42] study and think what god I knew it gives
[23:45] you maybe a thought and you start to
[23:47] develop it and and this is what comes in
[23:50] your message but that message will then
[23:52] you go to the the prophet and then
[23:54] you'll get what what he says about the
[23:56] different things and is such a blessing
[23:58] amen and this this part of the scripture
[24:01] here what we just read amen and we're
[24:05] going to look at it and a bit of depth
[24:07] and a moment but I is called six
[24:10] invisible things made visible once I got
[24:13] this one this was the first one that
[24:16] there was an invisibility you know
[24:18] you've seen a blank screen there there
[24:20] was nothing on it
[24:20] amen but if you see something then began
[24:24] to be projected onto it and Mead then it
[24:28] shows you something amen
[24:30] and it's the same when you look at the
[24:31] universe you know it wasn't there
[24:34] one stance and I it was there amen
[24:38] it was invisible it became visible and
[24:41] you see God's great eternal Godhead and
[24:44] power to do it amen I'm so glad to see
[24:46] the younger people in here today as well
[24:48] and God bless you amen
[24:50] as you serve him with all your heart I
[24:53] was 15 years of age when I started to
[24:55] serve the Lord 18 years of age amen I've
[24:57] never regretted not never regretted not
[24:59] amen so prison Lord amen for the
[25:02] invisible things of him from the
[25:05] creation of the world are clearly seen
[25:08] the invisible things clearly seen being
[25:11] understood amen by the things which are
[25:15] made amen
[25:17] the things which are made if it's
[25:19] invisible you don't know what it is what
[25:21] if something's made you know what it is
[25:23] prison or disfigure it's like an artist
[25:26] amen
[25:27] and praise the Lord working from nothing
[25:30] and then what he creates or a sculptor
[25:33] what he creates then you know amen
[25:36] what it is what would what his thoughts
[25:38] were and it's the same with God with God
[25:41] to mate I remember reading about one of
[25:44] England's famous painters his name was
[25:47] Turner and he was had quite a famous
[25:49] name and that this lynnie of the realm
[25:53] came to visit him a man knew that her
[25:55] servants brought her and her carriage
[25:57] and all that and she looked at his work
[26:00] and she said mr. Turner
[26:03] she says I do not see what you put in to
[26:08] that finding of a teacher and whatever
[26:11] it is and he just looked at her and he
[26:13] said ah he said but mom do you not wish
[26:17] you could see his he made encima he hid
[26:22] but he could see a tenor
[26:23] so it's wonderful amen I also in the
[26:26] Bible and talks about Hebrews 11 though
[26:29] we a through faith we understand that
[26:31] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[26:34] God a spoken word creation that he
[26:37] believed his own word amen and so prison
[26:40] Lord was framed by God by the Word of
[26:42] God and may I add from the eternal mind
[26:45] of God I'm the intelligent God then
[26:48] intelligence on his perfect wealth
[26:50] though a lot was free him by him amen
[26:52] the Sun the Moon the Stars the planets
[26:54] everything the whole universe and there
[26:56] was nothing made that was not made but
[26:59] by him amen so praise the Lord and it
[27:02] was made from things that do not appear
[27:05] you know it is we do not see out of well
[27:07] we do see items when we see ourselves
[27:09] but you know we don't see that them
[27:11] certain wheels going through the
[27:12] building and things like that and you
[27:14] know it's invisible to us but they're
[27:16] real they are real I'm so prison Lord
[27:19] amen by things that do not appear the
[27:23] invisible items the law of gravity
[27:25] electromagnetism we don't see it but
[27:28] it's there Prince the Lord not at the
[27:30] beginning only the Eternal Spirit all
[27:33] was invisible you know even Paul says it
[27:35] in the New Testament on to the king
[27:37] eternal immortal invisible that God only
[27:40] wise amen be honor and glory for ever
[27:43] and ever amen so when he speaks there
[27:46] comes a creation the cherubim the
[27:49] sovereign and Archangels the universe
[27:52] mine the world everything the earth and
[27:56] man on it praise God when he spoke he
[27:58] spoke at all and existence amen and then
[28:01] may I say that I never really thought it
[28:05] but a brother branham said the cherubims
[28:06] they are the guards around the throne
[28:08] and then I was wondering about the sort
[28:11] of films not too hard remember I
[28:13] wondered about them and you know I the
[28:16] answer really was that and Isaiah
[28:19] chapter 6 I believe it is when Isaiah
[28:21] saw the Lord High and lifted up it was a
[28:24] Seraphim that came and took the coal
[28:27] from off the altar so that the cherubim
[28:30] are the throne that Seraphim are the
[28:33] altar they are the guards of the altar
[28:35] they are to do with the altar worship
[28:37] amen
[28:38] so prison Lord for that nine if I may
[28:41] read your quote he said I'm funny enough
[28:45] this is wonderful because when I was
[28:47] asked to speak on Friday morning I had
[28:51] this quote this quote was there to be
[28:52] printed off and I had it and I did not
[28:55] realize that that brother Craig Brewer
[28:58] the night before would would actually be
[29:00] written from this here
[29:01] so it was so the continuity of the holy
[29:04] spirit was so wonderful no I and I have
[29:06] heard but now I see one of my favorites
[29:09] I love that one of my favorite you know
[29:12] the Bible says Kirsten see you know
[29:15] maybe some of our young people thinking
[29:16] well I I don't see in it but my mom or
[29:19] my dad sees in that well you test in see
[29:21] and find out of us it was evidence to
[29:23] see him for your mom and dad that they a
[29:25] little bit you'll love it have you
[29:26] really kissed and see it no so he said I
[29:29] could he this is job truly go to his
[29:32] house and knock on the door say this
[29:35] this man had suffered where would he
[29:37] open the door and talk with him a while
[29:39] and then when the inspiration dropped in
[29:42] his heart then he could see God the
[29:45] lights are flashing the thunders are
[29:47] going and when a dead he stood upon his
[29:49] feet and said I know my redeemer liveth
[29:52] my Redeemer at the last days you'll
[29:54] stand on the earth see he had to begin
[29:57] to see God's reaction to his fear and
[30:01] you know I may not know a lot but I'll
[30:04] tell you one thing I know this much that
[30:06] there is never a time in your life where
[30:09] God will not react to your faith never
[30:12] if you have faith in God for something
[30:14] and you really have it
[30:15] God will react to it because that able
[30:18] react to your for you think he did with
[30:19] you know
[30:21] so prison Lord Amy and 9 we wonder if we
[30:24] could see God is there a way that we
[30:26] could see him because he's it was
[30:28] invisible
[30:28] see and he says is there a way that we
[30:31] could see him no he said oh no he said
[30:37] it was the only way God had try and
[30:40] Jocasta the way says it trying Joubert
[30:43] so he will try you he will test you we
[30:45] know that and he said I have heard of me
[30:48] with the hearing of the ear but now I
[30:51] see thee and now I see them with my eyes
[30:55] the vision of the invisible had been
[30:59] made clean no he seen the crater rollin
[31:03] he heard the the flushing of the
[31:05] Lightning and saw it and saw the roaring
[31:07] of the Thunder on a clear day he seen
[31:10] God wasn't not cleared and then not
[31:12] lightning just like Ezekiel and he could
[31:14] see go
[31:15] with his natural eye and the way brother
[31:19] Branham says it exactly the way we read
[31:21] it
[31:21] he says amen and the invisible became
[31:27] visible so that's that that's what I
[31:30] wanted to just that thought this
[31:32] afternoon
[31:33] amen the visible vision of others was
[31:37] then vindicated clear to him to the nuts
[31:39] your life Amen I heard of you but now I
[31:42] see you amen
[31:43] and so praise God for that amen and just
[31:46] like faith with works as he spoke one
[31:48] last night about Abraham but we're not
[31:51] going to that but the visible became
[31:54] visible to Joe and he could react to
[31:57] that amen praise the Lord and he was
[31:59] restored back to a full house as you as

[34:06] this about Colorado I've never been
[34:07] there a number flying over at one time
[34:09] and you know you're looking away down
[34:11] and then all of a sudden you're looking
[34:13] down on this city and it's not so far
[34:15] below you so I think I said I I believe
[34:18] that's uh in Colorado what's what's the
[34:21] capital Memphis no Denver Denver
[34:23] Colorado so I asked one of the
[34:25] attendants and she says sir I don't know

[34:29] asked the pilot and he came down said
[34:30] yeah that was Denver Colorado so I got
[34:33] that close to it but I never got up but
[34:35] do you know something we're talking
[34:36] today I would love it wouldn't you're
[34:39] not gonna do me much you know what would
[34:41] you for you but just to where brother
[34:43] branham spoke that storm away I'd love
[34:44] to stand there just think of the
[34:47] greatness of God that day that was
[34:49] manifested there Amen praise the Lord
[34:51] and a you know I I said to my wife just
[34:55] a few weeks ago brother Samuel that I
[34:58] had a dream I said you know I had a
[34:59] dream of me in you and I said honestly
[35:01] we were young you were young and I was
[35:04] young and we were beside each one
[35:06] another and you know it's going to be
[35:08] wonderful hallelujah
[35:09] and I was thinking of brother Branham
[35:11] and sister Mary that day he said is that
[35:13] you honey
[35:13] as a young sister meda a young brother
[35:17] branham and then when the vision went
[35:19] and you know and the tears were running
[35:21] down his eyes and praise God when he
[35:22] when he looked down and got it all dried
[35:25] up all the snow was gone and
[35:27] the leads were there Amen what a
[35:29] wonderful day that was praise God
[35:32] so Amen we are we're certainly noble to
[35:35] spoken word creation to do amen ix
[35:38] prison ORD and i and his great creation
[35:41] God saw everything that it was good amen
[35:47] it was very good it was very good
[35:49] because the eternal being is essentially
[35:53] good our God
[35:55] I don't know but Muslims or Allah well I
[35:59] was look I was not even in the em all it
[36:01] means God as all it means so he's a God
[36:04] with no name all right but our God's got
[36:07] a name the Lord Jesus Christ and our God
[36:10] hallelujah not only not there
[36:13] Amen but our God is a good God he's not
[36:16] going to bite murdering people and
[36:18] liquid hitting people and all out he's a
[36:20] good God and so thank the Lord for that
[36:23] his nuts in his personality and his
[36:26] Nitzer he's essentially good and
[36:28] goodness and it's per side and
[36:30] personified in Jesus Christ our Lord
[36:33] when what did he do he went about doing
[36:36] good and all he got for the reward from
[36:39] the world from the Pharisees and the
[36:41] Romans was crucified harvest my I'll
[36:44] tell you what you and I would look them
[36:45] Hance to be laid on us I tell you all
[36:48] your troubles will be gone if he would
[36:49] put them just a touch from the near
[36:51] print hands my that would really be a
[36:54] blessing to your heart today amen so
[36:56] praise the Lord
[36:57] undone may I just say this that that
[37:00] were good as a good a good word it's a
[37:01] joining word unobjective as they call it
[37:04] and then it's a joining where that's
[37:06] where objective means it's a joining
[37:08] word and it means pleasant acceptable
[37:11] and satisfactory so what him in the
[37:13] world it was pleasant amen and it was
[37:16] acceptable and it was satisfactory to
[37:19] him God always refers to anything that
[37:22] is desirable or beneficial as opposed to
[37:25] something bad unhurt fall amen
[37:28] oh what a wonderful thing to know that
[37:30] the Bible says the goodness of God leads
[37:32] men to repentance even so creation was
[37:36] very good what he admit so to start off
[37:38] with amen
[37:40] the eternal God had the invisible things
[37:43] amen and just because we don't see
[37:46] things with our human I don't mean they
[37:48] don't exist
[37:49] prison just shows our limitations Amen
[37:51] you see and and you know like I see them
[37:54] invisible atoms they have to recreate it
[37:56] to show something and and we know that
[37:59] the fourth dimension amen
[38:01] Victor's and not we have dimension
[38:03] things travel as a real dimension so
[38:06] praise the Lord
[38:07] Paul declares here the invisible things
[38:09] are clearly seen the Greek word is a
[38:12] cough or Oh Raoul clearly seen means
[38:15] thoroughly seen amen thoroughly
[38:18] perceived clearly amen to understand
[38:21] them so thank God we're not living in a
[38:24] mist you know we can see it clearly see
[38:27] the things that God has done in this day
[38:29] and he has done them and we know it a
[38:32] hostile image him hallelujah and so we
[38:34] perceive them and understand them
[38:36] because of the form they take no
[38:39] although they are created of nothing
[38:41] prison Lord the things that are made or
[38:44] crivit the creation the invisible
[38:47] heavens clearly declares the glory of
[38:51] God amen it was the first Bible
[38:54] let me speak about in a moment and the
[38:57] first feminum and dot dot dad that
[39:01] firmament there's a greek word for it
[39:03] not even going to try and pronounce it
[39:04] it's an extended service solid expanse
[39:07] called the vault was called the vault of
[39:09] heaven and took the water and it was
[39:12] only above the clouds and it was only
[39:14] when nor day were not was emptied on to
[39:18] the earth amen
[39:19] and and then as with the rain came from
[39:21] and then of course the flood and then
[39:23] the earth tilting and whatever not but
[39:26] prison Lord the firmament well air the
[39:29] firmament from here raid up your own
[39:31] night avarice is getting very thin hard
[39:34] to bury but you're still just about
[39:36] there amen and then of course nobody
[39:39] looked about 30 years ago he was talking
[39:41] about an ozone layer nobody knew him
[39:43] whose only hair was but we know know
[39:45] amen
[39:46] you keep out of the you know you key
[39:49] part of the the Sun praise the Lord
[39:52] and that so that ozone
[39:53] there to shield the Rays of the Sun
[39:56] against us
[39:57] and what a wonderful God that he made
[39:59] this planet habitable Amy and he really
[40:02] didn't do that and that's all for our
[40:04] good it's all for our safety hallelujah
[40:07] and he's thought of everything
[40:08] amen and so prison Lord wonderfully
[40:11] created you know fearfully and
[40:13] wonderfully made amen to show forth his
[40:16] workmanship and his handiwork
[40:18] amen and what a handy work it is prison
[40:21] Lord the voice their voice the heavens
[40:24] have got a voice amen
[40:25] the starry heavens and it's clear to all
[40:28] mankind that the grid I am the designer
[40:31] and builder is God amen as I said
[40:34] probably here before but I remember when
[40:37] Neil Armstrong was over in Ireland and
[40:39] he was being interviewed on the radio
[40:41] and I listened to it not at that time
[40:44] and what happened was the ER it was kind
[40:48] of personal questions and answers and uh
[40:50] the presenter asked him he said do you
[40:54] mind if I asked you seen were here do
[40:57] you believe in God you could just er
[40:59] know and he said yes and he said I know
[41:03] I'm getting personal but could you tell
[41:05] me why just shortly briefly you know and
[41:08] he said well yes I could and he said
[41:10] because when I was up there and looked
[41:12] at that universe looked at that story
[41:14] haven't looked at all the creation he
[41:16] said I saw a design a design no you
[41:20] can't hover the sang with her the
[41:21] designer you can't you just kind of do
[41:24] it amen
[41:25] well not only him can see a design we
[41:27] can see a design hallelujah so this is
[41:30] the designer amen honest wonderful
[41:32] prison Lord and the grid I am the
[41:35] designer Amen the Builder is God Christ
[41:37] Himself that created it all amen you
[41:40] know the again good on to the pro
[41:42] Catholics but you know while when we
[41:44] were being brought up the Catholics
[41:45] would tell us oh when Jesus was a baby
[41:47] he would take the clay and get it wet
[41:49] and make a little bird and he'd say
[41:51] what's this and throw it up in the air
[41:52] fly away they did they probably still
[41:56] believe that some of them but you know
[41:58] the Bible says his first miracle was in
[42:00] Cana of Galilee so he wasn't showing off
[42:03] the kids all look what I can do and you
[42:05] put a kid's come ain't got nothing no no
[42:07] that's not the way God works where is
[42:08] the Lord so here it was the whole
[42:10] universe in creation and Paul tells us
[42:13] it shows forth as eternal Godhead has
[42:16] eternal and everlasting made and
[42:18] strengthened ability that he's got to do
[42:20] it on his inherent power that resides in
[42:23] him the eternal Godhead prison Lord and
[42:26] the divine nature by virtue of which he
[42:30] speaks it and it happens hallelujah amen
[42:34] and bless the Lord we just want to say
[42:38] something in a moment about that amen
[42:40] but the heavens were his first Bible I
[42:44] was Jewish first Bible the zodiac amen
[42:47] brother Branham and I might just run
[42:49] this past year brother Branham and the
[42:51] 60s but 62 he talked about the cross
[42:54] face that's where we are now he said
[42:56] Amen put in 62 he said that Malachi 4
[43:01] hadn't been brought into existence yet
[43:04] it wasn't there
[43:05] Amen we're looking for him he said you
[43:07] know but that was the common step into
[43:09] his office as a prophet amen and so I
[43:12] hear he was and he's talking about job
[43:15] and that's he said that's where we are
[43:17] and if you look at the ancient zodiac
[43:20] the real Babylonian one guru way back
[43:22] because the Romans like they always do
[43:24] and the Greeks they get all mixed up
[43:26] they've got swarms and all kinds of
[43:28] stuff in it it's got nothing to do the
[43:30] original zodiac and so the original
[43:32] where you have there you have the Virgin
[43:35] and then the Leo the Lion at the end and
[43:38] then between you got them cross fish and
[43:40] if you look at one am cross fish amen
[43:43] it's sad it's joined to this other fish
[43:46] that's horizontal amen so you can see
[43:48] one of the faces going up a woman has to
[43:50] say behind you know and really what it
[43:53] was as the bridegroom open its Israel
[43:55] Brazil or join together like those time
[43:57] because that said Naomi and Ruth
[43:59] whatever way you want to look at it
[44:00] that's where we are pretty large and 62
[44:03] that's what was coming forth amen and
[44:06] it's still coming forth were cells and
[44:08] joined by God praise the Lord
[44:10] but you know and 63 if you come into it
[44:14] and you know I remember I wouldn't say
[44:17] there's anybody able to help I ha ha
[44:19] nobody janitor you have you in your neck
[44:21] I want to you again No
[44:23] praise the Lord the heavy is used to say
[44:25] this is the dawning of the Age of
[44:27] Aquarius almost smoke more dope and
[44:29] we'll be happy you know more and more
[44:31] what anymore oh my but they must sit a
[44:34] million miles but I'll tell you what
[44:37] they hadn't something they knew there
[44:39] was something common something common
[44:42] and if you look at Aquarius the sign of
[44:45] Aquarius and how you know it's a lovely
[44:48] study how do you know what it really is
[44:50] all the stars have been named the way
[44:52] back then and they'll tell you they'll
[44:55] tell you like even in Virgo the virgin
[44:57] she has a a bunch of wheat weed in her
[45:02] hand and just something like a branch so
[45:04] also you know and she's horizontal in
[45:06] other words the heavens are telling us
[45:08] don't worship the Virgin amen
[45:11] but here's the bronze in her hands
[45:12] here's the weed in her hands and except
[45:15] a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[45:16] die she was going to bring him forth
[45:18] amen and that so so here when you come
[45:22] to Aquarius what have you find you find
[45:25] this person and he's got like a big
[45:27] water jug and he's pouring out the water
[45:30] the water of the word hallelujah poured
[45:33] all over the bread of Jesus Christ all
[45:35] around the world you know and that's the
[45:37] age we're and what it's a new age a new
[45:39] message and it's wonderful
[45:41] hallelujah okay let's let's go on amen
[45:43] so prison Lord brother bronze says look
[45:47] at the earth spinning around and perfect
[45:49] harmony amen perfect harmony
[45:52] order an order as never by chance this
[45:55] word could not spin the way it has done
[45:57] for all these thousands of years and
[45:59] everything stayed the way it has would
[46:02] take somebody order and not to happen it
[46:05] just said so order has to happen amen
[46:08] praise the Lord and the earth is better
[46:11] tamed than a nice wit's watch that you
[46:13] could find pretty Lord like I said this
[46:15] morning with the engine it's perfect
[46:17] it never loses its beat now sometimes
[46:20] they do say it does wobble and do things
[46:22] they got but you know my my it still
[46:24] goes on it still goes on praise the Lord
[46:26] so remember hallelujah amen
[46:30] he says can you bind the sweet influence
[46:33] of
[46:33] Trinity's that's or lose the parts of
[46:36] Orion and plenties is the Seven Stars
[46:38] taping the seven the seven stars in 100
[46:42] Jesus or seven churches messengers and
[46:45] to the seven churches and the sweet
[46:48] influence of Pleiades
[46:49] what a sweet influence they have had on
[46:52] us Amy and then their messengers
[46:54] you know I was just telling we had maybe
[46:56] you don't know it but on the 31st of
[46:58] October this year on 15th of 1517 1517
[47:05] we find that Martin Luther took his
[47:08] little pieces and in the inlet to the
[47:11] door of Wittenberg Castle that he wanted
[47:14] the church did a bit what was going on
[47:17] and said it and the wrong things that
[47:18] were going on and get them sorted eyed
[47:20] but instead of not happening in an order
[47:23] that he wanted what happened was they
[47:26] took a bridge whose s a priest there
[47:28] from there trying to tell us that we
[47:31] read of order you know and that we
[47:32] should be it anything he says well he
[47:34] didn't mean it but I'll tell you what he
[47:35] started the Reformation amen because
[47:38] that had to come out of there you know
[47:39] and Prince the Lord it sure did know the
[47:43] restoration of the braintree and he did
[47:45] and so you can think about that I'll be
[47:46] in Germany in September praise the Lord
[47:49] I'm looking forward on being Switzerland
[47:50] France and Germany and that's all a
[47:53] story that I haven't got time to tell

[48:05] bond goddess job can you open or loose
[48:08] the bonds of Orion the cords this Orion
[48:11] is the beautiful Christ but you know
[48:13] something a way back if you studied and
[48:16] ah what was it not the Earth's early
[48:19] stage but head slaps to bubbles you read
[48:23] all of it it's a hard read but you read
[48:25] all about Nimrod and you know something
[48:27] lo and behold they say Nimrod that's him
[48:31] the bonds of a riot say even if you
[48:33] looked at the Great Pyramid and then
[48:36] pyramids they're all the exact copy of
[48:39] the belt of Orion and so they say oh
[48:42] that's numb rod but I'll tell you we say
[48:45] that Jesus Christ hallelujah
[48:47] hallelujah that's what we say the
[48:48] mystery of God reveals hallelujah and so
[48:52] because the pyramid was the second Bible
[48:54] and Amen a job I could not I cannot
[48:58] understand the mischief at all but
[49:00] hallelujah we can and do understand the
[49:02] mystery hard that he Christ
[49:04] Orion let the glory of heaven and came
[49:07] here on this earth and his cords were
[49:09] loosed amen and revelation can praise
[49:12] the Lord they certainly were amen
[49:14] the coming of the Son of Man with that
[49:16] revelation of them seven seals amen
[49:18] praise the Lord so no wonder don't
[49:20] wonder a little fella way over in
[49:22] Austria somewhere Amen could write the
[49:25] words Oh Lord my God when I in awesome
[49:28] wonder consider all your hands of men I
[49:31] see the stars I hear the Rolling Thunder
[49:33] thy hand to light the universe to spread

[49:40] How Great Thou art How Great Thou art
[49:43] then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
[49:47] How Great Thou art why because it was
[49:51] invisible but it was in his mind he
[49:54] spoke at he career he made earth for us
[49:57] hallelujah to the minutest detail praise
[50:00] God amen
[50:02] and he's a great God not ever made
[50:04] because I could watch the time look
[50:06] anything and I'm going to use this here
[50:08] over here keep your are not solid there
[50:09] Justin and a little while but three
[50:12] things that Paul says there he says
[50:15] first of all the invisible things are
[50:17] clearly seen that means them be made
[50:19] visible a scene of him from the creation
[50:22] okay then he said by these things that
[50:26] are made we apply these things that are
[50:28] seen we understand what is made so if
[50:32] you'd walk round that yard was with
[50:35] Michelangelo and you see nothing there
[50:37] but he sees something he sees a big slab
[50:40] of marble and he walks throwing it in
[50:43] your finger oh I don't see nothing here
[50:45] and he's walking round up and he sees
[50:48] Moses and not say it's invisible to you
[50:51] but it's not invisible to him it's in
[50:53] his mind and he takes that down
[50:55] apparently they had rejected that bit of
[50:57] marble well that's a masterpiece
[51:00] some masterpiece amen so when it's
[51:03] million you understand what was in his
[51:05] mind
[51:06] praise the Lord and then what do they do
[51:08] in this text they show forth God's
[51:11] eternal power on his Godhead 9 so I'm
[51:14] just going to speak about one other
[51:16] thing that was invisible amen
[51:18] I just rate at this moment and as mine
[51:21] the crown of God's creation amen a psalm
[51:24] 139 just very briefly he said I will
[51:27] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[51:29] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[51:32] and my soul Lord right well my substance
[51:35] was not hid from you Amen when I was
[51:38] made in secret hallelujah you know
[51:41] you're a designer product in fact you
[51:44] are how do you you know I talk about
[51:47] little things that I've done and when I
[51:49] went over there to the Philippines three
[51:52] little things I'll tell you but now you
[51:53] know I certain but how well you know
[51:55] first of all two pastors and brother
[51:58] James he said brother George I'll be
[52:01] your bodyguard everywhere because don't
[52:03] know there are Muslims you know
[52:04] and the concern for me down there that
[52:07] everything would be all right but it was
[52:08] okay and so you know I I said brother
[52:12] James I've got something for you you
[52:15] showed me your letter Church and there
[52:16] he was working away trying to plaster
[52:17] and I said you told me that you didn't
[52:20] have any doors and the windows and I
[52:22] said there's a couple of hundred dollars
[52:24] that will help you to go on so I came
[52:26] here to the bathroom and he's taking
[52:28] photographs and and I said Jim what are
[52:31] you doing he said I'm taking photographs
[52:33] of this money Jackie for why did he he
[52:37] said I've never seen a hundred dollar
[52:40] bill in my life a man never seen it
[52:43] folks can you imagine her but later off
[52:44] but thank God I know he was done
[52:46] something with that then his brother
[52:48] he's a pastor at another part of the
[52:49] island and I said to brother mark I said
[52:53] mark I've got something for you and I
[52:56] know it affects you because you're small
[52:58] these people you know and I said this is
[53:01] a Levi's shirt now can you imagine
[53:03] Nona mean like here's a Levi's certain
[53:06] I'm giving to and he broke down in tears
[53:08] and I said did I say something no Dada
[53:12] what you know what
[53:13] olessa bite and a breath you know
[53:17] are you okay yeah and what's wrong
[53:22] he said I've always wanted a Levi's
[53:24] shirt he said he said but I could never
[53:31] afford one and I said what brother this
[53:35] is for me
[53:36] and you don't have to pay for it this is
[53:39] my gift to you
[53:40] and that's why he was crammed you know
[53:42] wonderful things and so praise the Lord
[53:45] here we are we're meet in secret amen my
[53:48] substance was not hid from me I was near
[53:50] and sigrid curiously wrought in the
[53:52] lowest parts of the earth amen
[53:54] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[53:56] being unperfect but in my book all my
[53:59] members were written God's got a book
[54:02] he's got a number of books but you know
[54:04] he's got a book and all your man all
[54:06] your members were written you know like
[54:08] I was preaching all up
[54:09] I could even preach it this afternoon
[54:10] you know ah the body is full of light
[54:13] and you know where it says and I think
[54:16] it's Luke 11 where Jesus said that of
[54:18] your eye a single amen your body will be
[54:21] full of light and heart I kind of go on
[54:23] did folks but you know how your body has
[54:25] got 4s and when you go after 65 you're

[54:33] are 91 and whatever not they're still on
[54:35] their last ray so you know it doesn't
[54:37] actually tell you when it's going to
[54:39] happen but before goals any program
[54:41] talks about acts rational just don't do
[54:44] as many if you can help it at all
[54:46] because you will lose your cosmic like
[54:48] amen and so anyway
[54:50] praise the Lord but I won't get on to
[54:52] that there but you know what we were
[54:54] talking about the eye we're talking here
[54:56] but our members made your eyes are
[54:59] absolutely wonderful amen do you know
[55:02] why did God give you two ice you know
[55:04] wisely not give you three eyes or one

[55:22] you're looking in 3d you're not looking
[55:24] at a flat surface they God you're
[55:26] looking
[55:27] because you got to ice prince & you know
[55:30] the story of the I you know even even
[55:33] Charles Darwin admitted that he can't
[55:35] explain the human eye because he knew
[55:38] that it can't evolve you know you don't
[55:41] start off with a bunch of something and
[55:43] it evolves to this and involves that you
[55:45] had to have all the components to put it
[55:48] together and make an eye and he knew
[55:51] that and it's true praise the Lord and
[55:53] not I abut single if it's focused
[55:55] hallelujah it's the light of your body
[55:57] how much more spiritually even I focused
[56:01] on to the Lord will it be the light of
[56:03] your body
[56:04] amen but you see these were all and
[56:07] continuance were fashioned when I said
[56:10] there was none of them so they were
[56:12] invisible only God in his mind you but
[56:15] you Amen there was no mind probably
[56:18] wasn't even a spirit man man I don't
[56:20] know but what I do know it was invisible
[56:23] but the invisible became visible all
[56:26] that it you know that's why he did you
[56:29] know you say I've got five let's say
[56:31] five fingers you got a pregnant finger
[56:33] and what four fingers that um I knew

[57:06] wonderfully made
[57:07] hallelujah card presses are thy thoughts
[57:11] to me oh god her grit is the sum of them
[57:14] that he would make us and make us body
[57:16] soul and spirit amen
[57:18] okay so that's mine no I if I could talk
[57:21] about this little fella for a moment
[57:23] because uh you know it would be
[57:25] impossible to bring to all the
[57:27] tabernacle today you couldn't get what
[57:29] I'm sure you've studied it over the
[57:30] years amen and our tax enrollments amen
[57:34] the invisible things are clearly seen of
[57:36] him from the creation all right this
[57:38] structure was clearly
[57:40] in God's mind hallelujah Edwards in his
[57:43] mind first and foremost from the
[57:45] beginning when Moses delivered the
[57:47] people from Egypt you know in the
[57:49] wilderness if you oughta said our before
[57:51] but crossing the Red Sea when I leave in
[57:53] Egypt have you had a said Moses when he
[57:56] shows the design for the tabernacle able
[57:58] to said what tabernacle oh and what
[58:00] about the tabernacle why don't wanna
[58:02] back up you say brother George no
[58:04] absolutely mad how hard would he known
[58:07] about the tabernacle until he got them
[58:09] in Sinai and went up that mountain at
[58:10] God's command see and so that's what it
[58:13] was but it was first and foremost it had
[58:15] to be revealed and what a revelation it
[58:18] was and Moses access 24 went into the
[58:21] midst of the cloud and got himself up
[58:23] the mind and Moses was in the mind 40
[58:25] days 40 nights and the Lord speak on the
[58:27] Moses saying speak to the children of
[58:30] Israel that they may bring an offering
[58:31] of every man had given it one Lee with
[58:33] his heart he shall make me an offering
[58:35] him in and let them go me a century that
[58:39] I may dwell in enormous that was the
[58:41] whole idea of the tabernacle a century
[58:44] that God could dwell with his people
[58:47] Amen I love that hallelujah and and says
[58:50] and according to all that I show you
[58:53] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[58:56] the pattern of all the instruments thou
[58:58] shall make it precisely every detail so
[59:02] coming out of Egypt it's an invisible
[59:03] thing to Moses knows nothing about it no
[59:06] it's going to become visible it's going
[59:09] to become visible hallelujah and praise
[59:10] the Lord we get a leaven thing here it
[59:15] was invisible to Moses but in the mind
[59:16] of God
[59:17] it became visible he saw it hallelujah
[59:20] and he understood the invisible by the
[59:23] things that were made
[59:24] Moses saw it Moses saw for the first
[59:26] time God's divine blueprint amen of the
[59:29] place of his worship and the police
[59:32] where he would place his name remember
[59:34] the only place and in Isaiah 6 that we
[59:38] already quoted what happened he said
[59:40] where he was and that place the glory of
[59:43] God the angel flew off the servant flew
[59:47] off and took coals from off the altar
[59:49] there had to be an altar there with
[59:52] coals on it and
[59:53] didn't burners noise but they were there
[59:56] see so Moses saw it every detail God
[1:00:00] give him it in blueprint and he made it
[1:00:02] exactly like it was and I mentioned the
[1:00:04] serpents the Serpent's earlier on to you
[1:00:07] amen and so this was that the blueprint
[1:00:10] but what was the key what was there that
[1:00:14] this Ark of the Covenant
[1:00:15] now this little fella here that's a
[1:00:17] lovely little model you thought of that
[1:00:20] and dad it was three quarters three and
[1:00:23] three quarters feet long that's all TNT
[1:00:26] quarter feet long that's all it was it
[1:00:28] was a a two and a half feet high and two
[1:00:32] and a quarter feet wide that's all boy
[1:00:37] you think God's going to do a big temple
[1:00:39] or something like that and here's a
[1:00:41] little box amen
[1:00:43] and what's going to be on that box
[1:00:46] praise the Lord amen you see the
[1:00:49] contents Bourbon samuel showed me this
[1:00:52] morning the pot of manna symbolizing the
[1:00:55] true bread that came down from heaven

[1:00:57] that does not feed away or decay it's
[1:01:00] incorruptible prison Lord and I was in
[1:01:03] the store with my wife and we saw let us

[1:01:08] kitchen I don't see it made from akhiya
[1:01:10] wood I'm what a beautiful print and they
[1:01:14] call it incorruptible wood and no doubt
[1:01:17] that's just because he was incorruptible
[1:01:20] that you'll not be less than more than
[1:01:23] 72 hours and agree of because amen you
[1:01:26] will not see corruption I'm not a care
[1:01:28] which speaks of Jesus Christ and so and
[1:01:31] there the ten stones are the two stones
[1:01:34] of the commandments the ten commandments
[1:01:36] and I'll speak a bit that a little bit
[1:01:38] later in it the 10 and then Aaron's rod
[1:01:41] the dead stick and came back to life you
[1:01:43] see on board fruit tapping the
[1:01:45] resurrection of Jesus Christ

[1:01:50] the newness of a body that can never see
[1:01:52] death again praise the Lord but that
[1:01:55] tabernacle folks he got a
[1:01:56] homonymous you gotta focus on us you see
[1:01:59] the chief piece of furniture and dot Ark
[1:02:04] and that whole Tabernacle was this fella
[1:02:07] here
[1:02:08] that was the chief everything else was
[1:02:11] secondary beautiful but secondary all
[1:02:14] nevertheless and amen the chief piece of
[1:02:19] that art was the was of the Covenant was
[1:02:21] the mercy seat right on that there's not
[1:02:23] the things that were in it but right
[1:02:25] where your angels are touching wings
[1:02:26] right below that on the lid was the
[1:02:29] mercy seat praise God for that mercy
[1:02:32] seat amen and when you look at the whole
[1:02:35] structure it was invisible but now it
[1:02:38] was become invisible see that's the
[1:02:41] whole point that I want to get over to
[1:02:42] you today it was invisible but not
[1:02:44] compensable hallelujah and so amen
[1:02:48] everything leaded in perfect order and
[1:02:50] explained it's a complete type of Christ
[1:02:53] from the door to the mercy seat it shows
[1:02:56] his eternal power and Godhead and not
[1:02:59] here he meets God this is God meets man
[1:03:04] on God's conditions and God's
[1:03:07] requirements amen under fall or mine
[1:03:11] amen under necessity of a life for a
[1:03:15] life a blood sacrifice amen
[1:03:18] are clearly shown throughout it when you
[1:03:20] have your arm you know your Passover
[1:03:23] lamb sacrificed and he takes in the
[1:03:25] blood and he sprinkles it here over over
[1:03:28] on the mercy seat right here amen and
[1:03:30] God would accept the blood of that lamb
[1:03:32] praise the Lord
[1:03:34] no okay so amen he said the plas over
[1:03:38] blood was to take into the Holy of
[1:03:39] Holies sprinkled on the mercy seat for
[1:03:41] the people man comes in to God by the
[1:03:44] door which is Christ the sacrificial
[1:03:46] lamb of God amen and as a sin offering
[1:03:49] for atonement for sin cleanse him from
[1:03:52] sin everything his blood shed for the
[1:03:54] sins of his people the high priest
[1:03:55] carries that lambs blood in a sensor on
[1:03:57] the day of atonement and the blood is
[1:03:59] sprinkled seven times for each search he
[1:04:01] ate amen so I'm glad we've got the blood
[1:04:04] today because when I see the Blood I
[1:04:05] will pass over you and then the lovely
[1:04:09] thing is because it's pure gold
[1:04:10] this mercy seat amen the lovely thing
[1:04:14] about it is that amen on that mercy seat
[1:04:18] s where God will
[1:04:21] his people all happens right there and
[1:04:25] that's where we have a mercy seat today
[1:04:26] your heart everything a mercy seat amen
[1:04:29] and brother Branham said and right over
[1:04:32] that folks that's what you can't see
[1:04:34] today but I'll tell you there was a
[1:04:36] lovely soft glow of late just hungover
[1:04:38] up between their measles and brother
[1:04:40] Brennan said that was the Shekinah glory
[1:04:43] of Almighty God and that is why I say I
[1:04:47] would say to that if you had have been a
[1:04:49] Buddha when trading along in your camel
[1:04:51] and you looked that you'd say court was
[1:04:54] but seven feet high okay
[1:04:57] but this better bit bit bigger or
[1:04:59] smaller than his circling here right in
[1:05:00] here and you know a Buddha when driving
[1:05:02] along looks over and he sees a bit of a
[1:05:04] tent said what saw a lot of bird in
[1:05:06] there well I don't know nothing about
[1:05:08] I'd keep driving this camel you know but
[1:05:10] in there was the Shekinah glory of God
[1:05:13] that he could dwell with his people
[1:05:16] amen and that's what it was all about
[1:05:18] hallelujah that's what they had amen
[1:05:21] and I could go into more but that's what
[1:05:23] they had prison orde that's why this
[1:05:25] piece of furniture the mercy seat is
[1:05:27] mentioned is so important with third it
[1:05:30] the whole structure would be minimus but
[1:05:32] that God was there amen that God was
[1:05:35] there the wings touching supreme
[1:05:37] holiness unto the lord supreme holiness
[1:05:40] unto the lord amen and that lovely
[1:05:43] weight soft glow light the Shekinah
[1:05:46] glory of Almighty God and a form a man
[1:05:49] prison Ord and that is where God meets
[1:05:53] mine and mine meets God praise the Lord
[1:05:57] so we understand eternal mind and
[1:05:59] intelligence by the things that are me
[1:06:02] at all of it I'm not going to say any
[1:06:03] more about it
[1:06:04] because they're at what's invisible now
[1:06:06] it becomes visible and I'm sure your
[1:06:08] postures could given but a weird I took
[1:06:10] you were what all the meanings of the
[1:06:12] different things are but we see that it
[1:06:15] shows his eternal Godhead as eternal go
[1:06:17] ahead knowing one other thing that was
[1:06:19] amen and it was a high priest and the
[1:06:22] tabernacle but it's not a high priest
[1:06:24] mention in the temple it's a king
[1:06:27] hallelujah and so I'll mention in a
[1:06:30] minute just keep your eye on out there
[1:06:31] but in second chronicles three and one
[1:06:33] then solomon the
[1:06:35] to build the house of the Lord Jerusalem
[1:06:37] on my Moriah where the Lord appeared on
[1:06:39] the David his father in the peace that
[1:06:40] giveth had prepared in the threshing
[1:06:42] floor of Ornan the Jebusite and this was
[1:06:46] always in the eternal thoughts of God
[1:06:48] amen even when it was a little
[1:06:50] Tabernacle be amid God already knew that
[1:06:53] there was going to be a temple amen see
[1:06:55] because he's God and it was invisible to
[1:06:57] the people they had the on their
[1:06:59] wanderings they had this tabernacle but
[1:07:01] in God's mind he wanted a permanent
[1:07:04] building prison Ord and that was given
[1:07:07] to David amen who moved by the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost to build such a building and he
[1:07:12] said I dwell in a house here and God's
[1:07:14] will in a tent and he had this the Holy
[1:07:16] Spirit to say I'm going to build a
[1:07:19] building for God a temple where he can
[1:07:21] dwell them and of course you know
[1:07:23] because of Bathsheba because of Uriah
[1:07:26] and other things see but he said you've
[1:07:28] got blood on your hands he said you
[1:07:30] can't hold it for me your son Solomon
[1:07:32] amount of peace he will build it but
[1:07:35] David did everything he bought the
[1:07:38] kneels he put the cold in the silver and
[1:07:40] he did everything and he laid it all on
[1:07:43] to Solomon and actually I believe of
[1:07:45] them correct that he actually drew the
[1:07:47] design of the tabernacle while he was
[1:07:49] not in a transport something similar to
[1:07:51] Liggett and he drew died and not Bush
[1:07:54] built it was a permanent stature the
[1:07:57] house of the Lord the place where God
[1:07:59] placed his name and that's where we are
[1:08:02] he's presses me - amen and he said for
[1:08:06] now I have chosen and sanctified this
[1:08:08] house that my name may be there forever
[1:08:10] and mine eyes mine heart shall be there
[1:08:14] perpetually and the grip feasts of the
[1:08:17] Lord were held there as well I just say
[1:08:20] it was a permanent structure because
[1:08:22] when they took this organ do you see
[1:08:24] these rods that day that they were taken
[1:08:27] out in the temple amen
[1:08:29] because it was permanent no more moving
[1:08:31] well isn't it wonderful I know one of
[1:08:33] the things but one day hallelujah you'll

[1:12:22] place where you've sat your name please
[1:12:24] come down an answered their prayer and
[1:12:26] you know he was a good receptive in the
[1:12:28] god Jonah a man Jonah he prayed he
[1:12:32] turned toward Jerusalem you say brother
[1:12:34] George hardly to do that even the world
[1:12:37] bellies of the wheel hardly know what
[1:12:40] he's praying to Jerusalem it's very very
[1:12:42] simple if you start off here and
[1:12:44] tournament three hundred and eighty
[1:12:46] degrees circle and keep praying you'll
[1:12:48] be pointed in jerusalem somewhere a man
[1:12:52] and he said and God heard that prayer of
[1:12:55] Jonah hallelujah amen
[1:12:57] but you know something and here was the
[1:13:00] here was the visible invisible made
[1:13:03] visible and you know the Jewish thought
[1:13:05] this is a perpetual Monument hallelujah
[1:13:08] but Jesus told them he said you've made
[1:13:11] the temple your God and the temple is
[1:13:13] not your God
[1:13:15] tumblers were gored Wells the Shekinah
[1:13:17] glory the Jews couldn't accept that and
[1:13:20] believe that amen even when he warned
[1:13:22] them and warned them and then the day
[1:13:24] came where it says akka board over the
[1:13:28] heights the glory of the Lord has
[1:13:31] departed
[1:13:32] oh mama my my so prison Lord okay so I
[1:13:36] tell you what that's a sad day we never
[1:13:39] want that Amen that could happen if the
[1:13:42] Apostle Paul could say that he wants to
[1:13:44] press on and finish the course that I
[1:13:47] don't become a castaway amen how much
[1:13:50] more menu that I don't want to become a
[1:13:52] castaway I think we heard it already
[1:13:53] that we want to finish the race we want
[1:13:56] to finish it and be there amen
[1:13:58] okay no let me just go on very very
[1:14:01] quickly Christ Himself the mystery of
[1:14:03] God revealed
[1:14:04] you know nobody knew about that my when
[1:14:06] that was happening all up in the heavens
[1:14:08] you know there it was leaving millions
[1:14:11] we won't even meet but we were in God's
[1:14:14] mind and you know that's what he did he
[1:14:17] desired to have a form he knew what he
[1:14:19] was going to make gonna create and the
[1:14:22] formerly took that theophany body was
[1:14:25] Christ the logos hallelujah and just to
[1:14:28] keep it simple amen dot logos became
[1:14:31] flesh and dwelt among us amen and aren't
[1:14:35] you glad that that happened because the
[1:14:37] Bible says God's invisible as I read and
[1:14:39] Jesus said God as a spirit you must
[1:14:41] worship Him in spirit you know you can
[1:14:44] sing a song but if it doesn't come from
[1:14:45] your heart no good
[1:14:47] amen it's no good praise the Lord so
[1:14:49] there we are and you know God and not
[1:14:52] glory of that theophany amen you know
[1:14:55] Ezekiel sinem fire ferry being read down
[1:14:59] and up given has been and Daniel saw his
[1:15:02] glory and John saw his glory and as I
[1:15:06] saw as glory said I saw the Lord what
[1:15:09] did he see him not through not day what
[1:15:11] did he see him in but he saw the Lord
[1:15:13] hallelujah praise God what he was in
[1:15:16] human form anon I do not know but I tell
[1:15:19] you what he saw the Lord Amen and he saw
[1:15:21] his glory amen
[1:15:22] so praise the Lord as a son a kinsman
[1:15:25] redeemer
[1:15:26] in the form of the sovereign servant he
[1:15:28] came
[1:15:29] why because God wanted to reveal himself
[1:15:31] amen and the place where he said his
[1:15:34] name like the temple and here is saddest
[1:15:36] neum and Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:38] a greater than Solomon here amen and so
[1:15:41] the eternal mind and thought of God the
[1:15:44] invisible one took form
[1:15:46] thank God he took form and eventually
[1:15:48] born into the world that you could touch
[1:15:51] him and handle him the Word of Life
[1:15:53] associate to me I'm sure disputed amen
[1:15:56] so we know that the invisible was made
[1:15:59] it became visible by the things that we
[1:16:02] say and John said we did touch him and
[1:16:04] we handle him the word of life amen
[1:16:07] praise God said also wonderful night and
[1:16:10] that you know he wanted to do that he
[1:16:13] wanted to reveal the true God and that's
[1:16:15] why he came by the Incarnation he could
[1:16:17] see himself in the Bible because he said
[1:16:19] to the Jews
[1:16:20] he said I'm a book my father's business
[1:16:22] okay so god bless you all and finish up
[1:16:25] 9 the next 10 minutes and if I can I
[1:16:27] said well I'm a bit amen
[1:16:29] and that he made her preeminence in his
[1:16:32] church his body his bride and that he
[1:16:34] might restore the kingdom to its
[1:16:36] rightful place so the king invisible me
[1:16:39] invisible the king of kings and the Lord
[1:16:42] of lords and I am just coming up to I
[1:16:45] could say more or not but I just for
[1:16:46] times sake
[1:16:47] I will not but hallelujah that's look at
[1:16:50] us today just as we close up this
[1:16:52] section of the service Amen see nobody
[1:16:55] really knew bitter bright I mean you go
[1:16:57] Park in any any of the original they
[1:17:00] really didn't know but a bride they talk
[1:17:01] about a church you know and a New
[1:17:04] Testament God always deals with a nation
[1:17:06] Israel amen but even in the Old
[1:17:09] Testament the shadow is there we've got
[1:17:12] Rebekah and Isaac and we've got David
[1:17:15] and is five hundred wives amen I'm not
[1:17:19] must have been a stray on them amen 500
[1:17:22] of them not 5 500 well I'll tell you
[1:17:25] what but praise God it was typology
[1:17:27] because he and says that Christ would
[1:17:31] have a many member braids hallelujah I'm
[1:17:35] not is so true and then of course
[1:17:37] Ruth and boys prison Lord what a lovely
[1:17:40] lovely type daughters they may
[1:17:43] Rutten boas and Naomi Israel and Ruth
[1:17:46] with Gentile praise God Mauri men and
[1:17:49] the kinsman redeemer you went through it
[1:17:51] all and you know it and I'm glad and I
[1:17:54] just feel the anointing of God right
[1:17:56] here and right now amen
[1:17:57] so prison Lord the reason for this is
[1:18:00] that the Bride of Christ was in the mind
[1:18:03] of God from eternity you came from that
[1:18:06] mind of God you are the predestinated
[1:18:09] seed when you believe this word amen and
[1:18:12] all you were waiting for in your life
[1:18:15] was God to show and through his word on
[1:18:18] that seed and like we all know it when
[1:18:21] it happened they find seeds in so many
[1:18:24] sparrows graves and what did they do
[1:18:26] they took some and planted them and what
[1:18:29] happened they grew imagine all four
[1:18:32] hundred years later amen and they grew
[1:18:35] or four thighs or whatever it is they
[1:18:37] grew praise the Lord
[1:18:39] so amen this Bride of Christ was just
[1:18:43] waiting for the word to be weaved over
[1:18:46] them as we said this morning and give
[1:18:48] you life amen and that's what has
[1:18:50] happened and the reason for this is
[1:18:53] because the Bride of Christ was on his
[1:18:55] mind from eternity you were in his
[1:18:57] eternal thoughts and folks really and
[1:19:00] truly Amen that limbs an eternal thing
[1:19:04] to the bride because being in that man's
[1:19:07] eternal that's why you know when you
[1:19:09] look at some of the old Nazarene you
[1:19:12] know you can be saved today and I know
[1:19:14] what the main you know John Wesley a
[1:19:16] drunk man met him one day and he said Oh
[1:19:19] mr. Wesley said I'm one of your converts
[1:19:21] he said I can see that I said you're not
[1:19:25] one of the Lord's you know it's so easy
[1:19:28] you know a person could do that but a
[1:19:30] real genuine seed when that word is
[1:19:33] weaved over them not my pets them amen
[1:19:36] they know who they are and you're not
[1:19:38] here today and tomorrow been Boxford and
[1:19:40] lost that will not happen praise God you
[1:19:43] will finish the course amen and so
[1:19:46] hallelujah because you were in eternal
[1:19:48] thoughts you were to help me you know as
[1:19:51] brother Branham said we don't often
[1:19:53] think about it but you know he just say
[1:19:54] it
[1:19:55] he said that God was alone with
[1:19:57] of thoughts God was alone with his
[1:19:59] thoughts
[1:20:00] you know and here was Adam and you know
[1:20:03] God turned around and he says it's not
[1:20:07] good that Adam should be alone but he
[1:20:10] was alone I said but it's not good
[1:20:13] tadhana was alone and he made out of his
[1:20:15] red he merely praise the Lord well I'll
[1:20:17] tell you what folks I've got good news
[1:20:20] he's not alone I because he's got his
[1:20:23] brain
[1:20:24] he's got his grave hallelujah hey man
[1:20:27] brother Donny amen
[1:20:28] he's got his bride and thank God he's
[1:20:30] not alone and where he goes he'll go
[1:20:32] where he said she'll sit praise God yes
[1:20:35] she absolutely will amen
[1:20:37] and you know that you know when did it
[1:20:40] come on praise the Lord the jury's never
[1:20:42] seen it coming but on the day of
[1:20:44] Pentecost a bride was born that church
[1:20:46] first churches was born amen
[1:20:48] and then in our day the bride for our
[1:20:51] day amen come forth this brother Branham
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:54] started to preach well you can say it
[1:20:57] whenever he just says about an Ohio
[1:21:00] River in 1933 you go back as far as you
[1:21:02] want when the purifier are formed but
[1:21:05] the whole thing then was a change of
[1:21:07] dispensation and it was going to end up
[1:21:09] what I call you bright that's who you
[1:21:12] are
[1:21:13] if you want your identification there it
[1:21:15] is you believe this you are bright amen
[1:21:19] so she materialized from being invisible
[1:21:22] before the day of Pentecost was just a
[1:21:24] handful of a handful of disciples amen
[1:21:27] and praise the Lord I I was heard
[1:21:31] someone a brother speaking I never
[1:21:33] December Samuel you know Jesus sent
[1:21:37] 70-minute
[1:21:38] and they saw the miracles they saw it
[1:21:40] all they come back rejoicing even the
[1:21:42] spirits are subject unto us and the
[1:21:46] brother was saying was that the same
[1:21:47] seven-day that when he said except to
[1:21:49] eat my blood my flesh and drink my blood
[1:21:51] and they said oh that's a hard scene I
[1:21:54] mean we saw American Sparky and Enola
[1:21:56] but that's a hard scene Jews don't drink
[1:21:58] blood you know and you see what I said
[1:22:01] this morning they were putting a carnal
[1:22:04] interpretation on a spiritual revelation
[1:22:07] you can't do it folks you got to get
[1:22:09] this first a revelation of
[1:22:10] amen so prison Ord amen and here she was
[1:22:14] made visible there's a pride today amen
[1:22:18] and you can clearly seen it wasn't
[1:22:20] visible in the mind of God you were
[1:22:22] there and now we're here on this earth
[1:22:24] as his bride amen and the invisible has
[1:22:29] been made visible we're here praise God
[1:22:32] and I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed or
[1:22:34] not I'm not ashamed of brother Branham
[1:22:36] Amen I'm not I'm not ashamed of the
[1:22:38] gospel I don't care
[1:22:40] people can laugh the whole way during
[1:22:41] the road and the donee voltaren I don't
[1:22:44] care amen I am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:22:46] we read it all right I'm not ashamed of
[1:22:49] the message and I'm certainly not
[1:22:51] ashamed of brother Branham never
[1:22:53] hallelujah never will be no I praise the
[1:22:55] Lord and so it's a masterpiece in every
[1:22:58] aspect amen praise the Lord that
[1:23:01] alacrity coming into plain view amen
[1:23:05] missus Jesus Christ voila
[1:23:08] you know not years that's a mouthful
[1:23:10] yeah mrs. Jesus Christ I think you
[1:23:13] really think you are yes for this praise

[1:23:17] amen that's what this word has done for
[1:23:19] us amen he showed us here we are the
[1:23:22] bride has made herself ready the word
[1:23:25] the word bride Muellers already with the
[1:23:27] word dressed in the Word of God and
[1:23:29] that's what he said brother Branham said
[1:23:30] I came to dress the bride well he's
[1:23:33] donut hallelujah and we're so thankful
[1:23:34] for that amen not just as I as I do come
[1:23:38] up to finish here amen
[1:23:39] praise the Lord so the Bride of Christ
[1:23:41] manifesting his eternal deity and
[1:23:44] attributes cleansed by his blood
[1:23:46] sanctified set apart for service and
[1:23:48] filled with His Holy Spirit set terrain
[1:23:50] to rule with him what a day that will be
[1:23:55] and you know that Paul says to the
[1:23:59] Corinthians you know you were all kinds
[1:24:02] of people all kinds of sinners amen but
[1:24:05] he says I wish to present you as a
[1:24:09] chaste virgin to Jesus Christ know even
[1:24:13] being reasonable people you name me one
[1:24:16] man that would be worthy in the century
[1:24:19] to present this bride to Jesus Christ
[1:24:22] there's only one knot
[1:24:24] though that's the alleged himself amen
[1:24:28] that's melaka for himself
[1:24:30] that's the messenger to our day I knew
[1:24:34] we believe it folks but after somebody
[1:24:36] else that thinks of the messenger how
[1:24:38] could they ever fulfill what it says in
[1:24:42] the scripture but not messenger what he
[1:24:44] would do
[1:24:44] amen praise the Lord and what he has
[1:24:47] done so thank God for that today
[1:24:49] 9 just as am i finished with this I want
[1:24:51] to just finish up a quarter to us
[1:24:53] roughly when I started no but prison or
[1:24:55] there's something else that never came
[1:24:57] into view the new heaven and the new
[1:25:00] earth it was invisible nobody you with
[1:25:03] that praise the Lord but you know it was
[1:25:06] invisible from the creation the prophets
[1:25:09] some of them had an idea there was
[1:25:11] something you know Ibrahim I don't know
[1:25:14] who told him maybe Melchizedek I don't
[1:25:16] know who told them but I'll tell you one
[1:25:18] thing somebody told him praise God for
[1:25:21] he knew there was a city he knew there
[1:25:23] was a city it was invisible because he
[1:25:26] didn't see it but you don't see it's
[1:25:28] invisible not right amen and he searched
[1:25:31] for it brother Branham said he searched
[1:25:32] for the scripture said he searched for
[1:25:33] it hallelujah but he never find it sad
[1:25:36] right do we look for it everywhere in
[1:25:39] every hell held band maybe it's here but
[1:25:42] it wasn't there
[1:25:43] brother Brown said it was just above his
[1:25:45] head Amen that's what he said see but
[1:25:48] all aren't you glad today that John saw
[1:25:53] dot said a prayers God and it was a
[1:25:57] reality amen
[1:25:59] not just something that was invisible
[1:26:01] anymore but he said I John saw the New
[1:26:04] Jerusalem come down like a bride adorned
[1:26:07] for for amen ah the glory of it all and
[1:26:13] I knew we should come and dine onion
[1:26:15] aspersa cents the bride is that but in
[1:26:18] another sense the King always identified
[1:26:20] with the city or the rule that he had
[1:26:23] and he identified himself with that and
[1:26:26] so that's why it says the bride adorned
[1:26:28] like that amen
[1:26:30] and so he said John saw the heavenly
[1:26:32] Jerusalem descend onto the earth amen it
[1:26:36] was
[1:26:37] made visible thank God praise the Lord
[1:26:41] there is going to be a city and it's
[1:26:43] going to be 1,500 miles long my I tell
[1:26:46] you as you can't spiritual age at all
[1:26:48] folks no matter what way you do at amen
[1:26:50] I'll tell you what there's going to be
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:54] a wonderful throne there the alarm will
[1:26:58] ever be the light there amen
[1:27:00] The Tree of Life will be there the river
[1:27:02] of God will be there amen
[1:27:05] my those lovely boulevards and the trees
[1:27:09] I'm brother Branham said even then he
[1:27:12] said if you ever want to have a you know
[1:27:14] a meeting with me amen
[1:27:16] he said you come one day with the angels
[1:27:18] are singing and go right down the little
[1:27:20] seal he said you'll find me there so I'm
[1:27:23] looking for that one day to find that
[1:27:25] little trail and go down and savor
[1:27:27] Branum
[1:27:28] I'm brother George Amen praise God
[1:27:32] hallelujah amen
[1:27:34] but all what will it be when we see
[1:27:35] Jesus what will it baby was and you know
[1:27:38] something folks I wish I could have time
[1:27:41] but again I wouldn't say its
[1:27:43] controversial but you know last year
[1:27:46] when I was open Mackay's well I've been
[1:27:49] preaching here oneness that God wants us
[1:27:52] to be worn with him and character and
[1:27:53] everything you know knits or everything
[1:27:55] and I was up there and I had a dream and
[1:27:59] I woke up one morning but 6 o'clock and
[1:28:00] you know it said you've been preaching
[1:28:03] about oneness what about the seventh
[1:28:05] dimension and well I tell you what I
[1:28:07] have some thoughts in the seventh
[1:28:09] dimension and I believe with all my
[1:28:10] heart will attend that seventh dimension
[1:28:12] you say well hardly how can you say that
[1:28:14] because jesus said our Father which art
[1:28:16] in heaven amen
[1:28:18] well of God's in the seventh dimension
[1:28:19] then that's what heaven is amen
[1:28:22] and you know the sixth dimension brother
[1:28:23] Branham says oh I want to see him he
[1:28:25] says he's a little higher
[1:28:27] only one lamp seventh that's where Jesus
[1:28:29] is right nine or seven dimension so
[1:28:31] praise God but yet above when he
[1:28:32] appeared his disciples he came back
[1:28:35] return and they touched him on the
[1:28:36] hundred so can we move from one to the
[1:28:38] other or whatever not I'm not all I sure
[1:28:40] about all these things but I'll tell you
[1:28:42] what I believe there's a great future
[1:28:43] for this bride hallelujah amen
[1:28:46] so thank God for that the tree of life
[1:28:48] blooming it's going to be wonderful
[1:28:50] six and
[1:28:51] things made visible and what a day that
[1:28:54] would be when we wind up millennium when
[1:28:56] going to that New Jerusalem a man in the
[1:28:59] city with alarm is the light and I
[1:29:01] believe with all my heart and I listen
[1:29:03] you know when Jesus appeared to his
[1:29:06] disciples not one of them fell down at
[1:29:09] his feet he made them bread and on the
[1:29:12] fire and fish I'm every can be appeared
[1:29:15] in the upper room nobody fell dead but
[1:29:17] when he was in his glory and not 7 I'm
[1:29:20] John psalm John fell at his feet as dead
[1:29:23] so that's the way it is but here's what
[1:29:26] I want to say in closing and I'm in it
[1:29:28] with all my heart you know one day I
[1:29:31] believe that you will see Jesus Christ
[1:29:34] face to face and you know who's it gonna
[1:29:37] be
[1:29:37] thank you brother Samuel and who's it
[1:29:40] gonna be
[1:29:40] is it just going to be a group no it'll
[1:29:43] be you and the Lord and the vigil I
[1:29:46] brought a weird you'll walk with them
[1:29:47] and you'll talk with a man right here
[1:29:50] amen together hallelujah he's not going
[1:29:54] to be sitting on the throne and all that
[1:29:55] glory but you'd fall at his feet no
[1:29:57] he'll be there just like he was because
[1:29:59] you'll come into where you are at and
[1:30:01] you'll walk with you and he'll talk with
[1:30:03] you what a day that will be what a day
[1:30:06] that will be - common folks praise God
[1:30:10] because we know all the scripture and
[1:30:12] you know something the scripture cannot
[1:30:15] be broken so that's what it's going to
[1:30:18] happen brother Jerry that's gonna happen
[1:30:20] god bless you today it's time for the
[1:30:23] communion god bless you partake of it
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:26] that's our new covenant that is it
[1:30:28] really before the Lord and I'm glad to

[1:30:33] bless you I hope that's bless you this
[1:30:35] afternoon today it's just been a
[1:30:38] blessing to you and that is my desire
[1:30:40] above all things this is the most
[1:30:43] important to me is to be with you I'm
[1:30:45] with the word and share it together and
[1:30:48] whatever praise the Lord brother Samuel
[1:30:50] said to me oh brother George you know
[1:30:52] the Lord spoke to me during the night
[1:30:53] I've got something to say that search I
[1:30:54] just said here beside with that's what
[1:30:56] you think I wouldn't I would I let him
[1:30:58] speak speak whatever's on his heart say
[1:31:00] so god bless you it's been a joy thank
[1:31:03] you for for all that you do for me
[1:31:05] for all your prayers mostly amen because
[1:31:08] God hears on the answers prayer and I've
[1:31:10] been a recipient of that I believe that
[1:31:12] you know so god bless you / Samuel

[1:31:16] God bless you and thank you
[1:31:18] amen praise God because God makes you

[1:31:25] you say Amen let's give our brother good
[1:31:27] a why we believe it we believe it true
[1:31:34] it is true so that's that's the way it
[1:31:38] goes and it comes down to the end and
[1:31:41] you're going to understand all things I
[1:31:43] believe that the Lord is unbold
[1:31:47] unveiling his word unto us and it won't
[1:31:51] be invisible anymore because the
[1:31:55] invisible is made visible where we can
[1:31:59] see it right here we don't have to wait
[1:32:01] we get dark no it's going to be right
[1:32:04] here because according to my
[1:32:06] understanding I thought we meet him in
[1:32:08] there so we do is when I have to become
[1:32:10] visible the Prophet sit among us MA and
[1:32:13] raise the dead okay we go in the rapture
[1:32:16] that's a wonderful thing to look forward
[1:32:18] to in infancy to know and to know
[1:32:21] assuredly that all is well done amen
[1:32:25] before we come to the communion anybody
[1:32:28] have anything they need to get rid of
[1:32:30] and everything's and I'd say do that now
[1:32:33] you know finish that part up and I just
[1:32:38] want to say this I believe some of you
[1:32:45] are setting our texting while the
[1:32:49] service is going on it happened this
[1:32:52] morning it happened - seeing it now I've
[1:32:57] asked you not to do it you say yeah but
[1:33:03] Rowan's also have asked you to turn off
[1:33:05] your phone
[1:33:06] well I can't turn 1830 mine I'll call my
[1:33:09] mom and my dad you mean God I don't know
[1:33:12] all about things and it could be then
[1:33:16] very easy could if somebody did
[1:33:19] you you can just - okay that's all you
[1:33:22] got to do but this morning it done it it
[1:33:27] bothered me you said what you can't even
[1:33:29] hear Brazil that's what I'm telling you
[1:33:33] it's even that's been very prevalent
[1:33:35] throughout the service don't do that
[1:33:41] don't have your mind on everything else
[1:33:44] you're supposed to be on the Lord you
[1:33:47] can take care of you texting and your
[1:33:49] talking and everything later you'd say
[1:33:52] well these kids I don't think it was a
[1:33:54] kid because the Lord wouldn't speak to
[1:33:57] me about it I think it's somebody else
[1:34:03] well I had to do this and I do that you
[1:34:05] make your own excuses just remember you
[1:34:11] will answer for your doing and your
[1:34:14] excuses won't be any good because like I
[1:34:17] said it now line language always been
[1:34:19] straight if somebody text you and said
[1:34:22] call me say later and that's it you
[1:34:28] don't have to make contact you just and
[1:34:33] you're finished with it so okay now I've
[1:34:36] warned you even though that's just a
[1:34:39] point because I know some of you set in
[1:34:41] text and do things while the service is
[1:34:44] going on so I'm telling you don't do it
[1:34:49] so as we go into the communion then we
[1:34:53] come to the place it is a marvelous
[1:34:56] position a situation that we're able
[1:34:58] while we're here to participate in
[1:35:03] something that will actually as it's
[1:35:09] taking place now here in this world that
[1:35:13] we get to do this because ordained to
[1:35:15] the Lord but you know what when we leave
[1:35:17] here so we're going to take communion
[1:35:20] that is actually related to the world
[1:35:24] physically we will take it and then when
[1:35:28] we go into glory the first thing we get
[1:35:30] it's a marriage supper
[1:35:32] is the communion that's how much the two
[1:35:36] worlds is tied by the blood of Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ so let's just have a moment spur
[1:35:44] and this praise that the Lord would you
[1:35:45] know take care of everything and then
[1:35:48] we'll just have the one with silent
[1:35:50] prayers we always try to and then we'll
[1:35:52] go in through the communion okay
[1:36:14] just cleanse us all through your blood
[1:36:16] Lord make us to be worthy of all things
[1:36:21] just make us to be worth it we can
[1:36:24] actually protect the communion and to no
[1:36:27] one realize that our Lord has ordained
[1:36:29] this as I said for us to do in this
[1:36:31] world and there will be a marvelous
[1:36:34] thing that when we get there we can take
[1:36:37] it again in order to be a great time
[1:36:40] there what a great time at this time
[1:36:42] have your way with all of us that we may
[1:36:45] all be together do in Jesus name Paul in
[1:36:52] first corinthians says prior received of
[1:36:58] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:37:00] unto you but the Lord Jesus the same
[1:37:03] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:37:04] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:37:07] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:37:09] body which is broken for you
[1:37:11] this doing remembrance of me after the
[1:37:15] same manner also he took the cup when it
[1:37:17] shook saying this cup is the New
[1:37:19] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:37:22] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[1:37:24] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:37:27] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[1:37:29] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:37:31] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:37:33] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:37:36] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:37:39] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:37:41] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:37:43] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:37:44] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:37:47] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:37:49] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:37:52] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:37:56] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:37:58] be judged well that's that's a good
[1:38:01] statement a good though but when we
[1:38:03] don't do it this is what I like but when
[1:38:06] we argue that in other words we don't
[1:38:07] straighten it up but God has to move on
[1:38:10] the scene but when we are judged we are
[1:38:13] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:38:17] be condemned with the world what if he
[1:38:19] didn't chasing us where would it be all
[1:38:21] right wherefore my brethren when you
[1:38:23] come together to eat tarry one for
[1:38:25] another
[1:38:25] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:38:27] home that you come out together in the
[1:38:30] condemnation and the rest what I said in
[1:38:32] order when I come
[1:38:42] father we thank you that this read has
[1:38:45] been made for this purpose today this
[1:38:48] purpose only as for us to be able to
[1:38:51] protect we know it's not your body we
[1:38:55] know it represents you how much more
[1:38:58] would it be Lord it will never be your
[1:39:01] body because when we get dire and we eat
[1:39:04] the communion we would take of it with
[1:39:06] you in glory
[1:39:07] you'll simply are with us on it but
[1:39:09] they'll still be telling us what you
[1:39:11] think of this because this to us means
[1:39:13] one thing you said it to the disciples
[1:39:16] this is the New Testament in my blood
[1:39:21] so then what else would we need and the
[1:39:24] Word of God to be brought unto us and in
[1:39:28] the spirit to quicken it sanctify the
[1:39:30] bread and the protectors that we may all
[1:39:32] be together as wanting you in Jesus name
[1:39:46] what a wonderful opportunity when they'd
[1:39:51] been something to been back dire and
[1:39:55] been able to take the communion with him
[1:39:58] you know but what about now as rather
[1:40:05] brother was bringing the message
[1:40:06] I thought we believe that he's now
[1:40:09] crossing us I didn't think it was
[1:40:13] absolute hell I thought it was in us
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:16] now in us that he lives well and we are
[1:40:21] his tabernacle we are that holy of
[1:40:25] Holy's that spoke of back garden all the
[1:40:29] things happen all that was speaking of
[1:40:33] that new work that would come into our
[1:40:34] soul to give us eternal life this is a
[1:40:39] to make and forth of that into
[1:40:41] manifestation we thank the Lord for
[1:40:44] truth aid we know that it's not the
[1:40:48] blood yet it speaks of it but what about
[1:40:54] a type of shadow to speak a wonderful
[1:40:57] time in Amen Lord Jesus we thank you for
[1:41:02] this wine has been made for this purpose
[1:41:03] today that purpose is Lord for us to be
[1:41:08] able to just take a little piece of
[1:41:10] bread and follow the example that you
[1:41:12] gave us a little wine to drink to
[1:41:15] understand the hour that we live and you
[1:41:18] would quicken the word and to us will
[1:41:20] give us life yes we love you and we
[1:41:22] thank you sanctify the bridge they
[1:41:25] provide a wine sanctify the protector
[1:41:27] and we may all be together as one in you
[1:41:30] in Jesus noises
[1:41:43] come morning I walk by the river
[1:41:53] arrest me the evergreen free I'll carry
[1:42:02] my cross through the midnight
[1:42:09] come morning DARS glory for me sometimes
[1:42:19] I despised and rejected and I questioned
[1:42:27] Oh father how long then I take one more
[1:42:36] look at Mount Calvary and it gives me
[1:42:43] the strength to go on
[1:42:49] come morning I walk by the river I'll
[1:42:58] rest me the other green cream I'll carry
[1:43:08] my cross through the midnight come
[1:43:15] morning there's glory for me things are
[1:43:25] moving so fast around the world on
[1:43:27] coming to a close and brother branham
[1:43:29] say that what that I got to back up wait
[1:43:33] on this other to catch up well I think
[1:43:35] it's catching up pretty good you know I
[1:43:39] think the world's getting in the right
[1:43:40] place one stroke of a pen can change the
[1:43:44] whole world all today
[1:43:47] yeah just one one little stroke 1pn mark
[1:43:52] and it can close out everything the
[1:43:55] money you have in your pocket would be
[1:43:57] worth nothing because they're the ones
[1:44:03] printing it it will come to a place that
[1:44:07] you just try to print more it ain't
[1:44:09] going to help much but then to go then
[1:44:15] that is the end of all things
[1:44:18] what a wonderful time the greatest day
[1:44:22] of all the world oh we were talking
[1:44:23] yesterday but the greatest day of all
[1:44:26] the world is here now to know that the
[1:44:31] end is here everything in the Bible
[1:44:36] speaks of this day you say if I could
[1:44:41] have just been back there I want to be
[1:44:45] here too and greatest of all days I want
[1:44:49] to be here to see it finished a man
[1:44:52] let's protect together
[1:45:02] you can be seated for a moment too we
[1:45:06] come to the get through I'll read the
[1:45:10] scriptures in John and supper being
[1:45:17] ended the devil having now put into the
[1:45:20] heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to
[1:45:22] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[1:45:25] had given all things into his hands that
[1:45:28] he was come from God and went to God he
[1:45:32] rises from suffering laid aside his
[1:45:34] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:45:36] himself after that he poured water into
[1:45:39] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:45:40] feet and wipe them with the towel
[1:45:43] wherewith he was girded then coming he
[1:45:46] to Simon Peter and Peter said unto Him
[1:45:48] Lord that I wash my feet jesus answered
[1:45:51] and said unto him what I do die no it's
[1:45:54] not now but I shall know hereafter Peter
[1:45:58] saith unto him I shall never wash my
[1:46:00] feet jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:46:04] not thou it's no part with me Simon
[1:46:07] Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet
[1:46:09] only also my hands in the head
[1:46:12] jesus said them to him is washed needeth
[1:46:16] not saved to wash his feet but it's
[1:46:21] clean every wit and your are clean but
[1:46:25] not all for he knew who should betray
[1:46:28] him darfur said he you're in our all
[1:46:31] clean so after he had washed her feet
[1:46:34] and taken his garments and were sat down
