[26:50] john 1 1. in the beginning was the word
[26:51] the word was with god the word was god
[26:53] let's drop down to verse 10. he was in
[26:55] the world
[26:57] we were talking this morning the world
[26:58] was made by him and the world knew him
[27:00] not
[27:01] he came unto his own and his own
[27:03] received him not but as many as received
[27:05] him
[27:06] to them gave he power to become the sons
[27:08] of god even to them that believe
[27:11] on his name which were born not of blood
[27:13] nor the will of flesh nor the will of
[27:15] man but of god
[27:18] and this word was made flesh whatever we
[27:20] were talking about all that up there
[27:22] from 1 through 13 we were talking about
[27:25] john and then talking about the lord
[27:27] jesus the word was made flesh and dwelt
[27:30] among us and we beheld his glory of the
[27:31] glory the only begotten of the father
[27:33] full of grace and truth you may be
[27:35] seated in the lord as blessing
[27:37] to the reading of the word
[27:39] and we'll go ahead and go to hebrews 10.
[27:41] we've read this before but i want you to
[27:43] really understand that wherefore he
[27:45] cometh into the world he saith sacrifice
[27:47] an offering thou would have not in other
[27:48] words it wasn't the sacrifices it wasn't
[27:50] the offerings
[27:52] that didn't now it did bring jesus
[27:53] christ on the scene but that wasn't
[27:55] jesus christ
[27:56] the offerings in the old testament was
[27:58] not jesus it was a pre-figure or it was
[28:01] an example
[28:02] of the one sacrifice as we looked in the
[28:05] book of hebrews and bob going through it
[28:07] where it says that
[28:08] that sacrifice doesn't have to be made
[28:10] over and over again jesus christ was a
[28:12] was the supreme sacrifice no other
[28:15] sacrifice is needed after that i hope we
[28:17] see that and the bible tells us though
[28:19] that we need to be the sacrifice we need
[28:21] to sacrifice our life amen which is our
[28:24] reasonable service the bible tells us to

[29:36] of character

[29:41] and if nothing else we get out of this
[29:43] message of the hour that we love so well
[29:46] and to talk about the seals and the
[29:48] daniel 70 weeks and all this it's the
[29:50] life
[29:51] that we're projecting to the world that
[29:53] yes we are different
[29:56] and we can be different see that's a
[29:58] testimony that those girls can stand
[30:00] here and be above the world
[30:03] not do as the world i'm talking about
[30:05] all you sisters that do that but they
[30:07] were up here and i was going god
[30:09] that picture
[30:12] that picture
[30:13] that's what you wanted
[30:15] you wanted a pure virtuous sinless bride
[30:18] without spot or
[30:20] wrinkle singing the praises of god
[30:24] playing the instruments and not doing it
[30:26] for show or money or
[30:29] doing it for the glory of god amen amen
[30:32] don't ever lose that
[30:34] don't ever lose that young ladies young
[30:36] men young ladies don't ever lose that
[30:39] you're in this world but you don't have
[30:40] to be of this world
[30:42] this world will drag you down tear you
[30:44] up spit you out and never turn around
[30:46] and look at you again
[30:48] amen that's what the devil will do
[30:51] if he ever gets him gets you a little
[30:52] bit now
[30:54] i know we all have testimonies but
[30:56] i can testify myself that
[30:59] i wasn't a good guy
[31:02] but god saved my soul
[31:05] i wasted 20 years of my life
[31:08] wasted it because it gained me nothing
[31:11] right right oh yeah i was a good guy i
[31:13] was a good husband i was good at this
[31:15] and get that i was worthless and you're
[31:18] worthless without god
[31:20] you're worthless it's like brother john
[31:22] said perfect example
[31:25] where are you going to end up
[31:27] if bill gates doesn't get the baptism of
[31:29] the holy ghost he's going to hell i
[31:32] don't care how much money you make
[31:34] amen because he didn't accept jesus
[31:36] christ as a savior the simplest thing
[31:38] you can do and a billionaire can't do
[31:41] that
[31:42] that's the god we serve made it so
[31:44] simple yes i don't know why i'm doing
[31:46] this man but it's so simple
[31:50] that not one person that hits this earth
[31:52] and breathes a breath
[31:55] does not have that same opportunity
[31:57] every person
[31:58] it's all no over in india no
[32:01] if you have a desire in your heart god
[32:02] will send somebody over there amen god
[32:05] will send you somebody if you have a
[32:06] desire because you know what he said he
[32:08] would give you the desire of your heart
[32:10] and the desire of your heart is what
[32:12] either to serve god or serve the devil
[32:15] one of the two there's not anything in
[32:17] between
[32:18] amen that's why we counsel with the
[32:20] girls and counsel or young ladies and
[32:21] counsel with the young men and have
[32:23] these youth
[32:24] youth meetings and stuff to to get them
[32:26] to feel important number one
[32:29] they're important they're important to
[32:30] us they're important to god
[32:32] but to keep yourself clean to keep
[32:34] yourself
[32:35] away from the world
[32:37] and the things of the world because
[32:38] listen a lot of us didn't
[32:40] and we carry scholars
[32:43] and that's why we want to be so adamant
[32:45] about
[32:46] sheltering and preaching and teaching
[32:49] and doing these things for the youth
[32:52] so that you won't make the same mistakes
[32:53] we did
[32:54] amen
[32:56] so you can be a as we're talking about
[32:58] today a sinless virtuous
[33:01] bride of jesus christ
[33:03] because you get born again that's what
[33:04] you are oh you got problems in your
[33:06] flesh sure and problems in your spirit
[33:09] realm but not in your soul
[33:11] your soul is just as eternal as god is
[33:13] it is the eternal of god amen
[33:16] so let's continue here
[33:18] hebrews 10 5 a body has now prepared me
[33:22] we were talking about this morning
[33:23] there's a literal body that was prepared
[33:25] that came onto this earth 2 000 years
[33:27] ago in a city called bethlehem not on
[33:30] december the 25th
[33:32] but in april
[33:34] and
[33:35] he brought a natural body in but the
[33:38] only reason that natural body came is is
[33:40] because in the garden of eden there was
[33:42] a marriage between adam and eve but that
[33:44] marriage didn't get consummated like god
[33:47] wanted it consummated the devil stepped
[33:49] in and he consummated it
[33:53] to a beast
[33:54] and that's what caused all this that
[33:55] we're dealing with now but god knew that
[33:58] so he sent he had to come in a literal
[34:00] body to then begin to build his
[34:02] spiritual body
[34:04] amen that's what he was telling
[34:06] nicodemus he's a nicodemus your first
[34:08] birth is not it's what's killing you you
[34:11] need another birth
[34:12] that's fine i'll read here in just a few
[34:14] minutes where brother branham told us
[34:16] and we've read it many times but we were
[34:18] going to read it again where he said i
[34:20] don't i just don't know that we're
[34:21] getting them to christ
[34:23] and are we
[34:25] i want to ask you a question are we
[34:27] getting our kids and our
[34:30] um and our wives and husbands that don't
[34:32] serve the lord in different ones are we
[34:34] getting them to christ or we're just
[34:35] saying you got to believe this message
[34:38] you got to believe this message
[34:42] well get them to christ first
[34:45] you get them nailed into christ and i'll
[34:47] promise you promise you
[34:49] they'll come to the message
[34:51] amen they'll come to the message of the
[34:52] hour
[34:53] but they've got to get the new birth
[34:55] first
[34:56] because the new birth is not the message
[34:58] of the hour in that form that is just
[34:59] the message of the hour no the new birth
[35:02] is knowing that jesus christ died for
[35:04] your soul
[35:07] gave his soul a ransom so he could see
[35:09] his seed and that's what you are you are
[35:10] the seed of god as
[35:12] brother bob was talking about this
[35:14] morning so the marriage vows were were
[35:17] were marred in the garden jesus christ
[35:20] came and remember he didn't get married
[35:21] because he didn't need to be married he
[35:23] was looking for a spiritual bride
[35:27] that was going to though become flesh
[35:31] listen
[35:32] that's why he didn't when he created the
[35:33] genesis 1 26 man that was a spirit man
[35:37] that didn't have flesh
[35:38] i was a spirit man
[35:40] but see god didn't want to keep that
[35:42] because he showed what he wanted to do
[35:44] when he dropped down into 2 7 genesis 2
[35:47] verse 7 and said i'm going to put that
[35:49] in human flesh
[35:52] that's what he wanted to do he wanted
[35:54] always to live with us in human flesh
[35:57] always
[35:58] that way he can fellowship with us
[36:00] remember he fellowship with adam he
[36:02] fellowship with eve he went down and
[36:03] through the garden and fellowship with
[36:05] him
[36:06] in the garden adam and eve that was his
[36:08] wife
[36:09] they had just not consummated the
[36:11] marriage and i don't think they have to
[36:12] consummate it like we consummated now
[36:14] because it's a spoken word of god not by
[36:17] sex is anything worth anything
[36:19] amen
[36:21] but we have to have it to get here so
[36:23] it's all right because
[36:25] um
[36:28] it's permitted by god
[36:29] okay
[36:30] the bed's undefiled so just don't worry
[36:32] don't when we talk about i don't want
[36:34] you to see those two
[36:35] schools of thought you don't want to say
[36:37] well sex is bad it's not if it's done
[36:40] right it's like brother brown said
[36:42] everything's right if it's done right
[36:44] it's not if it's done wrong
[36:46] so you go do it right ladies and
[36:49] gentlemen
[36:50] and then whatever that that's then
[36:52] that's sanctioned by god the same way
[36:53] with anything with god
[36:55] amen
[36:57] what brother brown said
[36:58] adultery is what adulterous act is
[37:00] against god but the right act
[37:03] is ordained of god amen same act
[37:06] but you got to go the right way
[37:08] all right that's why the marriage in
[37:10] divorce situation we don't we're not
[37:12] going to get into it but that's what
[37:13] messed up the beginning that's why
[37:15] brother brown had to preach marriage in
[37:16] divorce it's because the marriage vows
[37:18] is what got missing in the in the in the
[37:20] garden
[37:21] it was the adam and eve were presented
[37:23] and said here here this is this is what
[37:25] you're going to do multiply and
[37:26] replenish the earth satan jumps right in
[37:29] the middle of it and brings his own
[37:30] thought into it through the beast
[37:33] and he
[37:34] commits adultery
[37:37] we leave
[37:38] so then god said okay don't worry i'll
[37:40] put enmity between you
[37:42] there's a division now between me and
[37:44] you but i'm going to bring it back
[37:45] together because of the woman's seed
[37:48] which is the person we're talking about
[37:49] the literal body of jesus christ
[37:51] had to come on this earth so that the
[37:53] spiritual body could come out of it and
[37:55] then that spiritual body though whether
[37:57] we go by the grave or whether we go to
[37:59] the body change we're all going to be in
[38:00] human flesh
[38:02] for an
[38:02] eternity because jesus christ what he
[38:05] didn't throw his flesh away and get him
[38:07] a new one
[38:08] when he resurrected he resurrected in
[38:10] the same flesh or there would have been
[38:12] something left in the tomb
[38:16] huh there would have been something left
[38:19] in the tomb that is an empty tomb
[38:22] there's nothing in there because
[38:23] whatever was in there is out right and
[38:26] then he came back on the day of
[38:27] pentecost in the baptism of the holy
[38:29] ghost into your flesh and now we can say
[38:33] the word has been made flesh again
[38:36] you and i
[38:37] are the word made flesh
[38:40] if you have the baptism of the holy
[38:42] ghost
[38:43] ephesians 5 23 said for the husband
[38:46] is the head of the wife
[38:48] even as christ is the head of the church
[38:50] and he is the savior
[38:52] of the body
[38:54] which that's what you and i we are the
[38:55] body all right let's go to colossians 1
[38:58] 15 i want to hurry through this and get
[38:59] to something
[39:01] at the end who is the image of the
[39:02] invisible god
[39:04] the firstborn of every creature
[39:09] he was born right
[39:11] now we can't help being born wrong
[39:15] not one of you decided to be born
[39:18] okay
[39:20] you did not decide that
[39:22] it was the divine providence of god that
[39:24] got you here
[39:25] amen
[39:27] mean what brother brown said he said
[39:29] it's more a miracle
[39:31] for the natural birth than it is for the
[39:34] virgin birth
[39:35] virgin birth was one seed one germ
[39:38] put in the womb of mary and there's baby
[39:40] jesus
[39:42] that's not don't happen with us
[39:45] this one and this one this one and this
[39:47] one why do you say that this one was
[39:48] bred to this one to get you here
[39:51] that's a miracle
[39:53] but he had to be the firstborn of every
[39:55] creature because listen our first birth
[39:57] killed us
[39:59] his first birth saved us he didn't need
[40:01] a new birth he didn't say nicodemus now
[40:03] me and you need to be born again now he
[40:05] said nicodemus you need to be born again
[40:08] because you came a different way than i
[40:09] did see nicodemus couldn't understand
[40:11] that because what's the first thing he
[40:12] said he said if i got to go back and get
[40:15] into my mother's womb
[40:17] see natural right
[40:19] and be born again no
[40:21] then that's going to kill you again
[40:24] so you got to be born jesus said what
[40:26] from above
[40:28] you're born from above you're born from
[40:30] heaven
[40:31] sitting in heavenly places
[40:33] but he had to be the firstborn there had
[40:35] to be one come to the first fruits there
[40:36] had to be one that lived these virtues
[40:39] there had to be one that lived joy peace
[40:42] longsuffering and all that he had to be
[40:44] the example we had to have an example
[40:46] amen and it wasn't it wasn't given to a
[40:49] man now listen isaiah had a part
[40:51] jeremiah had a part ezekiel had a part
[40:55] david had a part
[40:57] solomon had a part each one of them had
[40:59] a part
[41:00] but they weren't the fullness
[41:03] so they finished their work in malachi
[41:06] and then it took four you know when you
[41:07] flip that page from malachi
[41:10] to where it says new testament
[41:12] 400 years elapsed during that time that
[41:15] one page flip
[41:17] because from malachi to jesus was 400
[41:19] years there wasn't a prophet on
[41:21] on the ground until john the baptist
[41:23] showed up
[41:24] and said behold
[41:26] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[41:27] of the world i've come to introduce
[41:29] something what he come to introduce
[41:31] christ
[41:33] the literal man to the earth
[41:39] it's okay to say amen
[41:41] those of you that are awake
[41:45] for in him were all things created that
[41:47] are in heaven or earth visible and
[41:49] invisible whether they be thrones or
[41:51] dominions or principalities or powers
[41:53] all things were created by him before
[41:55] who's this him
[41:58] jesus christ
[41:59] but not the body
[42:01] the body developed 2 000 years ago this
[42:03] is the son of god this is a creator that
[42:05] said let there be
[42:07] because jesus stood one day and he said
[42:09] before abraham was i am
[42:11] now that flesh didn't say that
[42:14] what was inside said that amen
[42:17] all this and he is before all things and
[42:20] by him all things consist
[42:24] now who is this guy
[42:26] he's the head of the body the church
[42:29] the bride
[42:30] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[42:32] the dead that in all things he might
[42:34] have the preeminence we were talking
[42:35] about this morning the preeminence of
[42:37] god
[42:38] means
[42:41] that he has
[42:42] first
[42:44] he has first choice
[42:47] you make him the first choice when you
[42:48] make any decision
[42:50] that's what preeminence says he is the
[42:52] preeminent one when you do something in
[42:54] your life he's thought of first
[42:58] anything that's why the bible says seek
[43:00] ye first the kingdom of god and then all
[43:01] these other things will come into place
[43:03] what if you give him the preeminence
[43:06] and that's what working on brother brown
[43:08] says that's going to be hard for us to
[43:09] do really is to give him the
[43:11] preeminences because we've been here
[43:12] 2000 years after he said that and we're
[43:15] still here that in all things he might
[43:17] have the preeminence for it please the
[43:19] father that in him should all
[43:22] fullness
[43:23] dwell all right let's go to the
[43:25] masterpiece
[43:27] and just kind of jump through this real
[43:28] quick what we're talking about this
[43:30] morning
[43:33] and then came finally the great head the
[43:34] head of all of it the rest of the body
[43:36] just spoke of it the foundation was laid
[43:39] by the patriarch
[43:40] but the body was built by the word which
[43:43] was the prophets and here comes the head
[43:44] of it all jesus comes on the scene
[43:47] now
[43:48] why was jesus the head of all
[43:53] why was he the headstone
[43:55] why was he the capstone why was he the
[43:57] head of the corner why was he the rock
[43:59] of stumbling of rock of a fence why was
[44:01] he all these things
[44:02] you ever asked that question ask
[44:04] yourself that every once in a while
[44:06] why does it say he's all these things
[44:10] because he is
[44:12] he came here to make a church
[44:15] and he's the only one who could do it
[44:16] the right way
[44:18] so he's the head he's the preeminent one
[44:22] that we have everything flows from him
[44:24] to us everything flows from him to us
[44:30] because he's the apex of everything he's
[44:32] what god manifested in human flesh no
[44:35] more no less
[44:37] so the body was built by the word which
[44:39] was the prophets and here comes the head
[44:40] of it all jesus came on the scene so
[44:43] listen
[44:45] the headship
[44:47] of the church
[44:49] is who
[44:51] the denomination
[44:55] james dobson
[44:57] jensen franklin uh you know name them
[44:59] all
[45:00] i just
[45:01] remembered those
[45:03] is that the preeminent one is that the
[45:05] one that that created well yeah they
[45:06] caught they got this they made this
[45:08] church over here the pope made the
[45:09] catholic church and this one started
[45:10] this church and it started
[45:12] who's the preeminent one in the bible
[45:14] who's the only one who can save your
[45:16] soul
[45:17] who's the only one that can put these
[45:19] virtues inside of you
[45:22] and help you live them
[45:23] that's one man that's jesus christ
[45:26] that's why we have to get back to the
[45:27] word of god not to a denominational idea
[45:30] that somebody just came up with
[45:34] i can't take that i can't take an idea
[45:36] that somebody just came up with
[45:38] i got to be able to read it in the bible
[45:40] that's why i'm telling you the other day
[45:41] every doctrine that we are different
[45:44] than the world
[45:45] it's written right here
[45:47] so whose problem is it hours no bible no
[45:51] somebody interjected their own thought
[45:53] into this thing
[45:56] amen
[45:56] there's no trinity in the bible never
[45:58] has been never will be
[46:01] none
[46:03] listen when you have headship you don't
[46:05] have four husbands
[46:07] you don't have three husbands you don't
[46:09] have two husbands
[46:11] one husband
[46:13] and if jesus is our one husband then he
[46:16] must be god almighty in human flesh
[46:18] amen
[46:20] or then we're married to another which
[46:22] is very simple but the world stumbles at
[46:24] it we're going to read it in just a
[46:25] minute everything that he did the world
[46:28] stumbled at
[46:30] it's like dad always said it's kind of
[46:32] like you know you you've got a football
[46:33] field of 300 yards or 300 feet 100 yards
[46:37] long 50 yards wide
[46:39] and you got one little rock about this
[46:41] big and it's right out just somewhere
[46:42] like on the 40-yard line
[46:46] i mean a herd of elephants wouldn't hit
[46:48] it
[46:49] if you send them from one end to the
[46:50] other but the bible says he's become the
[46:52] stumbling stone
[46:53] a rock of a fence and it's going to
[46:55] you're going to trip over it it's like
[46:57] having that big old field and you just
[46:59] all of a sudden you're running right
[47:00] toward that one stone and you're going
[47:01] to fall right over it why they didn't
[47:03] understand who he was that's what my
[47:04] whole point is you
[47:06] the world does not understand
[47:10] the son of man
[47:11] the world does not understand you and i
[47:16] to this moment doesn't understand it 100
[47:18] but we're getting there
[47:20] we at least have a way to get
[47:22] there thank god
[47:25] we can open up a book thank god we can
[47:27] listen to a message and press play
[47:29] whenever we want to press it
[47:32] but this body was built by the word and
[47:34] the word got so eroded down to the
[47:35] church ages they added the catechism
[47:38] they added um um
[47:40] this i believe this is it i believe this
[47:43] is it well i believe he was born in
[47:44] december well i believe he was the
[47:46] second person of the trinity well i
[47:47] believe he was this i don't believe he
[47:49] was all the way god and i believe he was
[47:50] part of the way god
[47:54] that's how these things get started
[47:55] folks
[47:57] what listen
[47:58] when when paul and peter
[48:01] lived on this earth
[48:04] there was not a baptist church on every
[48:06] corner
[48:07] there wasn't a methodist church on every
[48:09] corner
[48:10] there wasn't a presbyterian church on
[48:11] every corner there was one church
[48:14] but afterwards
[48:16] paul said grievous wolves are going to
[48:18] come in peter said the antichrist is
[48:21] going to show up and he's going to start
[48:24] what what is the denomination
[48:27] division
[48:29] common denominator
[48:31] it's a division why would you want to be
[48:33] divided
[48:35] it's not going to be a street corner for
[48:37] baptist and methodist and pentecostals
[48:40] and that don't make us different but i'm
[48:42] telling you we are different
[48:44] we are different you better expect
[48:46] yourself to be different you better let
[48:48] the world know you're different it's
[48:50] like martin luther stood up that day and
[48:51] they said oh martin luther said the
[48:53] world's against you he said let me tell
[48:55] you today
[48:56] he said if it had a loud speaker i
[48:58] believe he said let me tell the world
[49:00] i'm against them
[49:03] i don't care if the world's against me
[49:06] if you love the things of the world the
[49:08] love of the father is not in you know
[49:10] what the bible's saying
[49:12] now we have to live in the world we have
[49:13] to work we have to do all these things
[49:14] but we don't have to love being here
[49:17] that's our problem we get comfortable
[49:19] yeah
[49:21] oh got a good job
[49:23] government's giving me 12 1500
[49:25] not to do nothing
[49:32] we drive cars that cost more than that
[49:34] first little trailer that i bought i'm
[49:36] trying to think how much it was what
[49:37] about six thousand dollars
[49:39] wasn't that much mama said it wasn't
[49:40] that much
[49:43] i had a motorcycle was worth more than
[49:45] that three thousand dollars mama said is
[49:47] that first little trailer i was telling
[49:48] you about that we bought so
[49:51] yeah it was because i remember paying it
[49:53] for it okay
[49:54] but see what we've come from
[49:57] we've come from
[49:59] that to this
[50:03] but have we come from
[50:05] starting with god
[50:07] in a baby form
[50:10] and now more mature
[50:13] a better house
[50:16] i'm not worried about that like brother
[50:17] john said you know you can live in a a
[50:19] mansion if you want to
[50:22] but when you pass away they're going to
[50:23] put you in a six-foot box
[50:27] and somebody else is gonna get your
[50:29] house
[50:31] right
[50:32] and if you don't pay your bills the irs
[50:33] will get it
[50:35] they can have it
[50:38] but give me the lord
[50:39] it's not bad to have fine things you all
[50:41] know that we we've never taught to not
[50:43] not be
[50:44] to not have money i want all you kids to
[50:46] go to school and get a good job because
[50:47] that's required now
[50:49] it's required that you get a good
[50:51] education to get a job and i you know if
[50:53] time goes on i don't want you to be
[50:54] paupers i want you to have a good job
[50:56] because that means you pay good time
[50:59] there's always a motive behind it sister
[51:01] always a motive
[51:05] but the body was built by the word which
[51:06] was the prophets and here comes the head
[51:08] of it all jesus comes on the scene then
[51:10] this head piece was put upon it i want
[51:12] you to understand something watch this
[51:14] this head piece was put upon it
[51:18] all right i want you to keep that
[51:20] thought because later on we're going to
[51:21] look at something
[51:24] because that headpiece had to fit
[51:25] perfect right
[51:27] i don't i don't have a you know don't
[51:29] get me wrong sister rebecca she's a
[51:31] pretty girl pretty lady
[51:33] but her head on my
[51:34] body ugly
[51:37] right
[51:40] so jesus didn't come with a deformed
[51:41] body he didn't come with a deformed head
[51:43] he came to put my this is my point he
[51:46] came to put the perfect head on a
[51:48] perfect body
[51:51] he cut that's what he come to do he come
[51:53] to right the wrong
[51:55] what happened in the garden was wrong it
[51:57] was hideous it was horrible
[52:02] horrible so he just took all that
[52:05] horribleness
[52:08] and came down here and said i'll take
[52:10] care of it right
[52:12] i'll fit the right body on the right
[52:13] head
[52:14] i'll fit the right head on the right
[52:16] body
[52:17] i'll make this thing work
[52:19] you just got to believe in me
[52:21] right
[52:22] he that believes in me
[52:25] will have life everlasting amen not me
[52:27] you know jesus i'm talking about him not
[52:29] me
[52:31] now again now watch now here's watch
[52:33] brother brown goes through all this we
[52:35] find in him the perfect reflection of
[52:36] the word for he was the word the
[52:38] fullness of the word now again
[52:41] god has the perfect masterpiece again
[52:43] who's he talking about it's all about
[52:44] the bride that's right now the perfect
[52:47] masterpieces on the earth they might
[52:50] have been missing a foot or an ankle or
[52:51] an arm or or something but now today
[52:55] this is the complete word of god
[52:57] this is the open book this is listen
[53:00] when when michelangelo
[53:03] walked up to that big
[53:05] i think it was the statue was like four
[53:07] feet by
[53:08] three feet or something the one of moses
[53:10] that michelangelo took
[53:12] do you know that
[53:14] to me and you that just looked like a
[53:15] block of granite
[53:17] they rolled that granite in there and
[53:19] set it down on the floor and
[53:20] michelangelo looked at it he was a
[53:22] master builder he looked at it and he
[53:23] said
[53:28] i can already see the image inside there
[53:31] it didn't develop somewhere else
[53:34] it always was there
[53:37] it was always in there it just had to
[53:39] come from the mind of the builder
[53:42] and he had to remember to knock off
[53:44] listen if he just went in there and
[53:45] started whacking away well he might have
[53:47] knocked the head off of it that was in
[53:49] that image
[53:50] but no
[53:51] he chipped away for 2 000 years he's
[53:54] been chipping away
[53:58] and now if you'll read the masterpiece
[54:00] brother brown said now he said it's the
[54:02] honing age it's not the chipping off age
[54:05] you're not chipping b you know used to
[54:07] he probably chipped off big pieces
[54:09] big hunks but when he got down to that
[54:11] detail
[54:12] he used a little bitty chisel
[54:18] and then what's the last thing you do
[54:19] when you have a masterpiece
[54:22] you polish it that's right you take you
[54:24] some
[54:25] oh you have to go to church and listen
[54:27] to the preacher
[54:28] and he just does this right here to your
[54:30] flesh he
[54:32] he just
[54:34] just makes you wrong sometimes
[54:36] but you know what
[54:37] when he stood back from that thing
[54:40] he saw
[54:42] what was in his mind
[54:44] before the foundation of the world
[54:46] that's what he's seeing now folks he's
[54:48] seeing the masterpiece
[54:50] again god has the perfect masterpiece
[54:53] not marred with
[54:55] put in whatever you want to
[54:57] ideas of man
[55:00] that's why i said you you see those
[55:02] sisters standing up here
[55:04] i'm gonna say it
[55:05] that's the perfect
[55:07] example of god
[55:09] that you can live that
[55:12] the perfect example of a bride without
[55:15] spot or wrinkle that god is going to
[55:17] present it he said to himself
[55:20] amen
[55:21] but we got to get there first but there
[55:23] had to be a beginning
[55:25] that had to be a time when they rolled
[55:27] that big stone into or set that big
[55:29] piece of stone in michelangelo's uh
[55:32] studio
[55:33] and i guess me and you walk by and we
[55:35] look at it and go
[55:37] what's that
[55:40] big old piece of rock
[55:43] right
[55:44] but what did michelangelo say
[55:46] he already saw the image inside there if
[55:48] not he would have knocked off the wrong
[55:50] piece at the wrong time he actually
[55:52] literally saw that image well you know
[55:54] what did god do
[55:55] before the foundation of the world
[55:58] he saw that image
[56:00] and he knew as a master builder he knew
[56:03] how to chip it away
[56:05] through 2 000 years of church ages he
[56:07] chipped away
[56:09] now he's come down time where he's what
[56:12] he's getting the eyes right he's getting
[56:14] the head right
[56:15] he's getting everything right before the
[56:17] detail because remember when
[56:18] michelangelo stood back and looked at it
[56:20] he saw that image and it was so real
[56:25] it was so real
[56:27] until he struck it on the knee and said
[56:29] speak
[56:31] that's what god's waiting on me and you
[56:34] to come to the place where you can step
[56:35] back and say speak cause i see myself i
[56:38] finally see me
[56:41] i don't see a world that's out here
[56:44] doing the things of the world i see
[56:45] myself
[56:48] i see the culmination of what i've been
[56:50] thinking about for
[56:52] six thousand years when he said let
[56:54] there be light
[56:57] you and i are the culmination of that
[56:59] there'll be no other bible
[57:01] there'll be no other church
[57:02] there'll be no other bride
[57:04] right
[57:05] everybody understand that
[57:07] this is it right this is the masterpiece
[57:11] perfect masterpiece
[57:13] again
[57:14] all right let's continue on let's go to
[57:16] psalms 85 9. i love that scripture dad
[57:18] read it like i said a long time ago
[57:20] surely his salvation is nigh them that
[57:22] fear him that glory may dwell in our
[57:23] land
[57:24] mercy and truth are met
[57:26] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[57:28] other
[57:29] in other words god and man has become
[57:31] one
[57:32] but i wanted to stop at this this
[57:34] morning but let's stop at it now because
[57:35] i want to bring something out a little
[57:37] bit more truth shall spring
[57:40] out
[57:42] of the earth
[57:43] not on the earth spring out
[57:46] of the earth what happens when god and
[57:48] man meets
[57:50] that's a perfect masterpiece
[57:52] and it's me and you that earth right
[57:55] there is you
[57:56] because when righteousness and peace
[57:58] kiss that's what came to being
[58:01] truth shall spring out of the earth and
[58:03] righteousness shall look down
[58:06] from heaven heaven is my throne god said
[58:08] and earth is my white footstool
[58:10] right
[58:11] statue of a perfect man
[58:16] spring out
[58:18] remember when when the sister shepherd's
[58:20] dream what came out of the top of that
[58:22] pyramid water
[58:24] bursting out flowing out
[58:27] getting out all the trash we'll get into
[58:28] that later on i want to get back into
[58:30] the statue of perfect man a little bit
[58:33] later on but not now everybody okay
[58:38] i hope this don't bore you
[58:41] number two god's gift always find their
[58:43] places and he was a being on earth a
[58:45] being of time which meant that he must
[58:47] have had a beginning therefore he
[58:49] created himself a body he's the only guy
[58:51] that can do that
[58:52] we can't create ourself a body to live
[58:54] in like i said you didn't have anything
[58:56] to do with you getting here
[58:58] nothing
[58:59] it was providence of god
[59:01] the foreknowledge of
[59:02] god but he could do it because he's a
[59:05] creator
[59:07] he created himself a body for himself
[59:09] that by this creation he might save the
[59:12] lost creation that he had created listen
[59:15] he didn't make us get lost he knew he
[59:17] would get lost if he put us in flesh he
[59:19] knew we would get lost
[59:21] therefore the attribute of savior could
[59:24] be displayed
[59:26] about all right
[59:29] look at number three how could god be
[59:31] created if he's a spirit
[59:35] how could he be he's eternal he never
[59:38] was created he never will be created
[59:39] because he was god at the beginning
[59:41] but he that is the beginning of the
[59:43] creation of god talking about revelation
[59:45] 3 14 was jesus christ when he was made
[59:48] manifest
[59:50] when he was made manifest
[59:53] in other words when he came on the earth
[59:55] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[59:56] pleased to dwell
[59:58] we aren't we've already been through all
[1:00:00] that we know what happened there in the
[1:00:01] river jordan and we know what happened
[1:00:02] then
[1:00:03] that when he went to uh
[1:00:05] when he went to the uh mountain
[1:00:08] and said this is my beloved son hear you
[1:00:10] him which is talking about adoption
[1:00:13] and i want to read this one quote they
[1:00:14] do not have this but i want to read this
[1:00:16] quote from adoption series 1960.
[1:00:19] i just
[1:00:20] thought about it back here says tell me
[1:00:22] my brother
[1:00:24] tell me my sister when was the time that
[1:00:26] the sons of god was ever to be
[1:00:28] manifested outside of this time now
[1:00:34] when were there ever was a time in
[1:00:35] history
[1:00:38] that manifests the time to deliver all
[1:00:40] nature
[1:00:44] nature the nature itself is groaning
[1:00:46] waiting for the time of manifestation
[1:00:47] talk about romans 8. why before the
[1:00:50] atonement was made before the holy ghost
[1:00:52] was ever poured out before even the old
[1:00:54] testament on down there couldn't have
[1:00:55] been manifestations it had to be this
[1:00:58] time
[1:01:01] now all things has been brought coming
[1:01:03] shaping up to a headstone and we'll get
[1:01:04] to that in just a second
[1:01:07] we'll get into shape in just a second to
[1:01:10] the manifestation of sons of god coming
[1:01:12] back and the spirit of god
[1:01:14] coming into those men so perfectly until
[1:01:17] their ministry will be so close to
[1:01:19] christ to join him in the church
[1:01:20] together
[1:01:22] join him in the church together amen so
[1:01:25] we'll get to that in just a second but
[1:01:26] let's go to psalms 118 verse 21 and
[1:01:28] that's where we kind of
[1:01:30] was tailing off this morning
[1:01:34] what is a stone
[1:01:36] what is a rock in the bible the rock is
[1:01:39] a symbol as chris was talking about this
[1:01:41] past weekend which that means what
[1:01:44] revelation right
[1:01:46] you look at a rock you think strength
[1:01:48] you think well this is this is you know
[1:01:50] this ain't gonna move that rock of
[1:01:52] gibraltar has never moved in in
[1:01:54] thousands of years you know you see that
[1:01:55] big rock on what is it prudential or
[1:01:57] somewhere you see that big rock
[1:01:59] and that's what i think of when psalms
[1:02:00] 118 verse 21 says i will praise thee for
[1:02:03] that who has heard me in art my
[1:02:04] salvation the stone
[1:02:07] which the builders refused
[1:02:10] now the stone is christ right
[1:02:12] because he's the head of all revelation
[1:02:14] he is he is the stone
[1:02:16] remember he's a stone that rolled out of
[1:02:17] babylon and broke the broke the iron in
[1:02:20] the clay and all the great image in
[1:02:21] daniel the stone which the builders
[1:02:24] refused
[1:02:26] who refused him the old testament
[1:02:28] refused him the new testament refused
[1:02:30] him denominations has refused him
[1:02:36] they've refused
[1:02:37] all
[1:02:39] they've refused some of it they'll take
[1:02:40] they'll take some but they won't take
[1:02:41] all of it
[1:02:43] the stone which the builders refuse is
[1:02:45] become the headstone of the corner that
[1:02:48] brother joe was showing me
[1:02:50] um something the brother had done and
[1:02:52] i'll bring it up next sunday or sunday
[1:02:54] after on the screen where it shows that
[1:02:57] the the same headstone here is down here
[1:02:59] all right
[1:03:01] but you got your corners because he had
[1:03:02] to become listen if they rejected him
[1:03:05] here he's going to have a church
[1:03:09] without spot or wrinkle he's going to
[1:03:10] have a bride that all these
[1:03:14] characteristics
[1:03:15] virtues are going to flow through them
[1:03:18] so it doesn't matter what man does they
[1:03:19] can start 20 million denominations
[1:03:22] god's going to have a church
[1:03:24] he's going to have a bride so what he
[1:03:26] done was he they rejected him well that
[1:03:28] just cut that off he just went down to
[1:03:29] the bottom and started on the day of
[1:03:31] pentecost down at the foundation
[1:03:34] and started building back up again
[1:03:37] he's going to have a church
[1:03:39] he's going to have a bride
[1:03:41] not 10 one right
[1:03:46] that's what i asked it
[1:03:48] i shouldn't have done it
[1:03:50] there's a new little baptist preacher
[1:03:52] there in town
[1:03:53] we were talking about something
[1:03:57] chris said something about something i
[1:03:59] said
[1:04:00] i said well let me ask you a question i
[1:04:01] said you're baptist
[1:04:03] he said yeah
[1:04:04] i said why don't you go to a methodist
[1:04:06] church
[1:04:09] he just kind of looked at me he said
[1:04:11] because i'm a baptist
[1:04:12] i said well what's the difference in you
[1:04:14] and the methodists i thought y'all all
[1:04:15] believed jesus christ was the son of god
[1:04:16] i thought you all believed in
[1:04:18] no we don't believe like they believe
[1:04:20] i said so you're telling me that they're
[1:04:21] all going to hell and you're going to
[1:04:22] heaven

[1:04:26] said well wait a minute
[1:04:28] you're saying they're wrong and you're
[1:04:29] right

[1:04:34] that because he's a good kid
[1:04:35] i let him off i didn't say any more
[1:04:37] about it but
[1:04:38] he had that deer in the headlight look i
[1:04:40] said well
[1:04:42] why are you believing this doctrine
[1:04:45] and you're believing it's this way
[1:04:46] because you don't believe this one and
[1:04:48] then y'all all going to go to heaven and
[1:04:50] what's going to happen
[1:04:52] we're going to have divisions in heaven
[1:04:54] i don't think so
[1:04:56] we're going to have one city
[1:04:58] we're going to have one earth
[1:05:01] there's going to be many heavens read
[1:05:02] your bible heavens and one earth there's
[1:05:06] not going to be a hundred earths you're
[1:05:07] gonna be one earth why because that's
[1:05:08] where you came from
[1:05:12] that's why he thought so much of you he
[1:05:14] put you in this earth right
[1:05:17] what a mighty god we serve
[1:05:19] ephesians two verse 19 says now
[1:05:20] therefore you are no more strangers than
[1:05:22] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:05:24] saints and of the household of god and
[1:05:26] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:05:28] apostles and prophets
[1:05:30] you believe in prophets yeah so do i
[1:05:33] jesus christ though being the chief
[1:05:35] cornerstone
[1:05:37] chief cornerstone
[1:05:39] start the building
[1:05:40] if you start the building right
[1:05:46] right
[1:05:47] you know brother gary built some pretty
[1:05:49] houses i've seen him build several
[1:05:50] things myself personally
[1:05:52] we started with a good foundation though
[1:05:54] i don't care how the building looks you
[1:05:56] put it on a shabby foundation
[1:05:58] it will fall
[1:06:00] it will crack
[1:06:01] i don't care how big you build it it
[1:06:03] will fall over look at the leaning tower
[1:06:05] pizza
[1:06:07] pizza not pizza
[1:06:09] what it was not built on a good
[1:06:11] foundation but you and i
[1:06:13] that's why the zerubbabel that's why you
[1:06:15] had all the different ones where you had
[1:06:17] to clean the foundation off because look
[1:06:19] the foundation was jesus christ so he
[1:06:21] didn't have to be remade
[1:06:24] you just had to clean that part off and
[1:06:26] start building the right building
[1:06:28] all right so let's look here
[1:06:30] in whom all the building
[1:06:32] fitly framed together
[1:06:36] groweth
[1:06:37] unto a holy temple of the lord that's
[1:06:39] where we're at this morning and where is
[1:06:40] that holy temple it's you
[1:06:43] and me
[1:06:45] start the building right
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] if you start right you'll end right
[1:06:51] amen and of all the buildings fitly
[1:06:54] framed together growth into a holy
[1:06:55] temple in the lord
[1:06:57] in whom ye also are building together
[1:06:59] for a habitation not just building the
[1:07:02] building to look at it
[1:07:04] he's not just wanting to look at you
[1:07:05] today
[1:07:07] he's wanting to dwell inside of you he's
[1:07:09] wanting to inhabit your building
[1:07:12] that's what it says right here in whom
[1:07:14] you also are building together for
[1:07:17] inhabitation of god
[1:07:20] through the spirit
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:25] all right let's start here with
[1:07:27] first peter to go to second peter and
[1:07:28] then we'll get to something
[1:07:32] skip a little bit of this
[1:07:40] oh i didn't read this quote a minute ago
[1:07:42] i'll read it in a minute
[1:07:44] ye also as lively stones
[1:07:49] some of you right now are not very
[1:07:51] lively
[1:07:55] harrison
[1:07:57] he's good
[1:07:59] he also has lively stones
[1:08:02] or built up a spiritual house
[1:08:05] a holy priesthood
[1:08:07] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:08:10] how are you going to do it if you don't
[1:08:12] know the word of god
[1:08:13] you got to be taught right
[1:08:16] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:08:18] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:08:20] scripture behold i land zion a chief
[1:08:23] cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:08:26] believeth on him shall not be what
[1:08:28] confounded
[1:08:35] confusion
[1:08:36] that's what the world loves
[1:08:39] but listen we should not be confused
[1:08:45] folks listen we should not be confused
[1:08:49] we might not understand some things but
[1:08:51] to be confused means not knowing where
[1:08:53] you're going or where you came from
[1:08:55] now well you better know where you come
[1:08:57] from and where you're going at least you
[1:08:59] should know that
[1:09:00] shall not be confounded
[1:09:03] promise
[1:09:04] put this in the bible this is my promise
[1:09:06] he that believeth on him shall not be
[1:09:08] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:09:11] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:09:13] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:09:16] builders disallowed in other words they
[1:09:18] did away with a headstone
[1:09:21] the same has made the head of the corner
[1:09:22] in other words he is still by all these
[1:09:25] scriptures he is going down to the
[1:09:26] foundation and he is going to build a
[1:09:28] church
[1:09:29] it's not going to be off level it's
[1:09:31] going to be exactly perfectly level
[1:09:32] right
[1:09:34] and a stone of stumbling
[1:09:36] and a rock of offense
[1:09:38] even to them with stumble what
[1:09:40] at the word
[1:09:42] raise that up a little bit if you don't
[1:09:44] mind
[1:09:45] so we can all read it there
[1:09:47] what stumble at the word
[1:09:50] being disobedient what knowing when the
[1:09:53] bible tells you what to do and you don't
[1:09:55] do it
[1:09:56] that's disobedience
[1:10:00] amen being disobedient whereunto also
[1:10:04] they were appointed there are some
[1:10:06] people going to be appointed to that
[1:10:08] they're just going to manifest that and
[1:10:10] sorry they just chose it that way
[1:10:13] everybody all right

[1:10:21] down to
[1:10:22] where we're at that's all right we'll
[1:10:26] not be too long

[1:10:34] people to christ we're getting them to a
[1:10:36] church
[1:10:37] or to a theory

[1:10:44] only one the only one that has life he
[1:10:47] that has the son has life and if the
[1:10:49] life of a man that's dead be projected

[1:11:20] let somebody teach us
[1:11:22] and we've had a good teacher still have
[1:11:24] a good teacher
[1:11:27] no excuse there then mark that one off
[1:11:31] if you have an excuse that's not one of
[1:11:32] them mark that went off
[1:11:35] i slept in church while he was teaching
[1:11:37] keep that one because you don't need to
[1:11:38] mark that one off but look we're getting
[1:11:40] people are we getting people to christ
[1:11:42] and that's what i'm telling you the son
[1:11:43] of man that's who christ is

[1:12:23] peter one verse three
[1:12:24] is right after first peter two verse
[1:12:26] five which is almost at the very end
[1:12:29] there you go according as his divine now
[1:12:31] this is second peter this is peter the
[1:12:33] naked fisherman
[1:12:38] that can't write his name i wonder who
[1:12:40] wrote that for him
[1:12:42] can't write his name ignorant unlearned
[1:12:45] it's what the bible said
[1:12:47] i'm talking about bible
[1:12:49] peter was naked
[1:12:51] on the boat fishing and you know they're
[1:12:53] pretty rough
[1:12:55] fishermen have a pretty
[1:12:56] yeah they're rough
[1:13:00] so what better a man
[1:13:02] they got turned around on their
[1:13:04] pentecost by the word of god
[1:13:06] that wanted to that wanted to fight
[1:13:08] physically and cut people's ears off and
[1:13:10] stab them and shoot them and whatever
[1:13:12] lord will not let you go
[1:13:16] he said peter before
[1:13:19] the crows this morning in other
[1:13:20] words before the morning before the sun
[1:13:22] comes up you're going to deny me three
[1:13:24] times three times you're gonna deny you
[1:13:26] even knew who i was
[1:13:29] and i bet peter inside was like
[1:13:31] yeah yeah right
[1:13:32] i'll cut another ear off if i can but
[1:13:35] buddy when they hauled him off the
[1:13:36] pilot's hall where'd he go
[1:13:39] he you can see him over there in the
[1:13:41] corner
[1:13:42] around the fire
[1:13:43] you know kind of hunkered down and that
[1:13:45] you know this man nope don't know him
[1:13:46] you know this man i know you talk just
[1:13:48] like nope don't know him and in the
[1:13:50] third person he got a little righteous
[1:13:51] indignation he didn't have a whole lot
[1:13:53] of tempers or patience
[1:13:54] at that moment because he started
[1:13:56] cursing
[1:13:57] i don't know this person but listen when
[1:13:59] he got born again amen he wrote this
[1:14:03] according as his divine power has given
[1:14:05] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:14:07] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:14:09] of him that have called us to glory and
[1:14:10] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:14:12] exceeding i'll read this whole chapter
[1:14:14] there's all kind of i guess is that
[1:14:16] adjectives
[1:14:18] you know is that
[1:14:20] that'd be
[1:14:21] exceeding precious
[1:14:23] and all these
[1:14:24] all these things that is adjectives that
[1:14:26] describe something way above what it's
[1:14:28] supposed to be
[1:14:29] whereby are given unto us exceeding not
[1:14:32] just great it could have read like this
[1:14:33] whereby are given unto us great promises
[1:14:36] that don't sound very good i mean it
[1:14:37] sounds okay
[1:14:38] but when you say whereby are giving us
[1:14:40] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:14:44] that by these promises in other words
[1:14:47] you might be partakers
[1:14:51] partakers not lookers
[1:14:55] not window dressers
[1:14:57] but partakers of the divine nature of
[1:14:59] god
[1:15:01] divine nature
[1:15:03] that's why you must have the new birth
[1:15:05] before you can get these virtues you do
[1:15:07] not know how to get them you do not know
[1:15:09] what they are
[1:15:12] you might be protectors of the divine
[1:15:13] nature having what escape the corruption
[1:15:17] that is in the world through lust
[1:15:19] now look that was a wonderful
[1:15:21] dissertation
[1:15:22] peter is setting you up he's saying
[1:15:24] divine power according to divine power
[1:15:26] has given unto who us
[1:15:28] all things pertain to life and
[1:15:30] governments through the knowledge of him
[1:15:31] that have called us to glory in virtue
[1:15:33] he's talking about us
[1:15:35] all right whereby are given unto
[1:15:38] us
[1:15:39] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:15:41] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:15:44] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:15:46] corruption that is in the world through
[1:15:47] lust all right
[1:15:49] okay
[1:15:53] peter said oh wait a minute and besides
[1:15:55] this
[1:15:57] and besides what i just told you you got
[1:15:58] to get the new birth you got to get the
[1:16:01] you got to get the
[1:16:02] uh the divine nature of god and beside
[1:16:06] this
[1:16:08] giving all there's another one giving
[1:16:10] all diligence
[1:16:12] add to your faith your new birth
[1:16:16] virtue
[1:16:18] and to your virtue
[1:16:20] add knowledge
[1:16:21] and the knowledge add temperance into
[1:16:23] temperance add patience
[1:16:25] i believe when peter was writing this
[1:16:27] there was probably some tears running
[1:16:28] out of his eyes
[1:16:30] he's going man i used to not have any of
[1:16:32] them
[1:16:34] and to temperance patience and to
[1:16:36] patience godliness and to godliness
[1:16:39] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:16:41] kindness charity he didn't finish there
[1:16:44] watch
[1:16:45] scroll up
[1:16:50] for if these things these virtues be in
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:55] and look there's an abound
[1:16:58] heaping over
[1:17:02] full saucers running over
[1:17:06] they make you
[1:17:09] that will make you jesus christ if
[1:17:10] you'll let it right oh i can't be yeah
[1:17:13] you can
[1:17:16] because the perfect one's inside you
[1:17:18] be there for perfect
[1:17:20] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:17:23] so wait a minute
[1:17:24] wait a minute hold on
[1:17:26] so where'd jesus get all these virtues
[1:17:27] out
[1:17:32] from the father
[1:17:35] the creator the one that never sinned
[1:17:37] the one that never had a problem one
[1:17:38] that never did any of those things wrong
[1:17:41] the divine nature of god was in jesus
[1:17:44] christ
[1:17:45] not another person same person but like
[1:17:48] i said this morning he let him develop
[1:17:50] out through his flesh so that he can
[1:17:52] display him so that we can read matthew
[1:17:54] mark luke and john and get this whole
[1:17:56] statue of a perfect man
[1:17:58] in just four four matthew martin luke
[1:18:01] and john that's the divine nature of god
[1:18:04] is that okay
[1:18:06] can you say amen then
[1:18:08] okay
[1:18:10] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:18:12] what barren
[1:18:14] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:18:16] lord jesus christ listen that's why
[1:18:17] these virtues are a requirement in this
[1:18:19] age
[1:18:22] who wants to be barren
[1:18:24] who wants to be unfruitful
[1:18:27] i thought we were lively stones
[1:18:31] but look
[1:18:33] but he that lacketh these things
[1:18:35] is blind
[1:18:38] and cannot see or understand
[1:18:41] afar off
[1:18:43] and look and hath forgotten
[1:18:48] has forgotten that he was purged from
[1:18:50] his old sin
[1:18:53] wow
[1:18:55] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:18:57] there's that word again diligence
[1:18:59] to make your calling in election sure
[1:19:01] for if you do these things
[1:19:03] what a promise
[1:19:06] look at that you shall never
[1:19:10] fall
[1:19:12] did jesus fall
[1:19:14] no
[1:19:15] if you take that divine nature and you
[1:19:17] put it in you guess what you're not
[1:19:19] gonna fall either
[1:19:20] oh you're gonna have problems
[1:19:22] but you're not gonna fall
[1:19:24] you know why because you're a mature
[1:19:25] christian you know how to handle things
[1:19:27] you don't let little things bother you
[1:19:28] anymore
[1:19:29] just saying
[1:19:32] remember some of this
[1:19:38] but if you'll grow
[1:19:40] you'll never fall
[1:19:42] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:19:44] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:19:46] kingdom look an entrance shall be
[1:19:49] ministered unto you
[1:19:51] abundantly look at this whole scripture
[1:19:53] whole i mean he used some wonderful
[1:19:55] adjectives
[1:19:57] we hear a lot of bad ones out in the
[1:19:59] world so we can get some good ones here
[1:20:00] if you don't mind
[1:20:01] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[1:20:03] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:20:06] wherefore look
[1:20:07] i will not be negligent to put you
[1:20:10] always in remembrance of these things
[1:20:11] what these things
[1:20:13] that's why we preach in this church
[1:20:14] actively preach the status of a perfect
[1:20:16] man over and over again
[1:20:19] i will
[1:20:20] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:20:22] remembrance of these things what these
[1:20:24] virtues
[1:20:26] though you know them and be established
[1:20:29] in the present day truth
[1:20:32] present day truth
[1:20:34] today is the present day truth
[1:20:38] now i'm not going to get into the verses
[1:20:39] but i want to read something
[1:20:43] i'll show you a little something i
[1:20:44] believe it'll help us
[1:20:47] because remember
[1:20:48] the head and the body
[1:20:51] spiritually has been separated
[1:20:54] everybody okay with that
[1:20:56] the body came back on the day of
[1:20:58] pentecost and it's been building the
[1:20:59] body the head's here
[1:21:00] the head's jesus christ in the seventh
[1:21:02] dimension with a glorified body the son
[1:21:05] of man everybody okay
[1:21:07] all right
[1:21:08] so it's not complete yet but there's got
[1:21:11] to come a time where it's got to be back
[1:21:13] together again
[1:21:14] everybody got that
[1:21:16] amen that's our commission
[1:21:19] colossians 1 verse 18 says he is the
[1:21:21] head of the body we read it i'm going to
[1:21:22] read it again the church who is the
[1:21:24] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:21:25] that in all things he might have the
[1:21:27] preeminence
[1:21:28] if you let these virtues work in your
[1:21:30] life you will have the preeminence i
[1:21:31] believe
[1:21:33] please the father that in him should all
[1:21:34] fullness dwell now
[1:21:36] i was looking the other day
[1:21:38] and i know brother branham
[1:21:40] he brings us a in the statue of perfect
[1:21:42] man he starts talking about
[1:21:44] um
[1:21:46] certain things about the shape of
[1:21:48] pyramids
[1:21:49] and we know what a pyramid is it's just
[1:21:51] like that
[1:21:53] that's a pyramid right and it's
[1:21:54] three-sided right not four-sided it's
[1:21:56] three-sided
[1:21:58] that right
[1:21:59] try
[1:22:01] all right
[1:22:03] now watch
[1:22:06] let's read this last quote
[1:22:11] then questions and answers 1964. the
[1:22:14] question was
[1:22:15] are you the son of man
[1:22:18] i didn't put that on there because he
[1:22:19] brings a bunch before that it's not
[1:22:22] pertinent to what i wanted you to see so
[1:22:24] i cut it short for time
[1:22:26] because he said i am not he they said
[1:22:28] brother adam are you the son of man
[1:22:30] he says no
[1:22:32] definitely not
[1:22:34] i was born in sin in other words
[1:22:36] the son of the son of man was not
[1:22:39] so i am not he i am his servant
[1:22:43] and the pillar of fire is not he
[1:22:47] and morphy
[1:22:48] we know it is but it's not what he's
[1:22:50] talking about
[1:22:53] it's in spirit form see
[1:22:56] which was upon the son of man
[1:23:02] remember
[1:23:03] on the river jordan there was an
[1:23:04] anointing came on jesus
[1:23:06] and then brother brown said in the
[1:23:07] garden of gethsemane that anointing left
[1:23:09] him
[1:23:11] the ministry left him so he could die is
[1:23:13] that right
[1:23:14] it's in spirit form which was upon the
[1:23:17] son of man and has come now to anoint
[1:23:20] sons of men
[1:23:23] to bring back what
[1:23:25] a ministry just exactly like he said it
[1:23:28] would be
[1:23:30] look in order for the head and the rest
[1:23:32] of the body watch to connect together
[1:23:38] listen if you take this cap that i've
[1:23:40] got in my hand you can't see it but
[1:23:43] you really can't see it now
[1:23:46] if i take and put this right here on
[1:23:48] there like that what happened what
[1:23:49] happened
[1:23:52] slides off gets knocked off
[1:23:54] if it's just completely straight across
[1:23:59] but if some way you can get it to stay
[1:24:05] let's pay attention for just a second
[1:24:06] everybody wake up this will be it right
[1:24:08] here we'll be done
[1:24:10] this is just something i want you to
[1:24:11] chew on
[1:24:13] but watch connect together there's no
[1:24:16] good for the head to be here in the body
[1:24:18] to be here
[1:24:19] there's got to be a connection
[1:24:21] there's got to be an invisible union
[1:24:24] there's got to be bride
[1:24:26] and bridegroom
[1:24:28] connecting all right so that what so
[1:24:30] that when you he moves you move
[1:24:34] all right everybody all right
[1:24:36] now watch
[1:24:38] just like the pyramid as enoch built
[1:24:41] and we find that in that pyramid
[1:24:44] they never did get the headstone on it
[1:24:47] why the headstones yet to come in other
[1:24:50] words all the pyramids in egypt have a
[1:24:52] flat piece just like this on it this is
[1:24:54] not on the pyramid in egypt
[1:24:57] go look at it it doesn't ever come to a
[1:24:59] point it's got a flat piece on top
[1:25:02] showing enough showing in the behind the
[1:25:04] bible of that time remember brother
[1:25:06] brown said that was what the second
[1:25:08] bible
[1:25:09] the headstones yet to come the seven
[1:25:11] steps in the pyramid we'll go through
[1:25:13] that someday i'd just like to show you
[1:25:15] how it really is perfectly with the
[1:25:16] scripture
[1:25:18] and now if you notice on your american
[1:25:20] dollar bill
[1:25:22] if you got a dollar bill you can look at
[1:25:23] it
[1:25:24] turn it over on the back that great
[1:25:26] headstone and i says the great seal
[1:25:29] it will come
[1:25:31] and notice these stones
[1:25:33] was anybody ever here at the pyramids in
[1:25:35] egypt well if you notice
[1:25:37] then there's hands that went up that had
[1:25:39] been there all right
[1:25:40] these stones are laying in there so
[1:25:42] perfect that
[1:25:43] and that top where the coppola like in
[1:25:46] the top what's a coppola it's like a cap
[1:25:48] where the coppola locking the top of it
[1:25:50] look when that stone comes what's this
[1:25:54] it'll be like a great diamond fitting
[1:25:55] right down in
[1:25:58] everybody got that
[1:26:00] now
[1:26:01] what's the shape of a diamond
[1:26:06] that's not the shape of a diamond
[1:26:12] that's a diamond
[1:26:18] that's the way it's going to fit
[1:26:20] it's going to go down in
[1:26:22] can't move
[1:26:24] can't slide watch
[1:26:26] when that stone comes it'll be like a
[1:26:28] great diamond
[1:26:29] fitting right down in there just perfect
[1:26:32] with it
[1:26:33] now that stone would not fit down at the
[1:26:35] bottom foundation
[1:26:38] that stone feel like that's not going to
[1:26:39] fit on the bottom
[1:26:41] right that's what he's saying apart
[1:26:43] watch
[1:26:44] neither will it fit on the second
[1:26:46] foundation or the third it'll only fit
[1:26:49] on the top when the entire building has
[1:26:51] become fitted to that stone
[1:26:59] bridegroom
[1:27:00] bride
[1:27:03] fit in
[1:27:04] he comes down in and you can't shake it
[1:27:06] off brother brown talks of a flange
[1:27:09] in the statue of a perfect man to shed
[1:27:11] water
[1:27:15] the bride and bridegroom uniting
[1:27:19] uniting together
[1:27:22] consummating the marriage
[1:27:25] he's the head of it all
[1:27:26] right and he's wanting to not be with us
[1:27:30] not be beside us he wants to be in us
[1:27:33] because if he's not inside of us he
[1:27:35] can't work
[1:27:36] now watch it'll only fit on the top
[1:27:38] foundation when the entire building has
[1:27:40] become fitted to the stone
[1:27:43] and jesus cannot come until the church a
[1:27:45] body of believers and the ministry that
[1:27:48] he wants will have to be the same
[1:27:51] listen as it was then and that brings
[1:27:54] them without us is not made perfect paul
[1:27:56] said hebrews 11 without us they cannot
[1:27:59] be perfected they must have this
[1:28:01] ministry to raise up the lutherans
[1:28:03] westlands and all them down through the
[1:28:06] ages
[1:28:07] a ministry a diamond
[1:28:10] and you read brother brown talks about a
[1:28:11] diamond many many many times
[1:28:13] how it reflects light
[1:28:15] and it's got all these different colors
[1:28:17] but if you look he didn't say
[1:28:20] pyramid shape he said diamond
[1:28:23] diamond shape now that's not on it's not
[1:28:25] on here and he didn't draw it i'm just
[1:28:26] telling you that's what i see
[1:28:29] because we must unite
[1:28:31] not just sit on top
[1:28:33] we must unite and be together
[1:28:35] amen a union a spiritual union an
[1:28:37] invisible union nobody's gonna know this
[1:28:41] the world's not they're going to look at
[1:28:42] us cross-eyed
[1:28:45] they do anyway when your sisters walk
[1:28:46] down the street you go what do you mean
[1:28:48] you don't wear pants
[1:28:52] why is your hair so long
[1:28:55] boy you know what how many times my
[1:28:57] somebody told my wife not too long ago
[1:28:59] there was a guy saw her that we know
[1:29:01] roger corn he's been here before he said
[1:29:04] i just love to see
[1:29:06] godly women
[1:29:10] you know with long hair and address he
[1:29:11] said i love to see godly women
[1:29:15] you know i tell you
[1:29:18] look at what the world tells us
[1:29:21] the world tells us we should look at
[1:29:22] somebody
[1:29:24] that's all painted up
[1:29:27] and made up
[1:29:30] whatever happened to natural beauty
[1:29:34] those three girls
[1:29:37] natural beauty
[1:29:39] godly beauty
[1:29:40] something i'm not ashamed of
[1:29:43] but now they some that i've seen i'd be
[1:29:45] ashamed of
[1:29:46] all tatted up and got earrings and those
[1:29:49] rings and eye rings and
[1:29:51] tongue rings and
[1:29:54] but you see how the world's i'm sorry
[1:29:56] you see how the world sees that though
[1:29:57] that's common
[1:29:59] that's normal
[1:30:00] that's okay
[1:30:02] no it's not
[1:30:04] the bible tells you not to ink your body
[1:30:08] not punch holes all in yourself
[1:30:12] just go in there okay
[1:30:14] sorry
[1:30:16] but we've got to be
[1:30:18] different you cannot make yourself
[1:30:21] different
[1:30:22] god has to make you different
[1:30:25] i mean when we were growing up going to
[1:30:27] school now joyce is not included in that
[1:30:29] because she's a lot older
[1:30:33] right then
[1:30:34] yeah you're not saying a word are you
[1:30:37] he's not he just look he's not saying
[1:30:39] nothing i'm not gonna say anything
[1:30:42] but we had sister we had girls in the
[1:30:44] church
[1:30:45] that they go to school
[1:30:48] and they'd have their britches pants
[1:30:51] in their locker room
[1:30:54] and they'd put them on when they got to
[1:30:55] school because they didn't want to get
[1:30:57] talked about now joyce fountain i've
[1:30:59] been with her ever since we've been kids
[1:31:01] and that's not happened with her
[1:31:03] but it has happened
[1:31:05] that's not right folks that's living a
[1:31:06] lie
[1:31:08] but you know what you get born again
[1:31:11] that's why we teaching you birth the way
[1:31:12] we do you get born again
[1:31:14] a born-again believer won't do that
[1:31:17] we'll never do that
[1:31:19] because you know what you're contrary to
[1:31:20] the bible
[1:31:21] you're not contrary to what this man
[1:31:23] said on a tape or what this man said 50
[1:31:25] years ago or what the man said today
[1:31:27] behind the pulpit it's what the bible
[1:31:29] says
[1:31:31] modesty
[1:31:33] not be
[1:31:35] connected to the world we listen we're
[1:31:37] connected enough
[1:31:39] to the world
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:43] enough to where i'm about sick of it
[1:31:46] if you don't get sick of it you've got a
[1:31:47] problem
[1:31:50] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:31:53] but you're not gonna see that when you
[1:31:54] get to heaven
[1:31:56] you're not gonna see tatted up people
[1:31:57] and
[1:31:58] screws in their nose and all that other
[1:32:00] stuff no you're not going to see that
[1:32:02] if listen if you see it here
[1:32:04] you're going to see it there because
[1:32:06] what you are here is exactly what you're
[1:32:07] going to be there and there if that's
[1:32:09] not included in there you're not going
[1:32:11] to be the there that we're talking about
[1:32:13] you're going to be in another there
[1:32:14] which is
[1:32:16] the reasons of the lost
[1:32:18] not trying to scare you but i'm telling
[1:32:19] you
[1:32:20] the son of man came
[1:32:22] to live what the bible said
[1:32:26] he lived it to a t
[1:32:28] now that same person
[1:32:31] came down through the church ages and
[1:32:32] look he winked at the ignorance of man
[1:32:36] well you know he did because luther was
[1:32:38] a trinitarian yet he saved him
[1:32:42] okay but it wasn't time
[1:32:44] it wasn't time for the head and the body
[1:32:46] to meet it was time to building the body
[1:32:49] but not a time to put the top on it
[1:32:51] to make a complete unit
[1:32:54] you come into our age you've got
[1:32:56] almost built to the very top and then
[1:32:58] you've got a head that's got to unite
[1:33:00] with it
[1:33:01] and when they're hitting the body unite
[1:33:03] brother brown said then that's when
[1:33:04] we're going to go in a rapture
[1:33:07] let's stand our feet you're going to go
[1:33:09] in the rapture when the head and body
[1:33:10] unites
[1:33:12] and the same ministry see you can't have
[1:33:14] the same ministry in 12 or 13 000
[1:33:17] different ways of seeing jesus christ
[1:33:22] there's only one right
[1:33:24] and he's not going to accept anything
[1:33:26] different
[1:33:32] but all that live godly in christ shall
[1:33:34] what suffer
[1:33:36] persecution
[1:33:37] don't think it's going to be
[1:33:39] a piece of cake
[1:33:41] it's not
[1:33:43] but y'all the prettiest girls and boys
[1:33:44] i'm not boys they're not pretty they're
[1:33:46] handsome
[1:33:47] some of the handsomest prettiest people
[1:33:49] that i've ever seen is our as our young
[1:33:51] adults amen
[1:33:53] [Applause]
[1:33:55] and if you're doing it just because your
[1:33:56] parents told you to do it you're doing
[1:33:58] it wrong
[1:33:59] all right
[1:34:00] you need to do it for god
[1:34:03] you need to do it for the lord you know
[1:34:04] what james always told her her parents
[1:34:07] said why do you not why do you do the
[1:34:08] things why you just look so you know you
[1:34:10] look so um was plain
[1:34:13] looked plain so
[1:34:15] okay that's all right plane's good to me
[1:34:18] you know what i can wake up and look at
[1:34:19] the same woman i look at at four o'clock
[1:34:21] in the afternoon
[1:34:23] the world can't say that
[1:34:26] you know what i mean
[1:34:28] okay so
[1:34:30] to me that's plain and that's fine
[1:34:33] but she said if if jesus christ can hang
[1:34:35] on a cross for three hours
[1:34:36] with nails in his hands
[1:34:38] beat like hamburger meat crown of thorns
[1:34:40] pushed on his head a spear in his side
[1:34:44] beat with stripes on his back
[1:34:47] i can deal with this long hair
[1:34:50] because god said it was your glory
[1:34:53] and if you cut it it's an abomination to
[1:34:55] god amen i'm just telling you what the
[1:34:57] bible said i'm just telling that's what
[1:34:59] i'm telling you what the bible said
[1:35:00] that's why
[1:35:02] it's refreshing
[1:35:04] to see
[1:35:06] young adults and i mean your sisters too
[1:35:08] but young adults seeing young adults
[1:35:09] that's so influenced by the internet and
[1:35:12] by this one saying this and social media
[1:35:14] is saying well you got to do it this way
[1:35:17] or you got to do it this way
[1:35:19] to be cool
[1:35:22] listen
[1:35:24] the only time you going to be cool
[1:35:27] is on this earth
[1:35:29] when you go to that other place
[1:35:32] and you've turned god down
[1:35:33] you'll never be cool
[1:35:37] you're going to be tormented
[1:35:39] for a long period of time i'm sorry god
[1:35:41] bless you
[1:35:42] but listen the head and the head and the
[1:35:44] body must unite
[1:35:46] we've got to have that headstone back
[1:35:48] and we've got to unite that thing
[1:35:50] together
[1:35:51] with an open book we can do that
[1:35:53] let's sing a song god bless you we love
[1:35:55] you with the love of the lord
