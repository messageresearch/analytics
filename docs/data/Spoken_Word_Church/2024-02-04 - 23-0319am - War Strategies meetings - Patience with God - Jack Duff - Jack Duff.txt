telling him also where some of y'all were were sent here by their families to get away from the message and got plopped down right beside somebody that was in the message God's going to get you one

um your your pastor brother Dell amen his his his ministry has just had a tremendous impact and I was talking to him yesterday he said you think 50 years is enough and uh just the the time that he has um given to serving the bride of Christ not just here in Lula uh but your ministry has impacted people all over the world and uh and we're very grateful for that and I met um you know brother Wade number of years to go and just really appreciate uh the connection that we made there and I was just so happy to hear uh about the opportunity to come and being fellowship and uh and I'm I'm glad we were able to make it happen this weekend I actually thought I had a another place that I was supposed to be when he when he reached out to me and then I called and he tried to confirm and said no I forgot to tell you brother Jack we got somebody else that weekend okay no problem that I know where I'm supposed to be that weekend amen so I'm I'm I'm here and by by by the plan of God and uh you know we're happy so uh my my my wife is with me uh sister Erica and uh my my youngest daughter uh Sister Sarah and um a couple things that I I I know I'm on a limited time schedule uh this morning but I did promise brother Wade I will return amen now uh unfortunately this year is a really really tight year I got a lot of things happening uh this year and you know personal things as well as Ministry things but um you know and and trying to trying to put all that together and you know one of other big things somebody ask me just to share is that we are we're in the process of uh negotiating on on a new church and um you know we we've run into uh just a little roadblock but we believe God can uh help us overcome that and uh you know and and you know we we actually had a contract signed and once we start doing our due diligence we found some things that didn't necessarily uh line up they didn't tell us everything so we we pulled out and we resubmitted a new contract at a lower price and uh you know and they're saying no we don't want to accept that price but you know we think it's a fair price based on the information that we we we had and uh even last night I left here and I saw that had updated their listing they've actually lowered the listing price uh on this and uh I'm like you all are getting closer to where we want to be so so I'm just waiting on the Lord right and uh I mean we kind of reached a spot where only God can kind of step in at this point in time and uh and and I I'm reminded of scripture says that he he looks for opportunities uh to come on behalf of his people right so this is an opportunity for him to do that so we uh just keep us in prayer we we we ask that you you you would do that for us um and someone asks was I related to sister Brenda Lewis yes sister Brenda Lewis is my aunt and uh she and my mom there were nine kids and uh and out of the nine kids she was one one year older than my mom my mom is Sister Ellen bur and um uh uh but you know they were they were the only two out of the nine kids that came into the message so um um you know amen it is what it is so but uh but yes Sister Sister Lewis is my aunt and uh and very very grateful it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promises it's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around going to take a strong long wind than this cuz my feet are on Solid Ground and she wrote another song says it's already done it's already done the victory is won the battle is over it's already done when your confession of faith is wavering yeah and doubt is bombarding your mind just speak it is written just like Jesus said the angel of the Lord is right on time cuz it's already done I say that to the new church it's already done the victory is is one the battle is over it's already done hallelujah and we used to say I know that it's done oh Hallelujah we we we we've we we we thank the Lord for her she she passed away on um I know I can't remember the year but I know the date October 7th and um we were um when we looked looked at that cuz God is founding everything and October is the 10th month and on the seventh day and she believed Revelation 10:7 so we thank God for her um somebody asked me to share my testimony and I I I would have to say this my testimony is a sermon by itself and uh I would love to do it you know cuz here's here's the thing that I found out is that it's best for you to share your own testimony other wise the devil will try to give you one yeah that's right come on now with all the stuff that people say this and that they'll give you their your own personal testimony but when you share what happened to you yeah right then nobody can take that from you absolutely amen I want my daughter to come um she is going to sing and she had a little song in her heart that I think would be a a blessing amen amen so this is my daughter Sister Sarah amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] am and keep you make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the Lord turn his face for you and give you peace the Lord Lord bless you and keep you make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the Lord turn his face for

[Music] aen amen I certainly thank uh my daughter for for that blessing amen that's actually the title of the song The Blessing so uh we like to leave that with you thank you musicians uh it's a wonderful wonderful band amen God bless you all amen amen um we were we had a wonderful time on yesterday with the with the um youth service and um towards the end of the service uh brother Wade made a a comment about something that you all have been doing uh in regards to the um um the statue of a perfect man I believe he said that you all were they were been teaching on that so when I heard that I said you know know um I think I got something in my my notebook uh that would kind of go right along with with uh with that so I wanted to just kind of bring a little thought this morning that would just kind of connect with what was already being taught here uh brother um um brother Wade challenged me says try to choke us and I knew right there no not me I ain't going down that road not not in this Church no there some fine teaching that comes forth from this ministry so so all all I come to do is just put my shoulder to the wheel amen and uh amen we thank the Lord for all things so um I know that you all are familiar with um most of these scriptures but um there will be a slight uh slant on you know what we will bring to you today um so let's let's stand let's read a couple um scriptures few years ago we're going to go to Second Peter chapter 1 just read from there first and then um then I'll I'll go into Joshua 5 but a few years ago I I did a a series of sermons on the um uh on the uh the statue of a perfect man but I took it from an angle of um finding different Wars that were uh in the scripture in the Old Testament where the virtue would have been represented in that war and uh so I I I titled it war strategies right and I used the Seven Virtues as a strategy so we started with faith and went all the way up through uh you know charity and we just found different places in the Bible where that virtue would have been expressed in that war it was a war strategy all right so uh just just you know we'll we'll pick out one of those things today and use it amen we're going to use patience today all right so here uh in the scripture uh 2 Peter 1:3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly and and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they have to stay they make you that ye should neither be bearing nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lackthe things is blind mind and cannot see a far off and ha forgotten that he was purged from his old sins amen and it's just amazing to me that the man that actually took the ear off of a soldier that was coming to take Jesus is the man that's writing to us these things it shows you what the power transformation can do uh in a life amen praise the Lord uh let's go back over here to the Book of Joshua uh chapter 5 and we will just catch a a a verse there uh a couple verses starting at verse 13 Joshua chapter 5 uh it says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the uh to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant uh and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so amen let's pray father we thank you for the ability to uh read the word of God but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to uh bring Clarity to what it is that we've read take control over this portion of the service thank you for all that has been done thus far the worship the testimony uh God the specials everything that's been done uh that's been done Lord and and we can feel your presence here we know that you're are welcome in this place God speak to us through your word and and may Hearts be transformed and changed by the power of the spoken word it's in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you can be seated amen um and again I bring greetings from our church there uh in West Palm Beach Florida um spirit and Truth Tabernacle is our is our church and um my you know we um and we don't experience weather like this uh down where we're from amen it it this might be the coldest day in in January and we get only a few hours of that then the sun comes up and it's all going away uh so uh when we saw 20-some degrees said my goodness uh but you know nonetheless we're happy to be here amen so uh this morning I want to just take for a a title uh war strategies patience with God Amen patience with God when you go through the um uh the the statute of a perfect man brother Brandon when he gets to dealing with patience uh he uh he actually talks about two different um types of patience he says we need to have patience with God and then and he says we need to have patience with one another right so uh so that you know and when I preached this at home I actually took it uh I went went both directions I went one with patience with with one another and then one patience with God so I want to just bring that that that portion of it patience with God and as I mentioned we find different strategies amen where where these virtues might have been um manifested in certain uh uh Wars that happen in in the scripture certain B that happen and uh just uh just uh uh uh you know just to get us started here uh when we started out with faith being the foundation the the the the war that I I looked at in scripture was uh with what happened with Gideon all right and there's a there's a number of things uh you know that we can we can look in the scripture David and Goliath I think David certainly stepped out on faith uh before he went out and fought Goliath I mean a little little itty bitt bitty fellow getting ready to fight a giant Faith was manifested in David when he went out but Gideon's Army also we saw Faith manifested there uh and you know when when you just look at the numbers Gideon started out uh in a in a battle with 32,000 um Warriors that he was going to fight with but it was going to be 135,000 midianites that were going to go against 32,000 Israelites now when you look at that the odds when you have 135,000 midianites versus 32,000 M uh Israelites uh the odds were four sold to one right now God tells uh Gideon he says look if if there's anyone that's afraid and really doesn't want to go to go to battle just make an announcement and see who all's afraid and let just let let them go back because we don't need them to go out to the battlefield and and and to and to display that fear out on the battlefield so he says just let them go right now and uh and so when Gideon made the announcement he saw 22,000 men walk away and now he's down to 10,000 soldiers right and now the arms have just increased we have 13.5 I got to fight 13.5 men in order to overcome in this in this this battle right and uh and here you know it's 13.5 to one soldier in Israel and so God does another thing says now uh let them go down to the water and and those that lap like dogs put them to this side and those that prostrate themselves put them to another side and when he gets down there he sees that those that lap like dogs they were 300 it says that's the group that I want to go with now the odds are 450 soldiers to one It Takes Faith to go out into a battle like this it it takes Faith to know that it's not just you trying to overcome the enemy but it's God that is in the midst of this battle Hallelujah and if God was in the midst of the battle with Gideon then God is in the midst of the battle with you this morning I don't care what the Arts are if God is for us who can be against us blessed be the name of the Lord amen there was a a note that I had in my Bible it said Gideon strange battle strategy counted on the elements of surprise confusion and the enemy's mistaken assumption that they had fallen prey to an in uh innumerable uh attacking Force the the divinely conceived plan work better than any man could have dared to Hope hallelujah amen we know God gave them the Victory and even when when Gideon was afraid he went down into the enemy's camp and the dream was interpreted about Gideon coming in and wiping out that Army Hallelujah he had he was encouraged his faith was increased and he was willing to go out and step forth in the battle brother Brandon when he talks about patience in the Statue of a perfect man he brings out seven characters uh one is Abraham the the second one was Noah the third was Moses the fourth was the Hebrew boys the fifth was Daniel the sixth was Paul and then on the seventh the seventh uh group of characters he he put the Believers on the day of Pentecost when he talked about patience there so here you know the first quote that I want to read here out of Statute of a perfect man says patience with what it says what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God if you got real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience amen because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well I asked him last night to hear me and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience right God told Abraham and 25 years later uh there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with God and we know the scripture says that is his faith got stronger the more he waited I wonder if that can be our testimony that our faith actually gets stronger the longer we wait amen he goes on to say this put him put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so it's going going to happen uh so it's going to happen see keep him before you that's right now here you know just a little note here um God told Abraham and 25 years later there was there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with god uhhuh brother brandom says that now I like I like that that statement because you know I can imagine Abraham going to the doctor with his wife and maybe uh you know the doctor you know in the doctor's office and you know and uh uh you got all the the the the you know the workers there and maybe they they they they send a note back there to the doctor say it's Abraham again it's Abraham again and like uh sir you know look um we tried this last year there was there was nothing and and said well try it again doc Abraham please I mean I'm year after year maybe month after month and and all these visits to the doctor and and it's like this guy has just really lost it but one day he shows up at the doctor and say please just try it again Doc and Doc goes and runs a test and all of a sudden something shows up my God I mean and and and it took Abraham to be patient with God just knowing that God was going to fulfill the promise that he had made to him we got to have that same type of patience as Abraham's seed here Luke 21:19 says in your patience possess ye your your souls very important for you to have patience cuz in your patience possess ye your souls let's look at this quote out of Revelations uh uh Philadelphian Church AE Revelation 3:10 uh brother brandom says this because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation amen which shall come upon all the world to try them uh that dwell upon the Earth what does he mean by the word of his patience he Hebrews 6 13-15 for when God make promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and uh multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham you know I just love this because I'm going through this right now in my own personal life as I'm waiting I know God has given me a promise amen and I and I'm holding to that promise I'm believing him for the new church I'm believing him for our new school I'm believing him for all these things but I have to wait in patience don't get ahead of God just wait in patience when God has made you a promise he's made you a promise I'm reminded of a testimony one time that brother bis shared and I'll come back to that uh just leave it right where right where we are there uh I I'll um brother brother bit was um was with brother Brandon and um and uh he said that they were in the car together and they were they were they were hunting for a certain animal and um and brother biscuit wanted this animal so brother brother brother brandom and him they're driving out in the car and uh he's like I didn't get the animal like uh don't worry God's going to give it to you brother he's like uh okay brother you know we're in the car now and I didn't get it I don't know he said just just wait brother God's going to give it to you he said all of a sudden they're driving down the street and this animal that brother bisco War it comes walking across the street and brother bis was like now if he sees the car he's going to start running he's like no brother no don't worry don't worry he's like brother brandom stop the car if you see the car he's GNA he's going to run I can get him right here he's like no don't worry brother just let me just keep driving right and he kept driving next thing you know he says uh now brother this is really going to be impossible because if I sh the animal he's going to drop in the street and I don't have any way to get that animal out of here to I don't I mean this is this is going to be impossible he says no brother when God is giving you something he's giving you something so he drove right up on the animal drove right up on said now get out brother and shoot the animal brother B got out shot the animal and he watched the animal walk walk off the off the off the street walk into a ditch and lay down where nobody could see him but but but brother brandham and brother bisc knew he was there I mean and brother brand said look brother when God has giving you something he's giv you something he works it all out with his own plan you don't have to add anything to his plan he works it all out according to his will we just need to be patient let's keep reading this quote he says and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would would would become even even more impatient with life so if God answers your prayer like that see we think we live in the microwave age and we think we serve a microwave God he doesn't operate that way amen so you have to pray and then you have to wait then you have to pray and then you have to wait but the longer you wait your patience is developing oh blessed be the name of the Lord let our faith get stronger as we wait let our praise get stronger as we wait on God hallelujah amen it says you become more even more impatient with life let me show you this truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises the word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the Word of Promise most think as soon as we pray and Jesus name over the good Promises of God that there could not be a trial amen hallelujah but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise you're going to be tried after you get the encouragement or the inspiration from scripture you'll be tried after that now you got to hold to that word glory to God you can't look at anything you got to hold to that word hallelujah hallelujah If Abraham had to do with way that's the same way we're going to have to do it blessed be the name of the Lord he says um uh but but here it says Abraham was tried after he receive the promise that's exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph uh uh in Psalm 105:19 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will yes I like that he promised fulfillment and he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to see patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life he says may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the six age learn uh patients we read we read the history of the of the lives of those great Christians what a what a contrast we see between their lives and our hours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all overcome and and and over impatience and haste and and the prophet is telling nothing but the truth we overcome with it I mean I I I can't wait for nothing I can't wait in line if the line is too long I'm out of there and I mean I thought they said this was fast food I'm on to the next place no we got to learn patience and and God say sends us trial after trial after trial so that we can develop our patience he said Noah uh was patient Noah preached 120 years amen uh it says plenty of patience not even D fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years but he was patient waiting on God he was he was patience uh here in this next quote he says U Noah had patience yeah Noah had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy this world with rain and Noah preached 120 years plenty of patience not even Dell from Heaven Wasn't nothing just a Dusty uh just as Dusty that ever was for 120 years but he was just he was patient then God tries your patient look look at that look at that statement God we think it's the devil we want to blame everything on the devil I mean I saw this little um cartoon or something like that and Satan was kind of going in and out of the presence of God and he was just upset you know and and it says uh and so God start talking what what's what you so upset about he's like they blaming blaming me for things I never even did I want you to get this God is trying your patience whatever trial that you're going through this morning God is trying your patience God tries these virtues hallelujah amen it says after he told Noah now he said now I want you to go ahead and get in the ark I'm going to run the animals in there I want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can look out top window now I want I want you to get in there I want you to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them now I'm going to skip this next one here uh because let me just kind of help you understand how God tried Noah's patience Noah's inside the ark uh with the animals and and they know that God is actually is is the one that has shut the door God has closed it nobody else can come in no matter how much they're knocking but there's been no rain for seven days and they're still inside the ark locked up and the way God tries to patience is is Miss Noah she comes up and she says uh do you think that this was right cuz we locked in here now Noah we got all the animal locked in and no rain has been on the first day no rain on the second day and I can imagine maybe the kids was having a conversation with Mom and uh they like now mama you need to go tell Daddy something yeah Hallelujah so miss Noah shows up and she and she tries Abraham by saying do you think we're we're in the will of God what about this what about that and Abraham cannot I mean I'm sorry Noah cannot explain any of these things Noah knows that God told me to preach it's going to rain I preached it for 120 years he sent the animals I didn't go looking for these animals but God sent the animals to me I'm inside the ark and I don't know when it's going to rain but I do know this much it's going to rain but God was trying his patience even through his family he endured he saw the rain come they saw the rain come they knew daddy wasn't crazy anymore God has a way of proving things in his own time but until then you have to wait in patience brother Bram said Moses had patience oh my I love the Lord uh and and and and and the way that Moses showed his patience let's look at this out a quote here it says uh why the the way he showed this is is just go back up with he demonstrated his patience when he stood before Pharaoh with the snakes this is how Moses showed his patience he demonstrated when he stood before Pharaoh with the snakes says uh you and just just get in your mind how Moses walks out there and you know he knew he had come in contact with a supernatural God and had his commission and he walked out with that stick and and even you know when you look at in the scripture Moses threw that stick down for the first time it turned to snake he took off running from it yeah right Moses took off running which you know I have to say there's an element of of of what what what Moses had in him is also inside of me because if if I would have took a stick and it threw it down and it turned into a snake I would have run yeah yeah that's me I would have just took off running and then here's what God does say in order to take the fear out of Moses yes sir I want you to reach down pick that snake up by the tail not knowing what was going to happen and in his mind he's thinking pick it up by the tail where his head could hit me I mean it take Faith to believe God right I mean it takes Faith to go against your own uh your your own belief system why would I do something like that Moses reaches down by faith and he had to get rid of the fear and I can there was nobody there I can see the snake just looking at Moses and and Moses made me like is there anybody here that can pick this snake nobody it's just Mo I mean I mean he's here by himself pick him up I told you to throw him down now you pick him up turns back into the stick like oh my okay I'm ready to go to is I'm go to go to Egypt now I'm ready to go and he gets to Egypt the supernatural experience he takes his stick and say ah yeah you want to see something Pharaoh God is with me throws it down again turns into State and then he hears the Pharaoh say that's a cheap magician trick my my question is what were they practicing in Egypt what were they practicing in Egypt that this man could call it a cheap magician trick but what Moses did he got there and he saw you know Janice and jambers can do that they turn out they got two snakes now Moses what you got Moses had to stand in patience because he knew he did exactly what God told him to do so now I'm just going to stand here I'm going just let God do what he going to do and before you knew it Moses Snak start swallowing the other snakes and then Moses knew uh uh uh what what to do when when when that happen just reach down pick it up again it's going to go back to A rod right and now where's Janice and Jamber snakes in my rod I can bind their snakes and if I throw it down I can lose their snakes Oh Glory to God Moses had to wait imp patience here you know brother brandham says it in statute of a perfect man he says why he he said that that cheap magician trick come here a minute come here Janice and jamb throw your sticks down they throw them down and they turned into a serpent said now you cheap thing come down here to me an Egyptian a pharaoh Egypt and you come down here with some of some of your cheap magician tricks some of your hoax you know mind reading you know what I mean I hope I hope you're reading about it mental telepathy um or or or something you see yeah come down over here some of that said well we can do the same thing you do what was Moses he didn't say Oh Mr Pharaoh I'm sorry sir I'll be your slave no sir he stood still and I believe y'all got that sign right there right in front of you say be still and know that I am God no he stood still stayed right there God said just no doubt in his heart hold your peace I'll show you something when you've done exactly what he he said do seems like it went wrong stand still be patient oh we can be encouraged with the word of God stand still and be patient here you know the the the the prophet used the Hebrew boys they had patience to wait on God and we all know the story there and Daniel Alliance Dan had patience to wait on God uh but he also picked up Paul and said Paul was patient oh my let's look at this he says sir look at what Paul had to do talk about patient now let's look at Paul for a little bit amen I'm picking up Acts 23 and verse 11 uh it says this and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for thou Hast testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome so now Paul has a promise here that he has to go to Rome that's right and that's all he has as a promise but before he gets to Rome there are number of things that happens in Paul's life now I want to just pick up this uh it says the Bible states that there were several Jews who uh were who banded that they would kill him amen we find that uh in the book of Acts also in Acts 24 he was Tak him to Felix uh who prolonged his judgment for two years in hoped that Paul would give him money to buy his freedom right here's some other things that Paul went through in Acts 25 he stood before fesus who replaced Felix and appealed to stand before Caesar uh but remember the prophecy now amen because the prophecy says You must bear witness of me at Rome so in Acts 25 he appeals and says I want to stand before Caesar amen and uh uh the prophet that and since he was going to Bear witness in Rome this was a way for him to get to Rome right he also had to stand before King Ag grippa and he began to give his personal testimony of his conversion and I and I got a little note I said I like how Paul did this with Agrippa he began to give his personal testimony of his conversion what happened to him on the road to Damascus right he began that personal testimony and um and and I like it because when he stood before Agrippa Paul did not try to break into all the Mysteries amen it wasn't the Mysteries that actually impacted Agrippa amen it was the the greatest mystery that you could ever break into is the mystery of your conversion Hallelujah you talk about a mystery how did you end up here how did you come to the message how did you come to Jesus Christ that is a mystery how did God do that in your life share that mystery with people hallelujah amen as Paul begin to share just the mystery of his conversion I mean they knew what they knew this guy they knew I mean he used to uh uh uh run Christians down to kill them he was doing all kind of how did you come to walk in this way Paul what happened to you he began to share his own personal testimony and that mystery alone be to cause her grip and say you almost persuade me you almost persuade me I I I think I might want to do this Hallelujah in Acts 27 now Paul got the uh the promise in Acts 23 that he was going to go to Rome but now we find him going just walking right through the scriptures acts 27 he finally set saell for Rome and when he set sa for Rome they got hit with a tempestuous wind called euroclidon and and and and and and and we see these all the time in Florida they're hurricanes that's what this was Euro Clon was simply a named hurricane we have them all the time in Florida man most people say how could you live in something like that I don't know I I say the same thing when I come up north and feel the cold weather H could you live in something like that while they when they got hit with euron they're stuck on the ship and the ship is actually uh falling apart all around them and uh he was promised though while he was in the middle of the storm he was promised that anybody that is with you will be spared Hallelujah they were not allowed even though there were there were some ready to jump off the ship and get into some smaller boats to try to get to safety it says no anybody that is with me will be spared you can't get out the boat when the storm comes I'm going to say that again you cannot get out the boat when the storm comes what you have to do is just be patient glory to God am man say they were they were not allowed to get out of the boat if they were going to survive once the ship became stuck the soldiers were Desiring to kill some of the prisoners unless they escape but because Paul was on board and even though he was a prisoner the Centurion refused the request of the soldiers to kill some of the prisoners Hallelujah some had to swim to land others that could not swim just grabbed a floating piece of wood in order to get to safety and I want to just give you an encouragement that if you're floating on a just a broken piece of the ship you can make it on broken pieces hey you can make it on broken pieces glory to God Amen you and I want to tell you another thing you are still in the perfect will of God when you are enduring eurocon cuz we go through a trial like that we feel like God has left us but no when you're in the middle of your cine you're still in the midst of the will of God the perfect will of God because God told Paul that he must bear witness in Rome he didn't tell him everything thing he was going to have to go through before he got to Rome but he was still patient just waiting on God and once they made it to safety he got bit by a snake and here's the thing you might get bit by a snake sometimes PE people can be snakes but you got to learn to just do what Paul did just Shake It Off remember you're still in the perfect will of God even in the middle of youron brother brandom said when you've done exactly what he said do seems like it went wrong stand still be patient he remained patient in all of this as he was promised that he would bear witness also at Rome and we see Paul brother when brother Rand say you talk about patient Paul went through a and he remained patient with God am Hallelujah um here the last one he uses is the Pentecostals Pentecostal Believers had to wait until they were endued with power from the high they had to be patient waiting on god let's pick up a scripture out of Hebrews 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God you might receive the promise am for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him brother random gives a little testimony of a a sister here let's look at this in the Hours come it says recently she had sent one of those handker handkerchiefs to her sister for her little little baby that had a club foot she told the lady she said you tie the handkerchief on its foot and the Lord is going to heal it so she left the handkerchief on about two weeks and it got so dirty and she said you can wash it and then and then put it back on so she did and the handkerchief got uh getting kind of old and worn she said well there's no difference in the baby's foot said I guess I might as well take it off she said said oh don't you do that said if it comes to pieces you tie it with strings then tie it back on there and it said because I said because I know that it will get well she's seen so many things done in the meetings and uh and the woman did that she just had a few strings of that handkerchief uh tied on the baby's foot and one morning she went to get the baby and the Lord had been there that night and the baby's foot was straight and she brought the baby to the meeting to show and brought the strings that was left on the handkerchief and had the baby's picture before and where it was then how the little baby's foot uh was clubbed in like that a little baby about 8 or 10 months old and there was the little baby's foot just as normal as any other baby now what if she just throw the handkerchief away and say Well that's where we miss the blessings says we're afraid to wait on God just a little bit right see you've heard that only wait again I I hear that whisper only wait it won't be very long even now the father's hand is pleading soon with Jesus uh we will sing the victory song that's right just wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you I want say it again believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you glory to God the prophet goes on in the statute of a perfect man he says now if you got that kind of patience after God gives you a promise and you see it in the Bible it's mine it says then wait amen once you see it in the Bible and realize after you see the Promise that's when the trial actually happens it's not not the answer happens no the trial happens the trial happens when you see it you get inspiration from the scripture God gave me this promise and and I was just uh listening to tape recently unchangeable god brother brandom say even no matter what promise it is in the Bible even in the Old Testament if you see something that God wrote even to the children of Israel take it personally to yourself make it personal to you and say stand on that it becomes your personal property even though it was written somebody else I read it so I'm taking it as mine I'll tell you another thing that I've taken as mine everything that I ever love and everything that ever love me I will see them on the other side Hallelujah I I believe the prophet shared that for a reason to encourage us sometimes we worry a little bit about too many things but everything we love and everything they ever loved us we'll see on the other side how's it going to happen I cannot explain that part but I believe God Amen he says this um you're getting he said it says uh then you got that kind of patience added to your faith and see how high you're getting now you're getting way up here now all right the clock hand is getting uh getting way around too isn't it all right all right add this to your faith right all right says always putting him before you remembering it was it was it was he that promised wasn't me promised wasn't Pastor promised or brother Neville it wasn't some other minister promised it it wasn't some priest or Pope it wasn't no man of the earth it was God made the promise and God is able to keep everything he promised all right if you got that kind of Faith to know that God promised it amen say brother brandom I'm sick I need a healing awful bad accept it it's a gift given to you yes sir if thou can't believe well you you say I do believe then forget it if you believe then forget it that's all it's all over see have patience if you got patience if you're not if you're not you're crumbling off of this building here see It'll knock all the rest of it down the one that one thing God got to have that don't add it because uh that that but he says don't add it because it'll wreck your building if you haven't got patience if you haven't got virtue to add to your faith that that you say you got and if you haven't got any faith and try to put virtue on it it'll break your faith down see you say well wait a minute maybe this is the that that's all a mistake anyhow maybe God isn't God maybe there is no God See it'll break the thing right into but even when you're going no matter what you're going through even euron you're still in the in the will of God so just be patient and wait Paul had to be patient and wait to get to Rome no no snake bite can stop him no Euro cidon can stop God told him he was going to Rome no change in government could stop him nothing could stop from getting to Rome nothing's going to stop you from getting to your [Music] destination I have to move forward I'm running out of time I'm running out of time I tell you Lord Jesus let's get back over here to this war strategy oh my let me um thank I got to skip some things just bear with me I there was a scripture that I wanted to read out of 2 Samuel 5 and I'll just read that really quick it's in my notes um one time in battle David had to display this this patience when he went in battle and um all often times we go to things and and I want to show this reason I say war strategies because often times we look at God doing something one way and that he's going to do it that way all the time actually brother Brandon said we make an idol out of God when we do that we actually have to allow God to be God and whatever way he desires to work that's the way we want him to work so there's different ways that he he strategizes there's different things that he will tell you to do at different seasons of your life and and it's still the same God providing you the victory and uh when we look back in some of the things David was in one battle and God told him to do it one way but now he gets to another battle no no no I want you to wait now and we picked this up in in in 2 Samuel 5: 19 it says and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the Philistines will thou deliver them into mine hand and the Lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand and David came to Bow Paris them and David SM smoke smot them there and said the Lord it says the Lord have broken forth upon my enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place Bal parm now uh I just looked at this in the Hebrew lexicon that word bism means lord of the breaks it means lord of the breaks right and it's it's the it's the sight of victory over of David over the Philistines and of a great destruction of the image called uh Mount parm so but but when when you come to a place called bism it's lord of the breakes and I want to tell you something whenever you get into a spot like that there's one of two breaks that you can have the first is a breakthrough if you're waiting on the Lord at a place like bism you can have you can experience a breakthrough but if your patience is not at the level it needs to be you can also experience a breakdown but he's the lord of the breaks he wants to give you the Breakthrough verse 2 21 says and there they left their image images and David and his men burned them and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the Valley now watch this the valley of reim now first he says go up go up you know he inquires of the Lord he says he says go up but now in verse 23 the strategy changes and when the D when David inquired the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mberry tree Hallelujah and let it be when thou hearest the sound now he had to sit there under the mulberry trees until he heard that sound and when thou because uh he says when thou hears the sound of the going in the tops of the mberry trees then that then Thou shalt bester thyself for then shall the Lord go out before thee to Smite the host of the Philistines and David did so as the Lord had commanded him and smoke the Philistines from giba until Thou come to gazer right there in uh those few verses we see two different strategies that God gives David the second strategy requir patience sit there underneath the mulberry tree and wait till you hear the sound in the top of the malberry tree then you know God is going before you and the Philistines have been given to you but you have to wait don't get ahead of God don't jump out there wait David I'm giving you a strategy this is how going to overcome in this battle we ought to seek God Amen when we're going through different trials in our own life seek God let him give you the strategy how do you know one of these virtues is not being tested in you because God is the one that sends the test the prophet told us he tries them God tries them so don't get in a hurry don't get in a don't get ahead of God just wait we see this in Joshua I'm I'm I'm just I'm skipping I have to for the sake of time all right we see this in Joshua when we picked up amen there in Joshua chapter um uh five we'll go back and just read that really quick Joshua 5:13 says it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and we know the captain of the host is none other than the Lord Jesus himself all right it says I am come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servants now unto his servant I want I want you to get just in that little statement when when he says what saith my Lord unto his servant don't we want we don't want to be too quick to go to the next verse but brother brandom actually tells us Joshua was receiving a strategy at this moment when he when it when it says what saith uh my Lord unto his servant God was actually uh he was giving him a strategy what to do in Jericho this is how Joshua knew what to do when we get to uh chapter six this is how he knew what to do because he was he received the strategy right here but in this strategy in order to overcome and Jericho it was going to require patience but in your patience you possess right so so so he it required some patience but this right here is where he got the strategy now the next verse tells us and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose th thy shoe from off thy foot y for the place where on thou standest is is Holy and Joshua did so I like that and because uh I'm sure Joshua heard Moses testimonies of of how he got to the burning bush and you know and he was told to take off his shoes and he was standing on Holy Ground and and all the the great things that he saw I just saw I saw this great light in the burning bush but when Joshua hears this testimony amen of the same thing Moses heard to take off his shoes he he was no longer is standing in the presence of a great light but that light had become a person the light had become a man and Joshua saw a man the captain of the Lord's host standing in his presence giving him the same command that he gave Moses I can just tell you like this in every generation the manifestation gets [Applause] greater Hallelujah I'm expecting greater manifestation I I I I I want to just you know this this this strategy that he gives Joshua at this time he tells him says Joshua I want you to go up and tell the people that they're going to March around Jericho one time for six days they're going to March around one time around these walls of Jericho and we got to understand these walls are mass of walls they were they were so so big that you could have chariot races on the wall Hallelujah glory to God and and and and and and and Joshua's strategy just tell the people say now just go March around the walls just one time for the first six days said but now when you get to the seventh day I want you to March around the walls seven times on the seventh day this required patience and now after we get to the seventh day and after we March around the wall seven times then what I want you to do is have the the uh the trumpeters blow their trumpets and it says and after that I want you to tell the people that they can shout now while they're walking around the first the first uh six days no talking at all and when they go around seven times on the seventh day no talking at all hallelujah amen and can you imagine maybe somebody W to say something like no don't say a word don't nobody says anything only when I bid you shout it's when you can shout and they walked around that first day maybe the people were tired like oh my this was this was a major task and you want us to do this six days not only that but on the seventh day seven times that's what God said they marched around the first time for second day Third Day fourth day M maybe they were wore out but how somehow God gives them Supernatural stem because people know that the promise is at hand and on that seventh day they get enough strength to go around seven times now and they all wore out and tired come to the end of the battle he says now tell them to blow the trumpet and say now now can you imagine I want you to get this thing mind they were wore out they were beat down the sun all over maybe a hot florid of sun in the middle of the desert somewhere I mean they I mean they wore out Hallelujah I I want to tell you sometimes God ask for your best praise when you're wore out when when when the trial has been so great you can't even bear anymore but this is when God ask you to give your your your best shouts your best praise when you're going through your worst that's when he asks for your best they get around and say now you want us to do what when they blow this trumpet I want you to give the best Praise You Got got amen no weapons no no Cannon no sword no spear no bombs praise praise your strategy is give God praise that that's what I want you to do in the midst of just give me praise you've been patient you've been waiting on me I'm going to take this wall down you don't have to worry about it let me be God they blew the trumpets and when they blew that trumpet said josha said now it's time to let out that shout and brother the people begin to praise God they begin to worship and and and before you knew it they saw the walls just coming down yeah now the walls had to fall in a very specific way yeah because there was one house on the wall that could not come down amen and it was the house of Rahab her house was still standing and she had that Scarlet thread out the window because she believe what the messengers had said so God had to preserve her house while the rest of the Wall came down you talk about a victory but the people had to be patient and waiting on God to Manifest this great Victory here brother brandom makes a statement in the sermon if God be with us then where's all the Miracles Joshua oh the great conqueror oh the successor of Moses a man that God Loved a mighty warrior man that God loved God told him as I was with Moses so will I be with you but before the walls fell Joshua marched according to the according to the chief's Captain's orders so when did he receive the orders back there when he says you know uh uh what sayth my Lord unto your servant that's when he received the orders Josh marched according to the chief Captain's orders around the wall 13 times before the power of God ever struck the thing he marched around the wall and sounded the trumpet according to the word of God that the chief Captain told him out there when he met him he marched according to the word of God what did he do he acted upon the word before he saw the miracle amen we all have to do that we have to act upon the word right before we see the miracle you know just to sound a trumpet don't shake down a wall that you can run chariot races around sounding a trumpet but God said just March around the wall wall seven times and the last day March uh March uh is uh March 7th and 13 times as you go around the wall at the last time let the priest go before the ark and sound the trumpet and when the trumpet sounds the walls will shake down what they do he saw the miracle of God after he acted on the word of God where is your Miracle act on his word first right how could the walls be shook down and leave one little house standing a harlot's house because she acted on the word of God why did the rest of them die and she lived she acted on the word of God she saw the miracle of God that's the way to find it act on the word hallelujah brother bam goes on to say this in the message of Resurrection he preaches this in West Palm Beach amen now I believe I told you the truth or an error I had the Bible here to back up uh back up tell me I told I told the truth the holy spirit's here I believe that if each one of you will be sincere in your heart now you would get just what you asked for now when Joshua cross the River Jordan they marched around Jericho and and then they let out a shout the walls of Jericho fell they went in and took the city all want this afternoon you you want healing let's go in and take it if you want healing it's it's yours God promised it to you it's yours if you want salvation it's yours but let's go in and take it they were patient they were waiting they did exactly what God told him to do and remember the trial comes after you receive the promise but if you hold on to what God told you because he's developing your patience in the midst of that if you hold on to what God has promised you God's word cannot and will not fail amen the most solid thing you have in your possession is the word of God I encourage you just be patient wait on God he'll use a strategy he'll give you something to overcome the enemy with but follow follow his word follow his strategy you'll rise in Victory let's have a word of prayer father Lord we thank you for your word that just speaks to
