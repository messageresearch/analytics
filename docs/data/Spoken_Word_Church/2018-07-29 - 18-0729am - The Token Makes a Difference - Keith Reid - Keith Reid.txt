when eternal Bibles to the book of Exodus chapter 11 Exodus chapter 11 I just want to read a few verses right there I'm gonna read from my ear us three will let us do some other heads as we find it to

the Lord God we believe that the word cannot return to your void but Lord God it must accomplish that which you please so blesses and ours will look to you and praise you and we give you all honor and glory in Jesus name we pray amen and amen in the book of Exodus chapter 11 let me read verse 4 and the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of Egypt of the Egyptians moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh servant and in the sight of the people and Moses said thus saith the Lord about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt and all the firstborn of of the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaohs Pharaoh that sitteth upon the throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his stone against man or beasts and he may know though that the Lord hath put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated you know this was actually the time of the the first Exodus God was moving his people out of Egypt imagine after 400 years of crying out praying being enslaved down there in Egypt but God had sent this man Moses and we look at it in the natural 40 years before this would have been better in our minds that Moses should lead them out but he was filled with the Egyptians theology and God sent him for 40 more years bring him back known in Egypt leaning on a stick and said go tell Pharaoh let my people go hallelujah amen you know Moses he come back to Egypt and all the the miracles and all of that really and I'd like to speak this morning on the token is the difference the token is a difference because here it is that him and God that the Bible says that God actually hardened Pharaoh's heart in other words if if fira wanted to do it hey men you know that there was something in fear or that let him say no you can go but keep leave the animal lead the women and children he wouldn't give up but there was one last thing that God was going to do in Egypt he was going to cause a not just darkness but he learned to strike the firstborn but before that happened God begin to tell them now he said no take a lamb a lamb for a house and you're gonna keep it for 14 days and the 14 day you're gonna kill it at Eveland time and he begin to tell them exactly how they're going to do it no this was the first Exodus amen and if we are in the third Exodus we can look back at the first section of see what it was like and know exactly what God is doing today amen hallelujah him and now you know the Bible said that him and they had a prophet I've indicated prophet him he came with signs and wonders before them him in this Nicollet established that him and his word was a Word of God that there was nothing that he said that would not come to pass in other words I can say hey me like brother Branham said in 1964 question-answer he said they had perfect interpretation of the word we divine vindication that is what God gave them so there was not a doubt in their mind whether this is a word of God or not whatever Moses said I mean they couldn't rest assure that this is a word of God because God bring it to pass amen hallelujah amen on an evening time him does it kill the Slama him and they take the blood him that put it on the lintel now when they kill the lamb it wasn't the insider they put it it was an outsider I mean the blood was to be seen from the outside he's arrived so everybody passing the outer they men know that there is something about this house it is identified because the blood is on the lintel and on the doorpost but not only doctor on the inside something was happening came in they had two rows the lamb with fire hey man that's a heated Janissa how you there with me no I'd like to also say that him in the 14 days of the keeping that lamb you know their tents earning the Lamb that they chose when a HOSA take a lamb there to examine it why because the lamb had to be perfect in their sight and can I say like this if the sacrifice was not perfect then the worshiper could not be perfected so you had to examine your sacrifice they mentally clear your sacrifice worthy know when the sacrifice was worthy amen hallelujah then the worship law can be accepted isn't that the same today Damon our sacrifice' is worthy and if he's not worthy a man then your praise Damon cannot be accepted but if he's worthy then you're worthy hallelujah glory here Halloween is him and God now said him and there shall be a great cry prote all the land of Egypt he meant such as there was a nun like it nor shall be like it anymore he's doing a new thing now he said but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue hello somebody Haman God said now listen don't be afraid when you walk out don't be afraid when you take the sex in us this is no longer you Haman this is me not even a dog he's gonna bark after you Haman because God said it that way what was God doing he was building confidence in his people this was not very Exodus this is God Exodus I'm gonna move you out hallelujah I like that amen another dog movie strong against man or Pisa and he may know how that the Lord put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel do you know God put a difference between the church and the bride between the world and the church there is a difference even God put that difference him Allah we're gonna line this first section also with the third Exodus Amen hallelujah but if we look at it in there in the light of the turn Exodus and we're gonna look at some things really I mean that God was really doing among them him and because he wasn't it was just kill a lamb and put it there no hallelujah in the in the message Tolkien Peres 17 he said in that Tolkien or the blood hallelujah in the time of Egypt coming out there Exodus ah if that Tolkien was not unless all the supreme sign the Tolkien was not no good unless that Tolkien was displayed the Tolkien had to be displayed not a simple tosser payment with a token but that token must be applied hallelujah he said no matter how much anyone could prove that he was a true and the government adju him ma ma my circumcision that didn't do anything about it all they took the token not a covenant hallelujah he never said when I see the covenant sign when I see the token so today and so in the Prophet 1963 Haman September said so today Damon this is now 2018 hallelujah we say so today the bride of Jesus Christ came in with perfect interpretation can take that word that was spoken that vana and then bring it present tense today that's the power of the word of God having in the amount of the believer today is around you said oh it's already spoken but it was there waiting on you to come to your position hallelujah you might be a professed Christian is talking to you now you might be a covenant the covenant with crossa but unless the token is display in this late hour we're coming all hallelujah amen Issa we're coming now amen there is no way for him to pass over the token must be displayed it must be on the remembrance you could have come up and said I'll take you men aside I believe that to be the truth I believe Moses a prophet I believe the pillar of fire that's guiding him I believe that your whole yeah Amen witness all of it but he said believe all the word all the message but yet say now I'm just as well off you because I'll never serve you if he didn't have the blood coming in the night of the Passover hallelujah he died just the same so today we can say oh I love the prophet I love the message of the hour hallelujah hey man I believe the message amen that's all right that's in the right direction but there's something more that is required is very may indeed not just at church now but individually there's gotta be something there we believe unitedly I love my posture I love my church that Sorata but individually Damon where are you standing hallelujah and you have to be born a Jew hallelujah had to be circumcised but he said more than that it was a state of emergency it was a time of desperation it was the time like any other time no sir Haman it was a serious thing why because the life of the first born hallelujah if it wasn't right or in the message desperation brother branham said if firstborn son would have come out and look again and said daddy remember I'm your firstborn are you sure that you did exactly what the Prophet said hallelujah not your mind now no what you think are you sure you've done exactly what the Prophet said and today the people ought to say pastor are you sure remember you're staying right with the Word of God amen that is not your idea they me you not project yourself it is not your life and Hashanah but is exactly what the Prophet said your establish us in the word because many people today I've got their own ideas then they've got their own Carriere but we want the Word of God because there's gotta be something to take us out of here are you sure are you sure [Applause] hallelujah glory to God why was this why is it so required you you see amen you see when that lamb was killed hallelujah the prophet said the lamb was only a symbol it was a substitute er that is not really what God wanted but it wasn't time yet and he was holding that substitute for a time he's wrong because he said the life of the animal could not come back on the worship ah hallelujah amen why is that you see said because the animal had not a soul it had a body say that a spirit but there was no soul so he said holily the animal did not recognize it was naked hallelujah but you honey you've got a body you've got a spirit and you've got a soul he's a writer hallelujah amen so the blood of the animals stood there for a time but there's coming a day when something more is required than the animal you not tell you about the manner without the token brother Branham said what is it talkin hallelujah he said the literal life of Jesus Christ return back upon the believer is around hallelujah then without that token hallelujah do you see then we live in this world natural world and you you're contacting this natural world Damon if I want to get to brother way to not speak to me hear me I come before him EC me it's a rat maybe you take a little child everything it takes it put into the mouth because even doesn't weigh that child contact the natural world it tastes it is awry you you've got five senses to contact the natural world is around but there's something about the natural manner when his sensor century nervous energizer it brings about a reaction there's a demon so that is why this road rage hello that is why our young people react the way they are they do because you approach them a certain way they've got immediate reaction because that's the way the human being is made up and so your reaction comes a hallelujah Amen bye honey what we call hallelujah five emotions and all emotions of the human Elena you're happy oh you're sad you're angry you're a shame or fear there's your five emotions everything for right there so something happened to the natural man these five emotions even pop out so you hear something with your happy in the you years of your sad you are hungry Israa so you you know that's what i mean the wife says something another we shout that's his emotion is it rah that's a natural way the man is made up but you see with that way a man after the actor a man buys emotion even then rational thinking comes in hallelujah and a man being reformed will go and say I am sorry but but it's too late then the damage is done we say no matter what you say you say it already is a run hey man that's the way the natural man operate and so God had to do something he's wrong you see hallelujah so you think with your head your emotions trigger they meant from your amen but for you to have the right reaction him and God is gonna put something down here Ezra hallelujah Damon saw when the sensor very nervous is energizer Damon it doesn't come to the head it comes here so there's love joy peace gentleness meekness his rod brethren I don't care how much of managed reform payment if you ain't got the Holy Ghost hey many will never react right in the first bliss there's a rod that's why the token the Holy Ghost is required is arrived for without the token the Holy Ghost which is a literal life of Jesus Christ upon the believer hey man you will never break the rims of this world by your very man you're gonna be the same old person Amen that is why the foolish virgins cannot make the rapture because they are still in the same old house with the same conditioner halle-loo are transformed because you are washed amen the problem godson in Christ the mystery he said in that day you will know what day the day when this revelation what revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you when he comes in and lives in the house everything is different oh you know what we do we preach another Reformation you just got to be this way you're just gonna dress right amen you just gotta learn to do no amen hallelujah academia can do a better job than that but the believer needs the Holy Ghost is awry because the believers got a die out of themselves amen the believers gotta be transformed and you can't do that by yourself no God has gotta come in and do that for you is that wrong in other words you gotta have a teacher on the inside amen you gotta be the student amen you've gotta be of one making the decisions for you Ezra so God was giving a preview in the first Exodus and so it wasn't spirituali it was natural amen so they commander the blood of the animal and here it is him and when they kill that animal and they take him in he's a bitter herb and they put it on holiday the doorpost and on the lintel him in those paths on the outside they see that sign but it's not the sign on the outside it is telling them that something is happening on the inside on the inside their shoes on their feet they're their sword in their hand they heaped in their laminator is arrived what about you and I hallelujah then the problem God said if the token is not on display then the Covenant is a null Church wake up in the sour what we need is not another Reformation we need a bird somebody's gonna break the ransom and preach a bird to the church let the people realize that what you've got can't take you out of here no sir you need the new birds hallelujah and without it you're gonna miss the rapture you're gonna be a very good church member you're gonna be faithful to the cause but you'll miss the everly cause amen in other words may I say like you've got to come to an age of full redemption in you Amen hallelujah glory to God Amen so the worshipper Haman in this last Exodus in this turn Exodus him in this worshiper has gotta have what they had in the first section of they had it in symbol you've got to have the reality you say brookie what did they have in the first Exodus hallelujah let let us count them off know where they really standing he meant in the first section uh sir Amen hallelujah there was a night cloud there was a pillar of fire is a rod him and they had a slain lamb a sacrifice is a right hallelujah of the token Eamonn had to be applied and they had a vindicated prophet are you there with me Church hello brethren but what the devil is trying to do in this Exodus he's trying to discredit him in what you've gotten this hour and so many churches today in the message they are taking down the cloud because some skeptics say he wasn't in the mountain that day but I tell you it is saying so many people don't know where they're standing [Music] Ezra so they're taking down the cloud and put it in a corner because somebody don't believe it what do you believe hello somebody we're gonna love the same thing that they have is a run we've got Robin iCloud the purifier vindicated them that God present answer was right there in there Mitch there's arrived have we got a purifier come on somebody you know what the wall is done today or what people around the message of done you you said those who feel that they've got some education I tell you your kitchen is a two-edged sword and getting into epistemology which is the study of all truth and they said the only way can be proven it can be right or me truth it's got to be proven and so they're taking things from the message and try to prove it by education and when they come up with a 0 they said we don't believe that hey listen somebody God is not known by Haiti okay son God is known by revelation of this word hallelujah amen so they tried to take dates and time hello somebody and match it with his word let me see where the Prophet was brethren God never call you to understand it all he called you to believe I take you back to the to the Lazarus when Jesus came to Bethany Marta said master if you are here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask the Lord he will do it even now jesus said your brother will rise again you know what she did she didn't believe that she changed her timing I know he will rise but not now in the resurrection in the last day that's what the people are doing they're taking the promise of God that is for now and they're putting it in another day they tell you I know I believe but I believe it's over there there ah Jesus a woman don't you know I am the resurrection I am the life I am he thought you are dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth I believe this vow this and I believe us now this because they're gonna believe this this is that amen but that I tried to prove these things by science you know and I never like research in school because I said all the professor's are confused everybody's got another way to put it and everybody cross a line over somebody else's work and they said well this is the way you ought to do it hello they're all confused but my God's not confused amen hallelujah so watch what what the devil is doing so he's taking out those five things that was in the fight first Exodus out of the turn Exodus and if you take those things out then Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday today and forever and if he's not the same where is your fate Ezra I'm not called to prove it I'm called to believe it Ezra that's the problem with the world today somebody's at all I can't believe it unless I can prove it Ezra hallelujah so they're taking out the cloud amen and so when they take out the cloud they said well you know we don't even believe the pillar of fire amen then they believe for a while but then they change is awry brother branham said how can they believe when they've got nothing to believe with man because if you're never seen of God you can't believe the Word of God for your day hello your call under another dispensation under another anointing but the braddock rasa that will make the rapture is called for this day is awry hallelujah amen we've got a sacrifice in this day the Lord Jesus Christ himself he's a rod and brethren remember the reason there to keep the land they had to judge the lamb worthy is that right and though the church is singing were these were they they still don't believe he's worthy because they would even take on his name here's a rock they believe the church hallelujah and then they said oh we believe him we love him but you've got to take on his name in the Old Testament they had to put their answer upon their sacrifice ah and I get invited to come on with their sacrifice but if the sacrifice not worthy then their worship ratata worthy there's a rod but what a job they had in that time that every house had to examine their own lamb you don't have to do that because gold counted my lap worthy and if he's worthy and I come in him I don't know what you're saying but I'm worthy because my lamb is worthy he took my place that I might take his he be come here that buys brace I can take his place amen hallelujah glory to God yes sir hey man you gonna test your lap he's got to be worthy he's arrived the token has got to be applied and the token of the last day is a Holy Ghost where the brother said undertow can never come in effect until evening time because it's not required until evening time it's not required until you're gonna leave out of this Egypt and brethren we're gonna leave our spiritual egypt and god's gotta have a people that's ready to go and the people's not ready to go the exodus can take place how you doing mean brethren I'll tell you if you're one of the Redeem and you're not ready Haman then that Exodus can take place him and that is why there's got to be something Haman that will wake the bride hello somebody there's got to be a message then they will turn back with me and he said the messenger come to do two things hallelujah man he said according to Malachi 4 hallelujah amen to turn the art of the children back to the father's hallelujah and revelation 10 valid to reveal the mysteries that are contained within the seven seals is that is these divine mystery truth you know somebody it is these same mystery revealed truth that will turn your back but it's some believing today that the seals are not open you know and so the seven thunders are not reveal and because many scarecrow has come upon Lander reigning with all kind of ism we're afraid to talk about these things because it's hard anything you and somebody else but the word is the bride as it was an area and she knows what he wants done with the word hallelujah may I say this message will never be unpopular I am very mean this message will never be outdated hallelujah women those who see laka Raymond the message of the hour rain it was a bondage I was holding them for years they meant they've got nothing to believe with women that's why they feel that way they member to use abroad Raymond was elected to stander Raymond you thank God for the word you can pound you at every word of God [Applause] hallelujah amen and you know they had Moses a vindicated prophet is a rah today brother Wade we can look back at all that Moses did Oh that Moses said and we say the truth but you know there was some right there Miriam and then that there were days that question it hallelujah a man that Cora women couldn't believe that God only talked to Moses a minute look what Moses did you you know Moses Marion its European woman and we don't believe in mixed marriage look what Moses did if God's gonna use somebody not Moses Oh hallelujah he died become so common to them that they could not see the will of God the plan of God they were looking at the manor you've got to look beyond the man Halloween to see that it was God in the manner performing his work by a man by a very merry and so is it today are you feeling me they're challenging the word demon yet the first and second paula was accepted this around and that is impersonated everywhere remember I say to the people if you're gonna leave this message today to whom shall you go to whom shall you go hey me we've got those today that waving a jacket and people falling down on the floor we regard that direction will we go to a lying profit that stand before somebody and said oh well you've got three children the person know you've got to know I've got five is that what you go to tell me where would you go if you leave this message everywhere we go and we hear them speak there's something inside of us tell us that's not God's word that is not God's Word and if you can't poach you ate God's Word one hundred percent with an amen people trying to be winners people trying to be better than others or we're the best Church around here God never call it to be the best man you see Cain it offered an excellent sacrifice na na tato brother he put a lot of work in the bookies in the fruit basket put a lot of work in it it was excellent but Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain to that god of his back is awry and I tell you've gotta be more excellent in this hour amen so I like what the Prophet says and Christian Christian answer 1964 I think paragraph 51 he said for we've got perfect perfect interpretation hello of the word with divine vindication hallelujah hope further much further can you go hello oh Jesus or let me preach hallelujah you see God at the set us one in this day because the revelation of the broad is going to go higher and higher and higher a man is going to bring us to the person of Jesus Christ brother branham fulfill Moses Commission is it run Moses call them out in that first Exodus he call us out in the turn Exodus hello somebody he also had a Joshua's Commission Amen hallelujah Willie preach the adoption so the adoption is not your burnt is placing your positionally in the land of promise he's a rider Commissioner come apisa into the hope and or the revelation of the word which is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the act as a rouble Commission Ezra he laid the foundation and he finish it hallelujah you see because any a Tsar never presenter Abeka himself but he presented to her Isaac and the more he revealed on the way his more she see Isaac in preview until bodily he was in the field before her who is that hallelujah because the words of Eliezer materialize into a body and that is what happened to the bride so you see Jesus Christ hallelujah man there is nothing since the dawn of time like the message of the hour because hallelujah first Corinthians 13 holily there we know in part and we believe in part but when that was just perfect he's come we've got a perfect word hallelujah so I tell you he had the Moses Commission he had the Joshua's Commission he had Elijah's Commission here there's a rumor Bill Commission hallelujah I know much further can you go than Solomon amen he was a son of man hallelujah brother Brandon said hallelujah my words will fail we're not feeding on the words of a man hallelujah but we are feeding on the living body word of the Son of Man Jesus Christ hallelujah prophet revealing this on a man Jesus Christ hallelujah the matter bride is not married twists on a man she's married to this on a man Jesus Christ this is our Isaac amen the talkin will make the difference brethren may I say now without that token you'll never understand the mysteries of God amen hallelujah that's why son John 14 he said the world will not see me but you shall see me for I will be with you even in you until the end of the age hallelujah pay me when he said in that day hallelujah and sister Johnny your days not brother Wednesday he's not a brother black no no no each one of us has
