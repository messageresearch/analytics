and answers maybe not to finish it but to make sure you're understanding up to the point of where we were speaking from okay all right Matthew 19 verse 9 the fresh is also coming to him taking him and saying unto Him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever calls and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he was made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh before they are no more Twain but one flesh but God therefore hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why did Moses in command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wife but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and this will marry her which is put away does commit adultery you may be seated whoever that is blessing to the reading of the word now this is um I guess message number eight so there's no michelly on our series that we've been in and this you know write down your thoughts in other words you say well I can't put in words a question you know I can't get it to a question well write it down just in a dollar a point or say them well you know what about because we were doing last night in them and we really had a wonderful time in in the Bible study last not talking about the officers of the church and we really had a better participation when then we've ever had now I mean we had a whole lot more questions and answers and a lot more discussions and hugs like that and we're still not through the officer we got them to the deacon you got to Pastor sister pastor and the trustees and then down to the Deacons but you know we'll we're taking it up the next time and there's continued home but we really had a good time I appreciate that for people opening up and talking and fellowshipping around the things you know of what they they can see and do and and on like that so if we appreciate it men this made sure the next time you're like our weekend then do okay now we've been in what is gonna sail that we were you know the point of the question was you know this that's an old saying is uh I've got a sister's got a question yeah you know we're brothers got a question with general with is your question you know but it's a point of asking it you know and you're embarrassed to ask it so you ask you in the basis of that way you know to get it to go and that's okay write it down we got a sister that needs this answer we have an agreement and write it down in the comment I'll show this afternoon we will be having Ravi and Ruth wants to how their wedding vows renewed so they will be doing that this afternoon and if Sony you wants to join with them that would be fine we do this every once in a while but we chose to do it just after noon on more than you know this morning go to the time wise so on so let's just do it that way all right now we have been covering this whole marriage and divorce and trying to you know get to a place to understand and see what we need to understand for our day an hour about it and so we found out that what is a marriage it's when you ask the girl to marry you and shoot satisfied now if you asked her and she doesn't accept it it's not a marriage the we've met all the points trying to make it clear along the way to keep it in the right order all right so then what is a marriage is when you're making your bowels not because you're standing here at the altar or whatever making the vowels are you know but when you ask the girl to marry you and she accepts then that is a wedding in red a random we covered it that is an engagement and he said if you're engaged as far as God is concerned in you're married whether you live together as husband and wife or whatever you do or whether you had the vows at the altar those are things that just consummated or what the word is finishing up the things that you started with your commitment our vowed to one another all right then in trying to make a simple understanding of what is root of or I put these on every time because somebody come along and pick it up and they may hear it and they say well you know what are these things well at least maybe the interest enough to go backward listen what is a divorce it's simply to reversal vows I mean you may go through the courts you may go through the paperwork you may have to have a trial usually have a palliative vision of properties you may have to have all kinds of things and setting up um alimonies in and all kind of thing but the simple point is what you're taking back those vows you made your just simply taking away feud in another country you might know how the court you might not have the all the time but you would do according to their love and maybe you'd go to fornicating of a drive and you say I don't want to be married to this man anymore do you want to be known whatever would be and then it would be a divorce because it would be a separation of those violent are now we went through and covered that we read here in Matthew 19 3 where that they come tempting Jesus to ask them a question about it and said can a man put a walk this way for every calls so we covered that to the point that they were not trying to get a good answer they were wanting to kick him and trying to trap him but he answered them and said it wasn't soap and begin so it in the beginning there's just one man one woman that wasn't messed up in all the ways and and wet in the Prophet said and Daniel 70 weeks that polygamy is wrong today you know and stuff like that so we don't go into those points if that changed it calgary when Jesus Christ paid the price now it's one man one woman it's not one man in five women it's see that doesn't work out you gotta have booked get something straight so we thank god for the grace of marriage and divorce that he has given unto us to where we can straighten up a lot of situation that all right but my point has been this if you don't know you need the grace you will never ask for well guarded they did God doesn't do things like this to blanket well you just get everything when you hear that you like the song doesn't know if you don't need you know you need it you might not never asked for it that way uh-huh then maybe it's a job like me or sometimes being just you know get into work and see what it says all right nothing says it that's where we gotta stand I didn't believe it that way all right now we've gotten to that that Eve was created perfect and that they would only one male in one female in any species back there and then when you come into the fall you know it was messed up by Eve committing adultery right now we're going to get down to this after a while if i have x naught this afternoon curtsy in the message people are easily to read and use things and they'll say well you put away your wife or fornication but then they say you can't put her away from adultery now we're going to get through that in a minute and see that somebody's narrow-minded some work and miss the point i think of the truth of it go back you know we know what has happened and who can get to do it you know do it but you said well if she wasn't her and a half of whom had not lived together they didn't do this that the other so it would have been fornication you know because fornication is technically a word used for a girl that has something wrong before she marries to a man all right is that the way the Prophet described it adultery is technically a form of saying after you married all right you know in something takes place all right we'll get back to these in the minute and and review but you say well now what was it with evil art now that's what I've been trying to anchor in you that when you ask the girl to marry you and she excels is a merry now I don't care who it is and run around with sailor who who it was he didn't burn on hold he and all like that he said Billy Paul was married and you would not do the way all right because he simply they were in you know that they had went through that all right now but Eve committed the prophet said adultery right wait the Prophet to give the definition I'm just quoting these though we will bring these up with one try to bypass but quoting it from paragraph 2 29 of invisible union that said Eve who committed adultery all right now as she committed adultery see you didn't say she just committed fornication she committed adultery right why because of the fact that she was married to Adam all right now in Genesis 2 and 23 adam said this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone we are one right all right so then he was signifying or the Bible was that they were one in marriage cuz they were one in body right you know and then separated in magnitude new park all right in Genesis 1 28 they were already cold and we know this is the spiritual book that when he'll need food but they're already told to multiply and replenish the earth so Adam and Eve was married me so then it would have been adultery they put the prophets right when he said on the invisible union there right after 29 f it he committed adultery already set it on paragraph 57 of marriage and divorce that she committed adultery right all right see then that way we said well I don't care I've got my foot definition look all right keep your definition and see what walk to I like what one brother said he said he had his marriage and divorce book and then he laid it down and he wrote a bunch of questions I said I wish that man would hear where I could ask you these questions and now he said it dropped quoting him he said the Lord spoke to them and said are you going to believe my profit or what you think now you made that statement from the pulpit you I know that's the way I stand right are we going to believe what we used to believe or are we going to believe the prophets less you happy which way is it see and then I've always been quick to say that we maybe don't want to believe exactly the wording here but when it comes that we need the grace oh we're glad you know we're glad to do that it's like I'm telling the other day it's not making a lot of nobody but you know I get in trouble cuz i go around call for people and didn't have another Donnie's of the day said something to the guy that works are about you know Hispanics Mexicans or whatever you have no real quick and he went the Mexican well you know what I thought about that I'm not disgrace nope how about ever race you say well I'm not a mexican who we just used to call it mexican and we will use to call him black other times you know come that witness the languages we were using and it wouldn't rather cover it with just what was used to do it but i can tell you one time you could go to Brazil less portuguese switches Park Spanish you could go anywhere in to the islands revenge wireless and the things that would be the spanish-speaking people if you're saying and you say that if any of y'all Mexicans makes a no so we'll well I I've got a million dollars I don't want to give to ever spanish-speaking people that will admit your Mexicans I bet they'd be a lot of change in Mexican I mean what you done I like when you I said no I wouldn't change my country but you know what to say all right I'm just not making no joke or nobody it's just getting down to the fact that we used to have our ideas and we're settling our ideas right I am what well I'm not to why yeah I mean you want to go find more to England someone found some blonde races where they you know they're real wat you cannot have always said you whether you like it or not the black people can find their roots we're a Caucasian which means we're a concoction we're a mixed breed of a whole lot of things that brought it down to arrest nobody can't brag about we are all right till then the profit when he's dealing with things it's his message not mine of yours in my whole point all right then set it up to the bases the work is what the Prophet said and it's not what me and you think right Matt it's not the idea what I think it ought to be this way with it I rested that's what happened in the garden right the deeds that I think then he said that caused all this problem all right so we lay it on what the Prophet had to say all right we went through own questions and answers 1959 628 paragraph 185 the worth it brought around describes whether or not he said adultery and fornication he said the words are can be the same he said I know that fornication literally means a girl before she's married that's fornication uncleanness he said an adultery means people that are married but it's he said it's the same so now when we get down in a few minutes to it I'm going to river revert back to that and see if you still believe it because you know of where we're trying to make the sand in the last days then and be able to understand all right now we had let's start on three a joke before we or before we do the other one let's start on three hey first we was going to go over to the next and I I messed him up but we'll go over to 3a because we were quoting the others and we want to go to 3a and just I just put that number in that word with it coming right now watch he's talking about that she has got a living husband till no man can marry her care what she does and who she is she's got a living husband there is no grounds for her at all now that's the point but it's not for him causes her when we get to that in a minute not him the you got to make the word run into continuity it stated against him it's not stated to get him to remarry but it stated against her but is no grounds for a woman to divorce her husband and remarry right amen there is no scriptural grounds and nothing in the prophets mentioned for that to be done I by the coast it's that the cursor which are the same curse that was brought on the fact of what the one done in the beginning because she committed adultery the brain for the the beastly knees using the things you know and all of that coming through so then that's what we should stay on that point to see all right for now I gave you a bunch of definitions like I did the other day and then I want you to use these definitions but what I want you to think about there's a man have a right to put his life away for just any college I want to keep reviewing that in other words can't he just come up and say I want to do this I want to do that well that's what they had done in the Bible times and that's what Jesus ran into and he said because of the hardness of your hearts you wanted this way and you got it but you got it in your way all right and they had it that you could just put them away for about it huh but we went through to prove that even like if the man was to put away his wife he had to have the ground the proof son um wrong thing all right before he could put her away and marry again because it would not you know not be scriptural so we gave that now we want to do diff this straight other scriptures or go ahead pull up Matthew 19 we will get this right straight on the point to see what grounds does a man half woman has no grounds to divorce her husband now that's what your prophet said so if you don't agree with it that's your business but you just understand it what I preach here is what I believe and we stood on that and I stood on this for 40-something years right worried about this not the first time I've done this I do it about every four or five years because of the new growth and the people coming along all right now I want you to listen to the scripture you say well i can put away when I wife for this I put away for that now I want to know and when I'm going to get on it this morning all right but why would a profit say that you can put your wife away for cutting to her that don't know that kind of sounds like it's just about any calls but you gotta remember he said you cannot remarry that front amen just because you put your wife away for cutting iron and i'll give you one where he said why would you want to do it huh so we get back on that this afternoon but i'm just saying it because i like for to do that click click you mind because you you get a mindset and you just know but it's not for just any college there's got to be a scriptural column now if cutting the higher doesn't power these scriptures run here then we'll get through this afternoon then you're making it to be that you just do it for any college you're making bread around them to just do it for any college but it's got the tide of this scripture why keep reading Matthew not think alright so now let's read the scripture and see what it says and then the definition Matthew 19 and 9 and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery whosoever marrieth her which is put away does commit adultery now why would Jesus put that word except in there in other words except would be the only reason are you reading the scripture can we read it this away and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife has to have a reason to do it and the only reason all right is connected to fornication now cause you burn the bread i read we gave the quotes and the Prophet work he said if I run out and didn't do everything didn't take care of the family didn't feed him he said she can't divorce Lee marry again she called she don't do right she pen Hank divorce her no and when he got down to the point of the hires we'll get through this afternoon he said you can put away your wife for cutting her heart and honored of God to do so but he said you cannot remarry for that call cause you're the only cop right the only called any man has and can ever come up with is for the two scriptures that we're going to use and you will see that accept and saving is the same word all right so if a man puts away his wife for any other reason then it be connected to fornication do you know that's why you're going to have to unlock those doubts in your mind of fornication adultery but I know they've done it I can call a name of one brother they tried to divorce the brother are the preacher said he's got to go back and live with that warming how she wants to said no no so you can do that if for some reason I got into it hand this is my already very young ministry and I still believed it could I can read the Bible huh now so then what does the word except me hey it's the Greek word 1508 means except it means our cyber safe we'll get to that Matthew on the other all right now sit if not not translated miscellaneous can do if not accept but all right so what is the word except me the only reason you can't put her away but only for fornication right hon and then marry again yeah the cops run around safe an unbeliever leaves no go ahead we went through that when I go ahead with the next one which is Matthew 532 but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causing her to commit adultery and she was remember that North committed adultery now saving what is the definition of saving 3224 the Greek Mexican means saving it means except are to be without except without exception herbicides so there's no grounds for the man except it be connected to fornication to be able to put away his wife and marry again now we will get down and drop down to the lower levels of thoughts in doing so now let's go ahead and deal what's the definition for fornication except it be for fornication alright what is the definition of fornication illicit sexual intercourse he goes into taking corinthians back into bringing it to a virtual even part of it will totally together and i don't know how do you do that met form excellent the worship of idols see fornication leads down to the works of revivals that's fornication israel committed fornication by running after the idols of the people around them all right now so the fornication is a little isset sexual intercourse more negation all right now what is it adultery while we getting these words out of way adultery comes from the word 32-29 which is commit adultery all right to have unlawful intercourse with another's wife to commit adultery with actual adultery applies to be in a marriage or what somebody else's wife that's why the Prophet been when Adam and Eve were married and she had relations with the Beast the Beast was committing adultery with Adams wife huh no that would be called adultery you wouldn't have to worry about it coming from any other form our language now it would be that they see then there's no grounds for her the only grounds for him but around said there's two thoughts he said one thought is a man can put away his wife really cause said the other side says when we can put where her husband he said you go either way and you've missed it he said you've got to come back to the middle this is for marriage and divorce that I ask you to read and those will you need come back to the middle the work you think you can see the truth about his heart now look what he says the frame this one up for the job creator would start from that point never really a machine this is taken for marriage and divorce paragraph 227 which is 65 on to 21 and she's got a living husband so no man can marry care what she does you know she is she's got a living hood there's no grounds for her at all but it's not for hyung call to her not him get it you have to make the word running continuity said nothing said he couldn't but she came because his her not him that's exactly what the Bible says causes her it's not stated against him to remarry but her want Christ in the top notice it is stated that he can not remarry only a virgin that he goes in and explains that the the things about all right now remember what I'm saying the only grounds that a man has to put away his wife and marry again here's the fact of fornication adultery all right now in doing that then I want to stake this and then this will go through it I want you to think about something brother Anderson pull back up 19-9 because i want you to see this don't you just read it for yourself now watch what it says and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife executive be for fornication and she'll marry another committeth adultery if he puts away his wife accepted me for fornication is that money and math another he commits adultery why Cody got to live in why I centrum we're not in polygamous when I didn't do those things you know if one man one woman nice have it honey listen and whosoever marry her which is put away does commit adultery honey so if you put away your wife or any other reason than the fact that it was adultery or fornication and you Marion you're living in adultery sensible enough now what I say is that sometimes people get locked in and they'll hear the rest of what I say remember there is a grace that goes with this but where we don't missed apply for any little tiny back right and it's not for 49 different reasons I'm let's do that okay all right so let's get a point if we see for definitely the fact that city if he puts her away for any other cause and he marries now and then he's commitment no tree alright but now we'll get down with quotes from the profit if you put her away for fornication you know you can remarry you have a committed adultery you're not living in adultery she's a lot of people are free and don't really know it right they never had the situation so they don't think about all right you know that run around and said they were never married in the beginning because she made the wrong if you withheld the truth in other ways and said they were never married in the beginning all right now that's the truth of what we're getting good but won't you think about it you put away your wife or any other reason than for negation another reason than an adulterous act and you remarry urine der unadulterated everybody clear all right now we can get over any other scripture that said if he puts her away he calls us her right to commit adultery now why would it say he calls his her that is bringing back to something he's doing wrong are you listening they push her away for the reason of fornication or adultery not use the word either way coach never change with a million we will get to that in a second but I believe that a man has a right to put away his wife wife married wife and she goes out commits adultery against him he has a right to put her away and marry him i said i don't like some statements more into this series and i have in a lot of other forms or maybe being more stern and then let people out there decide what they want to believe because how you gonna talk together but around and said that Jesus put away the Jehovah the job will put away his rod Jesus put away his bride he said he proved it in the days of Luther whistling Pentecost and he put him away married again I know brother told me four years ago he said we don't want no types in shannon's see because he knew his traffic types and shadows that's reason you didn't want you understand what I'm saying he said he didn't want no types and shadows as Christ in the church well why wouldn't you want because you're afraid of them because they disapprove your doctoring life all right now but getting to the point what happens if you put her away for any other reason than fornication you caused her to commit it up right you put her away for any other rigs in the fornication adultery and I'll act of marriage you called her to commit adultery run around and said what if you want the quote said she will marry my work she's going how am I am but you caused it now like I said the other day about the guy you know that said if you put away your wife you know you can't do this at the other but if she's dead he said we didn't eat this type of gonna shoot you know like the woman she could just shoot her husband well he's no longer a lot known to which she's remarried according to Romans 7 her husband's got to be David but that make her a murderer so which one you want to face God with adultery murder according to the Bible neither one of them is going to hurt heaven right right come on is that the Bible no we're not talking about we're gonna get over and grace random now we're talking plain language Lynn the bottle that's what I told that brother this is brother we will have a meeting you know where you want to have it you got three months if it takes it now only want one service I said we're going through the scriptures or what decide we're going to take exactly the wording about that site you heard me done it before when one of the brothers jumped up said why the Bible says okay for a warrant but we're husband married me and I said work Deuteronomy 24 so I'm glad you brought dinner because we were just praying and I was right over there and I'd always wondered why see it she may go be another man's wife and the Lord came down while we were praying because we're praying all night Friday before we left on Saturday and the Lord came down and spoke to them and shows that's not her I'm not even her okay to do it I'm just say she will do it another one I'll improved it with the scripture and i asked the brother i said this brother here said yes do you believe what he said or the Bible you an answer me I said answer one way or the other I said is here I can she put her luck he won't put her husba wait and remind you or anything like that or am i right that she may go because she will automatically go and do it's go to store nature and she's wrong he finally should behave us and let the tape show when we still have the taste probably some work let the brother agree with me that the Bible is right because you can't make things and twist them outright might older brother I said we'll meet on the scripture will lead on what this scripture we just got to read whoo man puts away his wife for any other reason let it be for negation are the word of dog treat after marriage then he's causing her to commit adultery in the Oh out to answer for that right they meant use that blown enough right but is that the Bible sensible to read if he puts her away for any other reason man again he's living in adultery so then if he goes out and does and he's living in another but then if he calls his her by the fact that he pushed her away for just any reason he calls his vertical mid adult and you killed Neal causing her to commit adultery through you're guilty of her sin brother thing tell us how good we are I'm sweet with her the broad across I thought the truth is gonna set us free right now the way you receive the truth you can set us free but we don't know the true knock unit seven do you understand my point is it clear not as you believe it but if they clearly understand what I'm say the Bible fit right now I said if I put my wife away for any other reason saving our exam which is the same interchangeable won't work then fornication then and I go marrying again I'm living in adultery if I calls her right knee I cause her to commit adultery if I'm putting their leg without a justifiable reason but now if I putting her away with a justifiable reason there's no problem I thought if I have a justifiable reason to put my life away and this is justifiable reason now not cutting her we didn't men do that will cover then would it be for fornication or adultery see that I'm pretty that's the ground for he owned this okay not just any grounds when run around said he could put her away but she can't put him away now go back and get the Bible and see who can boot blood away well we don't know what the Bible said can't you read right well we don't know how to read because the Prophet never use the word of dog treat that's okay to put away I'm in red 40 years hungry you will find the quote that brother run says you put your wife away from them in the military but he says for fornication and see then that's what I'm saying the people in this message they hold a narrow line if it's something is your wife done before you marry it you didn't tell you about and then you get married you put her away and marry again but if you're in adultery you know she commits adultery you mean you got to live with her well then no no no what's that lat 40 day we don't have to live with you divorce her for committing daughter you just can't marry again now versus picture for that and is Jesus Christ could do it if Jehovah could do it you know that Adam could have done it but run city would have been burned but where was another woman to come from there's no choices God put away israel in divorcement and the fact that he will never marry her is bride right she comes back his servants not what are you listening so we covered we don't have to get this little dig number forward but and he's talking about can a brother or sister can they remarried marry if they leave their commit companion he says no in other words he talking about Nepal in the corrections and went through the other night that in the Corinthians Paul is explaining that if a woman desires to remain with the man you know right and there's no problems then you don't have grounds to put her way go get married again just call she's an unbeliever right or he's an unbeliever that gives you no grounds let me put it all know that you can't do it you can't put her away just for anything you got the saving for the cause of fornication everybody follow me all right now we went through the fact of showing what it would be in Deuteronomy 24 when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he had found some uncleanness in her let him write her a bill of divorcement given in her hand and send her out of his house all right then we went through to show you what that would mean it would be uncleanness would be nakedness nudity a shame you dinda implies changeful exposure nakedness of a thing indecency improper behavior an exposure undefended in other words honor now let's get down to something let's just read what's your profits in and I may hit the higher it cut is one of these tales engineer but I don't want you to deal on that bill this afternoon we won't cover that morning to do it so let's go down to number 25 brother honey this is taking some questions unanswered 1959 628 evening service program 187 the woman come not long ago and she said I've confessed that she would nervous and how to break down said I've confessed all that to God I said you have to confess to your husband it wasn't God that you committed adultery again it was your husband that's right I know what if a man marries a woman and she has we've done claim before she marries him and then she comes to him if they've been married ever so long and then she comes to him and says honey I want to tell you something I did run out with another man now this is talking about before you married right this is the women before they married this is the girls before they married if they done something wrong now watch it don't want to tell you something I did run out another man I never told you jesus said he has a right to put her away and marry another and what because they're not married in the beginning because she falsely told a lie against him so in God's eyes if the girl and that's why he goes on downs even this with an excellent and explains that he cautions the people about the valves and the kinds of do it and the marriage and it said in her you know if he meant have any reason but this should not be joined together you have any reason between you that's why I tell the couples who asked me to do their wedding and we sat down with check it over i asked the feeder when you been married before no either one of you been engaged before no ice as far as I go but I instruct I say all right now if you got any problems in your life you need to cover at night because you don't need embarrassment down the road somewhere that you got to tell your wife that you done this or something happens the husband lines up telling the wife you know of what he's done all right so you get it out of the way you enter marriage without any trouble you know how trouble down the road could look he said they wasn't married in the beginning because she falsely lied alright so then he could put her away brother Brown said and meridian one except it be for fornication right so he's not guilty of causing her to commit adultery I'm want to emphasize that right the man puts away his wife and her confessing the wrong she done he has immediately now he doesn't have six months to think it over and heard getting pregnant and not you know what I'm talking about they don't live together six months and then he finally decides he wants to use that because we found another sweeter smelling looking prettier girl somewhere that it wants to marry we're not playing garbage can he has to do it immediately like wave was illustrating about the man that the woman to tell the man until they got to the motel he left the motel immediately without living with her and went home now he live with her two or three days and then sought softly crying cause he got it heartbroken because she wasn't good do it and then he's dozens of you that don't work you getting into adulterous causing her to do this that the other thing you've got to be immediately we know of a brother that married and had 10 kids and then I for 10 kids and all this that the other he wound up said when she told me she wouldn't true to me when we got married well that was ten years ago I mean can kids ago we don't talk garbage man to tell me that I sure you hypocrite get out here that's just the best way of saying you're trying your best to find you some sweet smelling pretty little girl wrong in that marriage after hiring a girl but that's all right that's their big let's go to the next one which is taken from the invisible unit of the Bride of Christ 1965 mr. sweet home okay and I want to name three things that she must not get away from now I'm speaking keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this to the natural woman as Paul this year in the seventh chapter room she does a sacred trust and virtue committee to her by her Lord a certain vercher nothing else holds it with a woman that's committed to her by God she must not defile that virtue no watch it and he even does something wrong she must confess that for her husband before he takes her and make it right now see if you sniff a woman tells a man no what's the point I like to cover it all right if a woman say that letting one that way but illustrating if she had told him before they when they've got engaged and told him what she was what she'd done he cannot use that later on could divorce her feel right because he's justifying her the atom couldn't divorce Eve after he taken her come on actually taken her he's been divorced her that was the point all night now what he says the same as the church that was married to the law has to come also before Christ and we get onto that we can't be married to Christ much her husband David Wright all right before the second max she has to confess that and if she doesn't and she lives with her husband for ten years and then confesses he has a right to put her away and marry another woman that's the scripture fornication is unclean living all right now do you understand then he says that you actually have the right if your wife wants to come and tell you right now I wouldn't true you before we married you've got a right to put her away and marry again now here's the problem you don't find a direct quote that says if your wife commits adultery against you that you can divorce her and marry another but brother branham does say he'd done it in the days of Luther he done it in the Pentecostal and things he divorced them now I've proved that to you went through it that's what makes some adulteress is there still claiming to be married to him the word and your own ideas and that makes it an adultery okay all right I believe a man that you can argue me on this point because of not having a direct quote I believe a man can put away his wife for committing adultery sure but now if he calls his her to commit adultery like I want to cover that you know what I'm saying if he withholds his body from his wife that is not OK in any way all said other than when you're fasting right now I'm cover that the scripture right nobody understand it he sees fasting then he can with Brian his body from his wife other than that he came cuz he does and he called it her to go out and she commits adultery he calls to me that's right so you're guilty caused her to commit adultery you come up in holler glory hallelujah she commits the daughter I put her away boomerang in what did you cause her to do it did you beat her up did you sweater hurt her down her or he's been causing her to leave you and you're guilty of that no glory hallelujah is ok for me to remarry I'd rather have the ground that some of you men comes and I'm gonna put my wife American i won't i want the grounds from you we won't tell the church but i don't want to know it's not first thinking because you don't take a back we done comfort it's not her not cooking we done comfort that right why did you call it have you been a good husband i try did you pull away your body you know what I mean right we're adults and reframe you know with frame from your life if you do that you call her to commit adultery now we're not talking about cause you got sent overseas by the army now with wood is flying we've got everything where there will be no avenues if people can say it no you know yourself and I forgot what it was yesterday i'm looking at something but you know like in World War move too nervous I forgot what the percentage was a divorce is when they came home you know you know you song Dear John them but that don't sister that i'll give you a right to get out and do all the end here you're committing adultery I tried and you're worse than it would be if he was here right because he's not present it's not his fault he got sent away and why would you want to do that and then claim yourself to be a christian right you see what I'm talking about you remember in the quote where we're starting me want that where the sister came to brother Brennan said you know finally he said you were around on your husband and said you did you see that but I could pass that to God he said yeah but you didn't commit adultery against God he commended the dough mr. hood when you go get that wrap your honeymoon first she said he leave me some God's already let you know this didn't worry you are right yep they wound up that she went to the best ocurro's when their husband had something to confess to her yeah but what if it hadn't been that are you willing to put your salvation on the line to try to save your body Yeah right you know what i mean by that what are we willing to do is it crush her that my idea okay now he can put her why she can't put him away i tried when you use number seven we'll just give a couple days and we'll quick seven and eight this is the marriage and divorce we've had these before that's fine correct 256 thru axle e250 ages next to the other from marriage and divorce progress 256 notice you can put her away but she cannot put him away he did and proved it in a days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refused to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual apart to become pregnant with the further word of God he said the Lutheran Church recruits Christ the desires of perfusion as Warren refuses a man he's right to put her away but how she refused to how further her to you know little words to live with it okay going down to 58 let's get so it is with the church that refuses to impregnate in the age that we are now in to bring for children this age we're not Lutheran's we're not Wesley and with ten o'clock we've got to be children this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to braid fourth of childhood to say the seat child amen i hope you understand couldn't be pregnant no to what did he do i put her away in divorcement that's right and she does and she does she darken darkness put him away he put her away not now so then the question is whether or not and i keep referring back to this because i know what you're talking around it the message people it the question is what do you believe you believe your wife runs around on you would you have to live with her some people say you do I mean that that's strong that's earn some believe you can put her away for committing adultery against you you know what you can't marry me what do you believe well we only got what the Prophet said let me only use the word fornication so then what do you believe i believe a man has a right to put away his wife or committed adultery against it is free to go and remarry only in the lower that's right not just a pretty girl no right only in the Lord never noticed in all of this even the ones in this message has got multiple wives they're never married their 72 years old and their wife is 69 or something or 72 like me and the wife's coming up 70 just a month or so and you notice they go get them another wife and they prove that they could do it it's never another 72 year old woman right it's always an 18 year old ground now you tell me that's in the Lord now come on no wheat harvest with me I know about Joseph being an old man and Marian got four kids and then he married mary i got a little knowledge but listen you can't do those marriages today do you know that before Jesus Christ died at Calvary polygamy was still legal you wouldn't broke till Calvary come on it was still legal no Joseph could have had otherwise besides memory if he would pose it was legal but it went away calvary when Jesus Christ paid the price the code all types of Christ and the bride was over with negative oh hi off Christ in the bride coming to Christ in the bride was over with all right David in his thousand lives that is over with it now I didn't say that it done away with Christ in the bride down through the church ages I didn't say that i said what I meant when Jesus Christ paid the price that is it polygamy because it would only one Christ and one breath she's many member of yet but then the show that you're coming back to the beginning are we not referring to that and starting with that in the beginning of it all in one male and one female and in the body of Christ we are the feminist all of us men and women where the body of Christ so that gave big blank in it right see we're not talking anymore you talk so long but then you you wind up you know a canoe is the top of a big boat ocean liner but once you get the ocean liner you know what you get to the basics of what finished it's finished you can patter it up hurry it up make it look better but still run aground it's like all the rest of us it's about you don't jump it up out of the ground and make it a plane that's another time all right do it Calvary ended the polygamous right now it's one man and one woman but honey the man puts away his wife or committing fornication and marries another how many why does he got okay you're brian says to sorry you can't count he's only got one Jesus put away the loser to marry dimension is I mean wives design the Lutheran's was the wife until the time came that they were divorced when they were divorced that were no longer his wife he wasn't married to the Lutheran's he was married to the westin so he only had one life if a man can legal and rightfully and God put away his wife American he doesn't know how to live in wild and he doesn't need the grace of marriage and divorce because he's legally rightfully doing it right what I said if the truth was told about it it would save a lot of problem but if a man push away the way I believe it you can do what you want to have leave the man puts away his wife then later they married and she commits adultery he can put her away and marry again he still don't have one life man why would it stay about him that it says the husband of one life I was talking about administered omena deepens when you had to change the word from bishop t.d and half the husband of one wife I wouldn't say that if it wasn't for the fact that if they wife committed adultery she's dead because that's what we just read is she done it before and told him he said it wouldn't be married to start because she lied much more to live when a woman goes out running around with a man and that's to come in but why would you want to run around them say it I read it to you come on were human where I he said if I done something wrong my wife would forgive me he said if she does something wrong I would forgive her I believe in forgiveness but I don't believe it for two or three more time that's now I believe it for one time but if my wife told me about I'd say honey I forgive you but a month or two later she told me again I Johnny now this is mounting up to vice we can't count for this I don't agree with it I just try to cover everything that way you'd allow no loophole for somebody to come along with what about this well I'd uncovered what about that you see a lot of people could be free and don't know I demand to be free and don't know it if they just know what was their wives and what happened but I covered it if he calls his her by with praying himself then he's guilty of causing her right so you may not be guilty of adultery be killed it called an hour to commit I thought so you going to answer to God for causing her is your justifiable reason for causing her no but if he puts her away for the legal route of what the scripture says then she causes herself he ain't guilty even though she goes mad 20 more times need not guilty the difference in heaven but believe me the youngster I asked you to ask God what it is that you believe it because that way I can take all the tops in the shadows and bring it all the way through the cross in a church our husband has got to be day it took more this afternoon not just divorce the Prophet settle invisible unions and hung up in a closet did you read that are here today but he's got to be dead right you need to be married to Christ that's where the trouble was when Wesley come forth with a fundament of the word some people of the Lutheran's cook what they believe and moved into the Methodists period of time and would be the bride of Christ but those who rejected Wesley's message they denominated on that and died do they put away they're dead I'll bracket this afternoon I didn't think about it but another animal flashing red lights with his coming he covers the scripture about 11 you know doing time he said she's dead lost you ever that's what it is is she did moment in light of her husband go ahead and do something wrong she's dead that's why he's rightfully legally can remarry that's why it's not stated that he can't remember remember marriage divorce I mean I would ready but said it stated that she can't remarry see she calls the following well I'm late for what he's done no but you're the part of what she done and you the prophets when it said it he said she will have a land and you know what I mean how many women who ever know that was divorced mistake true you know we're having the LM state crew in God and didn't go out and commit adultery now they just went out and ate he'll hands and sleeps and kissed and now that's all unlock your door again wrong place would you understand I'm not against anybody I'm just trying to tell the truth you ask the girl to marry you your honor bound to your word okay if you don't tell that wise before you marry her to the myth then you got a problem in women you really got a problem because you're the one that's carrying the most to be carrying the truth pardon because it was your fault fault in the beginning you said I'd have been back there I whip me too in other words you think in your mind if I didn't Eve now you're over here after tooth doctor 6,000 years and all talking about salvation and deliver something and then you're thinking it over to say I would have done that nope too old too old now then around too long for the top foolish that's right okay and we'll find out when we get to it on or business afternoon that we'll find out when we get good did every one of us the Prophet said we've done ready to you that because of Eve's sin in the garden every one of us was born in golf trip that's right thereafter and i gave you the quote we're on the Medicus morning but runs it ain't no diversity you know what I say in a 924 C that's not meaning for man part of that mean for women ain't no a divorcee in this situation my brother Dale then who has any hope none of us agree with you understand none of us has any hope don't goody-goody glory glory that's what people don't like me because I get on down into the nitty-gritty you shouldn't say I never met me well did you get along what kind of life did you need what about if you put on shorts from an item in less nasty the Bible says that you committed adultery then you ain't married to it was about it say adultery you wouldn't say about that fornication and adultery everybody wants is that it why does it say she commits adultery because they need one of mad no intercourse and had no contact is just because he looks at her unless I to her yep he's committed adultery with her what am i dead like a fellow told me one time he said looking is not grounds for divorce that's in the natural law but what about our spiritual condition what about our life come on Greg I think about it I get into this series and I want to get out of here advice as I can because I don't like to it we're talking about it last night that's why I've always been that way I don't like to do to deal people you think I do I like to uplift and try to preach the gospel and get you an are delivering on the gospel instead of trying to condemn us to death who
