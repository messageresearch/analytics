[24:14] around 2pm
[24:16] and uh she called me and said
[24:19] something
[24:21] i don't think it's a spider or anything
[24:23] but
[24:24] something kind of you know
[24:27] touch the leg or something so
[24:30] i said you're gonna be all right
[24:32] you know so we kind of leave it alone
[24:36] so by the time we're getting ready to go
[24:37] to church

[24:43] it's
[24:44] getting a little worse
[24:47] and
[24:49] in the night
[24:51] she woke me up so she's going through a
[24:54] lot of severe pain and she would like to
[24:58] go to the emergency
[25:01] but just before the law has shown me i
[25:03] saw a dream and the law told me that um
[25:07] it's a lot more serious than i think
[25:10] so it's okay get ready let's go to the
[25:13] thank you let's go to the year
[25:17] so we get to the hospital and the doctor
[25:20] said if i've
[25:21] delayed a little bit
[25:25] something would have
[25:27] gone to the heart and
[25:30] she could have died
[25:31] so it was so serious and they got
[25:34] everything they brought it to the icu
[25:36] and she spent about
[25:38] four days in icu
[25:40] before they brought her to the regular
[25:42] floor
[25:43] and uh

[41:50] every nation is wanting power
[41:53] but paul said that i may know him in the
[41:56] power of his resurrection i got thinking
[41:59] about that word power which is the same
[42:01] greek word there as it is in acts 1
[42:04] dunamis
[42:05] and i got to thinking about that to know
[42:07] him that can not only save us
[42:11] sanctify us
[42:13] fill us with the holy ghost
[42:15] cleanse us of our habits
[42:18] praise the lord not only to save

[42:47] fragile

[42:51] that point amen you don't realize how
[42:54] fragile it is and it can just be that
[42:56] then it's gone seem to lie

[44:03] and and the guy that was kind of
[44:04] narrating they kept talking about the

[44:08] i got to think you know the the church
[44:10] world looks at the blood well you know
[44:12] the blood is what saved me that's right
[44:15] but they don't realize there's an
[44:16] association that goes with that blood
[44:19] but the band said it ain't the chemistry
[44:22] it's the life that was in there
[44:25] and if you can get the life that was in
[44:27] that blood in you it'll cause you to be
[44:30] like what it is praise god
[44:32] amen to god so god bless you we love you
[44:35] all today amen to god

[44:52] when brother tony got up and started
[44:54] singing yes
[44:57] we know where we're going right we don't
[44:59] know when we may make it but we know
[45:00] we're going
[45:02] and it won't be long i can assure you
[45:04] that
[45:07] i'm going to try something
[45:09] i'm doing it for his glory
[45:11] i wouldn't do it in any any other way
[45:13] it's a song i've heard a number of times
[45:15] it just
[45:16] just touches my heart
[45:19] but it may not be that well known and so
[45:22] our sister's going to successfully going
[45:24] to try to pick up
[45:26] i don't sing well with music so i don't
[45:27] know what i'm going to do with that
[45:32] if you know it and you want to sing
[45:33] along it's called how deep the father's
[45:35] love for us
[45:37] and
[45:38] it's deeper to this we'll know
[45:42] i don't know if i can even sing
[45:44] i'm gonna try
[45:49] how deep the father's love for us
[45:54] how vast beyond all measure
[46:00] that he should give his only son
[46:05] to make
[46:06] a wretch his treasure
[46:09] his treasure
[46:11] that's what we are
[46:14] how great the pain of searing laws
[46:19] the father turns his face away
[46:24] as wounds which martha chosen one
[46:29] bring many sons to glory
[46:36] behold the man upon the cross
[46:41] my sin
[46:42] upon his shoulder
[46:46] ashamed i hear my mocking voice
[46:51] call out among the scarf
[46:57] it was my sin that held him there
[47:03] until it was a completion
[47:08] his dying breath has brought me life
[47:13] i know
[47:14] that it is finished
[47:19] i will not boast in
[47:22] anything no gifts no par nor wisdom
[47:29] but i
[47:30] will boast in jesus christ
[47:34] his death and resurrect
[47:39] why should i gain from his reward
[47:45] i cannot give an answer
[47:50] but this i know with all my heart
[47:55] his wounds have paid my ransom
[48:00] o glorious god who's made mercy's great
[48:06] knew me
[48:07] before the world began
[48:11] he called me for his purpose plan
[48:16] he lives within my soul today
[48:21] how can a sinner man like me
[48:25] be worthy of my father's love
[48:31] i cannot end this flesh replay
[48:35] except his love shines through me
[48:40] how can a sinner men like me
[48:45] be worthy of my father's love

[1:03:52] and i will cause you to dwell in this
[1:03:54] place
[1:03:55] trust me not in lying words saying the
[1:03:58] temple of the lord the temple of the
[1:03:59] lord the temple of the lord are these
[1:04:02] for if ye thoroughly amend your ways and
[1:04:04] your doings
[1:04:05] if you thoroughly execute judgment
[1:04:07] between a man and his neighbor if you
[1:04:09] oppress not the stranger the fatherless
[1:04:12] and the widow and shed not innocent
[1:04:14] blood in this
[1:04:16] place
[1:04:18] neither walk after other gods to your
[1:04:20] hurt then will i cause you to dwell in
[1:04:23] this place
[1:04:26] in the land that i gave to your fathers
[1:04:30] everybody with it
[1:04:32] we've been restored back to the land of

[1:04:40] apostolic faith that's been restored we
[1:04:42] want to dwell in and abide in that land
[1:04:45] and here's the lord warning israel what
[1:04:48] to do in order to abide and remain in
[1:04:51] that land
[1:04:53] whenever god would bring judgment
[1:04:54] against israel he would take him out of
[1:04:56] the land of the covenant
[1:04:58] amen
[1:04:59] so
[1:05:01] then will i cause you to dwell in this
[1:05:03] land verse 7 in the land that i gave to
[1:05:05] your fathers forever and ever behold you
[1:05:09] you trust in lying words that cannot
[1:05:11] profit
[1:05:12] will you still murder and commit
[1:05:14] adultery and swerve falsely and burn
[1:05:15] instance unto baal and walk after other
[1:05:17] gods whom you know not and come and
[1:05:20] stand before me in this house which is
[1:05:22] called by my name and say we are
[1:05:24] delivered to do all these abominations
[1:05:27] is this house which is called by my name
[1:05:30] become a den of robbers in your eyes
[1:05:33] behold even i have seen it saith the
[1:05:35] lord and and this is where we want to
[1:05:37] put emphasis here
[1:05:38] but go
[1:05:40] ye now unto my place which was in shiloh
[1:05:44] where i set my name at the first
[1:05:47] and see what i did to it for the
[1:05:49] wickedness of my people israel
[1:05:52] god bless you can be seated
[1:05:58] bless the lord god may he add his
[1:06:00] blessings to the reading of his word
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] i chose that to start start us off here
[1:06:08] to
[1:06:10] just kind of get us a little adjusted to
[1:06:12] this idea
[1:06:13] that whenever the children of israel
[1:06:15] crossed over jordan
[1:06:17] and they rested the ark they put it in a
[1:06:20] place
[1:06:21] a city a town called shiloh
[1:06:24] and shiloh means a place of rest
[1:06:28] or tranquility
[1:06:30] and shiloh was a gathering place of the
[1:06:32] people of israel they would gather in
[1:06:35] shiloh
[1:06:36] i'd like to draw your attention also to
[1:06:38] genesis
[1:06:40] chapter 49.
[1:06:44] genesis chapter 49 jacob's prophesying
[1:06:47] to his
[1:06:48] sons and he's on judah
[1:06:52] and verse 10
[1:06:55] he's speaking of judah and he says the
[1:06:57] scepter shall not depart from judah amen
[1:07:02] a king
[1:07:03] of israel will always be from the tribe
[1:07:05] of judah right most of the time saul was
[1:07:08] from the tribe of benjamin but you know
[1:07:10] that was man's choice
[1:07:12] god chose david
[1:07:14] david was from the tribe of judah and
[1:07:16] here's the prophecy right here the
[1:07:18] scepter shall not depart from
[1:07:21] judah right and we know jesus is the
[1:07:24] lion of the tribe of
[1:07:26] and he is the king amen
[1:07:29] the king
[1:07:30] so in verse 10 is a prophecy
[1:07:32] of him
[1:07:34] the scepter shall not depart from judah
[1:07:37] nor a law giver from between his feet
[1:07:39] until shiloh come right
[1:07:41] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[1:07:44] people be
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] so we have shiloh spoken of in jeremiah
[1:07:49] as a physical geographical place
[1:07:52] but here in genesis 49 shiloh spoken of
[1:07:56] as a person
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:58] shiloh is the person jesus christ
[1:08:02] because shiloh means place of rest and
[1:08:05] we know that jesus christ is a place of
[1:08:07] god's rest
[1:08:09] amen so
[1:08:11] we're just going to try to relate some
[1:08:13] things to you today about
[1:08:15] connecting this to
[1:08:17] the seventh seal the mystery of the
[1:08:19] seventh seal and so on and so forth
[1:08:22] and let's start the the uh in john 11 as
[1:08:26] well
[1:08:27] john chapter 11 just kind of get this
[1:08:30] put in here
[1:08:33] praise god
[1:08:35] we know
[1:08:36] that the restoration of the faith was
[1:08:39] necessary
[1:08:41] we didn't know until after god sends the
[1:08:42] prophet everybody thought everything was
[1:08:44] fine
[1:08:45] they didn't know they needed restoration
[1:08:48] a lot of people didn't
[1:08:50] and praise god now that god has sent a
[1:08:52] prophet and the seven seals have opened
[1:08:54] we see how desperately we needed
[1:08:56] restoration
[1:08:57] we need to be restored back into the
[1:08:59] land of the apostolic fathers
[1:09:01] praise god we need to be
[1:09:03] restored back to the truth of god's
[1:09:05] gathering place
[1:09:07] amen remember these sermons brother
[1:09:09] branham preached about god's only
[1:09:11] provided place of worship you know god's
[1:09:13] provided place and so in these different
[1:09:16] sermons where brother branham teaches us
[1:09:18] out of deuteronomy 16 where god told
[1:09:20] israel you'll not offer your sacrifice
[1:09:23] in any other gate but the place that i
[1:09:25] choose to put my name in
[1:09:28] so brother abraham shows us that god put
[1:09:30] his name in christ and that's the
[1:09:32] gathering place
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] that's the place of our gathering is in
[1:09:37] christ we have a very precious gathering
[1:09:40] here today and it's wonderful amen
[1:09:43] brother wade got to go to the
[1:09:44] philippines and gather with saints over
[1:09:46] there
[1:09:47] and there's saints in africa gathering
[1:09:48] every and the saints of god gather
[1:09:51] together and as the dear brother says is
[1:09:53] the hour is so late we should be
[1:09:55] gathering together more as the bible
[1:09:56] says so much the more as you see the day
[1:09:59] approaching glory amen shouldn't get
[1:10:01] cold and or lukewarm and try to and shy
[1:10:04] away from the gathering of god's people
[1:10:07] but come together amen
[1:10:10] and uh
[1:10:11] those gatherings are important
[1:10:14] but all that reflects the
[1:10:16] main gathering
[1:10:18] and that's the gathering
[1:10:20] in christ
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:24] seven church ages have come
[1:10:26] and in every age god sent a messenger to
[1:10:28] gather his elect
[1:10:30] into himself
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] here we have a prophecy by the high
[1:10:35] priest ephesus in saint john chapter 11.
[1:10:40] in verse 47 you know it quite well i'm
[1:10:43] sure and we're just going to verse uh
[1:10:47] 50 and 51 it says nor consider that is
[1:10:50] expedient for us that one man should die
[1:10:52] for the whole for the people and that
[1:10:55] the whole nation perished not and this
[1:10:57] spake he not of himself but being high
[1:10:59] priest that year he prophesied that
[1:11:01] jesus should die for that nation and not
[1:11:04] only for that nation only but that also
[1:11:07] he should gather together
[1:11:11] in one the children that are
[1:11:14] that were scattered abroad amen now i
[1:11:17] know about you but it rejoices my heart
[1:11:19] to know
[1:11:21] assuredly
[1:11:22] that god almighty is on the job
[1:11:25] gathering his elected children into that
[1:11:28] place
[1:11:29] getting them people ready and prepared
[1:11:31] amen to go to the marriage supper of the
[1:11:33] lamb amen
[1:11:35] gathering them in christ
[1:11:38] which is the word made manifest for the
[1:11:40] age that they live in gathering them in
[1:11:42] that vindicated word gather them into
[1:11:44] that place amen because jesus christ is
[1:11:47] the way the truth and the life and
[1:11:49] without the way there ain't no going
[1:11:51] without the life there's no living amen
[1:11:53] without the truth there's no knowing
[1:11:55] amen he's the way the truth and the life
[1:11:57] praise god he's perfect everything
[1:12:00] is that right
[1:12:02] i don't know about you but there ain't
[1:12:03] no greater place to gather but in christ
[1:12:06] and the bible says that for by one
[1:12:07] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:12:11] there is a gathering place amen
[1:12:13] praise god
[1:12:15] there is a questions and answers
[1:12:18] question that was just wonderful it
[1:12:20] struck my heart i found it late but it's
[1:12:21] the first quote i asked the brothers to
[1:12:23] get up there out of 64 to questions and
[1:12:26] answers paragraph 190.
[1:12:28] the question was put to brother branham
[1:12:30] just like this
[1:12:31] he says
[1:12:34] when
[1:12:35] and where will the people of god gather
[1:12:37] for the last word
[1:12:40] right huh
[1:12:41] how many of you know brother brown had
[1:12:42] the answer right amen where'd brother
[1:12:44] brown get his answer from
[1:12:46] the bible
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:49] he says in christ
[1:12:52] yep for the last day they'll gather in
[1:12:55] christ
[1:12:56] this is fascinating brother sisters
[1:12:58] because people thought the gathering
[1:13:00] place was in a church the gathering
[1:13:02] place was in her the church but it's not
[1:13:05] the gathering place is in him the word
[1:13:08] is that right that's the gathering place
[1:13:13] so
[1:13:14] praise god for that revelation right
[1:13:17] there's a difference between just
[1:13:19] attending church
[1:13:20] anybody can walk through the door of a
[1:13:22] church
[1:13:23] but it's the holy ghost that places them
[1:13:25] in this place
[1:13:26] in christ amen amen
[1:13:29] the gathering
[1:13:30] is of the lord right
[1:13:33] there's a gathering of man
[1:13:35] but there's a gathering of the lord
[1:13:36] right
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:38] we want to be of the gathering that's of
[1:13:40] the lord
[1:13:41] called sanctified filled and placed
[1:13:44] positionally in that place
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:50] uh let's have that scripture in
[1:13:52] ephesians
[1:13:53] 4 30.
[1:13:55] sorry i jumped ahead to the quotes there
[1:13:57] brothers
[1:13:58] here's one ephesians chapter 4 verse 13.
[1:14:03] talking about the fivefold ministry
[1:14:05] there
[1:14:06] for the perfecting of the saints right
[1:14:08] and then verse 13 till we all come
[1:14:11] in the unity of
[1:14:13] the faith
[1:14:14] how many faiths are there
[1:14:16] just one faith
[1:14:17] amen there's one body right so there's
[1:14:20] only one gathering place
[1:14:22] is that right
[1:14:23] that's right amen till we all come in
[1:14:26] the unity of the faith right and of the
[1:14:29] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[1:14:31] perfect man
[1:14:32] uh to the measure of the stature of the
[1:14:34] fullness of christ amen being in that
[1:14:37] gathering place
[1:14:39] been in that place
[1:14:40] amen so you know what jesus said in
[1:14:43] matthew 24 28 i believe it was
[1:14:46] where the carcasses there will the
[1:14:48] eagles be
[1:14:49] gathered together
[1:14:51] and that carcass is the fresh kill of
[1:14:53] the word
[1:14:54] amen and we also realize if we just take
[1:14:58] a minute here
[1:14:59] and met and and consider the things
[1:15:01] brother brandon brought to us in those
[1:15:02] various sermons of uh
[1:15:04] god's provided place of worship and
[1:15:06] sermons like that
[1:15:07] where
[1:15:09] he shows us that jesus christ
[1:15:12] is the word made manifest in the flesh
[1:15:15] and that is the place god put his name
[1:15:18] brother branham teaches us that in every
[1:15:20] age when the word is manifested in that
[1:15:23] age that's jesus christ
[1:15:25] so whatever age you're living in the
[1:15:28] word that was written for that age the
[1:15:30] spirit of god quickens that word makes
[1:15:32] that word live for that hour that's
[1:15:34] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:15:36] and forever and that's where god put his
[1:15:38] name
[1:15:40] god puts his name
[1:15:41] in the manifestation of the word
[1:15:44] is that right
[1:15:46] well the revelation is that's the only
[1:15:48] place god accepts worship
[1:15:50] that's the only place you can worship
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] i know it's a hard pill to swallow but
[1:15:57] anybody that tries to worship god
[1:15:59] outside of that place
[1:16:01] is not being received
[1:16:04] the worship's not being accepted right
[1:16:06] because god only accepts worship in the
[1:16:08] place that he put his name
[1:16:10] and the only place he put his name is
[1:16:12] where the words manifested
[1:16:14] is that right
[1:16:16] that's right so it's awfully important
[1:16:18] to know what word is being manifested
[1:16:21] for the hour that you live in amen amen
[1:16:24] even in the message realm
[1:16:26] the thing is advanced in the last 50
[1:16:29] years the revelation of the word
[1:16:32] the understanding of the message
[1:16:34] the putting together of the word
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:39] people still walking around with puzzle
[1:16:41] pieces missing yeah
[1:16:43] right
[1:16:44] this dear lady loved her husband so much
[1:16:47] and her husband liked to put puzzles
[1:16:49] together
[1:16:50] and she brought him a puzzle home and
[1:16:52] she was pulling it out of the car and
[1:16:54] dropped the box on the driveway and
[1:16:56] spilled the puzzle pieces all over the
[1:16:58] driveway and she gathered them all up
[1:17:00] best she could and took it in the house
[1:17:02] gave it to the husband and she and he
[1:17:04] was like oh thank you so much dear i
[1:17:06] just sit here this afternoon and put my
[1:17:08] puzzle together
[1:17:09] and he put his puzzle together and
[1:17:11] there's seven pieces missing
[1:17:13] he said dear i don't have all the pieces
[1:17:16] oh my goodness
[1:17:18] i thought i picked them all up i must
[1:17:20] have lost them somewhere
[1:17:22] and some dear neighbor of theirs came
[1:17:24] over and her eyesight wasn't too good so
[1:17:26] she had to have a little bit of help
[1:17:28] amen god sent him a prophet
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:33] god sent him somebody that could see
[1:17:34] real good
[1:17:36] amen and that person was able to see and
[1:17:38] scope out them seven pieces lost in the
[1:17:40] driveway
[1:17:41] brought him up to the door knocked on
[1:17:42] the door and said here you go neighbor
[1:17:44] here's the seven pieces you've been
[1:17:45] missing and he was able to bring them
[1:17:47] seven pieces in there and put them right
[1:17:49] in their place and the picture was
[1:17:50] perfect
[1:17:51] amen what we need today is an
[1:17:54] understanding
[1:17:55] that the picture is perfect
[1:17:57] it's been put together
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:00] god sent us a seer in these last days we
[1:18:03] don't have no missing puzzle pieces
[1:18:04] right a lot of people like to think we
[1:18:06] are they like to preach we do but we
[1:18:09] don't
[1:18:10] it's perfect
[1:18:11] just got to have anointed eyes to see a
[1:18:13] perfect message
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:16] is that right
[1:18:17] yes sir
[1:18:19] so without the picture being perfect
[1:18:22] and this is what i share with you today
[1:18:24] and don't take my word for it just keep
[1:18:26] studying but without the picture being
[1:18:28] put together perfect you can't have
[1:18:30] rapturing faith
[1:18:33] rapturing faith depends upon having the
[1:18:36] full word restored in these last days
[1:18:39] let's start in our first in the quote of
[1:18:41] first seal
[1:18:43] paragraph 75
[1:18:46] brother brahm says
[1:18:49] and then there's coming forth seven
[1:18:50] mysterious thunders that's not even
[1:18:52] written at all and we know he
[1:18:55] recorrected that later on and said it's
[1:18:57] not something not written in the word
[1:18:58] something that's been hid
[1:19:00] in the word
[1:19:03] that's right and i believe that through
[1:19:05] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[1:19:07] the last days in order to get the bride
[1:19:09] together
[1:19:10] for rapturing faith
[1:19:12] to get the bride together amen amen
[1:19:16] now let's just
[1:19:18] use some plain language here
[1:19:20] and get it out of our heads that we got
[1:19:22] to get together
[1:19:23] physically or geographically in a
[1:19:25] natural place
[1:19:27] right
[1:19:28] because jesus said that the rapture
[1:19:30] would be universal
[1:19:32] there'll be two in the bed and it's at
[1:19:33] night time over here but there'll be two
[1:19:35] in the field working as daytime over
[1:19:37] there
[1:19:38] so when the translation happens
[1:19:40] it happens worldwide
[1:19:43] but there is a gathering place
[1:19:46] and your brothers and sisters overseas
[1:19:48] are gathered in the same place you're
[1:19:50] gathered in hearing the same voice
[1:19:52] you're hearing coming into the same
[1:19:54] faith the same revelation that you're
[1:19:55] coming into
[1:19:57] having the same faith perfected in your
[1:19:59] heart is being perfected in their heart
[1:20:01] because we're all receiving the same
[1:20:03] revelation
[1:20:04] through the same voice of the archangel
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:08] so
[1:20:10] these seven mysteries are revealed in
[1:20:12] last days in order
[1:20:14] to get the bride together
[1:20:18] to get the bride together with who
[1:20:20] to get the bride together where
[1:20:24] our lord jesus christ
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] invisible union paragraph 199.
[1:20:33] praise god
[1:20:35] don't you know when you get invited to
[1:20:37] speak somewhere you get everything
[1:20:38] thrown at you but the kitchen sink
[1:20:40] been struggling but i'm trying to throw
[1:20:41] it back
[1:20:43] praise god
[1:20:46] our gathering place is in christ amen
[1:20:50] now paul wrote the new testament
[1:20:53] that's right he wrote romans and romans
[1:20:55] and all the rest of it there hebrews and
[1:20:57] timothy and so forth and to do that he
[1:20:59] had to separate from himself and go down
[1:21:01] in arabia into a desert for three years
[1:21:04] get the revelation of god
[1:21:06] oh you say how about matthew mark luke
[1:21:07] and john they were scribes that just
[1:21:10] wrote what jesus did
[1:21:12] paul separated put the word together
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] that messenger did for them people what
[1:21:18] our messenger did for us
[1:21:20] put the word together
[1:21:22] he said we get many sermons and tapes so
[1:21:25] you can dovetail all
[1:21:27] scripture right
[1:21:29] paul separated put the word together
[1:21:31] that's right well then look
[1:21:32] if it taken that and had to go to a
[1:21:35] desert away from their loved ones
[1:21:36] remember what time is it sir mr brother
[1:21:39] brown i'm talking about how to go out
[1:21:40] west how many ever heard it say amen
[1:21:43] congregation says amen what is exactly
[1:21:46] what's exactly right amen then we've got
[1:21:48] the revelation in these last days for
[1:21:51] the message of the lord god to gather
[1:21:53] his bride together right
[1:21:56] amen there's something about that voice
[1:21:58] ain't there right that voice is what god
[1:22:01] uses to gather that bride together
[1:22:04] no other age has it been promised it's
[1:22:07] promised in this age malachi 4 luke 17
[1:22:10] 30. amen saint john 14 12 2 38 those
[1:22:14] promises is just exactly like john the
[1:22:16] baptist identified himself in the
[1:22:18] scripture
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:22] so just going to try to set you up a
[1:22:24] little bit for tomorrow because we're
[1:22:25] going to just kind of close here pretty
[1:22:27] quick but we're just going to try to
[1:22:28] build into something and
[1:22:30] snowball right
[1:22:35] now jesus identified himself
[1:22:37] is that right right
[1:22:39] jesus identified himself in the
[1:22:41] scripture
[1:22:42] is that right remember when brother
[1:22:44] branham was in memphis tennessee and god
[1:22:46] grounded that plane
[1:22:48] and god sent his prophet down in that
[1:22:50] neighborhood right and seeing that dear
[1:22:52] lady sitting at the gate
[1:22:53] and she said parson you ever read that
[1:22:55] story in the bible about the shunammite
[1:22:57] woman
[1:22:58] and robert said yes and she said well
[1:23:00] parson as that kind of woman
[1:23:03] she identified herself in the scripture
[1:23:05] and she was in prayer to the lord said
[1:23:07] here's the son you gave me like that
[1:23:08] shenanimite woman but where's your
[1:23:09] elijah
[1:23:11] that's faith
[1:23:12] putting herself right in that word is
[1:23:14] that right and god come right down to
[1:23:16] that channel and moved on his prophet
[1:23:18] and brought the elijah right to that
[1:23:20] shunammite woman amen
[1:23:22] praise the lord that's a good example to
[1:23:24] follow
[1:23:25] that's why you want to take the message
[1:23:27] back to the scripture
[1:23:29] amen jesus identified himself what'd
[1:23:32] they say away was such a person john is
[1:23:34] a wow man the church wasn't able to
[1:23:35] receive it that's the pattern neither
[1:23:37] will the church receive it today
[1:23:40] though it be scripturally vindicated
[1:23:42] up one side down the other
[1:23:45] vindicated
[1:23:48] think we're crazy
[1:23:50] they think the joke's on us
[1:23:52] but we're following vindication
[1:23:55] the joke's not on us a joke's on them
[1:23:58] we're following something that's
[1:23:59] vindicated proven
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:03] but the gathering of the people there is
[1:24:06] a gathering of the people amen
[1:24:09] now the rapture message
[1:24:12] praise god
[1:24:16] the third thing is a trumpet
[1:24:18] which always at the feast of trumpets is
[1:24:20] calling the people to a feast and
[1:24:22] that'll be the bright supper the lamb's
[1:24:23] supper with the bride right in the sky
[1:24:26] see
[1:24:27] the first thing comes forth is his
[1:24:29] message
[1:24:30] which is the shout out thessalonians 4
[1:24:32] 16 amen
[1:24:34] the shout the voice and the trump but
[1:24:36] the first thing is that shout and he
[1:24:37] says the first thing comes forth is his
[1:24:40] message
[1:24:41] calling his bride together
[1:24:44] calling his bride together
[1:24:47] the next thing is the resurrection how
[1:24:49] many believes we're real close to that
[1:24:50] right now i believe with all my heart
[1:24:53] god help us to live so separated from
[1:24:55] the things of the world and live right
[1:24:57] up into this word here amen we can
[1:24:59] change into atoms when that hour comes
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:03] praise god we want to be looking for our
[1:25:04] lord jesus christ
[1:25:08] now end time evangelism
[1:25:10] this quote always gets me right here
[1:25:12] you look around what goes on in churches
[1:25:14] what goes on in people's lives
[1:25:17] and you realize this right here in end
[1:25:19] time evangelism paragraph 222
[1:25:23] this is pretty plain
[1:25:25] now we're going to end right here by
[1:25:27] saying this the end time message
[1:25:30] is to get the bride ready and prepared
[1:25:33] for the rapture
[1:25:35] exactly right
[1:25:37] what else is there to do
[1:25:40] huh going to church is important but
[1:25:42] that's just part of it your church going
[1:25:44] to church is supposed to get you to
[1:25:46] serve to get you ready and prepared for
[1:25:48] the rapture
[1:25:50] that's the way you should look at it
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:53] because you're coming to church to feed
[1:25:55] on the message is that right and what'd
[1:25:56] that song say about a body change today
[1:25:59] keep feasting on the word
[1:26:01] amen
[1:26:02] strength comes by
[1:26:04] the word of god the revelation of the
[1:26:06] word amen
[1:26:08] let's look at uh escape hither come
[1:26:10] quickly
[1:26:14] in 1958 on paragraph e
[1:26:17] 44 escape hither come quickly
[1:26:20] down at the end do we have that
[1:26:21] highlighted we're going to have to read
[1:26:23] the whole thing
[1:26:24] right there brother brown makes this
[1:26:25] statement
[1:26:27] and the worldwide vision
[1:26:30] is to make more money
[1:26:34] huh
[1:26:35] the worldwide vision is to buy new
[1:26:37] clothes
[1:26:40] the worldwide vision is for the body of
[1:26:43] the lord jesus christ to get ready for
[1:26:46] the rapture
[1:26:48] that man caught brother branham around
[1:26:50] the church after that meeting one day
[1:26:51] and said brother branham you scare the
[1:26:53] people
[1:26:54] he says what do you mean scare the
[1:26:55] people talk about the coming of the lord
[1:26:58] and brother branson said what people
[1:26:59] not god's people
[1:27:02] huh not god's people that's the greatest
[1:27:04] thing he can think of was the coming of
[1:27:06] the lord
[1:27:09] you preach that sometimes you can see
[1:27:11] the look in people's faces they're not
[1:27:12] ready
[1:27:14] they would rather push off the coming of
[1:27:16] the lord another 10 years
[1:27:19] huh
[1:27:20] i had somebody actually tell me and i'm
[1:27:21] sorry i'm going to close here in a
[1:27:23] minute
[1:27:24] they said brother matthew i want to see
[1:27:27] my children grow up
[1:27:30] i said well i want to see my children
[1:27:31] grow up too but i want to see jesus more
[1:27:33] right
[1:27:35] and that's the way it is
[1:27:37] the lord jesus christ should mean more
[1:27:38] to you than anything
[1:27:40] he's perfect everything
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:44] all in all forever jesus will i sing
[1:27:46] everything in jesus and jesus everything
[1:27:51] amen that's right the coming of the lord
[1:27:53] jesus
[1:27:55] praise god
[1:27:57] now that gathering place in shiloh was
[1:28:00] very important the ark of the covenant
[1:28:02] stayed there for years and years and
[1:28:04] years stayed there through the whole
[1:28:05] time of the judges if you remember
[1:28:07] hannah
[1:28:09] she was the second wife
[1:28:10] and the first wife of that gentleman's
[1:28:12] name i can't recall his name right now
[1:28:14] but
[1:28:14] she was bearing him children and hannah
[1:28:16] couldn't bear children
[1:28:18] so hannah goes to the tabernacle in
[1:28:20] shiloh and cries out before the lord and
[1:28:22] eli thought she was drunk
[1:28:24] and she was crying to the lord so she
[1:28:26] can bear a child and god gave her samuel
[1:28:30] and samuel was raised in shiloh
[1:28:32] amen that's right and
[1:28:35] whenever
[1:28:37] that tabernacle as we read in jeremiah
[1:28:40] the lord was telling them go look at
[1:28:41] what happened to shiloh where my name
[1:28:43] was at the first
[1:28:44] god put his name there
[1:28:47] and uh
[1:28:50] whenever in joshua chapter 18
[1:28:53] there were seven remaining tribes left
[1:28:55] to be placed
[1:28:57] and joshua told him why stan ye lack
[1:29:00] concerning the promise of god go up and
[1:29:01] take the land
[1:29:03] and he told them to go up and down the
[1:29:04] land describe the land in a book and
[1:29:07] there were seven tribes so there's seven
[1:29:09] parts in a book that they described
[1:29:11] so they brought a seven part book to
[1:29:13] joshua
[1:29:14] and the bible says that joshua stood in
[1:29:17] the door of the tabernacle in shiloh
[1:29:20] amen and i believe with all my heart
[1:29:22] brother branham was in shiloh
[1:29:24] spiritually speaking
[1:29:26] because shiloh is christ
[1:29:28] amen and just as joshua divided a seven
[1:29:31] part book for the seven remaining tribes
[1:29:33] to enter into their
[1:29:34] inheritance
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:37] god's prophet stood in shadow in the
[1:29:39] shiloh in these last days
[1:29:41] and revealed the seven part book so we
[1:29:43] can enter into our part
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:46] it's by the opening of the word you
[1:29:48] recognize your place and your position
[1:29:50] in this day and in this hour
[1:29:52] and it's that truth that's connected to
[1:29:55] rapturing faith
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:58] so so god bless you today my brothers
[1:29:59] and sisters i just wanted to kind of get
[1:30:01] the thoughts started right there
[1:30:04] amen so god bless you i appreciate being

[1:30:18] gathering place amen god bless you
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:22] god bless you brother amen
[1:30:30] and christ said what he's the word
[1:30:33] right that was brother moak's favorite
[1:30:34] saiyan
[1:30:36] he's saying christ is the word
[1:30:38] see that's what it means right let's
[1:30:40] stand together
[1:30:41] sing and just come on musicians and
[1:30:43] we'll sing a little bit and let the
[1:30:45] sisters get everything ready downstairs
[1:30:48] and get ready to where we can fellowship
[1:30:49] together and eat together
[1:30:51] and have a good time in that tell our
[1:30:53] brother how much you appreciate the
[1:30:54] message because i believe it
[1:30:57] i believe i want to stay in shiloh don't
[1:30:58] you
[1:31:00] i want to be where the word's at
[1:31:03] all right
[1:31:04] and and that way then you don't have to
[1:31:06] worry about the rest of it
[1:31:08] it'll take care of itself
[1:31:10] all the other things that we always you
[1:31:12] know concerned about who's going to be
[1:31:13] president
[1:31:15] like i told you one time years ago you
[1:31:17] know when we were talking about it i
[1:31:18] said you want me to tell you who's going
[1:31:19] to be president
[1:31:21] everybody's thinking boy i had some kind
[1:31:23] of a vision or had something like that i
[1:31:25] said
[1:31:26] the bible says i put in kings and take
[1:31:29] out kings
[1:31:30] so that's who's going to be there who
[1:31:32] god wants to be the next president
[1:31:34] whether it be hillary or
[1:31:37] her husband again
[1:31:39] you said he can't do that well they can
[1:31:41] do a lot of things if they want to
[1:31:43] ain't nothing we can do about it let's
[1:31:45] just sing and worship a little bit until
[1:31:47] they get ready to 604 in the spiral book
[1:31:50] until they get ready to
[1:31:52] get to supper and everything fixed for
[1:31:54] us and you know
[1:32:08] you have been through
[1:32:16] anybody have a need because we believe
[1:32:19] praying for the
[1:32:37] oh
[1:32:38] i'll see
[1:32:48] i'll see you
[1:32:51] at that meeting
[1:33:05] why would we be concerned about anything
[1:33:07] else other than the message
[1:33:12] they're gonna put us in the rapture to
[1:33:13] know who's gonna be president
[1:33:16] that won't work
[1:33:18] but to know the message of the hour
[1:33:32] we may not have been there to see it
[1:33:34] some of
[1:33:41] now we can see the real true meaning
[1:33:53] the rapture
[1:34:14] you know i told the church one day like
[1:34:16] this
[1:34:20] when did the rapture start
[1:34:26] i believe it started on the day of
[1:34:28] pentecost
[1:34:32] because that's when the holy ghost came
[1:34:35] to put somebody in the heavenly places
[1:34:38] in christ jesus
[1:34:40] so it began back there
[1:34:43] we're in the manifestation of the
[1:34:45] finishing up
[1:34:48] we're in the part where
[1:34:50] it's going to be made manifest and
[1:34:51] change his body it started back there
[1:34:55] but if you don't have that baptism of
[1:34:57] the holy ghost that new birth
[1:35:10] to start with
[1:35:14] reading the other day where the probably
[1:35:15] said you can't know that god is god
[1:35:18] without having the new birth
[1:35:20] how can you
[1:35:22] oh you got to have something on the
[1:35:23] inside
[1:35:26] to explain it to you
[1:35:28] now what's on the outside that's
[1:35:30] wonderful
[1:35:34] like i've always said and i believe it
[1:35:37] and the prophet of god cannot even give
[1:35:39] you a revelation
[1:35:42] even brother rather said jesus
[1:35:45] couldn't give you a revelation
[1:35:50] come on do you believe that
[1:35:52] he said the holy ghost is the only
[1:35:55] repealer of the world
[1:35:58] thank god for the ones who brings it to
[1:36:00] us
[1:36:02] but that inside man is not there
[1:36:06] that new birth
[1:36:08] no wonder the prophet would say one day
[1:36:10] he said the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:36:13] the most important thing in your life
[1:36:17] but only by that can you
[1:36:19] come to a point
[1:36:22] only by that when we come to a change
[1:36:26] to a manifestation of christ
[1:36:30] wonderful isn't it
[1:36:32] think of the word that we have heard
[1:36:36] when we used to question about these
[1:36:38] things that was in the bible and written
[1:36:40] out
[1:36:41] we wondered what they were and
[1:36:44] we had opinions and ideas
[1:36:51] you know that
[1:36:52] what was it clarence larkin it was him
[1:36:55] that said the white horse rider
[1:36:58] was the antichrist
[1:37:00] that was before brother branham ever
[1:37:01] come along
[1:37:04] but he wasn't a prophet
[1:37:06] he just made a good guess or a good
[1:37:08] thought
[1:37:10] because he couldn't put it in the bible
[1:37:12] because he was sitting on the horse
[1:37:15] right
[1:37:16] he was sitting on the horse the prophet
[1:37:18] was talking about he was in the church
[1:37:20] the prophet was talking about
[1:37:23] but then when the prophet came said he
[1:37:24] just put it all right in order
[1:37:27] and you could see it
[1:37:29] what a wonderful day what a wonderful
[1:37:31] time what a wonderful hour that you and
[1:37:34] i live in go ahead
[1:37:37] we're waiting on this word from
[1:37:38] downstairs

[1:38:13] and you have to love his word
[1:38:16] you know if you love him
[1:38:18] you gotta love me
[1:38:32] that's why god is so good
[1:38:35] all things are passed away
