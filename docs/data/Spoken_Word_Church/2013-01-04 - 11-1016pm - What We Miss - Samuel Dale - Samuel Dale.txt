time amen and uh you know we you prayed there a moment ago about it or prayed was it while ago when you prayed cuz they was telling me this part of it that about the internet system we were having trouble well straighten that they sent us word tell us the word back pray what I was thinking about was you know I bet they wonder what kind of a church we are they probably think we're about 50,000 spread over 10 acre field you know and uh you know kind of a worldwide system going that's using up bandwidth that you know they're having to give us extra to be able to uh to do it and I bet you the people think Bo they're doing and some of them on the Internet unless they go live they probably think but then they click on live and all Lord just look around and see there's about a hundred of us but we do have a good time in the Lord and really love our children and them to be part of it and everything else and anybody else want to fellowship with us by way of internets and things that's good just you just open up and do what you want to and have a good time Brother Gary said he was down at his house there or down with little be and said you know he just sitting there playing uh the banjo with everybody playing here so just have a good time out there we're having a good time here in the Lord amen so if you'd like turnning your script remember that brother for will be with us this coming Saturday I mean Sunday be but he'll be with us cuz he's coming Thursday back from Jamaica and he and I'll be hunting for a couple of days and and then we'll have some fellowship together all of us together and then brother Ron Spencer will be here with us on the 29th and the 30th which is Saturday and Sunday and then we'll have uh you know a time of doing and fellowshipping with them around the meal and all and I know your sisters get everything ready you always do and you you put on a big spread and we have a good time eating together and fellowshipping together cuz it won't be any Sunday afternoon service on the 30th it just be the morning service so we have to make those records you know people wonder why we do it and they're they're changing things a little bit and putting some of the old Services now on the on the ability to put on the internet and I don't know why in the world that they chose to do that but they wanted to do it and they wanted to put serieses in and things like that well Richard's having to go through and because but sometimes we we didn't know who was what you know so brother Ray's running the takes and getting them ready and brother Richard's having to to go through and and always write little notes if you seen my thing I have little notes up here and even if I say well okay I want the deacons to say something about the kid behav I'll write a little note here well that's you know it keep up a richer be life because see sometimes I I'll be in the services and I'll I'll I'll just go over one page well then you got to go back up to the top of the next page somewhere to find that next sermon cuz if you don't you're going to go from 12 14 you know or something like that and you're going to be left out but you know we we try to make a little record that's why I keep announcing what I'm saying I keep announcing things to where that they're repetitive and and to that we can keep up with it okay so we're going to turn to Luke 21 and just read a few verses and try to continue our thought that that we had for this morning and we will start with verse 29 through 36 let's pray father we thank you we love you we thank you for your grace and your love thank you for the day that we live truly we thank you for the children that you would put within their hearts that they would sing about you and that they would talk about you and they would say it's the Bible and Lord we just thank you we love you and we commit everything to you Lord that you may have your way with each one of us so you come on the scene and manifest yourself now and let your love abide with each and every one of us you said you sent your word and healed us delivered from destruction so we believe that we' seen you in Mighty ways but we look forward every day to see you again cuz that's why we gather together with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith is to serve our living God who's living among us thank you for all things Lord have your way with each one forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name amen we go to Luke 27 I had this wrong for Joe and we had to get it straight I had him on 21 27 verse 29 and he spake to them a parable Behold a fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth and you see and know your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise listen you when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is now at hand just as well as the weather conditions the kingdom of God is at hand when you see these things coming to pass right verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all be fulfill Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away that's right take heed to yourself lest at any times your hearts be overcharged with spiiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that so that they come on you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of to stand before the son of man that's right am you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we were talking this morning of that these things must come to pass and now this afternoon what we want to do is kind of talk about the things that we miss and it all comes from the point of what we've been talking about of you know heaven and seeing those things and maybe you don't think about it as we do as ministers or something to to uh talk about these things that mean so much to us but you know there's a lot of things that is in the Book of Revelations now the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 and is not seen until Revelations 19:21 that's right now we didn't give the quotes but we'd be glad to find them for you especially there's one on like Feast of the trumpets where brother ROM I believe that's the one where he said is thus sayith the Lord you know but he shows that the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 and not seen until 1921 when you're coming back into the millennial Reign right all right so then we're going to miss all of the things except we're not going to miss the fifth chapter because the fifth chapter is up in heaven right and the prophet said that is the bride in heaven you know and we're priest and kings and things so we won't miss that you know part of it amen but we'll miss all of the wrong things and it it's it's easy sometime to talk about the things that are going to take place but then you have to be able to put things in a category to be able to see things maybe that we'll miss right you know because we don't want to we we want to keep it in the right order but as I said now the bride goes up Revelations 4:1 because that's where John is taken up and she misses those other things that are to take place and people will say and I've had them to question me on that point they said but what about Revelations 10:7 you know well what about it don't you believe that this message now not brother now but don't you believe that this message will go to Israel amen amen sure this is the message of redemption right this message will go to Israel well all right that's Revelation 10 see 1 through 7 as much as it is anything else it doesn't put brother brandom in Revelations 10 like we put him there right cuz if we go up in Revelations you know 41 and we miss these things that will transpire upon Earth after the then surely we ought to be able to to understand that uh there's a lot of those things we miss right amen they don't pertain to us you said what the seals brother the seals are to Israel right they said to brother around said will Thessalonians there about the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God said will that fulfill the first seal he said yes right see the seal is actually to Israel the Revelation is to the bride now we're going to get to it in a minute because we're going to divide between it there's a difference the prophet said and the between the church and the bride right all right now he says there's a difference between so we're going to divide it a little bit when we get over to the point but I want you to think about it see that the things between Revelations 4:1 and 1921 one other than us being up in heaven in chapter 5 that will be to Israel and the things transpiring right but I keep saying it over and over to you see you say but but but brother Dale that's just it's not in the right order brother R said it was right amen he said everything was in order right amen all right so if we look at it correctly and understand then as the bride goes up in the Rapture right and all these other things that we thought we were going to have to have and do you know will be to Israel and then we come back in Millennial right and that's that's that's a wonderful thing you know we miss a lot of bad parts right so what we miss is what we're talking about this evening right but the reason we miss it is because of who we are amen now here's the whole nutshell of what I'm saying see then we were looking up in heaven and seeing these things go across right and we seen the the uh the future home even we seen the Millennium we seen the future home we' seen the things that would be there we saw the uh we didn't cover them as much in detail but we saw the white throne but we seen that we would not be standing before the white Throne you know that we would be sitting on the throne with him amen well you know what that means we miss going to the white drone right right so that's kind of the idea of what I'm talking about so we can look at it and say well look at this look at this morning star singing together sons of God shout it for Joy well you know what that's somebody right right why can't we believe it's us right all right and if we believe it's us you know what we miss all of those things right amen cuz he's already showing us you remember when uh let's see when God came to Abraham he said can I withhold anything from Abraham seeing that he's the heir right so you know what he told him the future y about Israel told him the things that would happen right to Abraham all right so then if he thought that much about that what about you and I right amen now we're going to get down in a minute and and we'll drop down into something something and and all but we're going to be talking about that the bride misses the tribulation because you know she cannot go through the tribulation right and all but we're going to pick up some scriptures that I had seen what the prophet I believe what he was saying about it but it really just begin to unfold a little to where that we could to understand so we'll get to that in a minute but what I want you to think about now if we go up in Revelations 4:1 see that's why it says in Revelations 101 one or 10 10 107 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that's right when he begins to sound see that doesn't put brother random there right neither no more than it puts us there right I've had discussions with ministers about that even though that they'll read what brother random says and it's thus sayth the Lord we go up Revelation 4 but they still say but we got what about that what about you know remember if you're going to put Revelations 10 anything why don't you do what brother Bram done why don't you put it where he said at Revelations 10:1 is the same as Revelations 1113 right that's right which shows the Bride of Jesus Christ but that don't put us there we don't have to go through the tribulation to be able to understand amen do you get it amen amen we get the Revelation amen we get the revelation of what will transpire from here all the way through even till brother randam I I I wrote it down I got it written in the Bible somewhere there but he says he gave an order he said the next is the rapture right he said then the tribulation sits on Israel he said and then there'll be an Armageddon he said then the Millennium will come and he said then after the Millennium said there'll be a little season and he said then there'll be a white Throne judgment and he said then there'll be the future home right well you know what I I love to just sit down and read that one after the other you know right but you know what people are so uh spiritually minded and I'm not throwing no Stones I'm just saying words but brother Rand will be talking and he said if I don't see you anymore I'll see you in the Millennium but next thing is the Millennium look at that look at that look at that next thing is the Millennium he didn't say that but that's what people think you they just change anything to fit anything they want to and that won't work so we go up Revelation 4:1 we miss those things but we get to revelation of what all of that is about that's it amen we know now what Israel will do the two witnesses will come how that that'll take place 144,000 will be called all of those things have already been given to the bride by Revelation right well why can't we believe it that way and see by that then we miss a lot of things we miss a lot of things that we used to think that we're going to get you know all right and see by doing that it's a fulfilling of the scriptures right that must come to pass and it was back there we read it again it shall come to pass when we use must come to pass in the morning and in Luke we read where it must come to or shall come to pass these things thank God that we missed that that that day won't come on us that we'll Escape these things and miss those horrible situations that will come upon the Earth amen you can say well I understand understand we're not going through the tribulation do you really understand it right where is your scripture you know because we taught and basically the whole world system teaches I'm doing religious system teaches that the bride will go through the tribulation right and in the Baptist you got what's called in the Presbyterian I guess and all them got the same but they got a seven-year tribulation they got a 3 and 1/2 years of minor they call it 3 and 1/2 years of major cuz they they didn't want to put us through all of it so bad you know so they came up with a doctrine of seven-year tribulation three and a half minor have major we're here through the minor but not the major amen all right so that's what they you know that's their Doctrine and ideas but now listen see some of the people in this message think that's what brother R was teaching but it was not right he only taught three and a half years tribulation that's right there's only three and a half years for the ministry of Christ CU three and 1/2 years we already back dying all right now but see we to bring it down to seeing it by being in the bride we miss these things that are going to come upon the Earth right to try them right the people that's left all right now watch we get to in a minute you'll see it see by being in the bride of Christ we don't have to go through the tribulation right as I said now most of the religious World believes that we do right Y and some who follow around this message one that had a tent right over here back good many years ago that travels about the country you know he kind of rides a message he believed that we was going to go through the tribulation man down here around Monroe you know these are people are supposed to be in the message or at least around it he believed we've going through he even had the the campgrounds made perfectly far that right some of you know about it some Of You' been there seen but see I'm just doing that not thr own but just to sh you that even people of this message still what they believe right because it's such an old Doctrine you know because it's come all the way down through till you know it it makes it hard to understand the scripture sometimes because of the way that people do all right now we'll read in a minute what the prophet has to say about it but what I want you to see is because if we're part of him you know if you're born again that makes you a child of God y right now we can make carnal excuse me we can make statements that sometimes shows our carnality and uh you know doing things but I like to look at the prophet's message and I like to look at the Bible because I believe that they're saying the same cuz that's where the prophet got it from was the Bible That's Right amen you know and so then what he says has got to be in the Bible or he wasn't a Bible prophet that's right now by doing that then we can quote I mean most people say well well we know that we don't and this quotes it's it's right see Noah wrote over in the ark right that's the tribulation all right but Enoch went up in the Rapture all right those are types and things and those are things that brother random gave that shows the scripture shows that we don't have to go through the tribulation we miss all of these things by being a part of the bride of Christ because listen church not only do we miss these things it's already been revealed to us by the Bible where we're at we're already as far as we do spiritual or think spiritually we resurrect sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right all right then as far as spiritually speaking by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is already in eternity right right by the new birth so that means your soul is already in the Eighth Day by the new birth right all right now the Millennium will be the seventh day right and then the eighth day will be the future home amen or eternity well God's already showed us there cuz he showed a city right right he showed a city coming down right and John is so enthused by looking at the city until when he described it he described it as the bride he's so enthus looking at the bride when he's describing her he's describing the city right come on read Revelation 21:22 when you get time he will be so Inus of describing it until he puts them together and that is together because the city is made according to our desires right right all right the future home as we talk about right so then you can't separate us from that so we're already revealed as being there that's what God thinks about us now we're still here now here's the point I've been trying to get us to do and for all these years for many years talking about matching pieces if we could ever get oursel to the place that we can see ourselves there that's right that's amen then when we see ourselves there it'll just be a matter of him stepping us across amen but that's our problem we're so Earthbound until we're not any good spiritually a lot of time but a lot of people then go off on all these tantrums of doctrines and they're so spiritual minded that they ain't no earthly good you right I I'd rather have a little bit of each one and let it balance out to see what the truth is all right so now we miss the tribulation but now you might not have thought about it like this why is it you miss it he said well because we're this we're that we're the bride of Christ right but put it in the scriptures right and and give the scriptures like the prophet would with Noah going across see riding over through the tribulation Enoch going off in a Rapture before that transpired what's he doing he's tying the Bible together to show us how perfect God sees us now why are we going to miss this Brother Gary why are we going to miss these things and we we hear the prophet and we we but we do we pay that much attention he said no why would you said would you make your wife go through a trial or a test yeah before you married her to see whether she's a good wife or not now that'd be something wouldn't it he said well we got a couple coming up here you know and we tell Mary and I can't never remember his name Michael M Mah but we tell Mary and Mah when they talk about getting M okay so now what's going to have to happen is you're going to have to go through all these test Mary to prove that you're a good wife that's right amen so you got 6 months of this and 6 months of this and 6 months of this and maybe about two or 3 years from now that's right he decided he wanted to marry you amen now would that be something amen that's right that'd be a horrible thing we don't think about what a prophet would be saved we think it is just a a statement but you know what he's doing that Prophet to me now when he makes those type of statements he's taken the entire Bible as a background to show what God thinks of his little bride amen you know the entire Bible is being brought forth in the Bible we read of things that are not that maybe were not too good Paul said it such were some of you right but now you're clean amen that's right cuz that's what God has done that's right but see we don't have to go through the tribulation all right now let's get some quotes from ROM and then we'll we'll get down and and pick up something he said so go ahead brother Jo let's let's look at a few quotes I know you think about these and and you say well now we just we we we've known long time we missed the tribulation but do you know why right if you don't get nothing out of it just remember if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ if you have the new birth today your soul is already Eternal and God cannot lose you because you're his wife and how beautiful he thinks about you and the Book of Revelations was written to show us you remember back how long's it been a year or so ago when I made this statement I said you don't find Jesus in The Book of Revelations by himself he's either with his bride or he's in Bride form or he's with the children of Israel you know in the Redemption form for them he's never shown by itself in the Book of Revelation that meant something to me when the Lord showed me that because I could see what he thought of you and I and that he would tell us the end of the story before the story ever started right amen if the Bible was written before the foundation of the world right then the Book of Revelation was written before the foundation of the world he shows us what he thinks about us M right and because of what he thinks about us we're going to miss a lot of the things that are to come upon the Earth right so let's see what he had to say about it four seal paragraph 107 63 321 how can anybody get to church through the tribulation don't know but what's it got to go through the tribulation far now watch his wording Church bride Church bride a minute what's it got go through the tribulation far and it hasn't got got hasn't got a sin okay I mean the I don't mean the church the church will go through the tribulation but I'm talking about the bride the bride won't know it hasn't got a sin against it at all it's done been bleached out and there's not even a there's not even smell of it there's nothing left they're perfect before God so what's any tribulation to purify them MH but the others do the church does go through the tribulation but not the bride amen we miss the tribulation because being part of God being in his bride all right right so the things that would be in the Bible that would talk about the horrible days that are coming upon us when the the the things will happen to all we think it's bad out here now we think it's horrible now but what about when the wrath of God is poured out because that's the tribulation this is not the wrath of God right this is just Satan and his leading up to that but what about the wrath of God that is poured out upon man until they leaveing the Bible says they pray to die that's right they'll try to hide in the Rocks the dens to get away from it face right well because they realize they missed it right but see you and I are going to be in Rapture Jesus we don't have to go through that amen that's the point I'm want you to look at but get get this now what I want you to see the Book of Revelations 2122 shows us already die the prophet of God would say it and look the basics of the old religious World system as we talking about believe you're going through the tribulation you're com to a little eighth grade education man or seventh and he said give me one scripture that shows the bride will have to go through the tribulation now bud they been they I mean you're talking about one man against the whole religious system that's right back in the days where brother Ram was I remember the the B alone had about 500 million what about all of the millions of millions of religious people and one man standing against it to say show me one scripture what don't you think that left have done it right but you couldn't do it but of course that didn't change their Doctrine that's right why because God didn't reveal it if God don't reveal something to you and I it don't change us oh yeah we might get out of argu right you might ought to argue the person to where that they'll just get to word they won't say nothing while they around you right but you're not going to change their Doctrine right I'm not trying to convert anybody God has to do the converting look at the next one God hiding in Simplicity in Albuquerque New Mexico no good teacher I like that believes that the church the bride the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through for purification you're under the six seal watch it right Israel does the same thing for the 144,000 but not the bride there the bride is Forgiven she goes straight to glory in her in a Rapture that's right see my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you wouldn't even you wouldn't wouldn't know nothing about it remember it's a secret secret catching away you come in an hour that you think not you won't know nothing about it she'll be gone be too late then that's right she's not going to have to go through it why because she's already forgiven like I said you mean you put your wife to a test before you'd marry her you know I'll give you 6 months now to prove I I used to I won't say where it was at cuz I'm trying to get a little better about it but this one man I heard in preacher he said he out in a certain area that a lot of people are didn't have inside Plumbing you know bathrooms and things in the houses they and Johnny houses and uh ain't nothing wrong with that cuz I was born and raised anyway but if if you can do better now here's my point and I heard this man personally say he said we moved out there and was living there and he was a preacher and he said my wife is proved to stand the test said I'm going to move her into a house where we got indoor plumbing she stood the T she washed out there and beat herself to death for no telling how long right I call it sorry but I don't I try to be nicer but you mean you make your wife especially when she's already covered by the blood now here's the way I am in plain language to you wife or husband all right or who if I ask you to forgive me and you say you forgive me right then I don't want to hear that no more right amen that's right right amen I say it's a sorry husband or a sorry wife both either One MH that would say if their husband asked them to forgive them their wife asked to forgive them for what they have done and they say I for forgive you now God takes your word and you're bound by it you ever bring that up again you are sorry low down hypocrite as far as I'm concerned worse than anything I can think of because you're bringing out from under the blood something's been put under the blood hey we're human we can't forget but we can keep our mouth shut and our attitude around people that's right I've had people to do things against me and they'd say forgive me and I say you're forgiven and that'll never be brought up again and you know what when I get around them I won't shy around you know I don't want to fool with you cuz you done me wrong one time now I know what the Bible says a heretic after the first and second order you count them not as a brother M so if you do it again to them in the same thing and I going tell you I forgive you but I ain't going to count you as brother if men on that's Bible right all right that's plain I Know a Man one time years ago and he run his wife off because she had done something wrong and I was there we went through exactly the way brother R we went the man came to the woman was there they confess everything the man told him right there in front of me and everybody he said I forgive you but he never would forget it he won't forget it till this day you talk to him 10 minutes he's going to be bringing it up that man knows what I done told him right I told him just what I told you you're a hypocrite when you say you'll forgive somebody and then you won't oh I'll forgive them just let them ask me the Bible don't say that right the Bible don't say forgive them if they ask if you're a Christian you forgive that's right sure we can't forget right but we forgive no matter if they ask or not cuz you see that's what God does right he's forgive us that's why the Bible said the Bible said how can you for how can he forgive you if you won't forgive somebody else well let him ask me I'll forget see that's not what the Bible says now right you people say to me say brother Dale I'm sorry what it said you never done it anyway I forgive you when you first Di and that's true and I never let it stand between see so just remember that's the way brother Dale thinks about forgiveness cuz that's maybe strong but it's right all right go to the next one brother Joe we didn't get that one on God in Simplicity did we 30:5 did we get through reading that one oh yeah okay go straight to glory and R okay number 8 paragraph 87 conferences 1963 603 it's just part of the doing but what and the sixth one is the purification of the church the church of course goes through the tribulation period for purifying but the bride is raptured is the difference between the bride and the church amen the bride is raptured the church has to go through tribulation for purification amen all right which one do we want to be a part of going to the next one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 251 63627 but this is the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit moving among his people doing the same thing he did when he was here on the earth identifying himself with his bride not the church there's a difference between the church in the bride not preaching Doctrine because I don't do that but to my humble belief the bride goes through this or the the church goes through the tribulation the sick seal are purify that's right but the bride don't she goes in the Rapture before that it's time for the bride to be called out so now I believe it's the calling out time there's a difference between the bride and the church the church goes through the tribulation right now brother Brown a lot of times we'll just use the word church you be using the word church talking about the bride cuz we are the church church means called out but now he's distinguishing to tell you a difference between the church and the bride and what's the difference the church will go through the tribulation but the bride goes in Rapture before the tribulation right go on to the next one perseverance paragraph 3563 802 now I'm not here preaching Doctrine cuz this was out not at the Tabernacle there is ministers on the platform here that would disagree probably with this most all ministers believe that the church goes through the tribulation period for purification I can't see it the blood of Jesus Christ is our purification nothing cleaner see see I believe that the church the denominational church and the sleeping virgins goes through the ration but not the bride there is a difference between the church and the bride the bride goes into the Rapture that's where you Church of God of Anderson all got mixed up there see is in that all right now going down to the next one how can I overcome paragraph 6 55 63825 the morning service but I can't agree with him cuz I don't see it but it doesn't pertain to Sal salvation that pertains to the coming of the Lord he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purified the church see it's not no I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period Church organization but the bride does not would you choose a woman you had to would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her see Christ's bride is chosen and she is elected she is God's bride the Bride of Jesus Christ let's get to the last one and then we'll we'll have it which goes on down paragraph 55 and paragraph 56 he that believeth on me see right as G she she has no purification uh let me back up read the and now he said how you going to type that and this is a brother talking to a man if that bride Goes Forth goes up before she goes through the tribulation said I got scripture that shows you the church is in the tribulation period now he just said I gave you the quote that most ministers believed that the church would go through the tribulation he's talking to someone and I could probably name this one because I know that he had discussion he said that that was the difference he had with the brother about it right right I said just read the six seal that's all she is right there under the tribulation period see that's where the man thought it was all but find out just before that the bride is done gone yep see there's somebody under the six seal right there's a church but not the bride she done goone word revelation 4:1 she's in glory at the time she has no purification he that believeth in me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or the Judgment but has passed from death and to life Christ gave the promise that we would not even stand it to judgment so freely did he take my place until I'm absolutely free when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned right how can he take me out of the pawn shop got a clean receipt yeah how can he be my redeemer and take me from the p take me from the pun shop and the broker still say I belong to him I got a written receipt amen see wrot by the blood of Jesus Christ now in that here is where we come now watch we're going to get to something right here cuz I didn't choose to bring the rest of it but now here's my written receipt right anybody on tell can see I'm holding up the Bible the Bible is my written receipt that I don't have to be in the pawn shop right that God paid my price y that's right I don't have to be there right I'm purified why would you have all the scriptures and the things about the bride and how beautiful she is if you're going to make her go through the tribulation why would you have that so watch what he said now how are you going to get separate that electric bride you talk about now how are you going to put that under a top and the man ask brother random how you going to put it under a tie and you know what he told him to get so let's turn over there and read it well brother Joe's going to pull it up he told him he said let's go to Matthew 27 right and watch and behold the veil of the temple was R in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slep arose and came out of the Grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now that's the scripture he gave can you look at that scripture and see that the bride don't have to go through the tribulation I'm just asking you can you look at it that's reason I chose not to use the rest of the quote part you go into that message and read the rest of it and see what he said but can you really look at that scripture and say the bride don't have to go through the tribulation because Matthew 27 51-53 says it okay and behold the veil of the temple was rent in Twain from top to the bottom and the Earth did Quake the Rocks rent now what was that that was at his resurrection right now brother random if you reading go on down below where this is at you see him say see the law was done away when the veil was rent right Jesus Christ rose from the dead this thing was happening it was ending the law right now law is man's carnality of reading y Paul thought it was spiritual right right but it was death he said what was death when when the law was the word of God that's right but it was Paul's interpretation of the law or thoughts of the law see the law ended when Jesus Christ rose from the dead but he paid the price right now it ended in one point what it ended the letter of the word that kth because it made a way for a new birth and that would be then the Bible would say that Christ then is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe you ever heard a good Baptist preach that he preached it when the Resurrection come the law ended y so we can't be condemned by the law anymore I can live anything I want to cuz there's no law you ain't never heard him preach now but Jesus come to magnify the law right that's what he said about now right he come to make it honorable right see the law never ended people are say today we're not under the law unless you're borned again right you're still under the law cuz the law is carnal Commandments right amen but brother today we're in the New Testament you're not in the New Testament without the New Birth the new birth came on the day of Pentecost right if you have the new birth you're in the New Testament right if you don't have the new birth you're still under the law LA right right come on you don't hear people talk like that do you because they don't like that we're under grace work the only way you're under grace is because you're born again right right that's right Christ ended the law for righteousness for them that believe amen right people are going to be condemned by the law to why thr judment but that we miss come on I hope you're following what I'm saying if you're not born again if I'm not born again today I'm still under the law that's right the same law that David gave we don't give we don't do sacrifices No More Jesus Christ is My Sacrifice don't go with the carnality that's right Jesus Christ become my sacrifice but if I don't have the life of the one that paid the price I've only got a man dying right now come on is that what they preach in River Jordan just a man died y do you still under the law right no no no we're in the New Testament cuz it says it right here then you ask people say well what's the first book of the New Testament they'll turn to Matthew that's right is that true that's not the first book of the New Testament I don't care what you got written in your Bible somebody wrote that on there the book of Acts is the New Testament the New Testament was not enforced Matthew Mark Luke and John Jesus is say the other day came under the law to redeem them that were under the law amen he would even tell them under Matthew Mark Luke and John go make the sacrifice with m but where do you hear it after the day of Pentecost y there no sacrifice of Moses after the Pentecost right amen but you say well I what do you mean brother I I read right it says right there in my Bible right right right there look at it you it's a new testament that's not here on this one we're not under the Old Testament I show me how you got from under it how did you get out from under the Old Testament see these are the things we missed that we thought we believe to be true we miss a lot of things by being the Bride of Jesus Christ that we thought to be true why do you think people thinks they have to go through the tribulation cuz they don't believe that they're pure and if you don't believe you're pure you're not pure right that's right if you don't believe that you're pure you're not pure you're under the tribulation and will go through the tribulation unless you're born again only the Born Again people will miss the tribulation right we're not in the New Testament just because it that we could read out of some book the Old Testament never ended at Calvary like we think it ended right it ended only for the born the person who would go to Pentecost and receive the new birth right the world is still under the Ten Commandments and not only that it's worse because the Ten Commandments have been magnified Y come on Jesus said you heard it old th shalt not commit adultery but I say unto thee to look on a woman with lust in your heart you've committed adultery already he magnified the law right that's what Paul was saying he said I thought this that I read that I kept and didn't do or done was my life was giving me eternal life he he said I found it to be my death he said but then I found Christ right Christ is the end of the law then but I don't have to go through the tribulation pull that quote back up brother Joe CU we want to dwell on that minut so then what happened the prophet says he said give me a typ he said your's your typ yep evidently the man didn't care for him using the one of Noah that's good enough for me wouldn't you right and brother Ram said cuz I remember when I first saw that he said Noah rose up went over come back down died a drunk he said but Enoch went into Rapture y he said see there the bride don't have to go through the tribulation now listen Church the reason you don't have to go through the tribulation cuz you can turn right over here and read you're already there yeah right you turn over here if you want to know what God thinks about you turn over Revelation 21:22 and read it if you want to see yourself already now read it cuz it tell somebody it's going to be there why can't we believe it's us am amen but now where we at we're still on this now here's his proof because when the law ended it didn't end just a letter right right when the law ended now catch this it didn't end just a letter something took place to prove before even the day of Pentecost that the bride wouldn't going to have to go through the tribulation something took place but took place when the law ended Christ stepped on the scene right right and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many y you say but brother dor that's the Old Testament people I'm glad you thought of that cuz that's exactly right right but what's your thinking well that's just the Old Testament science now would that not be the Bride of Jehovah are you with me yes come on do I need the quotes to bring where brother R said Jehovah had a bride Jesus had a bride yep yep right do I have to prove that and go over and over it or do you understand it the Old Testament people was Jehovah's bride right they were the ones that raised this is not a new testament Resurrection he's given you the Old Testament Resurrection but giv it to you to prove go read the rest of that quote he's given it to you to prove that the bride don't go through the tribulation that's his scripture because if God thought enough of the Bride the Old Testament to raise her before the tribulation don't you know for sure that he's going to raise his bride come on Church don't you know for sure that he's going to raise his bride before the tribulation Jehovah's bride never went through won't go through the tribulation that way now the 144,000 things over here won't be Jehovah's bride so don't think he can catch us 144,000 will not be Jehovah's bride I know some people in this message that preach it will be yep but they can't be because they're servants that's right brother R said what they're going to be in the Millennium about page 14 or somewhere in our first first few pages of the church age book he said they'll be in the millennial Reign he said but they'll be our servants right they will never be able to come forth as Jehovah's bride because they rejected it right y so then the prophet's perfectly right the Old Testament Saints raises and went up to the city before the tribulation never takes place you see why he's using that scripture evidently that man that he was talking to that he said I know he don't agree with me evidently that man didn't get it by seeing that Noah went up over but Enoch went into Rapture brother R said there's not one scripture the man had just got through saying to brother brandom we read in a quote he said brother brand I got quote I got scripture that says a bride will go through the tribulation brother around said ain't no scripture so whatever the man had wouldn't be right it was man's carnality placed in some form of a scripture cuz the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of the Jehovah she don't have to come forth she's already come forth to prove it that she don't go through the tribulation we don't have to go through the tribulation either why because we're born again Christians we are the bride ofes Jesus Christ so we don't have to go through it we've done missed it by being born again you miss the tribulation right by being born again you miss having to stand before the white Throne judgment by being born again we miss Armageddon the great horrible things that are going to happen in the tribulation of being born again no wonder that brother around said that baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important part thing of your life right whether you got it or not don't Dilly Around Church find out whether you got it or not I would to God that I could preach to this church so hard until everybody in here one 100 of us or how many they are now of us that never everybody in here would find out they wern't born again if that's the way it is cuz then you could do something about it then you'd start seeking God but what's so hard to try to preach to his people says I got it I got it the reason I got it I know I got it cuz I believe the prophet well the devil got it he believes a prophet now where you going to put yourself that's right that's why I love the prophet's message cuz it's in the Bible right the bride don't go through the tribulation because Jehovah's bride don't go through the tribulation that's what he said see that's scripture for when are we going to believe what God says Revelations 3:10 brother Joe pull it look what it says about this this is in the church age book right this I mean the church Age series right because thou H has kept the word of my patience I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth Yep the things we miss are being part of the bride of Christ look what so much he thinks of US 1 Corinthians 63 know ye not that you shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life by being the Bride of Jesus Christ we're going to judge Angels right they'll have to stand before us and be judged we don't have to go to the white Throne we set on the white throne right what an honor it is read the book of Revelations we gave it the other day and read the book of Daniel Daniel 7 and see that those books were open amen and that we sit on the throne with him judging others it won't be a fact that we'll set up there as prow boastful right no it' be an honor Amen to sit there you know right being honored to know the judge I remember some people used to go to church here that daughter got a ticket and I won't call her names but the daughter got a ticket policeman you know so she had to go to court well she was scared to death you know like any young girl was you know kind of worried but but when they walked in her and her daddy walked in you know to stand before the judge judge looked down and say well hello there and called his name she said I felt good she said cuz I figured the case would already closed cuz the judge knows my daddy you know well that's a good illustration right but what about what the prophet give that's right when the judge the jury and he said even the prosecutor amen is on your side that's right you know there'll come a time when we stand there and sit with him that Satan can't even Point his accusing finger amen he can't Point his finger at us cuz God says no all over with Bible says he's up there right now accusing the Brethren right but till come a day he can't do that right and it'll be the day when the bride realizes who she is amen that's right and the purpose we're here on Earth right is to believe God's word amen and to take his word and stand on it amen but you see we don't have to go through those horrible things that you read of in the Book of Revelation why because you turn on over to the back of the book and just read she's already there m m that's right like the prophet said then you don't have no scripture for the bride going through the tribulation amen the church yes he said y she has to go for the purification was it not the bride said she's already pure and the last thought I wrote down look what it means to be the bride of Christ and see the book that was opened and how it revealed all of these things to us y truly it is an open book that's right Search the book you know I read in this book that I'm just as perfect as he is right amen that's right you know that by being born again you miss going to hell am that's right you know that by being born again somebody's going to miss dying amen right why can't I believe that I'm one of them I'm getting too old to not believe it brother said the other day 80 years old he said said people was preaching this message he said somebody said to him and said man you're 80 years old he said so what y for long I won't be with God one way or the other either because I'm dying a old age or because I'm going to be raptured well that's a good point amen why AR we worried that's right amen I've done read the book amen amen I told you how I used to make my book reports i' read the introduction to get who the who they was and then i' read the last page of the book John and Mary lived happily ever after and I wrote some of the funn stories probably about John and Mary that never even was in print nowhere but you don't want I to get a good grade out of it until he found out I was copied my sister's reports then the teacher got on to it listen Church the things that must come to pass is said in the Bible right that's right but the same Bible that tells us what must come to pass the B you know the things the same Bible tells us how beautiful it is to be his children that's right amen yes sir that we don't have to go through these things we don't have to go around every day with our old wrong face amen down in that attitude do we I TR we don't have to me I'm happy a't you amen I'm happy that God has given me eternal life but you know what I'm happy that he's revealed his word to me amen now I don't have to worry about where I'm taking a man now listen to me and you listen good most of the people this message is based upon what a man says yep that's ex right amen you said bless God that's where I want to be can you show that that man where he told you in the Bible where he got what he's talking about right right now I can be happy amen I
