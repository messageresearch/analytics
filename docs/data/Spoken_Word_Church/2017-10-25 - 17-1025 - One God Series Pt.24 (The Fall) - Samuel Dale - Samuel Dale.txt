house of the Lord all right now we're gonna try to pick up where we left off Sunday so it's gonna have to go a little this way and then back that away so just bear with me I won't get right to the exact point until maybe on into the last of the message but I'm wanting you to get a point is the time and the Prophet said when you take something said hold it up for the people until they see it he said didn't move on well that's that's what we try to do right so let's do that father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you Lord that you are God and you change not thank you for everything father thank you for the people that's gathered tonight and we pray that you would bless each one as we are all Lord come dark together in our little licks of fire to be able to bind together and fight the enemy and all of his things and the ways of his doing they ask you to bless each one bless those that are watching on internet Lord and just have your way with ever better the little pieces that we have to do with the Bride of Christ around the world we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and guide us in Jesus name Amen so we've been in John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and him was life and the life was the light of men the light shyness and darkness the darkness comprehended it not see when I started series I take a scripture and people wonder why that you know this makes twenty-five times I think reading John 1:1 but that's the point I'm still on the Godhead still only being revealed you know I'm going through so I just read the same Scripture yeah I hope it doesn't get boring to you for me to read that same one scriptures you know throughout the whole series I haven't preached 70 or 80 services and read one scripture well I hope we got it you know at least we tried any will have okay let's go to Genesis 1 now to 26 but we're going on into verse 28 that will tie into the message and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them and what he saying to him multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it that's what he told them to do and how do mean you know the efficacy you know over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of his word as I said we're trying to just follow in the thought and we're coming down and we we went backs and some of you missed some of parts of it we went back before the foundational world coming down trying to show the condescending of God in how he would come down to earth and then got through into the parts you know of studying what happened and all of the scriptures and how they tied together and then we begin to talk about mankind and seeing him and seeing God bringing us into being all right so now this last couple of services has been falling on the line of the creation especially the last one there Sunday talking about the creation and I want the main point and I've always tried to get that main point over that God cannot create anything wrong now that's that should be solved you said what I think so that ain't got nothing to do with it you need to spit that thing out of your thoughts that you could think something other than the fact of one time God cannot create anything wrong well now God's God he can do what he wants to see that's how we go in our human mentality and when we do we get so bound up and you'll see when we get maybe maybe not tonight but maybe Sunday coming in with it of unbelief unbelief see and that's what we're doing we're just believing God's Word to see when we have our own ideas our own thoughts and concepts that are contrary to God's Word in other words I don't care what you would think off I'm gonna send it straight this is the way I am the way I always talking we're preach God cannot create anything wrong then you come along and try to prop up some little wool he done this over here and he done this over here and he done it over there what are you trying to do try to show how smart you are or what you find out that's exactly what the devil was doing in the garden because if you don't get nothing out of the message to not remember one thing whatever the original sin was still is and Satan's tactics of using and doing is identically the same today as it was back dark so then that solves the problem like I said then you say well what I think is the it's not God cannot create anything wrong or would he get the material to create something wrong all of God's creation is perfect you see then you taking that's what the people do we'll try to get more into it see this ever but he created the woman did he create the woman in any way with any form thoughts ideas I wrote was there any defect in the creating of Eve comparing it to the creation of Adam remember she come from Adam if you think and try to figure out any defect you know what I mean by that any way that it would have been made to make man fall other than a free moral agency you're going to the basis of Satan's lie and he's still telling you the same thing he told Eve in the garden so just remember whatever the original scene was the original sim still has they then that order solved the problem in our thinking all right are we looking as I said for some way are we trying in some way to figure out something wrong with Eve that made her to the basis that she would do wrong you ought to remember one thing everything physical that was in Eve was in Adam to start with is that enough everything so now how can you make a defect maybe that's the wrong words to use those early human ways but it's all I know if there's anything wrong in the way that Eve was created then God could not judge her for being wrong that order solve a problem in order to stop us from any of those little bitty yeah but I think she was doing which I think she was suggesting she me you're trying to do the same thing that was done in the garden all right Eve was created a byproduct remember what a byproduct is a by-product is from an original creation in other words it was taken from we try to illustrate the cars and everything but that doesn't even work in the kingdom Oh in the gospel see because he was literally bone Adam said of my bone in flesh of my flesh then if that's true then there was no defects in whatever was made in order to get that out of our mind of something that we think and I will hope you listen you know if you miss the services I hope you go back and that's what we make the tapes for to listen to them I listen to the services when I have to miss or something was wrong and I listen back over to the services every Sunday because I want to hear and see and try to understand what we're trying to do and if you miss the service then then you know you need to go back to listen to what you missed yeah well I ain't got time how many hours are the in the day and how many days are in a week and how many times he you're playing in the game the Adam and Eve in the garden and the devil in his - and okay now but listen even everything no matter what animal that you make you don't like the snake he don't make no difference he was created in his original creation it's perfect yes could ever be made and for that reason did we don't you know you want to make this you want to make that no just make it to be one thing God cannot create anything wrong and say thank you lord the because if he could create anything wrong he could judge it you know I mean how could he judge it for being wrong it'd be his fault all right now I hope you would listen as I said to Sunday's evenings message because the pointed I'm driving is remember whatever you're talking about Eve you remember Sunday after Sunday morning service whatever you're talking about Eve her creation are doing whatever is speaking of the Bride of Christ right now whatever you do and you're throwing it to the bride across because she is to be that female and be the same as Eve was she's the Bride of Christ well she went out doing this one huh yeah but did he make her that away no he did all right now let's start then and we'll back up a little come down to that at the end and type together into what we were talking about Sunday but if you went anywhere today and asked in the religious room and you would ask the people what was the original fall what was the original happening in the garden all right they give you a definition of something maybe eating an apple because they can read literal words and see that it was some kind of fruit but they won't have anything to do with the real understanding of what happened right they'll give you a definition of the fall because they realize we did fall all right come down to the believers of the message the end time believers and you ask them and most of them will say it was an act between Eve and the Beast and they'll bring that is there some ation of what you would ask him about the fall now we say well we know that it's not right about the original sin has to be eating an apple we know that's not right but then we will lay heavily on the fact of talking about an act between Eve and the Beast but what would be the original sin what if it would be eating apples or pears or a night between even the Beast when those are attributes of unbelief all right are you gonna follow me now those are not sin remember brother branham preaching that time and preaching real hard you know talking about it wouldn't him sin to smoke it wouldn't send the drank it wouldn't send it of course it wasn't sin and this lady raised her hand and said price sir would you tell me what was the thin he said unbelief now which came first the unbelief or the app whether you want to talk about eating an apple a pyre or pomegranate either whatever you want to talk about which one came first it would have had to been first a spiritual thought our condition to exist and then whatever act is you want to put with it would come with that all right so remember you're dealing with attributes when you talk about anything that you think Eve done all of that is attributes of unbelief so then we know the prophets right in what he's saying let's eat tell me your people in I've you know we've been around enough coming to Methodists Baptists and I they'll talk with you about the original sin is being unbelief because some of them told it is unbelief they'll tell you in a hurry that don't matter what it was is this just unbelief well why shouldn't it be the us come down to that very point and say like brother Branham does on all things are possible them that believe the first original sin was because Eve doubted the Word of God so what was the original sin sirs we would see Jesus unbelief is the original sin unbelief see we we take sin has to be what we do well it wouldn't be no difference in arguing apple an orange whatever anything out see you're talking about a display but remember unbelief is first then we reach some from the Prophet where he didn't doubt God as being God rah but she didn't believe he'd keep his word so what is the original sin when the queen of the south the Prophet said really unbelief is the only sin see there there is no sin outside of unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already see then unbelief being the original sin we deal with what happens within that RIM instead of thinking of the unbelief we do want to think about us being unbelievers right unbelief Christ mister of God revealed what killed Eve the Prophet said unbelief she disbelieved God's Word right see we can get in all and we'll deal more Sunday with more into the reasoning factors of mankind but we're just wanting to talk about it I am tonight a little bit about the fall being unbelief see that at I ever Scripture in the Bible together as to the original sin all right then you should see what I say at the statement I make whatever the original sin was it still is right they still same unbelief no bro today we're believers all right the Prophet said he Eve was a good believer he said she didn't know why doubt they wouldn't know God did she believed in God but said she didn't believe he keep his word truth in what has destroyed mankind and what's killing today every death you see everything happening what is that because of that's an attribute of unbelief everything that happens it's an attribute from unbelief so the original sin was not an act or a happening or an apple or anything you'd want to label it Eve had to first receive in her mind she conceived in her mind you can call it spirit being you can go whatever you want to label your thoughts you can she had to first receive Satan's lie then what was Satan's lie what was the story back there in the garden that we talk about Satan wanted an inroad into the human race true it was trying he was trying to find some way all right I was just looking at him a moment ago he could not create but he can pervert what God creates so he couldn't create in any way and bring himself into the human race he couldn't do that but he saw that there was one little thing way out little way that he could enter the human race and that would be to try to enter by using some of the form then God's original plan and he saw the beast in height would mingle and what would take place remember right around the city even had a knowledge of the principles of life Satan is very shrewd it's not he's not a dummy he knew exactly what he was doing but listen he's using the same tactics today I got these all here if you want and when you won't raise your hand the same tactics he used on Eve he's using the same thing today you know why he's using it like that because he knows it'll work there was no other plan could be broke Satan was so smart he knew what to do and he ain't change that it's still working come on church we get it to disbelieve in God's Word and we'll see why everything today and now it's falling apart because it's working Satan's getting his way see Eve listened to Satan instead of listening to God then we know the literal act applies but now what was that part we'll get a little bit hearing and pick it up later in the message she listened to it now first off just covered a little bit up in the garden and getting them done first all he began to reason with her and she got into her reason abilities and and she got into her position to work that she was preaching to the devil she was the first original woman preacher right now come on it's huge breaks into the devil well because he comes to hurry look and he says oh there's a beautiful garden in here all these trees in the time and said we can defeat of any of these trees and our God has made for us and he's given us this beautiful garden and said we can eat of any of it now he'd done that deliberately he wouldn't know idiot he was bringing her into the position that he wanted her and what did she say let me straighten you out on that we can eat I've ever read this in the garden but said now there's one tree we can't eat other and said that's that tree of knowledge of good and evil and Satan says will now remember you you get the story that's why I said we're trying to lay out a little bit remember the Beast is the one talking to Eve no Ryan it ain't no devil up in the tree right it ain't no snake running around she found somebody she could communicate with she couldn't talk to the other animals because they couldn't talk back to her the Beast was the one that was talking so we look at it it's the devil talking he was through the Beast right so remember so the Beast is saying can we eat it be near these trees oh let me show you and they give you a secret that you don't know did we can eat of all the trees we said now this one tree we can't eat the her preaching was what put her in the wrong line that's why she's not allowed to pull up here one go Satan could get to her and you can still preach him all right but standing there talking to this beast and the Beast says now look what's the problem with the fact that you can't eat now listen remember there was two trees in the garden now there's a whole garden full of trees but there was two trees in a garden and I'm quoting brother branham right when I was a tree of knowledge of good and evil the other ones of the Tree of Life which is Jesus Christ see the beast was saying you mean we can eat any of them with that one said what about this beautiful one over here he says we can eat at that one so he begins to talk too early said well what's wrong with eating this one and she says well I really don't know did is something wrong right here said I was just told that I could eat of every tree go back in Genesis read your Bible and read it and see that I was told by Adam because that would have been the one who've been talking to her their communication which would have been God through Adam no problem right then I was told that we could eat of all the trees with that one we said he didn't explain it to me he said you're poor I'm quoting red right he said your poor little illiterate person did you know that you was made for this I'm quoting brother branham looking at him you want me to read him did you was made for this purpose now listen what was the devil talking through the words of the Beast come on and I'm quoting brother Branham that's what took place so he says he was made for this purpose you was made to be a mother who said they told you that and you know what she was made to be a mother that was her purpose you need him for brother Branham we read around and said she would have brought forth that child that it not got mixed up he said cause that was the commission from God and that's why we read Genesis 1:28 they were told to multiply and replenish the earth but around said she would have finally brought forth that child you said well was it Christ or was it seed ours were you getting you get and that Satan's waiting on your mind then to open up and see then you own when now he don't know what he's talking about because see that didn't anybody bid me in the devil still talking to you brother don't you know what he'd uses a lot of preachers in the pulpit do a lot of talking to but think about it if the original sin was unbelief where was the problem when God had already told him it was a commission set forth and they were made for that purpose she was made for the purpose of being a mother you know already told to multiply and replenish so don't you see what she was telling the beast but I don't understand I don't understand my part could I know I was dire when God said to multiply and replenish I heard that because that was when they were back in theophany in original creation all right she said but I don't understand he said well all you got to do is just listen and I'll explain it to you and he proceeded to explain listen not a sex act there's were the people of the message really they him are good about dad they know all about the Serpent's seat it was not a sex act he's trying to explain it was her ability to be in mother it would her ability to multiply in replenish come on see we look at it in a sex act we look at it and if we look at it as some kind of a date right now you call that worthy you put a little stuff in the drinks and the things you know and it causes these things to happen don't even think about that he was telling her how to fulfill Genesis 1:28 and that she was going to have a part to do in that and she said remember not around and said she was seeking wisdom he said that was her trouble said if she did this that turned around her husband come on if she did this turned around when all this was transpiring and walked over her to her husband and said explain this to me they would have never been a fallen condition huh but she didn't won't tell him she's already got the taste of what it was known to have wisdom he said Winston yeah because what did the bee say to Eve the God knows the day you eat thereof you'll be and look at your spelling in that it's a little bit eg OD s did you'll be as God's knowing good and evil you'll know good and evil now they don't let you know who's talking because God now listen to the word 13 God doesn't know good and evil oh but I've got a bob wolf girl you know you go ahead I know where your scriptures that God said I know good and evil and even said I created evil now go ahead see that you're gonna get your smart wisdom involved instead of listening to the statement that I made to start with you remember what I said I said you go into unbelief with what was the statement to start with God can't create anything wrong so how could God create what does that mean when he said I create good and evil come on well he created it you see where you're getting in the Satan's trap and not listening you momentarily agreed while ago that God could not create evil now are you breaking down from that and trying to figure out how he can manipulate things God don't create evil he permits evil to come into existence he doesn't create it so when he's talking about knowing it or even using the word create he's not talking about creating it he's talking about allowing it to be done like I asked the other day why wouldn't it have been that God would have just allowed this to come without a devil and all the temptations what did that look better than the way it is now no because he could not display all of his attributes in listen instead of Eve going back to her husband and saying honey explain that to me come on you're gonna get upset with this one so blowy stack and go like this you know it all blowed out you see cause the church ain't gonna listen to God speaking to them today that original sin is still here you gonna say I can get it myself I didn't write the book I didn't write the five fold ministry which for the perfecting of the science but I've heard that definition defined in many many different ways but it comes right back to one time the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the same do you believe that that's the Word of God now I've always told you when I say that one thing and what does it say I agree that the biggest portion of preachers of this message I ain't gonna sit and listen to because they're not trying to perfect the Saints they're trying to destroy the Saints well you think here's what no I've just met I just stopped playing if I got the Bible to read it I just read the Bible yeah but don't you think this oh here you'll see there is your reasoning I told you the star wasn't there whatever was the original sin whatever was the original doing we've got away from it being eaten an apple we got away from it being a setback we got it down we still ain't got that far yet we're still in the basis of even her wisdom and her knowledge and understanding and Satan coming through that room to be able to pervert the church now come on church you think it can't be done I've had to argue with ministers in this message even here in this church about one thing brother Brennan said that little bride went to Nicaea Rome said she should not have went oh I heard definitions they went down there and found out what's wrong and they run back I don't doubt it but you don't want they brought it back that little idea between those two guys that they were arguing over it the first Nazi encounter it is arguing over where Jesus was Almighty God or whether it was a demon God coming into effect which means a lesser God or God in another form or lesser that Jesus was a lesser God and that started your Trinity but the pride went right down to Nicaea and brought that back with her I didn't write the book you want to go through the spoken word I'm just going through a little of it yesterday you want to go through the spoken word where brother Brennan said Adams bride failed but not believe in God's Word he said jehovah's bride fell by not believing God's word he said in Jesus's bride failed by not staying with the word now that's your prophet talking but I just don't think they got into bed wrong they got into wrong enough to they lost they lost this right here this teaching of the stature of a perfect man they lost it they come out with a Trinity Martin Luther was a trinitarian John Wesley a Trinitarian Pentecostal beginnings of Azusa Street was trinitarianism you got to get over about 1914 and all to get the one that started then you got to come home to word can pick up the name of Jesus through that you say oh well we can't be deceived I've got the quote part we can't be deceived we can never be deceived enough to be lost if we're truly born again but if we're truly born again what are we playing with the wrong time why are we in the garden trying to tell the beast oh I don't understand that do you understand one thing why are we still thinking that we can figure this thing out for ourselves why have we been here 50 years talk all you want I said it 50 years ago and I still say it today you know what the problem is me in you well we use a lot of types and shatters don't with Moses went down to Egypt to get the children of Israel take him out he couldn't do it he had to wait 40 years till God had to come on the scene mighty ways to bring him out who's God waiting on the people whose God been waiting on in these last days the people to believe his word my brother I got right now there's the one thing that your prophet tells you in a hurry that that's the wrong attitude we don't have no rocks we are sheep they do not have a right to believe what we want to believe and what's wrong with it's not believing it the way God says it still in the mind of Eve talking right in the devil telling her you was made you was made different than Adam he was very different he said look I hear in the animal kingdom I said look look at the female they know their purpose in time this is what you don't know you're Adams kept that from you if she was made to be a woman I told you son dealer to me now you come and do whatever you want to we'll talk all you want to talk well we're gonna come back in one statement she was made to be a woman anything else you add into that is going to be your hypothetical when you call those big o words so nice not possessor know what it is and then word your assumptions and your ideas and your thoughts because if you do with any other thing than the fact that she was made of feminists that's natural we know that happened and that feminist part goes to the mother she was born in a way every little girl she plays with her dolls no we've got him nowadays until we kept on and kept on and kept on and now the kids don't know which side to play with and they don't know what kind of toys to buy but I'll tell you one thing you do if you'll just listen and do it let that get kid get about two years old and turn them loose in a store because they ain't got trained yet the people think got it all messed up yet in their mind you're given by two years old you turn that little girl loose you hear that doll this is straight as can be you turn that little boy loose he'll head to that car you ain't never seen you old little boys out in the yard why does it little boy take a car go ain't never drove a car he don't know what it's all about but he rode him little Lin if you'd have been back in our day you know what we had to play with we took a can lad you know the inner part and drove a nail into a stick and we like that was our little cars because we didn't have nothing else I hope you get what I mean after two or three years of age and things start manipulating and changing and doing and you're responsible to raise them children rock what am I gonna tell my kid not told you Sunday just listening you don't screaming holler that little girl don't you play with them toys like that we're boys don't worry about it just let them be a little girl I just put a little doll in the bedroom with a map y'all made to be a mother what was the difference in Eve's and Adam Adam was made to be a man Eve was made to be a woman now you tell me any other characteristics are defects that is brought upon that and trying to convince me of the the things of this and that the hot natures and the things and you getting all of your doings just start him off as a baby and listen with that beast he kept talking and he said this tree of knowledge that's a funny-looking tree in I mean whether you want to call it a power peach or whatever he's a funny-looking tree because the Bible does it it's listed two times I fight for the tree of knowledge what kind of tree is that what kind of tree is the tree of knowledge we used to tell the kids all about that we had a tree that grows persimmons and you could eat them so one day we was walking through the woods it was real early in the year and they said daddy what kind of tree is that I said that's a personal injury that is that the kind you said we could eat I said help yourself they wouldn't write yet so you know I'm talking about a real bitter but when they bit down and spitting and throw it at me I said I tell you one thing you got a way to get right then they got away they fall off on the ground and they were hanging else but had they're edible you know what are you saying sometimes it takes a lesson to learn right takes a lesson to learn you wouldn't get him to take when them hurt someone's off that tree no right now you said what are you getting that brother Dale I'm getting it one time the tree of knowledge of good and evil do you realize what that would mean if it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil it would mean there was enough good in it to be good see if good but there's enough in it evil to kill you and see that was what happened in the garden when that be said you'll be as God's knowing good and evil yeah I never have been like a lot of I never believed that the garden of act was over a five minute period I don't there's no telling how long that situation took like her to come out the way it did but get the point the devil's inroad to Eve was one time you were made for this purpose as I said now do you want him got him here brother branham said it was an oncoming commission from God to multiply and replenish I said it would have taken place so what was the devil doing he wouldn't preach you know three-guard situation to Eve he was preaching to her how that she would be like God so what is the original sin unbelief unbelief but look how close the devil is Eve was made for the purpose of reproduction she was made and had the understanding while in Adam that there was to be a multiplication made multiply and replenish the earth and don't run Claver see that's where people do that you get into a message and I watch you it'll you know you say the Bible says multiply and replenish and the rest of the message you heard nothing about what I'm talking about multiplying all you hung on replenish they must have been a world before this world I heard that before there was probably people before this world and then that they got wiped out and when they got wiped out then God told Adam and Eve to replenish you have never heard preachers in this message talked about there must have been a pre-adamic people that existed before Adam and Eve maybe you don't listen what's being saying you need to listen real careful because your soul is involved you see how easy it was for Satan then to make his inroad into the human race was to explain to Eve the truth of the word of God of what she was made for to explain what she was made for pretty good preacher ain't no trinitarian you know what I mean by that don't you he ain't that far off he's later he's laying pretty good on the word but just remember the regional statement I made was what that original sin is still right here now he said whatever but brother Taylor I'm a firm believer in the word of God it is amen but just think if you eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil what would you come out with you would come out with a knowledge of good and evil acceptable I needed define that statement if you eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you're gonna come out with a knowledge of good and evil but if you eat of the Tree of Life you're gonna come out with a life of Almighty God right see they could eat of every tree but the tree of knowledge of good and evil so the tree was in the Garden of Life right why didn't he go to the Tree of Life Becca what is the Tree of Life the Word of God well I mean that sensor will bring it all the way down dogs and everything he comes down to the Word of God huh see Satan was not trying to get Eve to doubt that God said what he said and things but he was trying to get her to see that he was not going to kill her just because you were brought for that purpose Satan says you shall surely die but what'd she say I mean she said you will die for he that Satan said what you shall not die because you'll have a great revelation now isn't that what people of this message is trying to do it's on the message wisdom versus faith brethren said talking about even he says God made you for a purpose to be a mother what about it then what went wrong the way she became a mother right the way she became a mother she accepted Satan's lie perverting her spiritual part of her whether you want to call it shoulder spirit or whatever you called it back in the early parts of the message he got hurt the reason we know what realm that sets in the second realm of mankind he got hurt to reason about the word and remember the reasoning wasn't that far off look how close it was he said Eve you remember you were told to multiply and replenish I'm just trying to tell you how that's to be done what has been the goal and thoughts of mankind is it not true that all mankind even denominations and everything they speak of a God in a reality and Christ coming and living in us and you know to make us Christians and become a good people and have God's nature and ways about us isn't that the goal of all Christianity is anything wrong with that this coordinate how you go about it right so he said you were made to be a mother and brother Brennan said the spoke words of reading a seat she would have finally done it that she not accepted Satan's lie what was his lie now multiply and replenish you were made for this purpose ain't ladder yet right everything he was saying was right so he said okay I was made for this purpose I hope you listen to this with the right attitude so she goes home toaster Iseman and she begins to tell him about the things that were coming to her she just didn't reveal the source you know maybe but she began to talk to him and she says Adam was I made to be a mother he says yes honey that's the word woman did you've made to be a mother cause you a woman she said well he's anything else said I'm getting these doubts about that I can remember back when we were in theophany and we were told to multiply and replenish the earth and him says yes yes but he said it's not time yet it's not time yet that was the worst thing in the world a tailor woman because she's gonna beat you to death to try to get out of you what you talking about right she's gonna Burton you she's gonna worry you what do you mean we used to had a brother went to church here and all you had to do was just say something to him and turn around say oh that's all right forget it I'll explain it later he'd stay with you all day you know all night do you explain what you're talking about no so Eve she has nobody else to talk to no she talked to the animals that couldn't know next day she goes back to the Beast and says he said what took place he said I explained these times but said all that him said it wasn't time yet he said see that tolki they're trying to keep it from you you were made for it and God said if you do it now why don't you get on with it he got her to reason what's wrong with the church today is they've come to a place that I have a head knowledge of the understanding of the Prophet anything wrong with that no they come to the point of understanding and have the ability to explain a lot of things and they wrong with that no the only wrong in the garden was she took the wrong mate now come on tell me if I'm wrong there was nothing wrong with what he was saying to her he was quoting the word to her you were made for this purpose and God told you to do it wrong mate now quote brother Branham he said every time you get together and you mention knives and divorce if you only read I said every time imagine divorce is mentioned and it always goes back to the original see him this it's in the marriage and divorce he said any time that would come up the religious realm he said it goes back to the original sin in other words man can't order know what happened in the garden because see he had to first get the inroad into her mind which was the wound her inner being was through her brain and got her to think about it come on church he got you only go with the wrong thing didn't I get in trouble trying to explain it he wasn't trying to tell her how hot natured she was and all of those things like that I'm not talking that way and I've never preached that away that took place is it progressed in the act but the first thing was for her to listen to him reasoning to her about how she was made and what she was doing and all of these things and he was telling her the truth he was telling her you're a by-product so they'll tell you some other story the bees talking to you too because in the animal kingdom that God created male and female but said in the human realm did you was in Adam and listen you can't be deceived you are part of Adam it said that being you being a by-product that didn't make her no different than Adam that's what I'm trying my best to lay down a story to you to get you away from all of these flames and flying's that goes said you were made beautiful perfect you were made everything exactly correct because you were made out of Adam and said you're a by-product of Adam that's not a sinful state to be a by-product I hope you'll get that out of your mind eventually Co by-product exactly to be a product of a product whatever the regional product was you're a product of that he was a part of adam or unfit she's part of him in theophany he said she was part of him in the original creation so the devil's giving her another day or two through the Beast to talk to her about the word and he's telling her the truth that's the one thing I'm trying to get you to see if you don't see nothing else we think the devil is just a big old liar you know he's so shrewd and so perfect he uses the word of God to try to preach to you he doesn't have all kind of books and things to throw away he uses the Word of God the church that's why we better listen to what's being said we're in the last days we all talked about life days and the ending up of all things we better start listening get serious about our listening and be concerned because remember the devil he's not going to come to you and try to tell you a lie that just goes the way off he's gonna tell you 99.99% truth what was wrong in the garden wrong mate wrong mate I didn't write the book I got him here if you want me to read them to you butter brown who said she would have brought forth that child but said she couldn't wait he said she's just like sport original she said she's just like the church today says they can't wait i watch these young men and you know I've told you over and over and over I watch these young men come into the message to know their own fire their fireball and their preaching everybody just glory gifts right in there with them and everything you know and they're just really going I said just leave him alone I said just 40 years ago I said just leave him alone I said coach that go wonder how they're gonna wind down and that's what they've done the great fireballs of yesteryears they've window with the little bride she's supposed to just stay right with that word the devil comes and talks to her just say well in other words he comes and tries to tell you some defect that Eve was created with just say but God can't create anything wrong then you watch them turn around and leave you just remember that the Beast is who's talking to you huh well we don't like that you calling them preachers beasts I'm calling all those preachers beasts that won't stay with the Word of God I put myself you everybody else into that one category if we don't stay with God's Word we are no different and the beast was in the garden we're just trying our way some way to get to the feminine get to the feminist part of the Bride of Christ to get her deceived in believing what we're talking about and what's plainer do you want you better know I said this forty some years ago if you don't know where you stand Satan's gonna get you and he said 40 years to do a pretty good job of a lot of the people of this message what about it what about the fall that's always gonna be explained to all of these cretins the fall was for Eve to disbelieve God's Word then I explained that it wasn't that she wasn't lady she was made for that purpose she was made to multiply and replenish she was made all of those things the devil wasn't lying to her he was telling her the truth that's what caught her no we can see it's a literal act I preached it 47 years ago and I still preach it now the first end road to any woman is through her brain you think it ain't right where woman's a thousand times more either be deceived and you don't know women you don't know I know we're not against women I've always defended it and been standing on it so I don't have to deny about and say anything other than one thing the bride of Jesus Christ if she don't stay with God's Word she will be deceived it was told in the Word of God that this would take place that would take place the ages would come the bride would go into the ground all of these things would transpire right it was told in the Word of God before it ever happened we was also told in the Word of God that they'd be a bride that would stand only on the word and wouldn't listen to Satan's lie no matter Satan's lies telling her 99% truth all it takes is one percent what about it what was what is the follow to you it's to disbelieve God's Word the original sin not to sex act that took place because of the original sin that are already protrude / I went through her to beat her being and brought her to a position I know I shouldn't maybe say things but all of you know one thing for sure you know how you're made and what you made of and you know what all of that is about but why can't we put it in the right room and talk about Jesus Christ in His Church as husband and wife then we'll lose all of our thoughts of any kind of wrong things I've always said to you there's always been a life we always do about it but you just let said the other day you come in from work and there are you come in something and you start bragging on your wife how pretty she is and how she looks so good and and everything like that happening and man everything that's wonderful she loves to hear those time yeah why because she's a woman they don't matter but old man oh not me bowling at everything but just remember one time whatever you call the fall and what took place it's still taking place today right he said yeah but we're not in the Daltrey like Eve was we're in the worst kind of called spiritual adultery to not believe what the prophet of god has told us his spiritual adultery I listen to him screaming in the holler and I thank God I'm sure I'm glad you didn't choose me for that but yet he's saying it with a heart of love and compassion that he's trying his best to get two people to realize who they are and what they're taking place because you see the reason I keep titling the message one God series has been 25 messages that's the title look on the Internet is one God series in it is a subtitle reason I'm doing that cuz I ain't finished yet were the Godhead because if you're part of the Godhead and God ain't complete without you then there's more to be done in this day but it's not Satan with his perverted little flings of telling you how great you are and make it sometimes he has to tell us to sit down shut up and listen right but he's doing it with a heart of love come on Rosa he's doing it with love from a place that is beyond all love of mankind think on these things well I just don't understand you brother Dale because you the way you preach and you do no it's you're not wanting to understand just sit down and listen and think just think about you think about you and your life and where you came from is what's been in your life and you'll see and realize what God has been doing for us well we got rid of let's team what is the fall unbelief what is the original sin unbelief unbelief comes before anything else of natural points you talk about but Arun said before a woman can receive a man says she's got to receive him in her in her being if that ain't enough to let us know all of life and what's going on I hope you caught one thing I ain't wanted hammers this is I'm trying to get you to see the devil wouldn't tell in so much of the lies people tell to hear he was telling 99.99 percent true he just didn't tell her who that act was to take place with if he'd have turned to her and said go back to Adam that he wasn't gonna do that but he left her to reason go ahead well we got 116 [Music] stole I would save you came from glory [Music] how about anybody have a need so you let them get caught up in the basis of realizing you know her thousand thing well we can't be deceived if we ever get to thought we can't be deceive remember that is the deception yeah but the Bible said we can't be to see right because if your true bride you're gonna wake up one day one day the bride is gonna wake up to who she really is what's going on that's when she's going out of here you see we got it all figured out we know the quote like I say another day you mentioned revival to people to mention bad no more revivals revival Dover I've got the word the profit yeah but you ain't got all the words of the program when he gets in the silve ugh and he says the bride ain't had no revival yet did it take in seven unknown thunders to wake her up [Music] we're not fighting quotes they're not a worldwide revival coming no there's not a one the next worldwide system like that is two witnesses to the Jews but why can't we have a revival in our hearts and lives when the word is preached to us why can't we rejoice and say lord thank you for the revival that I have in my heart [Music] I've told you over and over it's been a revival in my heart ever since I heard the Prophet first dolphin why because I heard a man at no what are you talking about [Music] and it put me to the place that I wanted to know what he taught [Music] not the kind of a head knowledge but a revelation come into my heart and change my being to be what he wants me to be what about it [Music] original unbelief is still here now [Music] what is it is it scripture I know the probably quoted did lord help down my unbelief [Music] I remember preaching the message one time brother Moe said well I never noticed that Scripture the Bible speaks of and said will the Lord find faith when the Son of Man comes that's the question said will the Lord find faith we know he will why cause he promised it he's gonna have a bride cuz he promised it there's going to be a rapture cause he promised it there is a revival in the hearts with the Bride of Christ he promised it now he's doing it one more before we go to 51 [Music] and [Music] you would have been with us an is wrong coming out of the garden walking out of the garden singing that [Music] we got me singing some lights until people would come around and then cutting it up close and said we want to be around did y'all know the group that sings we shorted out to get a voice but at least we had enough to shout what we're talking about sing it under the Lord Father we thank you for the night and we just ask you to go with us now as we go our way take care of everybody's way O Lord give everybody up safe journey let your love in your graves be with us we love you and we thank you have your way in Jesus you just made it [Music] you [Music]
