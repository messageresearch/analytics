[11:23] now we keep on reading from the first
[11:25] Peter and then eventually we're going to
[11:28] get into second Peter said eventually
[11:32] but I don't know okay so we go to verse
[11:35] 18 for as much as you know that you were
[11:37] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[11:40] silver and gold from your vain
[11:42] conversation or your manner of life and
[11:45] things you know received by tradition
[11:46] from your father's but with the precious
[11:49] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[11:52] blemish and without spot who've early
[11:55] was foreordained before the foundation
[11:56] of the world but was manifest in these
[11:59] last times for you who by him do believe
[12:03] in God that raised him from the dead and
[12:07] gave him glory
[12:08] that's your faith and hope might be in
[12:11] God seeing you have purified your souls
[12:13] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[12:16] unto unfeigned that means white-hot as
[12:19] far as you can go with it you know that
[12:22] desire in your heart should be that away
[12:23] and the love of the Brethren see that
[12:26] you love one another with a pure heart
[12:28] fervently what being born again not a
[12:31] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[12:35] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[12:36] for ever take let's go to Joel 1 and
[12:42] world will just universal will use verse
[12:44] forward in Grover's chapter 2 that was
[12:47] the palmer worm had left at the locusts
[12:50] eaten and that which the locust had left
[12:53] has the cankerworm eaten and that which
[12:56] the cankerworm has left half the
[13:00] caterpillar eaten all right now we go to
[13:02] 2 and then we you know we pick up our
[13:06] thought from that 2 and 23 be glad in
[13:11] your children of Zion and rejoice in the
[13:13] Lord your God for he has given you the
[13:15] former rain moderately and he will come
[13:18] cause to come down for you the rain the
[13:21] former and the latter rain in the first
[13:24] month now remember how in the world
[13:26] could that be it's got to be a spiritual
[13:29] but it's a natural looking at it how can
[13:31] you have former and latter how can you
[13:33] plant and then
[13:35] within one month so that means
[13:38] something's got to happen you got to
[13:41] change the natural story of planning and
[13:45] thing you can't keep the natural story
[13:48] to come for you got to go then into the
[13:50] spiritual because it's got to be a rain
[13:53] falling in quickening right at the same
[13:56] time all right so we'll get to that
[13:58] eventually and the floor shall be full
[14:03] of wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[14:05] wine and all and I will restore to you
[14:07] the years that the locust and the
[14:09] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[14:14] Plumber weren't my great army which I
[14:16] sent among you then you may be seated
[14:18] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[14:21] of the word remember what I always say
[14:23] when I read that Scripture because you'd
[14:26] say well look at our God sent these
[14:28] things among us no God permitted the
[14:32] things to come among us he did not send
[14:36] no locusts caterpillar etc etc he
[14:39] permitted it to take place so that it
[14:44] would be you know for our benefit all
[14:47] right now we've been talking about
[14:53] restoration then we went into some
[14:57] things talking of how the restoration
[15:01] deals only with that which has been here
[15:05] originally all right now that to me is a
[15:10] very valuable valuable thing to follow
[15:14] in a line through the Bible and to think
[15:17] of it alright there's things in the
[15:20] Bible that have not been here before
[15:23] they will be a time for it to come forth
[15:26] alright now it can be prophesied through
[15:30] the Bible but there has to be a time to
[15:34] come to that okay now as an example
[15:35] you've had the prophecies throughout the
[15:38] Bible of the millennial reign right but
[15:43] the millennial reign see is not a
[15:45] restoration because it's never been here
[15:48] before
[15:49] but it's been prophesied through the
[15:51] word and we'll come to pipes because
[15:55] it's do it that's the form of what I'm
[15:57] trying to lay down in your mind to keep
[15:59] you to thinking about is that the things
[16:03] that we talk about well this has got to
[16:05] be restored that's got to be restored
[16:07] there was a lot of things that had to be
[16:09] restored the new birth was never eaten
[16:11] away you can't bring forth the new birth
[16:15] and let it be taken away in any age or
[16:17] any time it cannot be you would leave
[16:21] that aged without the new birth you
[16:23] would leave them without eternal life so
[16:25] that can not be so the Holy Ghost was
[16:28] never eaten away the word was what was
[16:32] eaten away all right now the Holy Ghost
[16:36] can only work I want you to make sure
[16:38] and get this point the Holy Ghost can
[16:41] only work through the amount of word
[16:45] that you receive right now as I've
[16:50] Illustrated over and over to you so
[16:53] you've got a hundred and twenty in the
[16:54] upper room they receive these virtues
[16:56] that's what your prophet said all right
[16:58] but then you got 3,000 outside when our
[17:02] so later and they only receive the new
[17:05] birth as faith all right see now then
[17:10] that shows that that new birth could
[17:12] never be eaten away said upon this rock
[17:15] I'll build my church and the gates of
[17:18] Hell cannot prevail against him what a
[17:20] revelation of Jesus Christ so we say
[17:24] each time had the new birth I just got a
[17:27] thing from way did from a brother in
[17:30] some certain place but he said people
[17:33] was teaching you know that that nobody
[17:35] got the new birth in this life stage
[17:36] until 63 you know and all of that it's a
[17:42] whole bunch of stuff but you'd be
[17:43] surprised what's going on right now so
[17:45] if as you I just try to listen to the
[17:48] truth and try to receive the truth for
[17:53] the hour that we're living what about
[17:57] okay I won't get into that because let
[18:01] them go
[18:02] now listen talking about then that there
[18:08] has to be a restoration of the things
[18:12] that was eaten away and what was what
[18:15] was eaten away it couldn't be the holy
[18:18] ghost you can't do that but the word
[18:22] brother Brown said to pure unadulterated
[18:24] word went into the ground but on the
[18:27] back the third and the fourth age right
[18:29] in there it went into the ground because
[18:31] it was eating away all right now see
[18:35] then that word being eaten away it was
[18:38] promised to be restored okay see that
[18:42] way then the hour is here that we
[18:46] believe that we're in the end of time if
[18:48] not wish you're in bad shape anyway you
[18:50] know if you don't believe it because
[18:52] most of us are hitting our our prime
[18:55] time of life you know and we're gonna
[19:01] get out of here
[19:02] one way or the other so I want it to be
[19:06] the right way don't you
[19:08] I got a quote where brother Brennan said
[19:10] we don't need to look out there you
[19:12] remember that what's the point he always
[19:14] made he said where we mess up is looking
[19:17] back to what has been looking forward to
[19:21] what is coming failing to get what's
[19:24] taking place now what's coming is no
[19:27] good to you and I a change of the body a
[19:31] rapture etc that's no good to you and I
[19:34] you because it's not my plan offenses
[19:36] it's not here at that point all right
[19:40] so we don't look back we don't look
[19:41] forward looking at what's taking place
[19:43] now today is the day of salvation all
[19:47] right now see then keeping that as we're
[19:50] trying to bring in the last message of
[19:54] you can have Reformers and that's why in
[20:00] Luther we'll read in a minute you know
[20:02] Luther was called a reformer Wesley was
[20:06] called a reformer even brother Branham
[20:09] will bring it over into the gifts and
[20:12] restoration and still talking about
[20:14] reformed wine
[20:15] because a reformer comes to reform the
[20:18] former age he doesn't have enough word
[20:22] to get to church totally out so he gets
[20:25] it out as much as he can so Luther
[20:28] taught the just shall live by faith now
[20:30] the just shall live by faith was a
[20:32] restoration of God's Word all right but
[20:36] the age and the time and the happening
[20:40] of mankind was reformers time all right
[20:44] so then Luther knew they they tried to
[20:48] pick on that church back there trying to
[20:51] straighten it up Luke this whole goal
[20:53] I've read his own writing about his
[20:55] whole goal was not to leave the Catholic
[20:57] Church it was to try to straighten up
[21:00] the church and that's why brother Adam
[21:03] will call it a reformer and he's trying
[21:08] to reform that Catholic people away from
[21:10] their thing and it struck that the just
[21:14] shall live by faith now there was the
[21:16] word for the age but the people of that
[21:19] age could not go on any further then run
[21:21] around and we read it to you were that
[21:23] Luther's age was called an unfulfilled
[21:25] age all right it never reached a
[21:29] maturity before it could go on it went
[21:33] back down we'll get to that in a minute
[21:35] until we have some might be surprises if
[21:40] we can get to the end of the message
[21:42] this morning all right but see Wesley
[21:46] then he comes along he jumps onto that
[21:50] church beaten against their doing and
[21:51] trying to reform the church the message
[21:56] of sanctification is the restoration of
[21:58] the Word of God amen
[22:01] but it didn't bring forth enough to
[22:03] bring back the original like it was on
[22:07] the day of Pentecost then the
[22:09] restoration of the gifts came in Azusa
[22:11] Street came with the baptism with the
[22:13] Holy Ghost and I read it to you our
[22:15] Wednesday where brother Branham is in
[22:16] the resume of the ages where he said it
[22:19] what looked like was to come forth and
[22:22] be the great promised coming he said it
[22:26] didn't said it proved it they
[22:28] denominated a
[22:29] died and took it now the bride of that
[22:32] age didn't die it didn't the age itself
[22:41] is what's dying in the things but the
[22:44] bride of that age was the bride of that
[22:46] age she was the new birth
[22:49] all right so Azusa Street came forth
[22:52] with the gifts not just speaking in
[22:54] tongues not just that we say penticoff
[22:58] speaking in tongues that's all we talk
[23:00] about they had the restoration of the
[23:03] name right what was his name Seymour and
[23:10] some of those came forth with the name
[23:13] Jesus being restored right all right she
[23:18] didn't come forward with a lot of things
[23:20] to that a but it still didn't come back
[23:22] and bring it to the way it was supposed
[23:24] to bring it why because it was reformer
[23:28] it wasn't time receive in this life day
[23:32] messenger was not to be a reformer
[23:35] because he's a prophet all right see all
[23:40] right being a prophet he's in that word
[23:43] and he's not a reformer he's bringing
[23:47] the word that will start the restoration
[23:50] Luther started it with a judgment little
[23:52] by faith Wesley brought more of
[23:54] sanctification that was part of the word
[23:57] being restored but it didn't finish
[23:59] I keep want you to see that because that
[24:03] way then you can see where you're
[24:04] standing see that's what a lot of people
[24:09] say you know or when I get the new work
[24:11] I get everything well no that's contrary
[24:15] to the Bible contrary to the prophet but
[24:16] people don't care they're just the same
[24:18] own that is evidence of the Holy Ghost
[24:20] you ain't gonna change that person that
[24:22] believes that's their evidence it's
[24:25] gonna take God to have to move on the
[24:27] scene in that person's life
[24:28] to convert them from that because if not
[24:31] they're still gonna go right on
[24:32] but I've spoke in tongues you say what
[24:35] you want to but I spoke in - told you
[24:39] about a lady telling me
[24:41] she was dire when her children received
[24:44] the baptism of the holy ghost speaking
[24:46] in tongues and she named one of them and
[24:50] the girl was in some horrible situations
[24:54] I said no sister I'm just gonna be
[24:55] playing we don't you tell me she got the
[24:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost because she
[25:03] wouldn't be acting like she is right now
[25:05] I said she met spoke in tongues but that
[25:11] don't have it but still that didn't
[25:12] matter see she did more nothing more to
[25:15] do with me because I didn't agree with
[25:18] her saying that's the way people are
[25:20] we'll get to that as we go along all
[25:24] right but in this age according to the
[25:27] first seal now I gave these to you
[25:31] started it off so they don't have to
[25:33] pull this up but you just remember it's
[25:36] in the first seal where the Prophet says
[25:38] the Reformers came to return the Fallen
[25:41] Church age all right and those reformers
[25:46] come and the church age when it was and
[25:49] it went back into the world the words
[25:52] Luther him come out started to do it but
[25:55] to prove it it was not the great move of
[25:58] us of the book of Acts it went right
[26:02] back into the think you're gonna see it
[26:05] a little bit you know bread around them
[26:07] covers a lot of things a lot of ways you
[26:14] when you we get down to the end of it
[26:16] maybe you'll think about it the message
[26:20] called cankerworm palm warm locals
[26:22] caterpillar you need to listen to that
[26:24] message because right around them in the
[26:27] restoration the bride tree covers it but
[26:29] on this message he's more specific you
[26:31] know what he says you ever heard him say
[26:34] it this way he said what the Methodist
[26:37] left the Baptists ate what the Baptist's
[26:44] left the Pentecostals ate and he said it
[26:49] come down to a stump just identically
[26:52] the way he describes it in the ages
[26:55] of the restoration of the broad tree so
[26:58] remember that same bug as I saying the
[27:01] other day when you when Wade was
[27:03] bringing that out and that that quite
[27:04] righteous Church right I said oh bug is
[27:07] after Eid but remembering all of that
[27:09] was a group of people that was trying
[27:12] honest hearted people trying to serve
[27:15] God I think about that just like it was
[27:18] in world war two there when the when the
[27:21] Jews was being persecuted so much you
[27:23] know there was a lot of those German
[27:25] people I mean you know the the people
[27:27] back there lost their lives because they
[27:29] protected those Jews they stood up for
[27:32] him see because it was good people all
[27:35] right so think about now what does it
[27:38] say when you come to getting to the age
[27:42] he said I want you to see what I mean
[27:46] listen the first thing you know here
[27:51] comes the church age is such a mess
[27:53] along comes John Wesley another reformer
[27:56] see the buildings and the see buildings
[27:59] another church age their bills get what
[28:04] I mean
[28:04] another church age is built as long as
[28:09] you have a church age coming into being
[28:11] you're dealing with Reformation I don't
[28:16] care how much you think you're doing
[28:17] you're doing with Reformation that's why
[28:19] there is not an eighth day there's not
[28:24] an eighth Church age there's an eighth
[28:27] day going into eternity physically yes
[28:30] okay well and over but not an eight
[28:32] Church age you can't do that you got to
[28:36] end it with a seven because in the
[28:38] seventh church age according to what
[28:40] he's saying here from the first seal and
[28:42] I'm reading from 189 up to 194 but in
[28:46] the last days it'll have to be a prophet
[28:48] to take up the mysteries of God bring it
[28:52] back because the mystery was only known
[28:54] by the prophets so it has to be this
[28:57] fella come see what I mean now he can't
[29:00] be a reformer he's got to be a prophet
[29:03] because it's got to be somebody that's
[29:06] gifted and set bare that catches the
[29:08] word
[29:09] now do you see what I've tried to
[29:10] explain alright
[29:16] Paul comes forth
[29:21] you remember that Peter teaches the
[29:24] Statue a perfect man and how to become
[29:26] to that place Paul comes in doesn't even
[29:29] confer with him other than just a little
[29:31] bit in his and then he leaves and he's
[29:34] gone for one time he mentions 14 one
[29:37] time two three and a half but or three
[29:39] the earth or something all right and he
[29:42] comes back teaching the same thing that
[29:45] Peter was teaching but he was teaching
[29:47] adoption and that's exactly what Peter
[29:51] was teaching was adoption alright
[29:54] because he Paul was a prophet that God
[29:58] could take to the backside of the desert
[30:00] and not out to get it and he said I
[30:02] didn't get this from no man well you
[30:04] know what brother branham didn't get
[30:05] that message from no man you remember
[30:09] some of them said about the serpent
[30:11] seeds and he must have got it from
[30:12] someone who grew up in the mountains
[30:14] back there or something he said no no he
[30:17] didn't get it from there see brother
[30:19] branham with this church age messenger
[30:21] remember he's got to do two things he's
[30:25] a special built person for doing it
[30:27] alright but as he does then he's comes
[30:31] forth and see he could go to the to the
[30:35] backside of the desert as we call it God
[30:37] could carry him up the statue of a
[30:39] perfect man and he gets up there
[30:41] intelligent in the statue of a perfect
[30:43] man what God has done with him the least
[30:45] little nod and all the things you know
[30:47] why because he was a prophet but he was
[30:52] having to do first the work of the
[30:55] seventh church aids messenger to restore
[30:58] the faith of the fathers to preach there
[31:03] and see being a prophet he could get
[31:06] that you understand what well I try to
[31:09] make it you said well you know we've
[31:11] heard enough about brother Brian being a
[31:13] prophet
[31:13] now you hadn't heard enough about him
[31:15] being a prophet not when you ask people
[31:18] will say well how do we get this well I
[31:20] don't know
[31:23] well brother branham tells us how he
[31:28] brought the word starting back during
[31:31] his early ministry to restore it back to
[31:34] the faith of the fathers proving it by
[31:36] what he was preaching as he went along
[31:38] as I stand there the other day he gets
[31:41] into spoken word his original seed
[31:44] Durango and ask you where anybody read
[31:47] that or listen to the time the brother
[31:51] branham said on there I've got him out
[31:55] on the limb Lord he went right through
[31:57] the message how did that messenger was
[31:59] to come and how I ever thing was to
[32:01] happen and the faith of the fathers was
[32:03] to be restored and brought back to the
[32:07] church and then he turns and he says
[32:10] Lord I got him out on a limb now one
[32:13] we're gonna do God says pick up your pen
[32:17] and write he picked up his pen and read
[32:19] read that that he wrote he starts
[32:23] writing it and when he comes down to the
[32:26] bottom of it he's standing at the same
[32:29] place that he just preached without any
[32:33] hope because the best he could do would
[32:37] have been faith of the father I've told
[32:42] you over and over you don't like it I'm
[32:44] sure but if ever a person in the world
[32:46] had the faith of the fathers it'd be a
[32:49] wonderful world but they'd still be no
[32:51] change of these bodies because there was
[32:54] no change back there all right we got to
[32:58] get the restoration back to the faith of
[33:00] the fathers before you could even talk
[33:02] about a change of the body other than
[33:04] that we're going to go by the grave
[33:08] right we're going to go by the grave
[33:11] because we don't know the thing to take
[33:14] us to a change the message he's already
[33:18] brought if you just listen we're not
[33:20] looking for something else to come the
[33:23] message has done bitten bro God has
[33:25] already done the work proved it but he
[33:29] stood there on the spoken word and
[33:30] reading those seed and he said my lord
[33:32] what do I do
[33:34] he told him he said you speak
[33:36] depending right when he got down to that
[33:39] life part there was something added to
[33:42] his thought what was it but as of yet
[33:45] Malachi 4 is not fulfilled now I didn't
[33:51] write the book ok see then being that of
[33:56] Malachi 4 he could see where what he had
[34:00] brought but he could see there was
[34:02] something wrong because it was not
[34:05] taking him to the change you know you
[34:10] don't I know you're not a minister
[34:13] you're not supposed to do all of the
[34:15] different things with me
[34:17] you ever heard brother around I'm
[34:18] talking about it's like candy taken from
[34:20] a baby have you ever experienced that
[34:26] have you ever really felt that a way
[34:28] about God I preached in 79 the seals in
[34:39] a series and when I finished I stopped
[34:44] because I had a gap between me and
[34:48] eternity
[34:51] the gap was in the word I couldn't go
[34:55] across I laid it aside 82 and 83 I went
[35:02] back come up to that same place and when
[35:05] I did it just went right straight on
[35:07] right on into the opening of the world I
[35:11] tell you that not to say something about
[35:14] me but to tell you it's dire God works
[35:17] it that away if you just listen in your
[35:19] life you'll see what's happening to you
[35:22] you'll see how God is speaking to you
[35:24] and turn you over humps and hurdles in
[35:27] your life if you just listen to it well
[35:33] I'm not if I'm not listen to the
[35:35] simplicity of God speaking to your heart
[35:42] okay let's see the Luther node I'm
[35:48] quoting brother Branham that the bread
[35:50] wasn't the body of Christ so he preached
[35:54] now this is off the first single
[35:56] paragraph 194 he knew that the bread
[35:59] wasn't the body of Christ and so he
[36:02] preached the judge shall live by faith
[36:05] he saw he preached it he knew there was
[36:14] something was wrong so he preached the
[36:19] just shall live by faith
[36:20] now he was talking about the body and
[36:25] what does the justice shall live by
[36:28] faith have to do with the thought that
[36:31] he was having that this body is I mean
[36:34] this bread is not the blood it's not the
[36:36] body and God speaks to him and he
[36:41] preaches the just shall live by faith
[36:45] 1 because it went into a revelation he
[36:49] preached justification look and when
[36:52] John Wesley come along he saw there was
[36:53] sanctification so he preached
[36:55] sanctification which one was it when a
[37:00] minute of the older brothers back there
[37:02] he talked about faith or something he
[37:05] said preach faith and do you get faith
[37:10] preached faith until you get faith so
[37:18] John Wesley come to America to convert
[37:21] the heathen right he met the Moravians
[37:27] River how you pronounce it on his way
[37:29] over here and they actually had the
[37:31] message already going of sanctification
[37:34] they may not have known how to call it a
[37:37] lot of things but as they did they
[37:40] introduced John Wesley to it
[37:42] John Wesley goes back home he says I
[37:44] will head to America to convert to he
[37:46] had come found out I was a healer into
[37:50] it didn't mean that he wasn't saved
[37:53] under the message of Luke
[37:54] come on he didn't find out he was lost
[37:58] he found out there was a gap that needed
[38:02] to be filled in his life or something
[38:04] choisi does he he starts searching to
[38:07] God
[38:08] and he found that sanctification and he
[38:11] preached sanctification I tell you what
[38:15] he must have been a pretty good man
[38:17] I've got his book at the house and some
[38:20] kind of rotten about if you'd like to
[38:21] read it where his wife would hire a
[38:24] chariot to follow him around the country
[38:27] to see where he was really preaching or
[38:31] what he was doing
[38:32] and she would drag him around the floor
[38:36] by the hair of his head and he wouldn't
[38:41] say a thing I think he sanctified don't
[38:45] you I believe now my ride that John
[38:49] Wesley came in and his house was on fire
[38:51] I believe that's correct I'm recording
[38:54] that is from memory from well and back
[38:55] see his house was burned down he said
[39:00] thank God that's one of the other things
[39:02] I don't have to fool with we'd all be
[39:06] crying snubbing in whoo blabbering and
[39:09] everything else wouldn't he just simply
[39:11] said that's one of the things I got
[39:12] fooled
[39:15] you see jurors will great men great
[39:20] warriors of faith come on in to Azusa
[39:24] Street with it and get with them
[39:26] bringing the gifts and the things back
[39:29] into the church and see what they were
[39:31] doing how they would lay in pray all
[39:34] night how they would beg God brother
[39:39] Branham said it I didn't I can find you
[39:41] a quote where he said he said talking
[39:44] about Azusa Street and right in that
[39:45] period of time now not exactly knowing
[39:47] what a part but he said something like
[39:50] that he said they were closer to the
[39:52] coming of the Lord than we are why
[39:57] because they didn't have no doctors to
[40:00] go to they didn't have no medicine to
[40:02] depend on and praise God for all of it
[40:05] but they didn't have none of that they
[40:08] had to depend on God and cry out to him
[40:11] no great people but still as this the
[40:18] street wasn't the end of it why because
[40:20] they begin to denominated and die though
[40:23] the runner said Don the seal book he
[40:24] said they cabbage down on it they begin
[40:29] to die and go into the ground then
[40:32] somewhere about in the 30s there you see
[40:34] the Prophet striking the earth and he
[40:38] starts out preaching a life he starts
[40:42] out preaching a justification of Luther
[40:44] a sanctification of Wesley and the
[40:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost of course he
[40:52] didn't know to call it Pentecostal he
[40:55] wasn't involved in that for a long time
[40:57] right it was only in his life so many
[41:00] years later he found the Pentecostal
[41:02] people and he began to go on and with
[41:04] them but they were great wonderful to
[41:07] him who some of us were talking about
[41:08] this the other day they were really
[41:10] great to him they really wanted him oh
[41:13] yeah all out through the Arizona's they
[41:16] wanted him to come and preach to him but
[41:20] when he stepped down at the tabernacle
[41:24] and he moved out west he said it I
[41:30] didn't he said I come among you and he
[41:36] said but now nobody will have me you
[41:38] know what that's freighter as Freight
[41:41] he's gonna start a church and he told
[41:45] them I am NOT going to start a church
[41:48] but the Peregrine started to church it
[41:50] brother branham's request now that's the
[41:52] words he said what you see they honored
[41:58] that to start with just like the Lord
[42:00] Jesus they wanted him among them until
[42:02] he began to say I and my father one well
[42:05] they got afraid of brother Branham and
[42:07] then when he started preaching those the
[42:10] seals and the deeper things and going on
[42:12] in it oh yeah they just turned away from
[42:14] them but haven't helped them
[42:18] that's their business this messenger is
[42:22] not to start a Reformation I'm quoting
[42:25] from brother Branham but he's to have
[42:28] all the mysteries that those reformers
[42:31] left off and gather them together and
[42:33] solve them to the people now where do we
[42:38] get to the end of the message work that
[42:42] was not his message letter Brandon was
[42:47] in a two-part form he was to be the
[42:51] church age messenger but he was Gope to
[42:55] go beyond that and bring the message all
[43:00] right
[43:01] his message didn't begin in the seals
[43:04] all that was restoration back to the
[43:06] faith of the fathers I've tried to say
[43:09] that for 50 years but who's listening do
[43:13] you see how important that is how in the
[43:16] world could you and I ever achieve into
[43:19] the statue of a perfect man or the faith
[43:20] of the fathers without hearing the
[43:22] prophets message I wasn't the one that
[43:24] made the statement 327 church age book
[43:26] What did he say this messenger of
[43:28] Malachi 4 word revelation 2:10 7 will do
[43:30] two things 1 turn the hearts for the
[43:32] children back to the faith of the father
[43:34] to reveal the seven thunders which is a
[43:37] revelation contained in the seven seals
[43:39] and it'll be these where they finally
[43:41] reveal mystery truths that literally
[43:43] turn our hearts back so if we want our
[43:45] hearts to be turned back to the faith of
[43:46] the father why have the people turned
[43:48] down the seals and the message of
[43:50] brother Branham his message didn't begin
[43:54] in 43 I remember when you want to come
[43:56] up with a date or a thirtysomething or
[43:58] do we got 40 something that starts to
[44:00] last 47 it didn't start back there that
[44:05] was restoration back to the faith of the
[44:07] father back to work the Bible had been
[44:10] preached but because it was written by
[44:12] mankind
[44:15] we've got to come back to that place
[44:18] before we can talk about anything else
[44:23] 50 years I've been screaming they're
[44:27] trying to get somebody to see we've got
[44:30] to have the faith of the fathers
[44:33] no we don't need to know this we don't
[44:36] need to know that we just need to be
[44:37] good and go to church yeah it's kind of
[44:45] like I told a brother one time he said
[44:49] well these tape people he said there
[44:50] they're sitting at home and listening to
[44:53] tapes what do you think I said I'll tell
[44:56] you what a thing I can you show me one
[44:58] tape Church that ever amounted to
[45:02] anything now we've got some that come
[45:06] out of those tough situation but if you
[45:09] don't realize that truth is something
[45:10] wrong your blindness I said show me I
[45:19] said because we've got a house something
[45:21] present tense and I've never been but
[45:24] one thing and I'm playing people of this
[45:28] message see the biggest portion of them
[45:29] looking for brother Branham to come back
[45:31] and to bring this and that in the other
[45:33] I've never said a thing about I preached
[45:36] it from the day one to where I'm
[45:38] standing today that I believe he will
[45:41] come back all right because I believe
[45:45] you'll be first in the resurrection all
[45:48] right but if we don't get down into what
[45:53] he's already taught what good is for him
[45:56] to come back that's all I've ever said
[46:01] what you're trying to interpret this
[46:04] into turpan what I'm just saying that
[46:10] there's a place brother moment used to
[46:13] preach a message called and I'll find a
[46:14] quote for you but there's a place to be
[46:16] waiting I believe it's in the rapture
[46:17] message brother run said there's a place
[46:19] of the bride will be waiting for the
[46:21] revelation of the rapture I'm pretty
[46:22] sure it's a rapture immensely I remember
[46:25] him preaching that message a place to be
[46:26] waiting I've always gone to phrase then
[46:30] what don't go down to the bus depot to
[46:34] get you a ticket for the aircraft don't
[46:38] do that it won't work you got to go down
[46:42] to the airport so then you get to the
[46:45] word
[46:45] that's all I've ever
[46:47] get to the word and let the word change
[46:53] us could has got to be into that it's
[47:03] got to be to that word being restored
[47:07] why did the Prophet have to come why
[47:11] would it not be okay for him to be a
[47:12] reformer what would it not be okay for
[47:17] him to be a Lutheran Wesley or Baptist
[47:20] or Methodist or Presbyterians or
[47:22] Catholics or anything or all of these
[47:25] new messages and all these great things
[47:28] that's typically why would that not be
[47:29] it you don't take that away with the
[47:36] restoration of the word comes what come
[47:39] on I thought there was a quote that
[47:41] verse Ermine's
[47:43] power or strength I thought you're
[47:46] supposed to listen to that you're a
[47:48] perfect man with the restoration in the
[47:51] word the Prophet said comes the
[47:52] restoration of power that's the only way
[47:57] it can come you show me any other way
[47:58] I'm open
[48:00] show it to me any other thing than the
[48:02] opening of the word no it's okay to be
[48:09] this way it's what I say I got a piece
[48:10] of paper right in there I'll let you
[48:13] read it of what they call the new birth
[48:16] over in some of those countries
[48:25] you saw it's not confused brother Dale
[48:31] okay let's keep on going you've got to
[48:35] have the faith of the fathers that is
[48:37] the restoration back to the word can I
[48:41] quote this one the third seal and in the
[48:45] hour the time of the life's angel the
[48:48] seventh angel seventh messenger begins
[48:51] to sound the mystery of God is finished
[48:53] see restoration back to the word the
[48:57] Bible said again back to the faith of
[49:00] the fathers there it is read it back to
[49:05] the faith of the fathers do you think
[49:07] they'll receive it no sir
[49:09] last days he would restore the original
[49:12] word again as he said in Melancon for
[49:14] but said she's forfeited it she who the
[49:21] church system she's forfeited it
[49:25] oh they got building programs they got
[49:28] all kind of fun but where do they want
[49:30] this message come on
[49:37] he said like Eve in the Eden she
[49:41] rejected hers at Calvary and I see it
[49:46] and I see his group is rejecting here in
[49:49] their last day now he just brought you
[49:54] from back there others of the Old
[49:57] Testament Saints New Testament Bronto
[49:59] and now he's up to the day we're living
[50:02] showing that people are rejecting it we
[50:07] don't we don't need definitely death
[50:09] I remember Richard when you come told me
[50:11] one day he said I didn't know that the
[50:13] Prophet said we had to have their
[50:15] virtues someone that's what he's saying
[50:19] he said we had to have them why wouldn't
[50:24] we not want them well Georgia
[50:32] I cried and long to God from the time
[50:37] brother mo preached the stature of a
[50:39] perfect man I could see it was a
[50:40] necessity I cried to God for years Lord
[50:47] how can we get that Heath ain't beat
[50:51] somebody over the head and you get
[50:52] patience how can we get that then the
[51:00] quote that I just quoted this message
[51:04] melikhaya for do two things all right so
[51:07] there's two parts to his message are you
[51:10] agreeing or you listening part one is to
[51:13] return the faith of the father's that
[51:17] had to be done before the seals could be
[51:19] broke the hell now not to everybody else
[51:23] now I ain't saying it was dire I ain't
[51:25] that way I ain't no boy bless God in 63
[51:28] when the Prophet was dark he said the
[51:30] Lord was dying I say the Lord's here I
[51:33] said then I said quit playing garbage
[51:36] can just cause a prophet says it here
[51:41] brother dick could get up and he'd say
[51:43] have you ever seen know what is it when
[51:45] a the Eiffel Tower or something maybe he
[51:49] never saw that one but anything Statue
[51:51] of Liberty indeed say it's right here
[51:53] it's right over that blessed God there's
[51:56] the Statue of Liberty I've seen it how'd
[51:59] you see it well he told me about it
[52:02] well is that all you think the Prophet
[52:04] could do you can tell you but God's got
[52:12] a reveal we ain't going out I'm but we
[52:15] don't get to former in latter Ryan
[52:20] but listen Church what was to be
[52:24] restored read what I gave you the ones
[52:28] who read it all through the first seal
[52:30] and then picks up into the third seal
[52:33] and talks about the restoration of the
[52:35] word restoration back to what then he
[52:40] said it on the statue of a perfect man
[52:42] you remember we gave these for 18 for 19
[52:45] those
[52:46] disciples those people back there they
[52:48] know that was a nod from God they had
[52:51] these virtues in here
[52:52] they had these qualifications and the
[52:54] first little nod of God compared with
[52:57] every bit of this and with his word
[52:59] why did not those disciples take up
[53:02] every little doctor in an idea that come
[53:04] along because they knew it didn't comply
[53:07] with the word right so they rejected it
[53:12] why did God reject all of those books
[53:14] when the Bible begin the King James
[53:16] began to be put together because he
[53:18] didn't compile with the rest of the
[53:19] world and God annihilated it who
[53:22] rejected it from him wouldn't let him
[53:24] put those things in there because we had
[53:30] to have a word right
[53:34] well may I quote it word brother Branham
[53:36] did we had to have the word back in pure
[53:39] unadulterated
[53:40] if you'll go to stat to a spoken word
[53:42] and read no see he said to appear on the
[53:44] don't already in word it struck the
[53:46] world that's what he said go to read the
[53:50] book listen to the tape spoken words
[53:52] original see the pure unadulterated word
[53:54] has struck the world or through his
[53:58] ministry right they wouldn't in
[54:04] everybody and to his ministry he gets
[54:07] over to the Seventh Seal
[54:08] he said heard right in our six percent
[54:10] he said it's gone from you there's no
[54:12] way for you to know it he said what
[54:17] right around to come into the Lord read
[54:20] your message let's see well no I was I
[54:23] was dive lifeguard I heard he preached
[54:25] to see you I know what he talking about
[54:27] I didn't write the book but listen he
[54:37] said these those disciples those people
[54:40] they had these virtues they knew were
[54:44] this they know where they stood they
[54:48] know who they believed they kept on
[54:53] walking in the spirit doing only
[54:58] in the word just one nod from God just
[55:05] one not from God I come dem guys coming
[55:10] along they wanted to buy gifts and they
[55:12] want to do this that minute right
[55:15] and Linda book of Acts and God wanted to
[55:18] buy gifts you know one to do this area

[57:14] was the predestinated seed the royal
[57:18] seed of Abraham it could not die the
[57:21] word was in the roots of the promise the
[57:25] title of the message today is

[58:25] okay listen folks there was four death
[58:28] messengers killed that tree now listen
[58:31] to it or did it kill it out in the Dark
[58:37] Ages and started from the book of Acts
[58:40] that book was already dire in the book
[58:44] of Acts Paul talked of grievious wolves
[58:48] coming among you Paul said if any man
[58:52] preach anything then what I preach what
[58:54] a Galatians 1/8 he said let him be
[58:56] accursed now that's pretty strong in it
[59:00] he didn't play around he said let him be
[59:03] accursed if he said anything contrary to
[59:06] what I say and he double stated it said
[59:10] let me say it again that he'd be
[59:12] accursed
[59:15] those men were great men and stood on
[59:17] what they believed and they wrote the
[59:20] Word of God but as time went on what
[59:23] happened
[59:25] plumb worm locust can't go worm pummel
[59:28] worm is that right aiming for messengers
[59:31] of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree
[59:33] one took his fruit one took his bark
[59:36] when took his leaves one took his mark
[59:38] one took the life is that right amen
[59:40] four messengers of dogmas killed of the
[59:43] tree all but two roots I emphasize that
[59:48] all but the roots and four messengers of
[59:52] death killed a tree for messengers of
[59:54] life restores the tree do you get it he
[59:58] said amen amen for God said I will
[1:00:02] restore he's going to restore it how by
[1:00:07] for death messengers killed it then for
[1:00:10] live messengers will restore it what was
[1:00:12] the first Martin Luther justification
[1:00:16] what was the second John Wesley by
[1:00:19] sanctification what was the third
[1:00:22] Pentecostal pin third Pentecost with the
[1:00:25] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[1:00:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost come on what
[1:00:32] was the fourth the word what the word
[1:00:36] there were four great prophets what
[1:00:39] wasn't
[1:00:40] now come on are you are you lost in what
[1:00:43] we're trying to bring the ages was
[1:00:45] Reformation but the men were bringing
[1:00:48] the message of the age would be
[1:00:49] restoring the word back right but the
[1:00:55] age itself was Reformation and proving
[1:00:57] that it had to be Reformation they went
[1:00:59] right back and started another church
[1:01:00] age but this messenger and this life day
[1:01:05] didn't start no church age they tried to
[1:01:07] get him to but he said no way
[1:01:11] oh they done and they were done one of
[1:01:14] those latter rain brethren and all of
[1:01:16] that we look at it one of them Martin
[1:01:19] Luther he began to sound like there was
[1:01:20] a little light just a very small
[1:01:21] strength and justification Along Came
[1:01:24] Wesley stronger sanctification after
[1:01:26] West becomes stronger than him Pentecost
[1:01:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[1:01:33] great prophet now that's not brother
[1:01:37] Branham
[1:01:40] that's the Holy Ghost that came one day
[1:01:42] of Pentecost because the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] itself is the Prophet you say how do you
[1:01:46] know a lot read the rest they don't come
[1:01:50] to stronger in him Pentecost the baptism
[1:01:52] with the Holy Ghost in another great
[1:01:53] prophet but in the last days of Malachi
[1:01:56] 4 Elijah is to come with a very word the
[1:01:59] word of the Lord come to the Prophet in
[1:02:01] the evening lights it is to come forth
[1:02:03] to restore and bring back what turn the
[1:02:05] hearts of the children back to the faith

[1:02:31] point four is the number of Antichrist

[1:02:35] now what you talking about yeah I knew
[1:02:39] what he's talking about
[1:02:40] I want him say it and he said now
[1:02:45] brother Branham was that prophet to come
[1:02:47] to lady ousia
[1:02:51] number three see I said in other words
[1:02:55] what you believe is your number four he
[1:03:00] didn't back up and I didn't back up
[1:03:04] either

[1:03:10] life for is restoration yeah but I got I
[1:03:17] see you go get you books because I'm
[1:03:18] heading after mine ain't hateful but I'm

[1:03:26] went got the book and read where brother
[1:03:28] Brendan said life comes in the third
[1:03:30] stage fourth is this restoration which
[1:03:33] is the word being restored

[1:03:58] bugs laid it down for life we'll return
[1:04:03] it in coming up to a number three and
[1:04:06] stopping listen to it for killers took
[1:04:09] it for messengers destroyed for message

[1:04:24] the Book of Ezekiel ain't got time to
[1:04:26] fool with reading it but watch Leslie
[1:04:28] watch the fourth stage of Ezekiel's dry
[1:04:29] bones coming forth what's the fourth
[1:04:32] stage you got this got that you got seen
[1:04:34] using all without seeing you you can
[1:04:36] stand right there they could stand right
[1:04:37] there in Ezekiel and a full body
[1:04:40] standing there covered with skin but no
[1:04:43] life the Prophet had to breathe on them
[1:04:49] dry bones oh what a wonderful thing the
[1:04:53] prophet of this last day has breathed go
[1:04:57] back to blasphemous names and listen go
[1:04:59] back to where Jesus breathed on them in
[1:05:02] the Bible there and said receive ye the
[1:05:04] Holy Ghost they didn't get it right then
[1:05:06] but you know what they did they got it
[1:05:08] help around come on church look Ezekiel
[1:05:11] dry bones coming for but to life only
[1:05:13] come not when the sinew skin was on them
[1:05:16] but when the wind blowed upon them
[1:05:18] that's when that's when come back that
[1:05:22] forth the message all right now what's
[1:05:24] his brain then explain it justification
[1:05:26] brought back to pull sanctification
[1:05:29] brought back the bark doctrine of
[1:05:32] holiness
[1:05:32] what brought back the leaf Pentecostals
[1:05:35] what did it clap your hands and know you
[1:05:37] know rejoicing pinnacle what the fourth
[1:05:41] was the word itself the Word made flesh
[1:05:44] fruits of the proof of the resurrection
[1:05:46] signed that Christ has finally after
[1:05:49] justification been planted
[1:05:50] sanctification had been planted baptism
[1:05:53] of the Holy Ghost organization died out
[1:05:54] and Christ says again thus entered
[1:05:56] himself like that cup of the pyramid
[1:05:58] first line justification sanctification
[1:06:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:02] then coming of the couch
[1:06:05] the number force restoration of the word
[1:06:08] what is it the holy ghost months being
[1:06:09] honed out so that it can fit Oh the Holy
[1:06:12] Ghost Bunch we read that the Holy Ghost
[1:06:16] in brother Branham praise God but he
[1:06:19] said than in a bunch being honed out so
[1:06:22] it can fit with the same kind of
[1:06:24] ministry he had when he went away that
[1:06:27] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[1:06:29] thing in the rapture where the justified
[1:06:31] sanctified in the baptism when the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost that pyramid will stand again the
[1:06:35] house of God will live again the Tree of
[1:06:38] Life is growing it in are you with me
[1:06:44] can you follow it because we say for is
[1:06:49] an antichrist when you see children for
[1:06:55] come out to be an antichrist
[1:06:56] but remember there was four riders to
[1:07:00] oppose not just three riders to oppose
[1:07:04] the four stages there were four riders
[1:07:07] in the seals to oppose right and that
[1:07:11] life's riders are prophet right you see
[1:07:14] why that we've got to depend on what he
[1:07:16] brought he was the messenger to bring us
[1:07:19] the word well we've got to get it in the
[1:07:22] right order and not say well it's here
[1:07:24] because of this or here but are we
[1:07:26] waiting on this over here amen
[1:07:29] there's a lot of I'm waiting on in the
[1:07:31] Bible to be fulfilled amen but let me
[1:07:35] proclaim what's been fulfilled let me
[1:07:41] stand it proclaim what's been fulfilled
[1:07:45] then you can look for something cuz only
[1:07:47] when it's fulfilled in your life are you
[1:07:49] capable of looking to what's coming
[1:07:52] outside of that you're quoting something
[1:07:55] you're saying what somebody else saying
[1:07:58] you're not saying what the Bible says
[1:08:02] are you with me
[1:08:07] Holy Ghost must be include okay I quoted
[1:08:11] it to eat 327 Church age book what this
[1:08:15] mention you're Monica for gonna go to
[1:08:16] Thun one turn arts or the children back
[1:08:18] to the faith
[1:08:19] the father let me give you just a quick
[1:08:23] one they don't have to pull this butt
[1:08:25] off the Macy's Abraham's covenant
[1:08:26] confirmed he's talking about allies come
[1:08:30] and he would turn the hearts of the
[1:08:32] children to the father's our fathers to
[1:08:37] the children see cuz John turned their
[1:08:40] hearts of the father's to the children
[1:08:41] now listen to what he says those are I
[1:08:43] think it is where I won't miss reading
[1:08:45] it that's part of them aids you know you
[1:08:49] got hearing aids Rolaids and panda aids
[1:08:52] and that's part of living ok turn our
[1:08:58] hearts for the our hearts of the
[1:09:01] father's to the children see the old
[1:09:03] patriarch fathers and listen to it this
[1:09:07] is John the Baptist the old old Orthodox
[1:09:10] the legalist the law and Riemann he
[1:09:17] turned it back to the faith of the
[1:09:19] fathers here to the children the hearts
[1:09:22] to the children this new message that
[1:09:25] John was preaching of the coming Messiah
[1:09:29] in a hand he turned the hearts to this
[1:09:32] no watch but watch the next the next
[1:09:35] time John appears until my John the
[1:09:38] Baptist then he turned the hearts of the
[1:09:40] children back to the faith of the
[1:09:41] Pentecostal fathers so we'd be back to
[1:09:44] the original message and we you'll
[1:09:48] you'll know when it gets here it'll be a
[1:09:51] restoration to send that lukewarm the
[1:09:55] lady you'll see in church back to that
[1:09:56] original faith back yonder again see and
[1:10:00] he will be anointed to do so when this
[1:10:03] Elijah comes he'll be a prophet he'll
[1:10:05] pull no punches you'll cut nothing away
[1:10:08] even the end time of angel' ISM the end
[1:10:11] time message is to get the bride ready
[1:10:13] and prepared for the rapture what can it
[1:10:16] do according to my left eye for it bring
[1:10:19] is bring them back to the faith that was
[1:10:23] once delivered to the Saints bring them
[1:10:25] back to the faith of the father's the
[1:10:27] Pentecostal part in the restoration time
[1:10:30] I will restore all right
[1:10:33] back to the faith of the fathers listen
[1:10:42] to what he said here on be not afraid
[1:10:44] 1963 it points exactly to the broad tree
[1:10:49] this hour the same spirit to return back
[1:10:52] again and the fruit no got it and the
[1:10:57] fruit of the Spirit to be manifested to
[1:11:00] restore the faith of the children back
[1:11:01] to the faith of the fathers again it's
[1:11:04] just exactly the same thing all the way
[1:11:07] I wish you would look that up a lot on
[1:11:08] what did I tell you that I believe it's
[1:11:10] 66 times brother Brown says faith for
[1:11:12] the father I mean that's very word faith
[1:11:17] of the Father 66 times all the way
[1:11:19] through his whole message he's preaching
[1:11:21] the same thing it's exactly the same
[1:11:23] thing all the way through the Bible
[1:11:24] predicted to be here and here we are
[1:11:26] immediately after the baptism falls and
[1:11:29] listen and things like that there is
[1:11:32] supposed to be a restoration of the last
[1:11:35] days did you read it immediately after
[1:11:41] the baptism folks what was that
[1:11:43] Azusa Street right there supposed to be
[1:11:51] a restoration at the last days and
[1:11:54] people don't put it off look way out
[1:11:58] here in the future it usually goes right
[1:12:02] over the top of your head and you miss
[1:12:05] it be ready if it's Scripture took ahold
[1:12:09] of it if it's not Scripture leave it
[1:12:11] alone see but so help me if scripture
[1:12:15] see that's what he did in the other days
[1:12:17] if he's the same today he'll do the same
[1:12:21] bringing us the message he bringing us
[1:12:28] to that place don't turn it down but
[1:12:31] listen brother Branham was to do two
[1:12:35] things right turn arsons children back
[1:12:38] to faith of father then
[1:12:43] restored that ARCA bring the seven
[1:12:45] thunders which is revelation containing
[1:12:47] the seven seals 327 or changeable it'll
[1:12:50] be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:12:51] truths that literally turn the sky so
[1:12:53] that's a two-part thing that's why you
[1:12:56] when you're studying blood around this
[1:12:58] message if you listen to him you'll see
[1:13:01] him preaching and he'll be here in a
[1:13:04] minute he's up here the minute he's back
[1:13:07] down here he's bringing things and
[1:13:10] trying to line it up he came to first
[1:13:15] restores back to the faith of the Father
[1:13:17] and the faith of the father's is the
[1:13:19] statue of a perfect man the faith of the
[1:13:21] father's is adoption the faith of the
[1:13:23] father's is the one God - water baptism
[1:13:25] the no eternal hell - all of the thing
[1:13:28] he was to bring all of that he brought
[1:13:30] it and stood there with it as I said on
[1:13:33] spoken words original seed and said Lord
[1:13:35] I've done all of this I ask you please
[1:13:38] please just go home and get that message
[1:13:43] if you don't think enough of your soul
[1:13:45] to go get that message and listen to it
[1:13:51] or read it then your soul is not the
[1:13:54] most important thing about you I know
[1:13:57] what he said well tell me what he said
[1:14:02] he brings you up to the faith of the
[1:14:04] fathers and then he says something's
[1:14:07] wrong yep mouth call for him full feel
[1:14:11] so what he set out to do the runs
[1:14:16] message did not begin in 47 that was a
[1:14:19] restoration back to us in the Bible you
[1:14:23] find him in 62 he starts to laying it
[1:14:25] down in the 62 he gets into the pride
[1:14:28] the things he preaches faith what is it
[1:14:32] the key I ask you to get right in that
[1:14:35] area they're just winding up or 62 and
[1:14:38] get those tapes and then go into 63 and
[1:14:41] see what happened especially serves what
[1:14:45] time is it he knows it's there but he
[1:14:50] knows he's got to go somewhere so he has
[1:14:52] to go west to get what when you go west
[1:14:55] to get
[1:14:57] did he go west to get to faith of the
[1:14:59] Father did he go west to get the Word of
[1:15:03] God that was already in the Bible he
[1:15:05] said when he whipped that top off one of
[1:15:07] the statement says as far as man knew
[1:15:09] and had preached these things he went
[1:15:19] west to get his message okay we're gonna
[1:15:23] end it by reading this well let them
[1:15:25] pull it up while they bring it up number
[1:15:30] 13
[1:15:30] I'll read part of number 12 bring back
[1:15:33] in the last days these great things that
[1:15:35] he promised it'll bring that it'll it'll
[1:15:37] bring the revelation what's he to do
[1:15:40] Malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of
[1:15:43] the fathers to the children
[1:15:44] that's right to bring that same thing
[1:15:47] the same pillar of fire and on the scene
[1:15:50] and same signs and same wonders the same
[1:15:53] Jesus making him the same preaching him
[1:15:56] the same vindicating him to be the same
[1:15:58] now didn't that didn't that what he
[1:16:00] preached did not he stand right there
[1:16:02] with the word improving the faith of the
[1:16:07] fathers was our guard backed it up is
[1:16:10] that true
[1:16:11] they look at him so when he gets to
[1:16:14] works his faith expressed he talks about
[1:16:19] him turn back in the great Elohim
[1:16:21] that'll bring to pice today because we
[1:16:25] have faith I know this is of God is
[1:16:28] because this and the other scriptures
[1:16:31] points to this hour
[1:16:33] revelation 10 said in the hour of the
[1:16:36] seven angels message when he begins to
[1:16:39] sound forth his message not in a healing
[1:16:42] service but the message that follows the
[1:16:48] healing service right now come on are
[1:16:53] you with me are you with him and the
[1:16:58] healing services were to bring back the
[1:17:00] faith of the fathers and restore and God
[1:17:03] proved it now look at the next one look
[1:17:06] at number 14 I haven't heard but now I
[1:17:08] see these are 65
[1:17:10] now that we're promised to church age to
[1:17:14] reformers and we've had them but he
[1:17:16] promised in Malachi 4 he to keep his
[1:17:19] pattern in the last days what would take
[1:17:21] place to turn the hearts of the children
[1:17:22] back to the faith of the Apostolic
[1:17:24] father for that very purpose and the
[1:17:28] church is so broke up in denominations
[1:17:31] and isms it's so torn to pieces till
[1:17:34] it's dead and watch him it's been a care
[1:17:39] of year we could preach the whole
[1:17:41] message right there
[1:17:42] only the denominations was carriers
[1:17:45] that's what your prophet said go to
[1:17:47] masterpiece seed not our with a shuck
[1:17:49] read them to messages you'll see what
[1:17:51] he's talking about what the carriers are
[1:17:54] indeed he promised in the hour of the
[1:17:57] seventh angels message the seven seals
[1:17:59] would be revealed in the mysteries of
[1:18:00] God would be declared revelation 10 when
[1:18:03] the seventh angel begin to sound his
[1:18:04] message not the healing service the
[1:18:07] message that follows the healing service
[1:18:10] where do the next one number fifteen
[1:18:15] trying to do God a service without being
[1:18:17] the will of God then you read all the
[1:18:20] message but brain don't know do we get
[1:18:21] to the water
[1:18:22] the mysteries were revealed and will be
[1:18:25] revealed in the life days when the
[1:18:27] seventh angels seventh angels message
[1:18:30] when he not when he starts out doing
[1:18:33] this but when he begins to sound his
[1:18:36] message see not the years in preparation
[1:18:39] well when he begins to sound the message
[1:18:42] these mysteries then will be revealed
[1:18:45] and here they are not knowing them and
[1:18:49] you people are a witness of that now
[1:18:52] remember brother Branham never preached
[1:18:56] marriage and divorce in 62 he didn't
[1:19:01] preach it in 47
[1:19:04] but around he tried to preach the seals
[1:19:07] because you got a message even title at
[1:19:09] the seal but in you and Ryan he went
[1:19:12] back preached 63 he said marriage and
[1:19:16] divorce was revealed in the seals
[1:19:17] he said even serpent seed was revealed
[1:19:22] in the season
[1:19:23] it was preached in 58 it was in the word
[1:19:28] you remember what they kept asking
[1:19:30] brother Branham about this marriage and
[1:19:32] divorce brother Branham could we do this
[1:19:35] can we do that he said listen he said if
[1:19:38] you believe mean I'm perforated but he
[1:19:40] said if you believe me he said go on as
[1:19:42] you are until I until you hear from me
[1:19:44] is that close enough go on until you
[1:19:47] hear from me
[1:19:48] he said they's been places things made
[1:19:50] rot in the Bible but he said go on until
[1:19:53] then now that's on question as an answer
[1:19:55] to 64 I'll be glad to bring him for you
[1:19:57] that's before he gets to the seat since
[1:19:59] the marriage and divorce and I listened
[1:20:04] a lot dire marriages horse and not a
[1:20:07] restoration that's a drug direct
[1:20:11] revelation straight from God proven that
[1:20:14] his message was right those seals was
[1:20:17] not restoration that was God's voice
[1:20:19] speaking through a man bringing unto you
[1:20:23] and I the revelation of God's Word
[1:20:25] things that are to be I've asked you to
[1:20:27] do it sometimes just take the book the
[1:20:30] title book sit down and go to 63 and
[1:20:32] just read from 63 own and come and tell
[1:20:36] me one title to a sermon one titled
[1:20:39] whoever sermon in there show me one over
[1:20:41] that was a negative point everyone
[1:20:43] almost positive things that are to be
[1:20:45] Christ the mystery of God reveal future
[1:20:48] home one God God of this evil age or the
[1:20:51] garden you know all of it was a
[1:20:53] revelation
[1:20:54] listen a revelation to those disciples
[1:20:58] didn't even have brother Branham didn't
[1:21:02] he come to restore back what they had
[1:21:04] within his message broke and when his
[1:21:08] message broke he brought things them
[1:21:10] disciples didn't have no way of
[1:21:11] understanding
[1:21:12] none of them priest marriage and divorce
[1:21:17] they spoke of it yeah they didn't preach
[1:21:20] it
[1:21:22] all right look the omission would be
[1:21:26] revealed in life stage itself when he
[1:21:28] begins to sound as Mason see not the
[1:21:30] years of preparation but when he gets to
[1:21:31] sound the message these misses gonna be
[1:21:35] revealed
[1:21:36] and our and here they are not knowing
[1:21:39] them and you people are witnesses go to
[1:21:41] them mrs. rapture now Here Come a tape
[1:21:47] of the seven churches which in
[1:21:50] Revelation 10 7 that the great mystery
[1:21:52] of the book was to be unfolded by the
[1:21:54] seventh angels message now here is a
[1:21:56] messenger above always and a messenger
[1:22:03] on earth he said it there's a messenger
[1:22:13] above always and a messenger on earth he
[1:22:20] went out to earn Arizona and met that
[1:22:21] messenger come on people say he's taking
[1:22:29] up and into angels and I'd like to know
[1:22:30] what he said what it was he said he's
[1:22:33] taking up near my angels if you want to
[1:22:34] find it I'll be glad to read it to you
[1:22:36] he said that they told him to go back to
[1:22:40] Jeffersonville it will be told you later
[1:22:45] you said no he knowed it's not then he
[1:22:48] lied because when he come to the first
[1:22:50] seal he said I don't know what it is I
[1:22:54] don't know what the second one is he
[1:22:58] said the Angels come daily to bring him
[1:23:02] the word it was not written in the form
[1:23:04] of riding it out had to be in the Bible
[1:23:08] don't misunderstand it look at the great
[1:23:13] mystery of the book which will be
[1:23:14] unfolded by the seven things which meant
[1:23:16] now here was a messenger above always in
[1:23:18] the messenger on earth the english word
[1:23:20] angel means a messenger in the seventh
[1:23:23] angels message while he was making his
[1:23:28] proclaiming his ministry then when he
[1:23:31] began to sound forth his ministry not
[1:23:37] when he started out when he was bringing
[1:23:43] his ministry
[1:23:45] but around his message begun in opening
[1:23:52] of the word do you understand what I'm
[1:23:54] getting at I'm playing out way to make
[1:23:58] it then veterans message
[1:24:04] nobody could bring it but him because it
[1:24:08] was his message and he had to be the
[1:24:11] prophet of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30
[1:24:13] revelation 10 7 to be able to do that
[1:24:16] couldn't be brought by anybody else now
[1:24:19] some of you sitting here note I could
[1:24:21] call the names but I won't when brother
[1:24:23] Branham come out and said now on
[1:24:26] marriage and divorce he made a statement
[1:24:29] and when he made a statement was
[1:24:32] something similar to some of you may
[1:24:34] have the wrong mate or something to that
[1:24:35] degree do you know that there was I
[1:24:37] named the brother he went out and
[1:24:40] preached because he come through here
[1:24:41] I've told years later to preached it you
[1:24:45] may not have the right wife you need to
[1:24:47] get rid of that wife and get you another
[1:24:49] one
[1:24:49] it's old lady he thought that was the
[1:24:54] marriage and divorce
[1:24:56] that was his thoughts of marriage and
[1:24:58] divorce
[1:24:59] that's just like people today what is
[1:25:01] the Seventh Seal the great revelation of
[1:25:05] polygamy you hadn't heard about that
[1:25:10] the great revelation of polygamy is what
[1:25:13] brother Branham come to bring us heaven
[1:25:18] help but listen jerko musician I'm
[1:25:25] simply trying to explain one day there
[1:25:28] was a faith of the fathers had to be
[1:25:29] restored to the church and if that's not
[1:25:31] restored to the church then we need to
[1:25:35] not even worry about the rest so we
[1:25:36] could go home play PT patter do what we
[1:25:39] want to we can sit down do what we want
[1:25:46] to or we can seriously get into the
[1:25:49] message and start studying it
[1:25:55] as brother branham said and many of you
[1:25:59] children they didn't know all about
[1:26:03] Superman's and all of this but said they
[1:26:06] even know the name of Jesus I said it
[1:26:12] I'm sorry
[1:26:13] just say it again and many of he has
[1:26:16] ever read to see a book through but yet
[1:26:22] you know all about it
[1:26:24] they mean he's read Daniel 70 weeks but
[1:26:27] you know all about it
[1:26:28] I mean he's rich statue of a perfect man
[1:26:31] but you know all about it
[1:26:32] I mean he's read adoption sometimes here
[1:26:35] um but you know all about it
[1:26:37] how can you do it without the Prophet
[1:26:40] saying God revealed it to me
[1:26:43] baloney is that plain enough that would
[1:26:48] be adding to the word converter Branham
[1:26:50] never added one word his message was not
[1:26:53] an addition to the word it was the
[1:26:56] fulfillment now listen it was the
[1:26:58] fulfillment of the entire word that's
[1:27:02] why timeless restoration promised he
[1:27:12] realized that when it says to to Eve
[1:27:15] I'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:27:17] seed of the one promised you realize
[1:27:21] that had to take place and to do it it
[1:27:25] caused Jesus his life oh yeah they
[1:27:31] wanted bread around him yeah they wanted
[1:27:36] him until he began to say I'm my
[1:27:37] father's one now watch him and he says
[1:27:42] in these other things did when he begin
[1:27:48] to preach those seals they knew nothing
[1:27:49] about what he's talking about you know
[1:27:51] why cause they were the horse or the
[1:27:55] rider I'd rather make the rider to the
[1:27:58] devil cause that's one of the horses to
[1:28:00] church how is it gonna come forth
[1:28:05] you realize where he won't he won't
[1:28:08] Cologne you realize he's gonna be only a
[1:28:14] small group I've really just a minute
[1:28:17] ago in eighth in the days of Noah right
[1:28:22] and that don't even top the church top
[1:28:27] of the church with Enoch they didn't
[1:28:30] even mention his wife I don't know where
[1:28:32] he had one and odd you know my being
[1:28:33] with his talks of Enoch one man John
[1:28:39] went to Patmos says one man to represent
[1:28:42] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:45] one man what if it hadn't have been for
[1:28:49] the messenger of Malachi for me that's
[1:28:52] why I was asked a question where we talk
[1:28:54] about the night in the Bible study
[1:28:56] that's why that's so wonderful to me
[1:28:59] when it says there in Malachi it don't
[1:29:03] start right off he's in in the Old
[1:29:05] Testament he's bringing it to a close
[1:29:07] and he says remember ye the law of Moses
[1:29:13] what's he telling man
[1:29:17] Dini talks of restoration with John
[1:29:20] turning it and in a Lodge of his day to
[1:29:23] turn it back why does he say that
[1:29:29] remember you the word because all the
[1:29:33] way through the word the restoration was
[1:29:36] promised all the way through the word
[1:29:38] the seals was promised all the way
[1:29:40] through the word the marriage and
[1:29:41] divorce was promised all the way through
[1:29:43] the word the revelation to these things
[1:29:45] was promised remember you the law of
[1:29:50] Moses
[1:29:51] why don't you think sometimes instead of
[1:29:55] being so smart you called me a smart
[1:29:58] aleck or something but what is this
[1:30:01] simple thought you could over the
[1:30:05] revelation 2:10 when they say but in the
[1:30:07] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:30:09] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:30:11] of God to be revealed why did he write
[1:30:13] that
[1:30:17] why did gone right there John was told
[1:30:24] to write what he saw and he went across
[1:30:27] then he saw the age and saw the rapture
[1:30:30] it's not the fifth chapter saw this
[1:30:32] things but then when he comes over to
[1:30:37] the tenth chapter he said look we got
[1:30:42] this angel this lame to hear this angels
[1:30:44] are the only thought who said how am I
[1:30:46] gonna get this back to the seven
[1:30:49] churches that was his key he stopped he
[1:30:53] said but in the days of the voice of the
[1:30:55] seventh angel when he begins to sound
[1:30:58] that mixture will be revealed John what
[1:31:01] is not to be may call now but in the
[1:31:07] days turned all the way back out of
[1:31:11] eternity right back down to the seven
[1:31:13] churches and said to Life Church a
[1:31:15] messenger will be a prophet well what do
[1:31:20] we got this time I pray you will listen
[1:31:27] and think on these things
[1:31:33] Oh
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:40] and renew arrived what about it
[1:31:44] within
[1:31:47] if I say that contrary to the message
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:55] one of people not want this message they
[1:32:00] throw the house somebody with something

[1:34:41] asked as it now goes down into history
[1:34:43] because we've said what we're saying and
[1:34:46] we'll have to meet it someday but we've
[1:34:50] tried to say what you say it we've tried
[1:34:54] to speak of what your prophet had to say
[1:34:58] and we give honor and glory to the man
[1:35:01] that brought the message we thank you
[1:35:04] for it but now somebody's got to take
