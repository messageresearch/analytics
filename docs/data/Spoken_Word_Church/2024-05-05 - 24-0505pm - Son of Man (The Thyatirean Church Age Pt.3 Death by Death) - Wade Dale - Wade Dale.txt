that man and and the and the Perry's being with us and and they're always welcome here uh with us and we sure appreciate them appreciate his grandfather I don't know if you know brother Benny but um met him long long time ago and that's his grandfather so he comes from a good a good pedigree so let's look and see what what God Said Today to the th tyan Church age and part three will be death by death and we'll explain that here in just a minute but death by death so let's read Revelations 1 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us in a book write it in a book and send it to the seven churches it was so important they wanted it he wanted John to write it down and give it to the churches all right why because it set the tone for every Church it set the tone for every um star is set the tone for every person that lived in those ages is set the tone for them all right Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra the one that we're talking about today Sardis Philadelphia and leosa I turned to see the voice that spake with me I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girle you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word Josh I can't get this view off of here get that header off of there brother Anderson are you closer where you tapping one button just push it how simple Revelations 2 Verse 18 thank God for support and to the angel of the church in th write these things saith the Son of God which has lies has eyes like into flames of fire and his feet like fine brass and I Know Thy works and as we were reading this morning how many times did he say Works four different times he said your Works your works and then my works not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel and we'll talk about that in just a minute which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit 40 and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not God has given every Church age that that Darkness the Blackness that you see on the on the circles he gave them a time to repent he sent him a messenger he sent us a messenger he sent us time to repent my word we've been 60s something years since the prophet's been gone off the scene we ought to be getting something by now behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation we talking about he's talking about the what the great and her Harlot children right except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death if we were going to talk about now I will kill her children with death not kill her children and they die I'm going to kill them with death and we'll see what that really means in the in the Greek in just a minute and all the churches shall know now he's talking about then all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns in heart and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say unto the rest of thyra as many as have not this Doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden in other words he's not going to like I said before there's not going to be this great Teaching Ministry there's not going to be this um there's not going to be a a a former Reign and a latter Reign all those things are given in the other ages but in their age it's just to survive be a Christian survive do their works and they got stronger as they seemingly got weaker to the world they got stronger right as they kept getting killed they got stronger in their faith that that's that's not common for me and you that that's totally contrary to our human nature come on somebody it is it's totally contrary to our human nature as we get we get more and more beat on us we get more and more worse but they get more better are better than what they were and he that overcometh and keepeth my words all right unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and the vessels of Potter of a Potter shall they break be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star we'll talk about that next Sunday he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches and like our brother said Wednesday night it's it's say what set on tape not repeat what set on tape amen get the essence of the message the essence of the message of the hour is what's going to take us out of here the letter will kill you you can sit here and read me quotes until the Rapture takes place and you're going to die and go to hell if you don't have a revelation of what that quote says a revelation of not what brother Brandon meant well he meant to say this well who you to tell him what he meant to say God and him were like together okay so we there's nobody between him to correct him only God himself but now when he comes down to me and you we have to be corrected because we're not prophets we didn't get sure I think we get the things from the mind of God as we were talking about last night the back part of God's mind was not shut up it was it was for each one of us to go into the back part of God's mind because we need to get that Vision the Bible says without a vision the people perish without a vision that you and I have listen our goal is to come to Perfection our goal is to come to where death will be destroyed and the Saints will come out of the ground and come here with us that's our goal that's our mandate it's not just to live a nice Christian Life and see how long we can live and see how long we can say amen and how long we can go to church and how long we can that's not it right there's a goal to this message of the hour and that's the revelation of the Rapture and then back it up to the revelation of the Resurrection all right and what it's all about and that we are part of that listen we're recipients of that of that Resurrection Paul's already told us we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in our soul but boy the other part is not it's sitting here wanting to go to sleep right so and you're not yet I'm just saying you know that's but that's the contrast that thing in your soul is just running m million million million miles an hour it's it's Eternal but now when you get to the spirit realm it's much slow down a little bit then when you get in the body it just reacts to what the rest of it is but remember we got to let it out we got to let it out and let it live do not keep it in let it out whatever it is if you want to start shouting and screaming and praising the Lord please do so please please do so do not say well I'm I will when brother Dy does well you may wait a while okay but maybe not but I hope that I I pray that the that the holy spirit that was that was here just now that it would saturate all of us and we'd all start screaming and shouting and we we not going to be like Pentecostal we're not going to say well we couldn't preach because because you know we just sang and no there's a time for worship there's a time to hear the word of God there but there is a time that the Holy Ghost will fall on a building and it just as brother George Quinn I never seen it till just a few minutes ago brother George Quinn said he said it becomes a Milky it's like it's it's like you lose your it's like it's fuzzy he's seen it several several times even here well that's what happened just a few minutes ago it's like I lost my contacts it just became fuzzy I hope somebody got something amen and you just claim it if you didn't feel it don't worry about it if you didn't see it don't worry about it I didn't see that but I believe it happened I didn't see the pillow of fire over brother Brown's head or the pillow of fire the other day uh somebody said they saw it going through the building not here but another place I didn't see that but remember we believe to see we don't see to believe we believe and then we see all right so let's look at this the tiing church age just for a minute it was the longest Church age it was the Dark Ages but God was still working God was still moving he was happy to be in those people that were in prison he was happy to be with those people and he knew what was going to happen to him and and as brother Bram said whoever that commentator was back way back when he was alive that that said brother brandham said said God just looked like he folded his arms up and sat back and watched everybody get killed in the Dark Ages you know what brother Brown said he said he didn't know what he was talking about he said that was the tender hand of Jehovah we don't understand that now when you read that quote you're going wait a minute but you see that that's God had to let that happen to let that go in the ground to die so that it could come back up in the next three Church ages so it had to be the continuity of God he said the seed's got to go into the ground there's got to be a time of planting well God was planting these people but it was the seed that came out in Luther Wesley and Pentecost and now in the message of the hour that's the only way we're going to get it it's for it to go into that Dark Age and for us to see though that even during that Dark Age there was a bride that physically got killed if they said they were bride physically you're not physically dead here today spiritually if you don't if you're not born again you are spiritually dead but you're dead while you're living we'll read that in just a few minutes cuz you're going to God's going to kill them with death by death right wow all right we'll look at in just a minute but we know that was Columba and we talked about this morning we know we talked about work so let's talk about that just one more one more minute because people there are a lot of people that does say well now you know if you got one side over here that says if you don't have any emotion you're dead Okay anything you can't move is dead that's what they say and then over here you got these people that just toled out a whistle and they shout and scream and and you don't get anything done wordwise but what do we do we bring it to the middle to where we have faith if we have faith it will show itself because the scripture says in James 2 course this is the ox age or the age of Works what does an ox do an ox works all right even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone so if you separate the two oh I've got works oh I've got faith it's like car and gasoline they do you no good separate but when you put them together they fire the car so now we look at Faith I've got faith and my works are going to show that I got faith or that I don't all right so now listen yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works all right for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also all right look at what brother Brown says now here again we find the same introduction I Know Thy works the Son of God himself said believe me for the very Works sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did but now remember he stood one day and he said the works I do you shall do also all right so he has transferred that that that we're going to have healing we're going to have Hey listen we're going to have multiplication of bread we're going to have limbs restored we're going to have dead raised and we've had had it before we have had it so so it's not something uncommon we have had it all right so he puts an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God look to inspire faith in him all right it was a great part of his ministry but now remember it was a first part just as brother brandom's first part of his ministry was Works hello somebody the first part of his ministry was 50,000 people thousand people in every service would be healed or hundreds of people would be healed right but he had faith and having the faith he had the work showed that he had faith and what is he doing he said get the people he said get the people the angel said get the people to believe you right then you'll see the works see but that was a special Ministry I don't have to stand here today and said now look you got to believe in me no you got to have faith for yourself I'll bind my faith with yours and everybody else will bind their faith and then what we'll see the works that comes from that I believe that truly believe that for we are his workmanship Paul said now work workmanship we working for it all right created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of Faith now watch it will never take the place of God of faith in God for our Salvation right CU remember here's where we stand to where we say Okay XYZ I did as the Pentecostal said I spoke in tongues I must have the Holy Ghost no brother Brown said the great what was the great um mystery in the end time was to receive the new birth without what sensation ah no works but once you get born again oh come on works here we go and it's the true works it's not you're trying to work it up right we're not trying to work it up Pentecostals tried to work it up brother BR said they tooted it after whistle another words they they put so much emphasis on the works and emotion and all that till they didn't even they didn't want to hear Brother Ram's sermon come on many people that was in his in his uh Services said we were just waiting to the end to get to the to see the signs and wonders well they missed the whole sermon that's why it took us 60 years to get everything back together no offense to anybody but it just wasn't time it time it's time now though yes but works will show forth our faith already placed in him so you got to have faith first yes are your works are no good like I said there's many people work work work work work work work ain't got the new birth well somewhere they're going to run out of gas but you and I that are born again we should never run out of gas they should always be we should always be looking for works we should always be looking to let hands on the sick and they shall recover we should always be looking at well that person needs something in their life God let me pray with them that's what we're here for but they will come forth oh good works won't save you all right but they will come forth out of a saved life yes as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good work brother Brandon was very one I know he did believe in good work even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can that's right what is horrible is the sight of God in the sight of God is for men to do evil works and then say they're doing the will of God now just as the pope stood up and said if you don't fall before the Catholic church and if you don't pray in front of this crucifix you're going to die that's what happened that's where the 68 million people died it wasn't drunk fighting drunks it wasn't the unsaved fighting the saved so to say it was the church fighting the church are the church fighting a bride and they say they're doing the will of God in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed life listen get your life changed first and the quietness of the hour ask God to come into your life don't worry about if you hear bells and whistles and and and works comes that's great that works would come I I would and Paul even said I would that you would speak in tongues but you don't have to ain't that what he say in the Bible I would that you do that I would that you would do that that let God utter through you something that nobody else can understand it should be for yourself in a church sitting but brother Bram spoke in tongues remember in the room he said I heard somebody and I thought they was speaking in tongues he said it was me well he was that was speaking in tongues for himself all right you say what are you saying about speaking speaking in tongues listen speaking in tongues is part of the is part of the seven spirits okay tongues and interpretation we should be able to use them all but I think sometimes listen just for a second I think sometimes we're scared I think sometimes we're scared because there was so much brother R said about order of speaking in tongue right and how it should be used and how it should not be used and how that if it's used wrong there's a spirit in the church I think we're all like I don't know if I want to do this or not you know and you might have the unction to do it well if it's of God you're quenching the spirit let it rip amen we'll correct it if he needs correcting I think we know enough a conduct order and Doctrine to tell when it needs to be corrected or not amen just let the Spirit fall like it did a few minutes ago and I'll guarantee if we stayed here long enough somebody would have probably started speaking in tongue cuz it was just so strong it was it was a u I hadn't felt it in a long time but praise God I hope you did too men saw their good works and glorified God their Works testified to a new spirit within yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right okay your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't do something it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life brother Brown said works is Faith expressed the Lord tells us that I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first brother R said this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor rooll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith in increase that's just really a paradox that's just something that we're not used to cuz when we we start getting beat on what do we do find a place hide we don't stand up bold and say hey satan I'm here all right we're no match for him I know that but their Works their faith with the works attached to it defeated the devil in that church age because Satan would have wiped them out Satan would wiped me and you out Satan wants us all dead this whole building he would love for it to disappear he would love for it to disappear but praise God we find somebody else that's in love with us more than the devil is the Lord Jesus is in love with us so much he ain't going to let that happen he ain't ever going to let that happen but we got to attach oursel to him as brother Ernie says we plugged oursel into the Eternal the harder they worked all the harder they served all the more in their Faith increased how tragic it was in the in the Ephesian age when love W remember it said you've lost your first love and truly nothing has said of the increased labor of love in the other ages so there's nothing talked about in other ages about increasing as the church age gets longer remember all the other ones decreased as the church age got longer remember went up then the church age came in and it started going what started going down then God sent a porter to catch the message and pick it back up but in this age he says but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there's no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service nobody likes to get sick right we do not like to get sick you you know you just can't get up in the morning and say all right devil if you're going to make me sick just go ahead no usually we get up feeling pretty bad anyway if we're older and got some um ailments about us but say Lord increase my faith increase my faith right remember that remember that story that brother R told and I love that story that guy's coming in you know he's he's coming into a community and he's getting all this building ready and he's putting hammering nails and he's nailing stuff up the guy goes by and says you better be careful said that guy over there said said you uh you going to have to speak to him because he's he don't like preachers and he don't like the Lord and he don't like church service and you better watch what you're doing well remember he met the guy and the guy come in he said look buddy if you going to have something in this community you going to have to go through me well the old preacher didn't say well I'm just let me go pray about this he rolled his sleeves up and he started in the guy and he said I must fight to rain I must fight to rain and he kept beating the guy and finally got the guy saved in one of the meetings so don't cow down to the devil like that don't do that just say Lord increase my faith teach me Lord how to wait upon you but our reply should be always increase service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory that is time to shout the victory brother R said I want to give you a warning here it says concerning the last day now he's he's come up to us that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will watch cold and the L ofy and or last AG self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we see it everywhere everywhere we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit have you and I been caught up in that think about it have we been caught up in that in that lay out of sin LAX easy go whatever happens you know no you got to fight to win so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effects of this last day spirit it's time to draw nigh to God and let him our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day Church oh please don't let that happen please let the P I want the power of God like it was a few minutes ago in every church service I want to expect it in every church service and I want I don't want me to be the one that brings it I want you to be the one that brings it you bring it with you you bring your fire let's see what happens or we will feel the coldness of the last State church and we'll reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us the truth that help us we reject it like I said before the first time we get in bad situation or or um there's two things if you get in money trouble which is your fault anyway Amen Brother John amen your fault anyway there's one thing the devil can't do either he can't get in your pocketbook you got to let him in I'm going to preach now okay okay he's the one that get he he's not the one that I don't even have my bill phone he's the one he's he's not the one that reaches in and gets them dollar bills out of your bill phone who does that you do it right amen you do it and usually ain't dollar bills usually it's a credit anyway credit card so anyway so who's our biggest enemy we are we're our biggest enemy we're our biggest we're our biggest issue what issues do you have me everybody say me I heard some of you say you no it's all of us but it's like that quote just said it can you live it though when nobody sees you but God see to me that's the fire that's the Thunder as brother Brown said that's the Thunder that makes the devil back up he cannot stand a lived life of God even though be whacked and beat he can come and and like job I'm sure the devil was like just let me add him I'll make him curse you and the Lord's going okay all right you just can't take his life and the more he put on job the more job stood up and said I know my redeemer liveth it's just something Satan can't understand he's said listen he has a defeated mentality but he has tried to to uh trick himself into believing he can win cuz he's not the Creator the Creator's inside of me and you I want you to understand that there's not a God standing up here in Heaven There is but there's not a god up there and he's nowhere else he shed abroad his heart his life he shed a broad out into me and you to what to defeat the Devil no other purpose but to defeat him and we're going to defeat him in the flesh that Satan supposedly defeated Us in in the garden hello somebody right we're going to take a body change Satan can't take a body change Satan can't raise the dead Satan can't kill you so let's look just for a second then we'll get into this it was a dominating female or church now watch how it started remember we went to Ephesus it started in Ephesus as the worship of Diana all right which is a woman and a female types to what the church and th now that was a propheus that sat on a three-legged stool three legs three-legged stool and prophesied supposedly what God or who whoever it was said and then in our age look how it's come up to now it's the great wh and her daughters it's always a she it's always the church so the city of thyra had many rivers and they look very beautiful the the commentator said but by the time you dived in and come out you had leeches all over you think of the leeches that were in that church age it was called the Catholic Church they tried to suck the life out of Satan tried to suck the life out of you doesn't he that's what a leech does a leech attaches itself to you does you no good but sucks the life out of you the worship was of Apollo the son God spoke to a propheus who sat on a three-legged chair and delivered a message and you had to belong to that Temple or you were persecuted you can't according to the history you couldn't have a a a business unless you were attached to the church that church that Temple that worship not the worship of God the worship of their God which was Apollo now watch not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou has sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed unto Idols I was talking brother um Bautista in the back Wednesday night and his his his thought was exactly true we know that for a fact but you realize something that Elijah all right now Elijah Elijah stood one day and said the dogs will lick your blood right he didn't see that he didn't see that but he pronounced judgment on her brother Ram stood and pronounced judgment on the church amen but who saw her defeated who saw her die Elisha the bride we see the culmination of he indicted this generation but we see the end he gave these prophecies but we see the end Elijah made these promises but Elisha saw the end of Jezebel so that's what we're going to see we're going to see the end of Jezebel in US now we know that's going straight through into the tribulation but it's going to be away from us this Jezebel system is not going to touch the bride of Christ so they suffered that woman Jezebel which we should not which means they allowed it to happen they got a little LAX and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they rep repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death all right everybody with me Bible says in first Timothy we're going to get in the Bible here in just a minute we're going to run through pretty quick 1 Timothy 5:6 but say she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth that's a paradox we look at people and if they've passed on they ain't breathing they're in a casket they're dead right but this quote is telling us that there is there is a she that's going to be breathing moving doing but she's dead so let's read what will the punishment of the Harlot be and her children well it's going to be twofold first he said I will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be in a bed of tribulation or the Great Tribulation we know that the great and her children are going through the tribulation all right you know what they even know they're going through the tribulation remember you left behind in all those different movies it's all a lie it's all a lie it's all doctrinal issues that come from a pull pit that says we're going to have three and a half years of major Tri tribulation three and a half years of minor if you don't make it in the first three and a half you'll make it in the next one well that's a lie if you're here when the bombs start falling you have missed it you will be here until you die and you go into the white Throne judgement you ain't going to try to figure out how to make it we had a a guy in the message he said he's trying to figure out how to make it through the tribulation I said so am I but mine ain't like yours I ain't building bunkers and buying silver and gold I'm figuring out how to just completely miss the whole thing all right amen we all are I mean it's kind of crazy you an ounce of gold is what $3,000 something dollars and it's just a little old piece about this big right that an ounce I said 'what are you going to do I said you got an ounce of gold what are you going to do you're going to go to the you're going to go to the gas station and say I need about $20 worth of no they're going to take that whole bar away from you so let's just figure out how to make it before the Rapture I mean before the tribulation takes place and we ain't got to figure out how to make it and buy all these meals ready to eat and all that other garbage come on we got a message that'll get us out of here we got a word of God that'll get us way above that promised we'd not even bomb fall till we got out of here now we might be persecuted we might be shot we might be put in prison but praise God we're not going to go through the tribulation that is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 1-13 there were 10 versions five were wise five were foolish the five wise had oil the Holy Ghost but the other five did not when the crowd went out behold the bridegroom cometh the five fool now listen the five foolish heard the call are you with me the five foolish heard the call and they were virgins unless the Bible's Wrong five foolish virgins now they may have been virgins but they were foolish but they heard the cry the world outside go out there and go to YouTube and put in end time oh you'll get hundreds of videos of this one's this one's opinion of this and this one's opinion of that and you got one guy looks like a rabbi you got one guy looks like a goon you got you got you got women you know with hair short as mine and they're they're all got their opinion but they're all saying one thing it's near it's close they see some of the pieces of the puzzle coming together and they're hearing the cry but remember they're hearing the Cry of not a bridegroom they're hearing this but it's not to them we marry him cuz we Are Born Again by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord the five foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went on into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the Rapture that is what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death now watch this the literal translation is let them be put to death with death let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man let a man be put to death by hanging by El execution or some other way but this says let them put be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death right think about that I want you to see this clearly so I'll take our illustration again of the daughter of Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah and thereby bringing it right into idolatry and causing God to deliver Judah to death you remember that happened in the Bible this is what balum did so here was Jezebel with her paganism over there was Judah look properly worshipping God and living under the word but when when Jezebel sent her daughter to marry what happened watch this over there in Judah properly worshiping God so Jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram the minute that happens jehoram causes the people to become idolators the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead we look back in that third Church age it means thoroughly married when that church age got married when church and state come together they died never will they resurrect again spiritual death came in the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died right the minute that the lutherans organized death came in and they died the Pentecost was boy now he stirred up a hornet's nest right here cuz about 90% of them in his congregation was Pentecostals the Pentecostals came up but he didn't mind saying it did he the Pentecostals came along last last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it that's right but he did that marriage brought death then the light of the Oneness of the God had come they organized they died now watch him watch him watch him bring this in show who he is but never mention his name watch so they organized and they died now this is a Pentecostal age then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 1933 a healing Revival swept the world but it never came through any organization God went outside the Pentecostal group outside of organization and what he's what he is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization too God can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon so you see death our organization came and the church died or to make it plainer death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors nanism and bism propagated by Jezebel got to have three Now Eve should have been burned along with a serpent for her awful deed but Adam intervened taking her quickly to himself in other words took upon himself her sin so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone to the full course of the ages now that's what we're looking at right now yes there will be no one to intervene right and she will be burned with her Seducer for the and her children and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their place in the Lake of Fire amen Hall all right now we're going to read some scriptures now look under the law let's set the stage here for a minute we're going to talk about death by death all right strange thing but that's what brother bam said and that's what it means in the scripture and I will kill her with death all right let's see what this death is now we know for a fact we are looking at death now as far as quit breathing we got to put you in in a in a casket and put you in the ground or cremate or whatever more and we don't see you you disappear all right so that's that's what we call humanly we call death all right but the Bible then tells us that we're dead while we're alive you could be sitting here today without a new birth you're dead and you're just breathing and you can go run 200 miles or whatever you do you're dead all right so now look let's look at what the law tells us about death everybody with are you ready come cuz you fixing to get an eye opener some of you need one already under the law Exodus 21:12 he that smiteth a man so that he die he shall surely be put to death no court now we know there's Provisions we know as that we go on the further there's cities that you can run into Refuge cities but you got to wait till the priest dies before you get out of that City so you still got to wait till somebody dies all right he that smileth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death well that's thinning the crowd out a little bit hey we fixing get and he that curses his father or his mother what this is the Old Testament if they heard you cursing at your parents you died physical death right cuz you got to remember in the Old Testament remember there was Grace we know that but it wasn't Grace like what we got when since Jesus Christ all right cuz were born he was born under the law under the law you do this you don't do that all right keep keep reading you ready it gets better you shall keep the Sabbath for it is Holy unto you everyone who don't come to church amen some of y'all going to die shall surely be put to death and I'm not I'm I'm I said that to make it a little bit softer but if you didn't go if you did something listen there was a guy picked up sticks on the Sabbath day and they stoned him because the law said to do it what every time this happened though it wasn't just because God loved death he wanted to keep his church clean come on somebody he wanted to keep it clean that's why he got rid of the hor mongers he got rid of the people that killed people he got rid of the PE the sorry he got rid of the kids that were disobedient to their parents everyone that defil it shall surely be put to death for whosoever does any work therein that Soul shall be cut off from among his people six days may work be done but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest holy to the Lord whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day he shall surely be put to death everybody all right with that you shouldn't be all right Leviticus 20: 10 but this is the Bible listen folks this is the this is what they lived under just like we live under the laws now all right speeding drinking driving blah blah blah killing murdering actually a lot of our laws come from this right most of our laws were designed from the from the Old Testament everybody know that I mean they were modified a little bit but they surely were taken from the same thing cuz you look now watch this right here now we fixing the thin the crowd out just a little bit more and the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife even he that committeth adultery with his neighbors wife wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death whoa A man also or woman that hath a familiar Spirit uh-oh or as a wizard shall surely be put to death they shall Stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them Leviticus 24:16 he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord now we really thin in the crowd out now amen you talk about how they use the lord's name in vain and all that stuff out in the world if you'd have heard that in the in the camp of the Jews you'd have died and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord he shall surely be put to death and all the congregation shall certainly Stone him as well the stranger as he that is born in the land when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord he shall be put to death that was the people outside the camp now watch this and when the Tabernacle sth forward the Levites shall take it down in other words when they got ready to move all right cuz remember what happened to the man with a cart David brought it in by the cart instead of by the by the priest and he he tried to he tried to do Works he tried to do Works he put his arms on that Arc and died immediately CU God said Whoever touched it even an animal touch it they die and the Levites shall take it down when the Tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall set it up and the the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death pretty stringent Joshua 1:16 and they answered Joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whether soever thou sendest us we will go according as we hearkened un Moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the Lord thy God be with thee as he was with Moses whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment whosoever he be that in other words becomes contrary to H Joshua whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of good courage judges 16:30 Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life but because of his transgression he had to die that death because of his transgression it stayed with him because they poked his eyes out his eyes didn't come back but his strength did his his hair grew again he said Lord just one more time so in his death he slew more he killed more then he slew in his lifetime Psalms 56:13 for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death wil thou Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the living Psalms 11615 says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints proverb 14:11 says the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the Tabernacle of the right shall what flourish there is a way which seeth right unto man but the end thereof are the ways of death there is a way that seeth right but the end thereof are the ways of death Ecclesiastes 7 verse1 a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth Isaiah 28:18 says your Covenant with Death Shall be dis anold and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing Scourge shall pass through then you shall be trotten down by it your Covenant with Death Shall be disowned now let's go over in to the New Testament now we know what Jesus Christ did he brought what he brought as in his death he brought life yes right all right verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life y'all must eat a lot of pasta today John 8 verse 51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my sayings now watch now Jesus lied if we take it like that read it ver verely verily I say unto you if a man keep my says he shall never see death we got Graves full of them if that's what he's talking about he's not talking about that he's he said y'all gonna fall asleep but you're not going to see death cuz you're going to die now you're going to die now the dead in Christ arise first yes then said the Jews unto him now we know that thou Hast a devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayith if man keep my sayings he shall never taste of death see they didn't get the they didn't get the Revelation acts 2:23 him being delivered by the determinant counsel and for knowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked hands crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of death they talk about Christ loose the Pains of death oh death where's your sting oh Graves where's your Victory because it was not possible that he should be holding of that death in other words acts 22:4 Paul says now talk about Grace we were talking about Grace the other day Paul persecuted this way unto death binding and delivering into prison both men and women he persecuted this way the Christians unto the death binding and delivering into prison both men and women Romans 5:10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our lord Jesus by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore look as by one man sin entered into the world world and death by sin that was who Adam all right and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there's no law nevertheless death reigned I just read it to you from Adam to Moses even over them that hath not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense now watch this gets confused if you don't stop from a minut so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one Adam many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift of Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ had abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses to justification in other words Jesus Christ died one time all right died once for all to justify us for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ Romans 5:19 for it's by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous now watch moreover the law entered what I just read you the law entered and it was full of death pure like real death like killing you that the offense might abound but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound praise God that has sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus our lord praise God for Paul know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death this is the baptism of scripture therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death in other words the dead in Christ yes all right that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection as Brother Anderson and different ones said their scripture their whole scripture they couldn't pick one but it was Romans 8 it takes you from from the from the new birth to adoption to a body change change just in one just in one chapter there in Romans 8 so Romans 6:8 says now if we be dead with Christ all right now listen that's not not breathing that's right that's not killing like they did in the Old Testament that's dead to yourself The Old Man Died all right Dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death ha no more dominion over him death doesn't have dominion over a Christian if you look at it right like sister Johnny looked at us just yesterday and she said I am not afraid to die see I am not afraid of death I am just not when you come to that as brother Tom F Bush says you got the goods if you're afraid of dying you need to get born again knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no More Death hath no more dominion over him now where's he living at now he's living inside of me and you for in that he died he died once under sin but in that he liveth he liveth un God likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead now here we go dead not dead not breathing dead right but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it and the lust thereof neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead those that are alive from the dead right and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you do you believe that say that with me those of you that are awake for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace cuz by law you commit them things I told you I'm not going to say it but it thin a crowd out it really would it thin a crowd out you all that I mean that wasn't all of it there was a lot of other things in there that I could have brought in different things you do and you just died you know but thank God for Grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid in other words Paul said we're not under the law as far as that death is but he said now wait a minute you can't just do what you want to over here all right God forbid know you not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you are to whom you obey that's right whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness Romans 6 verse 21 for what fruit had you then in those things wherein you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death all right but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is what death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord now what did Brother Bram say sin was unbelief right there not smoking drinking it's not even false Doctrine that's it's not believ in the true Doctrine sin equals unbelief now watch now here we go death by death and we'll be finished right here because in that th tyan age God said I'm going to kill them with death death for death kind of unusual and I will kill her children now remember what we were just talking about all those scriptures there was an actual real death right where your your your soul went out of your body your body went into the ground uh you died all right then there was a part over here that you were dead while you were living in other words you were breathing living human being but you were dead inside and then there's a group over here that if you're dead in Christ hello somebody if you're dead in Christ you have eternal life that's right all right so you got your three now but now watch what he's going to do and I will kill her children with death whose children the horse children the harlots and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works Romans 7:4 says wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ so remember Grace Grace is abounding now right that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead in other words your first husband the Dead all right that you should be married to another who Christ even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law do and don'ts by the law did work in our members members to bring forth fruit unto this kind of death which was death while you're still alive everybody with me all right I'll be just a minute then we'll take communion but now we are delivered from the law not doing away from doing away with it am all right but magnifying it making it where you can live it because it's got Grace on it all right but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter all right what shall we say then here's the great summation is the law sin God forbid nay I had not known sin but by the law just like we were talking about last night the age of accountability you say when is that age of accountability when you we can't judge it you kids you all you got to know when you come to the age of accountability cuz remember the age of accountability is knowing right from wrong and having a conscious about it that's right as I said before like little little Khloe back there Khloe's only you know four years old or so or five six oh my word six years old she getting there but if she steals a cookie and lies and tells Mama that she didn't steal it she's covered cuz she don't have a conscience of that but she is getting too a conscious of that though that something inside of her is going if I don't tell this lie I'm going to get with it right but now that's not the age of accountability the age of accountability is when you get to your age of 12 13 14 15 years old when you really know that you shouldn't do that that you should not do that and you should not say those words and you should not do the look at the things you look at you should not go to the places you amen that's when your conscience Comes Alive N I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covet now this is Paul but sin taken occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of concubines which is different things for without the law sin was dead in other words if there was no law back there in in um Moses's time think what would have happened they would have been disorganized they would have they would Tor you know they' let anybody in the temple they let they let people commit adultery let let they just be killing each other and there'd be no law right but there was a law given because there was not Grace yet through Jesus Christ you understand what I mean there was Grace but there was not grace through Jesus Christ cuz he had not come yet but sin taken occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of concubines for without the law sin was dead for I was alive without the law once but when the command commment came sin revived and I died now Paul didn't right different kind of death and the Commandment which was ordained to life I found it to be death doing the wrong thing not death but death here listen folks when Paul was persecuting those Christians he was dead in his soul you can't tell me there was eternal life in Paul's soul and him persecuting those Christians no he was evil he said he was evil he said he did those things it wasn't a commentation from somebody else or thirdhand information he wrote in the Bible and told us that he was that way Romans 713 says was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it may appear sin worketh death in me what death not dying but worketh death in Me by that which is good watch that sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful in other words you're going to die you're going to die the death if you sin that way all right Romans 8 verse5 watch this for they that are after The Flesh do mind of things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death what kind of death not in here yes so what's God telling us when he's going to kill them with death by death he's going to let death reign in their members and then what she's going to do is he's going to kill them for being dead death by death for I will kill them with death he's going to let death reign in their members but he's going to give them a time to repent but he knows they're not going to come on now he knows they're not going to he gives them a time but the death that they have is what's going to kill him he's going they're going to come to the Judgment with that death inside and God's going to kill them because remember we'll read it in just a minute we'll talk about it watch hang on minute just real quick for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace 1 Corinthians 15:21 for Since By Man Came Death Adam but my by man came also the resurrection of the Dead Jesus Christ for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive while you're living alive alive James 1:15 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringing forth death not this death but the death in here Revelations 2:1 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death what is the second death Revelations 20:6 says blessed and holy is he that hath parted in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years Revelations 2014 death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death I thank God that the Holy Fire of God has burned us out yes we've been to the lake fire the fire of God not that fire but remember tongues of what fell on them on day of Pentecost Tong of fire death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire that's the second death we as a Christian we die and then we don't die anymore we fall asleep we read that last night in Thessalonians it talks about being asleep talks about Steven falling to sleep and brother R said a Christian can't die we fall asleep this thing dies but remember this has no Dominion if this thing inside is the is the Holy Ghost yes sir cuz this inside of me is what's going to bring me up Amen in this that was corruptible that's right oh praise God what a mighty God we serve somebody used to say that what a mighty God we serve that we look and see that God's going to kill literally kill people by their own death but when we die to ourself we're alive in Jesus Christ listen we die to live yes we die to live Jesus Christ lived to die so that we can die to live if we die here not there because the second death you go into the Lake of Fire you're done that's Pastor that's white Throne judgment you don't go n that you're done why because you died here and stayed dead listen we're all dead huh we're all dead while we're living but when we will put our faith in who died and Calvary so that we can live we walk now in newness of life and we're more alive now than we ever have been you say oh brother Tatum's in the grave no his his shell is but he's not that's right sometimes we don't understand that we get it wrong just like what we said just now now the Bible says that just have a have a party at the death of a saint but cry when a baby's born we just do it totally backwards pretty little baby bless his heart well it's dead it's dead while it's alive but praise God they get eternal life if they come to if they don't come to the age accountability we understand that all right that's by the grace of God Amen but when they come to the age of accountability if they don't give their life life to God that death that's inside of them God's going to kill them with that death and that's what he did in that third in that fourth Church age he killed them by the very death that he let them go through listen he lets every one of us go through that we're all dead if you never come to the knowledge of the truth there's no sacrifice for that you're dead and if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost there's no life for you anyway let's stand to our feet he kills them by death and when God kills you be careful but when the Holy Ghost in fire burns that out of you kills the old man that's a lot different love the Lord God's good isn't he to give us a revelation of what's going to happen and how we die you look in the Bible that ain't even that's not even just I think 490 something times it talks talks about death I didn't even look up dying died and dead I just look up death it was 490 something times death's all in the Bible but if you'll get over here on this side of death get this death the death of self then you'll be alive in Christ you stay over here and you stay over here you're dead while you're living and God will actually kill you by the death that's inside of you cuz remember who killed kill a soul only one person can kill a soul right who is that the Lord and that's what's going to happen is we're going to be killed by death can you pull the scripture up or I or I can read it but if you pull it up we can all read it he love the Lord thank God for the word thank God for what he's give us and you know what I thank God for what he's going to give us cuz we're sitting here right here in just in the moment of time when Anything Can Happen 6 months from now this PL this thing could collapse and we' have nothing be nothing or we can go on a little while that's for the Lord to decide but you know what you and I better get ready for that moment get ready now CU remember the bride went in and got married the other ones went somewhere else they were too late even though they were virgins even though they're going to be given eternal life they're going to have to go through the tribulation period whatever you do don't don't don't don't go through the tribulation period let's read for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord this death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body in Blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself that's what we do every month when we take communion we examine oursel and we we let we let our um we go back into our hard drive and we see all the things that we've done some of the things that we needed to take care of some of the things we already took care of but you only know that yourself you you have your own hard drive we can't get into yours and you can't get into ours but God can for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves that's what we talking about this morning we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord what we read the scripture we read the Bible that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if a man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come the Corinthians were making a great big Feast out of it they were getting drunk they were eating they were making a mess out of it and calling it The Lord's table and Paul had to come in and say hold on a minute this is what the Lord did when he was in the upper room so this is what you need to do all right so let's have a moment of Silent prayer praying for each other getting our sin out of the way and being able to take Comm Union with a contrite heart help us Lord through this furtherment of the service Lord and help us as we continue on in life and Lord as we come together Lord each time lord may we remember you father not even the days that we take communion but let us remember you Lord that you died for for us you died so that we could live you died a death that there was no breath in your body so that you could live because you were the soul of God you couldn't die Lord you raised from the dead with that same soul and then on the day of Pentecost you poured it back into your people and Lord we stand here today to do the ordinances that you've commanded us to do the water baptism the the communion and the foot wash and different things that you commanded us to do Lord that keeps the worshiper clean and keeps the church running Lord and functioning father I pray that you'd bless each one sanctify us for the journey that we're on Lord and the one that we're continuing forgive us of our sins Lord and give us Grace father for the things that we that we are not doing right Lord that that are wrong in your eyes Lord just Lord forgive us Lord for being humans and help us Lord and teach us to do the right thing father we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen the Lord took bread and he blessed it Lord Jesus thank you so much for this bread Lord made with holy hands father I pray Lord that it will uh be taken Lord in solemn Lord that we know that your body had many holes in it Lord and and and a spear in his side and Lord you were beat like as the prophet said hamburger meat but you did it all for us Lord but just a few days later you came out of that grave Lord and you were not broken anymore but you did still show the scars but those scars are for us Lord and thank you so much Lord that we can go to to Glory father in the glorified body that's not scarred Lord I Thank you in Jesus name amen what a wonderful thing he's going to be walking around with scars and we're not don't worry if you had an operation you're not going to have a scar when you get over there they didn't work on your glorified body they worked on the body of your mom and daddy gave you right praise the Lord I like that song by Casting Crowns and one they saying was good too but um the only scars in heaven won't belong to me and you all the old will be made new the only scars in heaven will be him you know what every time we see him we're going to know he's Eternal God we know that but he's going to hold his hands out like this and I'm going to go oh yeah that was for me and then as I continue on for millions of years we come back and see the Lord again and he says hey friend I want to know he that happened for me it'll be an eternal example of what he did for me and you that he didn't have to do he wasn't coerced into doing it he gave his life so that you and I could have life dear heavenly father thank you for this wine Lord I pray that it'll sanctify our body father Lord we'll take it Lord and know that your blood was shed for us at Calvary Lord and the life that was in that blood is what is important that came back to the Believers Lord and I pray that you'd bless the Believers today Lord just saturate us with the Holy Spirit Lord thank you for your presence today that we've that we felt father that that we know one things for sure that that you're Sovereign and you do things that any way you want to do them but Lord if we'll get in a an honest and a contrite heart and we'll get in the in the place Lord that we can hear from you father you'll come down and visit us father just bless us now in the furtherment of this service in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest Neath the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long but I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I'll walk by the river I'll rest neath the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the [Music] midnight come morning there's glory for me if you feel bad sometimes I'm despised and re the world hates us and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on I would say that the the martyrs during this church age they gave their physical life because they'd already been born again so they they knew that they were protected of the second death but I wonder what they saying I don't believe they were sad if if the Bible tells us that they got stronger as they got thrown into the liones den their faith got stronger I believe they sang a little louder they might have had an a few apprehension or a few times that they were at first that when they started putting them in prison and and then they sentenced them to death that there was a little apprehension but but I believe somebody stood up and preached him a sermon and said hey this is what we're called to just like I'm telling you today this is this is what we're called to we're called to come to adoption and then to a change of a body get the dead out of the ground and then take a body change and then as the Bible says we can just meet together and we'll go up to meet the Lord in the air we'll just move into another dimmension a faster Dimension and we will uh have fun while the world goes through a Great Tribulation does that make it clear where he says I'll kill him with death I'll kill him with death absolutely he told us exactly what he was going to do but what what the whole thing is was he let them do it because of the death that they took on false Doctrine he let them die he gave them a chance to repent you read the Bible I gave him a chance but they didn't so I'm must I'm going to you know God's a good God but God's a god he's a just God you turn him down you die just the way it is let's take okay okay while they're taking up the uh um rest of the communion bow sister Anna Mara wants to come get a prayer cloth and uh we'll pray over that while uh while they're taking up the communion cups dear heavenly father our sister we don't have to explain what it this prayer cloth is Lord she doesn't have to even tell us what it's for Lord but it will accomplish by the faith that we have it will accomplish what it said in the Bible that many of the claws from Paul were laid on people and and many healings were wrought demons were cast out and the different things Lord I pray that when this cloth is laid wherever it needs to be laid Lord that it'll do exactly what our sister said it would do in the name of Jesus Christ amen you know the Bible tells us whoever sins you retain they retain whoever sins you remit they're remitted do do you believe that when Steven was dying when Steven was getting ready to fall asleep Paul was standing just a few feet away he didn't pick the stones up but he held the coats and the and he says I consented in other words I didn't say now come on guys we don't need to do this this is a nice guy no he consented he had a little fire in his belly said all well we get rid of that one ah come on he was right there consented to the death holding the coats Steven looks up into heaven and he says father forgive them that was for Paul all those other ones I don't know if it was or not but it was for Paul whatever sins you retain they retain whatever ones you remit they remit he released Paul you say oh that was just Steven that Steven was Christ at that moment he was portraying Christ to the people one of the first Martyrs that that was a believer that was a a born again believer and he meant it from his heart he said father don't hold that against them that was for Paul and you know what I believe old Saul later on in his life he probably heard that same word again and it by re ation he said wow that was for me that was for me when Jesus Christ said forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing that was for me that was for me in my sin in the first part of our Lives all of us we sinned fell short of the glory of the Lord Paul said he did but when we realize it though we look back and we can see as you see Steven that life had to come through the body and that forgiveness not only comes through Jesus Christ it comes through you and me who ever sends you remit remit whoever remain there remain or remit one of the two they asked brother BR said brother BR you you told them people their sins were forgiven talking about marriage and divorce he said not too far from being God the Bible says that we can forgive them amen I mean he was just reading the Bible he wasn't trying to be a great prophet outside the Bible you could just turn the Bible over and said hey man right here's where it says whoever sins you remit they remit whoever say you retain they're retained or remit one of the two it's up to you you see how important we are not to pass judgment so fast on people let's read the scripture for the for the uh foot washing you love the Lord he's good to us today supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his car at Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment took a towel and GED himself and after that he poured water in a basin and began to wash the disciples feet I don't know about your sisters downstairs but upstairs when I hear that water going into that Basin it takes me back 2,000 years cuz if we had have been there you'd have been able to hear that same bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop praise God what a mighty God we serve after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to WIP them with the towel who withth he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed Heth not saved to be washed but is clean every with and you are clean but not all he knew Judas was there for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after that he washed their feet had taken His Garment was sat down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am you know many times he he said don't don't worship me during his life he said he said no no no don't he should worship God but when he comes here to the end of his life when he comes here to where he knows that he don't just have few hours to live he said now if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you ought to also wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you he said you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am so he was telling them identifying him before he was leaving that he was their Master he was their Lord but if I your master should wash your feet you should wash each other's feet the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that has sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things say it with me please happy are ye if you do them let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for the day that we've had for the visitation Lord of your spirit father and thank you for the word that we've heard Lord I pray that you just sink it into all of our hearts we all need it Lord we all need your presence Lord but we also need the word of God inside of us Lord to work and to do as we said Lord to show fruit and to do Works Lord that that the world can see that we're Christians and we're different father I pray that You' be with us in the furtherment of this foot washing service thank you for blessing us with the communion service Lord and and also with a um child dedication Lord I pray that you'd bless the pares Lord and be with them Father we appreciate them with the love of the Lord and we pray that you just bind them together father I pray that you'd bind us together as a church group father and just bless us as our journey continues Lord we ask you to bless the ones that are sick and not here Lord just take care of each each one we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you your dismissed sisters go downstairs
