========================================

for me because I've never tried this song outside of the shower in my patrol cars usually um but I did want to say one real quick thing that I've been going through a lot of trouble here lately both emotionally physically and everything like that and I knew that today was coming up that I had to sing and I had no idea I had bouncing other songs around in my mind had one and I'm saying well Paul and Nate but I was ironing my clothes this morning thinking I said Lord I have no idea what I'm going to sing and uh one of my favorite groups has always been the kingsman and there's one song that I've always loved more than anything else it's The Old Ship of Zion and I know that you should this song sounds better if you have a quartet singing it but I'm going to do my best and of course the musicians can just stand down because they're never going to be able to hang with me on this song because I'm going to go up down every which way okay I sing it as my heart sees it and the way I the way I've always seen this if any of y'all know the song and I hope all of you do I've always seen myself as that ship as being beaten battered and as Jesus my Savior as being the captain all right just bear with me I'm trying to hear the kingsman singing at my head behind me I will stand excuse me Lord help me I was standing on the banks of the river looking out over life's troubled sea when I saw an old shoe that was saved is that the old ship of Zion I I see it all was beat and bad better from the storms of life I could see the waves were rough but that old ship was steady is that The Old Ship of Zion I see at the stern of the ship was the captain I could hear as he called out my name get on board It's The Old Ship of I am it will never pass this way oh again as I step on board I'll

power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy foreign good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Matthew 19. and remember the announcements remember Wade will be leaving Lord willing Friday through The Minister's meeting can you learn New Jersey remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday brother Jonathan Jones will be preaching like the Saturday night Sunday morning services and we thank God for being with sister Mary there and her test turned out okay because we believe it and we thank the Lord for all of those things the singing was real good the microphone is picking up good out here on it putting it on to that you know the internet system to where you can can hear your singing in that way then that it works out real good and we appreciate all of those things they've done for that I'm just sitting there listening to you because it's always been kind of you can hear just a little bit but not now you can hear the whole thing and the music and everything and we really really appreciate the brothers doing all of that work amen Matthew 19 any other announcements I generally forget I didn't even miss it somewhere but anyhow do you have any father we thank you Lord that you are God and that you change not we thank you as we were trying to express this morning that you will keep your word Lord if we could just be as honest in ourselves and try to keep our word then we don't have to worry because you promised it and then promising it then you made a vow unto us Lord may we see that this afternoon that you may devour we accepted deviled and everything will be made right it'll be a wonderful hour to live and to understand and see that he that the sun is set free is free indeed so you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free we love you father and we thank you just have your way now as we read your word in Jesus name Matthew 19. the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh or for there are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why did Moses then command a giving writing a divorcement and to put her away he saith unto thee them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffering you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another commit us adultery and whoso will Merit her which is put away does commit adultery you may be seated to Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I want to just kind of read you a little bit because get a point and then just oh okay they said the lapel is not picking up I know it's on so I don't know and we'll try to hold on okay I get to walking around so get back get back get back all right but just think about it now let's review a little bit up to a place and then we will read the things the prophet had to say of the subject of marriage and divorce and you know what it is but to understand and make sure see if somebody picks up one of these tapes sometimes it's hard to express things but if they just pick up one message then I try to put enough on to make them interested enough to listen to other messages or announce that other messages were preached and that way they can go back and and do all right now we found that God in the beginning made man made the animals male and female you know out of the dirt but then he made man and when he made man then he didn't make the woman out of the dirt he made the woman from the man all right and in doing that it made her to be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and made her to be him reproduced into another form because that would what else would you say and see then the people of the message will call her then a byproduct trying to make it a wrong thing we've been through those things over and over to try to get us an understanding see we are the byproduct of our mother and father and we are the byproduct of the sexual form that was brought into being in the garden and you know so then we need to get away from being too much down on something and get down to the truth and try to stay with it uh what if it just stayed with one male and one female well we know that God could have not had displayed his attributes of healer savior Etc all right so he didn't make us fall but he made us knowing we would amen he knew from the foundation of the world he wouldn't have stood a lamb as a slain before the foundation world if it hadn't been you know he wouldn't have said it that way so he knew what we would do but he couldn't make us do that I emphasized that over and over because he can't make us wrong and judge us for being wrong all right so he made us then with a choice in that choice then eve took the wrong choice and then when she did Adam took the wrong choice and went with Eve and that way then it brought the whole thing into being but it was Satan's lie that he got into the way he penetrated the mind of Eve you know and got into her mind her thinking and he got her polluted in that form enough to accept the Beast and you know that's you say well that's just horrible to think of that doing but yet he was telling her you know that that's what she was made for that you know he was trying to put it into a word in the basis of doing but yet just enough to make it perverted twist it all right now then it made everything be brought into a condition to her that everybody needed a savior everybody needed a a Grace you know and then we would see we will in the last days uh the the real Grace all right but being born by sex instead of the original creation then we are a byproduct of that and we have no rights to look down on no one else or what we think or what to doing we just looked right straight to God because it doesn't do any good I've never learned that it saved anybody by me down in somebody else right you know are looking to see well now I'm not as bad as I thought it was you know it's other people worse you know where does that help guilty of the leaves is that what the Bible said guilty of the whole all right no no doing see you know you can say well I'm not guilty well all right thank God like we were saying this morning there are some who who keep themselves men or women that kept themselves from marrying Kevin doing well all right that's honorable that's great there were women who kept themselves and men who kept themselves as in their virginity and that's wonderful we praise God we give honor to that but the biggest portion didn't and then that way what are you going to do for them you know can we come pull some rabbit hat out of it you know rabbit trick with something out of a hat and turn everything back and we do as the Catholics who who take a moment that's had you know been intercourse with a man and that she gets ready to get married and they just take her down and sprinkle a little salt on her turn it around send her back the other way and speak The Virginity into the woman well I'm just not that dumb yet I just I don't understand those things and you know and I don't believe it but uh still that's the point now then when Eve done what she'd done remember her name was not Eve she never got the name Eve until she done the wrong then she was given the word or the name Eve which means mother of all living the Inn that's made her then the mother of Cain and Abel you know and but to me then when they were brought forth into this domain both of them was perverted Cain was no more perverted than Abel Abel needed a savior a re he offered a sacrifice he done so proving what was there but then it brought into see that went pretty good A little bit maybe but then it brought into being the point of polygamy among men and you know polygamy among the animal race and as I said then it evidently had to be a spirit because why would the animal race fall into polygamy you know it had to be a spirit that come down to anoint just as satency came down to Eve and and through his septility he was able to deceive her and get her to go on into the furtherments of the things and and you know the problems all right but now here's one thing I want to to put in here then come back to it later all right so I'm going to basically read my notes down through here because it's the way I wanted to say it then we'll read what the prophet had to say Moses never gave a writing of divorcement to those who had many wives he didn't have to it was legal it became a legal way of doing it maybe not a right in the original but it became a legal way of doing it right so Moses when he gave the grace of marriage and divorce he wouldn't give him the grace to just because if you had more than one wife that's not even in the picture and see we should get it down in our minds to see the truth of what it is we're not practicing polygamy maybe you know today in the different thing but what was the problem was Eve having too many husbands that's not the word polygamy remember I gave the definitions of those words where it would come up to there you can understand but see Moses never gave the writer a divorcement to them just because they had many wives but he had to give the divorcement part to those who were caught in the wrong thing and remember even one we gave this morning where the Prophet said in the Old Testament that if you promised a girl to marry her and then you went off and married somebody else before marrying her see you were living in adultery and put out of the camp that was how serious it was back there this is not a play pretty thing that's just just for anything you know see that's what the Pharisees had come down to doing it and then see the people of this message that's the way they do you know well you know who are you to be telling us I'm not telling you don't have nothing to do with it if I say what the prophet said the Bible says it's not me telling you well that's just your opinion well if I tell you the Bible says it you know and the prophet says it then that's not my opinion we're gonna get down to something in a minute it might be interesting on that point but see they had adulterous acts back there that had to be cleansed you know it was not right under polygamy to just go out and live with just any woman you hadn't just like David with Bathsheba what about having 700 wives huh I think he had 700 and Solomon had a thousand well what about 700 wives and yet he wanted Bathsheba now if that don't show what adulteress acts are you know I mean that's a that's the point but around said it was that lust that was burning to our arm and he he says he was taking her bath on top of the house she shouldn't have been doing it you know because she knew what's going on too all right so it was just all the whole thing but David could have wished to it because he had many more it could went with that was taken by us at the same time you know you understand all right but Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning and the prophet said it won't be so when we get over there all right we get over there it's not going to be David with a thousand you know Solomon with a thousand lives Paul said in that you're not in marriage or given in marriages and things because you see the the uh the glands will be gone the situations will be corrected that brought about all of the problems and things and and it won't be me standing there with my wife that she is my wife and this we will be there together but not in that form because to prove it right around him when he saw hope beyond the curtain of time you know she walked by right by him and said precious brother she didn't grab him as husband and say I said precious brother because when we get there all this is going to be gone there ain't going to be no situation now it was not male and many females that caused the fall it was not that see it was not Adam with two wives but it was Eve with two husbands his wife came up to be adultery now if you'll read the invisible Union you'll see exactly where we're going it's not how many wives we've had it's how many husbands we've had is the main thing yeah you say well now brother you're a man yeah yeah and we've had many husbands called organized religion the prophet what did he say he said we are in this situation of marriage and divorce because of misinterpreted theology people didn't tell us well we don't know it then we're not responsible then you are because you heard it yeah all right now and Jesus we read he didn't say that you could put away your wife for just any calls he made the scriptural answer there in Matthew 19 9 when he said it was only for our fornication we went through that to showing the fornication and adultery is the same word we found out that brother Branham said eve committed adultery all right so then that's no problem he we went through all of those things coming down to where we're at all right see then when we went through the thing then we see that the people made it because of what they wanted he said because of the hardness of your heart you know that's what Jesus said to the Pharisees all right it was in other words it was cause they wanted it they wanted a justifiable means is that not the human being that they want we want to justify ourselves and somebody say something you think you're perfect well I didn't say it was we talking about that but all right but see now we found that the man had grounds for marriage and divorce but only to be the scriptural grounds so then the man must have those grounds to be able to divorce his wife and remarry it's not to just he can just do any things he can you know he can do what no right but then we found that there is no divorce whatsoever for the woman because that would break your scriptures and things brother Ryan said he can put us away anytime he wants to but said how dire us try to put him away amen he said it won't work all right there's no grounds whatsoever for her you say well what is look look at the problem brother Dale I didn't make the problem they I'm just trying to help us with the problem all right now I hope you understand this point that I kept driving hard and hard if you read First Corinthians 7 about verse 30 through 40 somewhere right in there especially 37 you'll see what I've been quoting that that Paul speaks of a man's virginity as well as a woman's virginity all right a man has to have one as well as the woman it's not that we can just go out and be anything we want to we can just have intercourse we can do whatever it don't matter about us now that's not what the prophet said he said he can but she can't he can if he's got grounds if not you're right where the Pharisees was says for any cause see that's the way they have it the man for any cause but they surely wouldn't let the woman have any cause the husband had to be dead right because that was the law that was the point all right not a divorce but had to be dead okay so go read that and see that speaks of the man as well and he's guilty just as much as she's guilty and by doing that then if you go and put your wife away for any other reason you remember that a dog treat fornication you're going to cause her to commit adultery I can show you where the prophet in reference to that scripture said she will marry again she will have a man she will do wrong you know and you caused her I didn't cause her I put her away no you caused her because you're the one that caused her to do it so you're guilty of causing her that should be self-explanatory and if you caused her to do that how would it give you grounds for you to be remarried in the Lord because remember you can only marry in the Lord and all men are commanded to my Virgin and surely every woman is commanded to be a virgin but we didn't keep those rules and regulations because we didn't know right he would never talk to us in church like I said this morning you didn't even mention in the 50s you didn't mention the word sex oh that's a dirty word you know we don't use slanderous words like that you know they did have a good modesty about them and things women used to be women and men used to be men you know but now it's kind of changed around and all right no matter who it is if he we are to marry in the Lord we are not to marry unbelievers all right now we're commanded every man is commanded to marry a virgin he's commanded to marry in the Lord and why wouldn't you want to marry a virgin then command it to marry in the Lord we covered that your Prophet would be glad to find these for you my wife being a virgin if I die she marries again she's still a virgin if she was a virgin to start with she stays a virgin that's no problem with saying well well brother Dale how could How could a man marry a woman that had had babies and and been married if she was a virgin to start with and her husband's dead she's still a virgin why can't we get the scripture straight see if the husband's dead Paul said she's free to marry but in the Lord all right we wasn't concerned with these things a long time ago but it's time to be concerned with them like I said I preached it this way in 19 and about 70 or 71 or two or somewhere in there or three on marriage and divorce and I still believe it I've added a lot to the thoughts of it but never changed the point of what I tried to say then tried to drive a point down into our minds of one thing none of us have a right to look at anybody else I didn't do that I praise God if you didn't do that but are you the only ones that's going to be in heaven all right now we'll cover this more when we get into invisible Union some people believe that when you're born again you know when you get to New Birth the debt does away with your marital situations well if it did wanted brought around preached marriage and divorce why didn't he just come out and say that right you know I mean why didn't you just come out and say Everybody's Free you've got the new birth you're free no then will you you don't have any script yes I do all sin is without the body except fornication fornication is of the body that's scripture all right that's not saying that all sin is this way no sin and all is simply saying if we are have a guilty part about us we're guilty brother random had no bones to pull with nobody about it and he said Billy Paul or no Billy Paul said he was married and he said I would not do his wedding now that was the way he said it and you know but that's the people don't like for you to talk that away I'm not throwing off on Billy Paul I'm thrown off on all of us all of us because we're going to find out when we get into the where right around takes the invisible union he said this is a higher order of marriage and divorce we're going to find out about organized religion and what caused all these problems for us to be the way we are see what causes some preachers telling you it's okay right right and you go out and you take the preacher's word well right now back this morning on what we were saying if you're going to believe your pastor is ahead the headship remember under the vows we were talking about this morning and look what that preacher is going to be into you know someone come to me now I'm supposed to be the head of the church right as the pastor I'm the headship part of the church all right and you come and you ask me is it okay for me to do this without the other and I tell you it's okay then I've become part of your iniquity so now where's the preacher is going to be that are standing on all of this you know all right see the preacher minister is commanded to marry only a virgin all right he can't marry a woman that's been touched by a man but he can marry according to Ezekiel 44 22. he can marry the wit of a priest but she'd better she if she was the Virgin to start with he can't marry that Widow the priest you understand see the stipulations there's ways of being but he must marry the wit of a priest because he's carrying the word and you say well brother Brown never used that scripture he gave the scripture in marriage and divorce Deuteronomy he gave that scripture in marriage and divorce he knew the scripture all right because to show you how people can work about it we had a certain brother that oh he lambasted me for even quoting that scripture to him and at my table you know he was beating me to death with boy you're wrong you're wrong and about three months later he came back over sitting at the same table and he said brother Dale have you ever read this scripture there's a scripture I was trying to get him to read see he found a woman did he want to marry and she wound up being the Widow of a priest so he used to scripture okay I had no problems with him see that the man can put away his wife only for being a fornicator or fornication which we covered then that Mary you know the adultery and fornication is the same word all right then we covered this morning our this past two Services talked about being an engagement if you're espoused and you're married you're married by your vows as we covered this morning when we covered it Wednesday last Sunday evening Joseph and Mary were a spouse but God said fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife it was said of Adam in the garden that that is your wife because if your spouse then you're married you're engaged you're married then how many people were going to face it I don't have no wife boy go down to the courthouse see if I've been married but that many times you've been engaged now there is some other things that I could cover and I choose not to at this time about some things that your Prophet had to say on some things that can cause a lot of other situations all right but see when you're when you vow to one another you're married and if you break that vow you're in trouble with God is that where we were covering this morning but we saw this morning something that will relate to marriage and divorce the grace as we we saw that your father can I know your vow all right if it's a young girl the inner youth you know in the Bible we went through that in the scriptures you can disallow The Vow all right and everything can come to a point see if our father if our father which is almighty God right if we approach him correctly honestly and sincerely than our old weddings can be annulled but there's a way we've got to do it all right now I know this is not going to be fun to a lot of people the next few minutes but I must say it as I said our father must be the one that just annoys the vows and the things that we went wrong and that's how close it is to the new birth you know in the new birth he disannodes your vows that you were bound to the devil you were married to him the prophet said kin folks to the devil in the New Birth major Soul pure now here's the basis because we're going to go through some things the prophet said if I'm sorry let's hold on if we're not born again there's no even talking about marriage and divorce right because you got to get the soul right before you can talk about the body right is that if the soul is not right don't worry about it that's why you can't take this imagine divorce Grace and the things to the world and people say well if you need to come over we can straighten out your marital problems how we can mess them up and make you a twofold child of hell all right but if we don't have the new birth qualifications then there's no need of talking about Grace of marriage and divorce so the prophet said it right he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing in your life because you cannot start the thoughts of believing of prophet without first being born again hey come on I'm one standing here looking at you two years I studied this message I didn't come into this message like everybody else I was a Baptist Deacon I was everything in the book in the Baptist Church 23 years old ordained a deacon stood there with him talked to older people I was teaching adult classes when I left the deacons and their Elders are wising thing and a deacon in the Baptist Church is an honored position because they actually run the church and unlike what one brother said one time and he said I don't have no deacons because I don't want to but that responsibility on any other men well I didn't have them for a long time but we have some because we're correct but I'm just saying a point if we're not born again we are believing unto salvation you agree and for two years after coming in this message I sought to baptism of the Holy Ghost reading six books a day and listened to tapes because riding the door won't back and didn't have a lot to do on the job was a firm believer in everything the prophet said but you know what that was just words until I received the new birth he's out born and raised in this message are you born again have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed is that what Paul said see we're trying to figure out marriage and divorce we're not even born again we see everybody like I was saying everybody comes in the message you say well well I had to have the Holy Ghost that led me into the message or what led me when I'm standing here telling you two years and I sought God but then I did receive the new birth was any different brother Dale not in the letter of the word because I had a pretty well a good foundation but see then when that new birth came that word began to come alive a brain here remembers whatsoever I've said and teach you things to come is that the scripture well see I didn't claim that it's because I believe the message that meant I was born again I never made that claim I waited until God gave me something that I knew was the New Birth that could never be questioned by anything and that's why I preached the way I do I preach not a challenge to anybody but I preach openly of what I believe and I stated the way I believe it because I've known that word why try to get off of it now but you understand the first qualification is you must be born again until you get born again well brother Dale I don't know whether I am or not well then you need to seek God yeah but I believe the message I believe this so does the devil well how do you know you're born again God will tell you we see what we want we want brother Branham to come back and tell us we want somebody to tell us we went to the altar pray and I've told you about it and this brother it was like three of us his brother said every one of you received the Holy Ghost tonight well I knew I did and I didn't take it because he's worked but he was a good brother but the other two took it they're saying he said we were born again both of them strong now but I still stayed with the word right now let's get some serious matters of thinking and if I'm a little into this evening forgive me not I want to get it off the heart of this and then we'll do the best we can now talking about disgrace of marriage and divorce we'll read in a minute where brother Brown said that Moses gave a Grace and God counted at righteousness all right let's start off mcdark was the grace to when Moses was there was it to just anybody you know did Moses go out okay world no it was only for the children of Israel he didn't give a writing a divorcement for just anybody all right in the days of the Apostle Paul and the prophet of God said he gave a Grace and God counted at righteousness did Paul give it to everybody no it wasn't to everybody in the days of Moses do you think that Janice and jambres had any hopes on marriage and divorce you remember the two that withstood Moses now if I get the names wrong you put them in the right place and forgive me for being ignorant okay well you think Janice and jamborees that withstood Moses do you think they but you know what they walked with Moses day in and day out if you said something to him Moses said they look like good Believers didn't you but one day they said Moses you take too much on yourself they never argued with him about his Doctrine right they were trying to start a trinity they just said you take too much on yourself we're spiritual also right well do you think they really believed Moses and you think the grace of marriage and divorce done them any good now do you think and I believe they're correct what it filters and how many US that we're stood Paul do you think those two were covered under the grace of marriage and divorce in the days of Paul when they withstood Paul teaching that one of them there's someone that I was even teaching the resurrection had already passed that's right he said what are you getting at brother Dale we'll read in a minute where the prophet of God said this is to my followers only the ones who believe this message marriage and divorce Grace is not to the world it is not to a denominational system now you say yeah but you're just too hard when it comes down to some things what do you think about the people in this message now that are saying brother Brown was wrong here in wrong dark but you ask them about marriage and divorce and they'll tell you that was thus saith the Lord you know why because they needed it right they want to claim it because they needed it but how can you say how can you believe I'm talking to Lula now not the world how can you believe a prophet and believe he was a prophet and believe what it means to be a prophet not a false one now a Bible Prophet that was spoke of in the Bible to come Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 all the scriptures being fulfilled and yet you could say that Prophet was wrong we're not talking about stupidities and things when he would say 700 and 7 thousands or whatever or some word that he said or some daughter deed or something but we want the grace of marriage and divorce don't we in other words we want to believe what we want to believe now I talked to a man one time about this and he was telling me about the he said well we even believe that that the Bible's right to a degree um this wouldn't believer in the message I said in other words what you're saying is what the Bible says that you agree with is a right that's right but what you don't agree with is you know right that's not God's word do we believe this Bible not a King James version about this song do we believe that this Bible is God's word do we believe we'll be judged by this word that we call the Bible do you believe we'll be judged by it and we'll be set free by it right well it's easy to believe they're setting free the judging part we don't like right do you understand what I'm getting at you know the way I appreciate we do not believe that brother Branham was God no but if we're going to believe that he was the one to fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 the scriptures that we quote all the time then we're going to have to believe that what he said is the truth whether we like it or understand it or whatever but do we believe it then can't you see that what I'm saying the other day about Satan through his septility and Paul said that has he done to Eve he deceive your mind through the Simplicity that is in the Gospel of Jesus Christ but brother Dale those are good Brothers Janice and jambridge was probably thought of as good Brothers was probably thought of as good Brothers have you ever really just read the Bible you know the 250 priests that stood Moses and the ground opened them up and swallowed them because he said if you're on God's side come over here if you're not just you know that happened in the Bible well you know what happened the next day go read your Bible the next day the people come to Moses and said you kill the people of God I'm honest I just backed up and said dig another hole we'll find out who's on what side is it honest but you see what about the audacity of man's mind to see God publicly in front of all of them vindicate Moses to be who he was and yet they said you killed the people of God the holy and raise them from the dead Church you think that that won't be done the Bible said it could come a day did they kill you thinking of doing God of service I don't go to service he don't need no help he can take care of his own problems but do we really believe brother Branham was a prophet and what does the prophet mean a prophet means a mouthpiece of God man a prophet means a man on Earth that is used to bring God's word to you and I Janice and jambridge might have wanted to be a little spiritual but they couldn't talk about marriage and divorce right she didn't think about it a prophet now I know you're not going to something like this but go ahead a prophet is your only hope and let's see if you believe the rest of the scripture you remember God wanted to speak to man himself now just as Eve represented us and brought us into a sinful condition right you agree just don't agree too loud because you know I'm going to say something else so now I if our dependence is upon whether or not God sent a prophet a prophet even Balaam prophesied it's in the scripture amen he said I can't say nothing but what God puts in my mouth he didn't prophesy wrong he prophesied the truth but then he went out and deceived the people into going wrong and got him into the wrong things right but what he said is in the Bible because he said a prophet can't say his own words but what about the people today that said brother random oh yes we believe in marriage and divorce now oh yes wonderful Oh Glory I'm free because he said oh man but he was kind of little wrong over here I'm kind of little wrong over there he taught this wrong and he taught that wrong and he should have said not have said if it had been me I would have said all right do we really know what it means to be a for God to send a prophet God wanted to speak to everybody he told Moses bring him out here there was a burning bush for Moses to stand in front of when they got back the whole Mountain was on fire there was a bush for everybody to speak to God but you know what to say it they said Moses you go up and get it and bring it down to us and find out what God wants and we'll do it brother Ryan said that was the biggest mistake they ever made he said that's where they chose law for Grace that's his words and as he represented us and put us into sin the people that was back there that said we don't want to hear from God Moses you go up and get it bring it back down and we'll do it that represented you and I and put us to work under condemnation a prophet is sent but yet this Bible would not be here for us today without the prophets this Bible is the prophets right it's their words are we going to annihilate this one take him out he don't agree with me take this now first thing you know you ain't gonna have no pages left right you see this is the law and the prophets and the law of the Ten Commandments was God in the letter form right what's your Prophet had to say do we really realize what it means to be a prophet you know that run around and said Moses was God the Bible says it you know says you'll be guarded Aaron will be your Prophet all right what about arguing with your prophet you could go into carnalities and say whatever the prophet said I believe it if he was speaking of God there was time to brother Brown and will tell you that some of this is man and so much God when he like to forward and Billy Paul liked the Chevrolet Boy Billy Paul didn't believe his daddy he'd be driving a Ford um he liked to hunt when other people didn't like to hunt see we're not into the natural carnality we're in what the word has to say Amen amen we want to argue that one of the teaching of one God of course now they are in their say any wooden God to the River Jordan you know but you know that same people would be glad to accept the grace of marriage and divorce what about somebody we were talking about life not teaching two Lords out of the Bible that there's only one God and I quoted this scripture you know that the Bible you're talking about two Souls you know we were on last night in the discussion you know the Bible does say that a double-minded man is what he's unstable in all of his ways you go look up the original on that if you like it it's laying in an office the original says the Greek says a two Soul Man what's the original says is unstable in his ways I said that to a brother one time he said don't you scripture like that I do I wouldn't use a scripture like that I was just saying what it said you see you think I'm hard you think I'm a dirty old dude you know I always but I get pretty hard yeah but you try to be nice you don't want to beat people to death you know the brother last night he was saying this and that and the other and I said listen brother I said you're sitting there from one side that you followed down and studied this and I said we're sitting over here that we've done been through where you came from they want to beat him to death tell him he's wrong you'll never reach him that away but do you know what it means that we can say we've had a prophet is there any difference now let me ask you at this point do we believe these prophets were were wrong the mouthpiece of God bring God's word unto us well then if if wrote a random you know was the messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 the scriptures and all just because he wouldn't rotten prophet you know but you know what a lot of those prophets never wrote their message very few of them did you angry most of them were written by somebody else be the Green Man they had a scribe that went with him and wrote would you say well brother Brandon nobody's about 1400 sermons that are live voices that's a whole lot better than to read off of a page yeah and things and some sitting here that were there that seen the dead Rays the sick healed and all kind of things to show that he was a prophet do we put our total dependence upon him being a prophet we said well we'll take this Doctrine we'll take this Doctrine we'll take this but we don't know about that now you know like Feller said one time that that brother random got serpent see from no hermit up in the mountain you know well if he did why does it matter God used it to show him the truth my daddy died in 45. my daddy told my mother what happened in the garden he laughed when she said they ate an apple that was her words my wife was sitting there as a witness mama told her told me why she really tell me why we don't believe that Doctrine y'all believe in that serpent seed stuff you know and all what happened he said she told her said Mayors Dale and you remember what Mr Dale told you Mama never said another word about marriage and divorce because daddy told her what happened he said was he a prophet no no he's a plain old country boy that had some common sense you know because anybody with common sense can read the Bible and see what happened I mean you know all right but listen but we want to accept what we want of the message but what's going to happen one of these days when they ask you there was a man by the name of Martin Luther most of you seen the videos of him the different things they called him in about what he wrote and they asked him to first off recant for what he had said he said he said I can't do that so they kind of weakened down a little bit and they said well did you say this that's in these books he could sit I don't know I never read the book but that one what he said he said I can't take back what I wrote he said because that's what I believe all right now if he could be that strong about his words did not the prophet said you'll be condemned by what I say he said that's why you say what I say right you know he said that the white horse rider was the holy ghost in fact his early Ministry you know you could have went around you could have preached all over the country that the white horse riders the Holy Ghost God wouldn't help you responsible because it was the words of a prophet but when he come out and said it's the Antichrist in that end to Death now you don't go say no more right is our dependence upon whether or not God sent a prophet we all talk about that the prophet's message was sent to bring us to a change of the body right don't you believe that but this message was brought to bring us to a change well it couldn't be done with anybody else's it couldn't be done under Luther Wesley Pentecost of what Baptist anything it couldn't be done under those Doctrine even though they had truth it would have to be somebody with the truth it's kind of odd oh Dylan's brother random when he was alive right he said get your Bible and come up here and stand beside of me oh they wouldn't do that but now they're running about the country Lord showed me he was wrong then the others are saying well now no no I I'm not going to say that he's wrong I'm going to say he should have said it and this is what he taught you know we'll give you the quotes like I said tonight's not talking about the two Soul people they had a favorite quote they quoted wrote around him and saying the soul is just the nature of the spirit there's not a quote for that no more brother said to soul is the nature of his Spirit he didn't say just so they added one word and if you say it's just the nature of the spirits you make it on irrelevant or doesn't have any meaning to it if I tell you there's a bar outside but he's just a buyer there's no hindrance you ain't afraid of him why because I injected the word just into it and made it be something different do you believe that God sent a prophet and that that Prophet that words of that Prophet is what we'll stand on it well I just can't put all of my hopes in that I got to have a little bit over here I remember years ago when you know a lot of them knew what was going to happen to the American systems and a lot of preachers put money in the Swiss bank account because that's the safest place to put your money because it's just kind of you know a common thing of it being safe there well just in case this don't work people swearing screaming and hollering there's a Rapture had to come by 73 and a half or coming by 75 or 77 especially how many of sermons you ever heard on that well we're still here right was he wrong no I proved in 74. that we could pass the year 2026 and never break one of brother branham's messages are the scripture but who wants to know about that they don't want to know I'm not invited to go anywhere preach on that they won't even say how did you come up with that idea why how many people really believe brother Brown's message we've just been through series on Daniel 70 weeks and the life when it come down to there happened to be a bunch of people downstairs here at the church and this certain brother was jumping so hard up and down and screaming get off of these things get on something else do these bouncing the floor and one lady I won't say no more she said I send black folks up there jumping up and down about what's being said it wasn't them black folks it was her daddy see who wants to know the truth as I was saying while ago about Martin Luther what would happen brother dick when they come down to you and I and they hold up a quote book and they say do you believe that you mean you believe everything he said he said no no I don't believe our thing said because he did have words wrong he did say Mary and Martha they said we're not talking about that now we're talking about a Doctrine do you believe every Doctrine he brought you can't say that you believe every Doctrine brother random brought to be the truth then you're making him a false prophet now how can you accept the grace of marriage and divorce if you've got a false prophet you got a false Grace you see why I'm not popular but they won't nobody come and argue about it either he says that make you something no makes me just what I am 40 something years studying a message going into 50 years now and I challenge anybody in this message to show me where he was out of the word or to show me where the Bible is wrong because if it is we are lost enter of all men most miserable no we just like the brother was saying last night I see them I knew him immediately then he had had a lot of contact with with organized religion because his point was I think we just need to stay with Jesus in the Simplicity of salvation right right see that's the whole thing what is in this message we don't need to know these deep things we just believe that God sent a prophet well what is ending okay now do you understand what brother Dale stands I'm not into stupidity of thanking everything brother Brown said was right because there was a lot of things he said was incorrect but not incorrect in that he was telling it wrong he would tell a story of this happening and then he'd retell it over here and they'd be things he'd tell here that wasn't over here right we read in just a moment that brother by Adam said in the marriage and divorce that were the imagined divorce Grace was revealed was on a mountain he said the same Mountain marriage that the seals was revealed on you know he's one thousand percent correct but according to him sunset Mountain was where the Angels Came Down on the seals Lehman Mountain which is in another Direction only 30 40 minutes up the road from home is where marriage and divorce was revealed but there's one little quote that you don't wait long enough for God to speak to you he said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals sunset Mountain was where it was revealed Lehman Mountain was where it was told him the grace that could come we'll get that in a minute he said I had the scriptures on marriage in divorce but he'll say it's the same Mountain like sister Barbara's husband he was telling me all the contradictions in the Bible and I said please show them to me he said well here it says in David that he had 40 000 chariots and said here he said he had four thousand in Jerusalem no problem he had 36 000 somewhere else you know I wasn't laughing at him I'm just sensible it said 40 000 in one place none of this says he had four thousand and so he had thirty six thousand somewhere else right one author will say two Blind Men well I'm gonna say one is that a contradiction me you see what it is that we got in our own mind what we want to believe and until God speaks to that mind that individual person any one of us and show the truth we don't know what truth is I don't care how much you said you believe it how many times do you think Martin Luther probably ready to just shall live by faith but one day when he read it it come off the pages he wrote just your living alone while it was revealed to him he wouldn't protest the Catholic church until God spoke to him well everyone said I wouldn't preach on the hell until it was revealed is that his words he said but once it's revealed he said then I challenge anybody come and show me where it's wrong do we really have everything based upon God sent in the prophet we all put too much emphasis up on a man yeah I got it on you he's wrong here who are you show me your credentials bring them to me from the word of God and then stand there and let God back it up but the Bible says if a man come and give you a sign and the sign come to pass and he take you to another God don't believe him what does it mean to be a prophet what does it mean to be a follower follower of this message what if they come to you one of these days and they said you really believe this man what are you going to say the coach going to jail if you do what are you going to say what about those who saved right around was wrong what about people who say the Bible was wrong then it evidently as we just get to decide which one's right and wrong by what you say right so if you tell me the Bible's wrong you're supposed to be able to tell me what's right and you're the one I'm supposed to be following right if you can correct brother Brown if you can correct the Bible I'm supposed to follow you I don't mind talking that away because it shows where I've got my heart set everything is set that this Bible is right it is the word of God a lot of it I don't understand but I believe it from cover to cover and everything's in between that I understand right I believe this prophet's message my whole dependence is upon see my salvation was not is not based I maybe I need to explain something because people the way they misunderstand you my salvation is based upon whether Jesus Christ died or not but you know what I can only read that according to what somebody said right so how do I know that the Bible is not a bunch of fake written by some man or something whatever no man can call Jesus a Christ or whatever it says except what unless it be a born-again experience by the baptism of the Holy Ghost um because if God can't keep his word straight how many times have you heard the prophet say that he said if God can't keep his word straight then we got a problem well I don't believe this because the King James come down from here and this come over here and it's up to it in here and Vatican you know vulgates are different you know why I believe the King James version to be right now listen first off it was one the prophet used and he Vindicated second off it's the one God used to get me to him and that's a greater Vindication than to say that I believe brother Brown to be a prophet was on the mountain right he's up there with Jesus when they've come down you know and Matthew 17 or what it is all right but he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy well because he had a personal experience inside of him people die from personal experiences but him knowledge won't take you to death you will run every time his knowledge will take you away but the Bible's right in one place and wrong the other who decides what's right and wrong all right if the prophet's writing one message wrong the other one who's decide which one's right and which one's wrong if we can't qualify for all of the word how can we qualify for part of it we must be totally dependent upon who has spoken to us right now the life statement I'll make is brother Branham he said and the word of the Lord came to the prophets he didn't say prophet he said Prophets that's the life statement he made in marriage and divorce he's having people to stand and some with our today preached it so are we dependent upon God to keep his word straight remember if he can't keep it straight he can't judge us come on if he's wrong he can't judge me and you for being wrong have I been through all of these things so now let's just start reading a little bit so go ahead brother now if I go a little empty I'm sorry I'll try to read as fast as I can and not make much comments because the rest of this is self-explanatory so we start off on the first quote from the prophet paragraph 277. all of this will be for marriage and divorce so if I don't say it it's our 65 2 21 in the morning now on the marriage and divorce it has to be revealed oh I got a backup excuse me Josh is having to help me on the thing now I'll try to stand over here so keep sending me back now on the marriage and divorce it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it that's does that need anybody do I need to interpret that you know is anything in language that got fouled up somewhere it's self-explanatory unless it's revealed you don't know it I just believe it brother well amen as the Holy Ghost revealed it to you it's in marriage and divorce I don't think I've brought it wrote around and said when you get a revelation that is your wife has it ever been to revealed to you that that is your wife or that is your husband have you ever prayed for revelation of whether it's not and we certainly don't believe in Soul mating to lay one down and go get another one like the people of the message they're interested in find out what Paul brought around would say Paul had another hive you know I ain't worried about we had two hives or three hives I'm withered about I'm worried about whether or not I'm right I'm not worried about his experience but look what he said but he promised in this last days now look where it's placed on I love this because it goes right back to where I was talking about because where does he go to that every hidden Mystery in the Bible would be revealed how many knows that Revelation is the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it that all those hidden mysteries on marriage and divorce and all these other hidden things be revealed in the end time now where were they revealed now you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the sky the seventh Angels standing there come back in the opening of The Seven Seals watch what's taking place brother Brown said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals he said the rapture we thank God for the opening of the seals to bring out this message of the rapture come on you know that he made the Ten Commandments the seals of the Old Testament he said when these Ten Commandments came the seals were broke you know what was broke to Moses on the mountain the seals he said well how do you know that because right around the city got God in a letter form he said they didn't understand he said they wanted the Book of Rules we said they got God in letter form well see we're not supposed to be talking about God in a letter form right so what is the first thing it must be revealed who is it too go ahead with number two paragraph 280 basically from here on be almost constant reading of the same two paragraph 281 and I remember I said this to this to I say this to just my group only and not in the hour I'm saying this to only my own followers this message is only to them and what I'm going to say here he said now you ministers you can do what you want to that's up to you I'm not speaking here in Jeffersonville the only place he would just say and this is to the Jeffersonville people I not the only place I would speak this at is because this is the only place I'd speak this app is because it's my own flock but he wasn't just speaking of that it's to the bride of Christ right it's the because it's not we better all go to Jeff I'm serious a lot of them believe when the brother random went out in West they went out there with him whole church has moved if we believe it's got to be the Jeffersonville we better go to Jeffersonville right no problem it's the flock that the Holy Ghost gave me to understand to be overseer all over and he will hold me responsible for it and these people of mine has been converts here from across the land that I've led to Christ and little children I'm here to help you and I am your friend you might think I speak against you I'm saying this see for your good I love you and if it isn't so God is my judge you know I love you jumped up to paragraph 299 number three I got 299 he says this is to my church only not my church the little flock that believes me and fathers me this is to them the other day knowing that when I tell you anything it must come thus saith the Lord then I had the scriptures listen to that quote then I had the scriptures as he revealed it to me and show you where he goes into conduct order and Doctrine and he goes into another message there and said the Lord spoke to him going down the road and told him he said go lay it Go appreciate that and lay it aside you know on marriage and divorce look what he said he said he had the scriptures as he revealed it to him but Lord God what can I do that congregation I'll have separations now you go into conduct order and Doctrine and you'll find brother Branham saying this in 64. this is 65. see he said go on As You Are things have been made right before what's he speaking from the revelation of the word he knew of the grace of Moses and the grace of Paul he said he had the scriptures on it but you don't play when you come out with what he did it took a personal contact from God to the prophet before he would speak it right well I just do it presumption well yeah exploded for everybody let's go now you're presuming you're venturing without Authority see all right we're on number one finish number three look at number four paragraph 307 through 310. friends and then I'm closing you can go from this that's when this was being revealed to me you're talking about when he was up on the mountain I turned the little boy said brother random I show you right where he is at what am I going to tell you right now so don't miss it now this is what he said being revealed for what he's going to tell him all right name remember well my point was he had the scriptures what about a man standing with the scriptures knowing that God gave the grace in the days of Moses and Paul because he had the scriptures but yet knowing that he would be presuming if he stepped out there himself and said it because there's no written word he could read Moses he could read Paul but there was no written word you better believe right around was a prophet watch it now I'm speaking to our followers only who is following me and this message only not the outside by me record of this before God dusted this Groupon we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology is that right that's why you women married the second time and you men because they misinterpreted theology now I want to show you something that he told me and if God our creator before I read that point dirty you know that brother random said that this marriage and divorce was a question in God's word I'll read that to you in just a minute now where can it be a question in God's word he tells you right there what the question is not read too many he says it's a question in God's word he said God's Prophet was questioned because that's what he said can a man put his wife for anything so when I read it we're found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology is that right that's why you women married the second time you've been because misinterpret technology I want to show you something that he told me and if God our creator was questioned the question when he was here on Earth he says Jesus Christ and when was Jesus questioned by the Pharisees in Matthew 19. three through nine there was not a question in God's word like something wrong with God's word it wasn't correct they questioned the word right follow me if our God our creator would question the question when he was here on Earth Jesus Christ and when he is delivering Prophet came forth Moses down in Egypt to bring the children out of out of Egypt to put them in the promised land and Jesus said here that Moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was Moses found such as let him suffer God permitted Moses that Prophet sent to the people to Grant this writing of divorcement to them now I've done been through that so I don't have to preach no more Moses never gave a writing a divorcement for any time you know everything it was stated in Deuteronomy 24 what it was okay go ahead to the next 3 11. in First Corinthians the seventh chapter and the 12th and 15th verse in the New Testament Prophet Paul who meant the same thing in the church spoke this this is I not the Lord that's in Corinthians 7th chapter that right because of the divorce situation it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and God counted it right recognize it righteousness Paul had a riot when he found his church in that condition you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his father and his message that's brought me this far should not upon the mountain permit me to do the same time to suffer you to go on the Way You Are and do it no more know your wives and live in peace or the hours late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bear me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this and watch you go ahead and run it up a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word not a question what are God's word is right or not they question God there's no question whether God's word is right it's God's word they question God let them go on in as they are and sin no more now let them go on in as they are so he said we can't straighten this out it's ideas and do that and work this out we don't have time let them go on as as they are God went there with three wives what'd he go home with one the world says three that doesn't mean going as they are so we had three going down he took three back home won't be dumb he went there with three come home and one woman went there with three husbands came home with one husband now we'll get into invisible Union uh if God let that do that way then why are we playing around slopping and kissing on the old boy if he's supposed to be dead now remember what we covered this morning only her father could disallow or her husband which would be head right headship can disallow right well you better see what God done he disallowed all of those vows that was made if we can really believe it we don't believe it won't do us no good now not to just keep on doing it oh now that's uh don't play games with God the just be truthful don't try to go back because you can't straighten up things you just go in his yard and forget it he said you know what brother Dale I've done this and done that after marriage now that's between you and the Lord I mean after I heard the message that's between you and the Lord I don't have no Grace to be give to nobody but I will say a lot about it through the message of Grace if we can really believe it you know the Bible says that a woman is in uh flashing red lights if it's coming the Bible says if a woman lives in pleasure she's dead we'll get into invisible Union if you'll read it correctly you'll see that God let your old husband die now if that's a higher order what happened when he went there to marriage and divorce all the records of the world he had three wives right or three husbands but in God's record they went home with one if they believed it if it's revealed so where we're going with it what can you do about it I've had people to tell me what you need to do is command them people to live single the rest of their life you know well if you'll show me where that works it out I'll preach it that way you know you can show me that's where it was I'll preach it that way but you can't do it so why don't we believe in grace not disgrace why don't we believe in grace if you can believe enough for that old denominational husband to die if you can believe enough for that old um devil to die that was in your soul Why Stop Believing because it's left up to you it's not whether or not I say it we have a lot of people come to this church that's had marital problems in their lives I'm never condemned to one of you you think I do from the pulpit talking like I do but I never have don't condemn nobody just try to get you to see God pray to God for Grace because I can't answer the questions brother you think I'm all right won't you stay you said well what do you think about it it's not up to me amen it's up to you right I mean all right let's read another another tune and we'll try to quit now I love this one because of the way he States it this is paragraph 314 of marriage and divorce it wasn't so from the beginning and it's right it wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions as God's servant I won't call myself his Prophet but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying a ground for him when he does come so under modern conditions look I command you to go home with your wife now you'll notice in a moment ago you could argue over what he was saying because he said you're going with your wives plural now he makes it straight lined up he's not saying it's okay said you're if you're happy with her live with her raise your children and well I'm not happy with her we'll go live by yourself maybe you're happy right I doubt it I've seen some people so sad I don't believe that they could be happy if they live by themselves on a desert island everything's wrong like I said you give somebody a million dollars now I gotta go pay the taxes on it you'll never win if you're happy with her live with her raise your children in the admonition of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God go ahead let's continue reading let's see that's 3 14. we got a few more we'll go up to 316. this is continual reading not the same great Jehovah now watch what he that suffered Moses that Moses that serpent servant that would he would tell his people and God you suffered him to give a writing a divorcement all the great apostles who was the writer of the New Testament as Moses was of the old Moses wrote the laws and the dispensation of the laws many of the prophets their words were rejected into it but Moses wrote the laws and you suffered him in writing to write them a writing of divorcement because of the hardness of their heart the great Saint Paul being the writer of the New Testament could also make such an assertion that I speak unto I speak under these conditions I am not the Lord going to the next number eight join us today Lord God at the end of the world as we are here under the mercy of God knowing that soon we are to answer in his presence and as you have did so much Lord I am sure in the sight of these people they'll hang on to this it like it come from you and by record here today of many people sitting here that even saw that sign up in the mountain where the angels of the Lord came in the Whirlwind where he came into seven angels for the revealing of the mystery seven Mysteries was unfolded that same angel in the same direction on the same Mountain the day that this was revealed that's two entirely mountains but he's not saying it's it was revealed on Sunset mountain in the seals right God I pray that the people will go home being thankful that God has granted this grace to them I only spoke at Lord Trooper Mission and only say it through permission Lord and let the people be so grateful that they'll never try to do this sin again and and may they never try to do any sin but love you with all their hearts Lord with their families happy and Lord make these families happy and may they grow and raise their children in the admonition of God I'm gonna grab 320 going that way for my message

and going to live for you granted Lord it's off my shoulders now they're in your hands I pray that you will bless them he's praying over the handkerchief's heart look at the last one number 10. may we go in peace happy rejoicing because the god of creation has showed us since the founder since the beginning and has extended to us in our mess that we're in his grace again in the last days oh great and eternal God how we thank you for it may our hearts be so happy that you will never have another we'll never have another desire to sin against you in Jesus name amen he starts singing I love him and he said I say now so the ministers will understand this is to them that follows this message only are you happy congregation amen have told I have told you the truth thus saith the Lord all the way through amen I understand and raise your hands as we'll sing it again I love him I love him for his grace I love him for his Mercy I love him for his word and the word of the Lord came to the prophets so do we believe what the prophet is saying you said well brother I I've got problems how can I correct them there's never been but one way of correcting any problem number one this is Brother Dale okay we read what he said this is me how do you correct anything number one number one admit you got it that's the first basis all you honey Glory beverages prop everything up you know you can't tell me well ain't nobody gonna try to I know what I believe okay if it's right you're right but where's all you screaming and hollering going to impress anybody it ain't gonna do nobody any good to watch on judgment to scream and holler at God and say look what I've done and I'm going to say this because we're going to end the individual reunion see I've told you what I believe it's brother Dale I believe those that are that are the twinkle of an eye now you understand I didn't say nobody about nobody going into Rapture not even talking about none of it I'm talking about change in the moment of twinkling of an eye when this Mortal shall put on immortality the dead is already raised so we're not talking about it that Bible didn't Christ your eyes first we wish our lives and reminders be changed and I believe those that come to that change is going to be standing there free from all things because they believe God how did you get the new birth well I just happened to be so good he gave it to me he gave it to you because you believed him and you know we don't have to play with God you know why a lot of people don't get the Holy Ghost because they don't believe him sure I said this brother Dale talking okay you know you can't get the Holy Ghost if you don't believe God but you can say oh you want to about believing if it's really not down within your heart come on Amen you're only in the head knowledge right see and you know that God knows whether or not you really believe that's right so the Bible's right he said well we know that but the Bible said he gave the Holy Ghost to them what that believe well you know why don't give it to a lot of people they don't play if they're screaming hot hollering they all when somebody how much they believe you know for certain they don't believe a whole lot when I'm in this Pulpit I preach hard and straight but you've been with me I don't go out there and try to make everybody believe what I believe I don't try to make my family believe what I believe I don't want to make my wife believe what I believe I want her to have her own experience with God see that way you're not built on a man you built on God's word I want to see people saved not just stay head saved you know to where you think you're saved but those who walk off of this Earth in the change part are not going to be all messed up I don't believe when we go out here we're going to have limbs missing to you you know I mean you come up to the change you got an arm missing you got to go to heaven to get the arm I don't think so and I don't think that we're going to go out of here messed up in our doctrines and believing and I'll just be honest I don't mind saying it we're not going to believe false doctrines and be changed among the twinkle of an eye I didn't say we wouldn't go to heaven I've never said that about nobody I stood here 40 years ago it's on tape I don't have to back up maybe 30 35 might not be 40 if it's close to 40. and I said there's going to be a lot of people that believe this message is going to die and go by the grave before the change comes because it won't be able to make it to the change and I said I may be one of them and if I die today just write it down and say well it just wasn't one of us it's going to make it to the change but he sure did scream and holler enough trying to get us to it you know we will give him honor for that you see I saw it then and I said it and I believe it a lot of people will never be able to make the change because they can't put everything they got up on this message they can't put everything they got upon whether or not this was God's profit they can't put everything on whether or not this is God's word they just put just enough to be able to hold on you know and just in case now they just don't work I got a little something special over here left over I got my name in gold in a Baptist Church I asked her a while back it was still there the preacher told me yes because he's a friend of ours because they got a tree showing all the deacons that was ever in that church and they got a tree showing all of the preachers were they were in that church it's just kind of funny there's more preachers now are deacons you know but because I was there when the preacher lasted three months got run off by the deacons but still my name is darn gold we went back here a while back the last about a year or so ago and Zach wherever he's at he's buddy of his was preaching his first sermon we went back to the whole family went to the Baptist Church you're this boy preach well I don't think I'm gonna die and go to hell for the Hat but you know what I sat there and looked around and I thought Lord when I left here that women wouldn't cut in their higher they did trim it but not you know bald-headed something and there was no women who would ever come to church wearing a pair of pants or nothing we left there in 1960 eight 67 excuse me the women didn't come to dress like that but when we walked in there they was just everybody was just yeah you know pants and things and all and I thought Lord look where I'd be if I'd stayed here I thank God every day what he's done for me I thank him every day for saving me I'll clap my own games today for saving me you said well brother Dale you was a good guy that's what Paul said he said I'm chiefest of sinners why he lived a perfect life he was falling after God's word and he said he's the chiefest of sinners now what do you mean he meant he was the closest around the truth but yet so far off until he was missing it you said well I have a problem brother Dale I need straightening out about this out of the other how can you straighten out a lot of things how can you straighten them out why don't we believe in grace and pray and cry the rest of our life for God to come down and make it right he's the only one that can ever make it right a lot of things in the Bible you can't explain David had 700 wives God never thought it Worthy to use any of them to bring forth the lineage that would bring Solomon into the world and he took Bathsheba and her husband killed think about it and out of there came Solomon amen the greatest of all the kings had ever been out of there came Jesse and et cetera et cetera coming down to David was aligned back there from who Rahab can you explain them things Moses married an Ethiopian a black woman did God beat him to death about it nope he got on to marry him and her and Aaron both got into trouble because of making fun of it don't tell no stones at anybody in their marital situation I just make it plain what we believe he just what we believe straight and that's plain but what about it folks have we got our whole heart and our whole life and everything based upon this message can I ask you another question why will not people come to someone who has truth seek truth and truth that can even bring Grace into being to not condemn us now you know what I'm saying you've been there you've been condemned you've been beat on for being what you are and never beat on you for being what you are I'm beating on you and me both for staying what we are because we do something about it we got a God that can make a way we got a God that can make right wrong I mean wrong's right and straighten up things but we run around screaming and hollering hunting for something then we'll never find it your brother whippy had a point he said if you want the stuff you got to go or to somebody's got the stuff to be able to get it his point was if you want the truth you got to try to find it somewhere stand with it because that's our only hopes is the truth of God are you trying to bind us to you brother Dale no go see if you want to leave that's good because I'm not against anybody don't want nobody to leave but I'm just honest because if you want to leave then that means me and you are hindering each other right right that means you're a problem to me and I'm a problem to you I want everybody straight and right but this word has to be right not true let's damn Aaron gets the opportunity today to be the one who serves a communion to us he can pick whoever he desires with him because he did the other day and Terrence he he had to pick one day to get somebody to help him and he got Zach people probably wonder you mean a little boy helping served communion with why not what's the problem why not good morning why not if you're born again Christian you gotta have a ride come on brother and I hope you enjoyed the message amen and questions and answers I love them you got a question write it down this is my problem right here what can be done about it and if I can't do know how to say I don't know that's no problem and no problem saying that which is like I said through the series a lot of ministers a lot of preachers are free but they don't know the scriptures to be able to set them free but yet they got a mental Concept in their mind of what freedom is until you want if I can I want to go with this when I go up you know the word of God I want it in front of me because it's what's been in front of me all these 50 years when the old brother came to me and I left the Baptist Church and he came and he said oh Sam's it's all right I know about this man William Branham and I don't say a word about him I said well thank you very much because he was about 80 years old or something he said but you'll be back in about six months well you know what I think about I think about her in the Bible where they said you know he's going and the old Prophet come up to our I'm not gonna say we ain't going in bondage but we'll be back in about a year they didn't make it in a year well I made it back to the church yet you know so I just believe it's true don't you thank God for the truth thank God for the prophets it's one of the prophets that's what he said and the word of the Lord came unto the prophets so we're dependent upon everything these prophets had to say to our lives amen just thank the Lord for Grace amen amen reading from First Corinthians chapter 11 starting with verse 23. as for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and we had given thanks he break it and said takey this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this is this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many are sick for many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasing to the Lord we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest well I said in order when I come I knew I was going to have a hard time with this today y'all just pray for me but I thank God for his grace you know brother Brown he says in this life you'll never be worthy he said he makes you worthy amen you can't make yourself worthy for communion yeah I've heard people say that you know they they don't want to take communion and some Churches don't even take communion they don't even believe in doing foot washing but you know the scripture says if a man examined himself and he won't be chasing you know it won't be condemned with world and be chastened of the Lord but he says if a man examined himself then let him eat meat of that bread and drink of that cup I'm so glad as we heard today there's a Grace God has given us Grace in our lives to bring us to this opportunity that we can partake representing what God has done for us the scripture says that we tarry one for another so just gonna have a moment of Silent prayer and we said you pray for each other I pray for you remember the always come to this time and I always remember that as many sick among us but you know as many been healed taking communion and you know this is a it's a a time to judge ourselves and prepare ourselves because we just want to be what the Lord would have us to be be right with you so let's just all bow our heads for a moment of Silent prayer Lord thank you for this day and all that you've done for us we just pray that you bless the people the remainder of the service in Jesus name amen amen it's time so you took the bread and blessed it father we thank you for this opportunity to take this bread so realizing that it represents your body that's been broken Lord that it was broken for us or that we may receive from you Lord it the the word can only be broken by you Lord that it can be open to us so we can see you Lord that we can become part of you and Lord now we take this little symbol here this Lord to do in remembrance of you Lord that what we want from this time lord we want to draw closer to you as the prophet told us to have communion or to commune with you and Lord not just to talk to you but we want you to talk back to us amen Lord we want to have our eyes and our hearts Open Lord to hear what you have to say to us Lord we just thank you for it thank you for this time in Jesus name amen amen I'm so thankful that we've had someone come they can break the word to us amen I thank God for a passion you know sometimes I think about the opportunity so whether Dale pad sometimes I don't know if y'all remember you know brother Bill told us one time he said you know I could be gone for a solid year preaching around the world and I go the same place people want to hear you don't get to hear this we're blessed people right now going for this one or you said it was it represented your blood Ed Lord you said through your blood we have a mission of sins lordly will be clean and right before you the Lord as we just drink this little bit of wine but we'll do this pray that you feel common touches and Lord just reveal yourself to the sword and Bless the people in Jesus I know it was the blood no it was the blood I know it was the blood for me he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me it was Emmanuel's blood it was Emmanuel's blood it was Emmanuel's blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood foreign Maybe I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood for me amen the owner do we know the song sing the song the token do you know that song I don't know what it's in the book well the Lord spoke to Moses told him what to say to the children of Israel in Goshen that day slay the lamb take the blood strike the post and the door for I'll pass through Egypt this night Smite all the firstborn let the death angel s God's bride safe and love in the token he gave that we could be saved oh Hallelujah Hallelujah to God the blood's been applied his Spirit about sides let the death angel pass now the Sweet Holy Spirit is the token today and those who are under it God said would be saved outside of this token the loss will be found if you want your loved ones safe you better get them in now let the death angel Pines God's brightsafe and life in the token he gave that we could be saved oh Hallelujah and glory to God the blood's been all applied his Spirit abides let the death angel passes amen I'm so glad we have that token the death angel passed amen let's all partake together reading from John chapter 13. it says in supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rides us from suffer supper I laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured poureth water into a basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to wipe wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I watched thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not only my not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed need of not saved to wash his feet but his clean ever with and ye are all clean by not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto him know ye not what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your master and Lord have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant it is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen you know I just want to say one thing I counted a great honor to wash my brother's feet right and I've tried to do something over the years and I ain't finished it yet but I'm still working at it I made a goal years ago I try to I'm trying to wash all the brothers feet and so if I have washed your feet I want that
