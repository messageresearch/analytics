========================================

BL you I sure appreciate the ones that are in the back today it might just be I just I just poked my head in there a minute ago and it was just Abby so I don't know if that's still the same but we sure appreciate you holding down the four and uh so let's just bow our heads in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word today Lord and we know that your will is found in your word your word is your will and Lord we just ask your will for us today Lord God I know that every everyone sitting here today that gathered together Lord our desire is to be walking in the perfect will of God we just ask Lord that your blessing upon the people today Lord give us what we have need of we pray in your name so we've been kind of meditating on uh remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and kind of went through some quotes where brother randam was explaining how it's not the rule of man but it's is the rule it's the actual the word that's that uh is is being preached that is is what's ruling us and I I just wanted to kind of really meditate on the what's being preached as as truth and kind of compare that with a little scripture there in second Timothy where Paul is explaining to Timothy he's um 2 Timothy 3 is is a uh first and second Timothy both have some some really good advice for preachers and uh in 2 Timothy 3 he's telling Timothy this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemer disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinence Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now then he says this this quote this scripture this very interesting to me he says for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with the sins LED away with diverse lust now look look listen to this ever learning now we got a picture of of of a man sitting there amongst a bunch bunch of books he just got a stack of books and he's just learning and learning and learning reading and reading and reading now think about what a jposition that is that you could be ever learning and never able to come to the knowled knowled of the truth now maybe uh Wednesday night I kind of touched on this a little bit maybe poorly explained what my point was but my point is that there's a lot of things that you can learn there's a there's a lot of things you can go back in the Old Testament learn about all the different parts of a Candlestick and learn about all sorts of thing and uh that was maybe my testimony too when I when I first become a Christian you go into the bookstore and you get all these books and you you check them out and you you know you'd read and you read and you read and but one day you get into the message you you get under the message of your day and that's when truth really begins to open up and you get in this this channel something begins to open up and where you actually see Christ you see the Revelation for your day am now see what a what a strange thing that is that there's there's people all around the Christian world that are learning and learning and learning and heaping up to themselves all this information but that's not what Christianity is about just learning things just heaping up knowledge and facts facts facts upon facts but what we come we come to church to have an experience with Christ because Christ is truth and despite all the things that we can maybe learn and learn it the the objective is to know truth now that truth is what's got to be conveyed from behind the pulpit truth is is what will have a rule over you if truth will grab a hold of your life and and I there's this there's this uh saying that has been repeated down from the theologians and ministers down Through the Ages that truth truth without love you got to mix it with love truth without love can be brutal man love without truth it can be hypocrisy love without truth you you just end up loving everything truth without love can be real hard so you got to mix those things together then you got something that you can hang on so think about this ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and and God keeps his word brother Ram said from such turn away for this is the sort that goes from house to house with their little books and campaigns and so forth and leads silly women Laden with sin LED away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the truth what kind are they Janice and jambers have all kinds of Fantastics and everything as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so will these resist the truth men of reprobate mind concerning the word trying to take the word of God and pervert it into something else into a fantastic or religious organization or build them up a great name or make themselves some great name from such turn away stay with the word and you'll find if you really if you really pay attention to the things that brother random is bringing out there's down Through the Ages there was you know those that you you could hear John Wesley's message and and and as in the season and the time that it was delivered that was how you'd come to Christ but now in this day you got to come to the message there was a time when the when the seals were opened up and the Word was made plain that's it it all that denominational time ended and it now you come if you want to hear it you got to come to where the word is right you won't uh a real Born Again experience you got to come to the where the word is and the word can only be found in the season in the age that is delivered under a prophet's message now there's the essence of the of the thing and the message pardon he said I having a form of godliness they go to church they join Church they try to make a long showing that they are going to church and things and go out and live different there's no file fire in their soul there's nothing they're not interested in anybody else talking about somebody that's just ever learning but not coming to the knowledge of the truth everybody else can die and go if they want to now think about what he's saying he's saying real Christianity is not just to know a lot of things but to actually be concerned about your brother and sister actually be concerned about seeing Souls saved actually be concerned about whether somebody's well somebody's right somebody's going to go to hell or not we feel that we're saved let the rest of them go that isn't real Christianity so what's real Christianity truth the knowledge of the truth now Martin Luther said Peace if possible but Truth at any rate Dwight Moody said God never made a promise that was too good to be true when God said it ain't too good to be true it's true and Thomas Fuller said if I speak what is is false I must answer for it if truth think what a awesome quote if I speak what is false I got to answer for it but if truth it will answer for me truth is what it's all about truth now come on y'all I W been speaking 10 minutes y'all y'all can open up your eyes goodness gracious come on y'all we we need to stand up for a minute y'all can do it now we're not even into the service yet it's only 10 minutes I hadn't even speaking 10 minutes trying to do and trying to do God a service that uh without being as the will of God what I was preaching on Wednesday night brother Ram said this was Moses speaking to Israel after he had been Vindicated by God by a pillar of fire and knowed he was proven to be God's servant to lead them out and before they went into the land before they entered Moses said now the words that I have spoken to you I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you if you add one thing to it or take one word from it you'll not stay in the land where the Lord God gives you now now this is where brother brand is explaining that scripture that I asked everybody to read on Wednesday night Deuteronomy 4 and uh somebody asked me about this he preached this sermon twice the last time he preached it he just told the congregation to read that when they go home but in Jeffersonville when he preached it in this sermon he he he reads it in front of everybody and then he explains it what he's saying is you better stay with my word cuz you ain't going to stay in this land I'm talking about that Capstone you ain't going to get get in this land if you don't stay with what I'm saying you won't the you want the promises of God you must stay within the season and the time and the the one that God has chosen you better line up right with his word or you ain't going to the promised land amen he said so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas in it you just say what is said on those tapes you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it now I'm still talking about preaching I'm still talking about that what's ruling over us is the word of God so you got to we can't add our own ideas our own thoughts and and and just to kind of nail that home I there's a there's a really interesting story that I I just happened to be reading the other day speaking of Truth speaking of conveying truth about brother Neville and it's then that sermon trying to do God a service without being the will without being his will he said many times a man God can deal with them give them a gift and the people will squeeze in on those people so he's tell he's going to start talking about brother Neville who had a gift in his life if they're not perfectly called and sin of God he'll cause that man or woman to say something that isn't his will why because the people constrains them to do it now that's where you can see something gets moving in the people and they start pull pulling the or pressuring the preacher to do say something that he shouldn't be saying like and this is what they did to brother Neville see the TRU truth is what I'm talking about this morning how he said how I had to catch our own little pasture here on it out here in the woods one morning about 3:00 in the morning said go tell brother Neville I come to you didn't I brother Neville he said everybody brother Neville prophesy over me this is what the people were constraining him in other words they were trying to get him off of just just instead of just saying the truth what God if God revealed something to him he'd say that but they' be to push and say just just tell just tell me this or that he don't quite explain that that's what brother Dev Neville did but I think we can kind of read between the lines brother Neville got in trouble with the prophet now that's where we need a prophet comes in handy because a prophet is going to be about truth a prophet could tell you well when you told this story or this dream you left out this part of it and a prophet that's where you know some sometimes you'll say what boy wouldn't it be nice if we had a prophet to tell us all the different things in the church you know what I think would be good to have a prophet to tell me my problems that's what I would want to Prophet I'd want to sit down with a prophet and say if there like David did F if there's is there anything wrong with my motives and objectives because a prophet is about truth a prophet I I I I knew this uh this brother when we were in South Carolina that had had seven interviews with brother brandham and he said that this is what a prophet can do he he go in there and a prophet would tell him let your wife handle the finances this is why you got this kind of problem and oh lay out all those kind of things in his life and just lay everything bear but look what uh I'm getting off my my topic look look what the problem is with brother Neville he said everybody brother Neville prophec over me tell tell me this or that see you would have him saying things then that wouldn't come to pass it's all about truth right truth now see you you start looking at uh that uh nickan spirit moving up into bmismart is run or whatever and that could be that could be that something that ain't ain't right and that's why a minister behind the pulpit their objective what they're selling they merchandise is truth truth mixed with love right and brother Ram said in the Ephesian Church age I believe in leadership but it is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sins to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one and there they are in Ephesians 4:11 some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers and you could lump these all under the category of Shepherds and what a Shepherd is is they're really the lowest thing on the ladder a Shepherd is uh and we were talking last time this is this will be a good Christmas message a good little holiday message because why it had to be Shepherds Shepherds were the first ones to to be to be pointed to where Jesus was laying in the manger cuz why you going to have to come to a Shepherd you're going to have to hear it from a Shepherd to know where the word is and shepherds are really lowly people it's a just in the natural a a natural Shepherd is a semiskilled profession at best they didn't have nobody training some any training training given to them they just somebody just told them go watch the Sheep now in in the uh in the spiritual they better be a little bit skilled you you can't just come up and well I I don't know nothing about nothing you need to be a little bit skilled you need to be able to have well we'll look at that in a second and and you can they're so lowly that you can actually in some places like New Zealand or where they you can replace a shepherd with just a little dog have a dog running around watching the sheep and that's how low a Shepherd is and that's why Luke in Luke chapter 22 Jesus said let him who is greatest among you become as the youngest and the leader as the serpent servant leader as the servant in second Timothy 2 second see Paul there's a lot of good stuff for preachers and what Paul told Timothy in second Timothy 2 Paul uses and you can go read that I'm not going to Bel this point but he uses seven different ways to describe a minister with describing sacrifice and labor and service and hardship now he calls a minister a teacher he calls him a soldier an athlete a farmer a Workman a vessel and a slave and all of those things are metaphors for somebody that's working hard that's sacrificing themselves for somebody else that's in service that's in a in a duty that is not easy and that's why nobody that is dominated by their own self is fit for this task that's why Matthew 2025 Jesus said Jesus called unto them and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and that are they that are great Authority upon them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them why CU that's how the Gentiles ruling with a an idea that they they should be uh lifted up above everybody else in 2 Timothy 2 Paul's description does not make Ministry glamorous so that means leadership in the church is not a Manel of status to be confirmed on the church's aristocracy in other words who whoever's the big shot gets to be a minister it's not given by seniority in other words whoever's oldest gets to be a minister it's not purchased with money whoever's got the most money gets to be a minister it's not inherited through Family Ties that that would be great if I could just make my son a minister or something like that that that would be wonderful but that's not how you're called to be a minister it's not awarded to people who are successful in business or Finance who's got the most contribution to the church who have pays the most ties gets to be a minister that's not how it works and it's not dled out on the basis of intelligence or education or human Talent cuz if that were true then none of the Apostles would have been called there men who couldn't even read or write their own name or or all those things but God called them regardless the requirement to be a minister is faultless character and that's what Paul lays out in 1 Timothy 3 or or two two or three one of them spiritual maturity a willingness to serve humbly and a skill in teaching in other words if you can't convey a thought if you can't convey a thought in a way that people can understand it then and and we'll get to that in a moment how do you know if you're called to preach brother Bram said if you can do it that's a pretty good evidence that you're called if you can do it so what do Shepherds do they feed lead nurture care Comfort protect and correct now now you think about the role of a Shepherd a sheep without a shepher they they're just not going to be able to offend for themselves where are they going to find where to eat how are you going to find where to eat how are you going to find here comes a wolf the Sheep without a Shepherd what are they going to do a wolf comes in so now there's the principle that churches can survive almost every kind of problem except the failure of the Shepherds that's why you should pray for your ministers righten cuz you can find you can survive just about any kind of problem except the failure of the Shepherds if the Shepherds aren't doing their job then you're not going to be able to eat well if the Shepherds aren't doing their job then you're not going to be protected you're not going to be corrected you're not going to be able to move on because you need the Sheep the Shepherds and so we've been talking about all the different kinds of shepherds and he gave some Apostles you know different phases of your life different seasons of your life a different kind of ministry will will Minister more maybe more effective to you in that particular moment of your life or maybe you're down in the valley and you need some encouragement you know you need you need to be encouraged so here comes an evangelist he'll he'll preach a sermon that just picks you up and preaches a sermon about how God cares about you and boy that's the thing you needed right in that moment of your life or maybe maybe you're in a foreign country and you never heard about the message before and here comes an apostle that can make the just break something complicated down into just like a plant growing in the field and and preach something like that where it it just catch catches your attention and sets things in order or maybe there's a great big problem in your life that that just really needs uh some discernment and a prophet can minister in that need and some pastors and teachers so we're on pastors and pastors brother R said you see in the church there is the pastor and that Pastor is a special person built to where he can put up with the fusses of the people he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down when the somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness see he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things now we we were last time we were talking to isn't it interesting how each of these can uh uh an evangelist if if there was nobody else and we've seen that in a lot of churches they could slip over into the role of a pastor and do the job a teacher maybe could just slip over they're not really a teach a pastor but they could do that job and the same a pastor can teach a pastor if if there's nobody a pastor has that ability to teach but each of these has a that quality that is their default their makeup that God has moved them in where a pastor can put up with the fusses of the people and draw people together where he may not be able to lay out the word in the same way that a teacher can and a teacher wouldn't be able to necessarily deal with the people the same way that a pastor can so they've got these qualities that are in heing in them a pastor comes from the letin for Shepherd pastors guide care for and protect the congregation similar to how a Shepherd tends to sheep Pastor pastors teach pastors can teach pastors counsel they visit the sick and they are the head of the church and that's why brother B said always honor your pastor he's worthy of every bit of Honor you could give him the Bible said that yes sir and don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the corn that's that's don't muzzle the ox means that there's an ox plowing in the field and you don't muzzle put a muzzle over him so he can't reap the benefits of his labor you you there there's even last week I I mentioned last Sunday about how there's this controversy about paying ministers that ministers are just not supposed to get any reward for it and even last week I saw another argument on my Facebook where it broke out and everybody's arguing about how you're just you're not supposed to give any kind of reward to ministers which is contrary to the scripture and I could lay that out there's three or four scriptures where Paul says the Min ministers are worthy of their reward with all that labor and all that sacrifice and all that those things don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the corn right amen what a strange idea that what it is is is hate for ministers that like like that story our brother B getting arrest getting not arrested got pulled over by because the cop he didn't realize how fast he was going and that that cop that pulled him over just as soon as he saw on his on his driver's license that he was a minister you could tell just the hate wed up isn't that it's just strange how people are just n it's the devil it's the devil and people reacting they don't want to hear the truth they don't want somebody that stands for the truth in the message of Moses he said tonight so many people can believe God and this is about having confidence in the ministry he said sure you believe Christ you believe the Holy Ghost and so forth but when a man comes to you and tells something that's hard to believe I don't know whether I can believe you or not friend that's where it's at see there that's the reason God can't that's the reason your pastor sometimes when your pastor comes to you the reason he can't help you you've got to have faith in your pastor you got to believe that he's a man of God sin of God to do these things for him now that works both ways we've got to live a minister has got to live with a faulty character live with a uh preaching the truth not swayed by the congregation and then when when a man is doing that you've got to have confidence in him that he's bringing you the truth confidence to know that he's yielded himself and he's prayed up and studied up and he's not just speaking of himself but he's speaking something to help you then if you have confidence in a man like that you can have confidence in what God is saying then something you watch and something will happen am in Revelation book of symbols brother R said if a boy was at the door and knocked at the door latch tell the ushers I have a telegram here here for Mrs so and so and Mrs Mr so and so he would be a messenger Earthly Angel your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place because the word pastor means Shepherd look it up and find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them what with the word of God now this all ties back to what Paul St saying remember them that have the rule over you they're not ruling over you with with uh an anvil beating you over the head but they're ruling Over You by giving you the word of God feeding you like a shepherd with sheep to tell you go over here there's a little nice little patch of grass watch out for that wolf over there watch out for that false Doctrine and they're leading you with the word where the word has such control over you when you begin to wool and you ain't even trying you're not struggling all you're doing is just eating you're just coming to church and the word grabs a hold of your life and begins to change you now there's a real Shepherd yes sir Jeremiah 3 says I will give you pasture Shepherds Shepherds is the translation of that word according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding they're feeding you with something that will give you give you uh a way to fight back against the devil right in 1 Peter 5:3 feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucer but of ready mind and you got to you got to have a Shepherd because in Matthew 9 when Jesus saw all the multitudes running around they didn't he said uh he he said there there there he said he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd without a leader who what are they going to do if some some false Doctrine comes in what Jesus was concerned about him because they didn't have somebody to keep them in unity to keep them headed in the right direction to keep them going to protect and correct and guide and feed and care for them now look what happens without a Shepherd without a Shepherd the Sheep don't have their basic needs without a Shepherd they don't have there's nobody to care for the weak somebody gets out of line there's nobody to go visit them at their home or in the hospital somebody they don't have a Shepherd there's everybody gets all fearful and have have a bunch of anxiety just the presence of a Shepherd can calm the flock down just because he's there they got somebody there without a Shepherd they just get all spiritually stagnated sheep would be confined to overgrazed areas or poor terrain they're not they're not positioned in the right way they don't have any direction somebody to keep them going in the right direction they're vulnerable to predators and here's the big one without a without a Shepherd the Sheep begin to scatter now in the natural sheep go sheep will start going every which way but in the spiritual what happens without a Shepherd as you begin to scatter in your mind with divisiveness and disunity because you everybody begins to start thinking about different way I I think it should go this way I think it should go that way and you start you begin to get disunity you begin to get divided and that's what happens without a Shepherd right Shepherds bring unity in Acts chapter 20 Paul said take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers de feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this I think this was Paul actually I'm not sure anyway it's right here in Acts 20 for I know this that after my no this is Jesus speaking for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous clo wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them now I'm I'm talking about Unity here in John chapter 10 he said I am the Good Shepherd and and and just skipping down he said another sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd and I'm a few seconds over time so we're going to stop there Shepherds bring Unity amen God bless you Saints [Applause]
