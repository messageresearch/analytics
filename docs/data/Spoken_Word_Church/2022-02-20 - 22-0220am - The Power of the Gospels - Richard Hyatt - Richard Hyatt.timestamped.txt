[0:41] holy
[0:52] holy lord
[1:01] [Music]
[1:02] amen is that your desire this morning to
[1:04] see him
[1:06] amen to lift his name above every other
[1:08] name
[1:09] amen well just welcome you all and uh
[1:13] it feels good to be here and uh welcome
[1:15] from russellville kentucky and we've had
[1:18] brother wade visit us quite a few times
[1:20] and so we're just trying to even the
[1:22] score a little bit
[1:24] and get down here and visit we were
[1:25] supposed to
[1:26] be on vacation this week and uh we we
[1:28] did take a little bit of a vacation so
[1:30] we're kind of ending that and uh just
[1:32] coming and spending a little bit of time
[1:34] with friends
[1:35] amen
[1:36] and it's good to be here and with the
[1:38] bride of jesus christ amen
[1:41] well i won't take a lot of time here
[1:43] getting prepped because i know that the
[1:45] first service is a race
[1:47] and uh
[1:49] so we will uh
[1:51] we'll just jump right into our scripture
[1:52] turn with me to ezekiel chapter one
[1:55] and
[1:56] we've been doing a study at home on
[1:58] the seals and uh this morning i just
[2:01] want to talk about the four beasts or
[2:03] the four gospels and the power of the
[2:05] gospels uh those things were open and
[2:07] brought out and expanded upon in the
[2:09] seals brother bannon mentioned them many
[2:11] times earlier in his message uh but
[2:14] in the seals he really
[2:16] brought out those things and so i just
[2:18] want to spend a little bit of time and
[2:20] being a pastor
[2:22] when i teach these things or speak about
[2:24] them i like to bring them down to shoe
[2:26] leather
[2:28] a lot of times when we talk about the
[2:29] seals and we talk about the mysteries of
[2:31] god it's just this high
[2:33] thing that's way up here and people are
[2:35] struggling to understand it but when you
[2:37] bring it down to your everyday life and
[2:39] you understand the influences
[2:41] that are surrounding you
[2:43] and that are pushing you and prodding
[2:45] you and trying to make you make the
[2:47] wrong decision or guide you towards the
[2:48] right decision it'll help you
[2:52] and so we just want to look at these and
[2:54] and see what god would say to us this
[2:56] morning and i've got about 30 sermons
[2:59] i'm cramming down
[3:01] to get some high points on just a narrow
[3:04] topic so
[3:05] uh
[3:06] you pray for me
[3:09] and i looked and behold the world one
[3:10] came out of the north a great cloud and
[3:12] the firing and folding in itself and a
[3:14] brightness was about it and out of the
[3:16] midst thereof as the color of amber and
[3:18] out of the midst of the fire also out of
[3:20] the midst therefore came the likeness of
[3:22] four living creatures and this was their
[3:24] appearance they had the likeness of a
[3:25] man
[3:26] and everyone had four faces and every
[3:28] one had four wings and the feet were
[3:31] their feet were straight and the sole of
[3:32] their feet was like the soul of a calf's
[3:34] foot and they sparkled like the color of
[3:37] burnished brass and they had the hands
[3:39] of a man under the wings of the on their
[3:42] four sides and they four had their faces
[3:45] and their wings
[3:46] their wings were joined one to another
[3:48] and they turned not when they went and
[3:51] they went everyone straight forward
[3:54] as for the likeness of their faces the
[3:56] they four had the face of a man and the
[3:58] face of a lion and on the right side
[4:00] they had the the four had the face of an
[4:02] ox and on the left side they four had
[4:04] the face of an eagle
[4:06] thus were their faces and their wings
[4:08] were stretched upward two wings of
[4:10] everyone joined one to another and two
[4:12] covered their bodies and they went
[4:14] everyone straight forward whether the
[4:16] spirit was to go they went and they
[4:18] turned not when they went
[4:21] amen
[4:22] lord we just thank you for your goodness
[4:23] and thank you for your mercy we thank
[4:25] you for your word we thank you for a
[4:27] message in this day to guide us in an
[4:28] hour that is so gray it's neither light
[4:31] nor dark but we know that in the evening
[4:33] time there shall be light and the bride
[4:35] has a light to walk by and i pray father
[4:37] that it would shine upon us this day it
[4:39] would shine upon your word you would
[4:41] direct us and guide us and lead us in
[4:43] all things in jesus name amen you can
[4:46] have your seats
[4:48] now if you take your bibles and you turn
[4:49] over revelations chapter 4 we see the
[4:51] picture of the throne and we see this
[4:53] same image that was in ezekiel rendered
[4:56] again and it says after this i looked
[4:58] revelations 4 1
[5:00] looked and behold the door was open in
[5:02] heaven and the first voice which i heard
[5:03] as it were the trumpet talking with me
[5:05] and said come up hither and i will show
[5:07] thee things must be hereafter and that's
[5:09] a good place to be to be drawn up a
[5:11] little higher to see what's coming down
[5:13] the road and immediately i was in the
[5:15] spirit and behold the throne was set in
[5:17] heaven and one sat on the throne and he
[5:19] that sat was to look upon like jasper in
[5:21] a sardine stone and there was a rainbow
[5:23] around the throne and
[5:25] in sight like unto an emerald and round
[5:28] about the throne were four and twenty
[5:29] seats and upon the seats i saw four and
[5:31] twenty elders clothed in white rain men
[5:33] they had on their heads crowns of gold
[5:35] so we're getting a picture of the throne
[5:37] room and out of the throne proceeded
[5:39] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[5:40] and there were seven lamps of fire
[5:42] burning before the throne which are the
[5:44] seven spirits of god and before the
[5:46] throne there was a sea of glass like
[5:47] under crystal and in the midst of the
[5:49] throne round about the throne were four
[5:51] beasts full of eyes before and behind
[5:54] and these are the same four beasts in
[5:55] ezekiel and the first beast would liken
[5:58] to a line the second like unto a beast
[6:00] like a calf and the third the face of a
[6:02] man and the fourth was as a flying eagle
[6:04] the four beasts each of them had six
[6:06] wings about them and they were full of
[6:07] eyes within and they rest not day or
[6:10] night saying holy holy holy
[6:14] lord god almighty
[6:16] which was and is and is to come
[6:18] and we'll start stop right there with
[6:21] the scripture and brother graham says
[6:22] this in the seals
[6:24] talking about we're going to describe
[6:26] these four beasts i know that this is a
[6:28] church that has very good teaching very
[6:30] good foundation so i know that this is
[6:32] nothing new there's nothing new i can
[6:34] preach
[6:35] if you're looking to hear something new
[6:36] i'm sorry i'm going to disappoint you
[6:38] because
[6:38] it's all been covered
[6:41] but peter told the saints he said i'm
[6:43] going to put you in remembrance
[6:45] and that is our job as pastors and
[6:47] evangelists and teachers and prophets
[6:49] and apostles the fivefold ministry is to
[6:52] put you in remembrance of what has been
[6:53] before and and sometimes because we've
[6:56] come from a different walk of life and
[6:58] different experiences we can see the
[7:00] same picture from a slightly different
[7:02] angle and help you get a more uh
[7:06] full view of what god is doing
[7:09] but there's nothing new i can preach i'm
[7:10] sorry to disappoint you
[7:12] if i did it would be my own ideas and
[7:14] you all might as well just pack up and
[7:15] walk out right now
[7:17] so brother branham he says although the
[7:19] the actors in these of these seals begin
[7:22] at the first church age and brother
[7:23] braham is going to describe uh and you
[7:25] know when in chapter 5 of revelation as
[7:27] the seals begin to open each one of
[7:29] these beasts calls out and a rider rides
[7:32] forth and as that that occurs brother
[7:35] bram is going to describe
[7:37] kind of what's taking place there he
[7:40] says although the actors of these seals
[7:42] begin at the first church age now
[7:44] remember so you'll get the background of
[7:45] it thoroughly if we can or as thirdly as
[7:48] possible the actors i'll place it like
[7:50] that because an actor is a man who
[7:52] changes masks
[7:54] see it's the same rider on the on the
[7:56] horse and each of these four beasts
[7:59] it's the same anointing the same person
[8:02] behind each of these four
[8:03] powers now a beast in the bible is a
[8:05] power you all know that right
[8:08] and so we see that these actors they're
[8:10] changing masks and in this act tonight
[8:12] we're going to see if it's satan
[8:13] changing mass and all actors christ
[8:16] acting the part he did when he became
[8:18] from a spirit to man he only put on an
[8:21] actor's garment human flesh and came
[8:23] down on the form of man in order to be a
[8:24] kinsmen redeemer
[8:27] he had to be he had to be one of us
[8:32] melchizedek couldn't do it
[8:33] he didn't come the way we came
[8:36] jesus came the way we came even though
[8:38] they're the same individual
[8:41] we see christ acting the part he did
[8:43] when he came uh all right now you see
[8:45] it's only an actress form the reason
[8:47] they're all in parables the way they are
[8:49] here like beasts and animals and so far
[8:51] so forth is an act and so when we see
[8:53] these beasts it's an act it's a it's a
[8:55] mask it's a disguise
[8:57] and that's important to remember as we
[8:59] go on these actors begin in the first
[9:02] church age because it was christ
[9:03] revealing himself to the seven church
[9:05] ages now you understand it all right
[9:07] christ revealing himself to the seven
[9:09] churches though through these churches
[9:11] there's a great mess up comes along
[9:13] that's why we have to bring you to
[9:14] remembrance
[9:16] a great mess up comes along then at the
[9:18] end of the church age the seventh angel
[9:19] message to pick these lost mysteries and
[9:21] give it to the church see now we'll
[9:23] notice that but not then revealed in
[9:25] their true state
[9:27] now in the bible times the mysteries
[9:28] were there they seen these things happen
[9:30] the way john saw it now he said there is
[9:32] a white horse rider but what the mystery
[9:34] of it is there's a mystery that goes
[9:36] with that rider now what it is they
[9:38] didn't know and it's to be revealed and
[9:40] it's to be revealed after the lamb
[9:42] leaves the father's throne of his
[9:43] intercessory as kinsmen redeemer now if
[9:46] you stop right there that's a terrifying
[9:48] a sentence
[9:51] but we're not going to stop right there
[9:52] we're going to we're going to read more
[9:53] what brother branham had to say but
[9:54] there's a lot of people who think that
[9:56] after the priest the seals were open in
[9:58] these things that
[9:59] that christ is no longer in an
[10:01] intercessory role
[10:03] he's still in an intercessory role
[10:05] i want you to understand that i wouldn't
[10:07] preach if he wasn't in an intercessory
[10:09] role because it would be fruitless and
[10:11] it would be pointless there would be but
[10:13] i know that he's still on the throne
[10:16] i know because i have loved ones that i
[10:18] have not seen come in yet and until i
[10:21] see them come in i know he's still on
[10:23] the throne
[10:24] that's the way i have to believe it and
[10:26] that's the way the spirit and the bride
[10:29] say come as long as the door is open
[10:31] we're we're saying come come to him but
[10:34] when he says here that it is to be
[10:36] revealed brother bram's not uh
[10:38] he's not uh uh going in a different
[10:40] direction but what he's saying is
[10:41] they're revealed to the world
[10:44] the masks are to come off someday
[10:47] there's going to be an antichrist that
[10:48] rises up he's going to be wearing a mask
[10:50] and the world's going to think it's his
[10:52] their savior
[10:53] but at the end the mask will come off
[10:55] and they'll see who he is and the mask
[10:58] will come off christ and the world will
[10:59] see who he is even those who pierced him
[11:03] they'll see who he is so brother branham
[11:05] is talking about when that happens when
[11:07] it when when the man of sin is revealed
[11:09] to the world the masks will be off and
[11:12] christ will no longer be on the
[11:13] intercessory throne
[11:16] when the world sees who jesus is
[11:18] and every knee shall bow and everyone
[11:21] proclaim that he is lord the mask will
[11:23] be off everybody will know who he is
[11:26] but we see that he's he's still there
[11:28] he's still in the mercy seat
[11:30] amen
[11:32] all right so when he refers to this he's
[11:34] not talking about
[11:37] mercy being over amen i know there's
[11:39] some people who who preach that mercy is
[11:41] over i don't know why they bother
[11:44] amen
[11:45] just sit back and wait for the world to
[11:47] burn if that's your deal
[11:48] you're under a jonah anointing
[11:50] not an abraham anointing
[11:53] because when the world was going to burn
[11:54] abraham interceded on behalf of sodom
[11:57] and gomorrah
[11:58] but jonah popped some popcorn and sat
[12:00] underneath the gourd and waiting for it
[12:01] to happen
[12:05] i don't know what song we often sing
[12:07] about jonah you know what jonah and the
[12:08] well we often sing that's the only song
[12:10] we sing about him
[12:14] but jonah was an angry fellow
[12:19] maybe one day we'll preach on that but
[12:23] now
[12:24] so can you bring up that image of israel
[12:28] so
[12:28] when we
[12:29] talk about these four beasts
[12:32] yeah we got up there
[12:34] the four beasts
[12:36] that are arrayed around this throne are
[12:38] representative of the 12 tribes of
[12:39] israel and you can see here this i
[12:41] didn't do this so i can't take claim
[12:43] whether it's good art or bad art i can't
[12:44] i stole it
[12:45] all good preachers do
[12:49] but we see that we have the tabernacle
[12:51] of the wilderness in the middle and we
[12:53] see that we have the tribes arrayed in
[12:55] the north south east and west and the
[12:58] way these tribes are arrayed they each
[12:59] have their own individual tribal banner
[13:02] but then to each direction there is a
[13:04] banner under which they will will uh um
[13:08] uh uh sit and and depending upon which
[13:11] direction
[13:12] that's the the group that will lead the
[13:15] way but i want you to understand that no
[13:17] matter which direction and we see here
[13:19] in ezekiel they go they're never
[13:20] retreating
[13:23] they're never going backwards god never
[13:25] retreats
[13:26] and there was a famous general in in the
[13:28] korean war oliver
[13:30] oliver p smith i think his name was and
[13:33] there was a battle the chosen river and
[13:34] he got surrounded uh
[13:37] by uh the north koreans and he was in
[13:39] the middle of a battle there got
[13:41] completely surrounded and they said are
[13:42] you going to retreat he said we're not
[13:44] going to retreat
[13:46] we're going to advance in a different
[13:48] direction
[13:51] and that is what the army of god that is
[13:53] what the gospels do they never retreat
[13:56] god never retreats he may have you go in
[13:58] the same direction you've gone before
[14:00] because you have to finish a battle you
[14:01] have to finish you have to overcome if
[14:04] you don't overcome the test he's going
[14:06] to take you back around until you
[14:08] conquer the test
[14:09] there's this is not a pass fail the
[14:12] bride of jesus christ is going to pass
[14:14] every test she has to
[14:18] and and wha so long as we're here we're
[14:21] going to be moving it and in each one of
[14:23] these gospels represents a a frame of or
[14:27] or a phase of christ's ministry because
[14:29] brother branham refers to to uh uh
[14:32] when he talks about the the horse rider
[14:35] he talks about the phases
[14:37] of satan's ministry
[14:40] those dark those horse riders that's
[14:43] satan in different phases of his
[14:45] ministry and he begins his ministry in a
[14:47] religious phase as a white horse rider
[14:51] all right for the sake of time you're
[14:52] just going to have to ride with me here
[14:54] because i got a lot of hay on my fork
[14:56] and i don't want to be
[14:57] i don't want to be here till midnight
[14:59] i love you all but not that much
[15:02] and i know you all don't care for me
[15:03] that much
[15:06] so you just have to bear with me but we
[15:08] we
[15:09] we see that satan's always an
[15:11] impersonator
[15:13] and when that white horse rider of
[15:15] revelations chapter five when he rides
[15:18] forth uh and six revelation six i think
[15:20] it is
[15:21] as he rides forth and the beast cries
[15:23] out
[15:24] and he calls out he's revealing what
[15:26] that horse rider is and it's in
[15:29] counterpoi brother braham says whenever
[15:31] the enemy comes in like a flood quoting
[15:33] scripture
[15:35] that that god raises a standard against
[15:38] it
[15:39] and each one of these gospels was in
[15:41] place the ministry of christ to counter
[15:43] the ministry of satan
[15:45] satan only has four plays in his book
[15:49] that's it
[15:50] the opening of the seals was showing us
[15:53] the devil's playbook
[15:57] can you i i i'm not a big football fan
[16:00] but i know last week was the the super
[16:02] bowl i guess that's why you all got
[16:04] these big tvs i don't know
[16:11] but
[16:13] but what an advantage it would be to a
[16:16] team
[16:18] to have the opposing team's playbook
[16:23] to know what they're going to call to
[16:25] know what they're going to do and to
[16:27] have prepared in advance for every trap
[16:31] for every trick for everything that he
[16:34] can bring against you what what an
[16:36] advantage it would be and god in this
[16:39] day
[16:40] came down and through the voice of a man
[16:43] spoke to us the devil's playbook so that
[16:46] we could see every trap every trick
[16:49] everything he had unfolded we're not
[16:51] acting in ignorance anymore we're not
[16:53] guessing and groping in the darkness but
[16:55] there has been light in the evening time
[16:57] that can show us what's down the road
[17:00] and we can look back in history and see
[17:03] the hand of satan working and the hand
[17:05] of god working to counter it
[17:08] all through history
[17:10] we see that first 300 years of church
[17:12] history how
[17:15] that's not the trump is it
[17:18] all right we don't have to finish it
[17:20] right now we can
[17:22] but that first 300 years of church
[17:24] history he comes out impersonating
[17:27] christ that white horse rider looking
[17:29] forward to revelations 19 when christ
[17:32] comes back on a white horse satan's
[17:34] impersonating him trying to take that
[17:36] role trying to take worship to himself
[17:39] and his play is to get between you and
[17:42] god
[17:43] that's his play he wants to to interrupt
[17:46] that flow he wants to
[17:48] he wants to in the stead of god stand
[17:52] there
[17:53] remember his original his original thing
[17:55] was i will be like the most high
[17:58] he wanted to be worshipped as god
[18:02] and that's his play
[18:03] and so he sneaks into the church and for
[18:05] that first 300 years and we're
[18:08] we'll get back to this in a minute
[18:11] that for that first 300 years his riding
[18:13] down through time and he's intertw
[18:15] intertwining himself in the church he's
[18:17] getting involved in the church and
[18:19] brother branham said sayings
[18:23] became traditions
[18:25] which became doctrines
[18:28] and the doctrines of men made the gospel
[18:31] of no effect
[18:33] and that was his play in that first age
[18:36] and so we're going to focus here on a
[18:37] little bit on this first age
[18:39] and and and what was taking place here
[18:41] because you when we look at the
[18:43] progression of
[18:45] and go ahead and keep this up here for
[18:46] now when we look at the the the the
[18:49] trajectory of these four beasts we know
[18:52] that the first beast that cries out
[18:54] is matthew
[18:57] it's the lion
[18:58] the first beast that cries out because
[19:00] each one of these beasts is represented
[19:02] in the ministry of christ
[19:05] and each one of the gospels represents
[19:08] one of these beasts
[19:10] a different aspect of jesus's ministry
[19:13] have you ever wondered
[19:15] why
[19:16] you know in chronicles and kings we have
[19:18] we have kind of two separate views of
[19:20] the same event
[19:22] but for the most part paper was precious
[19:26] you know up until a couple hundred years
[19:28] ago uh not many of us had printing press
[19:31] we didn't have access to pens and
[19:34] now i still love my paper i still love
[19:36] my books
[19:37] but now we got electronics we got all
[19:39] this high-tech stuff
[19:40] you know and i imagine when they went
[19:42] from from leather hides to paper
[19:44] people were like
[19:46] it's just not the same
[19:51] and now that we've gone from paper to
[19:52] electronics there's still some of us
[19:55] it's just not the same
[19:58] but it's not the medium anyway
[20:02] god is not on these pages
[20:06] per se
[20:10] it's not the paper
[20:13] it's the words of life that are within
[20:15] them
[20:16] that were never meant to stay on paper
[20:19] or leather or electronics
[20:23] but to be in the heart of man
[20:25] that's where they were meant to
[20:32] be i've got so much hay on my fork i'm
[20:35] chasing too many rabbits but
[20:41] all right
[20:43] so we see that that each one of these
[20:46] gospels goes out to counter and each one
[20:48] of these
[20:49] gospels has a different view of christ's
[20:52] ministry paper was precious
[20:54] so so to have four books written sure
[20:57] it's the life of christ not trying to
[20:59] discount that at all but there was a
[21:01] purpose behind it there's a reason we
[21:03] don't have the gospel of timothy there's
[21:04] a reason we don't have the gospel of
[21:06] judas
[21:08] or or any of the other apostles or any
[21:11] of the others who came along along the
[21:12] way because there was a judas who wasn't
[21:14] a betrayer as well
[21:17] there's we didn't have a gospel of silas
[21:20] or barnabas
[21:21] we didn't we don't have what we have
[21:23] these four
[21:25] and according to history mark
[21:27] who was the cousin of barnabas wasn't
[21:30] even one of the twelve apostles who
[21:31] wrote the gospel of mark
[21:33] most people think that it was peter's
[21:35] account
[21:36] that mark wrote down
[21:38] that's a little history for you
[21:40] you can check that out if you want to or
[21:41] discard it i don't really care one way
[21:43] or the other i just thought it was
[21:44] interesting
[21:45] but it makes sense when we understand
[21:47] that the gospel of mark is about service
[21:50] and it's about but works and it's about
[21:52] what christ did
[21:54] and that's what peter was all about
[21:57] and why peter didn't mention himself
[21:59] very much
[22:00] or he's not mentioned much in the book
[22:01] of mark
[22:03] but anyway
[22:04] we'll get to to that later so we see
[22:06] that
[22:07] each one of these gospels has a
[22:08] different view it has a different
[22:10] representation of christ's ministry but
[22:12] it's the same christ
[22:14] it's the same god but just as we wear
[22:16] many hats
[22:19] i'm a pastor
[22:21] but i'm also a husband
[22:24] i'm also a father
[22:26] i'm a son
[22:29] i'm the same fella
[22:32] but i treat my wife different than i do
[22:34] my friends
[22:36] in my congregation
[22:38] and my parents
[22:39] and my children
[22:41] it's a different but it's the same guy
[22:43] and we see that christ through through
[22:46] the windows of this we see different
[22:47] aspects of his ministry and it's a
[22:49] fulfillment of all who he is and gives
[22:52] us a clear view of who he is and who you
[22:54] are and how you you fit into
[22:57] christ's grand plan
[23:00] amen so we we look here at the the
[23:05] the these uh uh representations here it
[23:07] says now uh brother graham says now this
[23:10] down here i'm on uh
[23:13] you'll find it
[23:14] just leave this up here while i read it
[23:16] dan was an eagle and this uh dan was an
[23:19] eagle reuben was a man's face e from and
[23:21] ox now you get the picture here that's
[23:23] the way they camped in the bible so this
[23:25] is what we're seeing here dan is the
[23:26] head of three tribes judah is the head
[23:28] of three tribes reuben's the head of
[23:29] three tribes ephraim's the head of three
[23:31] tribes three fours is twelve the twelve
[23:33] tribes of israel see each one with their
[23:34] banner and the banner of judah was under
[23:37] was the lion the band of reuben the man
[23:39] the banner of ephraim and ox and the
[23:40] banner of dan was an eagle now look back
[23:42] here john said one had the face
[23:45] talking to revelations let's read here
[23:47] see if it isn't the same in heaven first
[23:48] beast was like a lion second like a calf
[23:50] third like the face of a man fourth
[23:52] beast like a flying eagle just exactly
[23:55] the tribes of eagle camped guarding the
[23:57] earthly guards of the ark
[24:00] the god the gospel
[24:02] guards the mercy seat
[24:05] amen
[24:07] hallelujah don't you see it here mercy
[24:10] mercy seat nothing could come anywhere
[24:12] around it without crossing those tribes
[24:14] right in the middle there and that ark
[24:16] is the mercy seat you're not getting to
[24:18] god any other way than through the
[24:21] gospels
[24:23] the good news
[24:24] the good news is you don't have to fight
[24:26] your way there christ made a way for you
[24:30] amen there were angels in eden
[24:33] protecting the way to the tree of life
[24:35] that man would not touch it in his
[24:37] sinful condition and live forever the
[24:39] world wants to live forever how why
[24:41] would you want to live forever in this
[24:43] condition
[24:46] she could live to be 300 years old
[24:48] stooped shouldered arthritis all over
[24:50] the place
[24:52] knuckles death would be a mercy
[24:56] and as we go on
[24:57] life gets more and more corrupt
[25:01] and the older and longer that people go
[25:03] they'll either become better or bitter
[25:05] and without christ they'll become bitter
[25:11] amen
[25:13] we've got bill gates and all these guys
[25:15] investing money and trying to figure out
[25:17] a way with cloning and all these things
[25:19] to live forever it's the same spirit
[25:21] that was in babylon trying to
[25:23] escape the judgment of god
[25:26] through
[25:26] technology
[25:28] spirits don't die friends
[25:31] they don't die
[25:32] but god has provided a way to the tree
[25:35] of life that we might live eternally but
[25:37] it's through the gospels and the shed
[25:39] blood of jesus christ that cleanses us
[25:41] from all sin
[25:44] and the effects of sin
[25:47] amen
[25:49] crossing what crossing uh
[25:51] the lion crossing the man the
[25:52] intelligence of man crossing the
[25:54] workhorse is an ox or crossing the eagle
[25:56] in the swiftness of it heaven earth in
[25:59] between all around you see they were the
[26:00] guards and it was the pillar of fire
[26:02] brother nothing touched that mercy seat
[26:04] without approach
[26:05] the only thing that could approach it
[26:07] was through the blood aaron went in
[26:09] there once a year with the blood now you
[26:11] see it watch each head of the three
[26:12] tribes guarding the mercy seat the mercy
[26:14] seat of the old testament now have you
[26:15] got that down everybody
[26:17] there's a brand new one brother listen
[26:19] then we'll go uh that was the guards of
[26:21] the old testament how many has ever read
[26:22] it in the bible you know if that's right
[26:24] the guard's the old testament now we're
[26:25] living in another age
[26:27] glory oh i love this age don't you
[26:31] and that's just not because we have
[26:32] electricity and running water and all
[26:34] that good stuff
[26:37] we've got the fullness
[26:39] of the word revealed
[26:42] brother braham said if he could choose
[26:43] any age to live in
[26:46] i would love to have seen noah build in
[26:48] the boat
[26:50] i'd love to see moses been on the trip
[26:52] with him across the desert and seeing
[26:54] the plagues and seen it would have been
[26:57] miraculous
[26:58] i would have loved to have been there
[27:02] sitting at the dinner table with jesus
[27:06] but
[27:08] this age
[27:09] this time
[27:12] we have an understanding and an ability
[27:14] to look back and see what the devil has
[27:16] done and see what god has done and know
[27:18] we're right at the precipice of eternity
[27:23] not hoping
[27:26] but but seeing
[27:28] our faith in sight
[27:31] i love this age don't you god has a
[27:33] mercy today to be guarded
[27:35] do you believe that
[27:36] where's the mercy seat found in the
[27:38] heart of man
[27:40] the mercy seat is in the heart of man
[27:42] and that's important we talk about the
[27:44] intercessory
[27:45] whether or not he's off off the throne
[27:47] and whether or not he's interceding
[27:49] if the mercy seat is in the heart of man
[27:51] it's not in every man it's in the bride
[27:53] of jesus christ and if it's there in the
[27:55] cry and the bride of jesus christ is
[27:57] still here then there's still mercy to
[28:00] be found
[28:03] amen and i'll preach that to my dying
[28:05] day
[28:07] as long as the bride is here there's
[28:09] mercy to be found
[28:13] and first second you want a
[28:15] scripture for that second thessalonians
[28:17] 2 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth
[28:19] already work only who he who now let us
[28:22] will let until he be taken out of the
[28:24] way and who is the he he'll be taken out
[28:26] of the way
[28:28] the bride of jesus christ
[28:31] i didn't get the quote
[28:33] we talked about it last night brother
[28:34] branham and the quote in the seals where
[28:36] he talks about the scripture he said he
[28:38] says the church
[28:39] comma
[28:41] the bride
[28:42] comma
[28:43] christ
[28:45] that's who the he is that has to be
[28:46] taken out of the way
[28:49] he's clarifying as he goes down
[28:51] it's the church has to be taken up
[28:54] well not the whole church the bride
[28:57] and who is she
[28:58] she is him
[29:01] so there's mercy to be found
[29:03] amen
[29:05] all right so we'll we'll just jump ahead
[29:07] here
[29:08] so when we see that we look at the
[29:10] gospel of matthew so so each direction
[29:14] that that they would go
[29:16] they would be led by one of these tribes
[29:18] and they would they would go in that
[29:19] direction whichever way god would have
[29:21] them to go and each one of these these
[29:24] represents a gospel and we see the
[29:26] progression in the church matthew mark
[29:28] luke john and the early phases of the
[29:30] church in the book of acts
[29:33] we see we see that early church was
[29:35] under a lion anointing
[29:38] now that doesn't mean that there wasn't
[29:40] aspects
[29:41] of the of the eagle anointing there
[29:43] wasn't aspects of the oxidation there
[29:45] wasn't aspects of of the other anointed
[29:48] man anointing
[29:49] but what we see is that was the
[29:51] predominant anointing
[29:53] that led to church
[29:55] there's a progression in the church
[29:58] there's a there there is a a a a lion
[30:01] age and then we progress to an ox age
[30:04] and then to a man age during the
[30:06] reformation and to an eagle age which
[30:09] we're in now
[30:10] amen you believe that
[30:12] and so i
[30:14] to break this down and make it some put
[30:16] some shoe leather on it i'm still good
[30:18] for time all right
[30:20] to put some shoe leather on it if that's
[30:22] the progression of the church that's the
[30:24] progression of you
[30:28] you're a microcosm
[30:30] of the grand plan of god
[30:34] god loves to do his grand things on a
[30:37] small scale
[30:41] his plan of redemption he just picks
[30:42] some farmer out in the middle of nowhere
[30:44] calls him out
[30:45] takes him to himself says i know you're
[30:47] 75 years old but you're going to have a
[30:48] child i'm going to build a nation from
[30:50] you
[30:52] god's grand plan
[30:54] and a little family
[30:57] nobody else knew what was going on
[30:59] he calls
[31:00] in the book of hosea calls hosea and
[31:02] gomer and and through their their their
[31:04] marital struggles
[31:06] their little microcosm of marital
[31:08] struggles and infidelity and all kinds
[31:11] of other things god is playing out for
[31:14] israel what's taking place between him
[31:16] and them
[31:18] so there's always a type
[31:21] being played out to the grand scheme
[31:25] if it happens up here it happens down
[31:26] here
[31:28] that's awaited whatever you bind on
[31:29] earth will be bound in heaven whatever
[31:31] you loose on earth will be loosed in
[31:32] heaven there's a connection there and so
[31:35] we see that the the the the gospel of
[31:37] matthew as it goes forth uh it's full of
[31:40] boldness and there's some quotes here
[31:43] brother brahm talks about it uh he says
[31:45] gospel goes forth as a lion it's stern
[31:47] it's bold it's brave like a lion it's a
[31:50] king like a lion
[31:54] that's the aspect of that that anointing
[31:56] that power of the gospel that goes forth
[31:58] and if you turn with me
[32:00] well if you've got a scofield bible
[32:04] if you read the preface in matthew
[32:07] now i know most of you skip that
[32:10] don't
[32:13] don't
[32:15] there's some good stuff in there
[32:18] but he says this the theme this is what
[32:20] scofield says the scope and purpose of
[32:22] the book are indicated in the first
[32:23] verse matthew is the book of the
[32:25] generations of jesus christ the son of
[32:27] david the son of abraham this connects
[32:30] him at once with two of the most
[32:31] important old testament covenants the
[32:33] davidic covenant of kingship and the
[32:35] abrahamic covenant of promise
[32:38] of jesus christ and that two-fold
[32:40] character then matthew writes following
[32:41] the order indicated in the first verse
[32:43] he writes first of the king the son of
[32:45] david then of the son of abraham
[32:47] obedient unto death according to the
[32:50] isaac type but the prominent character
[32:52] of christ in matthew is that of the
[32:54] covenanted king
[32:56] david's righteous branch matthew records
[32:59] his genealogy his birth in bethlehem the
[33:01] city of david according to micah the
[33:03] ministry of the forerunner according to
[33:05] malachi 3 1 the ministry of the king
[33:07] himself his rejection by israel and his
[33:10] predictions of the second coming in
[33:12] power and great glory only then does
[33:14] matthew turn to the earlier covenant and
[33:17] record the sacrificial death of the son
[33:19] of abraham
[33:20] this determines the purpose and
[33:22] structure of matthew it particularly the
[33:24] gospel of israel it is particularly the
[33:26] gospel for israel as following the death
[33:28] of christ and the and
[33:30] and following the death of christ a
[33:32] gospel for the whole world
[33:34] the phrase the kingdom of heaven is
[33:37] mentioned nowhere else in the bible
[33:40] but it's mentioned 33 times
[33:44] in the book of matthew
[33:46] it's
[33:47] it's announcing the king
[33:50] it's announcing the king
[33:53] this is who he is and he comes in his
[33:55] boldness he comes in that and with
[33:57] courage he comes and it's not to say
[34:00] that in the other gospels he's not
[34:01] mentioned to that a matter of fact in
[34:03] pilate's hall
[34:04] pilate and jesus have a discussion on
[34:06] whether or not he is the king and jesus
[34:09] says for this purpose came i into the
[34:11] world but if my kingdom was of this
[34:13] world then would we fight
[34:16] but it's not of this world
[34:18] the kingdom of god is in the heart of
[34:20] man
[34:21] and he's breaking it forth here in the
[34:23] gospel of matthew breaking it forth and
[34:27] and we look at matthew and and we
[34:30] we look at matthew and mark
[34:34] all right we've got the the ox and the
[34:36] lion we've got the king
[34:38] and we've got the priests we've got the
[34:39] sacrificial animal he hath made us kings
[34:42] and priests
[34:44] even as christ was a king and a priest
[34:48] that was the the nowhere else was there
[34:51] that dichotomy nowhere else was that
[34:54] that paradox
[34:57] melchizedek and christ were the only
[34:59] kings and priests recorded in the bible
[35:01] until we get to revelations 5 when the
[35:03] seals are open and he hath made us kings
[35:07] and priests
[35:09] us
[35:10] now
[35:12] not someday but now
[35:16] can you see
[35:17] i get excited on this stuff
[35:19] i get excited i'll keep yelling to wake
[35:21] you up german chocolate cake
[35:24] is that what it is
[35:28] keep you all awake but we see the the
[35:31] gospel of matthew as it leads we see it
[35:33] in power and demonstration in the book
[35:35] of acts and we see that acting out in
[35:38] that first church age and we as a
[35:40] christian a new christian that's the
[35:42] same anointing you're under you're so
[35:43] bold
[35:45] when you first get saved you want to
[35:47] save the world
[35:49] you don't care what people say you don't
[35:51] care what they think you're so you're so
[35:54] on fire for god you just want to share
[35:56] it with everybody
[35:58] it's part of that lion anointing you're
[36:00] bold
[36:01] you're courageous you'll lay somebody
[36:04] says i got a headache you don't even go
[36:05] look for a tylenol you just smack them
[36:07] in the head and say be well in jesus
[36:10] name
[36:13] do you see something that's just not oh
[36:16] something in the church just not right
[36:18] i'm gonna go we're gonna get with a
[36:19] pastor we're gonna get this straightened
[36:20] out we're gonna get it fixed
[36:24] and you forget brother abraham said the
[36:26] pastor will sit on that sometimes for a
[36:27] long time
[36:29] waiting for the right moment
[36:32] like paul did with that girl who's
[36:34] behind him proclaiming these are men sin
[36:36] of god there's a man son of god brother
[36:38] brahma said he did it until he he had
[36:40] enough of it and the holy spirit said
[36:41] now turn and rebuke it
[36:44] there's a time and a place
[36:46] but that you know
[36:48] those of us who are a little bit farther
[36:50] down the road
[36:51] you got to have some grace for the lions
[36:54] you have to have some grace from for
[36:55] people who are in that stage you don't
[36:57] want to don't quench the spirit friends
[37:00] they're on fire don't do anything to
[37:02] slow them down
[37:03] you look
[37:05] you pray that every once in a while you
[37:06] get a little lying anointing on you
[37:08] god lead me in that way because there's
[37:10] sometimes when you need to face a devil
[37:12] head-on
[37:14] and you need the boldness of a lion to
[37:16] do it
[37:17] when a lion roars in the jungle
[37:19] everybody else shuts up now he's not the
[37:22] smartest
[37:26] monkey can trick him
[37:28] he's not the strongest that elephant can
[37:30] toss him around
[37:33] but he's
[37:34] fearless there's a boldness and strength
[37:38] to him
[37:42] and we see
[37:43] you look in
[37:44] acts chapter 3 and you see this and
[37:47] peter especially
[37:48] you see peter walking out and he's
[37:50] walking into the to the temple one day
[37:53] and he sees a man who's been begging and
[37:55] and the fellow is asking for alms and
[37:57] peter stops and and he says look on us
[38:01] now he doesn't say let's fast
[38:05] doesn't say let's call prayer meeting
[38:06] and get the elders let's get the pastor
[38:08] and the high priest we'll anoint you
[38:09] with oil it says look on us
[38:13] that's boldness
[38:16] silver and gold have i none
[38:19] the man was expecting one thing
[38:22] and god answered his need
[38:25] the need he wasn't even asking for
[38:29] the one he didn't even expect an answer
[38:33] to it wasn't his faith brother wade
[38:35] it wasn't his faith that did it it was
[38:37] the boldness of peter under the
[38:40] inspiration of the holy ghost
[38:43] he said
[38:44] rise up take up your bed and walk
[38:47] and the fellow began dancing he began
[38:49] shouting it raised a ruckus in the
[38:51] church
[38:54] lions don't mind ruckuses in the church
[39:00] look if it's under the inspiration of
[39:02] the holy ghost and it's it's it's not
[39:04] humanity but it's divinity in you
[39:08] oh get excited
[39:12] don't be afraid to dance
[39:14] don't be afraid to sing don't be afraid
[39:16] to shout don't be afraid to praise his
[39:18] name
[39:20] you're under the anointing of a lion
[39:23] be bold
[39:26] that's the gospel
[39:28] and peter in chapter four of acts they
[39:31] get called before the council because of
[39:33] it and peter peter who denied jesus
[39:35] three times just lays into him
[39:38] the same jesus whom you crucified
[39:41] lays into him and the council says
[39:44] in verse 13 it says they took the they
[39:48] noticed the boldness
[39:50] of peter and john
[39:52] it specifically mentions the boldness
[39:56] and recognize
[39:57] that they had been with jesus
[40:01] and they go back they get scourged they
[40:03] get told look
[40:04] whatever
[40:05] however this man got healed whatever
[40:07] happened
[40:08] jesus didn't raise from the dead he
[40:10] didn't heal him so just be quiet about
[40:12] it and don't share the name of jesus and
[40:13] peter just turned and looked at him and
[40:14] said i cannot help
[40:16] but share the name of jesus to speak his
[40:19] name
[40:20] and he went back and they told the
[40:22] saints on what had happened and how
[40:23] they'd been abused by the council and
[40:25] the church all got together and they
[40:27] cried and they boo and they asked god to
[40:29] deliver them and and to help them
[40:31] through such difficult trials
[40:34] no
[40:35] that's not what happened turn with me
[40:36] over to acts chapter
[40:39] 4.
[40:41] there is a boldness
[40:43] that takes place under this anointing
[40:46] under this gospel
[41:01] and being let go verse 23 they went to
[41:03] their own company and reported all that
[41:05] the chief priests and elders had said
[41:06] unto them and when they had heard that
[41:08] they they lifted up their voice to god
[41:10] with one accord and said lord thou art
[41:13] god which hath made the heaven and the
[41:14] earth and the sea and all that is in it
[41:16] who by the mouth of thy servant david
[41:18] has said
[41:19] why did the heathen rage and the people
[41:21] imagine vain things the kings of the
[41:23] earth stood up and the rulers were
[41:24] gathered together against the lord and
[41:27] against christ for of a truth against
[41:29] thy holy child jesus whom now has
[41:31] anointed both herod and pontius pi pilot
[41:34] with the gentiles and the people of
[41:36] israel were gathered together for to do
[41:38] whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[41:39] determined before to be done and now
[41:42] lord behold thy threatenings and grant
[41:44] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[41:47] they may speak thy word
[41:50] by stretching forth a hand to heal that
[41:52] the signs and wonders may be done in the
[41:54] name of the holy child jesus and when
[41:56] they had prayed the place was shaken
[41:59] where they had assembled together and
[42:01] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[42:03] and they spake the word of god with
[42:05] boldness
[42:09] i i can't help but think you know
[42:10] there's a couple places where the ground
[42:12] shook the other place
[42:13] speaking of boldness with paul and silas
[42:16] were in prison and they they were locked
[42:18] up and they were shackled and their
[42:19] chain there and and they could have been
[42:21] boohoo and they could have been asking
[42:23] for deliverance but they begin to sing
[42:26] they begin to praise god and the bible
[42:28] says that the jail house was shaken
[42:33] and it's just me but i can't help but
[42:35] wonder if god in this instance and acts
[42:39] and later on with paul that god got so
[42:41] moved that he said
[42:43] that's my child
[42:45] that's my kids
[42:47] he got so excited
[42:49] he had to shake the earth because
[42:50] nothing else
[42:55] god got
[42:56] excited seeing the boldness of his
[43:00] children in practice
[43:02] be bold with the gospel
[43:04] oh don't be don't
[43:06] brother braham said
[43:08] this is a this you gotta remember
[43:09] brother brahms the one who preached the
[43:11] oddball but he said don't be odd
[43:14] don't be rude
[43:18] if they won't accept it dust your feet
[43:20] and walk on
[43:22] but don't be afraid to share what god
[43:24] has given you
[43:25] and when you're under that lie and
[43:26] anointing you feel that boldness upon
[43:28] you and especially if you're a new
[43:30] christian don't let anybody totally let
[43:32] anybody steal your joy
[43:33] don't let anybody steal that fire
[43:36] share what you got
[43:38] because it's a and anointing
[43:40] didn't last long for the church
[43:44] didn't last a whole long time
[43:46] it was about the first 300 years
[43:48] now that's not to say that there weren't
[43:50] times
[43:51] i believe that
[43:52] luther under the anointing of the man
[43:56] had a little bit of the lion when he
[43:57] walked down to the church house one day
[43:59] when his with his thesis
[44:03] under the anointing of the man he wrote
[44:04] it
[44:06] but under the anointing of the lion he
[44:08] nailed it to the door
[44:15] these
[44:17] god can change directions whenever he
[44:19] wants
[44:21] whichever way he directs
[44:23] under that anointing matthew under that
[44:26] lion anointing you'll go that way
[44:28] sometimes and sometimes he'll switch and
[44:29] go a different direction and and you
[44:31] know that lion anointing we talk about
[44:33] the five-fold ministry
[44:34] the the lion anointing is the evangelist
[44:40] that's just it doesn't mean he's not
[44:41] doesn't have some of the other
[44:42] anointings
[44:43] but predominantly an evangelist is
[44:45] underlying anointing
[44:48] hey he don't have to stick around and
[44:49] and see where the chips fall
[44:54] he comes in he preaches he lays it out
[44:56] he he
[44:58] he's got boldness he's on fire the whole
[45:00] church is praising they're jumping all
[45:01] over the place
[45:03] he's under a lying anointing
[45:06] you got sick among you come up here boom
[45:09] meanwhile the pastor is under a knocks
[45:10] anointing
[45:12] brother ram said he was the ox of the of
[45:14] the team
[45:15] he carries the weight
[45:17] he's the one that picks up the chips
[45:20] he's the one that after peter cuts off
[45:22] an ear puts the balm on
[45:26] he's the one
[45:27] he's under under predominantly an ox
[45:29] anointing the teacher is under a man
[45:31] anointing
[45:34] it's not to say that teachers can't get
[45:35] bold i love it when a teacher gets so
[45:37] excited about what he's preaching he
[45:38] just forgets he's a teacher and just
[45:40] becomes an evangelist for a while
[45:42] or a pastor does
[45:46] doesn't mean you're stuck in any water
[45:47] there's a there's a there's an overall
[45:49] progression
[45:51] of the church heading towards an eagle
[45:53] anointing
[45:54] but in different times we don't throw
[45:56] the we don't throw the other three
[45:58] gospels away just because we're under
[45:59] the eagle anointing do we
[46:02] we'll get to the eagle and anointing
[46:03] this afternoon
[46:05] well we'll talk
[46:07] i think i got enough time to at least
[46:08] break open on the oxen ointing here well
[46:11] we see matthew
[46:13] the kingdom of heaven
[46:15] that reference over and over again all
[46:17] the parables setting up the kingdom
[46:18] letting us understand that the kingdom
[46:20] of heaven suffers violence and the
[46:21] violence taketh by force
[46:24] and we see this because he's preparing
[46:26] the way
[46:27] for the next horse rider that red horse
[46:29] rider where war is going to break out
[46:32] and he's going to be red with the blood
[46:33] of the saints
[46:34] and jesus makes this proclamation he
[46:36] says i didn't come to bring peace
[46:39] but a sword
[46:41] doesn't mean that jesus is the one who
[46:43] declares war but when the gospel comes
[46:49] there's going to be a battle
[46:51] when god opens opens the door when god
[46:55] begins to move when god begins to enter
[46:57] into your life that's when the fight
[46:59] comes
[47:00] there's a quote brother branham says you
[47:01] know
[47:02] somebody asked him i said you know when
[47:03] you get the holy ghost can you make
[47:04] small mistakes can you
[47:06] can you do things that are wrong and i'm
[47:09] paraphrasing here she'll forgive me if i
[47:10] don't get it just exactly right but
[47:12] brother braham says oh certainly he says
[47:13] that's when the battle begins
[47:17] until you have the holy ghost
[47:20] you have no
[47:22] defenses you have nothing to withstand
[47:26] the assault of satan you will give in
[47:29] you will fall you will be pulled under
[47:31] eventually
[47:33] but god raises a standard against it
[47:36] through the new birth through the holy
[47:38] ghost to to carry you through to get you
[47:40] through whatever's coming down the road
[47:46] amen
[47:51] all right now remember the first age was
[47:52] the lion age the lion age of the tribe
[47:54] of judah christ is his own influence of
[47:57] life taken that age that's the first
[47:59] beast which means power
[48:02] that answered the human voice the next
[48:03] was the ox age the dark horse riders age
[48:06] see now the reason the first age was a
[48:08] white age i always heard people say that
[48:10] the first rider the white was the power
[48:11] of the church going forth to conquer we
[48:13] found out he was given a crown and that
[48:15] was it it was the church it was a church
[48:17] but where did it go went to rome
[48:19] that's what he did he received the crown
[48:21] now the second age was a red horse rider
[48:23] which is the dark age
[48:27] now
[48:28] and brother branham being in the role of
[48:30] a restorer
[48:32] remember i said i can't preach anything
[48:34] new
[48:35] william branham didn't preach anything
[48:36] new
[48:37] when he preached the seals where did he
[48:39] go back to matthew 24.
[48:41] he went back into the bible
[48:44] people are critical from him because
[48:46] because he didn't pull something out of
[48:47] the air if he had pulled something out
[48:48] of there they just said you can't add to
[48:50] or take away from the bible
[48:53] which is absolutely true which is why he
[48:55] went into the bible
[48:58] and connected the dots
[49:00] and we see irenaeus the second church
[49:02] age messenger we got church age yeah
[49:04] right there
[49:05] radius there he is right there right
[49:07] above paul arena said this he said for
[49:10] the cherubims two were four faced their
[49:11] faces were the images of dispensation of
[49:13] the son of god the first living creature
[49:15] was like a lion symbolizing his
[49:17] effectual working his leadership and
[49:19] royal power the second was like a calf
[49:21] signifying his sacrificial and sacred
[49:24] order and the third hat as it were the
[49:26] face of a man an evident description of
[49:29] his advent as a human being and the
[49:31] fourth was a flying eagle pointing out
[49:33] the gift of the spirit hovering with his
[49:34] wings over the church and therefore the
[49:36] gospels are in accord with these things
[49:38] among which christ is seated
[49:42] he had a pretty good revelation back
[49:43] then
[49:44] but we had a prophet who came in this
[49:45] day
[49:47] who took that and and and opened it to
[49:49] us and help us to see even more what was
[49:52] going on
[49:54] and we have the benefit of looking back
[49:56] in time
[49:57] and seeing that that first age for about
[50:00] 300 years that white horse rider went
[50:02] and at the end of that first 300 years
[50:04] he gets a crown
[50:06] right now i want you to understand he
[50:09] was given a crown
[50:11] jesus earned the crown
[50:14] remember satan offered him one
[50:17] ban down and worship me and i'll give
[50:18] you all the kingdoms of the world
[50:21] jesus said you're not giving me anything
[50:23] right amen
[50:31] when that crown of thorns was placed
[50:33] upon his head
[50:36] he could have at any moment
[50:38] that's right
[50:40] separated eternity
[50:42] and and time and allowed the angels to
[50:45] pour out of heaven into this world and
[50:48] cleanse it clean
[50:52] but he allowed the thorns to be placed
[50:54] upon his head
[50:57] and those scars will be there
[51:00] through all eternity
[51:03] he earned it
[51:05] but satan was given a crown here at the
[51:09] at the at the around 380 the fourth
[51:11] century
[51:13] two uh major events take place that that
[51:16] switches over from the lion age into the
[51:19] ox age and that was first the the
[51:22] council of niacia actually i'm getting
[51:24] my dates mixed up here i think it was
[51:25] constantine maybe first
[51:28] the constantine or or nicea that was
[51:30] first i don't remember
[51:32] they were within a few years of each
[51:34] other that's all that matters
[51:36] i'm not a historian friends
[51:39] but in that that fourth century what
[51:41] takes place is constantine
[51:43] gets a vision and he says under this
[51:45] sign you will conquer
[51:48] and he places the cross upon his shields
[51:51] and he switches
[51:53] pagan rome
[51:54] to papal rome
[51:56] and the roman empire that put
[51:59] thousands of christians to death in the
[52:02] lion's dens and in the gladiatorial
[52:05] arenas
[52:07] who who paul worked with and for to
[52:10] persecute the church
[52:13] suddenly became its biggest
[52:16] hero and what happened is
[52:19] satan jumped from his white horse to his
[52:21] red horse
[52:23] he'd secured at niacia he secured his
[52:27] religious goals
[52:29] the first stage of his ministry
[52:32] we've got a and
[52:34] this is how he works and i want to break
[52:36] this down
[52:38] for you we'll get into the other stuff
[52:40] this afternoon but
[52:43] we can look at the catholic church and
[52:44] we can say yeah you got off track here
[52:45] you got off track there but remember
[52:47] with things
[52:48] became traditions
[52:50] became doctrine
[52:51] which rendered the gospel of no effect
[52:55] don't think it doesn't try to get in to
[52:58] message churches
[53:04] brotherham did this brother did that
[53:06] show me a quote
[53:08] and not an isolated quote
[53:10] but show me
[53:12] his life that went with it
[53:17] and and it's fine you want to wear an
[53:18] eagle boat buckle that is fine
[53:22] but if you think that you have any
[53:24] spiritual significance to wearing an
[53:26] eagle belt buckle that you're getting an
[53:28] extra star in heaven
[53:33] you're rendering the gospel of no effect
[53:37] but the gospel says that you weren't
[53:39] good enough so christ did it for you and
[53:42] now you're accepted in the beloved
[53:46] the whole world is looking for
[53:47] acceptance
[53:48] accept me accept me as i am
[53:51] i i'm a man who wants to become a woman
[53:53] so i can win a gold medal at swimming
[53:56] accept me as i am
[53:58] even though i couldn't accept
[54:00] who i was
[54:05] oh we're gonna get kicked off youtube
[54:07] for this i don't know
[54:10] it's the truth anyhow
[54:14] but people are looking for acceptance
[54:16] and and and
[54:19] we'll we'll get to it maybe later but
[54:21] we'll just open it now brother bram
[54:22] skipped all around on the seal so i do
[54:24] it too so
[54:26] they the church makes merchandise of
[54:28] hope
[54:32] oh you can be accepted
[54:33] you're homosexual god will accept you
[54:35] the way you are
[54:37] and there's a truth there he certainly
[54:38] will
[54:39] but he won't allow you to stay the way
[54:41] you are
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:49] peter said some of you were effeminate
[54:51] you were man stealers you were
[54:52] adulterers you were killers you were you
[54:54] were all these things
[54:56] some of you were those things
[55:00] but god you know those are the two the
[55:02] two greatest words in the entire bible
[55:05] the entire
[55:07] human language the two most important
[55:09] words in the entire human language are
[55:11] these but god
[55:14] i don't care what situation you're
[55:15] facing i don't care how the devil comes
[55:17] against you you introduce those two
[55:19] words
[55:24] under the anointing of a lion
[55:27] and boldness
[55:28] or the anointing of an ox
[55:31] of god i've
[55:32] carried about as much as i can stand
[55:35] but god
[55:37] will step in
[55:38] satan you've come against me but god
[55:40] will prevail
[55:41] with with
[55:42] with the intelligence of a man
[55:44] devil you've done this before and it
[55:46] never worked out for you so guess what
[55:48] but god is going to going to help us
[55:51] or you can step in one of the anointing
[55:52] of an eagle
[55:55] but god is watching over me
[55:58] but god meant this for good
[56:00] what you meant for eagle
[56:02] all these different anointings playing
[56:04] all right i'm winding down
[56:07] i got
[56:10] that clock's right right
[56:12] okay
[56:19] all right so we'll break into the to the
[56:22] uh uh
[56:23] to the ox here we'll get into that
[56:26] because we see that that first 300 years
[56:28] that's where we're going the first 300
[56:29] years
[56:30] we see that and the red horse rider
[56:32] starts to ride and from 300 a.d
[56:35] to about 1500 a.d
[56:37] that red horse rider rides
[56:40] and it's all at war
[56:43] what was kind of under the covers before
[56:45] remember in the first church age you
[56:47] hate the deeds of the nicolaitans
[56:49] now they're sneaking into the church and
[56:51] now now it's open warfare
[56:55] now christians are dying for their faith
[56:58] all these things are taking place and we
[56:59] enter into this ox time and and as we
[57:02] talk about this and i'll reiterate it
[57:04] this afternoon
[57:05] the ox time
[57:07] i know the
[57:09] the ox age is the probably the least
[57:11] glamorous
[57:14] we don't think of an uh an ox or a calf
[57:17] as being that powerful
[57:19] but i don't think any of you any of you
[57:22] would willingly jump into the bull ring
[57:27] in madrid or
[57:30] mexico city
[57:32] an ox has got some power when he needs
[57:34] it
[57:37] it's not the strength of a lion
[57:39] you don't hitch a lion to your
[57:41] your cart
[57:44] you hitch an ox to it
[57:47] there's some strength and power there
[57:48] i've seen ox's fling
[57:50] lines
[57:52] there's some strength there
[57:54] but it's a persevering
[57:57] it's an enduring brother branham
[57:59] preached perseverance or persevering
[58:01] that message 14 times
[58:05] more than any other message that was you
[58:07] know as preachers we have pocket sermons
[58:11] if i go somewhere and i don't know what
[58:12] to preach i got two or three of them
[58:13] that are always when i'm in a jam
[58:16] i know god works for him
[58:19] he always shows up when i preach those
[58:21] sermons
[58:22] perseverance was brother branham's
[58:23] because he knew we would be going
[58:25] through
[58:26] some ox ages
[58:28] we'd be going under an ox anointing
[58:32] 1200 years
[58:33] the church spent under an oxen window
[58:39] it's not the most glamorous time there's
[58:41] going to be times in your christian walk
[58:44] where you don't feel the power of god
[58:49] abraham went 25 years brother graham
[58:51] said without hearing the voice of god
[58:58] most y'all go 25 days and you ain't talk
[59:00] to god you're in so much deep trouble
[59:04] i know i am
[59:07] 25 years
[59:12] but it's an ox age
[59:19] we'll read the opening and mark
[59:23] because schofield has
[59:25] i'm not i'm not a great speaker
[59:27] obviously i'm enthusiastic i've got
[59:29] energy
[59:31] uh i'll make a a joyful noise
[59:36] i i preach
[59:37] slightly better than i sing which is
[59:38] awful
[59:41] i heard amen out there somebody heard me
[59:42] saying
[59:44] brother wade have you been listening to
[59:45] me singing
[59:56] if i could have been called to do
[59:57] anything we don't get choices in this
[59:59] life
[1:00:01] i would love to be able to sing like the
[1:00:02] angels
[1:00:05] i croak like a frog
[1:00:08] but the writer the second gospel mark
[1:00:09] also called john was the son of the new
[1:00:11] testament testament mary's and the
[1:00:13] nephew of barnabas he was associated to
[1:00:14] the apostles apostles and as mentioned
[1:00:17] in the writings of paul and luke
[1:00:19] lists all the scriptures you can look it
[1:00:20] up yourself date of mark has been placed
[1:00:23] between a.d 57 and 63. the scope and
[1:00:26] purpose of the book are evident from its
[1:00:28] contents in it jesus is seen as the
[1:00:31] mighty worker rather than the unique
[1:00:33] teacher
[1:00:34] it is the gospel of jehovah's servant of
[1:00:37] the branch as matthew is the gospel of
[1:00:40] the branch unto david jeremiah 33 15
[1:00:43] everywhere the servant character of the
[1:00:46] incarnate son is manifest the key verse
[1:00:49] is 1045 for even the son of man came not
[1:00:52] to be ministered unto but to minister
[1:00:56] the characteristic word is straightway a
[1:00:59] servant's word
[1:01:00] there is no genealogy for who gives the
[1:01:03] genealogy of a servant
[1:01:08] the distinctive character of christ and
[1:01:10] mark is set forth in philippians 2 6
[1:01:13] through 8
[1:01:15] who thought it not robbery
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:22] to become a servant
[1:01:27] but this lowly servant who emptied
[1:01:28] himself with the form of god was found
[1:01:30] in fashion as a man was nevertheless the
[1:01:32] mighty god as mark distinctly declares
[1:01:35] in one one and therefore the mighty
[1:01:36] works accompanied are authenticated
[1:01:39] and authenticated his mystery ministry
[1:01:42] as befits the servant gospel mark is
[1:01:45] characteristically a gospel of deeds
[1:01:47] rather than
[1:01:49] words
[1:01:51] james was a reader of mark james was
[1:01:54] under an anointing
[1:01:55] uh a a an ox anointing
[1:01:58] fakes faith without works
[1:02:00] is dead
[1:02:06] there's
[1:02:06] there's times in your christian walk i
[1:02:09] i'd love to be a prosperity preacher
[1:02:13] i'd love to be so easy
[1:02:18] but i'm one of those ministers who's
[1:02:20] been called to preach the truth
[1:02:24] and certainly there is some prosperity
[1:02:26] to the gospel god promised to bless you
[1:02:30] absolutely
[1:02:33] but you're not getting a crown without a
[1:02:34] cross
[1:02:39] there are things you're going to have to
[1:02:41] give up there are sacrifices you're
[1:02:42] going to have to make there are going to
[1:02:44] be loved ones that you lose along the
[1:02:46] way there are going to be friends that
[1:02:47] turn their back on you there's going to
[1:02:49] be heartache there's going to be pain
[1:02:53] that is the reality of life
[1:02:59] we know this
[1:03:01] and i guess we'll end here
[1:03:05] and i don't know if i shared this with
[1:03:06] you all before but
[1:03:09] a christian never loses really loses
[1:03:11] anything
[1:03:13] you know that
[1:03:15] never lose anything
[1:03:21] brother brown had a chair
[1:03:25] him and his wife bought making payments
[1:03:27] on it
[1:03:28] times got hard they couldn't make
[1:03:29] payments on

[1:03:34] he had a dog when he was a 16 year old
[1:03:36] boy
[1:03:38] fritz
[1:03:40] he loved that dog
[1:03:42] we get attached to animals

[1:03:46] that's part of our
[1:03:48] uh some some of y'all that aren't animal
[1:03:50] lovers some of us are just fulfilling

[1:04:04] all right
[1:04:05] that's all right we'll take care of that
[1:04:06] part

[1:04:24] had killed i was waiting there for him
[1:04:29] his horse prince was there
[1:04:33] and when he went in the house there was
[1:04:34] a chair sitting there
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:43] he said his wife said they won't take
[1:04:45] this one
[1:04:49] so we get into the ox age you know this
[1:04:51] there's going to be sacrifice there's
[1:04:52] going to be pain there's going to be
[1:04:53] hard times
[1:04:55] if i if i told you any less i wouldn't
[1:04:57] be an honest preacher
[1:05:00] but know this
[1:05:02] god will carry you through
[1:05:05] and a christian
[1:05:06] never
[1:05:07] loses
[1:05:08] anything
