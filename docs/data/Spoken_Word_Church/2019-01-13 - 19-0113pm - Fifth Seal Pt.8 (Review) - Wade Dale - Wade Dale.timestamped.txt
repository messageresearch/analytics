[12:43] adulterous mother Eve they men and what

[12:56] it's not no miracle lather there's no
[12:59] where we're coming to that but what

[13:17] out of Mary was changed and now he's
[13:20] still standing in it the one who has
[13:23] reached immortality and we're heading in
[13:27] that direction good to be in the house
[13:29] of the Lord
[13:30] got a couple announcements myself adult
[13:33] group practice after second service
[13:35] please stay in the building so they
[13:38] don't have to track you down
[13:40] everybody got that again adults who are
[13:42] singing in the group practice after the
[13:46] second service that would be in a few
[13:48] minutes hours stay in the sanctuary okay
[13:54] also there's a black chair downstairs
[13:56] the one that Tony Tony I'm giving you a
[13:59] chair away son sorry the one brother
[14:01] Tony Smallwood sits in but it's our old
[14:03] chair that used to be up here if anybody
[14:05] wants that please
[14:07] make it disappear today please make it
[14:12] disappear today we have like seven
[14:15] chairs in our house and we don't need
[14:16] another one
[14:17] so it's a nice leather chair brother
[14:20] Tony I tell you how it sits this pretty
[14:21] good brother Tony doesn't see it ya see
[14:23] that bus is good so make it disappear
[14:26] but also good to have other Chris
[14:28] rentals with her hadn't seen him in a
[14:30] while have been a few years and he's not
[14:32] a stranger to the message he's been
[14:33] around for a while he he hangs out with
[14:38] brother Larry and that's alright they've
[14:45] been friends for a long time though and
[14:47] and we've got to know him over the years
[14:49] and he's he's watched in a few times so
[14:52] he's not a stranger he's not somebody we
[14:54] have to background for so I also
[14:57] remember one thing les several years ago
[15:00] brother down told us that when we did
[15:02] our prayer request to make sure we put
[15:05] them in before the service started now
[15:07] if you don't get here before the service
[15:08] started that's your fault but you need
[15:11] to put your request on a piece of paper
[15:13] and give it to brother Terrence not so
[15:15] much to be done out in the congregation
[15:16] now brother Dale said that already
[15:18] several years ago so it it needs to be
[15:21] done that way that's the way he wants it
[15:23] done so we need kind of we kind of
[15:25] slipped from that every once in a while
[15:27] it's kind like a teacher you know you
[15:28] you get by with it a few times and then
[15:31] then you know you see something about it
[15:33] so make sure you put your prayer request
[15:34] in on the sheet of paper where it says
[15:36] prayer request and hand it to brother
[15:38] Terrence or either led up here on the
[15:39] pulpit very simple like I said if you
[15:42] don't get here for service starts though
[15:43] that's your fault put it in later or
[15:47] give it somewhere else but that's the
[15:49] way brother Dale wants it that's the way
[15:51] we need to do it it needs to be an order
[15:52] put your prayer request in and if you
[15:55] want to have a testimony you got okay
[15:57] brother Dale so you make sure you do
[15:59] that also okay let's just keep things in
[16:01] order
[16:02] amen just keep things in order that went
[16:05] supposed to be you know what the Lord is
[16:07] pleased with order he like he does not
[16:09] like chaos the Lord loves order so we we
[16:12] do too so let's pull it open our Bibles
[16:14] or plot revelation 6 today we're just
[16:17] going to review the 5th seal again
[16:21] brother Dale and I were talking about a
[16:23] few things when way back from to and
[16:26] from the hunting club the other day and
[16:27] I think I need to do one more so he
[16:32] brother Dale's never the one that really
[16:34] says you need to do this but if he
[16:37] starts talking about something that's
[16:39] the suggestion to do it so because the
[16:43] Lord speaks to him speaks to all of us
[16:45] if you like you downstairs in Sunday
[16:46] school class I said look whatever we're
[16:48] gonna do what y'all want to do y'all get
[16:51] together decide what we want to do in a
[16:52] Sunday School class it can't be just me
[16:54] me me all the time take suggestions and
[16:57] and you know what if you filled with the
[16:58] Holy Ghost and God may speak to you one
[17:00] day and he doesn't speak to me and you
[17:02] know what we're supposed to be able to
[17:03] accept that and say well let's do it
[17:05] this way
[17:06] right like brother Jason Watkins Friday
[17:09] night did an outstanding job he's he
[17:11] said I've been doing this at my at my
[17:13] church for ever how long he said he said
[17:16] and I keep wanting to go this way and he
[17:17] said the Lord just does not want me to
[17:20] go this way so you know he kind of beard
[17:22] off and I like what he said he said Lord
[17:24] he said you're here you've been here he
[17:30] said I'm just showing up behind the
[17:31] pulpit so use me okay to let him do the
[17:36] speaking cuz if I do the speaking it's
[17:37] just a meeting of minds but it's the
[17:39] Lord to do the speaking then we ought to
[17:41] see that that that's the way God speaks
[17:44] to us through a fivefold ministry that's
[17:46] the way he speaks to us and and that's
[17:49] just the way it is and that's another
[17:50] thing that's just that's the way God
[17:51] liked it you know why because God's all
[17:53] down through eternity that that's the
[17:54] way it would work so he put apostles
[17:58] prophets pastors teachers and
[17:59] evangelists in the church for what the
[18:01] perfecting of the saints and we're all
[18:05] saints that are baptized with the Holy
[18:08] Ghost we are the Saints of God so we're
[18:11] just going to review a little bit today
[18:12] but bring up maybe one or two more
[18:14] little BT points just to reiterate this
[18:16] fifth seal because truly as you get to
[18:19] studying a little more on it it opens up
[18:23] more and more and more and that's why
[18:25] folks today it's supposed to do that
[18:27] supposed to open up more and more and
[18:29] let's remember brother how he failed
[18:31] downstairs a few minutes ago so let's
[18:33] just remember him and pray he's okay
[18:35] the table and chair wasn't too good but
[18:37] he's okay but let's remember him in
[18:39] prayer he kind of lost his balance we
[18:41] need to we need all help each other out
[18:43] physically and spiritually a man
[18:46] so let's bow our heads before we get
[18:47] started tell me father we thank you for
[18:49] this day Lord we're in 2019 who would
[18:53] have thought it
[18:54] but we're here you knew that it was not
[18:57] a secret to you father it was just
[19:00] something that we didn't think was going
[19:04] to happen but I think in your Bible you
[19:07] told us that your ways are not our ways
[19:09] and your thoughts are higher than ours
[19:12] and you knew we would need this length
[19:14] of time to come to maturity so here we
[19:18] are lord I pray that you would truly be
[19:22] the active participant in the service
[19:24] you take over Lord and you do the
[19:26] speaking you do the hearing you do the
[19:29] revealing and follow me brother how
[19:31] touch his body as he's limped up there
[19:34] up the steps Lord we pray that you just
[19:36] touch him right now Lord and this you'll
[19:38] restore him back everyone in this
[19:41] building Lord needs to touch from You
[19:43] Father and as the word goes forth we
[19:45] pray that whatever whatever symptom that
[19:49] we brought in this building that we will
[19:52] not leave with it that it will be taken
[19:54] care of because you said you sent your
[19:57] word and healed us and as we know that
[19:59] you are the word and the word now has
[20:03] become flesh and the word is here it's
[20:08] breathing it's living it's it's not dry
[20:11] bones anymore it's a living group of
[20:14] people and you knew we would be here so
[20:17] you equipped us for this moment you
[20:20] equipped us for this time now I pray
[20:23] that we would use that equipment that we
[20:26] would listen and hear understand what
[20:32] you're saying
[20:32] father just forgive us of our sins and
[20:35] blessings be with the missionaries on
[20:36] the foreign fields we always say Lord
[20:39] give them fruit for their labor father
[20:40] because they truly are laboring for you
[20:42] thank you for bringing brother Lewis
[20:43] back in the family Lord we we're under
[20:46] anticipation for the
[20:48] for the service Wednesday - to tell us
[20:51] some of the great things that God's
[20:52] doing another country bless the rest of
[20:55] the service Lord you take over in Jesus
[20:57] name Amen alright revelation 6 verse 9
[21:01] and when he had opened the fifth seal I
[21:03] saw under the altar the souls of them
[21:04] that were slain for the word of God and
[21:06] for the testimony which they held they
[21:09] cried with a loud voice saying how long
[21:11] O Lord holy and true that's now not
[21:14] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[21:16] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[21:18] given unto every one of them and it was
[21:20] said unto them that they should rest yet
[21:22] for a little season until their fellow
[21:24] servants also in their brethren that
[21:26] should be killed as they were should be
[21:29] fulfilled and you may be seated in the
[21:31] word add his blessing to the reading of
[21:33] the word now I want to I'll get it in
[21:34] just a second I think I'm on we might
[21:37] just hang loose every minute brother
[21:40] Danny's won't know if we're going to use
[21:41] the board we just might use it and we
[21:42] might not be less let's just look at our
[21:44] review if you want to pull the review up
[21:47] on the board again I want to kind of go
[21:50] slower through the review just for a
[21:51] second to get us as we were talking the
[21:56] other day this fifth seal brings a lot
[21:59] of things into view and we're going to
[22:00] try to prioritize them a little bit
[22:03] later in the service but we're going to
[22:05] try to get over this first part of the
[22:07] review because love as we see the first
[22:13] seal open I read it last night I'm
[22:17] starting into the sixth seal reading a
[22:18] little bit and if you're reading ahead
[22:20] of me or reading in the seal book right
[22:22] at the first brother branham says and
[22:24] it's kind of ironic that this morning we
[22:26] read and we're going through the book of
[22:29] Romans so I think it was Romans 11 or 12
[22:31] or 13
[22:33] good to have you with us again said I
[22:35] forgot test film y'all were here we're
[22:37] happy
[22:38] what brother Rafael okay alright well
[22:42] good to have you here they're not
[22:43] strangers either they've been here
[22:45] before hey man good to have you sister
[22:48] and your and your and your daughter with
[22:50] you you just grown up Wow so we look at
[22:54] the seal the seal brother Aaron said
[22:55] there's two powers that's what we were
[22:57] talking about this morning in the book
[22:58] of Romans there is there's a there's
[23:01] only one power and that's the power of
[23:03] Almighty God and man Satan has really no
[23:06] power remember all the seals we've been
[23:10] reading power was given power was given
[23:13] power was given you and I give Satan the
[23:16] power amen but there's a higher power
[23:22] there is a power of God then there is no
[23:26] other power he permits Satan and what
[23:29] Satan does is he prevents the power of
[23:32] God because you're not really read back
[23:35] in the seal and I saw when the lamb
[23:37] opened one of the seals don't have to go
[23:38] to it and I heard it were the noise of
[23:40] thunder one of the beasts saying come
[23:41] and see this is when we first started
[23:42] behold a white horse and him it's Aaron
[23:44] had a boat a crown was given unto him
[23:47] and went forth conquering and to conquer
[23:48] second seal they went out another horse
[23:51] it was red and power was given to him
[23:53] and that they should kill one another
[23:57] and there was given unto him a great
[23:59] sword power was given so there's only
[24:01] two there there's really brother branham
[24:04] does say there's two powers which is the
[24:06] Antichrist in Christ but really this guy
[24:10] over here is X doubt there's no power
[24:11] Satan has no power unless we give him
[24:14] the power mm so we need to stay under
[24:18] the power of God to take what God give
[24:20] us he is our head as we were talking
[24:24] this morning in a Sunday School class
[24:27] there's only one power well that's God
[24:29] and then he has power over us I wish you
[24:34] would understand that the fivefold
[24:36] ministry sure it's been set apart as a
[24:38] predestinated group to help us to
[24:41] perfection but if but if a pastor is
[24:44] preaching and
[24:45] I'm a teacher I become a sheep in the
[24:50] front row or whatever I become a sheep
[24:53] I'm not sitting over here in office
[24:55] outside of Olivia I'm sorry Olivia says
[25:01] you go over here and down that way and I
[25:03] did the very same after wasn't gonna do
[25:05] it one over there but if I said on the
[25:07] front row I become a sheep we're all
[25:08] sheep we're all female in the body of
[25:12] Christ we all have a head and then God
[25:15] tells us as you treat your wife so does
[25:19] God treat you because you are his wife
[25:22] and you have a head brother Dale is the
[25:26] head pastor of this church but he has a
[25:29] head that he has to talk to he's not set
[25:32] aside and now it's for all y'all but
[25:35] it's not I don't have to do that now
[25:37] that's not right
[25:38] that's the devil that you know what
[25:40] that's in the beginning the very
[25:43] anointing that Satan took was well I
[25:46] know your God but I want to have some
[25:49] power too I don't want to know I don't
[25:52] want to do that I want to do something
[25:54] different you see how contrary that is
[25:55] but God did annoy him he was the
[25:58] anointed cherub God gave him power to do
[26:01] things so we look in this seal there's
[26:03] there's the power of the white horse
[26:05] rider as he rides off I like what
[26:09] brother Bob was talking about Wednesday
[26:10] night man he did a good job winds you
[26:12] know I mean give him a hand you man
[26:15] telling him he did a good job but we
[26:19] must see that that we know one thing for
[26:22] sure the devil is near the devil is
[26:30] there but when you see that devil in
[26:34] that white horse right away from you
[26:41] there's a separation then God's becoming
[26:46] more prevalent in your life because
[26:48] you're getting rid of this part then
[26:51] you're getting rid of another part
[26:52] because look once we get rid of all four
[26:55] of these parts the bad part look what
[26:58] happens we take a body change and then
[27:01] so as the one horse rides away we truly
[27:05] need to see that that's a revelation
[27:07] that that doesn't bother you anymore
[27:11] things I used to do I do them no more
[27:16] right but that justification I kind of
[27:20] wrote myself a little note when you come
[27:23] to this you know when you come to baby
[27:24] form justification and I may spend a
[27:26] little more time I'm sorry on this but I
[27:28] feel good this way when you come into
[27:31] baby form justification you're just like
[27:33] a baby that is trying to walk you just
[27:39] fall everywhere and you beat your head
[27:42] and your knees and you you know you just
[27:45] look horrible but mom and dad is still
[27:49] going come on come on
[27:52] so you're what I'm saying is when you
[27:53] start in your Christian journey there's
[27:55] really your wobbling you you don't know
[27:58] really you still got that old root of
[28:01] bitterness in you in that baby for him
[28:02] justification you hadn't become
[28:04] born-again yet you've still got that old
[28:06] man inside of you he's not dead now he's
[28:09] he's choking he he's choking but he's
[28:14] not dead yet I mean you might be how
[28:16] that little grip around him but still
[28:18] he's talking right but that part of
[28:21] that's the baby form of your journey
[28:23] into Christianity you're not even really
[28:25] Christian anymore at that time you're
[28:27] not you're heading toward it and those
[28:30] who is justified he's already glorified
[28:32] but God's the only one who knows whether
[28:33] you gonna continue on or not okay you
[28:35] don't yet at the moment know even now
[28:38] that you're gonna take a body change are
[28:39] you gonna go by the grave you don't know
[28:41] that
[28:41] I've got to believe that we are in the
[28:45] process of that and that we're in the
[28:48] right channel got to be at the bus
[28:51] station to catch the bus
[28:53] amen somebody said that one time before
[28:55] don't sing
[28:56] got me at the bus station to catch the
[28:58] bus all right can't have a ticket for a
[29:02] train gotta be at the bus station all
[29:05] right
[29:05] so in that part of justification you
[29:07] really don't know what's going on but
[29:09] now this part of justification you're
[29:11] coming to a knowledge because you're
[29:15] already born again when the steel part
[29:17] is as though you never did it when that
[29:19] part of justification opens Cassie look
[29:22] the seals can't open to you unless
[29:24] you're a born again you can forget it
[29:27] the seals cannot open to you until
[29:30] you're born again but when you're born
[29:32] again then you come into the light of as
[29:35] though you never did it you're coming to
[29:39] a knowledge or you're not staggering
[29:41] because of worldly things anymore you
[29:45] know what you're doing you're staggering
[29:47] because there's some things that the
[29:48] preacher preaches that you don't
[29:50] understand there's some staggering going
[29:52] on when you match play and brother
[29:55] Branham says something you go wait a
[29:57] minute right all right oh you've never
[30:00] done that before
[30:01] come on people how many times have you
[30:04] hit rewind what's he saying write or go
[30:08] back and hear the preacher preach
[30:10] turn that again let me again well see
[30:14] that's that part of justification you're
[30:16] already born again you're already
[30:17] cleaned inside you're just working on
[30:18] the next guy you're working on your
[30:20] memories the conscious veck sees major
[30:22] nation alright but now look to me that
[30:25] really the seals in it is an
[30:28] introduction to the total plan of
[30:31] redemption when you start in this seal
[30:34] one that's not baby form justification
[30:37] but justification as though you never
[30:39] did it you're coming to a realization
[30:40] that number one I am the bride of Jesus
[30:43] Christ I like what brother Jason said
[30:47] Friday he used me and dad as an example
[30:50] he said my brother Wade there's no way
[30:52] that you can deny that that's your daddy
[30:55] but you did nothing to become his son
[30:59] you're just his son
[31:02] same way with God same way with God you
[31:06] come to that realization see that's
[31:10] where the people can't get it separated
[31:12] when they say you always was eternal
[31:13] they think when use a little baby you
[31:15] know but now now you come to the
[31:17] realization that everything was in God
[31:19] and then it transferred to you remember
[31:24] remember on the day of Pentecost brother
[31:26] Brown said they didn't become sons they
[31:29] were always sons well now they weren't
[31:31] always sons listen on the earth when
[31:33] they walked up and and said we don't
[31:35] understand what you're saying now they
[31:37] weren't a son of God at that time but
[31:39] now on the day of Pentecost because they
[31:42] were predestinated because they were in
[31:44] the mind of God because they had what
[31:47] representation that when the word did
[31:50] strike home they didn't have to say that
[31:52] in the more they just took the word that
[31:54] Jesus preached and they didn't need a
[31:56] tape recorder they didn't need somebody
[31:58] to write it down they didn't need a
[31:59] Bible they didn't have a Bible they were
[32:01] the Bible same way with you and I that's
[32:05] what we gotta we gotta evolve back into
[32:08] that we've come to a place to where we
[32:11] have to have quotes we have to have
[32:12] scripture we have to have this do we
[32:16] they didn't the first church never they
[32:21] didn't they any brought their own
[32:22] sermons down they just spoke as the
[32:25] Spirit gave them utterance by some
[32:32] people like notes and we have quotes to
[32:36] back up the notes but you know what
[32:39] somebody preaching false doctrine today
[32:41] has quotes to back up their nose so you
[32:46] have to be careful but listen I'm gonna
[32:50] make this statement and I'm gonna cover
[32:51] the whole thing in a nutshell if the
[32:55] seven seals or even let's just say this
[32:58] one through four if the first four seals
[33:00] have been made known to you now get what
[33:03] I'm saying then you're in the line for a
[33:07] glorified body
[33:09] because look after the fourth seal the
[33:12] rapture takes place all right so you're
[33:15] in a good line don't mean you will but
[33:18] you're in a good line you're you're at
[33:20] the bus station with a bus ticket now
[33:25] it's your problem to get their own time
[33:27] you can have hello you can have a bus
[33:31] ticket it's like I said Friday night it
[33:36] was supposed to this church post started
[33:37] 7 o'clock it's 7:15 brother Burleigh
[33:40] shows up shows up I told them I said 7
[33:44] o'clock was just a suggestion like now
[33:47] the Ten Commandments they're 10
[33:48] suggestions not Commandments they're
[33:50] just suggestions they suggest you do
[33:51] this but anyway we can't be late for the
[33:54] bus why because the bus is going to
[33:57] leave at 7:15 if that buses don't leave
[34:00] they're not gonna wait on you they might
[34:02] give you a little grace a couple of
[34:04] minutes if you're how many times you've
[34:05] been in the airport and you hear this
[34:08] and all you do is you see some little
[34:11] woman usually a woman don't hardly ever
[34:15] see men how old are you here she comes
[34:20] pulling her little face well she had her
[34:23] ticket she was heading to the right
[34:27] place to get on the plane she was you're
[34:29] late
[34:30] and I mean she I'm talking about a bride
[34:33] okay
[34:34] I hope you got that I'm not picking on
[34:36] the sisters I'm telling you we're all
[34:37] cheese we're the bride let's don't be
[34:40] doing this right cuz even a foolish
[34:46] virgin same same thing we need to buy
[34:52] our oil from you we need to take this
[34:54] journey we need some oil for life you're
[34:57] too late
[34:58] we've got just enough for us you should
[35:01] have been here when the bus took off
[35:02] because we fixing to leave right so
[35:06] let's go back to this no justification
[35:07] as though you never did it so we're
[35:08] coming to a time now to where when the
[35:11] seals opens to you I don't say that you
[35:14] can't be an error but I'm telling you
[35:17] you're you're getting into that line to
[35:19] where that when the seals open to you
[35:23] it's a special thing it's a special
[35:26] thing it's a special operation of God he
[35:30] has not revealed these seals to no one
[35:33] in all of 2000 years it has been sealed
[35:40] it was even sealed to the people in
[35:44] Jeffersonville Indiana in 1963 when
[35:47] brother Branham said it's gone from you
[35:48] it's not for you you're not even
[35:50] supposed to get it but you and I weren't
[35:54] there you and I are here now we are
[35:59] present I like what brother Jason said
[36:01] and I told him afterwards I said you
[36:03] should have went just a little bit
[36:04] further because you know he's talking
[36:07] about the I am how are you how are we
[36:08] gonna get out of here because he I am is
[36:11] ever-present right I said answer me a
[36:14] question when Moses walked up to Pharaoh
[36:18] they said let my people go
[36:20] Pharaoh said you and Aaron I got 50,000
[36:25] people out here you and Aaron who's
[36:27] gonna let you put who's gonna deliver
[36:28] these people Moses got a revelation at
[36:31] that moment he said I am I am so folks
[36:38] who birthed you into the body of Christ
[36:41] the I am so who's going to change your
[36:44] body I am
[36:46] who's going in a rapture I am make it
[36:51] personal
[36:53] because we're not if we are prophetic
[36:56] people but we are not prophesying we are
[37:01] part of the prophecy but if you prophesy
[37:04] that's telling of a future event this is
[37:08] not a future event this is reality so we
[37:13] come to justification it's not that
[37:16] we're back into the world and back out
[37:17] we're back into the world back out that
[37:19] was baby form justification
[37:21] now we're solid we've come to that
[37:23] statue of a perfect man where that big
[37:25] wide foundation of faith it's telling us
[37:28] it says though we never did it and we
[37:30] keep reading then we keep studying we
[37:32] keep eating
[37:33] then we come to sanctification we see
[37:36] that red horse that was riding in your
[37:39] life that red horse leaves sanctify God
[37:42] sanctify listen Satan will never think
[37:44] to fire you I promise you if you come to
[37:49] a stage of sanctification it is not the
[37:52] devil that did it
[37:55] but hold on a minute but he's gonna make
[38:00] you think you are saved in that position
[38:04] right there now not this one we're
[38:06] pointing I'm talking about baby form
[38:07] sanctification you come to baby for in
[38:09] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[38:11] out right seeketh RAF's walked in dry
[38:15] places seeks breath find his nut and
[38:16] comes back finds the house swept and
[38:20] garnished and bring seven of his other
[38:22] buddies with him and they enter and
[38:24] reside back in the house now that's not
[38:26] this right here we're not worried about
[38:29] the devil in the statue of a perfect man
[38:31] getting in your soul so you still got
[38:34] that you still got that control center
[38:37] in this part of sanctification and
[38:39] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[38:41] out baby form not this baby for him and
[38:45] he can come back brother perhaps they
[38:47] didn't come back and give you a
[38:48] religious spirit and make you think
[38:50] you're born again but now that's not in
[38:53] this one right here no no this is the
[38:56] statue of perfect man this is coming to
[38:57] the statue of the perfect man
[38:59] this is God dealing not with your soul
[39:02] but using your soul speaking to your
[39:04] soul and let your soul work out and then
[39:08] into the spirit realm because that's
[39:11] where we need our help how many times
[39:12] have we said that our spirit realm
[39:14] before we need help if you're so if
[39:16] you're so today at this very moment is
[39:19] either black or white it's either black
[39:23] was still sin or it's white with the new
[39:28] birth the Creator resides in your soul
[39:34] are the guy that got permitted power is
[39:37] residing attached to your soul and he's
[39:41] telling you what to do but in this part
[39:43] of sanctification what happens if that
[39:45] unclean spirit sure it gets out
[39:47] there but it tries to come back in but
[39:50] he can't get in the soul so he tries to
[39:52] reside in the spirit realm give you
[39:56] trouble like you would not believe but
[40:00] that's why the brother Dale has been
[40:01] through it we've all been through this
[40:02] that statue of a perfect man is the most
[40:05] ill taught subject in the message but it
[40:07] is the most important besides the new
[40:10] birth it's the most important step or
[40:13] message that could be brought because
[40:16] you can't understand the seals without
[40:20] that and the daniel-san what's how
[40:21] brother brown preach that he preached
[40:24] him almost in sequential order he
[40:28] preached the statute perfect man after
[40:30] he preached his heels right he preached
[40:33] him before spoken words regional seat
[40:36] before why because that's the
[40:38] preparation time to come into where and
[40:42] I believe that brother Branham could
[40:46] have stood on the week of that seal and
[40:48] somebody said brother Ram who's going to
[40:50] open these seals he said I am because he
[40:57] and you become so one with God Adam
[41:01] listen Adam was the I am of the day he
[41:09] was in flashing I was thinking about
[41:14] this yesterday God so God knew what Adam
[41:18] would do but he's so trusted Adam he
[41:21] said you take care of the world I'll
[41:23] take care of heaven every animal that he
[41:26] named he didn't listen
[41:27] even when Adam fell God didn't back up
[41:30] and say well now everything you've done
[41:32] at him I won't wipe off and do it again
[41:33] no he just kept right on going you know
[41:37] why cuz in genesis 3:15 he said i'm
[41:39] coming it's coming I am who's come
[41:48] because when Jesus was on the cross
[41:50] there was the I am he's gonna stay in
[41:54] the world I am
[41:56] that's why I said before Abraham was I
[41:59] am he identified exactly who he was and
[42:02] what he was doing everybody so
[42:07] sanctification is going up the statue a
[42:09] perfect man the black horse rider we
[42:12] showed us the new birth and they're not
[42:13] the new birth the first one the new
[42:14] birth sure now look it takes I was think
[42:19] about this the other day it when brother
[42:20] I made that statement about the two
[42:21] powers it takes a contrast remember
[42:25] brother Brown said it had there had to
[42:26] be a night time for you to enjoy the day
[42:29] the law of contrast so there had to be a
[42:32] darkness in your life we were all dark
[42:35] and then we were all dark but now even
[42:38] if the new birth something has to die
[42:39] that excuse me that old nature had to
[42:42] die so there had to be a death you had
[42:46] to put that thing in the ground so that
[42:47] you could what be married to Christ to
[42:50] get it you're already in the family
[42:52] remember you received the spirit of
[42:54] adoption that your new birth but you're
[42:55] going to receive the adoption to wit the
[42:59] redemption of the body in that in that
[43:01] new birth it's not a new new birth but
[43:04] why is the Holy Ghost written on a piece
[43:06] of tile right Holy Spirit actually it's
[43:10] a refilling of the same thing you got
[43:14] because the same thing you God's going
[43:16] to take you to heaven and then but you
[43:19] and I are working toward the body change
[43:21] without seeing death something never
[43:24] happened that's why it's so important
[43:30] that we don't prophesy because if you
[43:37] promise if you prophesy you die even
[43:40] Jesus prophesied he had to die brother
[43:42] Branham prophesied he had to die why
[43:46] because they were looking at a future
[43:47] event but when the I am is here that's
[43:52] not a prophecy sure Isaiah stood and
[43:56] said uh virgin shall conceive it took
[43:58] seven hundred years later
[44:00] but when Jesus stepped on the earth
[44:01] somebody might have said what in the
[44:04] world was out there talking about Jesus
[44:06] said I am
[44:08] because when he said before Abraham was
[44:11] I am
[44:12] he was telling them that before they
[44:14] even came on the earth he was already in
[44:16] the Old Testament ever present for
[44:22] eternity everybody all right so now seal
[44:28] number four now seal number four to me
[44:32] hugely important but if you don't get
[44:35] the other three here we go with the
[44:37] stepping stone or the stepping blocks or
[44:39] the corner stone if you don't get those
[44:42] you can't get how can you get if seal
[44:44] number four is brother Brown said all
[44:47] three combined well what if you leave
[44:49] one of them out you can't leave one out
[44:52] you got to go
[44:54] listen I've said this before I say it
[44:57] again if there was a better plan for God
[45:01] to get you where you need to be we would
[45:03] be doing it but this is it this is the
[45:08] plan of redemption we have to get in it
[45:12] go buy it and we'll be taken up because
[45:14] of mmm so who's gonna take a rapture I
[45:17] am you know why because it's all gonna
[45:22] come present because it's a future event
[45:25] but brother Branham said your rapture
[45:28] started when you became born again
[45:29] that's your new birth who's gonna be
[45:36] preaching one day who's gonna be in the
[45:39] congregation one day and Robert Tatum is
[45:42] gonna walk through the door I am see how
[45:48] personal that is that takes away
[45:51] trinitarianism when you see I am you
[45:54] don't see three you don't see one like
[46:03] your finger
[46:04] my brother Dell said this morning you
[46:06] see a mini membered body that is one
[46:10] because I am that I am
[46:15] so co4 we see it was a pale horse it was
[46:17] all three you've got to have
[46:19] justification sanctification and the
[46:21] baptism the Holy Ghost before you can
[46:23] take a body change we've got to step up
[46:26] into a higher form of justification
[46:28] sanctification about the whole go just
[46:30] like we're talking about here because
[46:31] the word truly is made flesh and who you
[46:39] to accept that God is their personal
[46:42] Savior I am I am everything now as I am
[46:46] I mean listen we can't say we we're not
[46:53] we're Gentiles or individuals Israel can
[46:58] said can say we are the 144,000 and we
[47:01] are going to take a rapture because
[47:04] Israel is saved as a nation you and I
[47:06] are not a we we're an i that's the one
[47:09] singular professor personal pronet one I
[47:13] I'm standing here today not three of me
[47:16] I am standing here today all right so
[47:20] who's gonna take a body change okay and
[47:25] brother Joe Canada pulled up a song and
[47:27] he sang it today about the I am we're
[47:28] gonna sing it maybe next unto your
[47:30] something man it's good but you know
[47:33] what that's a prophecy to you until you
[47:36] understand the I am is already here I
[47:39] love what brother Jason said he said
[47:42] most people in denominations are getting
[47:44] saved from a historical event think
[47:50] about that remember brother Brown said
[47:53] they couldn't get Jesus off the cross a
[47:54] historical Jesus is saving them because
[47:57] he's he did that back there but what
[48:01] about now that we know that he's right
[48:02] here he's the I am he's ever-present
[48:06] when I received the new birth it wasn't
[48:08] a God hanging on the cross it wasn't him
[48:11] a God in heaven it was a God that
[48:13] personally met me right here same way
[48:17] with you
[48:21] so now in the fourth seal the bride's
[48:23] caught up death is destroyed a
[48:26] resurrection has happened who's going to
[48:29] be part of the resurrection y'all
[48:32] haven't learned yet have you who's gonna
[48:33] be part of the resurrection thank you
[48:35] who's gonna be part of the body change I
[48:39] am this is getting good one more time
[48:42] and you know what though that I am
[48:45] though brings things to pass when Jesus
[48:49] said before Abraham was I am
[48:53] he brought it right there if they
[48:56] wouldn't understood you see how blinded
[48:58] they were he's telling them I am the one
[49:02] called Abraham I am the one I am
[49:07] Melchizedek he wasn't that wasn't a
[49:12] separate person if they would actually
[49:15] said well what about this milk Esme he
[49:17] said I am who was one who talked to
[49:21] Moses in the burning bush I am who's
[49:23] wanted talk to Adam in the Garden of
[49:26] Eden I am who's one who said let there
[49:29] be I am see what I mean
[49:32] it was ever-present right there the
[49:33] whole thing that makes it personal maybe
[49:37] that would help you a little bit
[49:38] alright seal number five is what we've
[49:40] been talking about now that we have to
[49:42] come and bring something else now I
[49:46] wrote myself a note I better read it
[49:50] because when we come to these four
[49:53] stages and take a rapture when we start
[49:56] this journey it's an introduction to the
[49:59] plan of redemption the full plan of
[50:04] redemption
[50:04] okay now the full plan of redemption is
[50:07] body spirit and so now a lot of people
[50:08] have come to redemption of the soul but
[50:12] they're in the grave their bodies not
[50:15] their spirit went back to God their body
[50:17] went in the grave and they went in the
[50:19] sixth dimension no no shame in that none
[50:23] zero zilch lord of mercy tax times
[50:26] coming up I wish I could sleep over and
[50:27] see the mansion for a little while
[50:29] by God rot Rebecca hey Rebecca does half
[50:34] of our taxes in this building so she
[50:36] knows what we're doing well she knows
[50:38] all y'all you know if we got some truth
[50:44] serum out week mm-hmm that's all right
[50:53] death and taxes that's the - sure of
[50:55] things right but they're not sure to us
[50:58] cuz he's gonna take a rapture this is
[51:01] gonna take a body shame okay everybody
[51:06] all right so when you come through your
[51:11] journey it's an introduction to the plan
[51:13] of redemption you're just learning it
[51:15] because you know what because you're
[51:17] still contrary brother Larry your body
[51:19] and your carnal mind is still contrary
[51:22] to this eternal thing that we got listen
[51:27] if we really understood the eternal
[51:29] thing we'd already be changed but we've
[51:32] got what go to prime Jesus went to a
[51:34] process my brother Dale said this
[51:37] morning sure Jesus didn't know all
[51:39] things he had what he had gray matter he
[51:41] had a brain that was a baby brain googoo
[51:45] gaga
[51:46] cried for mama but he was Almighty God
[51:49] but he was encapsulated in a flesh
[51:53] because he had to be your brother but if
[51:57] you could ask that little baby said
[51:58] who's gonna save the world he gonna say
[52:00] I am just let me grow up a little bit
[52:04] more get out of these diapers and I'm
[52:05] gonna help y'all out if that's to me
[52:08] that's the most real God I know they can
[52:11] be a baby and be a teenager and be all
[52:13] these different things to each one of us
[52:14] and he can laugh right now in another
[52:16] dimension that we just said that cuz he
[52:19] was here
[52:19] physically on this earth but if you
[52:22] would ask and we know that he didn't
[52:24] know it at that time I'm just making a
[52:25] point
[52:26] but I promise you though when he come to
[52:28] Calvary the devil that came to him in
[52:33] that garden that give him all that
[52:35] trouble remember he was troubled in the
[52:37] garden I believe he finally at one time
[52:40] he stopped Saints in Sweden
[52:43] you're gonna you're gonna go die for
[52:44] these people what do you though he says
[52:46] yes I am I've come to do this this is my
[52:51] job and my job is to get them to believe
[52:54] me cuz how many of y'all so Jesus
[52:57] hanging on cross you have to believe
[53:01] that's why we're believers brothers and
[53:03] sister Laurie that's why we see and
[53:07] never president I am we don't see her
[53:08] Jesus hanging on the cross uh we see an
[53:12] empty cross we have an empty cross on an
[53:14] empty tomb hey man you know why you know
[53:20] why he's in you he's hidden in flesh
[53:28] again hiding himself in simplicity now
[53:36] to me this seal number five is to
[53:42] justification where the real you never
[53:43] did it no we already talked about that
[53:45] but I believe that it really reveals
[53:50] where the I am is you saw no gods
[53:54] residing in me but do you really know
[53:56] that do you really know that but that's
[54:03] just hearsay though the dick said the
[54:06] word tells you absolutely no doubt
[54:08] that's where we get our that's where we
[54:09] get our thought but you got to know it
[54:13] you got to know it it's got to be where
[54:18] you say who's gonna move that mountain
[54:23] hey we're getting it that's what he said
[54:26] he said you say listen folks I'm telling
[54:31] you we got to start being a little bit
[54:32] independent
[54:33] [Applause]
[54:35] stop being Catholic Rodale save my kids
[54:41] brother l can't save your kids only God
[54:44] Almighty can save your kids we just have
[54:48] been commissioned to live before them
[54:51] Yeah right
[54:53] but you understand what I'm saying you
[54:57] pray for you kid you believe now we'll
[55:01] all believe no doubt as as a family of
[55:05] God we're believers but you got to
[55:08] believe and you got to say who's going
[55:11] to take a rapture oh no brother Dale is
[55:14] gonna go and I'm going with on his
[55:16] coattail you can't even go on Jesus's
[55:19] coattail that's hearsay never want to
[55:26] talked about hearsay the other day on in
[55:27] sermon that's it's all hearsay until it
[55:30] becomes a reality until you can speak it
[55:33] back yes a hearsay even these quotes
[55:37] that I'm gonna read you is hearsay but
[55:39] when that quote becomes a reality and it
[55:41] clicks in your mind and you say that
[55:43] ain't nothing but the truth
[55:44] you know what happens when the lady said
[55:45] that ain't nothing but the truth she
[55:48] said that ain't nothin but the truth
[55:52] because the IM was there so
[55:58] justification the real you never did it
[55:59] now this week gonna just for a second
[56:01] that this is the grace seal to me that's
[56:05] the thunder we know what the 5th seal is
[56:08] the 5th seal is to jews that were killed
[56:10] in our Eichmann and Hitler and are given
[56:12] robes we've been through this for seven
[56:14] sermons these are the people that were
[56:16] given robes not because they were
[56:18] Christians note that were given robes
[56:19] because God blinded their eyes literally
[56:23] blinded his own children's eyes so that
[56:26] you not could come in to me that but the
[56:30] Thunder underneath that is is that you
[56:34] you and you all know who you are
[56:41] no were you going but you know what
[56:44] you're doing here
[56:45] that 5th seal to me reveals that brother
[56:49] Dale and I were talking about what we're
[56:50] gonna get into a complete total plan of
[56:53] redemption for every person on the face
[56:56] of this earth that has lived from Adam
[56:58] to the Future home that's how powerful
[57:02] that fifth seal is and I'm gonna just
[57:04] not read we've read these that let's
[57:05] just brother Joe if you want to skip
[57:07] over actually just don't do anything
[57:12] let's bring that chart back just for a
[57:15] second
[57:16] Danny I'll get it don't worry about I'll
[57:18] get I'll get it
[57:22] stay right there you getting older you
[57:26] ain't as old as Joyce but you know I can
[57:29] say that George George to me are not the
[57:31] same age yet but in just a few more
[57:32] weeks we will be the same age and called
[57:36] her an old woman for a little while
[57:37] anyway older lady older sister 59 years
[57:45] old I was telling her Sunday School
[57:49] class downstairs me and daddy were
[57:51] talking about something other day and I
[57:52] saw about him being in message for so
[57:53] long he looked over man he said you've
[57:57] heard of this message 50 years remember
[58:00] you and I'm like I'm 58 we came into
[58:04] message when I was 8 years old yes I've
[58:06] been hearing brother Browns voice well
[58:07] now they was that gap in there when I
[58:09] didn't I wasn't a believer but I've been
[58:13] hearing this thing for 50 years hearing
[58:15] this message for 50 years think about
[58:17] your experience you've heard this
[58:18] message for 50 years and thank God for
[58:24] what grace that he's led us you know
[58:28] what I'm glad to rapture didn't plate
[58:29] take place in 1977 how many of y'all
[58:31] were even born before how many of you
[58:35] were believers in 1977 just a few y'all
[58:40] want to took a rapture and we'd have
[58:41] been here thank God thank God y'all
[58:44] mixed it
[58:49] thank God Jose revelation wasn't that
[58:52] good right ray Louise what were you born
[59:00] move well I'd tell brother Anderson to
[59:07] move but he's a lot older some 1980 good
[59:12] grief
[59:14] we were almost having kids
[59:16] no never mind whatever kidding this I
[59:20] got shoes as old as you boot hunting
[59:23] boots mm-hmm I did about him in 1980 I
[59:27] bought Gander Mountain had the first
[59:28] catalogue that I bought hunting boots in
[59:30] 1980 still got well Nathaniel Brenes got
[59:37] them alright so here we go
[59:42] under the fifth seal there's a few
[59:44] things that happen let's get back to
[59:46] what we were talking about cuz watch
[59:49] this that's why brother Dale said that
[59:51] to me the other day
[59:52] and it kind of struck my heart just a
[59:55] little bit right here look to me there's
[59:59] four things that happen in this fifth
[1:00:00] seal that is the Thunder because the
[1:00:05] Thunder is the voice of God when he
[1:00:06] reveals the seal to you not the time now
[1:00:08] listen let's be just let's be brutally
[1:00:10] honest a fifth seal Jew is not gonna
[1:00:14] have anything to do with your redemption
[1:00:16] in that you understand now they have
[1:00:19] something to do with the total plan of
[1:00:22] redemption but just knowing the fifth
[1:00:25] seal Jew was Jews that were not given
[1:00:28] eternal life until after they died
[1:00:29] that's not going to hurt or make your
[1:00:35] salvation any better or worse everybody
[1:00:36] got that young what I'm saying is I'm
[1:00:38] not doing away with it by no means so
[1:00:40] this is a piece of the puzzle but the
[1:00:42] Thunder under that seal
[1:00:46] you remember brother Bramson marriage
[1:00:49] and divorce was revealed in the seal
[1:00:50] where was it revealed we just got
[1:00:53] finished with it this sale Jesus Christ
[1:00:56] was married to Israel
[1:00:59] and she did what she did she what she
[1:01:02] committed fornication and remember the
[1:01:05] only way you can put your wife away even
[1:01:07] now is because of fornication you can
[1:01:09] put her away and marry again and be
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:11] so Jesus cut America Jehovah I am
[1:01:15] couldn't put him away and then for no
[1:01:19] reason he had to have a reason they went
[1:01:22] prostituting their self and then in the
[1:01:25] spiritual realm
[1:01:25] so the not even the children of
[1:01:29] Israel but Jews right
[1:01:32] they went whoring they committed
[1:01:37] spiritual adultery against God their
[1:01:39] husband and he put him away and he and
[1:01:43] he by law by his own law he can marry
[1:01:48] again so who did he take he took a
[1:01:50] Gentile bride and that was right so so
[1:01:53] the the grace of marriage and divorce to
[1:01:56] me is revealed in the fifth seal because
[1:01:58] it is great it is great because look
[1:02:02] have you ever thought about this you
[1:02:03] know and that's what we got to go back
[1:02:05] to the new birth if your old husband is
[1:02:08] still alive and you try to marry Christ
[1:02:12] you can't do that you are committing
[1:02:15] adultery but if your old husband is dead
[1:02:22] sisters if your if your husband's passed
[1:02:24] away
[1:02:25] you're just as free to marry you was a
[1:02:26] day you were a virgin well what grace
[1:02:30] but that's grace to you and me in the
[1:02:32] spiritual realm
[1:02:33] thank God don't hold that against us
[1:02:36] it's putting a sea of God's forgive one
[1:02:39] that's never to be remembered again when
[1:02:41] that old husband dies he can't remember
[1:02:43] that you are the virtuous endless proud
[1:02:47] of you how can you be a virgin and have
[1:02:50] been married before but if your old
[1:02:53] husband's dead
[1:02:55] you're just as virgin as you were when
[1:02:58] you first was born in God's eyes so the
[1:03:02] grace of marriage in divorce also what
[1:03:04] else
[1:03:05] predestination comes in view those fifth
[1:03:09] seal Jew are predestinated right it's
[1:03:14] not all jewelry no it's the ones that
[1:03:17] come in under martyrdom we read that
[1:03:21] remember like brother daily now we're
[1:03:23] talking about it's not all Jews come on
[1:03:26] get that out of your head not every Jew
[1:03:28] that died
[1:03:30] is in the fifth seal the fifth field you
[1:03:34] is a martyr someone that is killed
[1:03:36] because they are a Jew no other reason
[1:03:41] I'll read it to you in just a minute
[1:03:42] so there's predestination Daniel 70
[1:03:46] weeks to me is made more clear because
[1:03:48] of this fill this seal and then also as
[1:03:51] we were talking about the other day the
[1:03:53] total plan of redemption comes into view
[1:03:54] right here in this fifth seal but you
[1:03:59] gotta say that you gotta see not that
[1:04:02] the fifth seal Jew was was was Jews that
[1:04:04] were killed and then they got eternal
[1:04:05] life and that is grave but you got to
[1:04:08] see the things that happens to you under
[1:04:10] that seal that thunders what the voices
[1:04:13] got to speak to you that Thunder never
[1:04:16] spoke listen to me that Turner never
[1:04:18] spoke in 1963 but to one man and to be
[1:04:26] real honest with you you okay okay be
[1:04:30] real honest brother Colley this don't
[1:04:31] don't hold your heart be as old as you
[1:04:33] are
[1:04:38] sometimes you need to okay alright man
[1:04:41] don't be done all this out here man
[1:04:48] scared me for a minute I knew it gonna
[1:04:52] pick you up but I have you but the total
[1:04:55] plan of redemption has never been fully
[1:04:58] understood until this day even in 1963
[1:05:01] they listen folks they did not
[1:05:03] understand the seals you know why cuz
[1:05:08] we're still here 60 years later listen
[1:05:11] when we get a total revelation am i
[1:05:13] right we get when they open and we all
[1:05:16] come together under this revelation of
[1:05:20] all the seals being opened the Seventh
[1:05:22] Seal listen we're heading toward that I
[1:05:24] am we know he's here but that seventh
[1:05:28] seal what brings him back to her
[1:05:32] ever-present sure he never left but he's
[1:05:35] going to materialize he's not gonna be
[1:05:37] standing here but he's gone
[1:05:38] materializing you mean a man so that's
[1:05:41] what we're heading towards but when
[1:05:42] that's revealed to you we're going our
[1:05:44] body it's like it's like brother Jason
[1:05:47] was saying it's not something you gotta
[1:05:50] fight and twist and pull it's already in
[1:05:52] you the I am is there we've just got one
[1:05:55] step into that step into that moment of
[1:05:59] a body change but listen we got to have
[1:06:04] all this before we can you see that big
[1:06:07] old foundation down there called faith
[1:06:08] brother Brown said faith alone though
[1:06:12] won't do it
[1:06:15] what he said faith alone and I say faith
[1:06:20] alone is not gonna do it I believe I
[1:06:22] believe well there's a lot of people
[1:06:23] believe but what do you believe that's
[1:06:28] right you gotta believe the right thing
[1:06:31] you got to believe that what thank you
[1:06:38] listen if this isn't individual affair
[1:06:40] with God you go around all day saying I
[1:06:42] am I am I am
[1:06:47] but anyway let's look at this just for a
[1:06:49] second there by okay it kind of hot
[1:06:51] mm-hmm so now let's look here's the dang
[1:07:00] of 70 weeks just in them just in a
[1:07:03] nutshell here we were talking about this
[1:07:07] the other day I'm gonna put this right
[1:07:08] here so they had 70 years in captivity
[1:07:12] and brother Brown said that the 70 years
[1:07:15] 70 weeks of Daniel covered well we know
[1:07:20] it was seven 62 and seven that makes
[1:07:29] well one week not stable seven years one
[1:07:32] week make 70 nobody got that everybody
[1:07:37] got that
[1:07:38] that's the 70 weeks of Daniel now you
[1:07:42] and I are not in that told us the 70
[1:07:45] weeks of Daniel juice okay right so
[1:07:49] we're not in that we're not in that plan
[1:07:52] of redemption according to the 70 weeks
[1:07:56] of Daniel that's the way it's supposed
[1:07:58] to look because in the Bible I seem like
[1:08:01] this after brother Dale said that in the
[1:08:02] Daniel 70 weeks Bible are in the Bible
[1:08:05] with Daniel 9:24 there is no no mention
[1:08:09] of a break
[1:08:12] everybody okay listen there was no
[1:08:14] mention of a Gentile coming in there was
[1:08:17] no mention of a break there was mention
[1:08:19] of this being the olive tree there were
[1:08:22] seventy weeks determined sixty-two then
[1:08:25] you had Calvary now if they would have
[1:08:28] sat to them at Calvary what would happen
[1:08:30] I mean brother Dale was telling this
[1:08:32] other day now they would have now listen
[1:08:35] you can't go so far to say they would
[1:08:37] have a future home go that future home
[1:08:39] just for me and you especially for the
[1:08:42] bride of Jesus Christ but now what would
[1:08:45] they had they would have had a
[1:08:46] continuous millennium after that cuz
[1:08:50] watch after the 70 weeks of Daniel is
[1:08:52] over where are we going to millennium
[1:08:54] but they wouldn't went to the millennium
[1:08:57] and listen to this according to
[1:08:58] Scripture they never celebrated their
[1:09:01] FTS you believe they would have just had
[1:09:03] a continuous Jubilee they would have a
[1:09:07] continuous cycle for eternity wow man
[1:09:11] that opened up so much you oughta talk
[1:09:14] to you pastor something he might have
[1:09:15] you I am NOT happy if you listen but
[1:09:25] that's what would happen and we weren't
[1:09:27] included in that so there's the plan of
[1:09:30] redemption for the Jews amen but there
[1:09:36] had to be a fifth sealed you call this
[1:09:38] in the Bible there had to be 144,000
[1:09:41] call this in the Bible and there had to
[1:09:44] be a Gentile bride because that's in the
[1:09:46] Bible it just wasn't in Daniel so now
[1:09:50] with the complete plan of redemption
[1:09:51] under the showing the fifth seal shows
[1:09:54] he what he divorced Israel and we were
[1:10:03] talking about this other day he didn't
[1:10:05] divorce him back here cuz remember he
[1:10:07] kept telling him he kept what do you do
[1:10:10] they go into Mindi's and jason will mate
[1:10:12] what's covering the last things were
[1:10:13] done man they'd go into bondage right
[1:10:16] then they'd go out of bondage garcy I'm
[1:10:19] gonna put you in bondage and then they
[1:10:20] said well I'm gonna bring you out with a
[1:10:21] mighty hand I'm gonna put you back into
[1:10:23] bondage for 70 years but now after 70
[1:10:24] years I'm gonna bring you back out in
[1:10:26] and out hit it outright hidden the end
[1:10:31] in other words wipe him off but when he
[1:10:35] come to Calvary that's the only time he
[1:10:40] took his Gentile bride so he had to
[1:10:43] divorce him at Calvary he didn't divorce
[1:10:46] him back in the Old Testament he'd abort
[1:10:47] and remember Calvary was during the time
[1:10:49] of the Old Testament anyway so we are
[1:10:51] talking about the Old Testament but he
[1:10:53] didn't divorce him if he would have
[1:10:54] divorced them he didn't ever give him a
[1:10:56] chance
[1:10:57] he said you're done no he kept saying
[1:11:00] I'm gonna put you in captivity if you'll
[1:11:02] do this I'll bring you out if you keep
[1:11:03] doing this I'll bring all the way to
[1:11:05] Calvary
[1:11:05] even in Calvary's what'd he say Father
[1:11:08] forgive them they don't know what
[1:11:10] they're doing but he had when he
[1:11:13] came back on the day of pentecost yeah
[1:11:15] it was to a small group of Jews but this
[1:11:17] began that break of that wild olive tree
[1:11:21] that was seven church ages to take you
[1:11:25] and me
[1:11:26] so there we entered into the plan of
[1:11:29] redemption on the earth God knew this
[1:11:32] all in his head but he had to wait till
[1:11:35] he divorced and when they turned him
[1:11:38] down brother Brown said they made their
[1:11:40] fatal mistake at Calvary in the day of
[1:11:42] 70 weeks book they made their fatal
[1:11:44] mistake he divorced her and married
[1:11:48] listen when he come back on the day of
[1:11:50] Pentecost he married a hundred and
[1:11:52] twenty little Jesus's our little bride
[1:11:55] he and yeah sure they were Jews and
[1:11:58] there were some Jews that were saved but
[1:12:01] that's that lap over that we've been
[1:12:03] talking about he had to bring them out
[1:12:06] but what he doing in just a few years
[1:12:09] Paul said I believe God's had enough of
[1:12:13] you and I've had enough of you
[1:12:14] my brother Dale said even in the Daniel
[1:12:17] 70 weeks book brother Branham says God
[1:12:20] kept dealing with the Jews all right up
[1:12:21] to Titus when he destroyed the destroyed
[1:12:24] Jerusalem so there was your lap over
[1:12:27] there was a little lap over right in
[1:12:28] here of from AD 30 to 80 70 he still
[1:12:32] tried to deal with him he's got grace
[1:12:35] more than will ever accept but then
[1:12:39] finally Paul said lo I turned to the
[1:12:41] Gentiles I'm going after a bride not a
[1:12:46] nation individuals and who went after
[1:12:49] him Paul who's gonna go to the Gentiles
[1:12:54] that's exactly who when you wasn't saved
[1:12:58] by Paul you wasn't saved by brother
[1:13:00] Branham you were saved by the I am a man
[1:13:05] they're by all rights a man
[1:13:10] but in divorcing her right in here come
[1:13:17] a fifth seal Jew that would have not
[1:13:20] come had this not happened
[1:13:24] there's no fifth seal Jew if God just
[1:13:27] went straight right to the Jews and
[1:13:28] saved them all and took him in the
[1:13:29] rapture there would have been no me and
[1:13:32] you so now what happened
[1:13:37] you got the Old Testament Saints now
[1:13:39] look he divorced him he didn't kill him
[1:13:43] he divorced him he put him away but now
[1:13:47] you got to remember if you cover
[1:13:49] everybody like Isaiah Abraham Moses
[1:13:53] hello you cover all them and say well
[1:13:56] they were lost you're wrong there was an
[1:13:59] Old Testament people that were saved
[1:14:03] because of that happening at Calvary
[1:14:06] even though he divorced them even though
[1:14:08] they turned him down there was a group
[1:14:11] there that was in paradise a man that
[1:14:16] was in paradise waiting for Calvary
[1:14:19] because they couldn't be eradicated of
[1:14:22] sin the blood of bulls and goats covered
[1:14:27] since so God made a provision in the Old
[1:14:30] Testament to just slide them over in a
[1:14:32] little in a little place called paradise
[1:14:37] don't have to worry about the devil
[1:14:39] anymore but they couldn't go right
[1:14:43] straight up because the blood of bulls
[1:14:45] and goats listen when samuel came back
[1:14:48] up when the Witch of Endor brought
[1:14:50] Samuel up listen everybody when the
[1:14:54] Witch of Endor brought Samuel up brother
[1:14:55] Browne said that only could happen in
[1:14:57] the Old Testament under the blood of
[1:14:58] bulls it goes he said that can't happen
[1:14:59] now and then but when he brought Sam no
[1:15:03] up he looked just like he did when he
[1:15:05] died I'm gonna tell you something real
[1:15:08] plain if you die as they believer you
[1:15:11] will not ever be seen in the condition
[1:15:14] you died in amen
[1:15:19] but Samuel was so well known till the
[1:15:22] wits of endor said oh my goodness what
[1:15:24] have I done
[1:15:25] brother Brown said Samuel had on his
[1:15:27] what his mantle and he knew who Simon
[1:15:31] wasn't Samuel even said hey must have
[1:15:34] been able to get into this dimension he
[1:15:36] said hey Saul you may have a problem but
[1:15:39] you fix him to be with me tomorrow
[1:15:40] you're gonna fall in battle and in
[1:15:42] tomorrow you're gonna be with me in
[1:15:43] paradise and then so old Saul made it to
[1:15:47] old Saul was in that Old Testament Saint
[1:15:50] group which will be given eternal life
[1:15:54] part of it part of the power of
[1:15:56] redemption he's gonna save them all now
[1:16:00] listen ain't gonna say it listen when I
[1:16:01] say save them all they don't mean
[1:16:03] everybody I don't think bail is gonna be
[1:16:06] there
[1:16:07] I don't think all them real evil judges
[1:16:13] and kings from Israel are gonna be there
[1:16:15] no it's just gonna be the elect it's
[1:16:17] gonna be the ones that what in their
[1:16:19] heart God knows your heart
[1:16:21] God knows their heart God knows David's
[1:16:25] heart David David was a man after God's
[1:16:29] own heart he what he knew that if they
[1:16:32] listened if David would have been
[1:16:34] sitting here today you talking about him
[1:16:37] doing the dance when he danced when the
[1:16:40] when the tabernacle or when the Holy of
[1:16:42] Holies came back in he embarrassed his
[1:16:45] poor wife bless her heart but he danced
[1:16:48] for hours you don't think if he wasn't
[1:16:51] sitting here today with the baptism of
[1:16:53] the Holy Ghost you couldn't keep him in
[1:16:55] this building why because he saw the Ark
[1:16:59] of God now that Ark of God came in here
[1:17:02] with you today
[1:17:03] why can't you be happy
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:13] God allowed it but he never wanted to
[1:17:16] hiding those badger skins he wanted to
[1:17:18] hide in your skin here we got a plan of
[1:17:24] redemption the Old Testament
[1:17:25] you got the fifth seal Judas killed
[1:17:28] you've got the Gentile bride that's
[1:17:30] coming in here and then this right here
[1:17:33] you've still got I'm gonna write it down
[1:17:36] but you've got foolish virgin you've got
[1:17:39] cup of water in my name being good to
[1:17:41] the bride that's gonna go into eternity
[1:17:46] and they're no different from the fifth
[1:17:48] cells you almost because the fifth tells
[1:17:50] you didn't get eternal life here those
[1:17:52] people that are good to you they're not
[1:17:55] gonna get eternal life here they're
[1:17:58] gonna get eternal life there that's a
[1:18:00] watch on judgment but then you got
[1:18:02] another group you got 144,000 to finish
[1:18:05] Daniels 70 ways he has not forget to
[1:18:08] juice so there's everybody's gonna be
[1:18:15] safe that covers the whole plan of
[1:18:17] redemption Old Testament Saints okay
[1:18:22] from Adam to here 50 old you why I mean
[1:18:30] really if if fields use a mystery to me
[1:18:33] it's not anymore but it's a mystery to
[1:18:36] most people because most people even
[1:18:38] brother branham thought that fifth seal
[1:18:40] Jew being so mysterious in so given
[1:18:43] white robes he thought that was the
[1:18:45] Gentile bride because of the position
[1:18:48] they held they had white robe though
[1:18:50] they were given white robes but mother
[1:18:53] though what the mystery that opened up
[1:18:55] was that they were given eternal life
[1:18:57] after they died not even knowing Jesus
[1:19:01] Christ but no like brother now we're
[1:19:04] talking about when we come back in this
[1:19:06] millennium talk about a fifth seal Jew
[1:19:09] that's gonna follow you around talk
[1:19:12] about that man that got eternal life
[1:19:14] because they stopped and helped you on
[1:19:16] the side of the road
[1:19:18] don't even know nothing about God you're
[1:19:20] gonna walk in that Millennial temple and
[1:19:22] you're gonna say you see that that
[1:19:25] candlestick represented this that ladder
[1:19:28] represented this there's the Holy of
[1:19:30] Holies that's me cuz who's gonna anoint
[1:19:36] the temple and one more time who's gonna
[1:19:38] anoint the temple in the millennium
[1:19:41] absolutely
[1:19:42] remember we're there on the honeymoon
[1:19:45] it's not even us
[1:19:47] not for us still seven-day no way day
[1:19:50] not the future home
[1:19:52] that's future homes sitting around here
[1:19:54] today but we're scattered out sister
[1:19:59] Anna we're a city scattered but when we
[1:20:03] come into that millennium all the saints
[1:20:05] are gonna be right there together and
[1:20:07] then we're gonna just raise up off the
[1:20:10] breath of the earth and you know what
[1:20:11] that's only one man they can kill the
[1:20:14] devil and the little amps and the little
[1:20:18] junk that he puts on your shoulder that
[1:20:19] little thing that's God God will kill
[1:20:23] Souls God will take care of the devil
[1:20:26] and all those little imps of his and
[1:20:28] then you and I are gonna come right back
[1:20:30] down and John said I saw a bride coming
[1:20:34] to the city coming down as a bride
[1:20:36] adorned for a husband that's not the
[1:20:39] Millennium that's the future home the
[1:20:43] millennium is to the Jews and what a
[1:20:45] great time v sealed you heathen all even
[1:20:48] the 144,000 don't get they get the plan
[1:20:51] of redemption but they don't get the
[1:20:52] complete plan they get preached Jesus
[1:20:55] for three and a half years that's all
[1:20:56] they get and you know what I'm sure the
[1:20:59] two witnesses are probably gonna say now
[1:21:00] there was a bride that you miss but he's
[1:21:05] gonna meet us it's not gonna be here say
[1:21:10] it'll be a personal it'll be people
[1:21:14] walking in and and the two witnesses are
[1:21:17] gonna go there they are remember that
[1:21:20] big group that John saw what is it
[1:21:22] revelation is nine or someone there we
[1:21:24] saw this great big group that no man
[1:21:25] could number come walking in
[1:21:31] who's gonna come walking in thank you
[1:21:35] there by right with that say I am but
[1:21:39] that's the pleat complete plan of
[1:21:41] redemption that's God's grace because
[1:21:43] remember Israel was God's children first
[1:21:47] wife wife wife that was his wife
[1:21:53] I read you the scripture I'm married to
[1:21:56] you amen but because of grace and
[1:22:01] because the opening of the seals we can
[1:22:03] see this happen
[1:22:04] and then we can walk in the reality of
[1:22:08] it I want you to listen to this we're
[1:22:09] going to read this and then we'll close
[1:22:11] brother Joe if you would let them get
[1:22:13] back to the very last thing as of
[1:22:15] invisible union I'm gonna skip all that

[1:22:19] it again about about grace so losing
[1:22:24] brother Branham says many times talk

[1:22:35] you what a prophet prophesied of a group
[1:22:39] of people but you and I are the reality

[1:30:15] was talking about he said he said people
[1:30:17] say I don't want to join that old
[1:30:19] message Church and they're so bound and
[1:30:21] they're so you know they're just yeah
[1:30:23] just you know y'all just put under all
[1:30:25] kind of pressure and do this and don't
[1:30:28] do that he said let him get born again
[1:30:31] one time he said I told somebody said
[1:30:34] you're out there in the world and you
[1:30:35] say you're free you're doing everything
[1:30:39] the devil tells you to do you not free
[1:30:42] he said but he said when you come into
[1:30:46] Christianity he said you're still not
[1:30:48] free he saw no I've got Liberty that's
[1:30:52] difference in liberty and freedom cuz
[1:30:55] I'm not no don't let me be free Paul
[1:30:58] said I am now a prisoner of Christ if
[1:31:04] you are in love we it's like brother
[1:31:06] Jason said he said there's several
[1:31:07] billion women in this world today he
[1:31:10] said there's only one woman that I'm
[1:31:13] bound to him and that's my wife I'm not
[1:31:17] bound to no other woman but he said I
[1:31:19] love to be bound to that woman I love to
[1:31:22] be bound to that woman Jim right here
[1:31:25] [Laughter]
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:28] see what's he get for sitting up here
[1:31:30] close you get sent up here with the
[1:31:31] religious people are now that's just
[1:31:37] where the fire follows up there brother
[1:31:38] dick I know that but not really that's
[1:31:41] the way God things to you though
[1:31:42] take that really you're bound to him a
[1:31:48] love slave the Prophet even says you're
[1:31:51] a love slave to your wife if you and
[1:31:53] your wife are truly married My heavens I
[1:31:56] don't get me started on that grief it's
[1:32:00] the best thing besides Christianity you
[1:32:02] could ever have but I'm bound to her
[1:32:05] though I'm not free now I'm bound to her
[1:32:08] and you bound to Christ right who's
[1:32:13] bound to Christ
[1:32:15] hey man stand your feet god bless you
[1:32:18] but that fish feels a lot more than even
[1:32:22] I said when I started thinking about
[1:32:23] then then when I started and that's the
[1:32:26] way it should be brother Dale said he
[1:32:31] preached the seals in 79
[1:32:33] Yuri preached him in 82 he's been
[1:32:36] preaching them ever since
[1:32:37] so once God review get a real revelation
[1:32:42] of these seals open there for you it's
[1:32:44] an intimate thing between you and God
[1:32:47] it's not intimate between the
[1:32:50] denominations in the world and let me
[1:32:52] tell you this 90% of the message people
[1:32:55] all right now listen you say oh no I'm
[1:32:58] not D Christianizing nobody I didn't say
[1:33:00] there wasn't Christian I'm just saying
[1:33:02] to get the revelation of this seal to
[1:33:04] take a body change it's going to be a
[1:33:05] very very very few that's gonna make it
[1:33:10] to the body change
[1:33:18] I hope we all have a real blessed New
[1:33:21] Year I'm looking for some good things in
[1:33:25] 2019 you know how it goes with one year
[1:33:32] closer when you're closer to where to
[1:33:39] where that trumpet sounds and that
[1:33:43] trumpet says who's going and I say that
[1:33:47] was week that's better
[1:33:50] y'all not going one more time thank you
[1:33:55] I wanted to hear this behind here too
[1:33:56] sometimes sometimes sometimes musicians
[1:34:00] get involved say I am Thank You Luis
[1:34:08] that's part of worship don't you think
[1:34:14] if Abraham had a true revelation sure he
[1:34:16] knew who he's talking to
[1:34:17] but man if he to look straight into them
[1:34:20] eyes of melchizedek if he just saw Jesus
[1:34:23] Christ he'd have been a different guy
[1:34:27] but remember under blood of bulls and
[1:34:30] goats they couldn't see Jesus they knew
[1:34:34] him as Jehovah they knew him in spirit
[1:34:36] God they knew him his father it was up
[1:34:38] there somewhere but when Abraham melt
[1:34:41] that Melchizedek he said okay buddy
[1:34:44] I don't know exactly what you are but I
[1:34:48] think I'm at going in human flesh and
[1:34:52] you and I have met God in human flesh in
[1:34:54] this hour every time we go to meeting
[1:34:58] every time you come to assembly like
[1:35:00] this you're meeting God and who's here
[1:35:05] thank you pretty good what'd you say

[1:35:18] yeah put my but listen be proud of who
[1:35:23] you are the creator of all heaven and
[1:35:27] earth said who you were
[1:35:29] he can't lie you know what he can't even
[1:35:33] exaggerate because what he says
[1:35:36] we think it's exaggerated he's like it's
[1:35:39] normal it's normal
[1:35:42] listen this eternal thing he said I am
[1:35:46] it I am so it's not it's not something
[1:35:52] new to garden but he had to come down
[1:35:56] here where you can understand it because
[1:36:00] the one that created all this is inside
[1:36:02] of you if you'll just let him speak let
[1:36:07] him talk
