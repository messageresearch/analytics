[0:00] Parker will be reading that again we
[0:07] won't be reading there all right let's
[0:13] turn to Matthew chapter 16 everything
[0:24] want to thank for the ball he did a real
[0:26] good job link you guys did a good job
[0:33] with sons to where did you put the
[0:36] microphone um not there we're never
[0:47] sexy parlor excuse moi ok alrighty then
[1:03] let's go to Matthew 16 let's read verse
[1:16] let's start with verse 12 I told you we
[1:19] were going to do this told you we're
[1:23] going to do this last week and and I
[1:26] hope you I hope we understand now that
[1:29] the Son of God is a spirit god the holy
[1:34] go alright if I got them the Holy Ghost
[1:37] is the son of God that's the spirit they
[1:41] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:42] Jesus said but we're going to bring it
[1:45] down to this and then we're going to
[1:46] kind of expand a little now look why
[1:53] what's the difference in milk is a bit
[1:55] we talked about it before but let's go
[1:57] back what's the difference in the mail
[1:58] Cassidy and Jesus Christ what's the
[2:03] difference there's one key difference
[2:07] thumbs up the whole thing that's correct
[2:13] the Melchizedek was not a he was up man
[2:19] and he wasn't a son of he was the son of
[2:24] god that took on a human form not our
[2:28] brother he could not be our kinsman sure
[2:31] the kids mom was inside there but he was
[2:34] showing that he was going to come well
[2:37] brother Brown said son a man meets the
[2:40] man Abraham are inside as a as a example
[2:45] that wasn't the Son of Man right so that
[2:49] man couldn't do Abraham any good he can
[2:54] only promise I tell Abraham you're my
[2:56] you're my son and you're you know I'll
[2:58] not withhold anything from from Abraham
[3:01] enough i'm going to give you this
[3:02] promise and i'm going to visit you in
[3:04] common life but he couldn't save Abraham
[3:06] a man all right he could give him a
[3:10] promise all right that the son of man
[3:12] was coming okay but that was not a son
[3:18] of anybody
[3:20] melchizedek that flash that was standing
[3:23] in front of Abraham was the son of
[3:25] nobody so he could be a son he was a man
[3:30] he was what god that took on the form of
[3:32] a man but not God it took on the form of
[3:36] a baby man all right we have to be baby
[3:39] Potter that's right remember the Bible
[3:41] says he has no father no mother so he
[3:43] couldn't be what son he was just a man
[3:47] and I don't mean just he was Almighty
[3:49] God but that was just a human body that
[3:51] he clipped together stepped into
[3:54] actually could not do anything but tell
[3:56] Abraham what was going to happen because
[3:59] remember he said I'll visit you at the
[4:00] time of life what do you do Melchizedek
[4:02] didn't come in visiting you got it metal
[4:06] Cassidy didn't walk into 10 and make
[4:08] them change all right but the god inside
[4:13] of it did the son of god the holy ghost
[4:17] came down and anointed Abraham and
[4:19] Sarah's body and said okay this is what
[4:23] I'm going to do to you to produce the
[4:25] Sun mill Cassidy didn't do it now what
[4:27] when Jesus come he said kept saying I
[4:30] the Son of Man I'm gonna do I you and
[4:35] that's okay I don't care for preachers
[4:38] didn't do all this I me me me stuff I
[4:40] don't care a thing about people like
[4:42] that I did this and I did that not even
[4:43] it's an idea that I didn't it don't like
[4:47] that but now this guy could say that
[4:49] because he was the man he's the man that
[4:53] did all right so he can say hi cuz we're
[4:57] gonna read it right here it says whom do
[4:58] men say hi the son of man am all right
[5:02] person so what is it now this
[5:04] Melchizedek which was the one he was a
[5:06] prince he was a king son of man
[5:13] so man was a son of man down here all
[5:16] right we'll get into some of that just a
[5:19] little bit cuz brother Brown said son of
[5:22] God was a God you know he was one of the
[5:25] Creator we talked about all that the son
[5:26] of mana is all that in one human flesh
[5:29] body but that human flesh body started
[5:32] as two cells hey and sperm or German
[5:38] creation put them together to make this
[5:42] all right you don't make this there's a
[5:47] revelation if you'll get it this doesn't
[5:48] change at all there's no change in the
[5:51] Son of God he don't need Redemption he
[5:55] didn't he didn't need to get on the
[5:57] cross he's pure perfect eternal never
[6:03] had a bad day everything was just
[6:05] wonderful man but when we did what we
[6:10] did he had to come in the form of flesh
[6:14] and be born through a wound and grew up
[6:19] just like me in you that way this this
[6:22] is our kinsman ok we're going to read
[6:26] we're reading that's the man but watch
[6:28] this because most people don't get this
[6:31] but I'll prove it to you about what the
[6:33] property God said when Jesus came into
[6:35] the coast of Syria Philip I he asked his
[6:37] disciple till I told the preacher this
[6:38] one time I said look Peter never
[6:41] answered that question he said when he
[6:42] made peace and yet Peter answered the
[6:43] question I said let's read it he said
[6:47] I'll never saying like that one whom do
[6:49] men say that I the Son of Man a.m. now
[6:52] remember this is matthew 16 this is
[6:54] about it's not at the end of his
[6:57] ministry is County in the middle so
[7:00] people are already talking about him and
[7:01] and you know they're taking him a little
[7:04] strange and a lot of things went on but
[7:06] he hasn't went to Mount Transfiguration
[7:08] so he's kind of in the middle of
[7:09] ministry so whom do men say and they
[7:12] said so some of them were talking not
[7:15] they I mean they see if it says and they
[7:17] said okay that's some of the de
[7:20] something that wasn't one person that
[7:21] was today they said they said some say
[7:25] they are John the Baptist boy re carnate
[7:27] reincarnate John the better some say
[7:30] Elijah no he had all the characteristics
[7:34] of a logical level disappeared blind and
[7:36] others Jeremiah are one of the Prophet
[7:40] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[7:44] I am and Peter Simon Peter Hanson said
[7:50] thou art the Christ this is my wife
[7:54] mortal men this is not Christ full
[7:56] amount of mistake this is Christ full
[7:59] manifestation right this was the Christ
[8:01] the Creator all right he said blessed
[8:05] are their salad bar gonna know now are
[8:07] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[8:12] that's the answer he gave he'd give this
[8:15] entry and then you never say show me
[8:20] where he's at it he said thou art the
[8:22] Christ the Son of living done all right
[8:24] now we know this is the Lord Jesus
[8:26] Christ we know but look this is another
[8:28] manifestation or brother branham one to
[8:30] put it in three dispensation if we
[8:33] didn't need it we didn't need a broke
[8:35] down so we know who he is where he's at
[8:37] and what he's doing all right jesus said
[8:41] unto them blessed art thou Simon bar
[8:44] Jonah son junk we're flesh and blood and
[8:47] not revealed in you but my father which
[8:49] is in heaven which was what a revelation
[8:50] of the Son of God was watching and ice
[8:53] and aleve that thou art Peter and upon
[8:55] this rock my brother have explained that
[8:57] he said remember that's not peter
[8:59] catholic church says peter all right the
[9:03] denominational world says it's what hmm
[9:07] Jesus
[9:11] that's not a man revelation it's not
[9:14] till now Jesus was the son of man right
[9:19] Jesus was some and everybody getting
[9:20] that he's with the Son of Man upon this
[9:23] rock upon this revelation I'll build my
[9:24] church now what he build the church on
[9:26] this or this he built his church brother
[9:34] Brown City da trut he died so man heroes
[9:36] son of god and he was son of god through
[9:39] seven church ages they got the
[9:41] revelation of the holy ghost in the
[9:43] believer right so that's what Peter
[9:47] answered but jesus said okay that's all
[9:50] right that's what I'm going to build my
[9:52] church on I'm gonna build my church on
[9:55] this revelation because remember they
[9:57] didn't have a revelation of this once
[9:58] Jesus left once Jesus left it was a son
[10:03] of God dispensation right but now in the
[10:06] end time everything that they saw that
[10:09] ministry had to come back the son of man
[10:12] remember when I told you brother Brown
[10:14] said they said oh you're the son of man
[10:16] he said no I'm a son of man he didn't
[10:18] say I'm son of god they're all through
[10:19] the Ministry says I'm a son of God you
[10:21] and all her well we are all sons and
[10:23] daughters of God but watch him identify
[10:26] yourself in the Intel he didn't say on
[10:29] son of God revealing the Sun man he said
[10:31] I'm a son of man so there was God him a
[10:35] flash revealing the son of man v son of
[10:39] man what the one man Jesus Christ right
[10:41] so you put all the honor that's what I
[10:45] mean brother brown and put all the honor
[10:46] of Jesus Christ he never stood up sure
[10:48] you have to tell illustrations of what
[10:50] happened in your life I you know but
[10:52] it's not actual I always say we're going
[10:54] through the Philippine lever I thought
[10:56] Jim was going with no man the Lord is
[10:58] going to filter the door is taking me to
[11:00] fill thing
[11:01] Lord stadium in Jamaica I hardly ever
[11:03] i'll say i'm going that's a no we're
[11:05] going that's what we'll do when we said
[11:07] no lord woman ok and i'll give you the
[11:11] keys of the kingdom all right of what
[11:22] so the gods a rule of heaven the man
[11:26] ruber right so he's telling him around
[11:30] here I'll give you the keys of the
[11:31] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[11:33] bind on earth so now what's he going to
[11:36] say he's going to say look I don't go to
[11:38] the Son of God revelation is going to
[11:40] come inside of you and me being inside
[11:42] of you will read it latex Sunday for
[11:46] Jesus talked about the Son of Man the
[11:48] Son of Man the Sun man coming back
[11:49] alright whatever thou shalt loose on
[11:53] earth shall be loosed in heaven and then
[11:56] he charged his a sample they should tell
[11:57] no man that he was Jesus the Christ all
[12:02] right now let's go to let's go over one
[12:05] more Matthew 17 he's still picking this
[12:09] up this is Mount Transfiguration come
[12:15] after six days so he's continued on and
[12:16] behold there appeared unto Moses of the
[12:18] lines talking with it then answered
[12:20] Peter and sending Jesus Lord is good for
[12:22] us to be here now we'll make three cover
[12:24] dr. see if you have a son of God I mean
[12:27] son of man revelation he didn't knew
[12:28] that man with was the man but now he
[12:31] wants to build three Tabernacles one for
[12:33] you one for Moses and one for Elijah he
[12:38] said this is my beloved son and my well
[12:41] please hear you him now we know what
[12:43] that is that's the adoption right now
[12:47] let me ask you a question do you notice
[12:50] on a gun or do you dump some men who
[12:54] needs adopted son of God doesn't need
[12:56] anything remember anything make your
[12:59] list and put one thing this man's
[13:00] perfect eternal this man never felt that
[13:06] man never felt Jesus become into a
[13:08] fallen condition to get us they did fall
[13:11] through the fill
[13:12] to get back up all right that's why the
[13:15] Son of God revelation had to come in the
[13:19] church ages because they remember
[13:21] programs and god above us in the new
[13:22] test and the Old Testament God with us
[13:26] now I'm got in it okay but the
[13:30] revelation sure they were all like even
[13:32] as eco shut a man prophesied but there's
[13:34] a revelation that God is now where he's
[13:39] always wanted to be Wow why not the
[13:43] first church age then have all the work
[13:46] what out second surgery then hello Lord
[13:49] he was the word that
[13:51] three-and-a-half-year mention that son
[13:52] of man ministry was the word make
[13:54] manifest know Creed no three gods no
[13:59] eternal hell jesus never preached any
[14:02] left all right but he got he rode in and
[14:06] he knew that that's why did that even
[14:09] the ones that in the fourth church age
[14:11] that just says we believe in Jesus well
[14:14] there's like john three sixteen forgot
[14:18] so loved the world that He gave His only
[14:20] what begotten Son he was the only be God
[14:23] why'd he come from father this way he
[14:25] was a sign all right don't Lee begotten
[14:28] of the Father what and if you believe on
[14:32] him you shall be saved but if they would
[14:35] save anybody's flesh never saved no
[14:39] man's flesh this man didn't take a body
[14:42] change this man took the body chain
[14:44] these people down to the church age is
[14:46] in the Son of God revelation is what
[14:49] your own nature is cleaned out God comes
[14:52] in and you are a Christian your mind is
[14:54] changed and you have the mind of Christ
[14:56] and you're supposed to do what the Bible
[14:58] says great exploits but they come to the
[15:03] age that they supposed to die and they
[15:05] die why because there was no revelation
[15:08] that that flesh can be changed that's
[15:13] why you hear the song some glorious day
[15:16] right up in heaven you know I'll fly
[15:19] away
[15:20] you know when I die and all these things
[15:24] everybody's looking forward because of
[15:26] Revelation was under God may have a son
[15:28] remember a legend they still he's here
[15:30] that's my brother my brother I'm had to
[15:32] count say look he's here he's not
[15:34] something you go to look when he lifted
[15:39] up her eyes I saw no man say Jesus no
[15:41] Liesl a no he'll share his glory with
[15:43] nobody okay all right and they came down
[15:47] from the mountain Jesus charging saying
[15:49] tell the vision what this was a vision
[15:52] what was the division of two things
[15:57] happened on Mount of Transfiguration one
[15:59] vision was a change of the body right
[16:03] transfigured okay adoption and Moses and
[16:09] Elijah what brother Brown say spoke of
[16:12] the coming of the Lord all right the
[16:15] resurrection when the Lord comes to go
[16:18] resurrect so you have to put that in
[16:20] there Moses and Elijah well they're so
[16:23] you're looking at what tell the vision
[16:25] of no ma'am what's the vision the
[16:26] visions at the end time because where's
[16:29] Moses and Elijah going to peer in the
[16:33] end time that's the son of that's
[16:38] heading into the son of David
[16:39] dispensation because most of the life
[16:41] has got to be on the scene before they
[16:43] take Israel into the son of David
[16:45] dispensation you got that so here's
[16:48] Jesus Son of man coming up he says look
[16:51] they've told me all the way now to the
[16:54] to the Millennial most in Elijah there
[16:57] stands to two prophets not the people
[17:01] but the spirit there stands the two
[17:04] prophets that are going to go it's going
[17:06] to take him from this dispensation over
[17:09] into the Sunday to show you they told
[17:11] him all the way through
[17:12] said they told me no way that they told
[17:16] him what was going on tell the DS
[17:20] another level because look this man has
[17:21] limitations this man does not this man
[17:26] has limitation he had his sleep he was
[17:29] hungry sure there was there was many
[17:30] supernatural things that happen in his
[17:32] body I don't know how in the world he
[17:34] went 40 days and 40 nights with no water
[17:37] her food but he didn't that's what the
[17:40] Bible said so his body had to overtake
[17:43] Godhead overtake his body somewhere and
[17:46] sustain him for that 40 days but
[17:50] remember he still looked like he was 50
[17:52] something years old so that's not the
[17:55] full manifestation of this man because
[17:58] remember that man that walked in the
[18:00] cool of the day with Adam and Eve was a
[18:02] young man this man dman be theophany
[18:07] King Jesus King Jesus Christ in Theogony
[18:11] form alright but when he comes down to
[18:13] here and comes into this domain fate
[18:18] indeed the pressure pounds on this thing
[18:23] but that's what that's what went in the
[18:27] ground and he raised a son of God sure
[18:31] but he was in flesh but what flash with
[18:33] the end he was in a change flesh of
[18:34] glorified condition all right Mike's
[18:37] hotel the vision to no man until the Son
[18:39] of Man be risen again again from the
[18:46] dead now jesus knows one thing for sure
[18:48] now that he's going to die right here
[18:52] but I say that license come already and
[18:55] they knew him not what hello we know
[18:57] this is talking about brother brown that
[19:00] my gun down you ever heard that believe
[19:01] I preached it here before cup of time
[19:03] jesus answered said Elias what the
[19:05] spirit of Elijah truly shall first come
[19:08] and restore all things have John the
[19:10] Baptist did not restore all things
[19:13] right so he wasn't talking but now watch
[19:17] him watch what's God hide yourself in
[19:19] the scripture though he comes right down
[19:22] and says but I am believing the license
[19:24] come over here and they're like oh my
[19:26] lord but this is two comings of live
[19:30] intro this is the logic come in number
[19:33] three I mean number three and number
[19:35] four then I got that hmm right a lot
[19:42] truly shop first come and restore all
[19:44] things John the Baptist introduced the
[19:48] first coming of Jesus but he did not
[19:50] restore the kingdom right Jesus were
[19:54] still brought the kingdom brother
[19:56] branham restored what's he doing what's
[19:57] this right here this says right here to
[19:59] me and tie up all loose in see that and
[20:06] tight i'm not changing the word and tie
[20:10] up all loose ends that's what brother
[20:12] Brown said he came to do right the top
[20:13] all beliefs in so that allows truly
[20:16] shall come and restore all things what
[20:18] seven seals church ages everything
[20:22] brother branham problem that Ministry of
[20:24] a brother branham restored all things
[20:27] what back to who the son of man it was
[20:32] standing there so Jesus is saying watch
[20:36] this hole watch this whole part right
[20:38] here Jesus tears television to no man
[20:41] he's coming this this on television the
[20:43] novela until the Son of Man be risen
[20:45] again from the dead again so it means 2
[20:46] times right again he's going to die one
[20:50] time but remember brother Graham said
[20:52] they crucify him again but any end time
[20:56] he's going to be what resurrected from
[20:58] what dead denominations and creeds who's
[21:01] going to do it while then say described
[21:05] to the last must first come they know
[21:07] Elijah member priesthood long time ago
[21:09] they know Elijah has got to come before
[21:11] Jesus come they know that that's why
[21:14] they said that cup and that
[21:16] ere they opened the door and they say
[21:18] Elijah if you don't come then shut the
[21:20] door say until next year but one day one
[21:28] day I man is coming but Moses is coming
[21:33] winning they just missed that part but
[21:38] that spirit of Elijah will come to
[21:40] Israel and nine hundred forty-four
[21:43] thousand will then know that the massage
[21:46] coming but what they'll telomeres
[21:48] remember remember you go back then to go
[21:51] to go back into Ezekiel Jeremiah where
[21:53] it says you missed it he didn't come for
[21:56] you he's already come but don't worry
[21:59] we're here to take you out of here
[22:03] 144,000 are going to what start crying
[22:06] they know that they missed it what they
[22:09] do they miss the coming of the Son of
[22:12] Man they missed that coming but they're
[22:19] going to get what revelation the Son of
[22:21] God right
[22:26] so they're going out different that
[22:28] we're going up we're going out when the
[22:30] body change bride of Jesus Christ lease
[22:33] on a man going up because it says the
[22:36] Son of Man be risen again from the dead
[22:39] alright so here we are that whole thing
[22:42] look but I saying you did Elijah has
[22:44] come already who going about it and they
[22:47] knew him not he told him for someone a
[22:50] prelude but have done into him
[22:53] whatsoever they listed so in other words
[22:55] they did exactly what the word said is
[22:56] going to do rejecting all right likewise
[23:00] y'all although the son of man suffer a
[23:02] who them same people that persecuted
[23:05] John with the same one okay then the
[23:08] disciples understood these folks faith
[23:10] in them of what John the badness so they
[23:14] didn't say no more about it in Scripture
[23:18] nowhere except Peter says I have a more
[23:20] sure word of prophecy now because that
[23:23] man that was standing there telling us
[23:25] what was going on is now inside him
[23:27] right which was the son of God
[23:30] revelation
[23:35] so the Son of man has to be risen again
[23:37] who's going raising from the dead the
[23:40] Elijah they're looking for the Elijah
[23:43] we're looking for it's going to do it
[23:45] here the Elijah they're looking for it's
[23:48] not going to physically raised Jesus up
[23:50] but it's going to raise in a revelation
[23:52] to where the 144,000 is going to come in
[23:54] and they're going to go up and around
[23:55] right so there's your whole to me that's
[23:59] brother Adams ministry John the Baptist
[24:01] minister Jesus's ministry and the two
[24:04] witnesses right there in just a few
[24:06] scriptures boy you come by scripture
[24:07] being full building just enough just
[24:09] about three or four little purses that
[24:11] will fulfill every bit of it everyone it
[24:15] will fulfil every bit Jesus is on a
[24:17] mountain statute perfect man Jesus is on
[24:19] a mountain he gets adopted up here right
[24:25] everything is exactly the way it's
[24:27] supposed to be but likewise shall also
[24:31] the son of man suffered them now we know
[24:34] one thing's for sure that Jesus when he
[24:40] come down off of that mountain he really
[24:43] hammered on those Pharisees and
[24:46] Sadducees he really let him have it
[24:48] after them you keep reading will read it
[24:51] next honey look we're right here will
[24:52] will stop it i won't get into something
[24:55] else about the son of man but reading
[24:57] the bible just look up the word son of
[24:59] man and the new testament and see how
[25:02] many times you said the Son of man has
[25:03] power why did the Son of Man have power
[25:05] to forgive sin but let me let me hear
[25:12] yourself let me throw you a curveball he
[25:14] said you can speak against the son of
[25:16] man that'll be forgiving you right but
[25:21] if you speak against one it's coming he
[25:24] said it'll never be forgiving you here
[25:25] or anywhere else you find out what the
[25:27] difference for those normal confines he
[25:31] says son is here to forgive sad power
[25:34] but he said you've been against on
[25:36] mandy's it'll be forgiven he said if you
[25:39] don't speak against the one to come
[25:44] stop daddy about
