three months out full-time evangelist on the field so God's blessed him but he still needs his rest and he covered should pray oh one more things you Lila 19th through the 21st now we're trying to get brother Dale to go with us but brother Chris Long is having his annual meeting out there in Flagstaff Arizona actually Cottonwood Arizona and he's invited me to come and do one of the services and also so anyway yeah we'll see but brother Joel Brown and brother Darrell Ward will be there also preaching it'll be a three or four day I think it's for service three-day meeting out there so just keep us in your prayers all right there buddy good let's turn the revelations 8 let's begin today on the Seventh Seal we need we need your prayers that we can get through this this is a and I want to admonish everybody and even myself also there's a brother we were discussing on the phone the other day he said he's you know when brother Branham preached all that six seals he preached it was like some big you know like a concert like it comes to a crescendo you know it comes to a great thing you know something fixing to happen something fixing to happen something things didn't happen and then it don't happen I mean look at brother Branham on the Seventh Seal you watch him will read not today but will read some of the quotes where he's he's not fumbling around but he's not it's the greatest thing that ever happened it's a secret but he's trying to find something to say he goes back and talks about Israel and talks about the first one thing another finally begins to talk about itself but he wasn't satisfied remember he he he mates the tape the next day he's not satisfied he goes back into a motel room with brother fred sauceman if you're reading your book you'll see that brother Fred Salomon and I think of Jean Norman one of them and they retake part of the Seventh Seal he wasn't satisfied with what he preached that Sunday so and we'll get more into that but I want you to see that that this may be kind of a brother Bram talking about being a resting time or a time that's just just kind of you know even the interval that we're gonna discuss in just a minute back over again it's kind of a time of rest it's time it's kind of a time to get your brain kind of locked back into what you know what's going on so just keep us in your prayers and that's if we don't if this if this seal doesn't open we don't go in the rapture if this still doesn't open we don't take a body change all right all the other ones were good six cells finishes redemption that's wonderful and that's great and that's exactly the truth but if the seventh seal doesn't come and reveal itself then then it's all in vain I mean well sure we'll have a you know what but still do funerals and things like that and all that and one day God is gonna come but that's not it's going to happen somebody's got to come to that spot to wear that seal opens to you so revelations 8 verse 1 let's bow our heads before we get started dear Lord Jesus we pray today that you would be the one that does the speaking be the one that does the revealing because only you can do that Lord we pray that should be with us Lord give us supernatural strength for this journey and as you're setting the word those who endure to the end shall be saved so we've coming up here to the Seventh Seal the great number seven the end of all things that's come upon us Lord we pray that you would help us through this journey and and number one to never forget you live a real good Christian life Lord and then take these things and as we were talking downstairs in the Sunday School class Lord you don't want us to stay babies he wants to grow up you want us to do adult things you want us to come to a place that we are more mature that you can speak Lord to us and we will truly have the mind of Christ to be able to to speak it back out into this dark world that we're living in or we pray that you just sanctifies for the journey be with the sick Lord be with the ones that are not here the ones that are with their mothers lord thank you for all the mothers that are here Lord and the ones that have even have passed on Lord we we thank God for them as brother John was talking about Lord they they truly they truly are the cream of the crop a true mother they'll take care of the children and take care of the home take four or five boxes of anything you make a meal out of it take many different things and just to make miracles to a mother of that is Lord now I pray this should be with us Lord and let the mother of the word sink down into our heart today Lord that you will take us Lord to a higher level a higher plane someplace Lord that that she wanted man to be I truly believe it was it's the atmosphere that you had with Adam when you were in the Garden of Eden before the fall that there was an atmosphere of fellowship and and worship there between two omnipotence I pray Lord that that's what comes back to now if we're to omnipotence meet Lord we can look face to face in our creators eyes and say father and you look and say well done my son I praise that you'd just be with us now take care of us and lead us guide us in this journey bless the missionaries in the foreign fields lure brother Ernie sent us all that email yesterday showing many pictures of him being over there and just having a good time boy he looked really good with this smile and and the people smiling around him Lord they were glad to see him father just give him supernatural strength and blessed him and take care of him Lord to sanctify us in Jesus name Amen did y'all get that brother any job or just look so he looked so happy to be there so it'd been 14 years since he had been to been to the Philippines so let's just keep him in her prayers and I think he's still over there doing some doing some preaching revelations 8:1 and we need opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour now let's go to John 19 and read the scripture like we were talking last week John 19:30 says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost let's read one more Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so now we we're going to do a little something today that we may not be here very long but I want we're gonna when we get finished with with this part this is going to be the seal this is when the the seal is is 8:1 when that still opened there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour so there's like we were saying before Jesus when he said it is finished he had finished the part that he had done to that moment he wasn't finished it wasn't the end but it was the end of what he had to do in hit plan of redemption as hanging on the cross but now remember on the surface it looked like nothing was going on I mean here they put this man in a tomb and they'd put the seal in there and then they just went on the next day was their Sabbath day so they were just they were having a day of rest and it was a high Sabbath because the Passover and Sabbath came together on that day because they had to kill the lamb so the natural lamb was killed on the Saturday but the spiritual lamb was killed the day before was on the Passover evening all right and so that showed that that was Christ was the lamb the Passover lamb but when they put him in that tomb he wasn't finished as far as that goes he actually went to work he went to hell and preached to the souls that were in prison he went to paradise and emptied up paradise and brought them up with him brought up a resurrection with him and then when he come out of that tomb he didn't have to roll the stone away I mean he just didn't physically have to do it he just moved the stone out of the way of his own will and walked out and then he said all power and heaven earth been given unto me so there was the seventh seal on display the man had done his work and brother branham said one tenth of one one tenth of 100% he got way down there didn't even know Christ was on the earth at the time hey man so that's the way it's going to be now you and I are are a strange group of people we are we are not normal and some of the kids might want to say amen to that but I'm not talking about that kind of abnormal I'm talking about spiritually abnormal alright but it but you know what Jesus Christ was that way they didn't he wasn't a normal God they didn't come the way they thought he was gonna come but remember when we talked about this sealed keep some part this thing in the back of your mind that the seal the seal was very on the surface uneventful cuz listen listen when the first shell open you had one activity you had a white horse you had a bowl you had this and second seal you had a red horse that you could look at and you could see this guy riding with you know I had one of them had balances and then this one happened to this and in the fifth seal you look you see souls under the altar sixth seal you look at all my heavens the tribulations are going on in that sixth seal I mean the whole worlds in chaos so there's things going then you come up to the seventh seal that's why I said it's kind of it's not a letdown at all but it is on the surface being human beings you read that ceiling you go where do we go from here because that's hidden that seal hides everything that seal is the most powerful seal that's why I read Ephesians 4:30 and we were talking about this in the Philippines there's only one seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption all right now don't forget that word Redemption because remember when we come to this seventh seal Redemption is over but now we also got to remember that that seal see here's the whole situation we we wait we'll get to it a little bit later we wait we go one two three four five six seven and then something's gonna happen well nothing happened I mean sit here for 30 minutes and don't move and don't just don't say don't say Amen turn everything off no music of course most of you do that anyway and fall asleep but but still you may be out thirty minutes of silence wouldn't be so bad but we have you just try this but it's boring to an individual but once we see the underneath the Thunder what that seal really is it's the greatest seal that ever was to open because remember he didn't open all the way over here when the prophet of God stood out there the first day and said here stands a limb with the book in his hand there goes a white horse rider well the Seventh Seal is the lamb the lamb is the seventh seal so the seventh seal showed up on the first seal to open that first seal they couldn't open without Jesus Christ being on the scene telling the Prophet and we're going to read it next Sunday I didn't bring it with me this time but like brother Dale was talking about this morning there's two times in the seventh seal where brother Branham says this was way away from my thinking I was going on my old notes I was going to preach this right here and it was totally opposite to what I was preaching formerly because he had had his thought many times that the fifth seal Jew was the martyred Church age right the first seal he preached was the Holy Ghost and all these different things so all that was turned away from what he was thinking but to me and see that was the seventh seal working there was silence there but it was he was working in a profit he Jesus Christ and then even on the even on the questions and answers on the seals brother Branham answers a question wrong revelations five somebody asked him who is these people they say oh that's brother Branson no that's not the that I said is that the bride needs to know that's not the bride and then he goes on and he starts answering the next question and he said stop something's wrong okay stop something's wrong somebody need to be prayed for he didn't even know itself and then brother Ned I was in which was sitting behind him said read your scripture again now there were several people in that building they knew what that scripture meant but brother Branham said he said thank God for Christ being on the scene to show what he didn't want he wasn't gonna let him make any mistakes anymore seventh seal there's no mistake in it now six seal you can have these different types and shadows but the seventh seal is one person and that's Jesus Christ all right there is no imitation you show oh no no there's no imitation when that seventh seal is not Christ in the Antichrist no it's Christ it's the headstone it's that head right up there all right I mean like we were talking about in the interval the period between the two events we're talking about the the other day we'll talk about the six seals then there's a gap remember that about three or four Sundays ago there's a gap or an interval in between the two events between the sixth seal and the seventh seal between the sixth trumpet in the seventh trumpet between the six vial of seventh vial between all the churches everything there's an interval from the sixth to the seventh and it's a time of resting a pause a gap you want to pull it up and it was what I missed you gonna pull that up there there was one I missed and I'm glad the Lord showed me that because you guys see all your types because what happened with remember we even showed that who came on the scene after every in the interval there was the holy ghost coming same way with the seals what happened with the seals you got six seals then you've got revelation seven which is God the holy ghost going to to prop through two prophets to take Israel out and then the seventh seal produces itself he comes back to earth and fights for Israel and that's what the Bible says now he doesn't come back in a physical form we know that but still it talks about in Daniel it talks about the Christ coming and fighting for Israel alright so watch and then we then what does he do 144,000 people 144,000 are saved and then they're caught up then on the trumpets you've got trumpet one two three four five six then you got to get which is revelations ten one there by right there at ten one and that's the mighty angel that's Christ that's the lamb that's the Holy Ghost that's the person of God coming down the mighty angel coming down right and then we see the vials was the same way the three unclean spirits like frogs and to have the three unclean spirits like frogs there had God had to reveal what that was the Holy Ghost God revealed that that was the Trinitarian doctrine all right and then Christ and the Holy Ghost is present to reveal we see that that's what it is so now we see if we've now come to the sixth seal and we're finished with the sixth seal then God's the one that's going to have to reveal all this to us it can't be just me or brother Dale or anybody else but I missed one when we look at our types and our shadows we have to make it all fit between the sixth and seventh church age now in the Bible there's not an interval but when brother Branham comes on the scene everybody with me and he and he's talking about the church ages and then we went through it remember no messenger to the aged between the six churches in the seven churches no messenger to the aged the Holy Ghost comes himself in the fullness of the baptism so there's your another interval for the seventh seal to come on the scene there has to be the holy ghost here and not just in partial not just impartial word because look the holy ghost has been here the whole time our problem is is we just not let him work the way he wants to work that's our problem we've not let him work the way he's supposed to work because we've had these scruples and we've had these rabbit trails that we go down and we've had these things that we've had in our mind that that our tradition remember the tradition we were talking about the other day about you know Mama's walking on the streets to go with that with Jesus right now well that's not true there's not even a Bible for that but it's been told so many times down through the ages of tradition that everybody believes that same way with like brother Branham was talking I was reading it yesterday brother Branham said the Catholic Church deals with dogma now Dogma is something that the Catholic Church comes up with it's not biblical now part of it is but now remember in this 7th seal brother Brown said Satan cannot interpret this he cannot impersonate this right we'll read those quotes a little bit later on but we have been in a gap or at pause or a space or rest or a breach or an interlude like we were talking about the other day in the acts of a play now we're in I believe we're in the seventh act of this play that we're in and then the curtain when the curtain closes God's gonna take us out of here all right we're gonna be gone there's not gonna be any bride left amen but you and I are gonna have to come to a place that we've never been before that's why I read you that scripture about Joshua Joshua when they got ready to go over he said you got to leave an interval leave a space because you never went this way before we're gonna let the priest go ahead we're gonna let the word go ahead and then you're gonna follow right behind but not right up close to them because you might stumble you may stumble into something to stumble on something but you watch those priests and you watch the man with them with the ark on his back and once they get about a thousand meters and he starts walking if he makes a little this way you got to make that turn once you get there that's the same way with you and I it's really the analogy brother branham used about a prophet you know anybody and really honestly I can build a straight wall I just cannot make that corner thingy that daddy makes I can't make that well it takes a prophet it takes somebody that knows what they're doing to turn that corner of the building and it's really nothing that's the same 2x4 is it she huge going down the wall you just put them together a little bit different all right make a corner all right so that's what the Prophet did what we're trying to explain this morning thank God you know that brother branham can be you call it giving them all kind of titles but I just know one thing's for sure if it had not been for him we would not be where we're at today in the Word of God so God knew that and sent us a prophet so we would be where we are in the word today the Word of God what he preached is now living inside of us doing the work amen choice so who is it it's the Holy Ghost and then brother Branham on the seals he says Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost self same person so we're not going by three or four different people we're talking about one person and if it says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption now is that a different Christ inside of you than the one that did the redeeming how can you be redeemed you gotta become the Redeemer amen like I told you in Revelations 5 that book that God that that the lamb takes is you and if he took the book you got to be worthy or you wouldn't take the book that's not a book of the living that's not the book that's over there in the Book of Revelations it talks about the white throne judgment that's not that book that book is a book of the names of the redeemed that is the sons and daughters of Almighty God that is not just every person in the world why because they're not worthy but you and I are worthy because the way you look in these seals and if you'll look and see how that God moved up through their way even with brother branham and he said I've never worked in a realm like this before he said I've seen healings and I've seen all these things going on he said but this right here he said in other words this is the apex of my ministry and it didn't seem like nothing was going on as far as what we think is going to go on you know as far as the healings and the signs and the wonders and many different things if you'll notice even when he had a when he had the prayer line in the six the questions and answers on the seals it was just they come through the line and he said receive your healing in the name of Jesus receive your healing it was just a it was just a normal prayer line it wasn't very much supernatural going on he didn't call many people out I don't think you called anybody out so you see what I mean it's coming to a place to where wait saying brother way all right you got to have a personal experience yourself you got to know that you know that you know now that I know that brother mark knows not that I know the brother Dale knows you got to know that you know that you know that that seventh seal has been revealed to you you personally it started as a personal relationship and it's got an end as a personal relationship hey man so you and I have got to come to a place but we have to go through that little journey called Redemption because to redeem there is things you have to do remember what did what did Boaz have to do Boaz a type of Christ what did he have to do he had to not only take the shoe off he had to go to the near kinsman say hey are you gonna do this we know that what the story is that's type of the devil he had to go to the devil first right he had to go to the near kinsman and he said yeah I'll do it and then Boaz god almighty just he just turns this thing around on the devil and he says okay said you got to have a baby with her and you got to raise the fat baby in your name he said whoa well you go ahead because he's Satan don't want to Mar his name that's what st. don't want amar that beautiful name that he's got I'll take Christian any day but so bo laughs what do you do though to do to do the right of redemption though he and just say okay over with no he had to go stand out in a public place you see what I'm talking about their scenes here he had to go out in a public place you had to take his shoe off and he had to hand it to somebody I don't remember who it was but he hadn't had it and say I read to him everything that neoman has lost then in redeeming everything that Naomi had lost he gets Ruth and then of course we know the story they have a child and they give the child back to the mother and a perfect type of us giving the message back to Israel when the baby is born we take the baby back to Naomi and say here's Jesus Christ and that's what goes to through the 144,000 all right so let's read just a couple of quotes here and then we'll I kind of figured we would be on be on resting mode today so I got us a little something we're gonna look at about the number seven because we're number seven is you say some good things in there alright let's look at the first quote let me read this again cuz I want you to see now we come to the seventh seal and we say oh well the seventh seal something different no it's still the plan of redemption it is the ending it is the total it is the total summation of from when Adam fell in the Garden of Eden to today all right now our kinsman has handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner this just revelations five it's what he's talking about Revelation chapter 5 when we lost it in the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poster on the land a squatter that Satan he came over he's a poacher and now remember he's the one that's riding through the church ages he's one that's missing all this up this earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squadron man how I could say something right now but I better not is the title deed of our Redemption this seventh seal book he's not asking a question he's telling us the title deed the redemption is this seventh seal book it's the title deed you wait till we get into the seals he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people all right so the seventh seal has two be the lamb God Almighty Christ Jesus Christ it came down and paid the price he's the one that breaks the seal because remember the lamb breaks the seal not the Father we know it's the same person but we got a position we got to look at the the father is on the throne and gives the book or actually the lamb takes the book and the lamb breaks the seal that's why it's a book of redemption the lamb is always the redemption it's the system it's the sacrifice he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people now what did he inherit while he was here on earth he inherited eternal life in his body he didn't need eternal life in the soil didn't eternal life in his spirit he needed eternal life in his body and that's the inheritance that he received by breaking the seals now listen breaking the seals means that you got something to do with him he didn't just break it and throw the book away no he broke it open the book and says here comes Regina here comes sister Peggy here comes sister Charlotte here comes sister brother he opened the book to reveal you to reveal you not him we know who he is he's been written all down through the Bible but he's the Muslim misunderstood person there is in the Bible so are you going to be any different no they're not gonna they're gonna be same way with you they're not gonna understand who you are I've told you many times that one mystery in Revelation is 10 7 is you the mystery of God should be finished amen he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people all right so you and I are recipients of this that's his love for us see Satan wouldn't have that kind of love if you gave Satan eternal life he had been built he'd be the most selfish person in the world that's just his attitude all right let's read number 2 the breach now when we go to break these seals you're going to see it goes plumb back in the scriptures all the way back now listen what he's saying and when we go to breaking these seals you're going to see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals in the seals cannot be broken until that time I'll prove it here in just a minute notice now the book remember is sealed here's one here's this seal then another one remember this is what he's doing he's twisting it up like this because remember it's not in a book form it's in a scroll form all right another one wrapped the seal it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and being us on the backside is because just wound up the seal mystery is on the inside he's just telling you right there the sealed mysteries on the inside this is the seal mystery that the seal the seal sure that was number one mystery that the seal part was but once it was tore off you don't have to rehash listen once brother Graham preached that the wild horse rider was Antichrist I believe most people was like well we should have seen that because of the way it presents itself now we don't have to go back and rehash that it's broke but now what's inside of it we do over and over and over again we have to go to church we have to read their Bible and we have to see that the part that we didn't see that now we can see is that seventh sealed book of redemption it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals being on the backside still just wound up the sealed mysteries on the inside now where's your mystery where's your mystery your mysteries on the inside because you know what I see you just like I did 20 years ago years ago 50 years ago well most we had more hair than that and it was darker but anyway but now well what I'm saying is we all change but we're not changed in so we got changed one time inside and that's the mystery is that gods inside they're doing the work and we're getting older and older and older and really over a lot older really old earth that's a mystery the seals the mystery seals on the ant mysteries on the inside and it only says white horse rider black horse rider what more on the outside see but the mystery of the whole book is in them fields from Genesis to revelations a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals oh it's the important time now look we've read the quote many many times that six seals finishes Redemption now he's telling us that seven seals has two holds the whole plan of redemption they're bad news everybody with me everybody with me we know six seals finishes redemption because there's nothing seven seals just a silence in heaven so that ought to prove to you that number seven had to be at number one had to be at number two had to be at number three had to be four had to be five had to be at number six the seventh seal had to be on the scene revealing all these other seals then when you get to number seven he's going to give you that inheritance that he inherited which is what eternal life in your body well it was don't excited son but I guess it doesn't stop son all right number three it is the rising of the Sun well actually number yeah look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals now look we think like brother Dale saying this morning that's thinking about it while he's freezing you go back to your old idea that you gotta have an emotion you got to have a cry you got to have a cloud or a you got to have a guy have a wallet if the quickening power came and opened the seals during that week brother branham said that was the greatest week he'd ever been in they didn't many people get healed they went no they wasn't a great shining light come down in the tabernacle you understand what I'm saying then you get on the Seventh Seal and he acts like you don't know what he really don't know where to go how to go what's going on we're gonna take this right now this is all we got to go on but the quickening power was the Seventh Seal that would not let brother Branham make a mistake no more mistakes the whole week God was orchestrating that whole week worth of services and he was there doing the work but he was doing it for me and you so the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals because remember look it's not how many people let me try to get this right brother Ram didn't have to heal 850 people raised 14 from the dead you understand he didn't have to get a resume he didn't have to get a resume so that God could speak to him so he could open the seals no he came to a position in the Word of God he came to a position in the Word of God now we all that other is extra stuff that's manifestations around signs follow the believer but what happened was God was opening the word up to the Prophet and here he was and all these things going on but look the quickening power what was it the intelligence of a man know the quickening power of God that he could stand on that platform and know that he could not make a mistake from there to the time he left he could not make a mistake God wented all of our ignorance but they've come a time now to where look Jesus Christ never made a mistake never made a mistake we only have three and a half years remember the silent years we don't know anything about much but that three and a half year message that man walked in human flesh and never made one mistake now you say well he yeah he might have got lost one day and when he was a kid you know you understand what I mean when he spoke it was God speaking that was the seventh seal producing itself because when he spoke things happen all right same thing with you and I what was it the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold this would take place see the quickening power of God made the world testify to it he's talking about the angel down in Arizona it's the truth the angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar fire now there's nobody brother Ram told him on the seventh ceiling on the sixth Hill he said there's something going on this whole week and said I was hoping somebody wouldn't would figure it out or would come and nobody did there's something going on all week what the angel of God the pillar of fire was in that building every single service and nobody saw it that's what he said I'm to see the quickening power God made the whole world testifying that's out in Arizona the angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew just look this away and it's our Lord up there you see he's talking about turning just like that he's he's showing it right there he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals so if he's the seventh seal then he's the first one second one third of them four of them fit to encephalon because no one brother branham could not open those seals he tried he preached them before he he went through many many times preached him several times preached one series on and preached to all 71 one service but he never saw this part until when he got to that he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened I thought it was the Antichrist and I thought it was the air tell this in the Anti Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of seals then revealing Christ's glory now let's take the scripture Christ in you the hope of glory that's what I said folks these seals we've put them there in a book form we've listened to tape but what's on this page right here does us no good but if we become what that is if you become what that is then you're a walking seal yourself that's why I read the scripture grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are seven sealed because you're sealed with those seven seals you are the seal that's what I'm trying to get you to see but I just think getting anywhere you don't think about taking ice cream or something on them number four will turn down to the eighth chapter or the one first verse I mean of the eighth chapter revelations eight I know you're tired now just try to listen for a few minutes and God of heaven help us is my prayer now here he's reading it we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things I'm gonna read this and then we'll break it down later I just want to tell you what the seal is but watch what this is we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seven sealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world it is the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything and there is the end of the trumpets because remember all trumpets sound on the sixth seal right that's the end of the vowels go see what he's talking about we're fixing handed in the Millennium seven seals got to be on the only earth to get us out of here so that we can make it to the Millennium okay all right it's the end of everything comes remember look seven is still in time redemption happens in time redemption cannot happen in eternity redemption has to happen in time that's why the moon it's not a seven it's an a we're still under the Seventh Seal in the millennium color still in time that's Redemption still going on listen redemption happens all the way up to the white throne judgment the man and there is the end of everything and there's the end of the trumpets into the vials into the earth it's even the end of time time runs out the Bible says immense revelations 10 chapter 1 through 7 time runs out the angel said time will be no more when what in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of the EV the at the end of this seventh seal notice it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials even ends the ushering in of the Millennium right because remember that seventh seal is going to come back into the Millennium with a bride to rule and reign on the earth for a thousand years in time in read em still in Redemption that's on the seventh seal everybody got that say man alright so now let's read number five this is what we're going to call this seal in just a minute brother branham named it and it's the meaning of canyon he said this is the third Pole and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today we're gonna get into all that later because of the sixth seal open in three parts the seventh seal opened in three parts everybody got that all right cuz three is perfection but we're gonna get into this number seven in a minute the other one unfolded today and there's one that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but I was standing right there and looked right straight at it this is the third pole coming up now what is the third pole the opening of the word you can say it's this day or the other but it's the opening of the word this is the third pole coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent oh my just shows it's from God I see what he's telling he sound this is it wasn't it his other eleven hundred and fifty something sermons wasn't from God but this is what's his job this was what he was sent to do this was his job revelation 10 7 - take this and open these mysteries of these seven seals all right it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the message you notice now now notice now for the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal that's what the Seventh Seal is it's the end time seal no one else has had to deal with the seal like you and I are dealing with them now no one has had to produce Christ in human flesh like we're gonna have to all right but they don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible so see now everybody's going to put they put a it's on this it's on this it's on this what do you say it will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible listen folks we're going to leave this world and nobody's gonna know we're going this whole world you know what this world's just gonna keep on going this ain't this is not like the movie was left behind everybody see everybody knows that was left behind I mean you know what they have the first scene you know in cars are all banging together and airplanes are falling out of the sky because everybody's going into rapture oh yes all but pieces of them all the parts of them but yes it's not it's gonna be a total secret even though even the resurrection is going to be a total secret we're the only ones that's going to know what's going on there's your seal is that it's sealed to the world but open to you hey man it your you're sealed up as an individual you're sealed until the day of your Redemption all right so this is now the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible it says at the end of the seventh angels message all the mysteries will be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal so so you see what I'm saying the seventh seal is not some event brother Ram could just step out and say all right this is what it is he didn't show me read the whole Seventh Seal book he never said this is what it is there's a few times in there that we're gonna deal with that brother branham said it's not open it's not revealed itself yet he says right here if it's the endtime seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible thereby okay with that amen it will be a total secret and it says it's opened in a three-fold manner and he spoke of a fold of it so we're gonna get into all that later I just wanted you to see what to see was this seal is probably the most uneventful seal in all the seal series because number one everybody's you can draw you know horses and hey look we can take that my book my thing up here you can put horse one two three four five once it's before then five and six and you can draw all these things but what would be on this board if I read what the double seal was it'd be empty it'd be empty there'd be nothing to go on except a redemption of Israel and that's not our seventh seal that's not what we need to be talking about we got to get out of here before he can go to Israel but that board would be completely blank but you know as that board is completely blank you're sitting here today with a life that you've lived in God forever how many years it doesn't matter if it's one or fifty and you have a story to tell you have a story to tell but you know what I can't write it on that board you're gonna have to come up here and write it on that board you're gonna have to come up here and ride it on this board I can't ride it so for you you're gonna have to ride it for yourself maybe that'll help you in a little while we'll understand something about this that my seal so now as I was sitting yesterday thinking about some things I thought you know what there's all kind of numerology in the Bible so I just started looking up the number seven so let's see what brother Brown says about the number seven and then we'll look at it some of you can pull it up online but I got it over there for you I'm gonna hand it out you know reason I didn't hand it out to you a few minutes ago or an hour ago because you'd be sitting there reading it and you wouldn't be listen to what I was saying so anyway I probably should to give it out so you kept you awake alright let's read these quotes from brother Branham we know brother Brown said the seventh that number seven is what number seven is completely say hello won't y'all be in the message how long y'all be in the message seven is the number of completion okay okay now watch pull this one up let's just see how significant this number seven is let's just go to the first one right here watch this is what I was telling you about this morning cuz we were reading downstairs for brother Brown was talking about and I have also said about laying on of hands we should get away from that Paul says we should get away from it let's read this round here mister organ Brian said to me that number seven was already healed while I was preaching Oh huh number seven was he's calling a Prayer Line you know that's kind of strange that that bit that that audio you were listening to a few minutes ago was a prayer line I didn't orchestrate that God did brother Branham was calling numbers for a prayer line that's what he's doing around here I just cut it off because he was calling one two three four five six and brother organ Brite turns and says number seven says they've already been healed was already healed while I was preaching praise the Lord that's good that's the original way I wish Tommy Osborne if he had to come tonight that's his way of doing it Lord taught me augs Bert's doing it and we're not preaching the word and that's the way to do it preaching the word and to get healed by preaching God sent His Word and what did it do heal them that's right that's good all right so look and it's kind of strange it was number seven I don't think it was very strange but I think that's I'm just telling you what brother Branham said already healed while I was preaching now what a great thing brother Branham you know what would have thrilled him more than anything if he'd said okay number five oh you've already been healed number six oh you've already been healed number seven oh you weren't number eight you've already been healed that was what he was looking for not having the hands laid on all right now look go to the very next quote seven God's perfect number so now seven is God's perfect numbers everybody got that say ma'am alright just right down the road one two three four five six seven now let's go to the number light number these let's go to countdown now ten is a bad number but man always counts backwards next on my countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero why does God do he starts with his number 7 that's God's number watch him 7 he counts ahead starting with 1 he starts with his first church change all right so 7 is God's numbers everybody got that same n next 1 10 virgins in 144,000 another church has 7 Church ages and that's the complete number of the church age that's all 7 7 is God's completed number all right completion we're gonna look at some things that we're going to look at this commentary here in just a second but 7 it's God's completed number there's only 50 of these so don't give one to every kid take one and pass it back just give it to the adults and those of you that can read and that may not be the self-same you hand me back I can do all that but this we're going to look at what man has come up and it's really good while you're passing them out I just put in the number what is the number seven mean it's the most prominent number in the Bible it is the most prominent number in the Bible now so this first one they're gonna be hard to reach for some of you older ones but just wit is what it is oh I hate that statement everybody got it I'll help these I'll help them out no I don't want this no I want these I don't want one thank you okay let's don't get confused here spinning all right everybody got one you got everybody got one okay on a minute okay y'all share help Boyd read but won't give them one back there anybody else need one I got some more we got some more everybody got one Kendrick you just watch you want one of your own talking you don't you let your mom Gilbert close to her all right we're gonna have just this is just gonna be this we're gonna coach for about 20 minutes watch you this is but this is neatly butan have you ever looked up the number seven we're in the seventh sale this is number seven seven seven is the most prominent also most important number in the Bible now this guy said it's used 465 times if you count other variations that 654 now they some other people come up with other ones look at the first one seven days of creation God said anyone who killed Cain would have been just owning Sevenfold inna was the seventh from Adam he was taken to heaven without dying hmm God commanded that nought eight seven clean animals and 72 Birds the flood began seven days after Noah was in the ark the rainbow has how many colors seven God's covenant with Abraham had seven blessings that's Genesis 12 if you want to read those jacob agreed to work seven years for leah seven years for Rachel and then he worked seven more years he loved him women a lot when Jacob went to meet his brother he saw he about seven times Pharaoh had a dream and Joseph interpreted God gave him seven years of plenty and seven years of famine a Hebrew slave was had to only work six years and was released in the seventh year the firstborn of all cattle were given to God but not until they had been with their mother for seven days God commanded the Israelites to give their land they Sabbath everyone seven years the golden lampstand are the menorah had white seven lamps all right then you can keep reading on down through there after having a male child a woman was unclean for seven days Aaron and his sons were consecrated for seven days the day of atonement held on the seventh month you know what seventh month is that would be October okay everybody got them seventh months not July seventh month in the Jewish calendar is October because their first month is April which you say March April all right everybody got that it took seven years for Solomon to build his temple Samson had seven locks of hair when he lied you're eight prayed for rain the servants went to look for rain seven times the rain came after the seventh time the shunammite woman's son sneezed seven times after Lysa raised him from the dead just keep going naman had to wash what seven times the tribulation will last seven years when he'd instruct that one out proverbs mentions seven things that are abomination to God there are seven things that Jesus said one on the cross jesus healed seven times on the Sabbath Jesus fed 4000 men down at the bottom of the page with seven loaves of bread and a few fishes and after everyone ate there was seven baskets full left over Jesus said to forgive seventy times seven Mary Magdalene had seven demons and it was made seven years when her husband died finally the Book of Revelations contains the most use of the number seven in the New Testament 53 times in here let's read them right here churches there were seven churches seven spirits seven golden candlesticks seven stars seven lamps you know what the world this guy right here the world does not know the significance of this but we do we know exactly who them churches are we know exactly who those seven spirits are we know exactly what the candlesticks mean we know what the Stars are that the messengers and we've even got their name Paul Iranians Martin club of Luther Wesley brother Brett right this man doesn't he's just telling you they're seven in the Bible and what I'm telling you is since you're the mystery you're looking at these sevens going I know what that is I know what that type is have you not been doing that if you've not been doing that you didn't go back read again if you've not done it go back and read again said man I know what that types I remember what brother Brahm said about this I remember this I remember this see folks that's the seal that you're sealed with you're sealed with this message knowing all these mysteries and it's coming from your brain oh yeah somebody's got to stand up here and spark your memory but look there's seven seals seven horns seven eyes we know Brooke we know exactly what that is the horns in the eyes angels trumpets thunders seven heads seven Crown's seven plagues seven vials seven mountains we know who's sitting on that one and seven kings let's go to the next one meaning of the number seven it's used 735 times 54 times the book of Revelation alone the number seven is the foundation of God's Word if we include the one where it says Sevenfold and seventh its 860 references to the number seven all right seven is the number of completeness and perfection have you ever thought about this look at me seven is what four plus three the number of redemption and the number of perfection add it together make seven anyway seven is the number of completeness and perfection both physical and spiritual it derives much of its meaning from being tied directly to God's creation of all things and look look at this you read a little bit further the Bible as a whole was originally divided into seven divisions law prophets writings or some the Gospels in acts the general epistle the Epistle of Paul and the book of revelations the total number of original inspired books was 49 or seven times seven demonstrating the absolute perfection of God's Word I just keep on going then I'm just giving over this so we'll take up so much time we can go home in the book of Hebrews written by the Apostle Paul he uses seven titles to refer to Christ heir of all things captain of our salvation apostle author of salvation for runner high priest and the author and finisher of our faith pretty neat huh in Matthew 2:13 Jesus is quoted as giving 7 parables 7 psalms are ascribed to David in the New Testament in the Book of Revelations there are 7 church age of seven seals he goes over the scene same thing but look this huh how about the number 7 with God's annual feast days how many feast days are they seven there's not eight six five four there's seven seven feast days beginning with Passover now what does the seventh feast days do the seven feast days are the redemption of Israel those seven feast days takes them from what all the way to atone through atonement right into what Tabernacles it's taking them type Redemption their seven annual holy days beginning with Passover and ending with the last great day you know that's what that last that last number seven is called the last great day that's what we're in the last great day the cycle of the holy days is completed in three festival sessions seasons by the seventh month of the sacred calendar which is october bob was on this the other day Passover and unleavened bread the first month Pentecost the third month trumpets and atonement Tabernacles and last day is in the seventh month all right now Jesus performed all those miracles well I wanted to go get old over here and look at this this woman's got the big writing so all of you can read this this guy's not a Christian he's some kind of methodologist or something so he brings a little different view but I want you to read this but he starts off with the Bible seven appears fifty-four times within Revelations the final book of the Bible but the ground told us 7:30 finally that's the same way as the other ones an example of this would be God resting on the seventh day after creating everything within the universe as we explore the Bible there were seven main sections the law the prophets we've read that before gospel journal pistol epistle Paul finally the book revelation the Apostle John gave Jesus seven titles and Jesus himself gave seven parables in Matthew 13 and perform seven miracles on the Sabbath day keep going on down a little bit further the reference to seven don't stop there there are seven holy days and of course there's no there's no forgetting the seven deadly sins this one's interesting the Star of David we call it the six point Star of David but in their tradition it's a six point Star of David but there is a center court that represents the spiritual dimension we're what somebody talking about an air core this morning okay alright so the star contains seven areas within itself some Kabbalah strap long strands of red string around the tomb of Rachel seven times before cutting it into bracelets for protection other faiths in the meaning of number seven the number seven meaning is it limits Li limited solely to the Bible for example if you take a look at Buddhism as the mother of Buddha died seven days after giving birth to her son there was also seven factors of the enlightenment and seven universal mental constant constituents within the Baha'i faith which originated and Iran is most puffery within the Middle East there are the Seven Valleys which are the seven spirits of development that one must travel through in order to reach God keep turning it over if we set separate faiths this one's neat I like this one if we separate faith in history for a moment we can find burying references to this number throughout the world for starters there are seven seas there are seven continents there are seven wonders of the world there are seven nobles will execute it in the tower green green and Tyrell I don't even know what it is but if there are seven numbers there's only seven numbers that Brett takes up the whole Roman numeral see it IV xlc DM that constitutes the whole what the end of the Roman numeral and there's also seven notes in the diatonic scale everybody know what dr. Scalea say man I didn't think you'd say Amen with somebody wait a minute who studied who studied it's the notes the diatonic scales the notes look reed FC g da e and b there's only seven notes now there's variations and I read up on this there are five whole tones or steps and there are two half steps ah about that happy Oh daddy pretty smart I knew Richard would know that of course it's not just the past that seven makes and the parents look I want you to see this so what the seven mean turned over within science mail them well the meteorological phenomenon whereby light is reflected refracted and dispersed through droplets of water also known as a rainbow that's the scientific thing that's just not just God just didn't throw that up there that's scientific create seven colors red orange yellow green blue purple and paint seven is also now this is interesting seven is also the primary number within Miller's law and then Miller was a psychologist which is an idea proposed by psychologist George Miller related to the idea that our working memory on average can hold seven plus or minus objects the original telephone number was only seven note seven digits that's why it was seven digits I looked that up again I googled it because that you didn't use area codes then you didn't have to y'all have so many older ones remember you just really just dialed the last four numbers one time right well then you had to start dialing six seven seven four six nine one why because your brain can remember up to seven items at a time hmm hmm there are seven celestial beings that are visible in space with the naked eye Mars Venus Mercury Venus Mars Venus Mercury Venus how do you do that Saturn and Sun in the moon so what does the number seven mean arguably it could be the number of power which is why appears so many times throughout history however it is also possible that number seven has significance due to how often it is mentioned within religious texts symbol of completion and perfection in every tradition angel number seven refers to the whole planetary order the whole celestial dwelling and the whole spiritual energy you know how many dimensions are there hmm Wow all right look at this this is what mm-hmm this is what he does obtaining when add adding three a celestial symbol of Trinity which we know that's not true but we know three is what brother Graham said three is what perfection God is perfected in Father Son Holy Ghost he's not he's not divided okay and then the four cardinal points are terrestrial material materiality which is what our Redemption the number seven is also the symbol of the union between the sky and the earth consequently it is omnipresent in your life there are seven days in a week there are seven colors in there seven numbers in the night on a scale there are seven seer centers of energy and yoga there are seven planets and traditional astrology and also one I want to give you there are seven cycles there are seven year cycles in your life that's how important it seven is you look right these numbers that well just look when you turn seven think about things that happen the next one's 14 now think about this change in your life 21 28 35 42 I've lost a lot of you there 49 56 I'm getting close mine's gonna be in sick at 63 so 63 there's 56 63 70 77 dad's missed his by two years mama this is yours you'd be 77 huh whoa this would be mom's mom 7 7 7 7 goodness and 84 but there are servants there are seven-year cycles in your life so that's number 7 the reason I read all this is to give you an idea that that's why God that's why there's seven seals closest the number 7 is important the 7 number 7 is completion and it also refers if you'll keep reading to the heavens there are 7 heavens where the Angelica order resides and where the Archangels are Prince's there are seven is the embodiment of divine perfection isn't the world was created in seven days now this one right here we're going to end on this now we know that number seven is always considered a lucky number in the world you know you hit the jackpot seven seven seven right okay but now watch this when taking a closer look the number seven quickly becomes initiation number a mysterious number here's an example and there is a couple of examples of math that's some kind of a primary number that you can't I didn't get in left here's an example each lunar cycle that ladies we know what that 28-day cycle is but we know the moon cycle is also it every 28 days the moon goes from full to dark but did you know they were if that was four sevens four sevens is 28 now to become initiated and open the door to the mystery add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 and plus 7 you get 28 when you add one two three four five six seven together to each other you get 28 strange huh that's what the guy said strength no it's not strange that number seven is a perfect number and it but you know you say it's an odd number because it's seven you know it's seven but seven is our whole life was evolved around seven you got seven days in a week the reason we come to church today because it's the first day of the week yesterday was the seventh all the Seventh day Adventists went to church that day but the Seventh Seal then is what it's very important that number seven is completeness and perfection together it is intertwined with the number three and the number four as we were looking at the four horse riders and we were looking at what lion ox man and eagle we're looking at redemption and perfection so we're going to be perfected that number seven is going to give us a lot of meaning let's stand to our feet as we go further I just want you to see what just and you might have some other things you can look online at with just a few things I picked up last night about the number seven God loves the number seven so we should love the number seven but now remember we as Christians we passed that we live in an eight but we're in a seven we're in this cycles of seven sevens and sevens and sevens but we are in the eighth day spiritually we're in the eighth day spiritually but we it takes those seven seals it takes those seals to put us in the future home which is the eighth day all the other all the other y'all gonna come play yeah musicians come musicians come on for the seventh time Lord bless you maybe that will help you a little bit you think about the number seven for next Sunday and we'll well we saw the seal the seal is there silence in heaven there's nothing the blackboard is totally or the whiteboard is totally empty there's nothing there there's silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour brother Brown said that's not so bad when you're doing something he said but when you can't move he said not an angel twitched nobody moved everything was silent we'll read some of that next Sunday but remember to be silent to the world is to not be silent with God you know they ask don't they ask you so what are you gonna do say to now well you know people in the world yo your buddies are gonna go well we're gonna go over I'm gonna try to name chop we're gonna go to chop and have a few beers and then we're gonna go over there and we're gonna you know they give you a list of all these things to do that and don't even interest you at all but that's their normal that's their normality and then they look at you you go what are you gonna do I think I'm gonna go home read the Bible you go get one go home and read the Bible oh man I read the Bible in the morning we can go have a beer in the afternoon you know but that's the way the world is but our silence to them but you know remember the old saying silence is deadly this silence is deadly cuz this either going to put you in or put you out this silence in heaven for the space of half an hour it's a wonderful thing sing a song [Music] God is so good ah [Music] hey snow [Applause] [Music] Jamie garnish they saved your soul he will give you the greatest thing that ever hit the faceless hurt the message of the hour he saw means if I sing it I love him I love him [Music] he's so good [Music] me then again I tony levin west [Music] I love him [Music] he's so Oh [Music] is my friend Oh is my friend Hey is my friend [Applause] [Music] turn let's say you like this he heals my sin [Music] my sin oh he healed you Danny did he heal you from your sin - wiped and completely away that's why love them so listen we can't love them without having healing [Music] here so do amen - good - you even you know we just try to live we just try to love him a little bit I mean but if you've got the agape love inside of me that's what loves God all this other is its filial love you know you loved it - this you love your wife and you love your mother and you love your different things but that's not like God's love that's why brother Branham said a million times a million times a million I think even put billions in there when he went across that curtain of time he said you think about perfect love he said that ain t my drop in the bucket what we have here - what we have what they had over there and it's inside of you today it's inside you today that Christ that we're talking about the whole world sees religion but they won't see it like they see it in us they'll never see it guys folks brothers sisters they will not see it because they're not meant to see it there's only a special group of people is gonna see this message that's not just being brother branham's message no this is my message he delivered it to us and then he left Moses delivered it to Joshua and he left God delivered it to us and he left but remember he didn't leave he came right back and went inside of you so that we can understand this message not the print not the print the live message that to me that's what that Seventh Seal is gonna do it's gonna take us from looking at events God just took all the events away silence in heaven nothing moved no event but it's the greatest event that ever was in the world is that God's dealing with you and the guy sitting beside of you probably don't even have anything know anything you know Bob sitting down there in that cubicle with all those lawyers and stuff around him and they're doing their thing and and the little Bob's just in a he's just in a little cocoon you know thinking about God and thinking about the prophet message and thinking about scripture and God's talking to him and all hell's breaking loose around him but silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour Oh God [Music] God is here's so good to say no more time as you're dismissed oh god is Sagar see you back on Wednesday night here so [Music] he song [Music]
