[0:33] Heavenly Father wherever gracious Lord
[0:36] and thankful Lord all that you are doing
[0:38] for us Lord ways may seem difficult and
[0:42] hard sometimes but let us believe and
[0:44] know that you're always near God for you
[0:46] have promised that by Your Word Lord we
[0:49] already healed Lord and we ask that we
[0:52] will just accept the manifestation god
[0:55] of what you have promised Lord what you
[0:57] have given Lord let us never doubt but
[1:00] always believe that you are real in
[1:02] every promise that you made God you'll
[1:04] fulfilled Lord and we thank you for it

[4:01] with us say to her welcome she's been
[4:04] here before so she's not a visitor she's
[4:07] been with us before and we pray that the
[4:10] Lord would bless her and take care of
[4:12] her everything you know that have
[4:13] brother Tim Calhoun he's somewhere I
[4:17] guess back in the back or something
[4:18] we're glad to have him with us and we
[4:21] just pray the Lord would bless him take
[4:22] care of him he's going to be traveling
[4:23] on I think after the service home and
[4:26] also pray the Lord are blessed brother
[4:28] Gary said for me to specially say thanks
[4:31] to everybody Brother Gary Atkins for
[4:34] your prayers your concern your calls
[4:38] your your cards and the things you sent
[4:40] to him and he said I don't want to be to
[4:43] the bases that I can't come to church
[4:45] but said I don't want no bugs and things
[4:49] right now you know he's on the mend he's
[4:52] coming upward and it's like I told him
[4:54] one day there I said Brother Gary this
[4:55] is going to be one day at a time time
[4:57] well one of these days you know we'll
[5:00] see one day at a time means you just
[5:03] keep moving on you know you keep moving
[5:07] on and it'll gradually climb higher and
[5:09] higher and he's doing a whole lot better
[5:11] you can understand his wording yesterday
[5:13] he could talk good and things so just be
[5:16] pray that brother howl is real sick
[5:20] remember him just Lord be with him and
[5:23] sister Johnny she got to go home Friday
[5:25] I guess and she's doing better they have
[5:29] found two aneurysms and that said one of
[5:33] them was small and one of them was
[5:35] fairly large but remember that because
[5:38] they were thinking about doing a whole
[5:40] bunch of things and the word got out
[5:41] they were going to do this and that but
[5:43] they're not doing it they're going to
[5:45] let her as far as I know go herself to a
[5:48] you know a head doctor to
[5:51] um be checked out more and more and get
[5:53] everything in order all right brother
[5:55] Doherty he's not got the flu we all
[5:59] thought he had that but he got upper
[6:00] respiratory problems I talked to him
[6:03] this morning so just remember him in
[6:05] your prayers you know in this this and
[6:08] there's many many other sicknesses Among
[6:10] Us
[6:11] but yet we know who the healer is amen
[6:14] we know who's already taken care of it
[6:16] we may have to wait sometimes you know
[6:19] that's our part where our thoughts we
[6:20] think well I prayed why not why am I not
[6:23] better
[6:23] I was listening I think it was last
[6:25] night it might be in the Statue of a
[6:27] perfect man not for like and wrote
[6:28] around and said that's where he wants
[6:30] that you need patience
[6:32] you know when you've asked God
[6:34] he don't come on the scene immediately
[6:37] you need patience
[6:39] to wait upon him to bring it to pass all
[6:42] right and he'll do that all right man
[6:44] that's all right so let's sit and
[6:46] remember brother Louise
[6:48] he is down in Costa Rica but he's been
[6:52] having problems with his stroke he went
[6:54] there as an interpreter and I guess
[6:56] they're having to get somebody else or
[6:59] helping him one but he's sick so
[7:01] remember him and pray that the Lord
[7:03] would be with him he's got I guess
[7:05] another week or so and then he'll be
[7:08] heading back home so remember that all
[7:10] right remember all of the people around
[7:12] the world in the message of the hour
[7:14] that we pray that the Lord would bless
[7:16] and we don't have to ask him to
[7:18] because he promised him amen until we
[7:21] believe it all right let's just sing as
[7:23] Wade I think that's all the
[7:25] announcements oh no fellowship meeting

[8:08] good this morning he came in and I
[8:09] couldn't get the sound system I knew the
[8:12] mechanisms and checking everything I
[8:14] knew but I said well we need somebody
[8:16] and
[8:18] he walked in and all he had to do is
[8:20] walk up and push two buttons
[8:22] well I remember my brother-in-law one
[8:25] time he called an electrician over to
[8:28] his house and he asked him to come and
[8:30] help him an electrician came and all he
[8:33] done was took the thing out turned it
[8:36] over put it back in and it started
[8:38] working and my brother-in-law said well
[8:41] how much do I owe you and back then it
[8:43] was big money you know he said like
[8:45] twenty dollars
[8:46] he looked at him you know he said it's
[8:49] not what you do
[8:51] it's what you know
[8:55] that's pretty good so brother Tim I said

[10:47] foreign
[11:02] you are

[11:18] as long you think of all the Angels
[11:20] saying holy holy holy
[11:22] well you know when the bride sings it
[11:23] they have to shut up
[11:27] when we say if they have to be quiet
[11:29] because they don't know him as that Holy
[11:31] that we know him they know him as a holy
[11:34] God he created them for worship but he
[11:37] created us to be Sons and Daughters of
[11:39] the Living God to come straight from the
[11:41] source good to be in the house of the
[11:43] Lord good to have each and every one one
[11:45] of you with us today
[11:48] they have brother Tim Calhoun up here
[11:49] with us and good to see Mary Beth again
[11:52] as usual I told her when she came in I
[11:55] said you know your way around I said I
[11:57] ain't got to lead you nowhere you've
[11:58] been here before so
[12:00] don't have to uh don't have to lead the
[12:03] people that's been here they know what's
[12:05] going on so Lord bless each and every
[12:07] one of you uh by way of announcements
[12:10] brother Dale's already said but remember
[12:11] the fellowship meeting at my will leave
[12:13] my house about 10 30. and uh some of you
[12:16] want to go you can stay over at the
[12:17] house if you need to some of you and uh
[12:20] and all that also remember I know
[12:22] brother Dale said Luis was sick but
[12:24] Sister Christine said he's really sick
[12:27] uh really sick can't sleep at night
[12:31] a lot of congestion off he's running a
[12:33] fever or not but he's sick so he's had
[12:35] to stop interpreting a couple of times
[12:38] and and let somebody finish or for him
[12:41] to just take a little rest so it's one
[12:43] thing to be sick it's another thing to
[12:44] be sick in another country right he's in
[12:47] Nicaragua and I I you know that's a long
[12:49] way from home
[12:50] you can't drive from there to hear I
[12:52] don't think so uh just keep him in your
[12:55] prayers because uh
[12:57] like I said he's over there doing a job
[13:00] he's over there doing a job for the Lord
[13:02] and we should all bind together and pray
[13:03] for that man that that the Lord will
[13:06] touch him now not later now he needs to
[13:08] be touched now so we'll just keep him in
[13:11] your prayers and I uh
[13:13] um pray that he will
[13:15] that he will get the message that we are
[13:17] Binding Together to pray with him
[13:19] I also remember
[13:22] let's see what else I got here trying to
[13:24] get the list finished
[13:26] I think what we'll do today
[13:29] he just depressed on my heart this
[13:30] morning that um as we're speaking today
[13:34] we have our prayer cloths up here and we
[13:35] have some prayer napkins that were that
[13:39] we're going to preach over or pray over
[13:41] but for all this sickness that's going
[13:43] on I think we ought to all take an
[13:45] anointing cloth home with us
[13:47] put it over your door
[13:49] you say oh that's going
[13:51] I really don't care what you think right
[13:53] anointing oil the Bible says anoint with
[13:56] oil pray for the sick it doesn't take
[13:59] that out never has and never will until
[14:01] we get all perfected it's still going to
[14:04] be that we need a prayer cloth sure we
[14:06] got prayer cloths in our pocket for
[14:08] ourself but let's take one home with us
[14:11] today take that thing and tape it up
[14:13] over the doorpost of your home it
[14:15] doesn't matter if you get a bug out
[14:16] there when you walk under that thing
[14:19] may God's anointing oil just wipe that
[14:21] thing right off of you all right so I
[14:22] think we need to do that kind of kind of
[14:24] break it up anyway it's not going to
[14:26] hurt it's not going to hurt so we still
[14:29] believe in that
[14:30] amen amen we believe in praying for the
[14:32] sick
[14:33] hey man
[14:34] also remember
[14:36] me going to the Philippines February

[17:36] that's us that have obtained the light
[17:39] precious Faith with us through the
[17:41] righteousness of God
[17:43] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and

[17:54] amen amen in all of our Lives we need
[17:56] Grace and peace be multiplied not just
[17:58] give to you but multiplied unto you
[18:01] through the knowledge of God in Jesus
[18:03] our lord according as his there's that
[18:06] word divine there's only one divine
[18:08] and that's the almighty he's the only
[18:10] Divine One Satan's not Divine so we're
[18:13] not talking about him this morning amen
[18:14] according as his divine power hath given
[18:17] unto who
[18:19] us
[18:20] all things that pertain unto what life
[18:23] and godliness so that's what we're going
[18:25] to be speaking on through this whole
[18:26] statue of a perfect man is how to
[18:28] conduct yourself in your life
[18:31] and that godliness that applies to your
[18:33] life Glory because you know the way
[18:35] you're going to show God is through your
[18:36] what Your Life okay all right through
[18:39] the knowledge of him that has called us
[18:41] to glory and virtue whereby our given so
[18:44] there's things that are given unto us
[18:46] and they're not just giving they're
[18:47] given to us exceeding right exceeding
[18:50] great and precious promises that by
[18:52] these you might be partakers of the
[18:55] divine nature the food may be good but
[18:57] you got to eat it
[19:00] having escaped the corruption that is in
[19:02] the world through lust and then what
[19:04] we're speaking on last week and besides
[19:07] this right
[19:08] all right what we're going to be talking
[19:10] about today
[19:12] is the besides this man
[19:15] okay verse 1 through verse 5 or 4 is
[19:20] talking about the new birth
[19:22] right amen
[19:23] there's only one divine nature and
[19:25] that's the new birth of God that's God's
[19:26] nature okay and if you don't have it
[19:29] you're not born again if you have it
[19:30] then you have the divine nature of God
[19:32] Amen all right so we must see then that
[19:34] we truly must be born again I don't care
[19:36] what other Doctrine you've heard in this
[19:39] church we believe you got to be born
[19:40] again before you even get into the
[19:41] pyramid get into the body and that's
[19:44] what the prophet taught man amen so if
[19:46] the prophet taught it and the Bible
[19:47] taught it and we taught it then
[19:48] somewhere in those three we got to be
[19:50] right because there is a perfecting of
[19:52] the Saints as we were talking about the
[19:54] other day and besides this
[19:57] and besides this new birth that I've
[19:59] been talking about Peter says and
[20:01] besides this giving all diligence
[20:03] add to your faith virtue into virtue
[20:06] knowledge and all these Temperance
[20:07] Temperance patience to patience
[20:09] godliness and godliness brotherly
[20:10] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[20:11] charity for if these things be in you
[20:14] and abound amen not just be in you and
[20:17] abound they make you it's going to turn
[20:21] your nature from the old man to the new
[20:23] man it's going to make you yeah
[20:27] that's what he says that you shall
[20:29] neither be Barren nor unfruitful so
[20:32] you're going to bear fruit
[20:34] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[20:36] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[20:38] in other words he that just gets born
[20:39] again and sets down and and becomes a
[20:42] good church member right
[20:44] he didn't lacketh these things is blind
[20:47] and cannot see now what is that word see
[20:50] that doesn't mean that your natural
[20:51] eyesight has been diminished that word
[20:54] see means understanding okay and cannot
[20:57] understand afar off in other words
[20:59] further on the further moment of the
[21:01] Revelation you cannot understand if you
[21:03] don't have these virtues working in your
[21:05] life and have forgotten that he was
[21:08] purged from his old sins
[21:10] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[21:12] diligence look at that word diligence
[21:14] look how many times this deal that's
[21:16] suppressing diligence diligence to make
[21:19] your calling an election sure
[21:21] for if you do these things
[21:24] ye shall never
[21:28] fall amen amen the Lord bless his word
[21:30] and you can be seated ye shall never
[21:33] fall
[21:35] what a what a what a promise amen you
[21:39] shall never fall right you say oh I fall
[21:42] every day well the Bible says if you'll
[21:45] do these things you won't maybe that's
[21:47] our problem
[21:48] we're not doing we know how the virtues
[21:50] work in our life it's because we're so
[21:51] up and down and in and out and all those
[21:52] things right amen amen
[21:56] pretty straightforward sometimes all
[21:58] right let's go to Ephesians 4 and as we
[21:59] were talking kind of background last
[22:01] last Sunday
[22:03] all right
[22:04] we're going to read uh
[22:07] Ephesians 4 in just a second but I tell
[22:09] you what put up the uh put up the
[22:11] picture the first one brother Anderson
[22:14] and let's do that and then we'll work
[22:15] our way down to this because as we were
[22:17] speaking for those of you that weren't
[22:18] here last Sunday
[22:20] um because we skipped that one if you go
[22:22] back to the where it says centerpiece
[22:24] you'll go to the I want you to look at
[22:25] this new
[22:27] isn't that good
[22:29] I told him I said that's a neat little
[22:30] camo pair and we might have to at the
[22:33] market that camouflage pattern now I
[22:34] think it looks good but actually it's
[22:36] Stones that's like a granite rock that
[22:38] Brother Anderson took off the internet
[22:40] so I like that
[22:42] I like that a lot it really showed but
[22:44] see here we come to
[22:47] Peter tells us what we must have amen
[22:52] then Paul in Ephesians 4 is going to
[22:55] tell us how to get it right
[22:57] all right Peter tells us gives us the
[23:00] outline shows us what we need or what's
[23:03] required amen and then Paul in Ephesians
[23:06] 4 is going to tell us how to get it so
[23:08] so someone is telling us we need it and
[23:11] someone is showing us how to get it so
[23:14] God's so gracious he's not going to lay
[23:16] something out there and not give you a
[23:18] way to get to it amen because the most
[23:21] ignorant person the most unlearned
[23:23] person
[23:24] of the Apostles was Peter
[23:28] yet he brought this great
[23:31] statue of a perfect man
[23:33] to the apostles in the beginning and
[23:36] they grew on that even Paul grew on that
[23:39] right all right exactly because it came
[23:41] to Peter but this is the centerpiece as
[23:44] we were talking about just to review a
[23:45] little bit from last Sunday this is the
[23:48] centerpiece of the message
[23:50] all right when you take the table and
[23:52] you got the whole message out here and
[23:54] and it's called the table now you know
[23:56] and on the internet but you've got this
[23:59] table set out but what's the first thing
[24:01] that attracts your attention a beautiful
[24:03] centerpiece right
[24:05] so the centerpiece of this message you
[24:08] cannot as I was telling you last uh last
[24:11] Sunday this is not an elective course to
[24:14] get you into adoption right
[24:18] you know we had elective courses I told
[24:20] them last Sunday that you know you see
[24:23] these football players that graduate
[24:24] with a PhD in Pottery
[24:27] well that's going to help a lot yeah if
[24:30] you want to go in the Pottery business
[24:32] but he took a lot of electives but there
[24:34] were required courses that you had to
[24:37] take even though if you wanted to be a
[24:39] teacher or a doctor you had to start
[24:41] with the required courses you had to
[24:44] take English 101 English 102. English
[24:47] 103 that's when I was going to school
[24:49] they were required for graduation so
[24:52] these virtues are required for your
[24:55] graduation to adoption you're not going
[24:58] to be adopted just because you're
[25:00] sitting here under somebody that
[25:01] preaches adoption
[25:04] it's an individual affair with God right
[25:06] so these virtues are a requirement you
[25:09] can't bypass that and you hear so many
[25:11] people say wow we're in the adoption Age
[25:13] We Are
[25:15] we are in the adoption age but there's
[25:18] got to be people that are adopted to
[25:20] make it the adoption age
[25:22] amen you can't just call it the adoption
[25:25] age and nobody be there right right but
[25:28] there's a foundation that we have to
[25:30] start with
[25:32] we have to start with an introduction we
[25:35] have to start you know Foundation means
[25:37] beginning got to have a sure foundation
[25:39] and that's what we're going to talk
[25:40] about today but remember it all begins
[25:43] with a desire we're going to read that
[25:45] same quote where brother Brown said it's
[25:47] how much Faith you have is how high you
[25:50] can rise
[25:51] exactly not how much Faith the pastor
[25:52] has or how much faith brother Branham
[25:54] had
[25:56] it's how much Faith you got amen and
[25:58] we're going to talk about faith today
[26:00] and we're going to talk about faith
[26:01] maybe and it may be this afternoon that
[26:03] we talk about faith maybe in a little
[26:04] way a way that that I believe the Lord
[26:07] showed me to to help me with faith not
[26:10] just say well we got to have faith so
[26:12] we'll have faith no it's just that's not
[26:14] true
[26:15] um
[26:16] actually you're born faithless
[26:21] if you're born with faith you wouldn't
[26:22] eat it right right
[26:25] right
[26:26] we're all contrary by Nature
[26:29] contrary is not faith
[26:32] that's right okay your all born contrary
[26:34] without the nature of God right
[26:38] okay so maybe we'll get into that this
[26:40] afternoon but
[26:42] you must have a desire to want these
[26:44] because they are there they are given to
[26:46] you at your new birth but you must grow
[26:49] you must grow in Grace and knowledge you
[26:52] must hear the word
[26:54] and let that word
[26:56] bring it alive all right because you get
[26:59] everything you need for your journey
[27:01] it's just you are the one you and I are
[27:03] free moral agents brother Tim till the
[27:05] day we're changed we're a free moral
[27:07] agent right you're going to decide
[27:08] whether you're going to die and go by
[27:10] the grave or whether you're going to
[27:11] stand for the change one of the two
[27:12] right and it's according to your faith
[27:16] all right but faith comes by what
[27:22] not sitting at home
[27:24] right now let's go to Ephesians 4.
[27:26] Paul's going to lay out the whole
[27:28] program
[27:30] how are you going to get these virtues
[27:32] all right
[27:33] Ephesians 4.
[27:37] and he what he gave some apostles
[27:42] some prophets some evangelists some
[27:45] pastors and teachers Right For What
[27:49] for their perfecting
[27:51] of the Saints right amen all right watch
[27:54] the perfecting of the Saints all the way
[27:56] up at the top that's the perfect that's
[27:58] the statue of a perfect man this is not
[28:00] the statue of a perfect man this is the
[28:02] stature of a perfect man we'll show it
[28:04] to you in just a minute but for the
[28:06] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[28:08] the ministry for the edifying of the
[28:10] white body that's me and you all right
[28:13] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[28:14] till
[28:18] he give you all that till right you come
[28:21] we
[28:23] all come in the unity of the faith and
[28:26] of the knowledge of the son of God
[28:28] unto a white perfect man amen right so
[28:32] God's give us I was telling them before
[28:34] last Sunday just review them for a
[28:35] minute
[28:36] this has to be a not a perfect you won't
[28:39] have a perfect Apostle a perfect Pastor
[28:42] a perfect teacher in their self we're
[28:44] not perfect right
[28:46] but there is a perfect message that must
[28:48] come through those five channels okay
[28:50] all right and if there is a perfect
[28:52] message then they have to bring it to
[28:54] you
[28:55] amen for the perfecting of the Saints
[28:58] till we all come into the unity of faith
[29:00] and of the knowledge
[29:02] not human knowledge the knowledge of the
[29:05] Son of God unto a perfect man right unto
[29:10] the measure all right measure is what
[29:12] development measure of the stature of
[29:15] the fullness of Christ not just part of
[29:17] it all right right that we henceforth be
[29:20] no more children
[29:22] now when we start today or maybe this
[29:24] evening whenever we get to it that Faith
[29:26] starting at Faith that's children
[29:29] amen your child
[29:32] you must learn you must grow up that we
[29:35] henceforth there'll be no more children
[29:37] right toss to and fro and carried about
[29:40] with every wind of Doctrine look at it
[29:42] happening in the end time now yeah by
[29:44] the slight of men so it had to come from
[29:47] men it come from an imperfect Prophet
[29:50] Pastor teacher evangelist and Pastor I
[29:52] mean all the five right
[29:54] because Hey Brother Brown said false
[29:56] teachers bring false verse so they're
[29:57] bringing something yes it's just false
[30:00] right right anointed ones at the end
[30:02] time
[30:04] we're dealing with it now by the slight
[30:07] of men and the cunning and cunning
[30:09] craftiness wherebys they lie and wait to
[30:12] deceive
[30:13] but speak the truth in love may grow up
[30:17] grow up into him in all things which is
[30:20] the head even Christ from whom the whole
[30:23] body fitly joined even in the natural
[30:26] pyramids you can't put a knife blade in
[30:28] between those huge Stones we can't
[30:31] duplicate that even in the end time that
[30:33] it's so so compacted together
[30:36] that you can't put a knife blade between
[30:38] them that's pretty good for all them
[30:40] they said there's several million of
[30:42] them stones in those pyramids to make
[30:44] every one of them fit the right way and
[30:45] it'd be a stone yes yes had to be
[30:47] Almighty help them do that from whom
[30:49] they'll hope but you know what he's
[30:51] requiring that of me and you that Satan
[30:54] can't put a knife blade in between my
[30:56] faith and my virtue of my knowledge your
[30:58] faith your virtual your knowledge Satan
[31:00] can't get a Headway into that amen
[31:04] that's the problem now yeah we got
[31:06] cracks
[31:09] in our walk or in our growth development
[31:12] or in our measurement of of the fullness
[31:16] of Christ For Whom the whole body fitly
[31:17] joined together and compacted
[31:19] right man not just put the building in
[31:22] but I mean pack that baby in right
[31:24] by that which every joint supplies
[31:28] according to the effectual working
[31:31] look at these words that are that are
[31:33] that are action words yes
[31:36] they're all action diligent well you see
[31:39] all this and I'm telling you it takes an
[31:42] overcoming
[31:44] amen you got to overcome something to
[31:46] come to church it's easy to sit at home
[31:47] and watch it on the internet I know some
[31:49] people have to but Overcomers come to
[31:51] church
[31:53] and then Overcomers can go to
[31:54] Revelations and see all those eight
[31:56] different overcomings that you get
[31:58] blessed by the reason we're not getting
[32:00] blessed is because we're doing not doing
[32:01] what God Said Amen
[32:05] terrific
[32:06] gotta hear it from the back
[32:10] everywhere
[32:11] that's our problem that's our problem
[32:14] right according to the effectual working
[32:17] and the measure of every part maketh
[32:20] increase of the body
[32:23] that means we all grow together unto the
[32:25] edifying of itself that's right yeah so
[32:28] we edify ourself in love all right one
[32:32] for the other not adding to that but one
[32:35] to the other addict now look
[32:37] remember last Sunday let me just still
[32:40] reviewing there's what Paul is telling
[32:43] you how to get it you got to listen to a
[32:46] perfect word to become perfected you
[32:48] can't be perfected by non-word right all
[32:51] right so you got to have the right kind
[32:53] of word but there is a suffering there
[32:55] is an overcoming that remember we read
[32:58] the quote where brother Brown says power
[32:59] without character is satanic right so we
[33:02] must have we we know we have the power
[33:04] the Holy Ghost is the power amen amen
[33:07] the Holy Ghost is the power we have that
[33:09] power it was released on the day of
[33:11] Pentecost if you want to put an age on
[33:14] the Holy Ghost it's 2 000 years old
[33:16] you understand what I'm saying right
[33:18] right you know I mean it's been here for
[33:19] a while I'm saying it's not something
[33:21] new right brother Brown did not come to
[33:23] bring us the new birth
[33:26] or a different way to get it or God
[33:29] changed his mind from Paul to here right
[33:32] brother Branham came to expound or
[33:34] expand or to what I think he brought to
[33:37] fitly join together and compact the word
[33:41] that was already here right he didn't
[33:43] come to bring us a new word he took that
[33:46] word that we had
[33:48] man man had eat that thing to where it
[33:52] wasn't of any effect that's right
[33:54] the faith of the people had been
[33:56] deteriorated against the word of God the
[33:59] Catholic Church says no you don't need
[34:00] to read it we'll tell you what it says
[34:01] yeah right well see that's where it
[34:03] started and then it becomes the
[34:05] denominations where you got Baptist
[34:07] Methodist Pentecostal whatever the brown
[34:09] of mites
[34:10] that have eroded the word so much that
[34:12] God can't work he can't work in non-word
[34:15] all right though it may be the letter of
[34:18] the word
[34:20] remember though it be the letter of the
[34:22] word right
[34:23] but it takes the power and the character
[34:26] amen amen we have the power now it takes
[34:29] the character of God to bring that power
[34:32] to the right position because power
[34:34] without character is satanic right right
[34:37] power
[34:39] without character what happened to
[34:44] Judas
[34:45] Judas had the power
[34:48] he preached they cast out Devils they
[34:50] healed the sick
[34:54] Jesus told him you have the power go go
[34:57] preach the gospel
[34:59] but Judas didn't have the character of
[35:02] God right we know he didn't have the new
[35:04] birth in his soul because none of them
[35:05] had a new birth until Jesus died and
[35:08] come back on the day of Pentecost we
[35:09] know that
[35:10] but Judas was so close
[35:13] he had the power of God but his power
[35:17] and his character wasn't together
[35:20] so so that made him satanic that made
[35:23] him what he was so that's the same thing
[35:25] with you and I so we need we have to
[35:27] suffer to reign
[35:31] we must overcome
[35:35] remember it's not what you overcome it's
[35:36] how you overcome it all right then we
[35:39] must have the power and the character to
[35:42] go along with it right to bring us up to
[35:44] the Statue of a fullness of Christ now
[35:47] also here we'll keep going remember we
[35:49] read the scripture there in Galatians
[35:51] where that the law was a Schoolmaster
[35:54] right right to bring us to Christ it
[35:57] didn't put us in Christ it brought us to
[35:59] Christ it puts you it puts you in a way
[36:02] to where that you realize you were lost
[36:07] you have to realize you were lost before
[36:09] you can be saved hey man so the the law
[36:12] brought you the do's and don'ts of the
[36:13] law brought you the school Master
[36:15] remember the school Master School master
[36:17] was not necessarily the teacher
[36:20] the school master was the principal
[36:21] right right when we were growing up we
[36:24] had principles but back on further later
[36:27] you know back into 15 1600s they had
[36:30] they had school Masters or they called
[36:32] them School arms
[36:33] and when you got in trouble that's where
[36:35] you went because she knew all the do's
[36:37] and don'ts the teacher was the one that
[36:39] was teaching you the ABCs in the one two
[36:40] threes the school Masters the one that
[36:42] kept you straight
[36:44] all right so that's what the law is the
[36:46] law is the school Master to bring you to
[36:48] Christ right all right but then Paul
[36:51] keeps going on Galatians 4 where he says
[36:54] but you're not under Schoolmaster
[36:56] anymore
[36:57] because when you get into Christ the
[37:00] school Master comes in you right
[37:03] right it's still do's and don'ts but
[37:05] it's a love of doing and don't and it's
[37:07] not a well I well you know I I cut my
[37:10] hair but they they say something about
[37:11] it no it's like June's always said and I
[37:14] use this as an example and Jim said if
[37:17] God himself can come down
[37:21] suffer what he suffered die on a cross
[37:24] give his life for me
[37:27] my little bit of Glory back to him if he
[37:29] says don't cut your hair I'm not going
[37:31] to cut my hair right
[37:34] amen you know what God Honors that
[37:38] you know what the Bible says about about
[37:40] cutting hair
[37:43] okay you can read it still the word of
[37:45] God I don't care where you go amen
[37:47] all right
[37:50] where was I
[37:52] School Master then you are now under
[37:55] tutors and governors
[37:57] the holy ghost is now the tutor or the
[38:00] teacher and the governor of your life
[38:03] should be once you get born again it's
[38:06] it's not do's and don'ts we're going to
[38:07] read a scripture in a minute where or
[38:09] maybe later on where Paul says leaving
[38:11] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[38:12] now look let me explain that real quick
[38:15] for those of you that may not come back
[38:16] this afternoon that gets all over today
[38:18] and don't need the rest of the rest of
[38:20] the service I don't understand you're
[38:21] not doing what the Bible says but uh see
[38:23] there we go you think well I'm sick well
[38:26] okay
[38:28] but anyway
[38:29] if you take
[38:31] and if I leave Gillsville Georgia and
[38:34] I'm going to see brother Tim in
[38:35] Manchester Tennessee I'm leaving
[38:38] Gillsville to go to Manchester Tennessee
[38:41] amen but I'm not doing away with
[38:44] Gillsville as I leave
[38:46] right so see Paul's not saying leaving
[38:48] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[38:50] in other words let's don't do them
[38:52] things anymore no do's and don'ts and
[38:53] water baptism and all that no he's
[38:55] saying we're going to leave that and
[38:57] we're going to continue on to Manchester
[39:00] Tennessee gillesville Georgia's still
[39:01] there
[39:03] but I'm leaving that
[39:05] and I'm going to Manchester I'm leaving
[39:07] the principles of what my Foundation is
[39:09] and I'm going to carry on to another
[39:12] level I'm not doing away with this
[39:15] because that's our foundation that's
[39:18] what we're talking about today okay now
[39:22] bring the picture up we read the
[39:24] scripture of course how that that Jesus
[39:27] was what he had a uh he was the
[39:29] headstone
[39:33] next next picture
[39:35] bear with him for a minute see there's
[39:37] your picture now what happened was
[39:38] remember the Bible says The Headstone
[39:40] was rejected
[39:42] right
[39:44] so that's the way it looks now
[39:48] amen if you're growing if you're
[39:50] starting your growth okay
[39:52] because the headstone was rejected
[39:54] wasn't put on the pier the actual
[39:56] pyramid saw The Headstone which is
[39:58] Christ
[39:59] all right the son of man
[40:01] he had to go away
[40:04] he was rejected amen they rejected the
[40:07] son of man okay they rejected the son of
[40:09] man now we know the Son of God was in
[40:11] the son of man but just to keep it
[40:12] simple they rejected The Headstone well
[40:15] they done away with him
[40:16] right had their own Creeds their own
[40:19] ideas and whatever but what he did was
[40:21] he didn't disappear brother Tim and go
[40:23] away he comes right back down the corner
[40:26] of the scripture and becomes what
[40:29] bring it up head of the corner right
[40:32] he comes right down here and starts
[40:34] building that building again right
[40:37] right amen
[40:38] he comes right here that's just a little
[40:40] pyramid each one of those squares or
[40:43] each one of those uh Corners is a little
[40:47] pyramid in itself and what he's going to
[40:49] do he's going to come right down here
[40:50] and he's going to build you back up he
[40:52] doesn't need building back up that's
[40:53] right
[40:54] man you can't tear down Jesus Christ
[40:57] but you can tear down the effects of
[40:58] what he said and that's what the world's
[41:00] been doing for all these years but right
[41:02] here he comes right back down here with
[41:04] the love of God
[41:05] on the cornerstone and becomes the head
[41:08] of the corner
[41:10] what to bring us back up to adoption
[41:13] yeah to the son of man Revelation in the
[41:16] end time this was the son of God through
[41:19] seven Church ages right
[41:21] the Holy Ghost all right got that
[41:24] but remember the Son of God is Not does
[41:27] not get adopted right son of God's the
[41:29] Holy Ghost he is the adopter yes
[41:32] hey man he's the he's the one that does
[41:34] the adopting amen
[41:36] but the son of man is the only one that
[41:38] can reach adoption so down through the
[41:40] down through the seven Church ages man
[41:42] done away with him
[41:45] but God started right back here on the
[41:47] day of Pentecost started building a
[41:49] foundation
[41:50] from the Cornerstone right right
[41:52] building it up to back up to where man
[41:56] can be adopted that's why in the end
[41:58] time the only way the son of man could
[42:00] come back was the Gospel of the son of
[42:02] man had to be preached
[42:04] amen with no listen to me with no error
[42:10] did Jesus have error when he was
[42:12] standing here on Earth
[42:14] foreign
[42:16] if you say if you say the son of man
[42:19] Ministry is back on the earth there's no
[42:22] error to that ministry right exactly
[42:24] right because you can't get you can't be
[42:27] adopted he would have not took Jesus up
[42:28] there on the mountain and adopted him if
[42:32] there was some error there somewhere
[42:33] right so you say well you got your ideas
[42:35] and I've got my ideas and I've heard
[42:36] this brother's got his ideas there's
[42:38] only one truth
[42:40] amen
[42:41] there's only one truth
[42:45] it's like brother Trevor told that guy
[42:46] the other day on that video that he was
[42:48] doing with uh there were some brothers
[42:51] come from Africa to the Tabernacle
[42:54] giving out trash did anybody see that
[42:56] giving out tracks
[42:59] promoting polygamy
[43:01] through the prophet's message
[43:04] yeah and brother Trevor said brother you
[43:08] know what he said I'm not going to argue
[43:09] with you
[43:11] he said either you're wrong and I'm
[43:13] right
[43:14] or I'm wrong and you're right but we
[43:16] both can't be right right that's right
[43:18] when it comes to God you both can't have
[43:20] the different opinion and be right
[43:23] it's got to be one Faith one Lord and
[43:26] one baptism right if I would have been
[43:28] up there I said look brother you can
[43:29] have all the wives you want
[43:31] front but you ain't in the message right
[43:33] you have all wives you want go back to
[43:35] Africa and have all the women you want I
[43:38] said you just got a lust Spirit on you
[43:39] that's all right
[43:41] and if you can handle four or five
[43:42] different wives you a better man than I
[43:44] am
[43:47] and the men say Amen
[43:52] the truth anyhow that is the truth right
[43:54] okay then if they can have them they can
[43:57] have all they want but they're not in
[43:58] the Bible
[44:00] they're not in the prophet's message
[44:01] that's for sure
[44:03] but you know what the brother took the
[44:05] book marriage and divorce and kept
[44:08] pointing the prophet said the prophet
[44:11] said the prophet said he was saying it
[44:13] right out of what this message is he
[44:15] wasn't taking no other book he took that
[44:17] marriage and divorce book and was proven
[44:19] polygamy to all those people up there
[44:22] so don't tell me that the letter of the
[44:24] words got any power
[44:28] the letter of the word has no power
[44:30] right man
[44:31] this power behind the letter
[44:34] amen the power behind the letter and
[44:36] that's what we're talking about here we
[44:37] can we can say all we need these we need
[44:39] these that's what we've been saying for
[44:41] 50 years yeah
[44:42] we need days we need days now we must
[44:45] have them
[44:47] and there is a way to get to them if
[44:49] you'll just listen all right so now
[44:52] we're going to start with a foundation
[44:55] we're going to start with a foundation
[44:56] if you'll take all those away and put us
[44:58] down to one
[45:00] we're going to talk about faith today
[45:02] all right
[45:06] we have to have a starting point
[45:11] amen and it's called faith
[45:13] all right can everybody see that can you
[45:16] raise that up a little bit I think the
[45:17] ones in the back can't see it
[45:21] if not that's okay can everybody see
[45:23] that Richard can you see it okay all
[45:25] right if you can see it on the back row
[45:27] we're fine
[45:28] so let's go to Hebrews 5
[45:31] . now remember the remember the parable
[45:33] of a man building his house and on Sand
[45:35] and then one building on the Rock we all
[45:37] know that okay
[45:38] a rock is what a revelation Iraq is a
[45:42] firm foundation all right so now in
[45:45] Hebrews 5 verse 8
[45:51] all right
[45:53] everybody got it okay they got it though
[45:55] he were a son now this is Jesus though
[45:58] he were a son yet learned he obedience
[46:00] by the things which he suffered that's
[46:03] right and being made perfect
[46:06] he became the author of Eternal
[46:08] salvation to all them that obey him
[46:12] called of God and high priest after the
[46:15] order of Melchizedek
[46:16] of whom we have many things to say
[46:20] and hard to be uttered seeing ye are
[46:23] dull of hearing right
[46:25] right this is Paul but he's talking to
[46:27] us
[46:28] for when for the time you ought to be
[46:31] teachers right
[46:33] you have need that one teach you again
[46:36] which be the first principles of the
[46:39] Oracles of God
[46:40] and our become such as have need of milk
[46:43] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[46:46] uses milk is unskillful
[46:49] in the word of righteousness for he is a
[46:52] babe
[46:54] now he's not saying you don't need to be
[46:57] a babe
[46:58] he's saying you're staying a babe yeah
[47:00] right all right
[47:02] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[47:05] of full age even those who by reason of
[47:09] use
[47:12] exercise right
[47:16] even those who will by reason of use
[47:19] have their senses
[47:22] exercised to discern both good and evil
[47:25] right
[47:27] that means we must study that's what I
[47:29] said it's going to take you steady it's
[47:30] going to take a desire for you to say
[47:32] God I need these virtues and I want
[47:35] these virtues all right if you don't
[47:38] then I we can't help you
[47:40] all right all right let's go to Hebrews
[47:43] 6. let's read a few scriptures and see
[47:44] we're going to continue that was one
[47:46] through three and this is what we do
[47:48] look
[47:49] therefore leaving
[47:51] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[47:53] now there's only one it doesn't say
[47:54] doctrines
[47:56] this doctrine of Christ
[47:58] let us go on to Perfection not laying
[48:01] again the foundation of repentance from
[48:04] dead works and a faith toward God
[48:07] so we're not gonna We're not gonna start
[48:09] with faith and then we're going to start
[48:10] building another little uh you know
[48:12] you're you're not going to build your
[48:13] own Foundation over here on the side
[48:14] it's not you
[48:16] has nothing to do with you
[48:19] it's God
[48:20] all right not laying again the
[48:22] foundation of repentance from dead works
[48:24] and the faith toward god of the doctrine
[48:26] of baptism and of laying on of hands and
[48:27] of resurrection of the dead and of
[48:29] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[48:32] God permits right well God has permitted
[48:34] for it to be done so don't worry about
[48:36] it it is being done all right let's go
[48:38] to First Corinthians three
[48:42] verse 9
[48:44] . I like this scripture here for we are
[48:47] laborers together with God
[48:50] with God
[48:51] ye are God's husbandry
[48:54] you're God's Building
[48:56] according to the grace of God which is
[48:58] given unto me as a wise master builder
[49:00] now who is this Paul Paul's age was that
[49:03] first church age right then there was
[49:04] his faith all right that was the
[49:06] foundation of all Christianity came from
[49:09] Paul Peter James John the 12 apostles
[49:12] all right because we're going to read
[49:13] here in just a minute that's what it was
[49:15] built on as a wise master builder I have
[49:18] laid the foundation
[49:20] and another buildeth their own upon you
[49:23] he's going to lay the foundation but he
[49:25] knew he wasn't the only one to come
[49:26] right right
[49:27] and another another buildeth thereon but
[49:31] let every man take heed how he buildeth
[49:34] thereupon right
[49:36] okay take heed it's got to be built
[49:39] right it can't be built amen according
[49:42] to somebody else's Foundation Paul laid
[49:45] the foundation brother Brown says many
[49:47] times Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul he knew
[49:49] if he preached what Paul preached that
[49:51] he was on the right road because Paul
[49:52] preached his straight the first time all
[49:54] right for other Foundation can no man
[49:58] lay that is laid for a other Foundation
[50:01] can no man lay that is laid which is
[50:03] Jesus Christ so he's the foundation of
[50:05] it all all right we know that now if any
[50:07] man build upon this Foundation gold
[50:09] silver precious stones would have
[50:10] stubble Every Man's work
[50:14] shall be made manifest
[50:16] right amen
[50:18] your Works shows your faith
[50:21] amen all right
[50:23] faithful that works is dead but works is
[50:26] not Faith that's right and it's totality
[50:28] right right because you can work
[50:29] yourself to death and not have no faith
[50:31] at all we'll talk about that maybe a
[50:33] little bit later
[50:34] on this evening all right every man's
[50:36] work shall be made manifest
[50:38] for the day shall declare it
[50:41] see our day is going to declare what we
[50:43] believe that's right amen our day is
[50:46] going to declare what we believe because
[50:47] it shall be revealed by fire
[50:50] and the fire shall try every man's work
[50:54] you're gonna be tried
[50:56] of what short it is
[50:58] Glory if any man's work abide which he
[51:01] hath Bill thereupon he shall receive a
[51:03] reward
[51:05] if any man's work shall be burned he
[51:07] shall suffer loss
[51:09] but he himself shall be saved yet so as
[51:12] by fire exactly amen amen know ye not
[51:16] that you are the temple of God
[51:18] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[51:20] you he's asking the question see the
[51:23] question mark
[51:24] Source left up to you to tell Paul or me
[51:27] or brother Dale or whoever the world
[51:30] that you have the spirit of God in you
[51:31] all right if any man defile the temple
[51:34] of God
[51:36] him shall God destroy that's right
[51:39] for the temple of God is Holy
[51:41] which Temple ye
[51:43] are amen amen that's pretty
[51:46] self-explanatory
[51:48] but that's got to be the foundation
[51:51] now go to Ephesians 2
[51:54] verse 19-22 we read this one last Sunday
[51:57] this is where Christ is the head but
[52:01] he's now become the Chief Cornerstone
[52:02] but watch this now therefore ye Are No
[52:05] More Strangers in follower foreigners
[52:07] but fellow citizens with the Saints
[52:10] you've come into a new family right
[52:13] you're not this is not this is not the
[52:17] family of the world that's right it's
[52:19] just what I was I was studying on
[52:20] yesterday morning this is not this has
[52:23] nothing to do with the world
[52:26] nothing not one thing but Tim out here
[52:28] yeah this all has to do with the world
[52:31] that's right even your justification and
[52:33] sanctification you're still you still
[52:35] have that worldly part right
[52:37] amen you you got a worldly nature until
[52:40] you're born again that's right and
[52:41] you're born again and what faith So you
[52:43] you're not in this body you're not in
[52:46] this Kingdom you're not in this family
[52:47] you're not in this city
[52:51] until you're born again
[52:53] right so there's nothing of the world in
[52:55] this it's not worldly patients we have
[52:58] there's many people in the world that
[52:59] has patience that's not godly patients
[53:02] amen these are all God virtues not man
[53:05] virtue amen all right because we're born
[53:07] contrary to God right now therefore
[53:09] you're No More Strangers than foreigners
[53:11] but fellow citizens with the Saints and
[53:14] of the household of God all right and
[53:17] are built upon the foundation
[53:19] of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus
[53:21] Christ himself being the Chief
[53:23] Cornerstone we showed that a minute ago
[53:25] in whom all the building
[53:27] fitly framed together
[53:31] growth right that's right growth
[53:34] development growth unto an Holy Temple
[53:37] in the Lord
[53:38] in whom ye also are building together
[53:41] for inhabitation of God through the
[53:45] spirit you cannot be a habitation of God
[53:47] until you have the spirit of God in you
[53:53] why is the Bible say the unclean Spirit
[53:54] has to go out of a man
[53:56] the unclean Spirit has to go out of a
[53:58] man because you're born listen we're
[54:00] born wrong we're born with an unclean
[54:01] Spirit let's just agree with that
[54:04] you weren't born no different than than
[54:06] Adolf Hitler right
[54:09] oh I had this seed in me and I had that
[54:11] oh forget it people
[54:13] you were born dead
[54:16] I found a quote the other day where
[54:17] brother Brown said you were born with a
[54:19] sinful soul and how much more can you
[54:23] you're born with a sinful Soul let's
[54:24] just let's just say we were born dead
[54:26] lost exactly
[54:29] out of this Kingdom
[54:31] sure God knew we were coming in God in
[54:33] you God had a word for us he had a seed
[54:35] for us sure
[54:37] but it came to me it wasn't in me if it
[54:40] was in Me God didn't have to die on a
[54:42] cross right
[54:43] he died on a cross to release that life
[54:46] so it could come into me
[54:48] man Lord have mercy Jesus people come on
[54:52] Jesus even breathed on his disciples and
[54:54] said receive ye the Holy Ghost now did
[54:55] they receive the Holy Ghost right then
[54:57] no no now why didn't that seed Quicken
[54:59] right then if it was already in them
[55:00] right the word himself
[55:02] said
[55:04] receive ye the Holy Ghost wasn't a
[55:06] second person that was God Almighty that
[55:09] said it and it didn't Quicken that seed
[55:10] because that seed was laying there it
[55:12] was dead in the word right
[55:14] but when he came back on the day of
[55:16] Pentecost
[55:17] that word came to the people
[55:20] and it quickened what they held on to
[55:23] Lori amen
[55:24] that you know what that makes God I've
[55:26] said it before that makes God adjust God
[55:28] he can't be a just God if he birthed you
[55:31] a different way than he birthed anybody
[55:32] else
[55:36] one more time
[55:38] because if one man can walk up to the
[55:40] day of judgment and say
[55:42] you made waydale different than me now
[55:44] don't tell me because remember the minds
[55:46] of everybody is going to be expounded
[55:47] when we get over there that's right in
[55:49] that theophany everybody's mind is going
[55:51] to be expanded they're going to know
[55:52] that they were a sinner they were lost
[55:54] and on their way to hell right but if
[55:57] they know that hey that guy was born
[55:59] different than me how can God be just
[56:01] right
[56:02] well they were my children
[56:05] well then you then you made me different
[56:08] it made me different
[56:10] all God's going to say is he chose me
[56:13] and you didn't that's the whole That's
[56:14] the basis brother Brown never said
[56:16] anything about free moral agency being
[56:19] done away with free moral agency is the
[56:22] soul of man to choose Faith or doubt you
[56:26] were not born with faith and doubt in
[56:28] your soul you were born with one or the
[56:30] other right not both all right everybody
[56:33] we know that here but there's a lot of
[56:34] people that don't understand that
[56:36] and they think there's some great
[56:37] something
[56:39] but Ephesians 2 in whom all the building
[56:42] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[56:44] holy Temple all right now look Hebrews
[56:46] 11. let's go there right now
[56:48] because we're going to start today
[56:51] on this Foundation
[56:54] called faith
[56:57] got it
[56:59] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[57:03] should not see death
[57:04] and was not found because God had
[57:06] translated him
[57:08] for before his translation not two days
[57:11] before he got her knowledge
[57:14] he walked 500 years with God
[57:17] amen for before his translation he had
[57:21] this testimony that he pleased God but
[57:24] but without faith it is impossible to
[57:28] please him who God impossible to please
[57:31] God you can't even understand Jesus
[57:34] Christ until you get born again all
[57:36] right for he that cometh through God
[57:38] Must Believe
[57:40] believe that he is what that he is God
[57:43] yes
[57:44] you got to believe that that's what I'm
[57:46] saying about this Faith thing this Faith
[57:48] thing is a belief in something right
[57:50] right
[57:51] that he is and he is a rewarder
[57:58] of them that what there's another one of
[58:01] those action words diligently right seek
[58:04] him right Paul like to use that word and
[58:06] so did Peter so we must be diligent
[58:09] about what we're doing all right so
[58:11] let's read one quote and then we'll make
[58:12] some comments here I want to get this
[58:14] get this first quote I want the prophet
[58:16] to tell us now look
[58:18] it's in the Statue of a perfect man
[58:20] number one I read this last Sunday but
[58:22] we're going to read it again this is
[58:23] where we're going to start from try to
[58:25] hold on to uh about another 15 or 20
[58:28] minutes
[58:30] all right
[58:32] paragraph 100 a man can't understand why
[58:35] people shout man can't understand why
[58:37] human beings language would change in
[58:39] his speaking tongues the natural man
[58:41] can't see how a glory of God would come
[58:44] over a man's eyes and he'd see visions
[58:46] and tell them of certain things and what
[58:47] to do and tell them things that's fixing
[58:49] to happen and fix things to come to pass
[58:52] like the Lord did for us here last night
[58:54] even see see the natural mind tries to
[58:57] figure it out well what did he do or
[59:00] what kind of a hoax is he using what
[59:02] gimmick has he got to see a man speaking
[59:04] in tongues they'd say somebody interpret
[59:06] and tell just exactly to a certain
[59:07] member of the body what they've done and
[59:10] what they should not do see see they
[59:12] think it's some kind of a hoax there's
[59:13] something fixed up between them that's
[59:15] what always they said you know but now
[59:17] look
[59:18] look at paragraph 101 they can't
[59:20] understand it till that man's born again
[59:24] all right so don't try to understand you
[59:27] can't understand God unless you're born
[59:28] again right
[59:29] right then we're going to back up and
[59:31] talk about the new birth and just a
[59:34] little in just a little bit then when
[59:36] he's born again then he's in line for
[59:39] Fellowship because he's a new creation
[59:42] that old suspicious doubting character
[59:45] he was is dead now he's a new creation
[59:48] so you see he don't have to add anything
[59:51] to his now because it'll automatically
[59:53] be added all right notice you must be
[59:57] born again I don't know where people
[59:58] under try to see that you got to get all
[1:00:01] these virtues before you get the Holy
[1:00:02] Spirit we'll discuss that Holy Spirit
[1:00:04] right there it is a different anointing
[1:00:06] than when you were born again absolutely
[1:00:08] but it's not you got to wait that far to
[1:00:11] get the new birth that's totally
[1:00:12] incorrect that there's no truth to that
[1:00:15] at all you can't put it in the Bible or
[1:00:16] the prophet's message because we just
[1:00:18] told you there Peter Peter said you got
[1:00:19] to have the divine nature of God and
[1:00:21] besides this
[1:00:23] add to your born-again experience virtue
[1:00:26] all right notice you must you must be
[1:00:28] born again and when you're born again
[1:00:30] you can't be born again without having
[1:00:33] faith
[1:00:34] that's right so you see on my chart here
[1:00:36] I got the very Foundation faith is the
[1:00:39] foundation of all of it
[1:00:41] so see though we may leave that
[1:00:43] Foundation of Faith you never quit
[1:00:46] believing
[1:00:47] it's always there right for without
[1:00:51] faith it's what impossible to please God
[1:00:53] now he's quoting scripture here he that
[1:00:55] cometh to God must believe that he is in
[1:00:58] a rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:01:00] him see he must be and when you're a
[1:01:03] skeptic of the Bible
[1:01:07] don't you remember when you were skeptic
[1:01:08] of the Bible
[1:01:11] whether you ever read it or not if you
[1:01:13] didn't read it you sure didn't believe
[1:01:15] it was even in existence right right so
[1:01:18] you're an unbeliever
[1:01:21] but when you're skeptic of the Bible
[1:01:23] when you're skeptic of the word being
[1:01:25] right
[1:01:26] you just might as well stay back until
[1:01:29] first you believe it
[1:01:30] all right see there's there's the first
[1:01:33] principles of the Oracles of God the
[1:01:35] water baptism the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:36] Christ the things that we learn you know
[1:01:39] the dress the hair and all that that's
[1:01:40] the that's that'll that'll that'll come
[1:01:43] that'll come may not be instantly but
[1:01:46] it'll it's got to come because it's
[1:01:47] contrary to the Bible if you don't do
[1:01:50] these things that the Bible says or you
[1:01:53] do things that the Bible says not to do
[1:01:54] all right that's iniquity that's right
[1:01:58] right when you're skeptic of the word
[1:02:00] being right you just might as well stay
[1:02:01] back
[1:02:02] until first you believe it what he's
[1:02:05] saying smoking drinking cussing cutting
[1:02:07] your hair running around with women
[1:02:10] no the reason you do that is because
[1:02:13] you're an unbeliever
[1:02:15] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[1:02:19] elements now look this is what we read
[1:02:20] last Sunday but I want you to see it
[1:02:22] look here brother Tim there's only two
[1:02:24] elements that controls the human being
[1:02:27] two so let's break it right down to just
[1:02:29] two elements
[1:02:31] that's either doubt or faith right yes
[1:02:35] one or the other not one and the other
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:39] you're possessed of one that dominates
[1:02:43] your life
[1:02:46] just depends on how much Faith you have
[1:02:50] how high you can rise
[1:02:52] depends on how much Faith you have
[1:02:55] right is how high you can rise
[1:02:57] but first it's got to be Faith let me
[1:03:01] stay on that foundation for a while now
[1:03:03] Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is
[1:03:06] what faith is the substance of things
[1:03:08] hoped for
[1:03:10] it's you already have it when you have
[1:03:12] faith because it's revealed in faith all
[1:03:16] right faith is the substance of things
[1:03:17] hoped for Hebrews 11 saying we'll cover
[1:03:19] that maybe this afternoon what is it
[1:03:22] what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence
[1:03:24] so it takes you right to that evidence
[1:03:26] the evidence is the holy evidence all
[1:03:28] right it's a holy evidence I like that
[1:03:31] quote I wish you I think I'm going to
[1:03:32] take that and put it up on my on my
[1:03:34] refrigerator Jim how high you can rise
[1:03:38] it's your job right right
[1:03:41] right but now look you got to get to
[1:03:44] where you can hear
[1:03:46] you got to get where you can hear
[1:03:47] because remember faith comes by hearing
[1:03:49] remember it comes by preaching of the
[1:03:51] word of God
[1:03:52] so you got to put yourself in these in
[1:03:55] these things is how high you can rise
[1:03:57] because you know what it's like I was
[1:03:59] telling them brother Tim brother Tim's a
[1:04:01] master electrician
[1:04:04] right brother Tim I mean he works on
[1:04:05] huge like big complexes
[1:04:09] I'm scared to take that
[1:04:12] see you laugh and that's okay you laugh
[1:04:14] because it does it scares me if I was to
[1:04:16] take him screws off of that uh plate
[1:04:18] right there scare me to death that I'm
[1:04:20] going to get electrocuted why because I
[1:04:22] don't have faith in myself because I
[1:04:24] don't understand right electricity but I
[1:04:27] know what he'll do to me if I put my
[1:04:29] finger in there but see brother Tim he's
[1:04:31] like well geez that's like a piece of
[1:04:32] candy I'll just take over here and move
[1:04:33] this I'm gonna move this over here and
[1:04:34] I'll move this over here don't turn the
[1:04:35] electricity off I can handle it don't
[1:04:37] turn it and he fix it puts it back why
[1:04:39] he's got faith in what he can do right
[1:04:41] because he's been taught he took the
[1:04:44] required courses in class right that's
[1:04:47] right he took the rig he took the
[1:04:49] required you know what I bet you he
[1:04:52] didn't sit at home
[1:04:53] and they had class and he said well I
[1:04:55] don't need it
[1:04:56] right that's right that's a good way to
[1:04:58] get killed
[1:05:00] yes it is right you fooled with
[1:05:01] electricity he foods with it's
[1:05:03] vaporization it ain't just burn it's
[1:05:06] like you're there a minute and then
[1:05:07] you're not there's only left is your
[1:05:09] shoes
[1:05:11] that's what brother Keith 3 said he sell
[1:05:13] that several times when he was in
[1:05:14] Jamaica he works on those great big
[1:05:15] complexes he saw a guy open a a thing up
[1:05:18] one time and it and it arced yes he
[1:05:22] stepped into it the guy opened the big
[1:05:24] panel up and he stepped into it and it
[1:05:26] it flash art and he said there was
[1:05:28] nothing left of the man but shoes
[1:05:30] he was gone
[1:05:33] but you know what it's because the man
[1:05:35] made a mistake he didn't have enough
[1:05:37] knowledge
[1:05:38] of what he was doing that's the same way
[1:05:41] with the word of God you must be
[1:05:43] skillful in the knowledge of the word
[1:05:45] how can you use a sword without having
[1:05:47] one first and then without trying to
[1:05:49] take and and practice and practice and
[1:05:51] practice that's what brother tell me
[1:05:53] practiced and he practiced he'd done the
[1:05:55] right things well obviously he ain't
[1:05:57] made a mistake in electrical part he's
[1:05:58] still sitting here okay so you know
[1:06:01] that's the same way with you and I we
[1:06:02] haven't made a mistake if we're sitting
[1:06:04] in church and we're listening to the
[1:06:05] word of God if we're doing the things of
[1:06:07] God well we're not making that kind of a
[1:06:09] mistake but that that's our problem
[1:06:10] because it's life and godliness that
[1:06:13] we're talking about it's it's our
[1:06:15] everyday life but brother Tim he is he's
[1:06:18] got the knowledge so therefore that
[1:06:20] doesn't scare him well that's the same
[1:06:21] way with the word of God the reason
[1:06:23] we're scared of the word of God are that
[1:06:25] we don't have faith it's because we
[1:06:28] don't believe the word of God's what it
[1:06:29] is
[1:06:31] that's just that's just basic ground
[1:06:34] level you know you say well well I just
[1:06:37] don't see it that means you don't
[1:06:38] understand it right okay
[1:06:40] you must understand God you must believe
[1:06:43] that he is at a rewarder of him that
[1:06:45] diligently seek you just as the
[1:06:46] scripture said But first you got to have
[1:06:48] faith
[1:06:49] now Faith Is What You Must Believe amen
[1:06:52] faith is what substance of things hoped
[1:06:54] for it's you already have it when you
[1:06:56] have faith because it's revealed in
[1:06:58] faith faith is the substance of things
[1:06:59] hoped for Hebrews 11. see the evidence
[1:07:02] what is it what kind of an Evidence a
[1:07:04] holy evidence right all right but it's
[1:07:07] got to be Faith now let's go to Romans
[1:07:10] 10 and then we'll stop right here for a
[1:07:12] minute and uh
[1:07:15] and pull our chart up and we'll start
[1:07:18] maybe do a little bit with justification
[1:07:20] all right
[1:07:21] Romans 10 everybody all right well
[1:07:23] everybody getting kind of where we're
[1:07:24] going here because we've got to have a
[1:07:26] foundation you got to be born again
[1:07:28] how then shall they call on him and whom
[1:07:31] they have not believed
[1:07:33] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:07:35] whom they have not heard right
[1:07:38] and how shall they hear about this
[1:07:40] person that they have not believed in
[1:07:42] without a preacher
[1:07:43] am I adding to the word I'm telling you
[1:07:46] what he's saying like Paul I'm
[1:07:48] interpolating a little bit in there
[1:07:49] because that's what he said and how
[1:07:50] shall they hear without a preacher hear
[1:07:52] what
[1:07:53] hear who they're believing in right
[1:07:55] right because you got to believe in
[1:07:57] something you haven't seen
[1:07:58] anybody seen Jesus down cross
[1:08:00] no only a movie right right it's hearsay
[1:08:06] but I believe that he did
[1:08:09] because the faith in me believes that he
[1:08:12] did
[1:08:13] exactly and we know absolutely he did
[1:08:15] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:08:18] sent it's written how beautiful it'll be
[1:08:19] to them to preach the gospel of peace
[1:08:21] bring Glad Tidings of good things but
[1:08:24] they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:08:27] it's awesome yeah Amen to that brother
[1:08:29] brother Ray Brazil says Lord who hath
[1:08:33] believed our report right
[1:08:37] I want to ask you one time one thing who
[1:08:39] has believed your report right
[1:08:42] right who has believed your report is
[1:08:45] your report in the world that God that
[1:08:47] they can look at you because remember I
[1:08:49] like what brother Williams said he said
[1:08:51] I don't want to be called religious
[1:08:53] the devil's religious
[1:08:56] but now the devil can't be a Christian
[1:08:57] right that's true devil can't be Christ
[1:09:00] can't be Christ he can't act like Christ
[1:09:03] now sure he can get close but he can't
[1:09:05] act just like Christ so I want to be
[1:09:07] called a Christian because remember the
[1:09:09] people in Antioch were called Christians
[1:09:10] because they acted like Christ they
[1:09:12] looked at the people in Antioch and they
[1:09:14] some of them that were still alive when
[1:09:15] Jesus was was alive and on the earth
[1:09:18] they'd look at him they'd looked at them
[1:09:20] and they said man they act the same why
[1:09:22] they were christ-like that's what
[1:09:23] Christian means so I don't want to be
[1:09:25] religious I want to be a Christian all
[1:09:27] right so then Faith now here here's the
[1:09:29] whole summation here in Romans so then
[1:09:31] Faith cometh by hearing right and
[1:09:34] hearing by the word of God Amen all
[1:09:37] right and like brother William said I
[1:09:38] like what he said too that the word
[1:09:39] that's the highest Apex of God right
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:42] amen Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:09:45] but my word will not pass away amen it's
[1:09:48] what God Said and you know what he can't
[1:09:49] change his mind right amen it's forever
[1:09:52] written this Bible is the true word of
[1:09:54] God
[1:09:55] the prophet of God didn't come and bring
[1:09:56] us a new Bible
[1:09:58] this Bible was revealed amen
[1:10:01] by The Prophet's message
[1:10:03] absolutely but you know what brother
[1:10:05] Brown even said he said if you leave if
[1:10:07] you leave that land on the page
[1:10:09] it can be doubted
[1:10:11] but when that ever comes in here
[1:10:15] if that ever comes in here
[1:10:17] even Satan
[1:10:20] can't doubt it he's got to know that if
[1:10:23] that's in here and he's not
[1:10:26] oh he's religious
[1:10:28] but he's not a Christian
[1:10:30] amen can't be one never can be a
[1:10:32] Christian never will be a Christian
[1:10:33] right but he definitely was the most
[1:10:36] first religious person in the world
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:40] I mean God was God but but Satan was
[1:10:42] religious all right so just speak I'm
[1:10:45] sorry
[1:10:47] yeah everybody's really you're right
[1:10:48] about that everybody's religious
[1:10:49] especially the people get in trouble and
[1:10:51] they find Jesus in jail you know they
[1:10:52] get religious when
[1:10:54] they go before the judge you know they
[1:10:56] when they got caught they had hair down
[1:10:58] to hair and Tattoos up to here but when
[1:11:00] they go meet the judge they got a
[1:11:01] long-sleeve shirt on and of course a
[1:11:03] lawyer tells him to do this puts a long
[1:11:05] sleeve shirt on to hide the tattoos and
[1:11:06] gets his hair cut first thing why he's
[1:11:08] presenting himself in front of a judge
[1:11:11] that's right does that sound familiar
[1:11:13] he's presenting himself before the judge
[1:11:16] but you know what he just cleaned the
[1:11:18] outside up right that's right he didn't
[1:11:21] clean the inside guy up when we present
[1:11:23] ourselves before the judge
[1:11:25] God he looks down in here first right
[1:11:28] and then sees what it works out to the
[1:11:31] outside so now Faith is what faith is
[1:11:35] the divine nature of God Amen the
[1:11:38] beginning of your Christian experience
[1:11:41] has to start with faith glory amen you
[1:11:46] have to start and it's a process
[1:11:49] it's not God just dumping something on
[1:11:52] you he knows that you can't handle it
[1:11:58] he knows he knows you can't handle just
[1:12:01] God just stay on here here it is
[1:12:05] because as a baby you can choke a baby
[1:12:07] with what with meat you choke a baby
[1:12:12] but now hold on a minute
[1:12:14] the baby can still eat
[1:12:17] ing right
[1:12:19] but as he grows he gets more teeth
[1:12:22] so we can't eat he gets to where he can
[1:12:25] digest it well God's God's not like us
[1:12:28] he don't try to rush you into anything
[1:12:30] like we want to try you know we want our
[1:12:32] kids to be sports stars when they're
[1:12:33] three
[1:12:34] but God knows God knows that we got to
[1:12:38] grow you know he knows that we we've got
[1:12:41] to have a baby form Faith there in
[1:12:43] Romans 8 it says it says we receive the
[1:12:45] spirit of a spirit of adoption whereby
[1:12:47] we cry Daddy Daddy all right we don't
[1:12:50] receive adoption for a morning and
[1:12:51] receive the spirit of adoption where
[1:12:53] you're in line for adoption you got to
[1:12:56] come from the school Master to the Tudor
[1:12:58] and then that tutor is brother random
[1:13:00] says many times that Tudor goes to the
[1:13:02] father and says he's just like you
[1:13:05] or he goes to the father and says he's
[1:13:07] being disobedient
[1:13:11] the prodigal son was a son yes right
[1:13:14] okay he just backslid for a little while
[1:13:17] amen but
[1:13:20] so here's the process
[1:13:22] that we must go through
[1:13:24] bring up the
[1:13:26] the one you had up a minute ago with
[1:13:28] faith the foundation and justification
[1:13:29] and sanctification we're going to talk a
[1:13:31] little bit
[1:13:32] this morning
[1:13:34] about
[1:13:36] the new birth
[1:13:38] and the new birth you know as well as I
[1:13:40] do is one of the most ill-taught
[1:13:41] subjects brother Branham said it was Ill
[1:13:43] taught 50 years ago and I say it still
[1:13:45] he'll talk now
[1:13:46] okay
[1:13:48] because remember we got to come to a
[1:13:50] place that if we're born again and we
[1:13:52] look into the word of God and we're
[1:13:54] doing something contrary to what that
[1:13:55] word says we must repent
[1:13:58] or either you're not born again or not
[1:14:00] yet okay one of the two all right one
[1:14:02] other two and I know there's things that
[1:14:04] we do
[1:14:05] that and I'm going to try to explain
[1:14:06] some of this as we go we may just get
[1:14:09] into justification for about a few
[1:14:11] minutes here but we must start see look
[1:14:14] this does not put you in the body just
[1:14:16] because you're Justified right
[1:14:19] are Sanctified right
[1:14:21] still have spirits to deal with right
[1:14:23] still got them to deal with here but
[1:14:25] they're on the outside not the inside
[1:14:26] right right amen all right these are
[1:14:29] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:14:31] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[1:14:33] Holy Spirit and like brother Brown said
[1:14:34] it's not three different uh new births
[1:14:38] it's one new birth with three processes
[1:14:41] so you go through a process and I
[1:14:44] believe you can understand the new birth
[1:14:46] a lot better if you go through those
[1:14:47] three processes because everybody has to
[1:14:50] go through them amen
[1:14:52] everybody has to go through them all
[1:14:54] right so you're not exempt then what you
[1:14:57] have to do is we have to let the prophet
[1:15:00] of God break those down for us because
[1:15:03] he said no Baptist I can't go with you
[1:15:06] on just coming up and shaking hands and
[1:15:08] turning around and presenting them as
[1:15:10] you know as a new member
[1:15:12] no that don't drive nothing out right
[1:15:15] okay and the Baptist is very wrong when
[1:15:18] it's they say once saved always saved if
[1:15:20] you act like you did before right yeah
[1:15:23] it's like a guy said one time he said
[1:15:25] you know what to be saved is you was in
[1:15:27] the water drowning
[1:15:29] somebody picked you up and put you in
[1:15:32] the boat they didn't look down and say
[1:15:34] you're saved
[1:15:37] you're still drowning
[1:15:40] that's what the Baptist is says now you
[1:15:41] just believe
[1:15:44] well the guy that swimming is going I
[1:15:46] believe I'm going to die if you don't
[1:15:47] get me up out of this water but being
[1:15:49] saved is is you've been taken from what
[1:15:52] problem you were in situation and put in
[1:15:54] another one right okay so because
[1:15:57] remember justification is what
[1:16:02] not 360 that puts you back in the same
[1:16:05] direction I've heard some people say you
[1:16:06] got to do a 360. no 360 you just turned
[1:16:08] you right back in the same place you're
[1:16:10] going you got to do a 180 right
[1:16:12] walk away from what you were doing right
[1:16:15] yeah
[1:16:16] so faith
[1:16:18] is what we were what we were showing
[1:16:20] there it's a process three stages of the
[1:16:24] same Grace that puts you into the body
[1:16:28] all right now for a moment
[1:16:30] we can bring Genesis 1 in here Genesis 1
[1:16:33] 26 is right here
[1:16:38] not here
[1:16:39] because you're not in the body until you
[1:16:41] get right here right okay you're not
[1:16:43] your your foundation is Faith I have to
[1:16:47] believe that I'm part of that Genesis 1
[1:16:50] 26 family but now what I have to do
[1:16:52] though is Brother Richard I have to turn
[1:16:54] around and prove that
[1:16:56] by the way I live right
[1:16:58] I have to turn around and prove that by
[1:17:01] the way I live right yeah all right I
[1:17:04] can't keep saying I do this and that and
[1:17:06] the other and then I'm in the family of
[1:17:08] God no the characteristics of God
[1:17:12] your walk your talk and everything has
[1:17:14] got to be different okay different okay
[1:17:17] right because justification we're going
[1:17:20] to read what the prophet said here even
[1:17:21] in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:17:23] he proves that you got to go through
[1:17:26] these three stages of grace before you
[1:17:28] get the virtues so before we get the
[1:17:30] verses of God we got to understand that
[1:17:32] either we are born again and we can
[1:17:34] start on our journey or we're not born
[1:17:37] again and we just had an experience
[1:17:40] right now amen we're not born again we
[1:17:43] just had an experience and there's no
[1:17:45] way you can do that
[1:17:47] without having the new birth there's no
[1:17:50] way you can can grow in virtue in all
[1:17:52] those temperatures without having that
[1:17:53] Foundation but you know what it's got to
[1:17:56] start with believing yeah
[1:17:58] faith is believing
[1:18:03] believing what the word right right I
[1:18:05] want some man talk the word you got to
[1:18:07] believe in the word of God
[1:18:09] all right
[1:18:10] and that's why we had to have a prophet
[1:18:12] because some of those teachers taught us
[1:18:15] things that weren't right
[1:18:18] yeah father son Holy Ghost and all the
[1:18:20] Trinity and all that stuff and you know
[1:18:22] it's okay to do this and it's okay to do
[1:18:24] that no it's not the prophet of God
[1:18:26] brought all that together didn't bring
[1:18:28] us a new new birth right right amen he
[1:18:30] brought the same New Birth that they had
[1:18:33] on the day of Pentecost if not it was a
[1:18:35] false prophet exactly right amen he
[1:18:37] brought the same New Birth not just
[1:18:39] believe you're in the message
[1:18:41] the devil believes is in the message
[1:18:42] actually the devil is in the message
[1:18:46] he got here to church before some of you
[1:18:48] late people did yeah
[1:18:58] see that's where you got to go back to
[1:18:59] you say well I have them have a problem
[1:19:01] brother Graham should be here 20 minutes
[1:19:02] for service pray read your Bible and
[1:19:05] study
[1:19:06] then you come to service right time
[1:19:08] church starts and you go I didn't get
[1:19:10] anything yeah you didn't you didn't get
[1:19:11] nothing
[1:19:12] because you didn't do what you're
[1:19:14] supposed to do right
[1:19:16] right see that goes back to believing
[1:19:17] you don't believe what the prophet said
[1:19:19] see watch all these things you become an
[1:19:22] unbeliever if you keep you keep putting
[1:19:24] it down
[1:19:25] you show that yourself you're an
[1:19:27] unbeliever but
[1:19:29] doing
[1:19:31] not doing what he said all right so now
[1:19:33] number two let's go to number two
[1:19:35] and we'll come back to that but
[1:19:36] everybody see this doesn't put you in
[1:19:38] the body this doesn't put you in the
[1:19:39] body this does
[1:19:41] but you got to start with faith to
[1:19:44] believe you're Justified you got to
[1:19:46] start with faith to believe you're
[1:19:47] Sanctified so brother Brown's absolutely
[1:19:49] true when he says You must start with
[1:19:51] faith I believe
[1:19:55] I don't I didn't believe I believe I
[1:19:58] believe that God
[1:20:00] took the sins that I did
[1:20:02] and did away with them
[1:20:07] now the devil's going to remind you of
[1:20:09] them
[1:20:10] you may drive by the place that you did
[1:20:12] descending
[1:20:13] you may sometimes look at the place you
[1:20:16] did descending yeah
[1:20:18] but God
[1:20:20] can't remember them I have to believe
[1:20:23] that the sins that I had before I asked
[1:20:26] him to save me are gone
[1:20:29] and people they'll haunt you till the
[1:20:31] day if you don't say if you don't say
[1:20:33] God you promised
[1:20:36] you promised you'd do away with my sins
[1:20:38] if I if I ask you to forgive me
[1:20:41] and you got to believe that he did it
[1:20:45] because remember we got to stand sinless
[1:20:46] before him the only way wingstand
[1:20:49] sinless before him is to know that we
[1:20:50] put them all in the sea of his
[1:20:52] forgetfulness that's right never the
[1:20:55] Bible says to be remembered again
[1:20:57] but now look in justification though
[1:21:00] you're going to keep doing it
[1:21:02] because the unclean spirit that made you
[1:21:04] do it that's why you got to keep getting
[1:21:06] forgiveness that's right that's right
[1:21:07] that's right justification that unclean
[1:21:09] spirit's still there if you were
[1:21:10] drinking and you're still drinking
[1:21:11] you're just Justified right
[1:21:14] smoking and still smoking you will
[1:21:16] justify it you cannot be Sanctified I'm
[1:21:19] telling you by the word of God the
[1:21:20] prophet's message you cannot be
[1:21:22] Sanctified we'll talk about that this
[1:21:23] afternoon you can't be Sanctified and be
[1:21:26] cussing smoking drinking running around
[1:21:27] with women living in morally there's no
[1:21:30] way so just say look hey if I'm still
[1:21:31] doing it thank God you forgive me of my
[1:21:34] past sins that's right
[1:21:35] that's right right bro Tim you got to
[1:21:37] come to that and nail that thing down
[1:21:39] and say God I know you forgive me for
[1:21:40] that now let's work on the thing that I
[1:21:43] got to get rid of
[1:21:44] to not do that again
[1:21:48] that's just the way it is because
[1:21:49] remember the unclean Spirit goes out at
[1:21:52] sanctification the unclean spirit that
[1:21:53] made you do those things yes yes it's
[1:21:55] got to go out of you but you got to fill
[1:21:58] it with something right amen or that
[1:22:00] puppy will come right back and he'll
[1:22:03] bring some good religious and Devils
[1:22:05] with him this time and he'll put you in
[1:22:06] church and you'll still do the things
[1:22:08] out there that's what's wrong with the
[1:22:10] church in the eye
[1:22:11] Metro churches of the hour there's too
[1:22:13] much of that junk still going on
[1:22:16] secret centers
[1:22:18] all right let's read number two and then
[1:22:20] we'll I feel we need to stop here and
[1:22:22] then we'll uh this afternoon we'll we'll
[1:22:24] start on justification start on and
[1:22:27] sanification of baptismal Holy Ghost but
[1:22:29] you must be born again look this is this
[1:22:32] is another quote paragraph 131 from
[1:22:34] statue of perfect man first you must be
[1:22:36] born again
[1:22:38] then when you're born again
[1:22:40] you have faith you believe the word
[1:22:43] until you're born again you'll argue
[1:22:46] against it
[1:22:50] if you're just religiously inclined
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:53] and you got a A little human knowledge
[1:22:56] that you should do right
[1:22:58] you'll never be able to agree upon the
[1:23:01] word of God
[1:23:02] you'll never do it you got to be born
[1:23:05] again
[1:23:06] and born again it produces
[1:23:09] all right then after
[1:23:12] that's right here f-a-i-t-h she's
[1:23:13] pointing to us his chart
[1:23:15] then you're just in position of growing
[1:23:18] right right
[1:23:20] now a lot of people go up to the Altar
[1:23:22] and pray and say Lord forgive me and a
[1:23:24] great experience of sanctification comes
[1:23:26] upon them and things and you have a
[1:23:28] great time get up to the altar shouting
[1:23:31] you go back say bless God I got it no
[1:23:33] you just started to a place where you
[1:23:36] can grow right you ain't done nothing
[1:23:38] yet see the only thing you've done is
[1:23:40] just laid the foundation right now
[1:23:42] you're going to build a house
[1:23:45] and you pour the foundation say boy I
[1:23:47] got her see you got the foundation to
[1:23:49] build your house on yeah now you got to
[1:23:52] build the house right right okay now
[1:23:54] there's where the thing comes in this
[1:23:56] morning we're going to talk about now
[1:23:57] all right a house this Foundation is
[1:23:59] first what is the foundation of
[1:24:02] Christianity right
[1:24:04] so if you're a Christian here's your
[1:24:05] foundation right faith in the word of
[1:24:07] God Amen that's your foundation then you
[1:24:11] begin to grow
[1:24:13] okay so you can't grow without without
[1:24:14] being born again then you start you
[1:24:17] begin to add to this Foundation see when
[1:24:19] you become a new creation or a new
[1:24:20] creature in Christ you start at Faith
[1:24:23] that's why I say everybody starts at the
[1:24:25] same level amen amen amen everybody
[1:24:27] starts at the same level God's not a
[1:24:28] respecter of persons he starts it's the
[1:24:30] same same level so now let me read this
[1:24:33] one more quote because brother Brown in
[1:24:35] church order
[1:24:37] 1958 he explains
[1:24:40] a little bit about justification
[1:24:42] sanctification then what we'll do is
[1:24:43] this afternoon we'll back up
[1:24:45] and speak on it watch this
[1:24:47] we believe in justification by faith
[1:24:49] Romans 5 1. we believe that after a
[1:24:53] person being justified by faith he has
[1:24:55] peace with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:57] okay
[1:25:01] see that's
[1:25:02] that's what we got to understand too see
[1:25:04] it if you're truly Justified you are to
[1:25:07] glorified we know that we'll talk about
[1:25:08] that maybe later on
[1:25:10] but in in baby form justifications the
[1:25:12] way I like to call it baby form
[1:25:14] justification if you're if God forgives
[1:25:15] you your sins and you get killed
[1:25:17] tomorrow you're going to heaven
[1:25:19] everybody okay with that you're going to
[1:25:21] heaven you you've had your past sins
[1:25:23] forgiven you're going to heaven because
[1:25:25] you have been justified by God but now
[1:25:27] you're not in here
[1:25:30] you're not in the bride you're going to
[1:25:31] be given eternal life at the white
[1:25:33] Throne judgment you're still going to
[1:25:34] have to prove
[1:25:36] your words to God
[1:25:39] amen but now if you get Justified and
[1:25:42] then two years later
[1:25:43] you're still Justified
[1:25:46] you have made the word of God of none
[1:25:48] effect and you're going to hell
[1:25:51] right amen that's the way we believe it
[1:25:54] here we believe that after a person
[1:25:56] being justified by faith he has peace
[1:25:58] with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's
[1:26:00] possible that this same person could
[1:26:02] have habits such as drinking smoking
[1:26:04] doing things that he should not do
[1:26:05] filthy habits of the flesh
[1:26:08] right okay got it right
[1:26:10] but you but from here back you've been
[1:26:12] forgiven yeah all right but you still
[1:26:14] got those habits right we'll get into
[1:26:17] that a little bit more this afternoon
[1:26:18] then then we believe that the blood of
[1:26:21] Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for
[1:26:24] the service of the Lord and that's we
[1:26:27] believe in sanctification according to
[1:26:28] Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus said
[1:26:30] that he might sanctify the people with
[1:26:32] his own blood suffered without the gate
[1:26:35] and we believe that sanctification is
[1:26:37] taught in the New Testament and meant
[1:26:39] for the Believers through the New
[1:26:41] Testament age which we're now living and
[1:26:44] we also believe that after that person
[1:26:46] has been Sanctified unclean habits has
[1:26:49] gone from that person amen right there's
[1:26:52] sanctification not because you quit
[1:26:54] these things you're born again nope
[1:26:55] sorry it's sanctification he is a
[1:26:59] Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:27:02] his habits are gone we believe that then
[1:27:05] he is a candidate for the baptism of the
[1:27:08] Holy Spirit yes which comes as a filling
[1:27:11] of the believer then when the Believers
[1:27:13] just as many times I've taught it like
[1:27:15] picking up a glass
[1:27:17] right right picks up a glass
[1:27:20] God picks up the glass
[1:27:22] right picks up a glass out of chicken
[1:27:24] yard now you don't want to drink it
[1:27:25] right now right no right justification
[1:27:28] is picking it up
[1:27:29] God picks it up he picks the glass up
[1:27:32] he's still dirty but he has a purpose
[1:27:35] for that glass that glass can be filled
[1:27:38] with pure water all right ready for use
[1:27:41] to use it with a purpose and heart right
[1:27:44] that's what God does to the center he's
[1:27:46] still filthy
[1:27:49] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ in other words sanctifies
[1:27:52] the compound word which means clean and
[1:27:54] set aside for service the Old Testament
[1:27:56] the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it
[1:27:57] will set aside for service so what'd he
[1:27:59] do he takes that glass and he cleans it
[1:28:01] out right
[1:28:02] right
[1:28:03] but still not full of anything it's not
[1:28:06] being used for the purpose that it was
[1:28:08] meant to be all right amen
[1:28:09] we believe that the holy spirit is
[1:28:11] putting the same vessel
[1:28:13] in service
[1:28:14] fill it full of good clean water
[1:28:17] that the holy spirit is not another step
[1:28:19] of Grace but more of the same Grace that
[1:28:23] fills the believer to the extent whether
[1:28:25] it's signs and wonders such as Apostolic
[1:28:27] gifts spoken of in First Corinthians 12
[1:28:29] manifest himself through this believer
[1:28:31] when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up
[1:28:33] the gifts I believe that the scripture
[1:28:36] teaches that gifts and callings are
[1:28:37] without repentance that when we are born
[1:28:39] in this world we are sent here by by one
[1:28:41] purpose that is of god and that before
[1:28:44] we are even become adults while we're
[1:28:46] yet children the gift that we have of
[1:28:49] God is in us then because remember gifts
[1:28:52] and callings are without repentance
[1:28:53] remember Elvis Presley had a gift
[1:28:56] he had a gift of God
[1:28:58] that's right brother Brown said he could
[1:28:59] have had a purpose with God but he sold
[1:29:01] his soul for a fleet of Cadillacs he
[1:29:03] made a choice that's right and used that
[1:29:06] anointing to put people in hell that's
[1:29:08] right man
[1:29:09] that's right sorry just the way it is
[1:29:12] I believe that scripture teaches the
[1:29:13] gifts and calls are without repentance
[1:29:15] we were standing here for one purpose
[1:29:16] that's of God that's before we're even
[1:29:17] become adults when we're children the
[1:29:19] gift that we have of God is in us then
[1:29:21] and only the filling of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:24] puts those gifts into operation amen but
[1:29:27] we have them in the beginning such as
[1:29:28] teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of
[1:29:30] tongues nine spiritual gifts according
[1:29:31] to First Corinthians 12. now we believe
[1:29:33] that these gifts are in operation today
[1:29:35] as they should be in every local church
[1:29:39] amen all right
[1:29:41] so three stages of Grace We're gonna
[1:29:43] talk about this afternoon justification
[1:29:45] we're going to break it down you say
[1:29:47] well that's simple but you know what if
[1:29:48] you're not born again if you just think
[1:29:50] you're a Believer I want you to either
[1:29:52] know you're not or you are or you're not
[1:29:54] right I wish to God like brother Dale
[1:29:56] said let's stand I wish to God we did
[1:29:58] realize we were lost
[1:30:00] right because some people you look and
[1:30:01] they've never had an experience they've
[1:30:02] never been to the altar they've never
[1:30:04] cried they've never they've never moved
[1:30:06] maybe you're not born again right
[1:30:09] maybe you're not born again maybe you
[1:30:11] know I I pray for God to save my soul
[1:30:13] all the time right you say well I think
[1:30:15] I was born again 50 years ago well so do
[1:30:17] I'm 20 or 15 years ago but
[1:30:21] the desire in my heart though is that I
[1:30:22] know I'm not the same place that I was
[1:30:24] but I'm not in a place I should be right
[1:30:26] right it's like the uh like the old
[1:30:28] black sister said you know I'm not what
[1:30:30] a
[1:30:31] ought to be but I'm sure definitely not
[1:30:32] what I used to be all right so we're in
[1:30:35] a process of believing amen amen you
[1:30:37] love the Lord
[1:30:41] what we're saying
[1:30:43] what is it
[1:30:45] doing that for me
[1:30:47] we're living by faith
[1:30:49] that's what we have to do as a Christian
[1:30:51] we must live by the faith it's not it's
[1:30:54] got to be the faith we'll talk about
[1:30:55] this afternoon there's an anchor
[1:30:57] somewhere you got to put that anchor
[1:30:59] down and say I believe if it's the Bible
[1:31:01] you need to believe in what it all says
[1:31:02] now what part of it says whatever bit of
[1:31:04] it says all right now just pieces of it
[1:31:07] that you like
[1:31:08] the devil likes pieces of it
[1:31:11] amen yes he does but he don't like all
[1:31:13] of it right
[1:31:15] go ahead
[1:31:16] if you have a name
[1:31:35] my sins are gone
[1:31:38] they're underneath the blood on the
[1:31:41] cross of calvary
[1:31:45] this darkness is from God
[1:31:48] in the sea of dark forgetfulness that's
[1:31:52] good enough for me praise God my sins
[1:31:57] are gone
[1:31:59] yes
[1:32:36] praise God
[1:32:38] my sins are gone
[1:32:41] when Satan comes to take me Christ to
[1:32:45] make me down I say my sins you should
[1:32:51] just sanctify our brother raise him up
[1:32:54] from this in Jesus name
[1:32:59] my sins are gone
[1:33:02] they're underneath the blood on the
[1:33:05] cross of Calvary
[1:33:07] before you leave everybody up and get
[1:33:10] one prayer cloth for your home and put
