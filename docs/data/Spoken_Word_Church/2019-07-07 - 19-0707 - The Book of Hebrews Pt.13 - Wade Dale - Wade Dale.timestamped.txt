[0:00] stop the process anytime you wish you
[0:03] still are a free moral agent with God
[0:06] you can never ever take away your free
[0:09] moral agency never don't tell me you can
[0:13] because even Adam did some things if he
[0:14] really was supposed to do and he was a
[0:16] little horny heat well we weren't
[0:17] warning him but he had the Holy Ghost in
[0:19] his soul and he did some things that
[0:22] were pretty rough and so today okay so
[0:25] let's just don't product it's not the
[0:29] statue of a perfect man if a statue
[0:33] moves it's not a statue right if a
[0:39] statue but a stature has growth
[0:41] development or height developments that
[0:43] jerk not static to you and you can stop
[0:49] anytime you want then you say when the
[0:53] Holy Ghost in your soul yeah last night
[1:00] I was thinking about this brother Ramsey
[1:03] remember the preacher birthday with the
[1:05] morning in Christian nature yeah so I
[1:08] think reaching the more he got a spirit
[1:10] on me when out started drinking but I
[1:13] will tell you something he didn't lose
[1:15] his salvation
[1:16] he just got a demon on him that overtook
[1:19] that man but you know why God didn't
[1:21] label it for a long time back since my
[1:22] flavor brother Graham Stig's doctor took
[1:23] him home showing what the margins name
[1:25] so see God's gracious and if we do
[1:29] things that seemingly is kind of like we
[1:31] were talking about suicide you know and
[1:34] then and the denominational world you
[1:35] commit suicide your hell I mean it's
[1:37] just a straight cube to hell but we know
[1:40] that's not right right we know that's
[1:42] not right what because you didn't do it
[1:45] in your soul you did it in an anointing
[1:47] on your spirit and your humanity that
[1:49] made you do what you did I
[1:51] pretty much
[1:57] okay now we're a mission of these is
[2:00] there's no more offering for sin listen
[2:02] when you get born again in your soul you
[2:04] don't have to go back through that form
[2:06] of justification I was hoping we'd get
[2:08] into that last night but we couldn't you
[2:10] don't have to go back to that form of
[2:11] sanctification you got to move out of
[2:14] that mental realm because it's finished
[2:16] it's done now
[2:17] where does your growth come from it
[2:19] comes from what's that's inside because
[2:21] the life is in that Steve word that you
[2:23] take in your soul but you gotta let it
[2:25] work out or you can stop it but we have
[2:30] the full work so that's really no excuse
[2:32] for us to stop it
[2:33] so having therefore boldness to enter
[2:37] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[2:39] by a new and living way which he has
[2:42] consecrated for us like I told you
[2:45] before I read that quote last seconds of
[2:48] people in Kentucky they looked a little
[2:50] cross-eyed you ever once a wild where I
[2:52] know them that that Jesus never come to
[2:54] bring you an inheritance he did no no he
[2:57] does not come to bring you an interview
[2:58] new he came a way to get you back to
[3:02] your inheritance a new and living way
[3:04] which have constantly consecrated
[3:07] yourself so that we can become free but
[3:09] he to bring you an inheritance if he
[3:11] brought to an inheritance they developed
[3:12] the son of Jesus came on earth your
[3:15] inheritance was before the foundation of
[3:17] the world you just didn't get back to it
[3:19] because of the watch because of the same
[3:21] curse I believe that's in hearing him
[3:25] and I think 61 is the very quote that
[3:28] are you the brother God says no he did
[3:31] not bring your inheritance
[3:32] he made a way to get you back to your
[3:34] memory by a new and living way which he
[3:37] has consecrated for us through the veil
[3:39] that is to say his flesh he had to die
[3:42] human being
[3:43] and having an High Priest over the house
[3:46] of God let us draw near with a true
[3:49] heart a true soul in full assurance of
[3:53] faith having our soul sprinkled from an
[3:56] evil conscience so it's done away in the
[3:58] soul we're trying to work on the spirit
[4:01] guy and our bodies washed
[4:04] water now that doesn't mean you go take
[4:06] a bath and you fine brother okay that's
[4:10] washing of the water of the word pure
[4:12] word pure water plants let us hold fast
[4:16] the profession of our faith without
[4:18] wavering Rhydian let's hold fast the
[4:24] profession of our faith without wavering
[4:26] for his faith he is faithful that
[4:29] promised in other words he got it
[4:30] promised it we put all of our faith in
[4:32] him and let us consider one another to
[4:35] provoke unto love and to good work oh
[4:39] this Oh Oh
[4:51] if you end the message this doesn't
[4:53] apply to you anymore I'm gonna read you
[4:59] the bottom and whatever you do with it
[5:02] that's your business not forsaking the
[5:04] assembling of ourselves together as the
[5:06] manner of some is but exhorting one
[5:09] another and so much more as you see the
[5:13] Day approaching I'm telling you if
[5:14] you're not going to church more than you
[5:16] were back ten years ago you're lost you
[5:19] do not have the baptism of the Holy
[5:21] Ghost how to look at me hi everyone in
[5:22] the interface you do not because this
[5:25] scripture right here and so much the
[5:27] more as you see what day of protein the
[5:31] day when we're not going to be able to
[5:33] assemble like this you better packing up
[5:35] in your storehouse to where you can't
[5:36] get the turn you can teach your family
[5:39] at home but you can't do it sitting at
[5:43] home I'm just read the Bible look for if
[5:49] we sin willfully see if you don't
[5:53] believe this around here you're standing
[5:54] willfully now sinning willfully that
[5:56] makes you lost if you sin willfully
[6:00] after that we have received the
[6:02] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[6:05] no more sacrifice for sins in other
[6:09] words there is no sacrifice for that are
[6:11] you knowing and you don't do it but a
[6:15] certain fearful looking for of judgment
[6:17] and fiery indignation which shall devour
[6:20] the adversaries thank God for that
[6:23] excuse me he that despised Moses law
[6:27] died without mercy under to bear
[6:29] witnesses
[6:32] so Moses was a man of the day and even
[6:36] though you say well that was just the
[6:37] law they live by they live they did live
[6:41] by the night okay he they despised Moses
[6:45] law died without mercy under two or
[6:48] three witnesses of how much sorer
[6:51] punishment
[6:53] oh he's magnified it now of how much
[6:57] sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be
[7:01] thought worthy
[7:02] that trodden under the foot of the son
[7:05] of God no word if they tried Moses being
[7:07] a human if they tried Moses his message
[7:12] and they didn't make it
[7:14] they died without mercy how much more
[7:17] sore punishment they do the same thing
[7:20] when we read the Bible and God tells us
[7:23] what to do and God tells us what to do
[7:27] and we tried and underfoot the Son of
[7:32] God how much more is that Moses was just
[7:38] letters on the page son of God was a man
[7:42] guarding human flesh talking to us
[7:44] trying to get us to do right and have
[7:47] counted the blood of the Covenant
[7:48] wherewith he was sanctified and holy
[7:51] play in other words you're saying he's
[7:53] not got enough for me to live the way
[7:56] I'm supposed to live but you know you're
[7:59] wrong he does and Paul saying you're
[8:02] wrong
[8:02] and have done despite unto the spirit of
[8:04] grace is asking a question for we know
[8:07] him that said that said then just
[8:10] belongs under maintenance in that gun
[8:12] I will recompense that the Lord and
[8:15] again the Lord shall judge his people it
[8:19] is a fearful thing to fall in the hands
[8:21] of the Living God the call to
[8:24] remembrance the former days in which
[8:25] after you were illuminated in other
[8:28] words an afterthought after the word
[8:29] comes you endured a great fight of
[8:32] affliction partly whilst you were made
[8:35] occasions dog both by reproach and
[8:37] affliction both talking by coming into
[8:39] Christ and then you know what he was
[8:43] partly to blame for that Paul from Paul
[8:48] persecuted the Christians before he got
[8:51] converted so he's partly to blame for
[8:53] this for he had compassion of me and my
[8:57] bond and took joyful the spoiling of
[9:00] your good knowing in yourself that you
[9:02] have
[9:02] I'm better than a third sentence in
[9:04] other words Paul saying you guys that
[9:06] are bound to me same way we're talking
[9:08] about now though people that are bound
[9:10] to this message we have to put up with
[9:11] all the spoiling of people saying this
[9:14] and people saying that all these
[9:16] different things but we know the message
[9:19] the truck knowing in yourself that you
[9:22] haven't having a better name during
[9:23] substance Matthew 24 those who endure to
[9:29] the end shall be safe
[9:32] that's not a way that for your
[9:34] confidence that's what Satan doing right
[9:37] now he is tearing down the confidence of
[9:39] the people in this message what he's
[9:42] doing right I ain't doing it from within
[9:48] so that's not away therefore your
[9:51] confidence which has great recompense of
[9:53] reward where you have need of patience
[9:59] if I take your hand though I mean you
[10:03] tell me that this morning coming up you
[10:05] gotta have patience those who endure to
[10:07] the end why can't I have it right now
[10:12] you know what if you and I don't want
[10:14] something as an adult we wait right
[10:18] we have patience we wait get behind the
[10:33] 40 face it same way with God
[10:36] you get crying and crying and crying he
[10:37] said shut up I'm gonna let you go a
[10:40] little bit longer okay you gonna learn
[10:42] this thing where we have need of
[10:44] patience and that after you have done
[10:46] the will of God that word right there
[10:50] after you have done the will of God you
[10:56] might receive the promise that's what I
[10:59] say that by going you know you stay with
[11:00] one that you the Bible tell us what
[11:04] today
[11:04] we don't do it and we worry why we're
[11:06] not getting results let's go check
[11:10] ourselves up when we study in and out
[11:13] when we pray enough we'll be coming to
[11:14] church with a wonderful attitude that
[11:16] God's going to meet us here are that we
[11:18] set at home ago ll-look watch him
[11:20] because my big talker so I just I love
[11:26] that I love the Internet and I love that
[11:27] world YouTube but I'll never stay home
[11:31] and watch the service explain something
[11:33] true that will never happen
[11:35] all right stick yes somehow to work like
[11:41] the curtain that he knows he has to work
[11:44] one Sunday but you know what he don't
[11:46] miss three or four he comes do you
[11:48] understand what I'm saying sometimes we
[11:50] have circumvented he said well let's
[11:51] jump you cut and dry it is good and drop
[11:53] so he's working towards something we're
[11:55] all working toward something all right
[11:56] we just start you don't feel good hey I
[12:01] don't feel good either
[12:02] come on you use those circumstances for
[12:07] a long time I come here to learn
[12:09] I come here to teach you did not come
[12:11] anything by this point you know I I come
[12:13] here with the dual purpose and there's
[12:16] no today we'll talking last night we are
[12:17] no greater than nobody else don't you
[12:19] ever think that that me and brother
[12:21] daily the one and he's never and I'll
[12:22] never predict it I don't think they were
[12:24] up here and y'all are down here no no
[12:29] yes because we're no different the body
[12:32] of Christ only we have a gift that where
[12:34] God can speak to me maybe where he
[12:37] couldn't speak to brother on the same
[12:38] way
[12:39] okay well I'm saying the same way
[12:42] because what defender is just an
[12:45] important manner
[12:46] I got a hangnail on that finger
[12:47] it was so short this little hangout took
[12:50] a couple days off work did come to
[12:53] church nobody it hurt because they don't
[12:57] tell my reaching get something I hit
[12:59] that we don't want that thing that's
[13:00] important I'll everybody every person is
[13:02] important in the body of Christ we have
[13:08] need of patience that after you have
[13:10] done the will of God you might receive
[13:12] the problem then what is his will his
[13:14] will is his word where you had a little
[13:17] while and he that shall come will come
[13:19] and will not tarry don't that mean you
[13:22] you say oh my god what words he coming
[13:25] that somebody in now they just shall
[13:29] live by he said yeah now the just shall
[13:34] live by faith but if any man draw back
[13:36] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[13:39] but we are not of them they grow back
[13:41] them to perdition but of them that
[13:44] believe to the saving of the soul and
[13:46] then he goes into Hebrews 11 faith is
[13:49] the substance of things hoped for
[13:52] [Music]
[14:00] I'm trying to get out of here instead
[14:03] get the boobs a little good everybody
[14:05] here today or bless your heart and
[14:11] hopefully have a good week and you
[14:14] definitely got a good start of another
[14:16] oh yeah today being the first day of the
[14:20] week okay so now let's turn to we got
[14:25] well you or look Hebrews 10 we're going
[14:27] to we got down to his enemies made a
[14:31] switch to make Ryan from doing them from
[14:44] I one offering he has perfected forehead
[14:46] now this is something we were coming a
[14:48] little bit last night the Bible study
[14:49] for those of you that weren't here that
[14:51] would 51 of us care less 9 so we keep
[14:54] doing this a lot of have enough in the
[14:56] sanctuary but no copier no no no Brioni
[15:02] but not all wait a minute I'll find a
[15:05] quote for the brownie
[15:08] good when Brandis his ticket no now we
[15:13] have a full house and that was great
[15:14] thank you everybody for coming so but
[15:19] but why what I'll bring up perfected
[15:21] forever them that are sanctified all
[15:24] right and then we talked about
[15:25] justification sanctification baptism the
[15:27] Holy Ghost
[15:28] like what brother doesn't call me about
[15:30] let's just keep going we're out the Holy
[15:32] Ghost also of the witness to us we're
[15:35] after they hear saying that look you got
[15:38] to get to where he says those who he's
[15:39] justified is already glorified because
[15:42] that sanctification is not just the
[15:44] unclean spirit going out because you
[15:47] know Holy Ghost off with the witness to
[15:48] us so he's talking about a daily
[15:51] sanctification it's not just you get
[15:52] sanctified you get the Holy Ghost
[15:54] that's not what he saved because look he
[15:57] has perfected you're not perfected until
[16:00] you received the baptism of the Holy
[16:02] Ghost you are heading toward perfection
[16:05] but you're not perfect in its
[16:06] sanctification baby born now the iodine
[16:09] daily part
[16:10] yes you are you're already born again
[16:12] you're stealing in they can't get in God
[16:14] can't get out what a wonderful thing
[16:16] alright so he's working in
[16:19] sanctification on the outer outer outer
[16:22] man are the middleman for by one
[16:24] offering yet perfected bringing in their
[16:25] sanctify where the Holy Ghost offer the
[16:28] witness to us for after that he had said
[16:31] before this is the Covenant that I will
[16:35] make with them after those days that the
[16:38] Lord I will put my law in their hearts
[16:40] around their inward being because then
[16:45] the Old Testament remember we've been
[16:46] through this months months months in the
[16:48] Old Testament God can not dwell in their
[16:51] soul he could annoy them okay but now
[16:55] he's talking about that another covenant
[16:57] when Jesus raised the company in Matthew
[17:00] and says this is the
[17:02] New Testament in my blood right so the
[17:05] New Testament in his blood was and he
[17:07] took our sins away and we don't have to
[17:09] go back to the well Paul talking about
[17:13] the period priesthood made sacrifices
[17:16] cry student made one sacrifice you don't
[17:18] make no more right he's done he's then
[17:21] perfected forever of those who are just
[17:23] are sanctified all right this is the
[17:26] covenant I will make with them after
[17:27] those days says the Lord I will put my
[17:29] laws into their heart and into their
[17:31] minds will I write them right and their
[17:35] sins and iniquities where I remember no
[17:37] more thing I want you to remember that
[17:40] God is telling us this this we know one
[17:44] thing this comes from the Old Testament
[17:47] so God's going to do that to Israel -
[17:50] God's going to take the 144,000 through
[17:52] justification sanctification in the
[17:54] baptism and they're going to be preached
[17:57] - just like you are don't think how to
[17:59] receive the holy go right but now
[18:01] remember position-wise they're not
[18:03] bribed so don't don't get that messed up
[18:05] their service because they were divorced
[18:08] or put away by God in the Old Testament
[18:09] and he made us you can't have to live
[18:13] beyond popular belief and some of the
[18:16] people in imagine if you don't need to
[18:17] act you know what a revelation then it
[18:24] has to be and their sins and iniquities
[18:26] where I remember the war right cuz I've
[18:31] been reading I went back like I tell you
[18:33] many Chronicles and kings and now I'm in
[18:36] the book of Esther but Chronicles and
[18:39] Kings man 1 King had come in and he'd
[18:41] tear all the Groves then put them back I
[18:45] mean you know go back to Temple worship
[18:47] he had died his son and raised up and
[18:50] he'd be he praise Him grooms all back up
[18:54] again
[18:54] start sacrificing his kids to Moloch in
[18:59] other words you know what that was they
[19:01] would sacrifice their children to
[19:02] appease done and would literally take
[19:04] their children's dolmen fire to appease
[19:06] the gods were God
[19:09] so you see what I may have their sins
[19:11] and iniquities are out a lot of remember
[19:13] two more there's going to be an Old
[19:15] Testament people that's going to be
[19:17] saved
[19:19] okay so they're God's people God can't
[19:23] forget Israel that's why he's going to
[19:25] save that 144,000 at the end time after
[19:29] we're gone at the end he's going to save
[19:31] them sanctify them filled with the Holy
[19:33] Ghost and they will be servants because
[19:36] they lost the position of bride okay now
[19:40] remember you and I can never be service
[19:42] because we're the life we're the life of
[19:44] Christ so we're not serving where we are
[19:48] his wife I don't want to hit on that
[19:52] maybe later on upstairs on the Seventh
[19:55] Seal we must not see ourselves as bride
[19:58] anymore there was a bride in the church
[20:05] ages God married a bride in the church
[20:09] age but in revelations 19 when we come
[20:15] back into the Millennium after all this
[20:18] is done and over with
[20:20] we are his wife there's a big difference
[20:24] in a bride and a life big difference now
[20:27] you got to be a bride first but now you
[20:31] look at me and tell me that your wife
[20:33] it's the same person you married no
[20:35] she's not right when you first got
[20:38] married you fumble around like you had
[20:40] three left hand I got one and man
[20:45] freedom will when people say you're
[20:46] left-handed was it yeah we did thank
[20:49] left-handed huh
[20:50] but you did come on people when you got
[20:52] married you didn't know exactly what you
[20:54] want once you know exactly what you
[20:56] wanted you're Bob bust and Tim but now
[20:59] you get a little bit of older and maybe
[21:01] cuz you can't hear as well as you used
[21:02] to or remember right
[21:05] 3j brother you don't even know you 40 in
[21:10] yes yes it's a sorry what hey Louise
[21:16] before you do poverty you're in close
[21:21] 39:39 next month this month
[21:24] Oh Lord I'll be married 40 years in
[21:27] October
[21:33] I'll release you to your mom now that
[21:39] Colombian came in so anyway let's get
[21:44] back um but anyway even in life remember
[21:46] a bride it's just like brother Dale's
[21:49] talking about one up that statue of a
[21:51] perfect man
[21:52] you started a ride and you go work your
[21:55] way up that statue a perfect man and
[21:56] when we come to a body change we're
[21:58] gonna be the life of Christ
[21:59] now sure you can keep saying proud
[22:01] people to catch some time you know
[22:02] cross-eyed what you mean we're not
[22:03] bright anymore we're not
[22:06] we started bright the word is life the
[22:10] Bible tells us where is why I'm not
[22:12] telling you anything different over
[22:13] revelation 19 says his wife had made her
[22:16] spouts ready so you do have something to
[22:19] do with it
[22:20] just like more come out Thank You bride
[22:25] right you do that you say well you know
[22:28] when you do come you terminology is well
[22:30] this is my new bride but you know you
[22:32] really do away with that wing when
[22:34] you've got bride and bridegroom that
[22:36] doesn't carry on very far into your
[22:37] marriage it becomes husband and wife and
[22:41] that's correct because the same thing
[22:43] with Christ I mean you've time the whole
[22:44] thing is that you're married to Christ
[22:46] when you become his wife because what I
[22:49] read well I've got the quotes so we can
[22:52] even a later upstairs she has his
[22:54] potential she knows what he wants to do
[22:58] with the word I same way with Jim
[23:02] you know many times and you know it too
[23:04] you'll be thinking the same thing and
[23:06] you'll both worked it out at the same
[23:07] time and you'll go oh I was just she
[23:10] said something the other day and so I'm
[23:11] just thinking the same identical thing
[23:13] well you know what that means then for
[23:14] communion there that's that's really
[23:16] supernatural same thing between Ivany
[23:20] before the fall there was a supernatural
[23:22] connection between Adam and Eve but
[23:24] where like I was telling them up in
[23:25] Kentucky Adam an evil co-equal before
[23:28] the fall people don't like to preach
[23:30] that read your Bible
[23:34] her name was not even till the fall of
[23:37] her name was Adam and she was co-equal
[23:42] with Adam before the fall
[23:45] okay then boning this poem and actually
[23:53] her part of her spirit came out of him
[23:54] and went into her so what what connect
[23:58] well what the world happens between us
[24:00] and Christ part of his spirit come down
[24:03] and go there nice smells I work and
[24:12] there's sands and iniquities will rival
[24:14] remember no more
[24:15] now we're remission of these is there's
[24:18] no more offering percent so you don't
[24:21] have in other words we were talking
[24:24] about last night you got to remember
[24:26] baby form justification is not flight
[24:28] the second form of justification we're
[24:31] brother man talk about a mysterious part
[24:33] now people were talking years and years
[24:35] of justification benefit message in
[24:37] panco
[24:37] well now justification just chucked off
[24:39] you pass in now the next form of
[24:43] justification doesn't just jump off your
[24:45] face then you pay sins are a checkup and
[24:50] you already have the holy ghost room
[24:52] there's nothing that counted against
[24:54] your soul you don't have to go back in
[24:57] and get your soul justify the second
[24:59] time or the third time no you're working
[25:02] on the second room
[25:05] the spirit around with what God's
[25:06] working on right now if you're born
[25:08] again you're not born again he's working
[25:11] on the inside guy to get it cleaned up
[25:13] and give it to holy go and if you have
[25:18] the bath minimal hookup then your soul
[25:19] your sealed person Luther with a sealed
[25:21] person he had smoked drank and dude
[25:22] thinks he did in his soul he did it in
[25:26] his spirit realm that was not enough
[25:29] preaching or background I got all that
[25:32] was looking at last night
[25:33] that's not he didn't have no background
[25:35] all he knew was that he received the
[25:38] Holy Ghost and wanted you to receive the
[25:40] Holy Ghost apart from the works of the
[25:42] Catholic Church that's all he had that's
[25:46] why I was a reformer he brought he
[25:48] reformed him reformed what perform skill
[25:50] dude really that changed the person that
[25:52] just tries to reform you and bring you
[25:54] out you know but he didn't have the Holy
[25:57] Ghost in his soul so he could you
[25:58] couldn't bother that so Luther never
[26:00] smoked a pipe and drank the beer and
[26:02] installed he stole never you said well
[26:04] well yeah I'm sure he had problems with
[26:06] that I'm sure you have problems with
[26:08] that back and forth he he's still Ward
[26:10] with that because Paul said the same
[26:11] thing to think I wouldn't not I do
[26:13] things I deal with not that's not at all
[26:15] so that's in this spit room that's the
[26:19] problem that we have we have a problem
[26:21] with your soul being God
[26:26] if you realize your soul was God and it
[26:29] does not sin can't sin won't sin never
[26:33] did it in the first place then there's
[26:36] your new birth but now you got to start
[26:38] working on that next guy now so I gotta
[26:41] the memory reason conscious and you do
[26:42] need to be just the fact they're
[26:44] justified it's what justified you're
[26:47] just you got to realize hey Matt about
[26:50] these dirty thoughts and I have in my
[26:51] life I used to have like still have them
[26:55] but I don't dwell on them like they used
[26:57] to so see Luther never had that part
[27:00] Luther never had the teaching to bring
[27:01] him to a true justification that the
[27:04] real he'll never did but I'll promise
[27:06] you one thing you bring Luther in here
[27:08] today and let him listen
[27:09] brother Dale talk about justification or
[27:12] listen to the passport by Sherman to my
[27:13] justification I'm guaranteed you would
[27:15] not keep him in his seat because the
[27:19] Holy Ghost inside of him with Clinton
[27:20] the little bit that he had and it will
[27:23] just be be a complete revelation so
[27:28] didn't brother Brandon say from the
[27:30] bride's realizes they have not realized
[27:33] in you what we're trying to do
[27:46] Ezekiel Supercross need some factor real
[27:51] well that was Christ in the church all
[27:55] down to the seven churches sure so he's
[28:00] they have to have the whole ethos of
[28:01] justification sanctification baptism of
[28:04] the Holy Ghost because I think the
[28:05] strikes in the truth for their age
[28:08] believe in Calamba sake globalism you
[28:12] know he was in a very dark age but he
[28:14] had life yes his life was the gospel at
[28:17] the time and Martin Luther's light was
[28:20] to bring a group of people out of the
[28:22] Catholic dogma and doctrine yeah and
[28:26] clicking the word that he had which was
[28:28] just a little small piece of the whole
[28:32] puzzle bait was you know what you go out
[28:35] there in the garden you put the seed in
[28:36] the ground when m2 shoots come up like
[28:38] this she said well that's not corn yet
[28:39] but you know why you cut it down it's
[28:43] got the life of the corn in those to
[28:45] talk to you you got to leave it alone
[28:47] and let it continue to grow and let the
[28:49] Sheep go up because the Lots in there
[28:52] but now these two things die they're
[28:54] very important Lutheran's very important
[28:56] that's the basis of all Christianity
[28:58] modern Christianity you understand when
[29:00] a man coming out of the Catholic Church
[29:02] the basis of all crit and he come from
[29:03] Luther and Wesley and Pentecost
[29:05] amen that's why brother Brennan had to
[29:08] come to tie up the loose ends that were
[29:10] still there because when Wesley came out
[29:11] of the Catholic Church he brought a lot
[29:13] of dogma with him because he didn't have
[29:16] any background Lord he didn't have
[29:18] nobody to teach him all he took what
[29:19] Scott was this you know say 20 Hail
[29:22] Marys and you know do the beat yourself
[29:25] and I love that movie I go back again if
[29:28] you ever want to see a good movie see
[29:29] the one
[29:30] Martin Luther that had clients his last
[29:34] night FBI mes fine Jeremy or one of us
[29:37] to brother pretty Joe the fight huh
[29:42] I need think they anyway being wait look
[29:44] it up because this is a really good
[29:45] movie because what it does it shows from
[29:47] lugar struggling struggling with what's
[29:51] inside of it and then do exactly what
[29:55] brother Brown said he said it wasn't it
[29:57] lugar I was reading it last night
[29:59] Luther it wasn't that he was so much a
[30:02] fanatic it's that he could hold his head
[30:05] above the fanaticism around evil in that
[30:07] movie Luther comes back into a town in
[30:10] there Bernie you see a Catholic Church
[30:12] on fire and they're throwing the priests
[30:14] out them out the door
[30:15] Luther run them is this stop and the guy
[30:19] turns around and said this is what you
[30:21] taught us to do so and in the hitting
[30:26] that what he was doing was is the people
[30:28] were taken to the fleshly emotion and he
[30:32] was trying to get him out of the
[30:33] Catholic Church spiritually and they
[30:36] will get him out physically so that was
[30:39] the terminal ending in C brown brown
[30:41] brain set up in the movie when he made
[30:43] at that time so no brother Graham didn't
[30:44] watch the movie bill and then you see
[30:47] that that he held his head above the
[30:49] fanaticism it was going on well don't
[30:51] you see that having the same thing right
[30:52] now
[30:53] there was fanaticism with everybody in
[30:55] every age okay
[31:01] they didn't have that think about that's
[31:04] what the profits well you got it you got
[31:06] to be careful saying that they had the
[31:08] word yeah they have a word for their day
[31:10] cuz they have the complete Bible the
[31:13] Bible was written by Ken Dayle and all
[31:14] those people about time a blueprint
[31:16] Wesley they compiled what we have well
[31:19] Amanda there's what you have in front of
[31:20] you
[31:21] Luther had parts of that so they were
[31:23] compiling the Bible and he could read
[31:25] the word but the analogy I always use
[31:28] and it works for me is is you take your
[31:30] hand and all I see right now is it's
[31:33] just random Kennard but now that doesn't
[31:35] negate everybody sitting in this
[31:37] building right I can only stay and
[31:40] canard because one I'm shielded but the
[31:44] words here the people there's thirty
[31:47] people in this room but I don't if I do
[31:49] this so that's why I'm done did God
[31:51] didn't literally blind Martin Luther's
[31:53] eyes but he only gave him enough to get
[31:54] out because he wasn't reformer the full
[31:57] word listen you don't want to did that
[32:00] are you sitting right here today because
[32:03] the plan of redemption is a whole plan
[32:06] not just a part plan Luthor could only
[32:09] bring a part wesley brought a part
[32:11] pentecost grown apart and then this
[32:13] message brings the fullness I want
[32:15] nothing to do this it does this and it
[32:17] does this and then see remember the pump
[32:19] boats open mouth so you can only Martin
[32:22] Luther come and crank the book over
[32:23] there looking see the just shall live by
[32:26] faith and you know what that was a
[32:28] revelation because for 1500 years they
[32:31] live by yeah
[32:34] Yeah right Catholic Church are you gonna
[32:38] do is pay you know Venus and all that so
[32:41] good so my name is I just said I'll
[32:43] never watch open
[32:49] let me let me back the tape up you you
[32:57] right God wanted to work in fullness in
[33:00] his church and he can only work in first
[33:02] immortally and was happy with that
[33:05] because it was the stop but the light
[33:07] within that stop we'll see what happened
[33:13] is in the ending when I don't get done
[33:15] with this but in in the first church
[33:17] ages even you know the seat had going to
[33:22] the ground
[33:23] we know that was Christ he had going to
[33:26] ground died so that we could come forth
[33:27] but truly the church had to go in the
[33:30] ground it not co-brother grounds then
[33:32] the true seed went in the ground and you
[33:36] can see it anymore cuz it's buried in
[33:38] the earth during the 59 years of dark
[33:43] ages they but they literally kill people
[33:45] remember when we went to the horse
[33:47] riders and all that you know then you
[33:49] had two shoots come out which is Martin
[33:51] Luther the just shall live by faith
[33:52] you know what that didn't look too
[33:53] promising but you know what that alive
[33:55] anything every seed that was going to be
[33:59] brought forth within them to stop two
[34:01] little shoots coming out of the ground
[34:04] when you plant an apple tree you put a
[34:08] seed in the ground every Apple it's
[34:10] gonna be on that tree is in that seed
[34:12] that's die because I will that one
[34:16] little seed that you can just barely
[34:18] know me like a pea
[34:19] I've got a tree now this about that big
[34:21] around with five hundred Apple only come
[34:24] out of that one seed all right same way
[34:27] with God so the kiss you
[34:28] come up that's Martin Luther the last
[34:30] was in that but that wasn't all he
[34:33] continued to make a stock less swing a
[34:37] tassel Pentecost and then the truth
[34:40] Steve which is me and you because it's
[34:42] the law reproduction you gotta have a
[34:43] seed to make another plan right for us
[34:47] to be proud like we are now we had to
[34:49] have Martin Luther's today but just a
[34:51] little portion well then yes we can
[35:03] yes my hand though here yeah we camera
[35:06] but he could not but he could not but he
[35:11] could not he could handle the phone if
[35:13] he would have got to fill for it you
[35:16] wouldn't be here that's why I said the
[35:19] reason he didn't come to fullness
[35:21] justice your sin here today thanks man
[35:25] yes predestination deed and it had to be
[35:28] the plan of God because remember to
[35:29] shoot is not the see it contains the
[35:34] life of the seat right but it's kind of
[35:37] a little like what went in the ground to
[35:39] shoots didn't go in the ground the Steve
[35:42] went in the ground to shoots come out of
[35:44] the sea then to stop then the tassel
[35:46] then what the Steve hanging at the end
[35:48] is me and you we saw going to Illinois
[35:54] last week we saw a grain I'm in a field
[35:57] full of wheat you know when we tread
[35:59] into harvest you know how the farmer
[36:00] knows that come get bow his head that
[36:05] whole long thing bounces head like this
[36:07] and we saw that going to
[36:12] [Music]
[36:20] like
[36:21] kind of
[36:26] we're still at
[36:28] [Music]
[36:31] but we can his group could not Leslie
[36:35] could not Pentecost good night and part
[36:38] of the first part of brother rounds
[36:41] message good night but you're the last
[36:44] time you're the second one remember it
[36:47] went away from them I rented the
[36:48] closeness six healed it's gone from use
[36:52] not for you while they were in that open
[36:53] a console age of hair and dress and
[36:57] clothes not the revelation of the full
[37:00] open in the book but it listen it's all
[37:06] for you and me I don't think that's the
[37:08] only way I said it's just because he
[37:11] wanted somebody to be the fullness of
[37:13] the work and to be the fullness of the
[37:16] work and I started a little plant that
[37:18] started to shoot you have to go up just
[37:20] like cuz you know what I can't do
[37:21] anything that he hadn't already done
[37:22] before
[37:23] okay he can't he can't change his plan
[37:27] this plan stays the same we have to
[37:31] adhere to that plan Martin Luther
[37:32] adhered to that plan but what happened
[37:35] now when Martin Luther passed away what
[37:38] happened was the people took his
[37:39] doctrine and said this is it and said no
[37:44] more
[37:45] well see God never says that no more
[37:49] that's when they made a Lutheran Church
[37:52] right then what did God do brother I
[37:56] think God just move right on and picked
[37:57] up a man named John Wesley who got the
[38:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost but he got a
[38:04] little extra he got the part of
[38:07] sanctification to clean you up but
[38:11] remember what in his soul it was in his
[38:14] spirit realm he was born again just like
[38:18] you are but his potential was
[38:22] sanctification liveth
[38:24] sanctified holy life and everything will
[38:27] be okay and you know what this bride
[38:30] waiting now for us to rust to destroy
[38:34] death through the word and bring them
[38:35] back here and they'll be a very joyous
[38:38] people because Luther's people died
[38:42] under the just shall live by faith
[38:45] okay so they were they were given the
[38:49] Holy Ghost bride because of that part of
[38:52] the word I was reading the quote last
[38:55] night while talking where brother Brown
[38:57] said he'd not only preached
[38:59] justification if you read the star TV in
[39:02] church age about the messenger he'll
[39:04] tell you about Martin Luther Martin
[39:06] Luther he said why he preaches just
[39:07] really of my faith now he didn't just
[39:09] turn on the tape recorders and say all
[39:11] right listen to this just shall live by
[39:12] faith the just shall live by faith to
[39:14] just open only preach the Bible but
[39:17] here's an angle was come out of that
[39:21] Catholic Church doing all that you used
[39:24] to do and come into the Bible and read
[39:26] that the just shall live by the faith of
[39:29] God not the faith like you know where
[39:32] they have their faith for 59 years they
[39:34] had it that kind of attorney they had
[39:36] that Catholic dogma they didn't have it
[39:40] in the Word of God because they didn't
[39:41] have the Word of God met with Catholic
[39:43] kept it away from puffing so let's get
[39:47] back this we got to get the Hebrews 10
[39:50] living it's got living for I'd like to
[39:51] get to for a way now we're a mission of
[39:56] these is there's no more offering for
[39:57] sin having therefore brethren boldness
[40:00] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[40:03] Jesus that's the new birth the only a
[40:06] whole is is what it's that middle and if
[40:09] you're warning in that middleman you're
[40:11] saying
[40:11] been remitted and never well standing in
[40:13] and then never send in the first place
[40:15] that's what we got a real life the
[40:17] second realm is where we're having a
[40:19] problem because Satan is going around
[40:20] and around like this right inside that
[40:23] second realm but this message to me the
[40:26] statute perfectman
[40:27] touches on that second realm telling you
[40:32] what you already are Martin Luther
[40:35] probably read those who he's justified
[40:38] he's already glorified and he probably
[40:39] shouted about it but you know what the
[40:40] Holy Ghost in silent helps it that's
[40:42] exactly the trade yeah but he couldn't
[40:45] explain how that happened because even
[40:47] have enough workers planned but like I
[40:50] said he had an arrow listen gentle speck
[40:55] the smallest babe that goes back is done
[40:58] is he turned so whatever Martin lives
[41:01] are having doesn't matter if it looked
[41:03] like a molecule if it was God he's
[41:06] eternal okay so that's what I want to
[41:09] tell you this wasn't want to tell you
[41:10] last night any part of God that's
[41:13] revealed to you and it's a revelation it
[41:15] is eternal can never go away so Martin
[41:20] Luther said to just shall live by faith
[41:22] and God said I'm happy with that part
[41:25] right there let's go to that for a while
[41:27] until the next group comes thank you
[41:29] come even you leavin you baby form
[41:32] justification God can't just dump all
[41:34] the word on you you wouldn't be able to
[41:36] handle it take a baby and a month old
[41:40] start shoving shoving state down
[41:43] straight you kill the baby right you got
[41:47] to feed it that's the same way God big
[41:48] dusty bottle feeds us hand feeds us and
[41:50] then all of a sudden one day says cut
[41:53] your own food
[41:58] oh well the questions are we about why
[42:03] they didn't like that because of that
[42:06] and it come the same way and really it
[42:09] is I mean you you're a baby your spirit
[42:12] born babe in Christ does another a
[42:14] Riblet reveal the seals to you because
[42:15] you you have to process whatever you do
[42:18] in this life I don't care if it's
[42:22] worldly things and I don't mean worldly
[42:24] I mean your job your bills you're in it
[42:28] it's got to go through your brain you
[42:30] have to process that God's not going to
[42:33] just throw it down in here no you got
[42:39] here it first I'm not going to give you
[42:42] a new birth that you've never heard of
[42:43] I've heard the word doctor at all have
[42:45] you gonna birth you come to miss the
[42:46] birth of the word then you must hear and
[42:49] hold on that's what boat salesman
[42:51] telling us for three and a half years
[42:52] they heard God talk himself
[42:55] there was no filter left there was no
[42:58] chance of error when it took him three
[43:01] and a half years to receive the Holy
[43:04] Ghost
[43:04] but once they received the Holy Ghost
[43:06] all that was quicken that they had heard
[43:09] for that dream that had here same way
[43:11] with you and I just I've told you my
[43:13] story I'll tell you again real quick
[43:15] when I got born again I believe I went
[43:18] faster than others or in my process
[43:20] because I have all this laying in here
[43:23] from 14 and 15 years old of reading and
[43:27] studying and all that I don't but you
[43:31] know what he had something work with
[43:33] somebody come in off the street that
[43:35] struggled see I can't not I can't enter
[43:41] into that I could try but it's just like
[43:44] some of you that have parents that are
[43:46] deceased I can't come up you insane
[43:48] though how you feel my parents are alive
[43:50] I can now I never want to go up with
[43:52] somebody above I know anything
[43:54] well both your parents alive of mine
[43:56] dude what Lela right no I don't know how
[43:59] you failed if one of them was to pass
[44:00] away because both of my buddy if one of
[44:02] mine passed away then I could enter in
[44:04] we'll see Christ enter and he said he's
[44:06] no went through all this and he's done
[44:08] entered in that's what we're talking
[44:09] about now he's a high priest in their
[44:11] name one time so he knows the bidding of
[44:13] your infirmity and can help you through
[44:15] these things but I'll promise you one
[44:18] thing you can
