[34:54] because truly you are worthy amen and
[34:58] father we ask you to do as we sing that
[35:01] you would Open the Eyes of our hearts
[35:03] that we may see you Lord the spiritual
[35:06] understanding that would dwell in each
[35:08] one of us we ask you to bless each one
[35:10] now remember the sick among us you said
[35:13] you sent your word and healed us so we
[35:15] believe that you will do that we ask you
[35:18] now to just have your way and bless each
[35:20] one that we may all Lord receive what
[35:23] you would have for us this day L
[35:26] remember those that are not here and

[35:30] their understanding also guide each one
[35:32] now and keep us in Jesus
[35:35] name amen and
[35:37] amen now I'm going to read a couple of
[35:42] verses but what I want you to do is go
[35:45] back and read all back before then and
[35:48] you'll see why in a minute because
[35:50] that's why we're we're doing it but go
[35:52] to Hebrews 8 and one and remember the
[35:56] sixth chapter
[35:58] he winds up talking and getting into who
[36:01] is
[36:02] mzd all right then he goes through the
[36:04] seventh
[36:05] chapter of explaining mzc and who he is
[36:09] and all of the things of the priesthood
[36:12] and and and all like that and then now
[36:15] look what he says in verse one of the
[36:17] eth chapter now of the things which we
[36:21] have
[36:22] spoken you know the things that he's
[36:24] covered now the book of Hebrews up till
[36:26] now watch what he said
[36:28] this is the
[36:30] sum all right now what is the
[36:33] sum the understanding of what is fixing
[36:35] to say now we have such an high priest
[36:39] who is set on the right hand of the
[36:41] Throne of the
[36:43] Majesty in the heavens all right now go
[36:47] back to
[36:49] Ecclesiastes like I said if that's hard
[36:51] to find go to Proverbs it's between
[36:53] Proverbs and the songs of Solomon
[36:58] now then here the
[37:01] Ecclesiastes he covers the
[37:03] entire uh 12 chapters you know and he's
[37:07] coming down to the last two verses and
[37:10] look what he says in the 12th chapter
[37:13] and verse
[37:15] 13 let us hear the
[37:18] conclusion of the whole
[37:20] matter now then what is the conclusion
[37:23] of the whole
[37:25] matter to fear God and and keep his
[37:28] Commandments for this is the whole
[37:31] duty of man you may be seated to the
[37:34] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[37:36] the
[37:37] word
[37:40] now I should have used these
[37:43] scriptures um last Sunday afternoon and
[37:47] U this past
[37:51] Wednesday but uh you know we'll just go
[37:54] from here because what we're going to do
[37:56] for a while is take some topics you
[37:59] remember I told you that we wasn't
[38:01] backing up as much as you would think
[38:05] but that we were speaking from a certain
[38:07] position of thought and understanding
[38:11] that when the prophet said that the head
[38:13] and body would unite in the last days to
[38:18] bring the message all right now you say
[38:21] but brother random brought the message
[38:23] that's true that's right but then the 54
[38:27] Ministry must take that message and
[38:29] break it down to the people all right
[38:31] then the people must take the message
[38:33] and break it down to one another right
[38:35] and then the people must become which is
[38:37] the fivefold ministry and the whole
[38:39] church together we must become what the
[38:43] prophet has
[38:44] said because that way then we would be
[38:48] able to understand so it would have been
[38:51] really good to have given the last
[38:53] couple of messages cuz what we spoke on
[38:55] was true Grace and and uh see but you
[38:59] remember what I said
[39:01] now in the book of Hebrews Paul had
[39:04] bringing down from the situation of all
[39:08] up to that
[39:10] point he makes an outstanding statement
[39:14] he said this is the sum you know sum
[39:17] means like the chief or main
[39:19] point in other words the principal thing
[39:23] that you're talking about or it can mean
[39:26] amount of anything you
[39:29] know it has those meaning but then
[39:32] Ecclesiastes said
[39:35] that this is the
[39:37] conclusion which means the end you know
[39:41] of a
[39:42] matter see so he was closing out
[39:45] Ecclesiastes was closing out what he was
[39:47] having to say and he says now here's the
[39:49] conclusion of the matter here's the end
[39:52] of the matter you know words I I spoke
[39:54] to you all of these things and I want
[39:57] you to know here is the conclusion of
[40:00] the matter to What Fear God and keep his
[40:03] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[40:05] of man uh now so what we're going to do
[40:09] is I don't know how many are what we'll
[40:11] do but we're going to take some topics
[40:14] and things and and that's why I said
[40:16] that I wish I had used it last Sunday
[40:19] there but that's all right we'll still
[40:21] just go on but see when we were talking
[40:24] about true Grace
[40:28] now to bring something to a
[40:32] conclusion it means you summed up all of
[40:35] the things you know and then you're
[40:38] making a
[40:40] statement from that that would show what
[40:44] you're talking
[40:45] about right so Paul in all of his doings
[40:49] of explaining up through Hebrews uh 7
[40:53] through it the of the one true and the
[40:56] Living God and how that mzd was that God
[41:00] and uh you
[41:02] know and in Jesus we see no more of mzc
[41:05] because he became Jesus
[41:07] Christ because the one true and living
[41:10] God all right so he's summing all that
[41:12] up all right and then Ecclesiastes says
[41:16] we're going to come to the end of
[41:18] it now uh brother Mo many many years ago
[41:21] brought out a word that um from the
[41:26] Greek and I'm sure Greek or Hebrew one
[41:28] but it means morine now not like the
[41:32] shot morphine that you take for
[41:35] sicknesses it means morine in the fact
[41:38] that and if I mispronounce it so you
[41:40] know you corrected whatever uh it means
[41:43] that when you come to the end of the
[41:45] conclusion of something you summed it up
[41:49] and you make a
[41:50] statement then it means nothing else can
[41:52] be added to that statement amen all
[41:55] right so now I I believe that it's time
[41:58] that you and I by the opening of the
[42:00] word in the end time can make
[42:04] statements and bring things to a
[42:08] conclusion and say this is what it is
[42:11] right you know all right and then uh we
[42:15] don't have to worry now there was a time
[42:18] we all was concerned about because we
[42:20] looked at the Bible where it would say
[42:23] uh be therefore perfect even as your
[42:25] father in Heaven is perfect will get to
[42:27] that you know eventually and and you
[42:30] know we would think well boy we're we're
[42:32] perfect but then somebody would come
[42:34] along and they would preach none good no
[42:36] not one well then we wored in between
[42:39] the two and we were actually what we
[42:42] were doing was making it
[42:45] contrary one to the other you know right
[42:49] all right cuz it would look like an
[42:51] opposite View and we would make it
[42:53] contrary when it was the same Bible
[42:55] saying both things
[42:58] all right so then uh you know if it's
[43:01] the same
[43:03] Bible see like it is in water baptism
[43:07] that we read there in you know Matthew
[43:10] 28:19 it tells us to be baptized what in
[43:14] the name of the father and of the son
[43:16] and of the Holy Ghost right but 10 days
[43:20] later from the statement D the Holy
[43:23] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and
[43:25] they asked Peter said you know what ask
[43:29] Apostles and Peter answered said you
[43:31] know men and Brethren what must we do to
[43:33] be
[43:35] saved they said repent every one of them
[43:37] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[43:39] Christ
[43:41] right
[43:43] well well Peter couldn't remember too
[43:46] good you know right 10 days prior to
[43:49] that the Lord Jesus looked like he was
[43:51] saying Father Son and Holy Ghost right
[43:54] but see Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[43:56] a name right
[43:57] father's not a name son's not a name
[43:59] Holy Ghost is not a name all right now
[44:01] see so then we sum it all
[44:04] up and realize that is like I said there
[44:07] Wednesday night though I think it was
[44:09] that I have heard people say in this
[44:12] message to say we take acts 238 for our
[44:18] baptism the denominations Etc takes uh
[44:21] you know Matthew 28:19 no if they took
[44:25] Matthew 28:19 they would have to get
[44:27] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:30] Christ because see you couldn't make one
[44:33] contrary to the other one right oh but
[44:36] Brother D there's contradictions in the
[44:37] Bible I'm with Brother brandom come and
[44:39] show me where they're at right
[44:42] amen come and show me where the
[44:44] contradictions are oh yeah our human
[44:47] mind now right we have a lot of
[44:51] contradictions right but now come and
[44:54] show me where one is contrary to the
[44:56] other one see and that's what I'm trying
[44:58] to tell you or to show you that that
[45:00] there's a lot of things that now we
[45:04] understand that we previously did not
[45:07] have the understanding right and so we
[45:10] could you know it would be a a an
[45:13] argument and you'd say well uh you know
[45:15] like some used to say well uh I'll shoot
[45:18] down your scripture with what with a
[45:20] scripture well now that's like taking
[45:22] what you want and arguing over it right
[45:26] now but that won't that won't never work
[45:30] cuz you'll never get any kind of an
[45:31] answer there you can't come to a
[45:33] conclusion as Ecclesiastes said you
[45:37] can't sum up what you're saying amen you
[45:40] know so then if you got all kind of
[45:43] contradictions then what is the the uh
[45:46] answer if I ask you the reason of the
[45:48] hope that lies within you as the
[45:50] scripture said what would be your
[45:53] answer well I don't really
[45:55] know and that's the way they are a lot
[45:57] of them in the message cuz once you
[45:59] narrow down things especially about
[46:01] Daniel 70 weeks or something like that
[46:03] they'll say well I don't really
[46:06] know right well the prophet preached
[46:10] said why can't we know
[46:13] amen I mean you know now what he didn't
[46:16] preach we don't have to worry
[46:20] abouten cuz that's up to him but now as
[46:23] I said Paul said let's sum this up
[46:28] so that'll be your
[46:30] title it'll probably be for a few weeks
[46:32] you know maybe few
[46:34] Services Way's going to preach this
[46:36] afternoon for us we didn't know he was
[46:39] going to have to work today but he wound
[46:40] up having to work half the day and
[46:42] Terren took over his Sunday school class
[46:44] and he must have really let y'all have
[46:45] it for 10 minutes because I looked at my
[46:47] watch and here it come up I thought my
[46:50] Lord I want to get that tape let's just
[46:52] go get it and play it now I want
[46:54] everybody to he didn't realize he's
[46:56] being taped
[46:57] he's on internet around the world so he
[47:00] made his what do you call it debut or
[47:03] his beginning of teaching Sunday school
[47:06] this morning and we appreciate that all
[47:09] right appreciate everybody and what they
[47:10] do around here and everything you do you
[47:12] know all right now so do you understand
[47:15] what I'm talking
[47:17] about I
[47:19] think that by the prophet's
[47:22] message you know being preached unto us
[47:25] and him bringing the scripture and
[47:27] covering the things I I think that we we
[47:30] can come down to a conclusion we were
[47:33] discussing with a man one time something
[47:35] and he said well that's all right said
[47:38] about having these ministers meetings
[47:40] and things you know he said that's all
[47:41] right but said brother brand a here to
[47:43] straighten it out you know I said well
[47:48] what he says is
[47:49] here you know because that's that's what
[47:52] I believe now folks anything you name to
[47:56] me
[47:57] you name me any topic that brother
[48:00] brandham said and I'll show you a
[48:04] quote you know that will sound like
[48:08] right that is totally contrary
[48:11] right
[48:14] now you know like one true and living
[48:18] God he said he never Tau nothing but
[48:21] that but I show you where he said let's
[48:23] stand and address the third person of
[48:25] the trinity
[48:28] well now was he wrong or was he trying
[48:30] to uh uh
[48:34] appease those that he was around no he's
[48:38] telling the
[48:40] truth he said I believe in a
[48:43] trinity but he said it's not Trinity of
[48:46] persons right it's Trinity of
[48:50] manifestation
[48:52] right so then you know it's not wrong to
[48:56] but anything you name to me I can
[48:57] probably out of memory from my mind can
[49:00] bring you a quote that would be contrary
[49:04] almost to that you now but I believe the
[49:09] message comes together Amen to sum up
[49:13] what God is revealing to you and I I
[49:17] believe this message is the sum of those
[49:19] things of the Bible right you know as
[49:23] Paul was saying in the eighth chapter
[49:25] the sum of all I said for for seven
[49:27] chapters now this is the sum of it you
[49:30] know of what and he said he made a
[49:33] statement from that and he
[49:36] said this is the PSM we have such an
[49:39] high priest who is set on the right hand
[49:42] of the Throne of the Majesty in the
[49:45] heaven you know we can sum it up by
[49:48] saying we believe in one true and living
[49:52] God now that's what we're going to be
[49:55] doing you know a few Services all
[49:58] right but now in
[50:02] Acts 17 I think it is in
[50:05] 11 the Bible says that the
[50:08] disciples searched the Scriptures
[50:13] Daily all right now what did they have
[50:15] to
[50:16] search the
[50:19] Scrolls they didn't have Matthew Mark
[50:22] Luke and John written down cuz it was
[50:25] only about somewhere around ad50 when
[50:27] they were actually started to wri
[50:31] it but they were searching the Old
[50:33] Testament Scrolls the scriptures right
[50:36] to see if what was being said was right
[50:42] right now then Paul as Peter would
[50:46] say that he says things hard to be
[50:49] understood to they that are not learned
[50:52] wrestle to their own destruction right
[50:56] all right see Paul winds up to be the
[51:01] spokesman for the New
[51:04] Testament all right not that Peter and
[51:06] him was was you know any problem I'll
[51:08] get to that in a minute but it was the
[51:11] fact that Paul had the greater
[51:14] understanding brother said that Paul
[51:16] understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of
[51:18] the new amen and the others didn't
[51:21] necessarily understand at that fullness
[51:23] what did they understand
[51:27] you mean did they understand the Trinity
[51:29] and Paul understood one God no no they
[51:32] understood that Jehovah the old was
[51:34] Jesus of the new but they didn't
[51:36] understand that Jehovah the old Jesus
[51:38] was new like Paul
[51:39] did right right now we get to that in a
[51:42] minute partial and perfect realization
[51:44] okay cuz I'm making a background out of
[51:46] this this
[51:48] message but see they searched in
[51:51] scriptures and then they begin to see in
[51:55] the book of Acts
[51:58] that God had used Paul
[52:01] to you know as the main
[52:04] spokesman the greater
[52:07] Revelation and they credited that and
[52:09] honored it until you'll find them in the
[52:13] the uh Ephesian age you know as really
[52:16] rebuking and saying you're not saying
[52:18] what Paul
[52:21] said they come to the conclusion of the
[52:24] matter that Paul had the word of of the
[52:27] Lord all right now but remember Paul
[52:31] didn't have his own
[52:33] ideas but Paul is so specific in his
[52:38] writings that he says you will be judged
[52:42] by my
[52:47] gospel so now for the day and the hour
[52:50] that Paul was living he had the Bible
[52:53] Understanding to the perfect realization
[52:56] right
[52:57] right and to he to the point that he
[52:59] would even
[53:01] say that if you say anything contrary to
[53:04] what I'm going to say he said let you be
[53:06] a cursed that's right that's
[53:10] right all right let him be a liar let
[53:13] him be a
[53:14] whatever he's pretty strong wouldn't he
[53:17] right he got that Authority from
[53:22] God cuz Paul brought the New Testament
[53:25] in the the we understand now Faith of
[53:28] the fathers the
[53:29] things he brought it to a conclusion
[53:33] right he summed it all up he goes to the
[53:37] back side of the desert he stays out
[53:39] there for so many
[53:42] years he comes
[53:45] back and he sums up all of the things of
[53:48] the Old Testament amen all right now
[53:52] when he came back he didn't say Peter
[53:54] you're wrong right John you're
[53:57] wrong Mark whoever you know he point him
[54:00] out Luke you know he say you're
[54:05] wrong he said you
[54:09] understand but he said God has given me
[54:11] this
[54:12] understanding now if those two
[54:15] understandings was contrary one to the
[54:17] other then which one are you going to
[54:21] follow if in this message you think I
[54:25] have this quote quotes these
[54:27] quot right and somebody else comes along
[54:30] with something
[54:31] else then which one are you going to
[54:35] follow see now I'm going to believe as I
[54:38] laid it down that Peter expressing the
[54:43] fact that Paul had a greater
[54:47] Revelation but Peter was the one that
[54:50] said you know was up on the
[54:54] mountain I was up there and Paul wasn't
[54:56] up on the mountain I was up on the
[54:59] mountain but he said I have a more sure
[55:01] word of
[55:03] Prophecy I was up there and saw it but
[55:06] the new birth right brought Peter a
[55:09] greater understanding now we'll get to
[55:11] that in a minute cuz I got some quotes
[55:13] and I'm I'm holding them because I want
[55:14] to read them for the point I want to
[55:16] want you to do but I'll sure give you
[55:18] the page number paragraph whatever but
[55:21] see they search the scriptures now daily
[55:24] to see what are the things
[55:27] that had been said was right or not well
[55:30] why can't we search the
[55:32] Bible and the prophet's message because
[55:35] now we have an ability to search the
[55:38] scriptures
[55:40] amen we're not back in the Dark Ages and
[55:43] the things like that we're not back
[55:45] where man couldn't understand we're down
[55:48] here with in the end time of the baptism
[55:50] of the Holy Ghost coming to the faith of
[55:53] the
[55:54] fathers and speaking of adoption and The
[55:56] Headstone as I was bringing the other
[55:58] day where the head and body would unite
[56:00] and bring its own
[56:02] message well I made that as simple as I
[56:05] could then what's he going to say when
[56:08] he when The Headstone comes what is The
[56:09] Headstone message for
[56:11] the end time I'm
[56:15] here I'm here but see you can read
[56:18] quotes and you can do you know brother
[56:20] call H me that one on the front that you
[56:22] remember what I done Wednesday night
[56:23] some of you wouldn't
[56:25] hear yeah
[56:26] that and and we gave out some little
[56:29] little tracks with a bunch of letters on
[56:33] it h if you want one of these be glad to
[56:36] give it to you but see you look at it
[56:38] and figure out what's being
[56:40] said all so you look at it you look you
[56:44] say well what is being said there it is
[56:47] g o d i s n o w h e r e now some people
[56:52] called it immediately I walked into my
[56:54] wife I said what does that say she said
[56:56] it says God is here is now
[57:00] here that's exactly right but you can
[57:04] also look at it and divide it up and say
[57:06] that God is nowhere
[57:09] right amen with the same letters right I
[57:12] can say God is nowhere
[57:15] right but with an understanding that
[57:17] says God is here well now that's
[57:20] according to whether you understand or
[57:25] not so let's search the message now cuz
[57:29] that's the only way that that I know
[57:31] anything about that you know about what
[57:33] the Bible says is I I search the
[57:36] message if I want to know about what
[57:38] something says well I just read that I
[57:41] go see what the prophet has to say about
[57:43] it am before I speak on it I ask the
[57:46] prophet what is this that you're talking
[57:48] about what does this scripture mean you
[57:51] and things all right there's a lot of
[57:53] scriptures in the Bible that I've
[57:55] refused to ever speak of because I
[57:56] couldn't find what the prophet said
[57:59] about all right so that's just the way I
[58:02] do it of course everybody don't do it
[58:04] that way but that's all
[58:07] right now the way I want to approach
[58:10] this is to
[58:13] compare scriptures and quotes and
[58:18] things not compare it with to the basis
[58:22] or search it to fi try to find which one
[58:26] is
[58:28] correct you
[58:30] know but I want to look at it that it
[58:33] makes a beautiful picture right and
[58:36] unless it was said the way it was
[58:41] said that you would not be able to
[58:44] understand it when it would come down to
[58:47] the basis of saying it you know and we
[58:51] say well we know this is right and like
[58:53] I said now we can reading the Bible
[58:56] where Jesus said baptized in the name of
[58:59] the father and of the son and of the
[59:00] Holy Ghost and people will say I'm going
[59:03] to say what Jesus said well just
[59:06] remember amen the man that wrote that
[59:09] wasn't
[59:10] Jesus right the man that wrote that down
[59:13] for us was
[59:18] Matthew now so you saying well now I'll
[59:22] take what this or I'll take what Peter
[59:24] says or I'll take what Paul says or I I
[59:26] want to take it all to bring a beautiful
[59:29] picture right cuz that's what I believe
[59:31] the Bible does I believe his prophet's
[59:33] message brought a beautiful picture or I
[59:35] wouldn't be here today talking about
[59:40] it
[59:42] now I know now so don't misunderstand
[59:46] me I know that even brother randam
[59:49] taught like the white horse rider was
[59:52] the Holy
[59:54] Ghost there was some things he
[59:56] Tau throughout the
[59:58] message that would have not been
[1:00:02] correct now that doesn't fit now so
[1:00:05] white horse rider being
[1:00:07] the the prophet preaching it as the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost and then preaching later as the
[1:00:13] Antichrist that's not partial and
[1:00:15] perfect realization don't try to bring
[1:00:17] that together cuz that won't fit
[1:00:20] together all right but you see he
[1:00:23] corrected it that's right now what he
[1:00:26] didn't correct you better leave it alone
[1:00:29] right right now that's just blunt as I
[1:00:31] can be all right see Brother Don ruddle
[1:00:35] used to make a statement years ago and
[1:00:36] remember it was pretty good he said
[1:00:38] anybody with oneeyed and high sense or
[1:00:40] know that's
[1:00:41] right if it's just plain Common Sense we
[1:00:44] to know if God sent a prophet then God
[1:00:46] was to honor that prophet's word but see
[1:00:49] now you understand what I'm
[1:00:50] saying but if he corrected
[1:00:54] it see if he said I used to think it was
[1:00:57] this way we'll get back to this one of
[1:00:59] these days and and I'll go ahead now but
[1:01:00] show you kind of how I'm going and and
[1:01:03] what is the evidence of the Holy
[1:01:05] Ghost he will take a topic on that amen
[1:01:09] you know what is the evidence of the
[1:01:10] Holy Ghost I just believe the word well
[1:01:13] now are you going to leave out where it
[1:01:14] says by their fruits you shall be
[1:01:17] know no you better not leave that out
[1:01:20] because your Prophet still used
[1:01:23] it so you understand what I'm trying to
[1:01:25] get that yes I don't think that we were
[1:01:28] sent to correct brother brandham or
[1:01:30] anyone else because if you can correct
[1:01:32] brother brandham I've always been that
[1:01:34] away anybody can correct brother
[1:01:35] brandham the prophet of God that was
[1:01:36] brought to us the message he brought if
[1:01:38] they can correct we ought to be
[1:01:39] following that person and not brother
[1:01:41] brandham that's plain
[1:01:43] s well brother so and so says he he was
[1:01:46] wrong here well then let brother so and
[1:01:48] so come here and tell me where he's
[1:01:50] wrong
[1:01:52] yeah but just remember he better bring
[1:01:54] all of his quotes with
[1:01:57] him I'm not arrogant and hateful I'm
[1:02:00] just plain
[1:02:01] blunt you know big old man sitting on
[1:02:04] one porch one time and he was talking
[1:02:06] about how that brother randam was
[1:02:07] Malachi 3 you know and we had Malachi 4
[1:02:10] had to come and and uh so after a while
[1:02:13] I picked up what he's talking about I
[1:02:15] just looked him in the face and he
[1:02:16] weighed about 475 lb big old guy and uh
[1:02:20] I looked him in the face I said well let
[1:02:22] me tell you
[1:02:23] something John the Baptist was Miki we
[1:02:26] can prove that by the scriptures brother
[1:02:28] R's message would fall into Malachi 4
[1:02:30] you know the understanding and opening
[1:02:32] of the word and I said but now I'm going
[1:02:34] to tell you to your face if you think
[1:02:35] you're Malachi 4 which HS what he did
[1:02:38] see I said If You Think You're Malachi 4
[1:02:41] I want to tell you face you're not
[1:02:44] him cuz I'm a been sarcastic God he and
[1:02:47] I real friends today may be listening to
[1:02:49] this tap he has done it I know but I'm
[1:02:53] not arguing I'm not mad nobody
[1:02:57] I just tell it the way I see
[1:02:59] it I'm not the final Authority around
[1:03:01] here God is all right now to help us to
[1:03:05] understand to get a better understanding
[1:03:07] of things I believe brother brandom grew
[1:03:10] in Grace and
[1:03:11] knowledge I believe the Bible said Jesus
[1:03:13] grew in Grace enough all right now see
[1:03:18] all right now to grow in Grace and
[1:03:20] knowledge does not mean to correct
[1:03:24] things right unless it needs to be
[1:03:28] corrected to grow in Grace and knowledge
[1:03:31] so you can't say that you used to
[1:03:33] believe in a trinity now listen to what
[1:03:36] I'm saying now be I'm specific when I
[1:03:38] talk so listen you say I used to believe
[1:03:41] in a trinity but I grow in Grace and
[1:03:42] knowledge now what do you
[1:03:45] mean you didn't grow in Grace and
[1:03:47] knowledge you ought to repented to
[1:03:49] believe in a
[1:03:51] trinity you can't take a trinity and
[1:03:54] grow in Grace and knowled and it come
[1:03:56] out to be one
[1:03:59] God come on well of course we say but
[1:04:02] I've grow in Grace and knowledge now
[1:04:04] when you grow in Grace and knowledge is
[1:04:06] when you get an understanding a partial
[1:04:09] realization of one true and living
[1:04:13] God not a trinity but a partial
[1:04:17] realization of one true and living God
[1:04:19] and then you can grow in Grace and
[1:04:22] knowledge but you understand that's way
[1:04:24] people talk and that's all right maybe
[1:04:26] they mean what I'm saying but I don't I
[1:04:28] just listen I'm sorry cuz if you say I
[1:04:31] used to believe in in hell was eternal
[1:04:34] but now I don't believe in hell is
[1:04:36] eternal I've grow in Grace and knowledge
[1:04:39] well now what you're saying is okay but
[1:04:41] are you saying that the eternal hell was
[1:04:46] right no you can't do that that's right
[1:04:49] you can't grow in Grace and knowledge of
[1:04:53] error come on Amen it just won't fit
[1:04:57] that's right see I believe things will
[1:04:59] open into a deeper deeper
[1:05:02] meaning huh amen you know I believe God
[1:05:06] does not reveal to you and I I don't
[1:05:08] believe he revealed it to brother
[1:05:11] brandom there was a man that said he
[1:05:13] never believed it but one true and
[1:05:15] living
[1:05:16] God right cuz he was a
[1:05:20] prophet okay but you know what he said
[1:05:22] one
[1:05:23] day he said I used to to Think Jesus
[1:05:26] loved me and the father hated me he said
[1:05:30] I found out there a selfs same person
[1:05:32] right you know what he done he grow in
[1:05:34] Grace and
[1:05:36] knowledge right then when he come to the
[1:05:41] seals and he went back and he repr
[1:05:43] preached a lot of messages that he had
[1:05:46] preached prior to
[1:05:48] then but he preached it in a deeper
[1:05:50] meaning amen right all right now listen
[1:05:54] to these quotes
[1:05:57] we're all familiar with where the
[1:05:58] Prophet would
[1:05:59] say the Bible became a brand new book
[1:06:05] amen but are you familiar with this
[1:06:09] statement remember that was after the
[1:06:11] opening of the seals when he made that
[1:06:14] statement that was on God's power to
[1:06:16] transform 1965
[1:06:19] 911 how about this statement glorified
[1:06:23] Jesus 1955
[1:06:30] 2:25 now the only way that boy could
[1:06:33] have ever did that and know that that
[1:06:35] was the right sacrifice it had to be a
[1:06:37] spiritual Revelation from God that's
[1:06:39] exactly now this is
[1:06:41] 1955 it's been ever since spiritual
[1:06:44] revealed
[1:06:46] truth how God in his Mercy through the
[1:06:50] operation of the Holy Spirit reveals
[1:06:52] spiritual truth the word itself and if
[1:06:55] you're trying to read it from some
[1:06:57] educational
[1:06:58] standpoint
[1:07:00] listen and you just read it like you was
[1:07:02] trying to in other words figure out
[1:07:04] mathematically
[1:07:06] something but if you read it after you
[1:07:09] have received Christ into your
[1:07:12] heart now did you hear what he said
[1:07:15] you're just reading it intellectually or
[1:07:17] whatever you want to know like reading a
[1:07:18] newspaper you know read
[1:07:20] anything but if you read it after you
[1:07:23] have received Christ into your heart
[1:07:25] it's a brand new book
[1:07:30] again you remember that you remember
[1:07:33] when you got converted now the Bible
[1:07:36] became beautiful
[1:07:38] wonderful the things you had read
[1:07:41] before seem to just Amplified and
[1:07:46] magnified you know it just
[1:07:51] wonderful so you don't have to wait
[1:07:53] until the seals
[1:07:54] break for it to be a new book so we
[1:07:57] start off with a new book as partial
[1:07:59] realization when you're born
[1:08:02] again we read it by the holy spirit amen
[1:08:06] right now watch this one contending for
[1:08:09] the faith 1956
[1:08:14] 020 with all of our
[1:08:16] theology if you ever go to Jerusalem or
[1:08:18] the Eastern country where this Bible was
[1:08:20] written it's a brand new book to you
[1:08:26] been there experienced that right our
[1:08:29] Western ideas are far from the Eastern
[1:08:32] ways you'll not can't understand The
[1:08:35] Parables and so forth the teaching until
[1:08:38] you go there and see those same Customs
[1:08:41] lived out today well now brother
[1:08:44] brandham never went to Jerusalem but he
[1:08:47] got close enough to understand all about
[1:08:49] them animals and the things that he saw
[1:08:51] and right cuz he went to Egypt
[1:08:56] but you see he said by seeing something
[1:08:59] or experiencing it you know and
[1:09:01] understanding it the Bible becomes a new
[1:09:04] book I've got it written from you know
[1:09:06] some here have been there and I've got
[1:09:07] it written in my Bible like we visited
[1:09:10] here we visited here we visited here we
[1:09:12] visited here well that's wonderful to me
[1:09:15] cuz it made it look good you know like
[1:09:17] in the Bible it talks about a a uh u
[1:09:20] thig
[1:09:21] tree well we don't have fiig trees we
[1:09:23] have fi bushes
[1:09:26] you know what they have over there thick
[1:09:27] trees one we saw was probably about you
[1:09:31] know big as a 5 gallon bucket in
[1:09:34] diameter and probably 30 40 ft high but
[1:09:38] a fiig tree see it made it
[1:09:41] different but you understand what I'm
[1:09:43] saying see the prophet says when you get
[1:09:45] born again it becomes a brand new book
[1:09:47] he said if you can go there and see the
[1:09:50] things now we got the opportunity to be
[1:09:52] able to see it by internet systems or
[1:09:54] video and things that that you you don't
[1:09:57] have to go there you can you can they
[1:09:59] give you a good uh sh and as a matter of
[1:10:01] fact a lot of those are better than
[1:10:03] actually being there because you're not
[1:10:05] able to see all the things that they
[1:10:06] tell you you know because you're in a
[1:10:08] crowd pushing backwards and forward and
[1:10:10] trying to get up here's another group
[1:10:11] over here another group over there and
[1:10:12] you you know we was down there was it
[1:10:15] the P of P of beesa and really the the
[1:10:19] guide with us had to pull us off to
[1:10:21] another place because this guy he was
[1:10:24] over there uh explaining around I think
[1:10:28] it was right pul of Bethesda but anyhow
[1:10:30] and he was very very uh loud so every
[1:10:34] time Ruben start to say something they
[1:10:36] got over the top you know and I'm not
[1:10:38] making fun of him but he just pulled us
[1:10:40] off to the S well we didn't really get
[1:10:42] to see a lot about that so you can go
[1:10:45] get your video and see it your see your
[1:10:47] prophet's not saying you can't
[1:10:49] understand it if you ain't been there it
[1:10:52] can be revealed if you've never been
[1:10:53] there or seen a video either
[1:10:56] right now but you understand see we're
[1:11:00] not putting it on the basis of just
[1:11:02] waiting till the seals
[1:11:05] break we're talking about it as a brand
[1:11:08] new book by the new birth and by even
[1:11:11] being there now we get to the one that's
[1:11:13] on God's power to transform 1965 911 but
[1:11:17] since the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:11:20] of them Angels just behind the mountain
[1:11:22] under this has become a new book it's
[1:11:26] the things that's been hid is being
[1:11:29] revealed as God promised it in
[1:11:31] Revelations
[1:11:33] 10 that he would do it all right now we
[1:11:38] can say the Bible's become a brand new
[1:11:41] book well you know I've heard people
[1:11:43] read out of the old
[1:11:45] book now I'll Express that in a minute
[1:11:47] and say it's a new
[1:11:50] book
[1:11:51] right well I have to admit what they
[1:11:54] read out of it and what they pre preach
[1:11:55] with some other book beside the Bible so
[1:11:58] if they're talking about that kind of a
[1:11:59] new book they got plenty of them cuz you
[1:12:01] can't read a trinity you can't read
[1:12:03] those things you can't read the the two
[1:12:05] Souls the River Jordan the the peruas
[1:12:07] ETC you can't read them out of the
[1:12:10] Bible cuz they're not in it no more than
[1:12:13] it's in the Bible that hell's Eternal no
[1:12:15] because you have to have eternal life to
[1:12:16] live there then God would have to give
[1:12:18] you his own life to send you to hell
[1:12:20] that won't work see there's a lot to be
[1:12:23] understood about hell is can be forever
[1:12:25] forever forever forever forever forever
[1:12:28] forever eternity is not that eternity is
[1:12:31] on
[1:12:33] py but it's you know but do you
[1:12:36] understand what I'm
[1:12:37] saying now this is a background to
[1:12:40] understand some of the things that uh
[1:12:43] you know I want to bring
[1:12:46] out but
[1:12:47] now let me make the point of what I want
[1:12:50] to
[1:12:52] bring see I believe that the Bible
[1:12:56] is
[1:12:57] written the way God wants to write
[1:13:01] it you know and I believe the prophet of
[1:13:04] God preached it as God revealed it to
[1:13:08] him amen I believe we're supposed to do
[1:13:12] that and we're not supposed to mess up
[1:13:15] the Bible but we're supposed to
[1:13:19] understand the things like I've always
[1:13:22] said about when I finish the series you
[1:13:24] on the second coming there and and I've
[1:13:26] always told you in the Bible like his
[1:13:27] three comings of Jesus Christ he comes
[1:13:29] to get his bride he comes to the 144,000
[1:13:32] and the tribulation then he comes back
[1:13:35] with the bride in the Millennium each
[1:13:36] one is his coming but you take either
[1:13:38] one of them in the scriptures for this
[1:13:40] one put it over on this one or this one
[1:13:43] over on this one see you're not you're
[1:13:46] not summing up what's being
[1:13:49] said you're not coming to a conclusion
[1:13:53] you're coming to a messed up
[1:13:58] understanding so then we've got to have
[1:14:00] it to that
[1:14:01] basis but the way I like to to say it is
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:06] know I believe that let me illustrate
[1:14:09] with the Book of
[1:14:11] Daniel in the Book of Daniel if you go
[1:14:13] read it you'll find it that it looks
[1:14:16] like that it is uh multiple Visions
[1:14:20] dreams
[1:14:21] Etc you know and this will be this and
[1:14:25] this will show this and then this will
[1:14:26] show this and this will show this but if
[1:14:28] you read it and really understand the
[1:14:31] understanding of what Daniel is doing
[1:14:33] he's showing you in the Book of Daniel
[1:14:36] uh this and this and this amen and this
[1:14:41] it is all one thing right it's the
[1:14:44] unfolding amen of the word of God right
[1:14:48] he's not shown 10 different things he's
[1:14:51] show he's being shown one thing but each
[1:14:54] one is rising higher am and higher and
[1:14:57] higher illustrate it again like see uh
[1:15:00] we know that it was promised that the
[1:15:02] Messiah would come right right right see
[1:15:07] that was back in Genesis you know I put
[1:15:09] enemity between thy seed and Seed of the
[1:15:11] woman the promise of Jesus Christ coming
[1:15:13] all right but see it was not told how it
[1:15:15] was going to be but then you get over to
[1:15:18] Isaiah which is a complete book in
[1:15:19] itself but you get over in the book of
[1:15:22] Isaiah and you'll find that Isaiah talks
[1:15:24] about a verse shall conceive right well
[1:15:27] what is that more understanding right
[1:15:30] right it's going from partial
[1:15:33] realization toward perfect realization
[1:15:37] right one day th stood a virgin you
[1:15:40] know be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:15:43] she had come to perfect
[1:15:45] realization of what had all had been
[1:15:47] said of the
[1:15:49] Messiah now it's perfect realization
[1:15:52] into her and she conceived
[1:15:55] see I believe that's the way the entire
[1:15:56] Bible is
[1:15:57] written I believe that's the way this
[1:15:59] message is written amen that's why it is
[1:16:02] to the basis that the sinner cannot
[1:16:04] understand it come
[1:16:07] on I don't care how much you read it and
[1:16:09] can memorize it word for
[1:16:12] word there was a man from some
[1:16:15] University came to Gainesville years ago
[1:16:17] to talk to brother George brother Mike
[1:16:20] and brother Tatum and
[1:16:22] him brother Mo and him about
[1:16:25] that they were believing in one God and
[1:16:27] he was trinitarian well now he could
[1:16:29] quote the entire Bible from
[1:16:34] memory me entire Bible he could
[1:16:37] quote but once they got to talking to
[1:16:39] him and they finally got asking him what
[1:16:42] was his name and he saw that he was
[1:16:44] pinned in the wall and he wouldn't even
[1:16:46] say the name Jesus they'd say brother
[1:16:48] George his life and he know he'd say you
[1:16:51] know what's his
[1:16:52] name Rose Shar little that he wouldn't
[1:16:57] say Jesus why because he seen his
[1:17:01] defeated but yet he could memorize
[1:17:04] it to memorize the Bible of this message
[1:17:07] is not the
[1:17:08] point it's for it to be revealed right
[1:17:13] yes if you understand one thing it's
[1:17:17] better than all of our intellect right
[1:17:19] but now I've always said if I don't get
[1:17:21] the intellect first how am I going to
[1:17:22] get a revelation right see because
[1:17:25] people would take that and say I don't
[1:17:27] need to study cuz I might get an
[1:17:29] intellect out of well you ain't going to
[1:17:30] get nothing that's right CU you don't
[1:17:32] have nothing to start
[1:17:34] with right I just
[1:17:37] believe I just believe well why you
[1:17:39] believe well I really don't know but I
[1:17:41] just believe believe
[1:17:43] what the Bible said unless we believe
[1:17:46] that he
[1:17:50] is all right but you understand that
[1:17:54] we're for with a subject of partial to
[1:17:56] perfect
[1:17:58] realization how that brother brandham
[1:18:02] explains it in the church age book 297
[1:18:04] of the Philadelphian Church which is a
[1:18:06] church age
[1:18:08] book these things sayth he that is
[1:18:13] true sound like maybe something false
[1:18:16] you know too no watch you now this word
[1:18:19] true is a very wonderful word it does
[1:18:21] not mean true in just the sense that it
[1:18:24] is is opposite to
[1:18:26] false right that's what we think true
[1:18:29] and false true and false true and
[1:18:34] false it expresses the perfect
[1:18:37] realization of an idea as contrasted
[1:18:40] with its partial realization he goes on
[1:18:43] to
[1:18:44] explain you know that Moses gave him
[1:18:47] Mana in the
[1:18:49] wilderness and Jesus said what I am that
[1:18:53] bread that came down the
[1:18:56] Wilderness the Mana was great and
[1:19:01] wonderful but yet there was a day the
[1:19:03] man ofas when he went into the old and
[1:19:05] ate the old corner of the land it became
[1:19:08] a greater Revelation but see Jesus was
[1:19:11] that
[1:19:12] bread that come down from
[1:19:15] heaven partial realization perfect
[1:19:17] realization okay still on the same page
[1:19:21] 292 since the word indeed expresses
[1:19:24] perfect real ization as against the idea
[1:19:26] of a partial realization as Illustrated
[1:19:28] in these verses we can Now understand as
[1:19:31] never before an to type contrasted with
[1:19:35] type and substance with
[1:19:38] Shadow you know you you take a shadow
[1:19:41] it's not the substance but it's it's the
[1:19:43] shadow of the
[1:19:45] substance there is something there
[1:19:47] that's real or it won't make a
[1:19:50] Shad take the example now of Mana from
[1:19:53] heaven God sent down Angels bread from
[1:19:56] heaven for Israel but that bread does
[1:19:58] not satisfy it was only good for a day
[1:20:01] those who ate it were hungry again the
[1:20:03] next day if it was left around it became
[1:20:06] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:20:09] from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type
[1:20:12] and if any man eats of that bread that
[1:20:15] came from Heaven he will never hunger
[1:20:17] again you remember that's what he said
[1:20:18] to the the little woman at the well you
[1:20:20] know about the water so if you drink of
[1:20:22] this water you'll never thirst oh man
[1:20:26] give it to
[1:20:27] me I you mean I'll never have never be
[1:20:30] thirsty
[1:20:32] again I wouldn't want he
[1:20:35] say he's talking about a spiritual Mana
[1:20:38] spiritual water
[1:20:40] right but see he was trying to lay down
[1:20:43] something and so am I so do you
[1:20:46] understand yes of what I believe whether
[1:20:48] you believe it or not that I can't
[1:20:50] convince you and I can't reveal it so I
[1:20:52] just preach what I believe
[1:20:55] and uh you know I don't try to preach
[1:20:57] what somebody else believes because I
[1:20:59] don't know what somebody else believes
[1:21:02] right I'm honest because you can tell me
[1:21:04] you believe so and so and so and so and
[1:21:05] so and so I said well amen I believe
[1:21:07] that
[1:21:08] much but I don't know what you believe
[1:21:11] but see I believe the Bible as I've laid
[1:21:13] down the situation gives you a partial
[1:21:16] realization of
[1:21:18] something and then it'll turn out to be
[1:21:21] more re revelation of that more
[1:21:24] revelation of that cuz it's Revelation
[1:21:26] added to
[1:21:27] Revelation and then one day it will come
[1:21:29] out to perfect
[1:21:31] realization I believe this is the day
[1:21:33] that we are to understand the perfect
[1:21:35] realization amen there was times when I
[1:21:38] came into this message I had questions
[1:21:40] that I wanted to ask brother brandham
[1:21:42] you
[1:21:43] know about what he was just
[1:21:48] saying but now we ought to be like you
[1:21:53] know it's always said
[1:21:56] quote Beware of the man that's got all
[1:21:59] the
[1:22:00] answers that's a good
[1:22:03] quote but what about the other side of
[1:22:05] saying beware of them that don't have
[1:22:07] any answers at
[1:22:09] all you don't hear that see we make
[1:22:12] ignorance of what you call it a
[1:22:16] blessing and once you're pinned against
[1:22:18] the wall you say I don't understand well
[1:22:21] that's what Reagan said he had alimer
[1:22:25] you remember they get on to him about
[1:22:26] something he said I don't
[1:22:29] remember well that's easy thing he I
[1:22:32] don't
[1:22:34] remember but you you can't do nothing
[1:22:36] with me cuz I don't
[1:22:39] remember
[1:22:41] but if we said it we said it all right
[1:22:45] got to be but you understand what I'm
[1:22:47] trying to get
[1:22:48] to so in this series we're going to be
[1:22:51] taking some things and we're going to be
[1:22:54] dealing with them from a partial
[1:22:58] realization and we're going to try to
[1:23:00] come out to see a perfect
[1:23:03] realation of the message of the hour of
[1:23:05] the Bible and the things that we're
[1:23:07] we're talking about now let's start off
[1:23:10] with number one then I said it after
[1:23:12] these quotes see because if you read
[1:23:14] everything brother Brown says then
[1:23:16] you're going to read your question and
[1:23:18] then the next verse you're going to read
[1:23:19] your answer so I'm trying to make you
[1:23:22] know to the point of illustrating all
[1:23:25] right now brother
[1:23:30] random or
[1:23:32] Bible you
[1:23:34] know what is
[1:23:40] sin that's the subtitle for it what is
[1:23:47] sin well immediately your computer works
[1:23:50] in your brain right now you don't got it
[1:23:52] you got the answer seems
[1:23:59] unbelief that's
[1:24:01] good you we
[1:24:06] read but what if we come to the point of
[1:24:09] see
[1:24:11] that we do
[1:24:17] sin are we unbelievers
[1:24:26] what are
[1:24:27] we he said well we're unbeliever for the
[1:24:30] time now be careful on that because if
[1:24:32] you're trying to say you're unbeliever
[1:24:33] for a time you're saying that the hell
[1:24:37] was eternal and that's partial
[1:24:39] realization and now we know hell's not
[1:24:41] Eternal and that's perfect realization
[1:24:43] and I done told you that's not what I'm
[1:24:44] talking
[1:24:46] about that can't be partial realization
[1:24:49] of a trinity and this perfect
[1:24:50] realization to see one
[1:24:52] God that's totally are opposite to one
[1:24:55] the other that's not what brother around
[1:24:56] is explaining he's explaining the things
[1:24:58] in the Bible that are going to be
[1:25:00] understood from partial realization to
[1:25:03] perfect
[1:25:04] realization so you can't
[1:25:07] change you only increase in knowledge
[1:25:11] and
[1:25:14] Revelation come on you got to get off of
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:19] Trinity well brother you know I I
[1:25:22] believe the Trinity now believe one I
[1:25:24] just you know like one man said one time
[1:25:26] he said I shouted over the Trinity he
[1:25:28] said now I shout over one
[1:25:32] God I'm
[1:25:34] sorry I know I'm arogant and
[1:25:37] hateful but I thought evidently you
[1:25:39] didn't know much difference in the two
[1:25:42] cuz if you shouted over one you shouted
[1:25:43] over the other one you're telling me
[1:25:45] you're just shouting of what was
[1:25:46] something you shouted about that's right
[1:25:49] I'm
[1:25:50] sorry that's just the way I think
[1:25:55] you say what is sin do we
[1:26:02] sin be careful how you're bringing
[1:26:05] it because if you try to go out you run
[1:26:08] on the ground and you're going to run a
[1:26:10] ground to where that you're going to
[1:26:11] have a trinity out of something and
[1:26:13] thinking that your Trinity has turned
[1:26:15] into a one
[1:26:18] God you repent of a
[1:26:20] lie you repent of error
[1:26:25] you don't try to bring era over in well
[1:26:27] that was the way I believed
[1:26:30] it I mean I stand right here and tell
[1:26:32] you that when I was in the Baptist
[1:26:34] Church I argued like everything with him
[1:26:36] my brother's a Methodist trinitarian he
[1:26:38] was a trinitarian to the core fully
[1:26:40] believing in in three Gods you know and
[1:26:43] I was in the Baptist I'd argue with him
[1:26:45] like everything and tell him that ain't
[1:26:47] right the Bible says there's just one
[1:26:49] God
[1:26:52] right cuz that's basic Baptist Doctrine
[1:26:54] is one
[1:26:56] God but see when brother Mo said what do
[1:26:58] you believe I said God one true and
[1:27:01] living God he said explain it I said God
[1:27:03] in three persons Blessed Trinity he said
[1:27:05] you're as much Trinity as they
[1:27:07] are he said because a person a
[1:27:09] personality personality of individual
[1:27:11] individual person it didn't take me a
[1:27:13] week to figure it out I immediately
[1:27:14] looked at it and said I don't believe
[1:27:15] that no
[1:27:18] more see I repented of
[1:27:21] that it wasn't I tried to take what I
[1:27:24] used to believe and bring it over as the
[1:27:27] people of the message do and bring it
[1:27:29] over into the message and try to prove
[1:27:31] the message was saying that two Soul
[1:27:35] Doctrine ain't nothing in the world but
[1:27:36] a Mormon doctrine of
[1:27:40] pre-existence that's what it
[1:27:43] is you know you go out and try to find
[1:27:46] these new
[1:27:48] doctrines the River Jordan doctrine that
[1:27:50] said Jesus wasn't god Till The River
[1:27:52] Jordan that's an old doctrine that was
[1:27:54] back under yes that was an old doctor
[1:27:56] that nah yes sir cuz that was what they
[1:27:59] were arguing at 3:25 ad whether Jesus
[1:28:02] was the substance of God or a light
[1:28:05] substance that was 325 ad that's not new
[1:28:08] but see we try to come over and we say
[1:28:11] no I believe in repenting amen have you
[1:28:14] ever asked God to forgive you for
[1:28:17] believing a
[1:28:19] trinity well I really didn't know I
[1:28:21] needed to well now you
[1:28:22] do yes
[1:28:25] right but instead what you'll do is
[1:28:27] you'll incorporate that Trinity that you
[1:28:29] used to believe and then you'll find
[1:28:31] things of brother brandom that fits with
[1:28:33] what you used to believe and then you'll
[1:28:35] say this is what he was trying to
[1:28:39] say not the best thing do said I'm sorry
[1:28:42] Lord what I told Brother Mo when he told
[1:28:44] me that I said I don't believe that no
[1:28:46] more all right that ended my God in
[1:28:49] three persons Blessed
[1:28:51] Trinity well you just didn't have
[1:28:54] understanding that's all right but I'm
[1:28:55] still
[1:28:59] wrong see don't take when I didn't have
[1:29:01] understanding and try to justify you're
[1:29:07] wrong all right so you get into them
[1:29:10] little white
[1:29:13] lives but what is
[1:29:19] sin all
[1:29:21] right brother Brandon what is see
[1:29:24] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:29:26] 1965
[1:29:28] 11:25 page
[1:29:30] 38 what is
[1:29:33] sin sin is
[1:29:38] unbelief unbelief in
[1:29:40] God now listen sin is unbelief sin is
[1:29:45] unbelief unbelief in
[1:29:48] what that's what he said unbelief in
[1:29:51] what can remember how he explained it
[1:29:54] Eve never disbelieved
[1:29:57] God the devil couldn't do
[1:29:59] that she disb believed his
[1:30:02] word what is sin sin is unbelief
[1:30:05] unbelief in what the
[1:30:08] word unbelief in
[1:30:11] God which is the
[1:30:14] word pure
[1:30:17] unadulterated amen
[1:30:20] unbelief in God which is the word
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:26] okay
[1:30:30] now okay brother randam what is
[1:30:32] sin then we'll get to it in a minute
[1:30:34] I'll give you I'll give you some
[1:30:36] scriptures when we get on
[1:30:40] down try to interrelate the scriptures
[1:30:43] with u you
[1:30:46] know so you see this is not what brother
[1:30:49] brandham
[1:30:50] believed if brother brandham taught us
[1:30:52] anything contrary to the Bible he's
[1:30:54] false prophet right any man any person
[1:30:57] teaches anything contrary to the word of
[1:30:58] God me you whoever it is Pope priest
[1:31:01] king
[1:31:04] who he's
[1:31:07] wrong that's where we don't believe that
[1:31:08] brother random was God no
[1:31:12] that's we just believe he brought the
[1:31:14] message of the hour what do you
[1:31:17] believe well I'm a Pentecostal well who
[1:31:20] brought the message to the
[1:31:22] Pentecostals amen
[1:31:24] you believe in
[1:31:26] somebody all
[1:31:28] right so now watch this is offer Inner
[1:31:32] Man 1953
[1:31:37] 1212 he said what is sin brother
[1:31:41] brandham well today I tell you I lost my
[1:31:46] temper I'm reading what he said
[1:31:50] here now wait just a minute
[1:31:54] sin is
[1:31:56] unbelief now that's what sin
[1:31:59] is there's no other
[1:32:03] sin but
[1:32:07] unbelief it's not a sin to do things
[1:32:10] like drinking and smoking and gambling
[1:32:12] and prostitution that's not
[1:32:15] sin that's the result of sin right
[1:32:19] that's the reason you do that is because
[1:32:21] you're an unbeliever
[1:32:27] H you'll hear him using this scripture
[1:32:29] John
[1:32:31] 3:18 he that believeth not is
[1:32:35] what condemned
[1:32:40] already he that believeth not is
[1:32:42] condemned
[1:32:44] already Hebrews 10 and
[1:32:47] 26 that was John
[1:32:50] 3:18 Hebrews
[1:32:52] 10:26 if we see sin willfully after
[1:32:55] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[1:32:56] there remaineth no more
[1:33:01] sacrifice that's
[1:33:08] Bible okay so what is
[1:33:12] sin sin is
[1:33:15] unbelief in the word of God which is
[1:33:19] God right yeah
[1:33:24] the condemnation is because of
[1:33:32] unbelief now it's not lack of believing
[1:33:34] God understand that now just just make
[1:33:36] sure you get that right it's not the
[1:33:38] lack of
[1:33:39] believing you know lack of hearing but
[1:33:43] don't hold you responsible for what you
[1:33:44] hadn't heard now don't don't go wrong
[1:33:46] with it see it's only what you hear is
[1:33:48] what you're responsible for I got a
[1:33:50] quote at the house laying on the desk
[1:33:51] when brother R said when you when you
[1:33:53] see it you know it's true he said you
[1:33:55] turn it down you're an
[1:33:58] unbeliever all right but
[1:34:01] now what is sin sin is
[1:34:05] unbelief all right now the prophet that
[1:34:09] answered that question what is sin let's
[1:34:12] ask that same Prophet the
[1:34:15] question do we sin brother
[1:34:20] Brandon do you sin
[1:34:32] okay let's see if I can find which one
[1:34:35] was supposed to be on I should have read
[1:34:37] that other one I'll read it right now on
[1:34:38] a Ministry explain
[1:34:40] 19571 what is sin what is sin not
[1:34:43] drinking not smoking not gambling but
[1:34:46] not rejecting Church sin is unbelief is
[1:34:49] that right he that believeth not is
[1:34:50] condemned already see you're you're you
[1:34:53] do not
[1:34:54] you do not you're you're not destroyed
[1:34:57] or separated from God because you're a
[1:34:59] sinner you're separated from from to to
[1:35:02] God from God because you refuse to walk
[1:35:05] with him to walk in his provided way now
[1:35:09] you remember what they said to to
[1:35:10] brother brandham you know the lady when
[1:35:12] he kept saying and preaching you know
[1:35:13] that that sin is not dranking gambling
[1:35:15] smok and run around this lady finally
[1:35:17] stood up said well brother Brandon what
[1:35:19] is
[1:35:20] sin you know he was saying it he said
[1:35:23] sin's unel
[1:35:24] believe he said you do them things
[1:35:26] because you're an
[1:35:27] unbeliever now you claim to be a
[1:35:29] believer and go out and do them things
[1:35:30] while you got you got a
[1:35:33] problem but brother
[1:35:36] brandom do we
[1:35:40] sin
[1:35:42] okay Hebrews chapter page paragraph 209
[1:35:46] of Hebrews chapter 6 1957
[1:35:50] 908 he's in Hebrews there where it's
[1:35:52] talking about the princip is a doctrine
[1:35:54] of Christ let's going to Perfection now
[1:35:56] we got that this morning how that we are
[1:35:59] perfect perfected absolutely spotless
[1:36:02] and
[1:36:05] blameless now
[1:36:07] listen not one sin on
[1:36:12] us are you above Temptation never do you
[1:36:16] sin every
[1:36:18] day yes sir
[1:36:25] do you see him yes sir every
[1:36:32] day now what are you going to use
[1:36:39] there
[1:36:46] okay trying to find I wanted to reread
[1:36:48] one in here somewhere but I'll get it in
[1:36:49] a
[1:36:51] minute contending for the faith 1956
[1:36:55] 0202 we're tempted all of us are tempted
[1:37:00] all of us
[1:37:02] sin there's none without
[1:37:06] sin every day you
[1:37:10] sin now
[1:37:12] listen Paul said he had to Die
[1:37:15] daily that's First Corinthians
[1:37:20] 15:31 Paul said we got to Die daily
[1:37:27] and if we say we we sin we have no sin
[1:37:32] then the Bible says we make God to
[1:37:38] lie we sin
[1:37:43] daily 1 John 1 18-10 read
[1:37:49] it let's just read that first John
[1:38:01] 1 8 through
[1:38:04] 10 you said want to read this other one
[1:38:06] okay we're going to read the other
[1:38:10] one but if we're going read this one you
[1:38:14] don't know what the other one is
[1:38:19] saying 1 John
[1:38:21] 1:8 if we say that we have no sin we
[1:38:26] deceive
[1:38:27] ourselves and the truth is not in
[1:38:34] us if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:38:38] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:38:40] cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[1:38:43] we say that we have not sinned we make
[1:38:46] him a liar and his word is not in us
[1:38:50] right that's Bible
[1:38:54] see people say I always was eternal well
[1:38:57] that make you an eternal sinner because
[1:38:58] that's what you are right so we got a
[1:39:01] problem right amen now brother bradam
[1:39:06] said that we all
[1:39:12] sin he said every day we
[1:39:17] sin brother Ram you did you you sin
[1:39:20] every day he said
[1:39:21] yes and he said Paul
[1:39:25] said I got to Die daily because I
[1:39:28] sin you remember the things I would not
[1:39:30] I do not the things I do not I would not
[1:39:32] and all you know all that that's Paul
[1:39:35] explaining it was Paul an
[1:39:40] unbeliever was brother Bram an
[1:39:44] unbeliever see we're not even talking
[1:39:46] about me and you we just use somebody
[1:39:48] else right there somebody you look at
[1:39:50] and say for sure we know this that or
[1:39:51] the other about them
[1:40:00] Jesus told the Pharisees John 9948 I
[1:40:03] think it
[1:40:04] is he told the Pharisees he said if I
[1:40:07] hadn't spoken unto
[1:40:11] you that you had a
[1:40:14] covering he said now that I
[1:40:17] spoke your sin
[1:40:19] remaineth now what about a group of
[1:40:22] people they and if they have been one
[1:40:24] Mark against the high priest Etc they
[1:40:27] would have killed him and yet Jesus was
[1:40:30] saying he was a
[1:40:32] sinner they were real good to say we're
[1:40:35] not sinning like all the others you
[1:40:39] know but the Bible said they
[1:40:43] were all
[1:40:45] right so are we
[1:40:50] unbelievers what do you say
[1:41:00] are we
[1:41:02] Sinners are we
[1:41:08] unbelievers well Jesus said unless your
[1:41:11] righteousness
[1:41:13] exceeds the righteousness of the scribes
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:17] Pharisees the guys that Jesus told them
[1:41:20] they were sinners
[1:41:24] unless your righteousness exceed the
[1:41:27] scribes and Pharisees you won't enter
[1:41:28] Heaven right is that
[1:41:31] scripture did he say the one that always
[1:41:34] is argued over you know in Matthew 5:48
[1:41:37] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:41:39] in Heaven is
[1:41:41] perfect that's been argued all down
[1:41:43] through right
[1:41:45] now with definitions of words
[1:41:54] but yet how could we be
[1:41:56] perfect if we're
[1:42:00] Sinners are we perfect
[1:42:03] Sinners I wouldn't want to go that way I
[1:42:07] think we was I think that's the way we
[1:42:09] was born perfect
[1:42:11] Sinners bunch of people trying to
[1:42:13] straighten out the word of God instead
[1:42:14] of believing what God Said or try to
[1:42:16] straighten out this message instead of
[1:42:17] believing what the prophet said perfect
[1:42:19] Cy I agree with
[1:42:21] that but see we like to read all the
[1:42:24] other
[1:42:25] things we like to read
[1:42:28] things
[1:42:30] that you
[1:42:34] know we like to read something like this
[1:42:37] that I just got through Reading part of
[1:42:41] it paragraph 208 Hebrews chapter 6 57
[1:42:46] 98 you talking about we got it this
[1:42:48] morning how that we are
[1:42:51] perfect per
[1:42:53] fected absolutely spotless and blameless
[1:42:57] not one sin
[1:42:58] onless are you above Temptation never do
[1:43:02] you sin every day yes
[1:43:05] sir but yet we are
[1:43:11] perfected now I'm continue to
[1:43:13] read because we are in him yes and God
[1:43:18] could no more judge us than
[1:43:21] nothing he could couldn't be righteous
[1:43:24] he's already judged Us in him when he
[1:43:27] judged Christ he judged me he judged you
[1:43:31] and he can't judge me again because he
[1:43:33] took my judgment that's the ones we
[1:43:37] like
[1:43:41] right I was reading in this brother
[1:43:43] Brown used it a lot of times Armenian
[1:43:45] and and calvinistic you know right
[1:43:48] because one of them you know believe
[1:43:50] it's okay do anything in the world
[1:43:51] you're saved anyway Calvin I think the
[1:43:53] other one believes you you better make
[1:43:54] sure if things right cuz if you're right
[1:43:56] on your knees when you die you go to
[1:43:58] heaven if you ain't on your knees you
[1:43:59] got problems oh
[1:44:01] my it's good Methodist
[1:44:04] Doctrine but now
[1:44:07] listen we like to read these serpent
[1:44:11] seed
[1:44:12] 1958 9:28 evening
[1:44:16] service did not David say blessed is the
[1:44:19] man to whom God will not reckon sin
[1:44:22] that's Roman
[1:44:23] something Romans 4
[1:44:29] 6-8 God will not Recon sin and impute
[1:44:31] sin
[1:44:32] to God don't hold a sin against this
[1:44:37] creature that's strong he said that's
[1:44:39] not skim milk God will not reckon sin to
[1:44:43] the
[1:44:45] righteous
[1:44:47] okay we like
[1:44:50] this questions and answerers 1959
[1:44:53] 628 the evening service will you explain
[1:44:56] what it means by sinth not in 1 John
[1:45:03] 518 certainly not who's ever born of God
[1:45:06] sinth not certainly not I just went
[1:45:08] through that he can't sin he's born of
[1:45:11] God sinth not he can't sin but seed
[1:45:16] remains in him another scripture we
[1:45:18] might refer to here would be Romans 4 uh
[1:45:20] 8 which is 4 and 5-8
[1:45:23] where God David spoke over there years
[1:45:26] ago and said blessed is the man to whom
[1:45:28] God will not impute
[1:45:30] sin because he does not
[1:45:37] sin token 1964
[1:45:44] 308 shows that God hasn't recognized
[1:45:48] your
[1:45:50] sin now the promises makes free from sin
[1:45:53] shows that God hasn't hasn't recognized
[1:45:56] your sin David said blessed is the man
[1:45:58] to whom God will not impute sin and God
[1:46:01] will never impute sin over that
[1:46:03] token because it's the token it's the
[1:46:06] paid sign that God has already received
[1:46:11] it
[1:46:13] okay see the descriptions
[1:46:16] c651 or
[1:46:19] 118 not even sin is imputed to a genuine
[1:46:22] unbeliever did you know that he that's
[1:46:25] born of God does not commit sin he
[1:46:27] cannot sin see it's not even imputed
[1:46:31] when David said blessed is the man to
[1:46:33] whom God will not impute sin when you're
[1:46:35] in Christ you have no desire to sin the
[1:46:37] worshipper once Purge has no more
[1:46:40] conscience to sin you don't desire it
[1:46:42] now to the world you might be a sinner
[1:46:44] but to God you're not because you're in
[1:46:46] Christ how can you be in a be in a
[1:46:49] sinner when you're in the sinless one
[1:46:52] and God only sees him who you are
[1:46:56] in on the wings of a dove 1965 11:28 and
[1:47:00] that's the way with the real Christian
[1:47:03] did you know a real Christian doesn't
[1:47:04] have any sin at all imputed to him David
[1:47:08] said blessed is a man to whom God will
[1:47:09] not impute sin when you're washed in the
[1:47:12] blood of the Lamb not by make believe
[1:47:14] but really the blood of the Lamb God
[1:47:17] does not impute to you anything that's
[1:47:19] done because you're under the blood and
[1:47:21] he doesn't use it
[1:47:23] there's a blood sacrifice the only thing
[1:47:25] he can see you in is the way that he saw
[1:47:28] you before the foundation of the world
[1:47:30] when he put your name in the loue that's
[1:47:33] all that he can look at because you are
[1:47:36] redeemed from everything that was ever
[1:47:38] done you're washed in the blood of the
[1:47:40] Lamb therefore there is no G in you g
[1:47:45] excuse me in you there is no unclean
[1:47:48] Habit in you because that the blood of
[1:47:50] the Lamb has did this and God canot not
[1:47:53] impute sin to you after you've got a sin
[1:47:56] offering laying there waiting for
[1:47:58] you we like those quotes don't we
[1:48:01] questions and answers
[1:48:03] 58628 do Christians sin absolutely no it
[1:48:09] must have f up on a battery again we
[1:48:12] thought we had this thing worked out
[1:48:14] that's
[1:48:16] only but we didn't do
[1:48:18] it but we still got this on Amen
[1:48:21] absolutely not know there is no
[1:48:23] scripture where a Christian
[1:48:25] sins he cannot sin I know there's
[1:48:29] resentment to that well we'll just go to
[1:48:33] First John 3 and see what the scripture
[1:48:35] says about it so what does it say over
[1:48:37] there it says his seed remaineth in him
[1:48:40] and he cannot
[1:48:41] sin all right now brother
[1:48:46] Brandon you said you sin and we all
[1:48:50] sin you said Paul sin
[1:48:53] had to Die
[1:48:55] daily
[1:48:57] now you're saying that we're
[1:49:06] perfect and then we can't
[1:49:12] sin well I'll take
[1:49:16] this that's what you
[1:49:18] do I'll take the scriptures and the
[1:49:21] quotes
[1:49:24] I'll go on the scriptures and quotes it
[1:49:26] says I'm
[1:49:28] perfect well what about the things it
[1:49:30] says you're not
[1:49:39] perfect well brother Dale I I'll take
[1:49:42] where brother brand in the Bible says
[1:49:43] that I don't
[1:49:45] sin well what about the ones where the
[1:49:48] Prophet said you did
[1:49:55] I take where it said I can't be an
[1:49:57] unbeliever the prophet says you are an
[1:50:02] unbeliever the Bible says you
[1:50:05] are now what are we going to
[1:50:09] do are we going to take what we
[1:50:16] want then those things that are
[1:50:20] true you're facing
[1:50:25] see brother Brandon was just like Paul I
[1:50:27] love to read Paul because to me that
[1:50:29] you'd have to you know that the Baptist
[1:50:30] where Paul was saying the things I would
[1:50:32] not I do not and the things I do I would
[1:50:34] not and all back and forth you know what
[1:50:37] the Baptist teach they said Paul
[1:50:39] wouldn't born again till he got that
[1:50:41] scripture you mean he wrote the Bible
[1:50:45] but he wasn't born again till he got
[1:50:46] that scripture so when he finally got to
[1:50:48] that scripture he got born again now
[1:50:50] Paul was explaining to Everyday Life of
[1:50:52] a human
[1:50:54] being that when we want to do good evil
[1:50:56] is
[1:50:58] present I want to do right Satan TR to
[1:51:01] hinder
[1:51:03] me brother brand I'm coming along that's
[1:51:05] what caught me so much with it is the
[1:51:07] honest and sincerity of a
[1:51:10] man that would tell you we do wrong
[1:51:13] every
[1:51:15] day we sin every
[1:51:20] day all right so now what we're going to
[1:51:22] do is we're going to try to justify or
[1:51:27] explain
[1:51:32] that there's got to be many many
[1:51:34] different
[1:51:36] sins
[1:51:38] yeah you know so this one is sin but
[1:51:42] this one is sin and this one is
[1:51:45] sin no we just all sin all the
[1:51:49] way CU you can't explain it with the one
[1:51:54] the children of Israel glory in the fact
[1:51:56] that they kept the word of God what are
[1:51:58] you glory
[1:52:01] in the high priest gloried in that he
[1:52:04] kept the word of God turned around and
[1:52:06] killed the word of
[1:52:10] God because he knew Jesus was talking
[1:52:13] different than him amen now let me say
[1:52:17] it to you that high priest those priests
[1:52:21] knew that they made
[1:52:27] mistakes now come on just be human I
[1:52:29] mean don't you don't think that
[1:52:30] everybody back in the Old Testament
[1:52:32] thought everything was okey
[1:52:38] doie well they knew they were people
[1:52:41] problem but they had already analyzed
[1:52:44] the thing and come up with a sensible
[1:52:48] answer that there must be things that
[1:52:53] is not much counted
[1:52:58] sin and we don't put it in the category
[1:53:00] of sin we put it in a category of
[1:53:05] life that's all right cuz that's where
[1:53:08] we're
[1:53:12] at was brother Ram an
[1:53:16] unbeliever was Paul an unbeliever
[1:53:22] was Jesus an
[1:53:24] unbeliever when he planted ropes and run
[1:53:26] them out of the temple and brother
[1:53:28] randam said had a
[1:53:34] temper you say brother Dale you I I walk
[1:53:37] where I walk Come
[1:53:39] On Jesus got anger and run him out of
[1:53:42] the
[1:53:44] temple was that an anger of Godly
[1:53:50] anger now he got upset
[1:53:58] he was angry at the fact of what they
[1:53:59] were
[1:54:02] doing so now you're saying that Jesus
[1:54:05] done wrong I didn't say that cuz I don't
[1:54:08] say you do wrong I say we're human
[1:54:10] beings and we live in a life and it's
[1:54:13] impossible to live in this life without
[1:54:15] human
[1:54:19] problems but we got to come to a
[1:54:21] conclusion of the matter have about 10
[1:54:24] minutes till
[1:54:26] 12 what is the conclusion of the matter
[1:54:29] then Paul what is the conclusion of the
[1:54:31] matter brother Brandon what is the
[1:54:34] conclusion of the matter that we must
[1:54:35] draw a
[1:54:38] conclusion you know the Bible speaks
[1:54:40] that there is a sin under death I don't
[1:54:42] have time to cover all this I'll just
[1:54:44] quote the Bible says there's a sin unto
[1:54:47] death that you don't pray
[1:54:49] for right
[1:54:53] it says there a sin in other words if
[1:54:54] somebody's committed over to the Lord
[1:54:56] for the destruction of the flesh you
[1:54:58] can't pray for them that's right well
[1:55:00] you mean to tell me I can't pray for him
[1:55:01] well contrary the Bible if you do that's
[1:55:04] cuz you're not letting God use his wrath
[1:55:06] that's right well brother d That's my
[1:55:09] people that's my I don't care if it's my
[1:55:12] if it's my kids or my wife or or me or
[1:55:14] who it is it's having to do you got to
[1:55:16] do what God says do amen right you
[1:55:19] commit your children into the hand of
[1:55:21] God as quick as he starts beating on oh
[1:55:23] I didn't mean it that
[1:55:27] way I didn't mean you to do it that bad
[1:55:30] brother around said let them lay on the
[1:55:31] flat of their back amen and look
[1:55:37] up they quote a
[1:55:40] lot that's
[1:55:42] right we're not supposed to pray for no
[1:55:44] you're not supposed to pray for somebody
[1:55:46] that this church says we've turned them
[1:55:48] over for the destruction of the flesh if
[1:55:50] you pray for that person anymore after
[1:55:51] then you are wrong in the Bible that's
[1:55:55] right but that's not forever sin because
[1:55:58] the Bible doesn't say that that's the
[1:56:00] sin that is under death right there is
[1:56:03] other sin that people do that you pray
[1:56:05] for
[1:56:08] right that's the same word
[1:56:12] sin but one of them is unto death and if
[1:56:14] they don't straighten up they die and
[1:56:16] you know where they
[1:56:19] go of course if they're a Christian they
[1:56:21] straighten up but then if it's a point
[1:56:23] in air that they don't straighten up and
[1:56:24] they are a Christian which would be a
[1:56:26] very rare
[1:56:28] occasion then it could be the
[1:56:29] destruction of the
[1:56:32] flesh but you see we want to use
[1:56:34] everyone little Avenue we want for our
[1:56:37] own benefit instead of looking at
[1:56:39] something straight up front like brother
[1:56:41] random did Brother random do you sin he
[1:56:43] said every
[1:56:45] day brother random you're perfect he
[1:56:47] said yes siry
[1:56:52] brother random do you disbelieve God's
[1:56:54] word he said show me where I
[1:56:56] do now you want them
[1:56:59] quotes do you need him that brother RAM
[1:57:01] and not only the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus
[1:57:03] said show me where that I've ever
[1:57:07] disbelieved you ain't never been reading
[1:57:09] enough of brother brandom to understand
[1:57:11] he was saying the same thing to those
[1:57:12] Pentecostal when he said come show me
[1:57:14] where I'm off the
[1:57:16] word show me where I
[1:57:20] disbelieved you know that we can stand
[1:57:22] in that same place and say that same
[1:57:24] thing show me where I'm off the
[1:57:26] world show me where I
[1:57:29] sin the category of sin is unbelief show
[1:57:32] me where it's
[1:57:34] at but brother Dale you admited you yep
[1:57:38] mhm I admit I'm a sinner saved by
[1:57:43] grace so there is some things about Sin
[1:57:46] that it will not destroy
[1:57:48] you that does not signify that you
[1:57:51] disbelieve God God's
[1:57:54] word but it signifies you're going to
[1:57:56] get a
[1:57:59] weapon to get lined up right
[1:58:04] amen now I'll review this after um this
[1:58:09] Wednesday cuz I want you to
[1:58:12] understand brother R said we sin every
[1:58:15] day that's but then he says we don't
[1:58:20] sin the script scri says we sin every
[1:58:23] day and if we say we don't have sin
[1:58:25] we're
[1:58:27] liow and the scripture says we're
[1:58:29] perfect right same man the little John
[1:58:33] guy over there you know writing he's
[1:58:35] same one that wrote that you know that
[1:58:37] was perfect did he see remain of in so
[1:58:40] what is it that makes us to wor that
[1:58:42] we're not
[1:58:44] sinners sinners of unbelief in God's
[1:58:47] word what is it that makes us to that
[1:58:49] there's only one thing and that's the
[1:58:50] new birth
[1:58:53] because that puts the teacher inside of
[1:58:55] you Hallelujah and that teacher inside
[1:58:58] of you can't be contrary to God's word
[1:59:01] right that's right but are you going to
[1:59:04] live a life of
[1:59:07] perfection not in yourself
[1:59:10] no we're going to do
[1:59:13] wrong but then we turn around and say
[1:59:15] well I can't help it now the prophet
[1:59:17] says you prove you're a sinner cuz if
[1:59:20] you say you can't help it you what
[1:59:22] you're doing you're denying God's word
[1:59:24] that's right because he said I made a
[1:59:26] way yes like I've always told you he
[1:59:29] didn't have problems with the children
[1:59:31] of Israel 10 times they sinned before
[1:59:33] they got to Cades Baria he was still
[1:59:36] taking them to the promised land in the
[1:59:38] great sins that they were
[1:59:40] doing but when they got to cadis Baria
[1:59:43] and disbelieved him as the ability to
[1:59:45] take them
[1:59:47] over he said to the Wilderness you go
[1:59:50] and will die there
[1:59:56] why because they had become Sinners
[1:59:58] that's right their sins they had
[2:00:01] committed down through there was not
[2:00:03] recorded too
[2:00:07] much could be gotten
[2:00:10] over as human beings you
[2:00:15] know but when you disbelieve God's
[2:00:20] word brother R said when you say that
[2:00:24] that's God when brother random is is is
[2:00:28] uh praying for the sick that that's
[2:00:32] God and then when you say that you don't
[2:00:35] believe him when he's the doctorine he
[2:00:38] preaches he said that is
[2:00:42] sin and we'll have to be reckoned of
[2:00:47] it do we get by with sin because we're a
[2:00:50] Christian no we got cover that right why
[2:00:54] because there's a judgment of the Deeds
[2:00:55] Done in the body whether good and bad if
[2:00:57] we don't repent of them in this world
[2:00:58] we're going to have to give an account
[2:01:00] that's
[2:01:01] Bible well what do you mean giving
[2:01:03] account I'm
[2:01:08] perfect according to who's looking at
