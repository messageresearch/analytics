remember the fellas the ministers meeting waiting to be going will be the second Saturday in May and then the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday in May I talked to brother Ernie Villanueva yesterday he is having a lot of trouble with that big word neuropathies or what it is with his feet and he's looking at not going to be able to come I told him I said well we're going to pray that you can so he's supposed to let me know you know pretty quick about it but we will have somebody speaking but you know let's pray that the Lord will touch him and let everything be all right because we believe it right amen you ready to hear the word of the Lord I'm glad to have brother Paul back with us he said he'd had a heart attack since he'd been gone and brother Doherty didn't get us the message because that was the only one he could call but lady's doing better so just just pray that brother give you bring us the word of the lord it's not because that's what we gathered for right Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart amen pour out your power in love as we sing Holy Holy Holy oh amen he's holy he makes us holy man amen if you'd like to turn your turn with me to scriptures turn with me to Psalms 23. yep and I lost my glasses looks like y'all look up here you know what y'all in for tonight now don't you hey I'm terrible about this yeah anyway we're going to read the scriptures anyway well no I don't need those brother I tell you it's a it's a grand thing to be here today it's uh to meet with brothers and sisters will like Precious faith we pray Lord that that we can say something that'll that'll help you we got to I I do realize that it's not just coming to church we are the church we bring the church with us we bring God with us so we need to brother Brown said made a statement I've never forgotten and and I've I've looked for it and uh I've seen it ever since he baptized me with the Holy Spirit he said if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse he said reads again you miss something so I'm gonna I'm gonna see if I can by the grace of God that maybe I don't know how this is going to work out I've never I'm not used to this I'm used to just kind of like kind of like brother 40 you know just kind of hits a starter and go but I'd like to read this and I'd like to start putting my life in putting your life in in putting the son of man's life into the scriptures and bringing it out because somewhere there's a people on the face of this Earth that's predestinated for ordained to fulfill this position and we can only do it by seeing what the word is and who he is what he's done and what he's doing now and what he'll always do there is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today or forever I was saying about brother uh Sam when he uh he took that scripture uh Hebrews 13 5 and 7 or 5-9 and and I was seeing now I don't I don't know how other people I can only speak for myself but I was seeing when he was reading that I was seeing it through spiritualizing God God blessed me then can I put that in this scripture will it will he come to this scripture now let's just read this and let's just pray about his moment before we get started here father in the precious name of Jesus Christ again we say Lord God just be with us and help us Lord God let your servant just step aside father God did we can we can say seals we can say Thunders we can say trumpets we can say but at all is Jesus Christ God just help us father to bring you on the scene Lord God and let the people see in their own life who you are and what you've done for him father and what you're going to do in the name of Jesus Christ we committed to that into thy holy hands amen Let's uh read this and we'll get started here maybe if I I don't think I'm going to be too long but you know how that goes the Lord is my shepherd now I'm gonna just I'm going to read this I'm gonna let you set it on that because I got quite a few scriptures I want to read but and then I want to comment on this right here and I want to try to to bring you to a reality to you now he said with the Lord is my shepherd the first thing we think about is David David but see I believe it was somebody in David was saying this I believe that God had a man to say this and pin this and it put it in the description that one day in 19 or 2000 so there would be somebody that would pick us up and see that this was them right that I don't mean just just that he's my shepherd see he is my shepherd He is my Lord he is my God he is this he is Hebrew 13 8. listen down now we're going we're going to go to this in the next scripture we're going to see if this here fits now the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want now if you've got the new birth now you have been Justified and Sanctified and you have the new birth there Comes A Time in your life that you don't want the world in the ways of the world you want God in God alone now let's just walk it down a little bit he makes me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters the pastors the word that this quietness and the and the the Stillness of the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you when you're in turmoil all manner of things is going on that he is holding you and you're seeing it in this scripture because when you see this scripture fulfilled here you're seeing Daniel 9 24 made manifest which is a son of man because he's the only one that that can bring this to into operation or to into completeness now uh I'm I'm just I'm going to try to speak about my experience I I noticed that that Brother Sam every time brother Wade in the ministry but about brother Aaron and I and I watch him and I watch it coming down it's just like when Brother Sam was it was bringing this Sunday I I watched it it's a spiritual part of it fit right in the description that God had given me now I hope and pray with all my heart that God will show you these things it will bring it to you because there's things that we are preordained predestinated to fulfilled and nobody has ever did this before as a church what we have got to do and it's going to take the complete revelation of the son of man almighty God to bring us into operation or to completeness now it's I mean he made me to lie down in Green Pastures he brings me he brings me he I can see him in my in my life I said I was going to read and let y'all go and that's what I'm gonna do excuse me I mean this he's making me to lie down in green passion he leads me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his namesake this is my shepherd and your Shepherd Lord that's doing this yeah though I walk through the valley of the shatter of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod in thy staff that covered me thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you can be seated and then let's just back up here just in just a moment before before we move on now he restoreth my soul he give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he showed you how he give you the baptism holy ghost He restored your soul he brought you back from the pits of hell where that we all deserved this but by God's grace and mercy he looked down from Glory by by and seen his attributes down here and seen what they would do and what they were and he said that made his mind up of course we know it was always made up but he so he said I'm going to bring him in and I'm going I'm by this what I see here I have elected him and I'm going to bring him to the place that he's gonna I'm gonna bring him back and show him where I put his name on my blind book of life before the foundation of the world you and I Church before we make a change in the body in the rapture we gonna see that and if we don't see that we better get busy right now it's right here in the scriptures boy he's working at me he won't see I'd like to I'd like to be talking about the Thunders and you know what they do and that's what I'm doing in the Simplicity of the word is where God always reveals himself and he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death now from the moment that you was conceived in your mother's womb the shadow of death started on you and I God by his mercy and Grace gave you an angel right there if you don't believe it what about John the Baptist right he knew that if there what Satan was going to do to you and by that he put your name on the last book of life before the foundation word that you couldn't be lost now when most people seize that they they I had a guy tell me one time was it a charismatic movement he said the way you teach that brother Gibby is you're teaching some that's lost and some that's saved I said no you got me wrong I said God gives everybody he puts everybody on a free mobile agency yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you we must see this I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you what'd he say there he said my rod and my staff they comfort me what is this if you go to if you look at it for seal there he said hurt not my oil in my wine so he's got you covered regardless of what you're going through with how old you get how broke down you get right at the output to Paris the table before me in the presence of my enemy what table is that what table is that yeah what table is that in the presence of your enemy he has restored your soul and led you in a path of righteousness bringing you to this position and this place tonight that you can absolutely see God in action I see it every every time we come up here that prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointed my head with all my cup runneth over now if you'll just see this if you read description if you'll study this scripture you'll see your justification you'll see your sanctification you'll see your baptism the Holy Spirit where he filled your soul right here you see where he's he's become your Shepherd and he's anointed you he has prepared you with his with his word and he has brought you his bringing you if he's not brought you to the Statue of the perfect man right here in this scripture he he prepares you see it's right here there prepares a table a table a table of the word before me in the presence of mine enemy is that anoints my head with oil my cup runneth over see to me right here is where he comes and the headship comes on and he anointed my head with oil he Anointed The the anointed there at the River Jordan and he come forth and preached them seals I hope you see it surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever when this right here is completed when this scripture right here is completed now let's uh let's uh go to uh Hebrews 13 and read just a uh what the scripture says on that let me go ahead and do it this way we'll uh we'll get going here a little bit all right this uh let's start here at uh at the fifth verse and uh oh God it's hard to start let your car let's hit the field let's just go ahead let your conversation be without Covetous and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake do you remember the scripture I just read here he said he would never leave you and he'd never forsake you you must see Church you must see that you've got a job to do and he's promised you that he would be with you and he would do this job he would absolutely make you what he wants you to be what he saw you before there was a foundation in the world he saw you as what you are exactly remember them which have to rule over you see he said I said in the church Apostles prophets evangelists passes and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints till we all come to the Statue of the perfect man the units of the faith Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now he says here by this here happening be not carried about we're divers and strange doctrines and I might say this there's and and I I hesitate and uh to to but we spend more time in the world than we do with Jesus Christ I said we now but you know I carried about with divers are strange let's let me say this where do we have more faith in in doctors in medicines or God think about it just think about it Susan see praise God see we we have to come to the position brother blatter me one time when he was shot up and he was he was drinking he had been shot and was taking all that medicine and and and just drinking milk and bread and or whatever he was he decided one time he said the word of God says he's the same yesterday today and forever and we the stripes I'm Healed and he walked off of there eating and spitting up between his face his fingers now I've tried that before it didn't work for me but now I wonder if I had stayed with it I'd like to die I quit taking this and I quit taking everything I told Brother somebody he didn't tell me not to do it he told me just know what I was doing I like to die now I couldn't have died I'm standing here so I didn't I didn't persevere I know I but I did tell the Lord something I said Lord if I ever do that again you'll tell me but maybe he was telling me and I just didn't know that but anyway Jesus Christ the same yesterday and fair be cared not about with divers and strange doctors for is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with me which have not profited them that have been occupied therein okay let me hear let me read this one right here now and then let me just go here I still I'm just trying to get myself together let your conversation be without coveters and be content with such things as you have or you have I I would never leave enough for safety the Lord is my helper I will now fear what man shall do to me remember them which have the rule over you have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith father considered the end of their conversation the manner of Life Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever be not carried about with divers and strange doctors for is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein now I want to go to he uh Isaiah 43 1. I want to just kind of pick up the Pacey if I can now if you can't see Jesus Christ in every verse right you miss something read it again now I I I preach more out of the Old Testament than really I believe that I have in the new uh because Paul uh he he went into Arabia and studied for three and a half years or so and come out and preach 14 I mean 14 uh uh books in the New Testament where'd he get them at he get them right here brother I just read what bro Brown said he said he said and I thought this one time well Pig and I had went to bed one night when we lived in Duluth and uh I was laying there because she always went to sleep for me and I just laying there thinking talking to the Lord about it about about his word and I looked up and I Saw an Eagle coming let me just tell you what happened an ego coming and it and it come and when it got about where this clock is right there he just turned into this black Bible right here and was like this right here and come right into my bosom now I appreciate God for those little things uh uh if you want to call them little things but uh God is being blessed he has really blessed me he is he is he's given me uh his word and I can see it into in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament but let's just read that start read here the first verse first third chapter of Isaiah but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob that's me you that formed thee Oh is wrong that's you and me fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine amen now has he done this when I pass this through the waters the peoples the world when I passed when thou passes through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers floods things seems to be just running over you I mean pushing you down I mean all manner of evil is is coming against you and the people I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee see he promised you I'll never be I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you see when thou walkest through the fire thy shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee to really to damage you now that don't mean it won't get hot and it it might leave some scars but it ain't going to take you away from here for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thou Ransom Egypt's world Ethiopian and seeba for these world since that was precious in my sight thy has been honorable and I have lived thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thou life now I'm seeing I'm seeing the bride here I'm not talking about thousands of years ago which did that happen right right for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the west and the first thing people they see Israel they see but see we come from the East and the West I will say to the north to give up and give to the South and to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth either everyone that is called by my name amen I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him now we can go back into predestination we can go back into what uh uh uh Hebrews 13 5-9 right there and put it right in the Book of Psalms right there and go and and just it's just bring it down to that but but let me continue bring forth the blind people now let's see if it fits our day bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the death that have ears religious people right people that says they're in this message following this message let not all the nations be gathered together let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their Witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord now I'm saying a witness not just uh uh even like with brother Paul Peter John but we're a witness of a part of redemption that them brothers didn't know we come to a position in a place through experience that when he says here ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen predestination by election God's looked down and seen where he was at and were brought us so election looks to foreknowledge foreknowledge is in my soul called a baptism of Holy Ghost for now these looks to predestination predestination looks to Destiny we this is revealed to us church this is made known to us somebody here on the face of this Earth this day this time it's been made no man that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be I to me brother and when he preached Christ the Mr gar revealed he said he had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve and he was going to do it and they're sitting here he said it if you if you fail to see it here he said come back to this message which was a threefold mystery of the Bride of Jesus Christ say well that was great okay before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no Savior and I'll fix and say a moment ago when he when he said that he turned and turned he went to Colossians 1. the whole message brother Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I even I I even I am the Lord and besides me there is no savior I have declared and have saved and have shown there was no strange God among you therefore ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord that I am God I hope it's getting over I mean I got I've I've agonized with this yet before yay before the day was I am I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand I will work and who shall let it thus saith the Lord your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel for your sake I have sent to Babylon and brought down all their nobles in the Chaldeans whose cries in their ships this is the World Church everything every obstacle that has come against you he has promised you that he would take care of it and put it down and he's right here in the scripture telling you he'll do it all you got to do is just come in and get into this word and he'll show you right I am the Lord the Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saith the Lord which maketh the way in the sea and a path in the mighty Waters he's telling you how great he is and all that he can do it can do and has done and will do which bringeth forth to Chariot and horse and Army and the power that shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as two amen I was thinking here uh I was reading here where brother Brandon says in the countdown page 19 paragraph 96 he said and any man that ever lives for God will have to go beyond these five senses right and we keep looking that we're going Beyond these five senses but I'm saying that's what when you take God's word and you say with his straps I'm Healed you just went beyond your senses a lot of people appreciate this but maybe we will he says once you I was talking to Peggy about it today he said once you come to the front to the altar to be prayed for for a certain thing he said don't you come back for that tomorrow he said don't he said don't never come back now if it's a back I mean it's using if it's a back problem well when God heals you from that back you don't come back until he's manifested but if you get another back ache you come back again do you understand but he I mean he plainly said that so okay where am I at okay I wanna I wanna in case if we don't believe that we can do this and I'm stuttering around here a little bit tonight I I just I apologize for that I just uh I've had a couple of days it's been really been kind of hard not being able to sleep and that I'm not trying to justify myself I'm just saying it sometimes Satan knows you what you're trying to bring and he'll wear you out and uh but uh I just got through reading about it reading about the Holy One of Israel and the the the one that said that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you see I mean I I just got through reading about the one that is my shepherd that is my savior that is my redeemer that is my all in all he is Hebrew 13 8. uh I I just uh I mentioned this last time I was up here and I I really feel like that people might not think that they can do or say I I was thinking there in a country code in Dr book 145 there he said give me a church full of Holy Spirit Holy Ghost I got to do in a year what theologians failed to do in 2000 years he said when the last Gentile is is a is brought in God he said God he said God anointed church then but but this is the thing that I want to tell you I believe that a church before that happens I believe that God is going to so anoint so brain a body a church a group of people that's predestinated to this position that they going to stop the effects of Satan on you see when when the last Gentile comes in you know that it's over it's over see but something has to bring us to the place where the last Gentile is in is going to stop his effects on us he will bang us he will come against us right after the change but he is not going to have any effects on us do you believe that well why don't we start doing it why don't we start acting like it I mean all of us uh I'm gonna go to uh I really I think I'll read more than uh than just a 18th chapter of Genesis I mean I'm going to read the 18th chapter but I want to uh read just a little just a little bit of because he said in here he told Abraham three times that him and savior we're going to have a child let's have a son yeah and he walked for 25 years so listen he walked for 25 years it was a journey that he took just like you and I are taking a journey there's things just shedding off of us every day every day they say God is taking everything and adding yourself that's what this statue of perfect man is he's taken 11 the unleavened bread out of you and put his own lavender inside you where you won't take nobody else's word I don't care what devil is coming against you you will not take what he says you say with your stripes Lord Jesus I'm Healed okay now I'm going to start right here and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he said in the tent doors of first verses 18 chapter the heat of the day now this has been spoke of spoken of many many many times by many many people but it has to become real to you God himself in human flesh appeared unto Abraham now God in human flesh can appear again right here in this Pulpit right in front of you and I he said when Jesus come here the word of he was the word of God in flesh and then when he comes inside of you he becomes the word in your flesh your flesh not just your soul but see that's what he that's what listen in the mind the Mind people don't think much of the mind but without the mind the body don't work but faith comes by hearing how many times have we heard faith comes by hearing and that by the word when you hear the word it comes to your mind you either reject it or receive it right there and if you receive it it comes down through those memory reason affection and so forth imagination and comes inside your soul God turns right around there right he gives you a revelation and brings it right back up through them same senses stamps your brain this is the truth what I just read to you and it brings it through your see tasteful smelling here he does that I like to lost my glasses again amen I'll tell you it's it's a it's a simple thing it's just like a uh uh well it's simple when it's revealed right and it's not simple until it's revealed there's people and listen how how blessed we are there's people that don't see nothing what you see right listen the two Cadillacs just think about this the two Cadillacs people sees them to Cadillacs and rising of the sun they can't see them sitting there they ain't sitting there they're moving they're moving through this building right now God got his his Holy Spirit In His Cadillac in the baptismal Holy Ghost since you are he's moving he's not just sitting there and Satan ain't either okay he's rolling This World In His Cadillac that's so close that it would deceive the elected so we've got these things that we've got to know and what to look for to be able to withstand it do you want it to surprise you I tell you that to me that's a great thing to know right right because he said that God's given time now that Cadillac is going up and the other one's going down but they look just alike okay and he lifted up his eyes and looked in low three minutes stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground I want you to listen closely and said my Lord my Lord he recognized him my Lord if if now I have found favor in thy side past not away I pray thee from thy servant this was the Old Testament they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like we have today and he brought God on the scene and it listen your life can bring God on the scene to you and he can bring his brother he can bring him on the scene to you then talk to you face to face lift the ear God can do it and he does it I've seen him do it I've seen him raise the dead more than once I've seen I've seen God all manner of healings I've had that well I won't some you know brother said a dream interpreted as a vision you know if you'll go to Daniel 9 24 well I was talking about a while ago and the Lord is my shepherd there in Psalms 23 1-6 and when you see him right there you see you see Daniel 9 24. can you see that can you see the son of man in that right there the shepherd they're able one Shepherd and when this here is manifested and he says you are my witnesses that this is so and this is me and the and I've done it I've done it so he said we ain't got faith for divine needle let alone Rapture in faith he said that something will have to come they'll they'll give us such factions and sweep us up out in Earth and it's here to do that it's not something that I'm looking to come right I'm not I've told my wife I told I tell him I said Lord I'm gonna walk with you if I have to walk by myself I don't believe you I'm gonna have to walk by myself but if I have to walk by myself I'm going to walk with you as long as you show me Lord It's You right now I want you to look look at it how many times have we said here in this congregation and listened to the life of Abraham brought on the scene do you realize I've got it in my notes Here he's talking about Mary had a virgin womb natural and spiritual had a virgin womb virgin and he says and so will we will be a virgin he and he said that in churches book he's either true seed God who presented Christ with a word of brow virgin right with that spot or would I wrinkle right he said she'd have the saith the Lord and nothing she didn't know what she'd have God's word and know what God wanted done with it and do it right and he lifted up his eyes and looked and little three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the 10 door and bowed himself toward it and says my Lord now if I have found favor and that's how I passed out of the way I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you you record where Paul got that record where Paul got that he saw another little man do that one time in the upper room a little water I pray you be fished and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fish you more so bread and comfort you your hearts after that ye have passed on after that you shall pass on for therefore or you come to your service and they said so so do as thou has said can we can you see it can we can you see it in the scriptures can you see the Lord sitting there in the upper room with his disciples doing the same thing he's the same yesterday today and forever and Abraham hastened it to the tent to Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal need it and make cakes upon the Earth just for cases sanctification baptism Holy Ghost produces the word of God in you that brings you to fruitation brings you to where you can trust God and you believe God regardless of what is going on if he is if he take if you have to leave this Earth You Can't Lose and I believe this is the time then and I pray and will the people you know he said he did say in every congregation they Believers make believe it's an unbelievers it always would be does that not make you desperate it makes me desperate Matthew 24 24 and I a couple of scripture scriptures up there he says that the Lord they'll say he's in the desert he's in the secret Chambers but don't you go there she signified to me that somebody's going to know not to travel that uh River Jordan still all they call them false doctors that God gave us Grace to set here we got to weak and hear a brother bring it down see God right listen God deal with me on something oh somebody in his church I don't even call his name because I mean you all probably Gonna Know It Anyway but you tell with me it's about something he placed him see see you need to be yes you got to be but say surely if I see a brother doing what God said he would be doing he's placing him sure God we need to see these things and Abraham ran into the herd and fishing cave tender and good and gave it and to the young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk in the cave which he had dressed and it types to me that we go eat and drink again listen they ate and it just out and it didn't have to use the bathroom so it tells me one day that I'm going to be in a place that if I eat something that I really gotta like it's going to be consumed there ain't gonna be no strain into it right and Abraham ran up to the herd fish and he took butter and milk and said it before him and he stood by them under the chin and they did eat and they said unto him were and listen how he said that and they said unto him horror is savior thy wife say you don't you don't listen to those little words when he said and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return here listen and he said God said almighty God said the same one that said that he is your Shepherd you don't need to want nothing but him and he supplies every need that you have all right he'll Lead You by The Still Waters and Green Pastures and though you walk through the Shadows of the Valley of Death it will harm you how can it harm you you know the best he could do with the worst he could do it put you in the glory of God and think about that when this is finished in you and I when we have a complete revelation of Jesus Christ God almighty Colossians 1. Genesis 1 26 27 had waited been on so long that's who you're looking at because you've got to weed out these other gods I don't mean just in this Bible I'm talking about in your life yeah exactly right well if it's if it's if it's right it's right for me and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life hello Sarah thou why shall have a son now he couldn't kill Sara he couldn't kill her because he'd give it he just got through saying that she was going to have a son now he told you that if you would all if what you would do if you would repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for admission your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and in the gift of the Holy Spirit you have you received the king Peter thinks that the Kings is water baptism is part of it but the keys is Jesus Christ amen amen there is what opens the door to the Keys open the door too but it don't stop there right he gives us but a Bobby gives us a complete revelation of Almighty all my actor where he put your name on his land book of life before the foundation of the world you see that you were his attribute that could nothing be added to or nothing took away how God could absolutely make a group of people here and a group of people here knowing everything they would do and he would not make you receive him he would not make either one of you do one thing but God you did it of your own free more agency your own choice and someday you go see that if you're going to change the Bible without dying you're going to see it you made the choice nobody made the choice you made the choice God presented a choice he presented it we're living our predestination okay now I didn't bring no watch but I don't think I'm gonna be here long anyway and Abraham and savior were old and well-stricken in age and if it cease to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah life in herself within our sea of sin after I am wax oh I have pleasure my Lord also being old being old also and the Lord said unto Hebron this is everything that I'm saying I'm putting on this right here well there's one scripture and the Lord said they said okay where am I after and say her life with her and see if I'm a waxhold and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah life saying shall I of a surety bear a child which am old she doubted God she I mean she looked right there she I mean she was right there she hurt she seemed to wounded Abraham's see now I'm not down I'm not a bad math and Savor I'm saying that we aren't very careful we'll fall in the same category that Sarah did and if we doubt God or one eye holder we going by the ground the best we're going by the ground and we don't believe that God can bring us to a position like I was talking about a while ago give me a church full of the Holy Ghost see we had a church full of the Holy Ghost once it's 120 in upper room right he said give me one and he gives us time he give us type 30 no brother was talking about life in Ephesians I mean Israel always Through the Bible we go walk all the way through the Bible and God's showing us these things and God will bring us together he because he has foreigned us as with one another we're the the church that Jesus Christ is coming for is one with him and each other in him we're supposed to be coming together not magnetized apart or knocked apart by like turtle electricity there's a five-fold mission in this world and each one of them has got their part to Ministry and if if I listen if we reject either one of them in their message it could be speaking of our predestination you ever thought about that and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore disarray life saying shall I have a surety Bear Child which him old is anything too hard for the Lord now this is this is my scripture right here is anything too hard for the Lord right and listen I said is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto the unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son right then and he almost said he said then Sarah denied saying I laugh not but she for she was afraid and he said me but I did a Slave she thought lightly she just didn't believe it and then is this church I'm talking about the two Cadillacs again do do we just hope that we're of this Cadillac is on the right is that is that what we have is this a hope now if it's the hope of Hebrews 11 faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen if we got the faith we it must have the substance which is God and then if we got the substance of God in the faith of God we can count on him for anything but when you ask God for something you have to stand there on it until he comes to it because he's the only manifester of the word and I'm going to tell you something else old age ain't got nothing to do with the rapture yes sir I mean listen I know that I ain't 20 years old no more but I know God is eternal the one that's inside of me and you brought Sam is eternal that's the interstate 126. and he's began to separate himself in Genesis 2 7 right multiply himself and he still multiply as far as I know but you know I'm going to test him as it was in the days of Noah so sad to being a covenant son of man and how many of us can can also say that we don't say it's a Sodom and condition in the world today he said he said except the Lord shortened the days no flesh wouldn't be saved can we see that okay okay this is this is something bro Sam just mentioned here the other day and I I preach on it for quite some time it's a in the season out there with a shook now do and I'm gonna ask you do you understand what they are now I've got in trouble asking people Christians I've got that trouble well they're they'll say something to me and I said well what do you think about so-and-so they shed it up I just clamp and never say another word to me never I've had them for years go years not saying nothing it just shut me off and what if I was telling the truth okay this is a seed not here with the shook there's there's the secret of the message now this is paragraph 152 or or it says 105.2 I don't know which one it is uh just exactly the father's business now there is a secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is a father's business could you think of what the father's business was to him to fulfill what Isaiah said now think think on Hezekiah Hezekiah and I I mentioned this on several I didn't really get down on it like I really wanted to but he he was he pleased God I mean he done the things of God had parents of God he he'd done all the things he done with God and then when it comes to time for him to die God because God knows all things he sent Isaiah there and he turned he turned his face to the wall and began to pray and say God you you know that I've done this I've done this and he didn't say he didn't do it right but see God Knows Best so when we pray we all say not my will Lord thine will be done because I wouldn't if I'd been I as a kind I wouldn't want to stay here and done the things that he done right right would you now listen when the wisest mens in the world besides Jesus Christ was a Solomon would you wanted to do would you really wanted his job think about it I mean just think about it look what Solomon did in the latter part of his life we don't want to wind up this way that's why I'm preaching like I'm preaching and that's why these brothers is doing the same thing I like with brother Bob I see him brother Bob up here that pouring his heart out he's he's an emotional brother and and yeah you wouldn't believe I am would you but I am I really am but I'll tell you what I mean I I love to see a person I I've seen in every one of you Brothers I mean and I've seen it and me and Danny was talking here the other day and God what a blessed God I mean that he even brought him into my life and and I could say each one of you what what a what a what mercy and Grace God has given me is his precious bark I mean you I I can't tell you how much I love and how much I pray for you you're in the constantly before my face now there's a secret of the message now he fixing to bring the secret of the message if you'll go to the 13th chapter of Matthew and read schofield's notes you'll see the the Mysteries there that brother Branham took them and wrote them down and put them in surgeons it's the time but he preached on them by Revelation Schofield put him down and had a great understanding of it but we have been blessed to have a prophet of God the prophet of God for our day see so that there's there's more is given more as he expected there's a there's a cigarette of the mission and just as actually father's business what is the Father's could you think of what the father's business was to him a virgin shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said the lame shall leap like a heart and I'll and and look at these things and uh just let me stay with you and all these things that take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you like unto me even the father's business to fulfill that word for his day so we gotta we got a word to fulfill for our day God to believe God over what Sarah did right and again I say I'm not down in Sarah say that's what Sarah saw why and I said the last time I was speaking I said you know she only live what was 37 years after the change she was well old enough young enough to have all them children Abraham had with another woman now I don't know that but but I certainly think about it so there's things that we can we can do we must stand correction according to Hebrews 12. for every son that comes to God must be chasten to God tested tide and proven corrected and if we don't do that it's proven Who We Are if that comes down through them stalks of them Natural Women what about these stalks are these Spiritual Church women Church means women women means churches rather is that right then what is it now we must be about the father's business if we would cry back the grain yes sir what what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 do we as each individual sit here do we know what the message of Malachi 4 is do we know I'm asking you now you ain't going to say a word but if you don't you better get busy because this is a requirement we're to Vindicated Malachi 4. now you go uh three what 336 he says that this is this is this is I got it in my notes here he said it's actually a a a a special class of people that's uh that how do you say that uh special designation of himself the church you know he makes a church a president a present destination if he said if I got the words right but it's him he absolutely comes on the scene because we fulfill the son of man Ministry in Luke 17 30 tells us here it says Luke 17 30. vindicate Hebrews 13 8. see if you if you'll get it all together you're right there in Hebrews 13 8. if you'll get it all together you'll be able to go over here all the way to where he'd be scared to come to sin down and see who he is and what he is and how he is and what are you doing and how he's doing it and why you've done it for right and don't say I can't see that don't do that don't do that you can see it now now like Brazil said he says we're not on the same level but I'll tell you what when the headship comes there's a headship just uh uh just anoint uh the uh the ministry all right in the upper room there they were 120 and a lot of them was women do you believe that they was all in the faith of the fathers they was and but they had their special jobs all of them didn't preach but all of them lived there are the Christ the son of the Living God John 14 12. then vindicate all of his words Hebrew vindicate Hebrews Revelation to 10th chapter now now there's a mighty angel that comes down descends in a cloud we've seen that I was alive anyway I didn't see it but I know it happened because if God gave me a revelation February 28 1963 he descended like he ascended up right now my brother was a prophet of God was told to go back to Jeffersonville right he preached him seals he did so that's how long he's been Church he's given us plenty of time he says now if he's here I'll be leaving you for good right two of us can't be here at the same time before you see so uh where are we say it what do we know what we don't know now if we don't know we ought to be desperate I'll tell you one thing I've had this brother right here preach a many a Time and I said I challenge her whoa I mean I'm telling you truth and God was blessing me God I'm going to tell you what God turned with me one time I will say this part me and my wife was it was had gone to bed and and obviously I always sometimes I stay a week two hour two three whatever it was talking to God and he showed me he said I'm going to send you under set you under a Ministry that's going to bring you out of Egypt now as far as I go with it but see only God he said I'm gonna send you and I'm gonna go with you and I'm gonna make sure that you're there and I'm gonna make sure that he preaches it it happened right does anybody ever speak to you that way do you do you tonight right here in this congregation has God spoke to you and told you he's bringing you all I've read scriptures I've been reading it all over amen you know you're just coming to church right it ain't just preaching the same old thing because a lot of times we think so but it takes a lot of doing right right to get it done Revelation 10th chapter the opening the Seven Seals and all and all the Mysteries even the serpent seed and all would be manifested marriage and divorce you know I've got wrote all over my books all up through the years I said the true revelation of marriage divorce to take you into rapture the absolute truth of Revelation I mean uh Romans 7 and the message Imagine The Voice invisible Union it'll bring you right on out to the other end amen amen see but if you ain't no desperation you ain't gonna get to because real Brown said no desperation you perish without desperation you perish and and if we get to thought that we can't do it we made a serious seriously we're telling God he can't do something okay let me just go here marriage and divorce and all these other Mysteries that's been hid under the pillars from all these years from the theologians and so forth but it's now the hour that's the father's business I think they would receive it they want to be dignified say our denomination don't teach us that or let me say this way let me say it put it this way we'll say well big boy speak for yourself and what if that big boy was speaking for God right right and I believe he was but the Bible does that's right God vindicates it to be the true and he did that amen amen you're the way he did that I was sitting there I was standing there I was there and and when once somebody gets off the word if they will not straighten up according to Hebrews 12 they gonna get further and further and further and further until they don't even look like the same person thank you fulfill this age when the Seven Seals are just proven the denominations has just been carriers how many times has my brother brought down that's another one of the father's businesses the father's business now is to show you them denomination is not his Glory now I just gotta I just got through Reading Isaiah 43 and we can go on and go chapter on chapter on chapter on chapter on chapter right over to the says if you add anything to this word this book or takes anything away the plagues of this book will be added to you your name be took out the book of life we can do that and somebody somebody gonna stand here more elegant with me amen and they're going to lay this down there and we're going to come back because I've never heard my pastor say one time in all the many many many many years that I've been here that he couldn't learn something new from God and and unfortunately a lot of us think we we got it their man-made systems that deny the words now we can be as man-made as any denomination across the street or up to a country or wherever we have got to come to the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ this here Plus those Thunders because if the first Thunder under the first seal a lamb stood there with a book in his hand and said there goes a white horse rider see there it's another person right well let me finish this part here up I'm almost I I I I won't even a virgin shall conceive she conceived that was a father's business now this is sardisian church age uh page 265. you know we are living in the end time it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they are now I've saved all this for last that's why I was stumbling so much I wanted to get to this but but I I had I tried my best to lay that to lay something down because you've got to see that you can do it you got to see that you're part of him you got to see that he put your name on the lounge Book of Life if you don't see it How You Gonna Know It God wants somebody that he can Fellowship like he did with Abraham he wanted to favor a fellowship with Sarah but Sarah had left she didn't laugh but she doubted if we ain't careful we'll do the same thing okay let me see now you know where I live at the end time is this age the churches are going to come together and as they are even now control the world politics they will soon control the finances of the world what's going on are we blind that we can't see if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sale he says bride here twice you will lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system churches Church order will be physically bereth now how are you going to know if you don't know him right right there will be a presented to them a great temptation to give in preaching will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system listen this ain't going to be it's like in Deuteronomy 13 there or or First Kings 13. see Deuteronomy said if a if a preacher if a dreamer or a prophet tells you something that's going to come to True come to pass and it comes to pass and takes you to another God now listen this ain't taking you to Buddhism we're over here in Asia we're living now see us in that River Jordan ain't taking me nowhere he said it's going to get much closer than that brother dick I mean you can absolutely organize your own own person right right and the best you can hope for right is go by the ground and I don't believe I believe every one of us and I with all my heart I pray this little group and I know Brother Sam and waiting and Bob and Eric it feels the same way they will give in to flatterers and banishments of the hierarchy that people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter whoa a shepherd false Shepherd it ain't like Balaam his own his son went so far past Balaam and Jezebel he's so close to able to see the elected and he was so close that if he don't shorten the days ain't no flesh gonna be saved right now what else what kind of people ought that to make us brother what should that do to us should he bring Godly sincere desperation should it should we begin to spend more time with God instead of ever think in the world this I know people has to work but I listened Sam knows it's true I was out there with him I was all over him and I always had them books in my back pocket in my cover offs people kind of made lie to it yeah you see him you see goddamn books in his pocket I did I didn't ever forget I read who is this male shed deck one night on third shift the whole book one night so when you talk about all that reading praise God brother I'm so glad you did yeah because it struck her it struck something in me but the Judgment but in the Judgment they will found Nay be found naked they would not be given those white robes neither will they walk in them you can't walk in the spotted garment at the world holding hands with the devil lay here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up and hear the voice of God cry and come out of her organize religion this ain't the Baptist prison they dinner and doorknobs this ain't the Pentecostal church this is the people that says they followed this man this is that other Cadillac it's riding so close to us exactly exactly that you'd be no partaker ever since unless you received none of her that you receive her plagues God is speaking shunning religions of this world like you shouldn't it plague if you don't know them how can you shun bam leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance in the blood of the lamb and do it now for tomorrow may be too late they say I got a road down here this is another creation of Liberty he said but now he is standing in the midst of his church right here he's right here Revelation 1 it's right here Revelation I mean to Genesis 1 26 Revelation is right here right in the midst of his church right now who is this church I didn't mean to get blisters but I tell you you see you look and you and you you can talk to people you can talk to people and by the grace if God has brought you somewhere bro Wade you can talk to people and know where they at right here that don't make you no judge but if you walk through somewhere and you see somebody else in the same place what you're going to do is you're going to try to help them you don't you don't slam them like you used to I mean wait don't I I remember with white boy he was like somebody else I Used to Know but he's he you gain wisdom the more Revelation you get is the more wisdom that you get there ain't no big eyes in little use 172. notice the harmony of the father and the son see this is this is what I'm saying uh in Psalms 23. this is where I started from I brought it back to Daniel 9 24. see we I believe with all my heart that we finished the book we finished the book here he was here's Daniel 9 24. that's the I could only be Jesus Christ the son of man he come into this world he did his job and he he did everything that he was supposed to do knowing at all was going to happen and he would have he left something for us to do we come through the ages he said he we talked about uh uh trumpet with Sam he said a sword open a message would come forth a mystery he said he did it be a group of people that would receive it and be sealed away there'd be a group of people that rejected in their silhouette and a plague would fall on them it's still going on Church he said a gospel Trump the Lord himself she had a sin with a child divorce all gain that Trump of God God a gospel trumpet well had he descended to you and me and he justified us he Sanctified us he filled us with his spirit he's led us brother and besides it still waters oh God he listen nothing can harm us right if this body goes down right back up for sale he get his name fear and we have to stop fearing him faith is not made perfect and fear sister Gail it's not we have to quit fearing him brother Bradley he said boo you know he kind of he's a boo back he got boo-boo and he just got his what nothing all right so well that was brother Brown well in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound all the Mysteries that had been told by the prophets that would be revealed and we received the sounding of the voice and the revelation of the mistress that's what we do that's what we're called to Sister yeah bro tomorrow we're called to we're called and if God promised it and he called us to it this is the age of the time for it we can do it but we'll leave here and a lot of time and and we go out wondering what did that brother mean listen let me finish this up I think they will receive it they don't want to be deep they don't want it they're too dignified fulfilling this age when the seven centers are just proving the denominations had just been carriers let me see where I'm at now I know I'd have lost everything over there uh okay he says he didn't win this message and uh and I was thinking about the countdown he says you can have the Holy Spirit every hour you live die and miss it and go to hell try that one on Church right now he said that's what he told that's what he he preached to the people he said you can have the Holy Ghost every hour that you live the Holy Spirit he even said her he said now being born again and the new birth is different explaining that one to him but by the grace of God he's got it in his place he explained it but we don't read we don't listen that's why I still like to read Because I make notes I can't hardly make notes off a computer for me you know because let people a lot smaller than I am I said uh uh paragraph 189 I got 102. I don't know what type two words are what is it you've got to get with the word to get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of his friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we want to lie we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to feel every fiber of his church now this if it's anything I could say to you this is what I say I said everything I've said that God wants to feel every fiber this is the this is the plan this is what he was going to achieve that he had in his mind before there was ever World barrier brother he said in Christ the minister God filled a bride we are we're part of the mystery and must be revealed thank you Lord but we just received it just enough to get a sort of place we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking let's see now he said feel f i l l feel he wants to be in control of your thinking he wants to fill your mind what did I say while ago I said faith comes by here and you hear the word by anointed person of anointing minister of God and it could be the one sitting next to you that gives you something that he's heard him say it that God will revealed it to you because it travels through the body the word travels through the body he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself out to your thinking just so Serenity in God till his word just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life my words are alive said Jesus he's placed them teachers believe in the Bible prophecy say the truth that say this show the same prophecy that they always did down through the age what's he done he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word his word the kingdom of God and God's word made Power Hebrew 13 8. he's the same yesterday today and forever listen we're all falling apart uh this is the number two book uh 11 27. it's almost it may be almost past fitting time now this this uh could it be there was a time that God told Noah you preached long enough now You Preach You Preach for 120 years you're my faithful servant Rodeo for his faithful servant all of you he said now I want you to go into art I'm going to close the door it was seven days nothing happened that was showing on our side and then North Third pool began to speak that he is he says you'd either do this or God's going to open up the skies you're gonna die and I'm saying right here now in this little group of people surely I mean in my heart surely Lord there's nobody here that don't love you surely there's nobody here that don't want more of a more of a relationship with you Lord that you that wants such a relationship with you that God that you could they could be sitting there and it's sitting there and they're reaching catch you by the hand he said I do it many many times that that angel of God is encountered about those who fear and love the Lord then I can touch him I can believe him I I don't I don't want to believe me I believe me too much and it's cost me too much trouble I want to believe God I got to watch by laying these glasses down okay okay let me finish this it may be almost past feeling time see because there will come a time like that when the spirit of God will will be with taken from the Earth there will be no more now listen close church the church will remain a while that's right preaching because it has to preach to the eternally lost that's going on now he now listen to he says just as every Ministry did coming down through the age the last part of every Ministry preached to the Eternal loss and they will be a minister now they will preached to the Eternal loss after they have refused to receive it I'm finishing up Church I want you to I want to I want to say this to you when uh Moses went over uh when when Israel got desperate enough they're in in Egypt and they must have really got desperate because God come down to Moses you know in the burning bush he said I've heard the Cry of my people that's right that's right I'm going to deliver Moses and I'm going to send you now now that God has done the same thing in Ephesians 4. he said I've heard the Cry of my people now I've sent my prophet I've seen him now from here I'm going to sit in the church Apostles prophets of his passion and teachers because I want him prepared and this is the only way they can be prepared are you we Witnesses of this right now where they was coming out you know all that they've done they they they they Aaron made the the uh the golden calf and he he he told if you know the scriptures I'm telling you the truth boy you he says he just jumped out to fire I mean it's amazing I mean this was somebody that God said you be you be the prophet and God Moses be God to you you know so but you you know all these things that happen but what he done he is he told Moses he says I'm sending you you go get my people and bring them to this mountain right now this I'm official with this you you bring them to dismountable now by the time they got to that mountain do you know the condition they was in yeah and the fear that they had of God listen if they had a walk before God like God wanted him to walk before him they wouldn't have had that fear they would have had the love of God and when when they the the mountain was was was thundered and quaking I mean that can you imagine a person that's lost she's looking I said don't let God speak we'll die unless we die let Moses speak there was a lick of Fire if they had to come correctly there was a lick of fire for every one of them right there fear would have been goals it's the truth they wouldn't have no fear except displeasing God now I'm saying here here we are 120 that all that was there was filled with the holy spirit with that liquor fire he's come down to us now to fulfill this thing to make manifests the word of God are we up for the task he said and all the people saw the thunderings enlightenments and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood a far off and they said unto Moses speak thou for with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not see he he was there he was I mean God had him standing there fear enough for God has come to prove you and and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin not and the people stood afar off and Moses Drew near to the thick Darkness where God was and the Lord said unto Moses now because God accepted I mean accepted Moses and the Lord said unto Moses thus thy shall say unto the children of Israel ye have seen that I have talked with you from Heaven you shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall you make unto you gods of gold and of course he goes on and on and on I mean it's it's just so much uh that but uh that brother uh Joseph did you uh did you happen to get these these two uh tongues and interpretations uh that I had on the Blasphemous names and uh uh the way back if he didn't I'm gonna read him are they up there okay that's it I want you to listen there's a story here about this many years ago Pig and I would listen to uh I just about wore out last famous names I did statute perfect man and at the back of it at the back of the message it had a a a a person speaking with tongues and a person interpreted now I've got it here so I took it off I told Peggy I said Peggy let's let's get this off I said we may need this someday so we we burned down and we got it and I got it right here excuse me I'll read it I want you to and I understand I'm gonna close when I do this so when I got him when we got it off I mean just got it off I said I I think what we need to do is get another tape on this right here in case something happens is tape well somehow I don't know what happened to tell you but never has I that never have I felt one since they took it off listen to me tell you something they took it off and it this one

unto this book or you take away what he's here's what happened and I say about the prophet's message if God used somebody through the gift to bring to tugs and interpretation and somebody was so brave that they could take it off that God come to on the scene and and Vindicated what had been preached by this and somebody took it off and it ain't on there no more now if brother Joe I hope Brother

confession and repentance of the things you have done go my son dedicated to me this day your spiritual mind in your body that you might be a chosen vessel elected and called out from among them
