appreciate everything that everybody did for the for the Ohio group this past weekend and we had a good times good seeing them and having fellowship with them and they did a good job and they're singing testimonies and God's doing a work um in their on their end and so we just thank God for what he's doing over there amen praise the Lord I also want to thank you all for your prayers for us as we were traveling back and forth with brother Eric uh the several weeks ago and uh um he really enjoyed his time his himself here him and his family and um and you all helped make that possible for him as well but ever since that ever since he was a little kid he wanted was one of his dreams to be able to go to Jefferson Ville Indiana and thank God we were able to be part of that so that was he he he he literally said that he he was laying next to his wife in the bed there at the hotel where we were staying at in Louisville Kentucky and he said he told her he said I can't believe this is actually happening now you see to them it's like it's a big thing you know but for us it's just a common old Jeffersonville you know where God did such great wonderful things that but yet we forget about it but for them they keep that down there alive they keep it because they've never seen it but you and I that have seen it we just say oh it's just common you know it's unfortunate you know it's unfortunate I wish we we would keep and and you know that happens to me too I'm not saying it's just you all this happens to me it just get we get we come to church and everything just seems common but you know when you haven't experienced it amen and and you haven't really you know seen it you know for yourself you know it's something new it's something fresh so y'all just pray for them and uh pray for brother Eric continue help him in his ministry down there amen that there is a lot of work to do down there so y'all just remember them in prayer let's turn to Judges chapter 6 uh let's let's and we're going to start at verse one we're going to talk a little bit about Gideon this this evening and I want to titled is God's calling you out of your comfort zone how many believe that God is doing that in this hour the closer we get to the coming of the Lord the easier things are not going to get that's right let me say that again the closer we get to the coming of the Lord the harder things are going to get and just expect it but God is trying to do something in our lives whether it's through sickness whether it's through family issues or whether it's through financial issues the economy the the the the gas prices Whatever It Is God is squeezing the best out of you because he knows it's in there if you've got the Holy Ghost so so so he will send whatever he's he he will in order to squeeze what he knows your potentials are amen praise the Lord so let's just bow our heads before we read our heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus once again for the opportunity that we have to open back the page pages of your word we realize Lord that we're insufficient within ourselves father and we just ask that you'd have your way this evening Lord speak through my lips Lord and and and help us Lord to receive something from you encourage us father and Lord help us father to just move forward Lord God and no matter what the obstacles may come Lord God lord we are we are people that are focused father focused on you Lord Jesus focused on your word focus on the end goal Lord Jesus and we just pray that you'd help us all bless each and everyone here meet every need amongst us Lord God even as the word Goes Forth heal those sick bodies Lord father meet whatever the need is father as the word is going forth and I just commit myself into your hands now father in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen uh Judges chapter 1 or chapter 6 I'm sorry here's here and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand hand of Midian 7even years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of of the East even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the in increase of the earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass can you imagine that the children of Israel were there planting and living out their Liv daily lives and because they got so comfortable with their daily living amen they started worshiping Idols let me let me dab in let me dab with this in my life let me let's do this and it come something else became their God and so God said I'm not going to share my glory with anybody else so he allowed the midianites to come in and take everything that they had to a point where they were building caves in order to hide from them for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number this the amount of the uh uh uh median ites and they enter Ed into the land to destroy it I wonder if that isn't what's happening in in the in the US today and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and that's where God wants want wanted them to be and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus say the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage let's let's skip down to verse number 11 and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in oah and P and pertained unto joash the abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites Gideon was in his comfort zone that's all he needed to do he was in his comfort zone just like many of us we're just in our comfort zone as long as I know if I just keep doing this I'm protected just keep doing this but see God had something planned for him amen and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor amen with that you may be seated praise God you know I I I often think about this scripture how here's Gideon and you have to remember the setting of this of of of this story is that the children of Israel were already in the promised land think about that the children of Israel were already in their promised land this was after after Joshua this was after and so it was the time of the judges where they didn't have a king that was ruling uh uh uh that was ruling over them and so Gideon of course became one ended up being one of the judges that um that helped save Israel and you can read about it for the next two or three chapters but here's Gideon Gideon is presented to us here at this moment and where and what is Gideon doing he is hiding from the midianites he is hiding from from what uh because he's afraid as well he got to a point where he was just like everybody else amen whatever they were doing whatever we're just hiding we're trying to just uh because and not understanding the reason why he they got to the point where they got because later on we we we see here um if if you read in verse 13 it says and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befalling us I wonder if that's what we don't ask ourselves when things are not going right in our lives what is it that's happening in our home or is not happening in our home what is it that's happening in your life spiritually or not happening in your life spiritually and then when things start coming falling apart Lord why is this happening to us it's the same thing that Gideon was asking but the Lord At the beginning told told us clearly that the children of Israel had done evil in the sight of the Lord they were started worshiping other gods in other words putting other gods before them maybe it was an individual or a man or or or or or Idols or whatever it was maybe it was their businesses maybe it was money maybe it was their their education whatever it was something was an idol for in in their in their life and God said I will not share my glory with with any other Idol amen God is not going to share his glory with anything amen that you put before him you either serve God or you don't right am man just like Joshua stood up he said he said uh you're either serve the Lord or or but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord amen praise God and so and so Gideon is here and he's saiding oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt so all he knew was everything that they had to the message that they had been told of what God did back then amen but you see you realized and we see it no matter how much you know the message or how many people have come into the message or know the word amen people backslide you you can have known this message 50 70 even met the prophet shook his hand that doesn't stop you from backsliding and and and and forsaking and forsaking the Lord but you remember the Lord never forsook you and you'll find them again where you left them amen it doesn't guarantee amen that that you had that you have to continually it's not just about one experience with God it's a continuous experience with God Amen amen and that's that's a that's a responsibility that's for you and I in this hour when the going gets tough amen you got to get tougher amen things are pressure is going to come on us life is going to happen but is that the time to quit and leave and stop going to church and and and and leaving the word no that's actually the time for you to get stronger your family depends on it your your your children depend on it amen your your your friends co-workers people are looking at your life and they see you as an example but you're a quitter they can't gain strength from you they're not going to get strength from you and then you're booh whooing in the corner why do people don't talk to me or like me or have any confidence in me because you're a quitter spiritual quitter and that's what Gideon had become Gideon amen but see the Lord had seen something gide cu the Lord doesn't see the way we see things cuz this is how this is how the Lord appeared to him he said the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and there was Gideon hiding threshing threshing there right next to the Wi press I hope they don't see me over here and here comes this man that appears before him and he says Thou Gideon you are a man of Valor can you imagine that you being scared and then and then somebody comes before you and says you know what you're not a scared person you're not a scaredy cat and then that's when Gideon starts asking he's like well Lord but he didn't know that it was the Lord talking to him at that moment amen let's continue reading he said did not the Lord bring us from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and deliver delivered us into the hands of the medit of course forgetting the reason why as many of us do sometimes and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might now can you imagine you sitting there and you're and and you're doing what you're you know you're in your comfort zone you're doing your daily task don't every don't nobody get me out of my comfort zone I want to just do this and that's it right don't don't get me out of my comfort zone and and if you do people get upset when they get out of their comfort zone it's almost like when you sit in someone's seat at church look at their faces when they come in oh my I wonder if that's the get the face that Gideon had what is he talking about I'm a mighty man of Valor I'm strong man go in this thy might he said to go to do what I wonder if that's what if that's what Gideon Gideon is asking go to do what go in what Mike see that's what the thing is is that the Lord wants us to go and serve him Amen in what you have already you you don't need anything else you don't need amen go with what you have right now no but I got to wait until I get a better person and and I start going to church uh uh uh every single Sunday every single Wednesday no go with what you have now amen because with what you have now it will lead you Amen to go to church every Sunday and every Wednesday and and and read the word and study and meditate and pray and be the the the husband and the father and the mother and the and the wife that you're supposed to be go with what you have now the faith at what you have now God is capable to use that amen what did God tell Moses amen pick up that stick that you have in your hand and with that stick I'll do Miracles amen God wants to use your stick as I preached here a few months ago amen he wants to use what you have so he's telling Gideon he said go with thou go go in this thy might amen why because he's going to take care of the rest amen we do our part he'll do the rest amen amen praise the Lord and thou shalt save Israel what look what he's telling him Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee praise the Lord Jesus amen and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith All Shall I save Israel in other words with what am I going to save Israel with behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house so now he's making excuses just like Moses was was but you know what God loves it when when there's a person that doesn't really want to do what he wants to do what he wants him to do those are the ones he wants to use those are the ones that he's going to work miracles and wonders through amen the one that's that's clamoring to to to I'll just take a preacher as an example the one that's wanting to really just preach that's the one you need to be careful of am the one that really wants to get up and do something at church and just just re you be careful amen those are the ones that you have to be careful with because amen the person I don't I don't know who it's not it's preaching is not fun it's not the the the you know what the in in in in America the the most undervalued position in in America is a pastor according to to to the to the censuses and things that they've done is the most undervalued position or or I think I'm saying the right word or the the the most underappreciated is a pastor I don't know why anybody would even want want to be a pastor but if you're really God called amen you're going to be doing what God called you to do when you don't want to do it amen that's the one that God says all right that's what I want that's what I want because I know it won't be him amen dealing with the people it'll be me through him and he will allow me to deal with the people amen the way I want to do it you see God is all about getting the glory out of this amen that's what he's about he's not going to share his glory with anybody else amen and it's not about the man and it's not about about his glory we appreciate the man we appre appreciate what God has done amen but it's about God ultimately and he gets the glory praise the Lord Jesus amen I appreciate all the man you know that that I have I have sat under you know from the denominational Church from the Baptist Church that I was in even in the Jehovah's Witness even the Catholic church I appreciate the priests that that help that that that that helped me you know go through first communion and stick out my tongue to take the wafer and all of that it helped me with something with God you know I appreciate all of that but it was ultimately leading me to have a relationship with God Amen and not with the individual am amen it's ultimately about God praise the Lord and the and and so and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith All Shall I save Israel behold my family's porn manasse verse 16 and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the minites as one as one man now let's let's read this quote here brother Brown says because I I've always as I was looking at this I couldn't help to think you know of of that mother Eagle that brother brandom talks about where she makes that Nest very comfortable for her eaglets for her eggs that are going to be born she makes sure that that when she makes that Nest that it's going to be very comfortable for them so it doesn't hurt them when they're tender and they're and they're small you see and with that same beak that she feeds them they start growing right they start growing and they start getting to a point where now wait a second these these kids are going to have to fly just like me too how I to get them out of this place Place almost like some of parents when we start thinking when our kids are turning 18 19 20 21 now I'm not going to kick my kids out but I'm just saying you know sometimes we we sometimes we we we think that that's the best for them and that's fine and that might be the best thing for them right but you see at some point our children amen they're going to have to take up wings and fly that's right and that's what God Amen wants to do with us at some point we got to take up Wings spiritually and fly amen it's it's we've had enough you know that same beak that that that the Lord has been feeding us with amen that same beak now starts destroying and taking up that rabbit skin that squirrel skin all that stuff everything amen and becomes and then the the the the eaglet they're oh my goodness what's going on it's all prickly now it's not soft and plush we're not falling asleep like we used to they're they're not rocking us to sleep anymore you know now they're they're they're tearing our hides now with the preaching well then that's what we need sometimes we you're a hides to be T me included but you see those eaglets amen they they have to have a reason to to to get out of there right you got to have a reason Amen to get out of your comfort zone God's going to make sure that you get out of your comfort zone some way or another because we're just too comfortable with life we're just too comfortable you know my wife and me we were talking about the other night we were saying you know she was saying you know I'd like to maybe change the the the the the ceiling fan in our in our room you know it's getting a little older and stuff I start thinking about some of those bathrooms we've been in Honduras and stuff and in in Brothers and Sisters houses and she started thinking about the same thing it's like you know the ceiling fan is just fine it's just fine when you start thinking you start seeing the other side of things you won't think all those things are so important that's right that's and you'll start thinking about H better ways to spend your money you won't think that all that stuff is it's nice it's fine if you can do it that's wonderful but the ceiling fan is just fine it still works it still rotates still gives air it's just that we wanted you know some something that kind of matched the the rest of the decor but it's not a need it was only a want right right and so God Amen wants us to start uh you know wants loves to get his children out of their comfort zones amen now I'm not saying that God doesn't want you to have a nice ceiling fan in your house especially if those blades are like this it's time to get another ceiling fan right but in the hour that we're living in Saints what are we looking at are we looking up or we keep looking horizontally at everything around us and see what we can obtain in this world and what we get am man because none of that you're taking with you none of that that you're you're going to Ive I've never seen a U-Haul truck behind the hearse none of it you're taking with us only the things that you do for God Amen is what's going ahead that's right and what will be presented before him now brother Brandon would say it like this this is what he would say he says so you know what happens the old mother comes into that nest and she takes that same beak that that she doed it all up with and pulls every bit of that sheep skin out every bit of that rabbit fur out and throws the thing out of the nest oh it's it's she she and she does it it's it's doesn't it doesn't look pretty she does it uh in a rough way right right she makes the nest so miserable till they can't even sit down those little eaglets right I just wonder how comfortable we are you know in this l in the in leoa that we're living in when God has given us and he he's just tearing tearing all that fur out you know he's and we're still trying to just kind of put the fur back on right no I want it dur and you're stapling it together and everything I like my comfort Z I love my Comforts I love Leo DEA me included we love it brother you know God knows how to make you willing to do things brother brandham said God knows how to make you willing to do things that's happened to the many of you family certainly it is he just pulls all that soft pad out so you walk on Thorns my every time he sits down it's a it's it's on a thorn he jumps up he becomes discouraged after a while that that little eaglet and I think if there was ever time that the Pentecostal Church ought to be discouraged is now he continues to say we've denominated ourselves now he's talking to the Pentecostal Church in that day amen and to the denominations of that day but you see we sometimes we make our own denominations even in one church we make our own little clicks and our own little ideas and and then brother and sister don't see it that way I don't know if I'm going to go shake their hand or or even say hello we make our own ideas and we make our own judgments about people because maybe of somebody or some family member told you about them or or or or or something but you see that's our own little denominations within our own church but God is doing everything he can to pull all that out Saints it's time to go home it's time to go home for us to be Pitter pattering and and having feelings and stuff against each other it's not time for that it's time for us to actually draw closer to each other especially as the time of the as the is coming as soon at hand praise God we've denominated ourselves built great barriers of lines brother Brown continues to say one's assemblies the other one's a Oneness the other one is this I'm a brother Bob I'm I'm I'm a brother Aaron I'm a brother Wade I'm a brother Dale I'm a amen amen I'm of God praise the Lord and I'm I'm I'm with any brother that speaks the word of the Lord behind that pulpit amen well if brother so and so is not doing I don't think it's I don't think it's it it's too valid is it the word of the Lord coming out of his lips or is he up there just playing games praise God the other is this and that and the other one and and then we just built such lines and barriers Till There is a stick stick here and a stick stick there what's the matter God fixing to take us out of it he says amen praise the Lord that's exactly what it is them little old Eagles get tired setting down on them Thorns amen eventually they got to get up and fly and that's what God wants to do amen when we're in our comfort zones he wants us Amen to just fly for ourselves instead of just crying go and speak praise the Lord that's and that's what God was trying to do with Gideon amen he was in a rut he was in a in in a in a in a in his comfort zone and God knew that that he had that he had potential Amen to do something great for him and so he started calling directly telling calling the things that they were not as though they were telling him that he was mighty when he was not displaying that and that's how sometimes you know when we're dealing with our children you know I'm getting back to the parenting now when we're dealing with our children amen we so we can't deal with with our children amen the same way right you know some some some of some maybe one of our CH our child is is is is is a different way and needs to be talked to a different way you see you know or or or or or dealt with a certain way because you know that that's what's going to work you see but if you have a cookie cutter approach and you and and you're like why did this one go this way or why heyen maybe you didn't come to the heart of that child or dealt with that child in in his strength or in what he's you see what I'm trying to say but sometimes we have it as a cookie cutter but that's not how God dealt with Gideon God dealt with Gideon you know he could have he could have dealt with him the way he dealt with Moses at the burning bush but that's not how he appeared to Gideon he knew that that was not the way that was going to work and was going to get Gideon's reaction amen so he dealt with Gideon and telling him you know you're you're you're strong you know sometimes our our children amen when they're when they're like just falling flat on their face and they're doing dumb stuff you know what you're you're [Laughter] smart you're you you're a very bright person person just don't do that again but that's how God dealt with the idian you see amen praise God now the the thing is is that we can't grow amen if if we're not challenged if we're not challenged or stretched in any way we're not going to be able to grow amen the Christian life is about growth right therefore we have to be challenged by something in life even Paul amen had a challenge in his life that he asked God multiple times take it out of me and God said no my grace is sufficient he didn't want that out of his life not because God didn't care for him or not because God was not concerned about that challenge that he had amen but it was because that what was keeping him humble it was keeping him in prayer it was keeping him in humility and meekness and and doing what he wanted him because ultimately who gets the glory is God praise the Lord Jesus amen so we can't we can't grow if we're not if we're not challenged in life amen if we're not if we're not going beyond our comfort zones and this is where Gideon was at amen this is what God was trying to do with Gideon amen was trying to get him out of his comfort zones because why God knowing the beginning from the end he knew what at what Gideon was going to do he had had to get him out of that wine press amen get him out of that Comfort Zone in order to get him to do what he wanted him to do praise God you know God has a plan for each and every one of us and sometimes we Buck at that we Buck at it and and and we're like I I don't know listen me included I I no I don't I don't I don't want that in my life well God If he if he loves you and I know he does he's a gentleman and he's not going to force you to do anything he's going to wait until you willingly want to walk in his word until you willingly want to walk and what is his word his will amen when you willingly want to walk in his will amen then God is going to be able to use you to do the Wonders that he wants to do through your life that's right listen I I I was really blessed by Sister Melissa's test testimony on Sunday how many heard his her testimony you know when sister Melissa she she she she didn't realize amen the impact that she was going to have by making the decision that she made about not wearing the the the pants scrubs at at at at at at at church at at the hospital it was she was wearing them the whole time but but then finally something happened said you know what I want to be a witness for real amen and when she did that things changed now everybody was like wait a second she has bravery enough to do that and other women started coming up to her asking her what can how can I do that now she's getting ready to talk to 7 what 77,000 people they in the in the in the whole uh medical system there about how the the length of it needs to be and and and all of that that's amen that's God right there but It ultimately took her to make that decision right God didn't force her to make that decision something amen that she she got a re a revelation of some sort and Revelation amen causes you to see things differently amen it causes you to to act upon things in a different way when something truly has been revealed to you that's amen you see things in a different way why isn't others seeing them that ways because God revealed it to you amen right thank God for God's revelation thank God for his word has being revealed to you why why are people so excited why are those people so excited about God's word amen it's because they the word has been revealed to them and that's why they're they that's why they they can't get enough of it because they've seen something in God's word amen amen when when the Lord takes you out out of your comfort zone amen you see the reality that's ahead of you in a different way and that's what happened to Gideon because because look what look look what happened to Gideon well we'll really here in a moment because I want you to notice that here in in this same chapter Gideon um he almost had like a it it was I Won't Say I'm not saying it's the new birth but it's almost like a type kind of happened there because here in in judges 6 verse verse 19 it says here and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an EPA of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the Oak and presented it he presented it before this this this man that appeared to him and the angel of God said unto him take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This Rock in other words upon an altar amen and pour out the broth and he did so and look what the what the angel of the Lord did and the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the UNL cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and done leaven cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight amen it was almost how is it that God wants us to present our bodies as living sacrifices amen and it wasn't until until Gideon amen got to this point amen that he's he's now obeying what this man is telling him to do to present this sacrifice to do this and when he did it the right way when he got born [Laughter] again then God could go in there and sacrifice or or consume it right when you're born again amen you see things differently after that you're not going to see the same thresh and frol the same way again you see see the plan of God differently now you see that God wants to use you in a great way and you see what the potential of of of of your life is is in the word I hope you're understanding what I'm trying to say after this experience that Gideon had right here amen he saw his life different now because now he's telling me I'm a strong man I'm I'm a mighty man of Valor I'm I'm this that and the other I didn't believe him at the moment but now I I present this sacrifice before him he consumes it who fire does something it makes changes for sure praise God in other words Gideon became convinced and when you're convinced you're concerned amen praise the Lord amen that's that's really how A true a you know how a Christian's life should be praise God you should be convinced and concerned brother says it like this now now this thing we have to do if we can believe it and be concerned about it watch if we can believe it and be concerned about it first we've got to be convinced that it is God then we're when we're convinced then we are concerned amen amen if you're not convinced about something you're not going to act upon it right if I'm not convinced amen that that that we need to be in church I'm not going to be in church it's just as simple as that right if I'm not convinced about you know anything in anything in life if that's not become a reality to me or a revelation to me then I'm not going to act upon it amen I'm not going to to do anything about it but it wasn't so with Gideon Gideon was convinced now that God had something amen for him I hope that we're convinced that God has a plan for you you know you might be going through your daily life and and and and going through school and going you know and and not thinking I'm wondering what I'm going to do later on in life but you you know go God already saw that before the foundation of the world he he knows he's waiting you for for you to come and and and and make the decision and make the choice amen that he he knows you'll you'll come to praise God but you have to come to that your own self just as Gideon had to come to it you see the Lord was there telling him you're a mighty man of Valor you're this that and the other but Gideon had to con he had to be convinced of that himself amen and and that's what the new birth does in our lives it convinces us amen that the word is true all the word is true amen and that and that not just the part about me being born again but now I see the whole the whole uh the the whole picture now has become more clear you may not understand everything in detail but you see the essence of things it's one thing that brother brother few years ago when brother Wade and me were talking you know and we were we were we were uh when we were started coming uh here to the church and you know I've been coming to the m a message church since 2000 all that's when I came into the message and and and and but but but then I started seeing things in a in a different way and it was one of the things that he mentioned to me was that you now get the essence of the message you see and that's important amen you get the essence of the message and that's the reason why brother Brandon could say if you don't see Christ from Genesis to Revelation just read over again because it's there it's all about Christ and what is it what did Paul say man Christ in you the hope of glory amen that's what that's what this this thing is all about it's not about rules and regulations and dos and don'ts that's what the world wants to make it that's what the nominal World wants to make it amen but it's it's about Christ Living Through you wanting to do great things through your life amen amen and it's not just about and I know I say these things all the time but it's not sometimes we think that it's great things like I'm going to go to the cemetery up here in Lula next and I'm going to just raise all the dead that are there that's not what God called you to do God didn't call you to go uh and and and I'm going to just heal all the sick at the at the the hospital there in Gainesville that's not what God called you to do maybe he did and I can't I I can't I couldn't argue with that but for the majority of us I don't think God has called us to do that but I see some parents here I see some some families here I see some some brothers and sisters here that maybe God called you as I mentioned last time you know to fold your your husband's socks in a uh in a better attitude you know or you know or or or tell your wife I love you in a not in a way that you feel that you have to do that right but in a way that you really love her I mean she is beyond the Shadow of Doubt she knows that you love her that's what I'm talking about that's what a new birth experience will make you do it'll make you be genuine which is something we're lacking in this nowadays people are not genuine anymore and when you do see a genuine someone that's genuine you notice it because you notice so much much fakery around you it's become a a life of fakery social media fakery AI fakery all kinds of fakery but when you see something true and genuine it stands out because that's what the people are looking for especially if when it's something genuine that's that and that person has a new birth you know that that's Christ showing that genuiness in their life God help us to be more like that I I want be more like that it's hard you know circumstances and situations and things you know you you want to it's so easy to get in your own bubble and and I want to be in my own Island and that's it and and it it's but God wants us out of our comfort zones because God has great things for us to do amen what is the I'm finishing up here what is the word convince mean and here's what it means is completely certain about something brother Brandon preached the message called convinced and then concerned amen and this is what he was talking about completely certain about something amen praise the Lord you sisters who have had children you know that you had those children I mean you're convinced that you had them I could probably ask you the multiple reasons why you're convinced and you would tell me why you felt the pain you you you you you you see them before you amen you know all about it you're convinced amen praise God it also means firm in one's belief firm in one's belief with regard to a particular cause or issue and you know you can actually look at that as a revelation you know when I saw when I saw the uh uh one God Amen you can't take that coming from a nominal world right I know some of us didn't do didn't come from that but coming from a nominal world and when you see one God that stands out big time nobody can take that away from me praise God I can have my my most down day and and and and maybe fail God Amen but you can't take that out of me that's right brother and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ that's that's a revelation that just stands firm amen right praise the Lord amen you're convinced and then what is the part about being concerned look what the word concerned means to become involved with something or worried about something now not worried that you are like biting your nails worried because that actually makes you sick right right right and it makes your finger fingers sting a bit but but you're concerned I mean you're you're you want to be part of that you see right when I when I when I was revealed that water baptism in Lord Jesus Christ was the right way to be baptized I went immediately and got to get go get baptized right that is the concerned part right you do something about it most of us or a lot of us we're convinced that things are true we just don't do anything about it righten we're not concerned enough to do anything about about that that we know is true so we just kind of sit idle in our comfort zones and we just kind of let life happen to us and whatever happens and not knowing that you have a say in things because God has a plan for you right God wants to use you in a mighty way praise the Lord amen and we don't need to be idle praise God so that's what concern means to become involved with something or worried about something amen and so when Gideon became con convinced and concerned here's some of the things that that he was able to do amen by the Lord's command he destroyed baal's Altar and cut down the Grove next to it the whole time that he was there in his comfort zone the his dad had an altar to bail yeah and it was sitting there he wasn't doing anything about it when he was convinced or got the new birth I'm not saying that he did I'm just saying it was a type he had an experience with God let me just say it that way he got convinced and concerned and the Lord said go tear that that that that altar down raise one up for me that's exactly what he did amen why he knew what God what God's word said amen right and when you know what God's word says it puts you to action when you're convinced about God's word it puts you to action Gideon was convinced and he went and tore down that Altar and the man of the city the next day they got up and they said what in the world happened here as what's all this what's all this and they got upset that their altar was destroyed that's right but Gideon didn't care he was doing the Lord's work amen that's what happens when you're convinced and you're concerned you continue P pushing forward amen praise God Amen another thing that he did is Gideon managed to build a very small army of 300 it started I think at as 30,000 or something like that but God said no that's too many to fight the medit and and the medit had like over 200 something thousand but God said now compare 30,000 to 200,000 that's still a big gap there but God said that's still too many so we know the story and he gets it down all the way down to 300 men I can imagine you know with the people the the guys that were with Gideon are like I know Gideon Gideon I know the Lord spoke through you but I know deep down in there they're probably thinking I don't 300 man against 200,000 I'd be scared too and maybe Gideon was probably thinking Lord is this going to work but he was called right amen he was called from the beginning and the Lord told him and said you're going to save Israel right you're going to do it and go with with that your might amen right and of course he defeats the midianites and you can read about it in the chat we don't have time to do that but Gideon also defeats the the their kings Zeba and Zuna not just defeats the midianites but also their kings amen and completely saves Israel right amen when you're convinced and concerned when you're out of your comfort zone then God can use you amen when he was out of his comfort zone then God could use them amen praise God so that's my whole thought amen for tonight amen amen am am am I too comfortable in life maybe God has not have not too many too many trials are happening in my life praise the Lord no you should be worried about that you should be worried amen CU God loves to test his children not because they know that not because he loves to just test them it's because he wants you to realize where you're standing in the position that you're at so that you can move out of that you see God came to Gideon Amen in the position where he was at he was there in the threshing floor minding his own business and in his comfort zone he came in there amen and took him out of his comfort zone right in a in a very in a very uh miraculous way and then after that what happens when you're convinced and concerned you're focused right to move forward with your goal right nothing else amen distracts you anymore things can happen birds will fly over your head and distractions will be there but you're focused on the goal of the mark of the high calling as Paul said amen amen we got to get out of here Saints I'm tired of this pest house it's getting fat and I got to lose weight since November I just went off the deepend and I got to get back to my what I need to do and but man sour gummy worms are so good I just had a whole bag of sour gummy bears last night anyways I want to P I want to if the brothers could help me pull this up for just a moment and with this we're going to finish pull something up here real quick you excuse me when I pull this up I know my my wife and my daughters they'll know they'll know what uh what this is my wife is over there like what is he going to do now what is he going to show can y'all see that now they know now I know know the reason why I'm showing this is because there's a man in brazzleton Georgia he's he's a black guy that he he's a jogger he's he's fit and you know and he looks just like this now I literally typed this in with AI I I I I put in an AI I put please make me a picture with a a guy with a doag on headphones sunglasses and punch in the air and that's what it came out and it was pretty close now the guy when he's jogging he's always always jogs and he's always he always walking really fast this is what he's doing the whole time and he's got his headphones on and he's just Non-Stop and every time I drive by I I I come I go home from work man that made me [Laughter] tired huh I know I need to do that this is what he's doing the whole time and he looks ridiculous but he don't care he is focused and it's always between five between 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. it's always between those times in brazzleton at that time uh there's a lot of traffic there on 211 as some of you all may know a lot of traffic he don't care he's focused on his goal crossing the street still going at it and I don't know how long he does it but every time I look at it I'm like you know what there's a sermon in that you know he's he's pressing on the mark of the high calling for his for whatever he's trying to achieve now he doesn't look quite as as buff as as this guy you know these AI images came out he's he's a thinner guy but he is he's focused I think that's it he's a focused guy but you know what when you're focused and you're convinced about something you're going to do it no matter what anybody else says you're going to achieve what what God called you to do no matter what anybody else says you know the whole world can be you know zooming around you and they're doing their own things they're they're driving their vehicles and you're out there but you're focused on what God called you to do so look as they say stay in your lane man stay in your lane I don't want to sound like I'm I'm talking about you know uh you know you know something making money or whatever like that but I'm talking about stay in your lane spiritual Lane don't get sidetracked there's so much to Sidetrack us out nowadays that's right this man amen and he's he's pretty fit I don't know if he's married and I don't know if he you know he may have a car at the house maybe he doesn't I don't know I wanted I want one day to just stop by and tell him hey you know what what motivates you to to do that I've never seen a a person jogging in the middle of the road just doing this and he's non-stop the whole time but he's focused maybe God just put him there for me to to help me stay focused amen don't let every other thing around you just Sidetrack you amen don't let every other trials and situations and problems and other people amen Sidetrack what God's called you to do stay in your lane and God can use you amen that's what Gideon had to do and that's what God wants to do with you amen praise God stay stay focused amen stay and let and let God Amen get us out of our comfort zones when he needs to amen thank God Amen for that amen amen you love the Lord amen God bless you and have the musicians [Applause] come amen maybe one day I'll follow behind the man maybe you might see me doing that and I can get to his level praise God how many love the Lord amen you know sometimes we could just take the word amen simple simple uh simple uh examples in the word and just apply them in our lives and and uh it's it's it's going home time Saints amen and and and and so what's what we want to do praise the Lord just stay focused in this hour last time we talked
