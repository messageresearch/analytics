Fellowship hearing around the word of the Lord and I had in some XYZ we used to like XYZ we used to go wherever and we love that man we you know we there's people that live to party on the weekends so do I this is my party this is where I've this is where I set all my goal is to come here and I want to eat and drink the word of God Amen all right and that's what should be our desire it should be a as we're going to look at today it should be a a fervent a burning desire not just a well I gotta go all right that's what we're coming to that's what the statue of perfect man is it's going to put us into the image of God well what is the image of God it's God all right in another form called The Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time and that's us the son of man in a group of people but we got to have the son of man Ministry we've got to have listen we're just getting back to the first church everybody with me the first church age Paul Peter James John irenius even had these virtues working in a life working in their life working in their life not just not just dormant working in their life and that's what we need to get back to that and then add that headstone which they didn't have the headstone was taken away and now the headstone's back in the son of man Ministry The Headstone is Jesus Christ and he's in the body now getting us ready for a Rapture getting us ready for a body change all right there is going to be a healing one day that's not going to be temporary healing is temporary you can be you can have a headache today come pray for you totally be taken care of and the next morning you wake up you got a headache because you're still living in a sinful body or a body made from sin and then you got then we can't fathom having a day without a headache or a heartache or a trouble or a trial or a ache or a pain we can't fathom that but that's what we're going to that's what we're heading toward it's going to truly be a change and no so but as the song says Oh What A Change what in my life I got to do that first before I can get to that so let's keep these things in prayer Pray about these meetings and the different things Brothers come in some uh we got some on vacation now with brother Aaron's um leaving I think now but he's was it brother Tom Christian's uh brother Louise should be gone next weekend to Orlando for the Bible being before yeah

news amen so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day we appreciate Lord the brothers and sisters that took out time to consider time they'd get their effort Lord for you and father I pray that it will not return void that it will accomplish what it said it would do father that means that you will help us Lord not be walking zombies but we will be living instruments of your image and we'll talk about that today Lord that's your whole concern to get the bride ready is to get us back into speaking condition to get us back to where brotherly love means something to where it's not just we shake each other's hand and we leave but there'll be a fervent a fervent um attitude that we have toward our brothers and sisters that does not be something in between us that Lord we'll work as that first church that everything will be in Harmony and everything will be in order father thank you for sending us a prophet that can put these things in order for us we thank you for that Lord we we're such a privileged people to be able to sit under this ministry of the last end time father the Elijah Ministry number four we appreciate that and we thank you for it Lord be with the ones that are sick sister Freedom different ones that that can't get the church Lord we pray that you would bless them Lord Comfort them Sister Mary sister Johnny all the different ones Lord sister Gail that we miss we pray Lord that you'd bring them back together Lord and let's Worship in this building father we ask these things in Jesus name amen the Bible says in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh that was the whole intent for that word to be made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father fall of Grace and Truth fall of Grace and Truth II Peter 1 says besides this what besides the new birth giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge knowledge Temperance tempers patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity you may be seated that's what we've been working we've been working in faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience now we've been on godliness and now we're heading toward brotherly kindness I had this on I guess I must reached back there and cut it off I got I'm on now I thought I was on when I walked out here but okay anyway technology boot devil First Timothy Paul is telling us he says look without controversy great is the mystery of godliness we discussed that this morning great is that mystery because listen I'm telling you 99 of the world thinks they're not perfect not going to get perfect and there is no way to be perfect according to what the uh accepted intelligence of the day is the accepted intelligence of the day is is that we're all just a bunch of goof UPS we we you know we're not perfect we can't live this we can't live that I just wonder if you really sat down with a with a good Baptist or a Methodist or somebody and just just say look what is your opinion what is your thought on being perfect they're going to say well I you know I I'm I'm I'm this I have these issues with this I got a problem with that got this got that the other uh and and you can and what I would say to them they'd make him really mad I'd say well now I know what problem you got the problem you got is it's not that it's your Doctrine it's your Doctrine is what's bad that's right it's your Doctrine start with that start with the doctrine don't worry about I can't quit smoking worry about getting born again and get born again not by the second person of a Trinity right or the third person of the trinity uh and and what's your baptism uh uh what's your manner of life uh do you wear dressers all the time or do you do you do you dress like a man you gonna make him really mad after about right there and then they're gonna jump up and they're gonna say just exactly what I've always said and brother Dale said the same thing you ain't perfect I ain't perfect see they they cop to me that's a cop-out they want to move everything over to the side well the Holy Ghost is the one that's bringing it back over here so you know one thing's for sure they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and their soul they have an anointing that tells them they need all these people that lives right right there's people I mean you good neighbors is like brother Dale always said you know you're good neighbors good neighbors are okay but if good neighbors are not Christians they're going to hell period they might go to heaven because of you but what if you ain't got the new birth hmm sometimes we put all this on well you know my neighbors being good to me you better make sure you're good you better make sure you got the new birth now if you don't have the new birth how can you cover them you can't cover yourself for true amen so let's get our own self covered first and then let them see the mystery of godliness they don't know how we live until they get the same Holy Ghost we got that's what I asked that preacher not too long ago I said look if you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost how do we act different well why why are we acting different sure you like hunting and I like fishing that's Humanity that ain't got nothing to do with with Bible Doctrine how can your Holy Ghost tell you that and then the my Holy Ghost tell me this same way in this message it's the same way we'll get to brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is just being ripped out all over the place nobody has love for anybody anymore even brother random in 1950 he said it's leaving in other words there's no more 1950 man in 1950 of course most of us weren't born but when I was growing up man everybody said hey everybody spoke to each other and now it's like if you hear your neighbor dies you hear it on the on the news yeah that's what I thought but you and I need to change that if we can't live it before our neighbor why we need to live in here if your people at your work don't think you're different you've got a problem if they don't see the difference you got a problem because you know why they're you're acting just like they are so it must be the same thing inside to use what they got in them well I'll preach it anyway but that's just about that's where the rubber meets the road folks and all's going to come down to our minor of life our conduct out there not in here Colossians 1 verse 21 says you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind that's all of us by Wicked Works yet now hath he what he's reconciled and the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unrepute unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Earth where Paul I am made a minister who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of the Affliction of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is who the church wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations is what we're talking about today that's why great is the mystery of godliness but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known so God's going to have to make this known but he's not going to make it known to the newspaper it's not going to make it known to the radio he's going to make it known through flesh your flesh and my flesh no one else can live this Bible folks I'm telling you it's just like back at the Old Testament time you got people that that that the do's and don'ts in the Old Testament that that was a time that that was there but now you and I and I'll read it here in just a few minutes where we've come under a dispensation of Grace and we didn't get in that dispensation of Grace we're all going to hell The Ten Commandments we've already at least one of them ten we have a problem with well you can be quiet all you want to but it's the truth if it wasn't for Grace Now by Grace we can live those Ten Commandments by Grace those Ten Commandments it's not don't make them not in fact make sure you live them amen amen that's right I mean do you have an issue with killing somebody thou shall not kill well Jesus is fixing to tell us he said they say of old well brother Brown said if you kill the influence of a man in the end time you've killed the person you don't have to kill him with a gun you killed their influence you've killed the person right so let's look at that here in just a minute to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus wherefore I also labor striving according to his work which worketh in me mightily so we're talking about godliness and we'll kind of skip through some of the stuff from this morning and get to brother kindness but we looked at reverence and respect piety towards God and then we look we talked about the horse forehead the horse forehead there's no reverence or respect it's just a you know wanting it's whatever you do that's okay if that's who you are that's okay no it's not okay listen we have to live Godly there's somebody going to live this Bible somebody there's a group of people that's and it's not going to be in a group it's going to be individuals but we can be in a group somebody's going to live what God wrote in the Bible you know why because that's why I wrote it remember God can see the end from the beginning so because he can see that somebody came to this he wrote the Bible and make it flow right straight down to where you are today amen y'all don't go to sleep on me already I have to come back and wake you up German chocolate cake think of your favorite sports team maybe that'll keep you awake is that your perfect man brother Brian was talking talk about uh godliness I can't do it brother he said oh yes you can I think that's an outstanding statement he never I mean he explained it all but they said no he said yes you can so you know what that gives me that gives me see there's that door that opportunity that when God sent us a prophet he sent us a prophet to open the door or to open the seal or to open the Bible so that we can maneuver our way through this Bible without stopping and going I can't do that man I can't do that uh my denomination won't let me do that think of what brother Brown says he's talking about Unity talking about he said your denomination won't let you do that ah see that same thing with us our attitude maybe won't let us do that we're working on our attitude come on like sister Nikki he's still working on me what to make me what I ought to be and Lord just keep on just start start hacking come to church read your Bible pray listen to The Prophet's message I can't tell you to do much more it's just do more of that all right and I'm guilty too I need to do more let's just keep striving though come Church read your Bible do the things that God tells us to do not what we want to do in our own mind do what God tells us to do and we should be fine everybody with me it's not something listen if it was so hard that only an elite group of people can do it God would be a respecter of persons he's not a respecter of persons even the most illiterate person can't get born again doesn't take money doesn't take education it takes a willing heart now if we're willing to stay in the world guess what God's going to allow you to do that but if you're willing to put forth the effort effort and say God y'all pray for me my new teeth they won't come out they're glued in but I can hear myself whistling don't say right Luis you didn't do that you didn't hear me but I have to be careful where I spit while I'm talking so just pray for me it's it's something interesting and you can't feel them because they're not attached to you so just pray that we get through this brother boy you'll worry about sooner or later when you get old can't stand him look at the hair on his head at 70 years old Godly jealousy it's just Godly jealousy it's all of this okay this deity comes from the Latin now when you think I think about this the other day and I didn't bring out this morning when you when somebody says okay we're going to talk today about deity what do you think well that's God up there amen shake your head that's God up there deity we have no um we don't sit and think about us being deity we just think about us be stinking humans and we're lost and but we got to come to a place though somewhere where God through a prophet told us if he is now inside of you it's not somewhere even Moses picks it up he said we don't have to go to heaven to get it he said it's right here man it's not thee even in my mouth the word of faith that we preach which paraphrasing a couple of scriptures together but the divine nature of deities is believed to be what actual being the divine nature what is the divine nature of God these virtues that's the divine nature of God all right so the divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal goodness and powerfulness you say well by the way we're not Immortal no we're not but we're heading toward that but I promise you one thing something inside of you that is there's something inside of you that is eternal it is Immortal it can't die there's no way it can die you can't cut this flesh up enough to make it die you just separated and then we're gonna come right back together praise God he's talking about the corn of wheat now watch what brother Graham said the same God within the pillar fire was in Christ Jesus the same one in Christ Jesus is in you that's right God in you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God that's why brother Brown says and I agree 100 the the true New Birth is one of the most uh it's just something that nobody really talks about they just say well you're in the message aren't you or you were born an eagle or or don't you get this feeling when you hear the prophet message and don't you hear this and no getting born again has nothing to do with the prophet don't get quiet there's been New Birth since the since the the day of Pentecost brother Brandon was just over here in just a small section of this church age that we're talking about he's just a small section of it hey man so we need to get Born Again by the word of God we get we need to get Born Again by the Lord Jesus coming into our heart and saving our soul then that makes God in you the hope of glory it's just an ill-talk subject Because unless you get the baptism of holy ghost in your soul you're not born again and I want you to pray uh for a young young man Jim Ellis he's uh he wants to hunt on our in our hunting club in Illinois so um some of y'all knew that I left Monday morning or Sunday night he and I and we drove course this eight hour drive up there and ate our ate our back but we were together for two three days up there working in gym I don't know where these the Methodist or Baptist he likes to drink a little bit says a few little few bad words but he's a good guy he's a beekeeper friend of ours but anyway coming back I didn't bring I didn't bring it up he said well kind of tell me a little bit about your religion I thought oops yeah I know here we go so I just kind of you know I just kind of I said well we're kind of between uh we don't believe speaking in tongues is the evidence but we we don't deny that speaking in tongues is part of the Bible and he agreed I said but we don't and I went through this just a Simple Plan of Salvation told him the story about remember I told you about the banker friend of mine you know John stump we were out there fishing on the lake and and I just got born again and and was living different and and um and they all saw it and that's why John was uh John was asking me is you know what's going on here I said well I I got saved I said I got born again I said I don't do those things no more because he's sitting there drinking a beer cursing you know all day and he just holds the beer up and he says well praise the Lord he said Wade got saved and he said and he said I I'm just glad that I got saved everyone and I'm I looked at him I said John what'd you get saved from what'd you get saved from you gotta save save from what you're doing the same thing you did before so I told that story to Jim but you know what Jim said I about had I about had a fit he looked at me and he said so that's what it means to be born again huh he said so that's what it means to be born again all the whole time may have been a Christian for 20 30 years he had never seen there was a difference he said well I guess I'm gonna have to work on my mouth I said no let the Lord work on your mouth I said let the Lord work on don't worry about it I said listen whatever you say is your business I said but I'm just telling you that to be born again you've got to have a different Spirit than you have now you've got to have a different even perspective our perspective of life is totally different I don't have a perspective that one day me and Jim's gonna get mad at each other and get a divorce that's not that wasn't even in even when I was a sinner that wasn't in part of my vocabulary I asked the whole problem an issue life lesson 785 you ready work on your problems well you burnt the rice I'm divorcing you tomorrow you drive through the drive-through and get a divorce papers I mean it's not that way but it's just about that way that people don't even want to work on anything anymore why they ain't got nothing inside of them they're looking for something better they're looking for something else you and I have the best we have the best in our life we have the best in our life we have the best in our kids you say oh yes we're still believing amen we're still believing I'm not throwing mine out of yours either one but they got to have a change but that just really threw up my soul brought tears to my eyes and he said so that's what it means to be born again I said yeah Jim I said that's what it really means to have to be a Christian to have God in your life and for the world sure I said you saw me this whole time uh Brett the guy that lives up there he's a drinker and a concussion you know I said that don't bother me I said I know he's not changed now he professes Christianity goes to church every once in a while but he's not got a portion of God in him he's still got a portion of you know who in him right but if you ever tried to just just sit down with people and say hey this is what brother Brown say tell them how your fire got lit well I told him how my fire got lit and that when it did light me it burned me up made me a new creation and we start talking about that and you you know making it new make it a a new attitude I said Jim I said we can you know we can hunt and fish and and and talk about things and talk about beekeeping and all that stuff I said I'm fine I said but when you asked me about the word of God I'm going to tell you my perspective my experience I'm going to tell you mine this is how I got saved and look I said and this is he said you don't say no he said you don't slip up saying about when I said no no not in part of my vocabulary now listen I'd be lying to say I didn't think I'm in my head if y'all don't think of me in your head please pray for me but that's just part of life it's part of life the birds fly over but we used to let them build houses in our brains right now we just let them fly right on through and that's the difference when I told Jim I said now Jim you know me we've known each other for probably 10 years beekeeping and stuff I said you know me I said I'm not one that that that lives two different ways or he said no you're the one you're you know you're that way all the time you know there's not a time when we're all up here sitting around drinking and there's not a time when we go over here beekeeping and we have a beer or we he but he did look he said you really you ain't never said a bad word and and I said no remember my testimony I tried to say one one time and the Lord hit me in the chest with his fist and all that came out was there but see God's going to protect his people I'll tell you what he's going to do he's going to protect himself [Music] he's protecting himself inside of you that's what he's doing it's not that he don't care about you but he's protecting himself he's protecting the gift God give you that's what he was doing with brother Brown I'm not so much of brother random was so special we know he was but he wasn't so special that that the the angel said don't smoke or drink or cut I wish that angel would have come to me but you know what he he probably came to all of us you know what we did we left him up in the tree where he talked to us brother Brown took it serious I don't know smoke or drink but now remember brother Randolph didn't now he's six or seven years old when he had that it went that he didn't uh ever get tempted come on he told us he told his uncle or whoever it was give me that bottle right he had an intent on doing what he said he wasn't going to do or shouldn't do right it wasn't and he just sat there and he's like oh no I'm just you know no he had to fight that thing he had to fight what was going on inside of him because he was a human being he said I spread them he said we die with our boots on well we're just alcoholics and we have a hard temper now remember he had a temper he had to work on too I'm going to show you how to selfish Spirit here in just a few minutes I'm just telling you what he said this is not hearsay well it is he said it faith is a substance in 1951 brother Brown said look deity fell on the day of Pentecost it's still falling deity fell on the day of Pentecost it's still falling if it falls on folks we obviously we can't live it but he can leave it to us that's why we struggle and fight I wish you'd just stop the struggling and fighting and get born again if you get born again your life will change listen to what brother Brown said I want you to I brought this in here just for for I want you to clarify something as far as looking at godliness but look on the spoken words Original Seed 1962. now everybody remember brother Branham is preaching away and he preaches like a six-hour sermon right well he's right in the middle of the afternoon service and he said I want you to listen real close here's where the spirit said pick up the pen so listen brother random is not writing this the Holy Ghost is right now so if you got an issue you need to have an issue with the Holy Ghost brother Brown said he said pick up your pen I'd have to leave some of it go but I gotta bring some of it to you brother Bram reads paragraph 414-441. now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction Break Forth of its kind we're talking about godliness now if if listen if God's Godly and we're Made In His Image and that piece of him is in US amen it doesn't make godliness less there's not different levels of godliness like there's different levels of love and we may get to it may not but there are different levels of love there's filial love there's agape love there's lust and brother Brown said then there's filth all right so let's read this just real quick this is what the Holy Ghost is writing to me and you everybody with me all right what Shake Yourself for a minute what y'all need to do is get up everybody bring a bowling ball and set up with that bowling ball and just kind of you know spread your legs out about two feet and I mean one foot about two feet that way the other one right over that bowling ball or right under it you won't fall asleep in well you might one time we'll be praying for your broke toe and a lot of y'all will be praying for you broke foot all right listen this is what now listen this is and everything brother ham said was serious but this was written by the Holy Ghost to me and you everybody with me on this and this is what God is writing he said pick up your pen and write this down now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind Genesis 1 11. these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone now we got to come to all the virtues to get to that right we've got to have the virtues working in our life to get to the headstone will be the Super Church a super race as as in other words as we near the great headstone and that's what we're doing now we're we're at godliness we're not far from that love where the Capstone is there and that Love's going to be a lot different than we think they will be much like so much like him they will be so much like him even they will be in his very image what is the image of God that's the image of God in order to be United with him because remember rubber can't Unite with blocks bricks wood it's got to be the same material we're working on making this the same material all right they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God that was back in we were talking about in uh in the Book of John John 17 when Jesus was telling us three or four times we got to be like one like him and the father now how was him and the father one I kind of skipped that this morning you thought about that how was Jesus and God won they weren't two different people right so are we a separate person that's where our problem is we we we're just a bunch of Tunis we harp on the trinitarians and we harp on the Oneness let's harp on the twoness and let's get true Oneness like brother random like Jesus wanted it to be true Oneness Is Us in the multitude of bride together all right everybody with me then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride of Virgin look a version of his word not our own ideas not our not our thoughts but a version of his word and through them and by them who the bride will be fulfilled all that has been promised this listen this is the Holy Ghost writing to me and you this is not brother Ram's thoughts this is the Holy Ghost writing to me and you fulfill all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed or Dogma The Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now that's us type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word what become virgins and then we accept the seed word of God all right be it unto me as thou has said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was written the written word Isaiah 9 6. look they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head what is his potentials the virtues and they are his subjects subject to his headship of Christ was his that's why I say and that's why all the ministry that true Ministry of the word of God will tell you you've got to have a heads up you gotta have a Shepherd you gotta have a pastor you can't push play and make it right we're not built for that if we were built for that amen hallelujah praise the Lord it'd be so easy but we're not built for that we're built to be talked to every Sunday and every Wednesday by a human being that pours out their heart amen Amen to get you to see God not them notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5 19. so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah here's the secret all right here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word now listen that's only at adoption right how's he going to give you something knowing you're gonna mess up he's God he knows you will he can't give the baby the car keys he's not going to even though little kids like we used to love your kids play around with little little Keys you know for the little play cars well you ain't gonna get in a real car do that same way with God he's come down through all these Church ages and there's pieces being left out man's ideas got involved uh doctrines got involved denominations got involved and the Word was eat down as talk about the restoration of the Bright Tree the word was eat down the effects of the word have been eat down but now it's to come back to be restored in a group of people that does what he says to do and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus said the Lord then it is germatized so the Holy Spirit Waters in until it's grown look and serves its purpose you have a purpose in this if you're a born-again child of God you have a purpose in this whole thing all right you can either be the fingernail or you can be you know the arm whatever it is just Lord just let me be in your body that's what George said just Lord just let me be in the body somewhere they do all hey man I'll believe that brother interjects that no one can persuade this different they have thus at the Lord or they still folks that's what we're preaching if I preach the word of God to you it's thus says the Lord it's touched out the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for he is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill that's where people are missing it they don't really think that God himself has went inside of you and he's working outward because you ain't perfect now ain't perfect my denomination says we can't do that well you know what your denomination is it's a horse forehead for it is himself and them continuing his word to what fulfill as he did complete in his day all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here why he's completing it now for it was not time yet I say today it's time now and I've just got a little snippet of one of the scriptures I read so to the doctrine which is according to Godliness so there is a Doctrine according to Godliness that tells you the doctrine that we have will make you Godly the doctrine we have will make you holy the doctrine we have will make you without spot a wrinkle because I know one thing for sure if I've been Justified what I did in the past God cannot see it if I'm Sanctified today all that old me has been moved out and if I'm born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can't lose you can't lose we have trials and tribulations so what all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution you know why because this world listen this world's mind is not even yours I mean I hope you don't think I hope you don't think like the world we used to did we used to think like the world all of you did we all did before we got morning and we thought just like the world Romans 1 verse 16 says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ that's what I was telling Jim I'm not ashamed that I'm different some people are ashamed I'm not ashamed that I'm different you should not be ashamed right well I'm just different I ain't gonna say nothing well brother Brian said tell him hey fire got lit how you gonna tell him that if you don't talk to him but I really appreciate you know Jim was very tentative and and like you said before I mean afterwards he said I'm gonna have to brush up in other words maybe that'll spark something in his heart to say hey I really don't have what I thought I had and you know what that's good enough for me I want you to realize today that you may not have what you think you've got thank you brother none you're the only one to wait for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for he is the power of God what it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth now let's talk about image just a second because Genesis 1 26 favorite scripture God said let us make man in our image whose image God if you make somebody image that look like God all right after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and follow the air cattle Earth creeping thing that's what Adam had so God created a man in his own image an image of God created in him but remember that image got marred now we're made in the image of Mom and Dad Cain was in the image of Mom and Dad Abel was in the image of Mom and Dad you and I are in the image of Mom and Dad on the Earth but what we gotta look and see that when God created this man it's not in the image of your mom and daddy oh he was we were created in His image so God created man in his own image he has his own personality the image of God created in him male and female created them and God blessed them and God said be fruitful and multiply boy what about that they're multiplying and not even in flesh we think about multiplication we gotta be in flesh spiritual multiplication is way better than natural multiplication see we have to have natural multiplication now because of the Fall but then you have an opportunity to have spiritual multiplication which is somebody preaching the word of God and somebody yet born again that's spiritual multiplication all right be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it see we're not going to subdue this Earth until we're in the Millennium brother Brian there's a quote he tells us that and have dominion over the fish is saying to follow the air and everything that moveth upon the Earth let's look at this word for a second Godly Godly means Theos it's a deity what's this whatever can in any respect be likened unto God or resemble him in any way see brother Donnie was brought here by uh brother and sister Paul Bush right what we're looking at now but brother Brown says hey you don't see the real man you don't see the real man but you know what God thought so much of that image 20 years old you're gonna look like 20 year old Donnie fabush you're not going to look like 20 year old Bob black he taught so much of that DNA that brought your mom and daddy together to get you here bring your bring your quirks bring your attitudes or your disaditudes or whatever be attitudes all of our attitudes and he put that together and said okay hang on just a minute when I go inside that guy he's going to be different when I go inside that sister she's going to be different Mom and Daddy get them here because that was a law that came up back in Genesis that had to be a man and a woman they brought children in sorrow she would be bearing child man would work by the sweat of his bride but thank God the title never happened in the millennium all that'll be done away with it'll be back to the original where we won't have that sorrow and paint and praise God I won't have to water my garden with a water hose praise the Lord whatever can in any respect be likened unto God or resemble him in any way is Godly so he's going to take an image that that looks ungodly hours and he's going to make it Godly to we're going to resemble him by what not by DNA but by birth New Birth and maybe some of us needs it just keep coming back in my mind maybe some of us need to look at what Jim what Jim Ellis said and just say wow is that really what it means to be born again if you've not experienced that then you're not born again I'm so sorry if you've not experienced a change in your life if you cannot tell somebody the change in your life then you need to get born again not that I came not that I just showed up and appeared and started coming to church not that the message sounds good listen I agreed with serpent seat and all them other doctrines when I was 14 and I was lost as a as a blind cat in a me house or a blind dog in a me house I was blind but I could see that and then brother round tells us he comes up and he says that's just common sense hey man he said that's your common sense to see that well that was pretty much common sense for me to see what happened in the garden because I knew what my problem was at 14 years old well praise the Lord anyhow y'all didn't go through it bless you uh I have books about that God's representative or vice region of magistrates and judges in other words somebody that resembles the Creator you and I have here are here today to resemble the Creator the only way you can resemble is to be made in His image second Timothy 3 11 persecutions afflictions which came unto me in Antioch and Iconium and lifestra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me praise the Lord can anybody have that anybody has that testimony anybody has that testimony well we'll pray for you all the other ones because you're fixing to get one but out of them the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live Godly in Christ now Paul is telling us listen I'm trying to live Godly the best I can and I'm gonna I've been suffering all this persecution listen folks they'll persecute you and not even know it because you're so different as I said before what brother dick says is your your spirit irritates their demons and that's kind of the way it is but able man and Seducer shall wax worse and worse look deceiving and being deceived so it's not going to get better for them it's just going to get worse all right so that's godliness so let's move to brotherly kindness just for a few minutes and then we'll take communion second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith verse you diverse your knowledge and all those temperaments temper patience patience godliness and brother godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity we're right up here to where we need to be but I want us to watch some of the things we'll go we'll go through some other stuff with brotherly kindness because it's kind of a broad broad spectrum it means Philadelphia we know that love of the Brethren love of brothers and sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament the love which Christians cherish for each other as brethren all right also Philadelphia's which love as a Brethren loving brothers and sisters in a broader sense it's loving one like a brother loving one's fellow Countryman of an Israelite or of a Christian loving Christians you said that's real easy no it's not Matthew 24 12 give us a a pretty dire situation and because iniquity shall abound he's talking about the end time remember Matthew 24. Matthew 24 is the seals all right Matthew 24 says that because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold First Peter 1 verse 22 says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren you know what that word unfeigned means undisguised or sincere there's no way it's you think I don't love my wife because it's undisguisable I love her with all I got do you some of y'all don't even hold hands you ought to try it sometime preach brother I will unto and your sister should be going yeah unto unfeign the love of the Brethren which means undisguisable uh he's talking about a Prophet by the way this morning yeah that's that's that's his quality right there his love for even the people that hate him was so undisguised he loved them all he just throwed the love out there and I believe he did it sincerely but but watch what the Paul says he says under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love wonder I mean Peter will love one another with a pure heart fervently undisguised uh don't just shake your hand and say God bless you really mean it I want God to bless you is that same thing we do with uh with our WhatsApp you know we we send little hands up you know and we send the little hearts out we send a little smiley faces out I mean is that just just to move it out of the way and going about your life please pray for me well I send them too but I stop and pray right there because I I'm 63 years old I might forget I pray right then and I don't care where I'm at amen don't just send up a Emoji emojis ain't got good I'm not good I'm not going there never mind Bible says being born again not a corrupt but I'm incorruptable by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever 1958 watch this because we're going to talk about Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness so they're they're kind of interchangeable so watch this just a minute and then we'll take communion here in just a minute 1958 anything that had a beginning has to have an end all right we know that all right so the love you have for your wife is going to end it sure will I'll prove it to you anything that had a beginning has an end why were you so quiet about that that didn't mean you unlove your wife it just means you're gonna love her way up here instead of down here uh agape love is not conditional filial love I'm sorry you can tell me all you want to I love and I do I love my wife unconditionally but taste times I don't love her as much as I do the day before but now I'm not coming by The Godfather I'm talking about I'm talking about uh selfish love we'll get into that in just a second anything that had a beginning has an end thank God he's not that way hey man come on thank God he's not that way I'm glad that we can realize that kind of love is unwavering love I believe he loved Judas his care out of his Humanity he he said friend come on man why are you doing this I know you got to do it but I enjoyed being around you and not the way when people leave here or even people that you're acquainted with and all of a sudden like like take brother Tim hymns for example I like to fellowship with him I don't fellowship with him now because we're not of The Same Spirit I just don't see that but I do love him I love him I'll go I still pray for him all right did you ever think of that God the Great Master rainbow in the sky we'd say it like that with the seven spirits of God red perfect love after that comes feel your love from Agape to feel your love that's the love that you have for your wife if some man would insult her you'd shoot his brains out see because it causes or creates a jealousy but that's filial love look secondary love it's not it was created it was created love it should have never been filial love they should never been lust they should never have been perversion there was Agape Love in the in the garden before the fall all right listen then comes the lust for another man's wife then comes filth see it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning and it will have no end it's that Genesis 1 26 man that was made in His image you are then a Son of God and a daughter of God and your affections are on things above feel your love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference all right ready for this one 1958 baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the first great spirit of God which is love God's like the great rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like but just say you look like the rainbow in spirit the perfect Spirit of love red blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship just all perfect spirits and then they begin to condescend begin to condescending coming down and they come all the way down to filio love or agape love to feel your love and on down to lust and down to the lowest and when God himself became man Jesus he came down that same way to the lowest pits of hell and picked out those who he knew before the foundation of the world whose names were written on the book and redeemed them back to himself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and stand in his likeness the full Plan of Redemption cannot be seen and here comes feel your love or agape love feel your love lust and then on down to perversion what are we looking at we're looking at Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness that's the love for the brothers love for the Sisters but when we get over on on the other side all that love is going to be in agape love amen brother Brown hugged those sisters over there and didn't bother him again I love poor blessed brother Ernie villain away with his heart he's passed on but he'd always tell mama he said sister Dale said I just love you so much he said I can't hug you here he said but I'll hug you in the millennium and that's true there's so much love now you just useful you have to and Mama gets hugged by a lot of people because she's Nanny and that's okay that's a bother I hope that don't bother nobody's feelings I think it's all right but now I'm not gonna go hugging Bob's two daughters no way why because you get to thinking about something and everybody else gets to thinking about perversion and all this other thing but when we're on the other side see there's not degrees but I'm telling what are you saying brother I'm saying we need to learn that now to be respectful be respectful of what you do be respectful of of sisters and brothers and be respectful when you come to the house of God to the minister of this preaching give him your attention give him your full full just for at least for a little while give him your attention because you know what he may be speaking from God to you and that's the only way you say well I'll I'll talk to God when I get home I doubt it I doubt it anybody want to make me a doubt I doubt it right here is right here I hear him clearly here because I want to hear one brother Bob brother Aaron Brother Louise different ones even the Sunday School teachers when they bring something and it brings Clarity that's not Humanity that's God because listen I'm telling you amen the devil does not want you to learn about God he does not to make you forget God worry about what's going on at home at the moment amen worry about everything in the world but what but God and what he's saying to the people you love the Lord let's stand our feet listen there is no way that we're going to make it without each other we're just not I got to have I got to have a head I've got to have brother Dale that teaches me even though he doesn't have to say a word right now the teaching back before is helping me I'm I'm sorry I hate to I'm going to toot my horn I listen to what brother Dale said while he was preaching all right I'll listen to it so I don't have to I don't have to wonder what he said it was ingrained in me but you know what the Holy Ghost job is to do one thing to lead you and guide you into all truth and bring to your remembrance the things that were said now today you may not remember out of this one hour you may not remember 10 minutes of it but that is your 10 minutes that God is speaking to you it may be brother Donnie's 10 minutes and maybe brother Ryan's 10 minutes there's one thing about old brother Ryan he'll send you a little note and say that was good spot on he ain't doing it to get he ain't doing it get took out to eat either he ain't doing it for he needs to go eat good grief all right let's go to the communion it anybody have a need and we need to be prayed for we'll head on into the communion and foot washing the Lord bless you I appreciate you we're gonna like I said we're going to start in brotherly kindness and we'll talk about selfishness next Sunday actually that was on here and it blanked itself out I don't know if the Lord didn't want us to talk about it today or not but it was on this that's why I hesitated a few minutes ago at the very end of this what I showed you on the screen because it was all the definition of selfish and what brother Brown said about having a selfish spirit so maybe we'll do it next Sunday that's the Lord tells me to stop let's go to communion all right but but let's just remember one thing selfishness if you'll look at selfishness just think about it when we grow up as kids we're selfish if we're untrained and untaught a kid is selfish my toy mine mine mine mine mine mine mine never never hardly ever will you get a kid to go well here play with my toy no you usually have to smack him pretty good and take the toy away from him and give it to the kid that's coming to visit right because that's because of selfishness because of what happened in the Garden of Eden Eve was selfish she didn't want to share it with her husband she wanted to do it herself it made her selfish and God said I hate that I hate that First Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you let's do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this new year as often as you drinking in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord what is the body of the Lord You and Me but let a man examine himself that's why we announce communion several weeks in advance get ready pray ask the Lord to take all that claim my slate Lord dump all that in the sea I don't want I don't want it brought up because if not if I miss something I could be eating and drinking damnation for he that eateth and drinketh on word leaves and drink contamination to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak look that means it is happening it was happening in Paul's time in the Corinthians they're coming to the table eating and as as you know brother Ryan said different once they were coming and drinking and getting drunk and they just were having a it was just a feast to them no it's a solid should be a solemn time thinking of what the Lord did for us for this caused many or we can sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged read the scripture a few minutes ago we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world that's what I've been telling you for this whole today if you're separated if you have the new birth God in your soul you don't have to separate yourself from the world you're already separated from the world and whatever condemnation they get will never affect you never because you're born again you're locked in over here on this side sure we may have a lot of trials and tribulations and I was thinking the other day just for a second you know you you look at people and like brother John was talking about the the financial part of our of our life uh and and you'll be telling a lie if you said money in your pocket didn't feel better than not having any that's what I thought but what are you doing with that extra that you got in your pocket that we should not be condemned with the world the world's going to be condemned you and I are not to me that's the greatest money in the pocket there ever was all right to me folks that's safety if you'll learn how many of us have been places you didn't feel safe many it don't feel good does it but you got there and you ready to leave but what about I was telling the brother yesterday he's calling he had been Church in a while and he said he said he said brother wait he said I've got this Spirit on me that that people are trying to kill me pray for the brother I don't have to tell you who he is he said he said everywhere I go I think somebody's trying to kill me I saw a brother you quit coming to church I said if you'll come to church I said I promise you they ain't one person in this building trying to kill you except the preacher right we want to all die we want everybody needs for sure but but we're safety is here but see Satan wants to pull you apart this is the greatest safety net you'll ever get is to be among Believers because you ain't got to worry about just name 20 different things you don't have to be worried about definitely don't have to worry about me killing one to kill Ryan they sometimes don't want to choke him but I don't want to kill him you didn't know that did you you do now beware but they're safe and they're safety here what God's give us he's given us safety to come into a building and to be around brothers that you don't have to make sure you billfold like Tom used to keep his in his front pocket and and he kept it rubber band of course he had about that much money in his pocket he's done going on now so don't worry about it but but he had that in that front pocket so nobody could take it out of his back pocket well now he didn't do that at church you do that when you out yonder you ought to feel safe in here it ought to be comfortable some of you make it too comfortable when it comes to nap time we're for my brother and when you come together to eat Terry one for another so we're gonna do that in a minute feeding man hunger lady meet at home in other words Paul said hey you're not eating at a buffet table and saying it's communion we're going to take this solemn uh listen it's not a joy to eat that bread okay I know somebody like some people in this congregation likes to eat because they get the biggest pieces but but as far as sitting down and eating a meal is that's not what this is this is separate from that this is something we should do and and when we take that we should say Lord you took stripes for me you you drank you you didn't even drink the bitter vinegar they put it through your mouth and you spit it out because you know why because he said you're not going to eat this or drink this with me till we get over there so he didn't drink any more after that If any man hunger lady meet at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come Paul said when I get back I'm going to set some other things in order so let's have just a moment of Silent prayer brother round said pray for you Pastor pray for our um department heads here in different places pray for the bride and ask God to just clean your slate now just just get everything out don't let you know don't be condemned um get it out get it out of your get it out of your system that's what I always say just get it out of your system you know what give it to God we'll ask you blessings Lord in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread blessed it Lord Jesus thank you for this part of this ordinance that we have that we can stand here and know that this Bread is made with holy hands another thing that is done with godliness involved it's not just bought from a place a bunch of ungodly people have touched it Lord it was made with holy hands and it was made here Lord that that we could take this today and participate in this place and in this church Lord we can partake of this and and realize that your body was beat to hamburger meat and you took every one of those stripes for every one of us you took all the nails Thorn Prince spearing aside Lord thank you for that that we don't have to Lord may this be a solemn time and that we hear from you Lord we've seen healings by just taking communion Lord because it's a closeness that we need to come to you father just thank you for this now in Jesus name amen yeah we've we've seen people heard several people healed seen one healed seeing the Lord move and somebody jump up and start speaking in tongues and giving communion to somebody at home and uh let it be a time of Miracle like I said don't let it be a time of just why I'm you know I'm taking this bread no you should feel a closeness I I don't feel close today because Jim's not here that's a natural that's the natural part but we know God's hair I I know he is I don't know what do you do or not don't let him pass you by please don't let him pass you by he's here he gets to church and you know what he's ready to give you anything you want he said do this in remembrance of him so remember him when you do this all right remember what's going on and remember if you got something in your life I haven't been living close enough to God I know I haven't I've been doing other stuff other things not bad I'm talking about just you know working and and getting the garden ready and all that stuff and and uh hurrying up and studying I don't like to hurry up and study I like to let it flow so just pray for me that I get some of that stuff out of the way all right dear Lord Jesus thank you for this wine Lord it was made Lord to be taken just for this opportunity not to be drank at home as a drink or or like tea or something Lord that's that's um some frivolous something we do lord it's it's made for one purpose when it's made it goes in a in a jar he goes in The Jug and it's poured into these little bitty cups and it's partaken by your bride so Lord I pray that you would sanctify Lord this wine Lord and the partakers in Jesus name amen Come Morning how warm by the river I'll rest needs the evergreen tree I will carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you know he's talking with the with Jim it it was a probably an hour or more that I went through scripture and went through situations and things telling them you know not just what I just told you that was just a small snippet of it but I was thinking I thought Lord don't don't make me look so arrogant and different that he shuts down because you can I mean you can start telling people about this and you start and they're like you think you're perfect you know but praise God that didn't happen scripture started coming and and I was using some quotes from brother Brandon I just didn't tell him but uh that's okay when it comes to you when it comes to your memory you need to say it so I just kind of went through scripture and I said well what about this holy ghost thing Jim I said I said over there it says he's a comforter and said he would come back and not be just beside you but in you so now if I'm Gonna Act like the world that can't be inside me because I'm controlled by the inside guy so I just you know I just laid that out and we you know we were um uh heading toward I'll tell you exactly where it was at we were actually close to uh Monteagle Mountain coming back uh toward Chattanooga on 26 and and I just said Lord I just don't want that to be where he shuts it off and he thinks well this you know you're just so good tell you know Mr Goody Two Shoes you know you don't cuss you don't drink you know and I just tried to explain him I said look there's there's a motivation inside of me and I didn't say it but he realized smart enough to realize that he wasn't motivated by the same thing I was motivated because when he turned around I didn't know what he was going to say brother Michael I didn't know what he because I could see him out of the corner of my eye you know he's just kind of looking like this straight ahead and I thought he fixing to hit me here I am going up Monteagle Mountain that's not a good place to get whacked on but he just kind of turned like that and he said so that's what it means to be born again I said yeah that's what it means to be born again I said it just makes you different you're not like the world I said look I said and I told him we used to go hunting in South Carolina and that was just a bunch of Drinkers and smokers um Good Guys not not belligerent they didn't they could control themselves to a degree but uh you know brother Dale he he'd be walking by and you got enough you need some more two more let's just hang on a minute we'll get two more that's great I wish that happens every time fill them all up fill my cup Lord and fill their cut all right I just I want everybody to take communion that means that things are going at least going right for the moment all right but let's just continue this thing on to the coming of the Lord and and back to what I was saying so he said that and and it was it was it was like and then the second statement was it wasn't like well okay that was just no something went off because he he felt condemnation immediately he said so I got to start doing better he said because I let him slip every once in a while and he does because I heard him you know I said well yeah I said well as you work on it at least you know to work on it um and then knows the difference between just being religious and having the new birth because there's a big difference huge difference all right everybody ready you ready yeah we're good all right let's take amen when I talk to people of course I asked the Lord just from to say for him to say the right thing but I think Lord they don't hear this every day they're just like well you know you ain't perfect I ain't perfect we're good my denomination says my church says come as you are well that's okay this church says coming you are too but don't leave as you came we believe in a change we don't believe in just continuing on the same way you are because even when even in in Redemption it's you know when you when you repent what does it do you turn and going another Direction that's what I was telling you Jim I said I said that's what I was telling John stump I said well John what'd you get saved from I said you're doing the same thing he's doing when I met you the first time several years ago and he just kind of looked at me bewildered I said well if I knocked you off of this boat and you couldn't swim and I reached and got you pulled you back in the boat where it was safe that's saving you you were drowning I said so you're telling me I can knock you off the boat and you can go ahead and drown and still be a Christian I never thought about that way when people tell you that sometimes it's okay but sometimes it's a cop-out they're just like I'll leave me alone you know so I just left him alone but the only light they're going to see is going to be me and you the only light they're going to see True Light let me put it that way the only true light they're gonna see is me and you so let's go to the foot washing scripture let's pull it up on the screen John 13 says supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand that he was come from God and he was getting ready to go back to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wipe him with the towel with he was girded he rises then comes he to Simon Peter well here's Peter and Peter said Lord do you wash my feet dust I wash my feet Jesus said what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter he knew the dead Pentecost was coming Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell Jesus never you'll get an answer just don't tell him never all right Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash your if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head see Peter had to take some of that selfishness away you know washing my feet all right and you know why because Peter figured he was gonna have to turn around and watch Jesus's feet which he didn't but later on he washed his other disciples feet when they got the Holy Ghost Jesus said to him he that is washed and he is not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever wet but you're clean but not all for he knew you should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so that would tell me that he washed judas's feet Judas was still there when this was going on somewhere in all this Judas left and went and did what he's supposed to do so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your master Lord Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I've done to you very very I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you everybody happy are you if you do them it's happy time when I come to communion when I want I want to watch people's feet I want to I want to commune and get closer to God how you get closer to God get closer to your brother um novel
