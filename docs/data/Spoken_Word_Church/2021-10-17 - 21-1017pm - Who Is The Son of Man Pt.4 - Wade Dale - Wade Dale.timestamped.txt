[18:08] before thanksgiving wow it's already
[18:10] thanksgiving almost
[18:12] so anyway all right so let's turn to
[18:15] john 1 1 and continue our thought
[18:18] um
[18:19] i'm kind of enjoying it too we're not
[18:20] even really got into the meat of it yet
[18:22] we're just kind of trying to explain who
[18:24] the son of man is but we got to get into
[18:25] the characteristics of it and then we
[18:27] got to bring it home we got to bring it
[18:28] to us
[18:30] we give it a little bit but you we got
[18:31] to bring it into where the son of man
[18:33] the son of man becomes evident
[18:36] in the bride
[18:38] and the evidence will be there
[18:40] amen i'm looking for signs and wonders i
[18:43] mean you're not you know you're not
[18:44] supposed to be built on signs and
[18:45] wonders but i'm telling you if when the
[18:46] son of man
[18:47] fully hits the earth what happened when
[18:50] the son of man fully hit the earth 2 000
[18:52] years ago there were signs and wonders
[18:55] amen
[18:56] and brother brown said it pop like
[18:58] popcorn
[18:59] god will anoint a church then
[19:01] well i believe that's when that church
[19:03] realizes who she is
[19:05] that she's she still is the son of god
[19:08] you still listen that's your new birth
[19:10] don't ever
[19:11] throw that out and say well we don't
[19:13] need to know you're throwing the baby
[19:14] out with the bathwater
[19:15] all right you've still got the son of
[19:17] god's what's inside of you that's what
[19:19] was inside jesus
[19:21] that was a that's why they said you're
[19:22] the creator they knew there was
[19:24] something different but they couldn't
[19:25] understand
[19:27] that
[19:28] and that flesh being god
[19:30] so that's the whole thing and that same
[19:31] thing with me and you they won't mind us
[19:33] talking about first one thing in another
[19:36] about how good our church is and how
[19:37] good people cook squash casserole
[19:40] but when you start talking about and you
[19:42] get it down to what jesus was talking
[19:44] about i am the resurrection in life
[19:47] if you don't believe in me
[19:48] you're dead
[19:50] now buddy that's when they left the
[19:51] house now that was the son of man
[19:53] talking though
[19:56] we're going to get over that a little
[19:57] bit further where the son of man stood
[19:59] one day and he said the son of man can
[20:00] forgive sins on earth how do you think
[20:03] brother branham in his first part of his
[20:04] ministry he couldn't
[20:06] give a grace of marriage and divorce
[20:08] we'll look at just a minute how we got
[20:10] to progress up to it because
[20:12] moses had to progress to a place to
[20:14] where god could show him his form
[20:17] and i'll read in the bible where god
[20:19] told moses okay moses you've got to this
[20:21] place i'll honor it now i'll show you
[20:23] who i am and that's the same way with me
[20:25] and you
[20:26] that we got to come to a place where god
[20:27] will honor and come on the scene and we
[20:30] and that see that entails adoption and
[20:32] all the the great things that we that we
[20:35] already know but we need to go over
[20:37] again so just keep us in your prayers
[20:39] john 1 verse 1
[20:41] to heavenly father we pray lord that
[20:42] you'll be with us today
[20:44] lord sanctify us for this journey
[20:47] forgive us of our sins and our many
[20:48] mistakes that we make lord we truly know
[20:50] that we're sinners saved by grace but
[20:52] this thing that's inside of us called
[20:54] the holy ghost
[20:55] is perfect
[20:56] and that's what you're looking to lord
[20:58] you're looking to that part of us
[21:00] but now i pray that that part of us will
[21:02] work its way out lord and that we will
[21:04] become better christians we will as you
[21:06] did lord learn by the things you suffer
[21:09] that will become lord
[21:11] you
[21:12] made manifest in another form called the
[21:14] bride
[21:15] father lord give us our daily bread be
[21:17] with the ones that are not here the ones
[21:19] that are sick touch us all in body and
[21:21] spirit father in jesus name we pray
[21:24] amen
[21:25] all right in the beginning was the word
[21:28] and the word was with god and the word
[21:29] was god
[21:31] the same was in the beginning with god
[21:33] all things were made by him and without
[21:35] him was not anything made that was made
[21:37] now see he's talking about the son of
[21:38] god
[21:39] because we just read this morning what
[21:42] was the son of god the logos the one
[21:43] that came out and said let there be so
[21:45] that's what he's talking about now but
[21:46] he's gonna he's gonna work his way all
[21:48] the way down to verse 14 and that's the
[21:50] son of man
[21:52] because that word's got to be made flesh
[21:55] amen
[21:57] prophet god said one time we'll read it
[21:59] later on word becoming flesh flesh
[22:01] becoming word amen you got to get it all
[22:03] together all right as brother donnie's
[22:05] we were talking about hebrews
[22:07] a body that has prepared me and that's
[22:09] exactly what it is it's a body
[22:12] thou hast prepared me and him was life
[22:14] and life was the light of men
[22:16] and the light shineth in darkness and
[22:18] the darkness comprehended it not
[22:20] there was a man sent from god whose name
[22:22] was john
[22:23] the same came for a witness to bear
[22:24] witness to the light that all men
[22:26] through him might believe
[22:27] he was not that light
[22:29] but he was sent to bear witness of the
[22:30] light you know
[22:33] remember john wasn't born again
[22:36] not a baptist
[22:39] no least in the kingdom's greater than
[22:41] john what's the kingdom the baptism of
[22:42] the holy ghost
[22:43] the least and the king that's why he
[22:44] couldn't be that light
[22:46] he was there to show the light and to
[22:48] say hey turn and look this is where the
[22:51] light is i'm not the light now we know
[22:53] it was a great prophet we know he's
[22:54] going to heaven but he was not bribed
[22:58] amen
[22:59] if he had been bribed
[23:01] he wasn't asked three months later after
[23:03] they put him in prison for his disciples
[23:05] to go back and said are you the one
[23:06] that's supposed to come or do we need to
[23:08] seek another one
[23:09] the prophet of god said his eagle eye
[23:11] got filmed over well he didn't have the
[23:12] holy ghost to tell him any different
[23:16] or he would he wouldn't ask that
[23:17] question
[23:19] there wasn't something there you know
[23:20] there was not something there so he
[23:21] wasn't the light
[23:24] but he was sent to bear witness of that
[23:26] light
[23:27] see that's the difference in me and you
[23:30] you and i are going to become that true
[23:31] light
[23:34] that was that true light now that light
[23:37] true light is where it's inside of you
[23:38] today
[23:41] he was in the world
[23:42] the world was made by him
[23:45] and the world knew him not
[23:47] he came unto his own and his own
[23:48] received him not but as many as received
[23:50] him to them gave he power to become the
[23:53] sons of god
[23:54] even to them that believe on his name
[23:56] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[23:57] thou shalt be saved
[23:59] which were born not of blood nor the
[24:01] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[24:02] nicodemus but of god that's what
[24:05] nicodemus went back to he said i gotta
[24:06] go get back in my mother's womb he put
[24:08] it all toward flesh
[24:10] nothing to the spirit all right but
[24:12] jesus said no you've got to be born from
[24:14] above
[24:15] that first verse what's killing you
[24:16] nicodemus
[24:18] which were born out of blood nor the
[24:20] will of the flesh not all the will of
[24:21] man but of god and the word was made
[24:24] flesh now back up there in verse 1 in
[24:25] the beginning was the word word was with
[24:27] god and the word was god
[24:29] so this god this word is going to become
[24:32] flesh
[24:34] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[24:35] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[24:37] the father full of grace and truth and
[24:39] by the baptism of the holy ghost the
[24:42] word was made flesh in you amen you may
[24:44] be seated lord has blessings to the
[24:46] reading of the word because remember as
[24:48] we were talking this morning
[24:49] we came flesh first fall in condition we
[24:52] came by sex should not have come that
[24:53] way but there was a part of god
[24:57] that was not born from a mom and a daddy
[25:00] there's a part of god that he created
[25:02] genesis 1 26 let us make man in our own
[25:05] image
[25:06] he's the only one that can do that
[25:08] amen amen he was born of a woman
[25:12] job said is what shorter days and full
[25:14] of trouble
[25:15] so that's our problem we were born from
[25:17] a woman if we start if we're born again
[25:19] we're born from a man
[25:21] amen
[25:22] amen we're born from a man when you get
[25:25] born again you get the person of jesus
[25:27] christ not a woman
[25:29] now you become the bride
[25:32] but remember i thought
[25:34] they were one
[25:36] i thought adam and eve were one when
[25:37] they come together they were one they
[25:39] were actually one flesh the same will
[25:41] week but remember
[25:43] the son of man came word first and the
[25:46] beginning was the word
[25:47] where was with god that's why jesus
[25:49] could stand and say before abraham was i
[25:51] am
[25:53] he could tell him all these things
[25:56] because he was
[25:57] the word first then that word became
[26:00] flesh
[26:02] and dwelt among us see that's the
[26:03] difference like i said before
[26:05] in the son of man and a son of man a son
[26:08] a son of man
[26:09] is born of sex
[26:11] then comes into the body of christ by
[26:13] the baptism of the holy ghost the son of
[26:15] man
[26:18] behold a virgin shall conceive
[26:21] isaiah
[26:22] said behold the virgin shall conceive
[26:24] now that is the son of man
[26:26] so you and i can't be the son of man in
[26:28] a in one body so william branham could
[26:31] not be the son of man in one body
[26:34] because he was born of of of charleston
[26:36] ella branham amen but when he was born
[26:39] from above
[26:40] that put him in a whole another category
[26:43] amen
[26:44] all right so now
[26:45] we were looking here at genesis 3 15
[26:48] and i'll put enmity
[26:50] this is to me this is one of the
[26:51] greatest scriptures because it's it's
[26:53] telling the story whole story
[26:55] even of the old testament and the new
[26:57] testament now you got to read between
[26:59] the lines and put in all the bulls and
[27:00] goats and all the moses and all the
[27:02] isaiah's and then you got to put in the
[27:05] john the baptist and all the major
[27:07] prophets that come down
[27:08] because he i will put image where is
[27:10] that eye that eye is god himself
[27:12] that eye is god himself that worked
[27:14] through and we'll read later on today
[27:17] about ezekiel son of man prophesy
[27:21] son of man prophesy
[27:23] and if you'll watch and read your bible
[27:26] look in ezekiel
[27:28] sometimes it'll say son of man prophesy
[27:31] now i know that the the s is in the
[27:33] first of the sentence but if you'll look
[27:35] in a few places you'll look over in the
[27:38] in the sentence
[27:39] and the s will be a capital s right
[27:41] where it shouldn't be well that's the
[27:43] son of man talking
[27:45] then you see the little s which is god
[27:47] talking to ezekiel
[27:49] he's you'll we'll see in just a minute
[27:51] maybe we'll bring that out it's really
[27:52] it's really beautiful to watch you say
[27:54] well how in the world that bob was
[27:56] covering it today
[27:58] the lord
[27:59] said unto my lord
[28:01] capital l was talking to the little l
[28:03] what the capital l is always hey when
[28:05] you get when god starts talking to you
[28:07] by the baptism of the holy ghost it's
[28:09] the big l talking to the little l amen
[28:13] i thought that was just one
[28:16] position
[28:17] now it's a position
[28:19] because see brother louise doesn't have
[28:20] all the holy ghost
[28:22] because you've got the holy ghost and
[28:23] you've got the holy ghost jesus christ
[28:25] had all the holy ghost god is the holy
[28:27] ghost all right
[28:29] so we bring this out because this to me
[28:31] it's like i said before it puts
[28:34] everything in perspective that we have
[28:36] got to come to a woman see this was
[28:38] spoken before isaiah said a virgin shall
[28:41] conceive
[28:42] but he was a he was he put enmity or
[28:44] division
[28:45] and that's what we're going to talk
[28:46] about a little bit um because there was
[28:49] a little bit
[28:50] of um
[28:51] i felt a little pushback
[28:53] when i we were talking about
[28:56] uh that they had just a little bit of
[28:57] light during the church ages so we'll
[28:59] talk about that i kind of want to go
[29:01] through that a little bit more
[29:02] um sometimes you feel you feel like man
[29:05] it's all good and the water just flows
[29:07] really good and then all of a sudden
[29:09] something dams it up
[29:11] so this morning i kind of felt that
[29:13] maybe there was a little bit something i
[29:14] need to cover again so we'll go back and
[29:16] cover that all right
[29:18] listen
[29:19] not belittling anyone god didn't
[29:21] belittle
[29:23] anybody when he said i'm going to put
[29:24] enmity between them and what he's given
[29:26] you he's telling you the whole story
[29:28] remember what brother brown said the
[29:29] acts of a play he's acting out what he's
[29:31] going to do this great eternal plan of
[29:34] redemption has got to include
[29:37] if it's redemption that means we have to
[29:39] fall
[29:41] pretty simple we had to fall if there
[29:43] was redemption so in that there is a
[29:45] fall that we've already fell but god
[29:47] said in other words i'm going to put a
[29:49] division but i'm going to put it back
[29:51] together by this her seed
[29:55] which is christ amen
[30:00] woman
[30:02] i wrote myself a note
[30:04] woman to flesh
[30:06] because flesh has got to come back flesh
[30:08] is how they fell
[30:10] adam and eve did not fall in their soul
[30:13] they fell in their flesh their their
[30:15] spiritual being memory reason conscious
[30:18] affection and then their body just took
[30:20] over and did what the spirit told us to
[30:22] do amen and that what happens to us
[30:24] don't when we repent when we repent
[30:27] listen when we repent as as christians
[30:31] your soul doesn't repent
[30:35] your soul is god
[30:38] your spirit is what's repenting
[30:40] you're repenting for the memory reason
[30:42] conscious effects of imagination
[30:44] but if you're born again how can you
[30:46] repent if you repent that means your
[30:48] soul sinned and i thought your soul
[30:51] can't sin
[30:52] by the baptism of the holy ghost your
[30:53] soul cannot sin that's why you can't be
[30:56] judged when you're born again you can't
[30:57] be judged you're already judged
[30:59] amen what a wonderful picture
[31:02] so the woman is going to bring forth a
[31:04] child it's going to be a flesh person
[31:06] and it shall bruise thy head so it's
[31:08] talking about a body and thou shalt
[31:10] bruise his heel all right
[31:12] so the speaking of a promised son
[31:15] even before a virgin shall conceive god
[31:17] said i'm going to have to come down in
[31:18] human flesh and fix this thing because
[31:22] you take it all through types ruth boaz
[31:25] it had to be flesh
[31:28] can right can folk had to be flesh for
[31:30] the redemption to happen ruth had to be
[31:32] or boaz had to be kind to naomi and then
[31:35] ruth came under that being me and you as
[31:37] a gentile we've been through that a long
[31:39] time so deuteronomy 18 15
[31:42] lord thy god will raise up to be a
[31:44] prophet from the midst of thee this is
[31:45] talking about the son of man again
[31:48] like unto me unto him you shall hearken
[31:50] so there's
[31:51] moses telling us that god is going to
[31:54] have to come down in human flesh
[31:56] as a prophet not a prophet but the
[31:59] prophet amen
[32:01] because brother branham even tells us
[32:02] that who was the prophet of the end time
[32:04] he said the lord jesus christ is the
[32:05] prophet of the end time amen he he used
[32:08] william branham's voice many many
[32:10] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[32:12] time but william mary and brethren can't
[32:14] heal you
[32:16] he can't even give you a revelation only
[32:18] god can give you a revelation
[32:20] but he used a vessel that we
[32:23] giving signs and wonders that we can
[32:25] look and see all the different signs in
[32:27] his life and we can see that god had to
[32:29] work through that man i don't see how
[32:31] people can't see that god didn't work
[32:32] through that man and they call him a
[32:34] deceiver and everything else but listen
[32:37] they called god almighty a deceiver
[32:40] when jesus was on earth they called him
[32:42] everything in the world beelzebub
[32:44] deceiver and all these other things
[32:46] because he didn't come the normal way
[32:49] brother branham didn't come the normal
[32:51] way
[32:52] you know it's okay to quote moody and
[32:55] calvin and sankey and the different ones
[32:57] you know they'll they're they're people
[32:58] are pretty calm when you quote them or
[33:00] james dobson or
[33:02] or uh or jensen franklin they see how
[33:05] calm this is
[33:07] they go oh yeah okay that's just uh max
[33:10] lucado and you got all these good guys
[33:13] then you say brother branham said and
[33:14] they go what
[33:17] who is this man
[33:19] what's he telling me what to do you know
[33:20] why because he wasn't anyone now he went
[33:22] into normal
[33:23] he was he came here to what to give us
[33:26] the true word of god
[33:27] all the others are okay but he came for
[33:30] god to speak through him and he yielded
[33:32] himself we were talking about downstairs
[33:33] sister cleta was actually in that
[33:35] meeting i was talking about where they
[33:37] divided up the
[33:39] auditorium when he preached marriage in
[33:41] divorce and who is this melchizedek the
[33:44] night after that so all right let's go
[33:46] to matthew 16 and let's read
[33:48] real quick
[33:50] when jesus came to the coast of caesarea
[33:52] philippi he asked his disciples saying
[33:54] whom do men say that i the son of man i
[33:56] am this is where you i get all this
[33:58] everything is
[34:00] built around this because
[34:04] look what they said i'm going to try to
[34:06] word this right some say thou art john
[34:08] the baptist some say this in other words
[34:12] you know if you've got brother branham
[34:14] or samuel dale
[34:16] or whoever that's a a pillar of the of
[34:19] the the you know donnie reagan the
[34:20] different ones and he asked a question
[34:23] and they said well some of you say you
[34:25] got this doctrine and somebody said you
[34:27] got this and then you follow this guy
[34:28] and you follow this person
[34:30] and he stops he says no who do you say i
[34:33] am
[34:35] who do you say that's what god's asking
[34:37] you today are you following john the
[34:39] baptist
[34:41] i hope not
[34:43] john the baptist introduced christ
[34:46] he's not in the laodicean church age
[34:50] amen who you follow
[34:52] james dobson well james dobson is not a
[34:54] prophet he might be a good guy and he
[34:55] does have some good things to say but
[34:57] he's not somebody that can divide the
[34:59] word
[35:00] because all those people i uh that i
[35:03] mentioned they were all trinitarians
[35:04] they all believed in you know
[35:06] denominations so
[35:08] that's why i said what brother brown
[35:09] said you got to start thinking a new way
[35:13] even when you come to the lord in this
[35:16] message by the baptism of the holy ghost
[35:18] the son of god revelation it is a
[35:20] different revelation than what they get
[35:22] out there
[35:23] amen
[35:25] but then we got to take that and go
[35:27] further than that because nobody teaches
[35:30] i don't say nobody in the message i'm
[35:31] just saying you don't hear this in
[35:33] denominations they really all they do
[35:35] with the statue of perfect manners is
[35:36] you ain't perfect now ain't perfect
[35:42] talk to them every once in a while and
[35:43] you nail it down first thing they say i
[35:45] ain't perfect and you ain't perfect
[35:47] you don't need to be cutting your hair
[35:48] and wearing shorts and you know you
[35:50] start listing off the things you
[35:51] shouldn't do there well you ain't
[35:53] perfect i ain't perfect you know what
[35:54] they're telling you
[35:56] i ain't perfect so i can continue to do
[35:58] that and god's going to allow me to do
[35:59] that
[36:00] that ain't happening
[36:02] that's not my revelation that's not your
[36:04] revelation that may be their revelation
[36:07] but it's not our revelation and that
[36:09] revelation will not take you to the son
[36:11] of man revelation
[36:12] amen we're trying to get this is the
[36:14] vehicle that's going to take us from the
[36:16] son of god revelation to the son of man
[36:18] revelation
[36:19] you got to have the son of god first
[36:22] you got to have the baptism of the holy
[36:24] ghost seek it every day of your life
[36:28] i was up late late last night and that
[36:30] was one of the things i said god don't
[36:31] let me be that person that comes to you
[36:33] and says have i not
[36:35] cast out devils
[36:37] preach the gospel
[36:40] and he said depart from me i never knew
[36:41] you
[36:43] what a horrible thing that you've spent
[36:44] a lot of people have spent most of their
[36:46] lives trying to do that and they've been
[36:48] deceived right amen
[36:50] don't god don't let me be the savior
[36:53] amen
[36:55] god don't let me be deceived
[36:58] so he saith unto them but who say ye
[37:00] that i am i'm asking you today that's
[37:02] our question
[37:04] who is thou i am
[37:06] he says but whom say ye that i am
[37:10] and simon peter said thou art the christ
[37:13] the son of the living god
[37:16] basically he was saying you're the
[37:17] creator
[37:19] you're the son of god your god made
[37:21] manifest down here on earth and that's
[37:23] what's inside of you but i cannot
[37:25] understand how that all goes together
[37:27] that's pretty much what he was saying
[37:29] because if he'd have known and put it
[37:30] together he'd never run away from jesus
[37:32] at the at the cross he'd knew when jesus
[37:35] said because look at all the times and
[37:37] we'll get into it because i was reading
[37:38] it yesterday before yesterday in the
[37:40] gospels
[37:41] he told them he said i'm going to die
[37:45] i'm going to give my life in the hands
[37:48] of these people i'm going to be in the
[37:51] grave for three days the third day i'm
[37:53] going to raise from the dead he laid the
[37:54] plan out for him and they didn't believe
[37:57] one word he said
[38:00] not one
[38:01] destroy this temple i'll raise them in
[38:03] three days oh he's gonna knock that
[38:05] temple down that temple was probably as
[38:07] big as the taj mahal
[38:09] and he said he gonna knock that thing
[38:11] down and build it back in three days
[38:13] they never understood
[38:15] what a depressing thing maybe that jesus
[38:17] i wonder why he said sometimes maybe in
[38:20] and and and thought
[38:22] i'm lonely nobody knows
[38:25] it's like brother branham in the sixth
[38:27] cell he's standing there at the pulpit
[38:29] as lonely as can be
[38:31] when he said it's gone from you it's not
[38:33] for you
[38:34] go on and live a simple christian life
[38:36] in other words you're not gonna get what
[38:38] i'm saying
[38:40] but it won't return void
[38:42] somebody's gonna get it so jesus was
[38:45] there and jesus why swine john 17 he
[38:47] prayed for me and you
[38:49] even though we were still locked up
[38:50] inside of him and we had no genealogy
[38:53] out here in the world 2 000 years ago
[38:56] right
[38:58] he was praying for me and you when we
[39:00] got here
[39:01] amen
[39:03] thou art the christ the son of the
[39:04] living god i was going to be short today
[39:06] but i don't think so i don't think i
[39:07] decided not to be
[39:09] and jesus answered blessed art thou
[39:11] simon barjona where flesh and blood have
[39:13] not revealed it unto thee but my father
[39:16] which is in heaven
[39:18] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[39:19] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[39:21] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[39:22] against it i give you the keys of the
[39:24] kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou bind
[39:26] on earth shall be bound in heaven
[39:27] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[39:29] shall be loosed in heaven you see that
[39:30] you look at that and you see
[39:33] peter didn't understand what he had till
[39:35] the day of pentecost
[39:38] or he could have turned that key
[39:40] several times in his life but he didn't
[39:44] he didn't have it
[39:45] he was giving him the keys but it wasn't
[39:48] right then it was potentially he said
[39:50] but i know jesus was going now peter
[39:52] when you get the holy ghost
[39:54] you're not you're going to know where
[39:55] that key is at and you're going to know
[39:57] how to use it
[39:58] right now you're not going to know
[40:00] because all peter wanted to do was fight
[40:01] people and cut their ears off and and
[40:04] stab somebody you know he wanted lord
[40:06] you will never deny you yeah right yeah
[40:09] right peter yeah
[40:11] he said but i prayed for you peter
[40:14] he said i saw satan sift you like sand
[40:17] he said but i prayed for you
[40:19] now don't you think john 17 he did the
[40:21] same thing for me and you he prayed for
[40:23] us that we would make it
[40:25] and we're going to make it he prayed for
[40:28] us that we're going to make it
[40:30] and we are going to make it
[40:32] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[40:34] so 2 000 years he built his church on
[40:36] revelation of the son of man tell them
[40:37] god and the gates of hell shall not
[40:39] prevail against it and i will give thee
[40:41] the keys of the kingdom now we read that
[40:42] number one on thirst
[40:46] the prophet of god tells us to know him
[40:47] as life the person christ himself not
[40:49] comparing it's a revelation that god
[40:51] built his church upon
[40:52] and if we don't build upon that same
[40:54] church the bible says abel by faith and
[40:56] faith is a divine revelation
[40:59] see faith is a divine revelation all
[41:01] right
[41:02] you know brother brown said one time he
[41:03] said what did they say brother brown
[41:04] what is the new birth he said it's a
[41:06] personal revelation of jesus christ
[41:09] personally to you so that's what this is
[41:10] right here it's the person faith is the
[41:12] divine revelation this whole thing is
[41:14] built on the revelation then and unless
[41:17] it's revealed to you jesus said i thank
[41:19] the father that now has hid these things
[41:21] from the wise or the view of the wise of
[41:23] this world
[41:24] and revealed it to babe such as we'll
[41:26] learn see the whole thing is built
[41:28] you've got to know
[41:30] the person and who is that person the
[41:32] son of man now you got to know the son
[41:34] of god we know that but you got to move
[41:36] it up now this is the one i want to stop
[41:38] don't get much further that's okay it's
[41:40] just kind of background but i wanted to
[41:41] get to ezekiel
[41:42] but let's go to number two
[41:45] what visions are and this is where
[41:46] brother brown's talking now what's he
[41:48] doing
[41:49] he's telling us
[41:51] this is in 1956
[41:53] he hasn't had the seals revealed to him
[41:55] yet
[41:56] he knows maybe that something's coming
[41:58] he know
[41:59] as a prophet he sees things going to
[42:02] transpire he knows though that his
[42:05] you think you take all the quotes from
[42:07] brother brown said not in the years of
[42:09] preparation
[42:10] or not when he starts his message
[42:12] somebody's self
[42:14] not in the healing campaign i believe
[42:16] it's in choosing of a bride he said but
[42:18] when he
[42:19] comes to start his message
[42:23] so this is what he's talking about here
[42:25] now watch
[42:26] now when the holy spirit fell on the
[42:28] church it was an eastern people in
[42:29] jerusalem
[42:30] that's where the holy ghost fell and
[42:32] great signs and wonders was done by the
[42:33] church in the early pentecostal age of
[42:35] the early church
[42:36] then the next round of apostles
[42:39] then came into catholic church then 1500
[42:41] years then the lutherans then from all
[42:43] that down it's been a day where the
[42:45] light went out
[42:46] and it's been a daylight enough
[42:48] that you could see that jesus was the
[42:50] son of god and you should repent but the
[42:52] real bright light of the holy ghost has
[42:54] never shined through these ages now stop
[42:56] right there i was trying to
[42:58] this is the only thing i can come up
[43:00] with that'll help us
[43:02] is
[43:02] number one in the early church ages the
[43:04] bible was not written
[43:07] the bible's not written until the age of
[43:09] man which is lutheran and wesley right
[43:12] so all they had was the resources they
[43:14] had was maybe somebody wrote something
[43:16] down maybe somebody listen
[43:19] if you went and heard somebody preach
[43:21] like paul or peter you just had to get
[43:23] it by wrote recall you had to bring it
[43:25] up in your brain you couldn't say well
[43:26] now if you'll go over there and listen
[43:27] to that tape
[43:29] see how we yeah now what'd he say
[43:32] because remember paul was so
[43:34] misunderstood there was a group that was
[43:35] preaching that paul was preaching that
[43:37] the resurrection had already happened
[43:39] right phillips and harmonious i believe
[43:41] it was and they tried to get him to stop
[43:43] and they wouldn't stop and you know the
[43:44] lord did what he did but
[43:46] it's because they didn't have resources
[43:49] but see god knew that that's the plan of
[43:51] god because here's the program the
[43:54] program is the same holy ghost but
[43:56] remember there's four characteristics of
[43:58] the holy ghost
[43:59] the lion
[44:01] the ox
[44:02] the man and the eagle and see that's in
[44:04] ezekiel so that sets the pattern that
[44:06] you couldn't have a man age in the first
[44:10] church age
[44:12] it's not rick it's not required
[44:14] it was the boldness of a line speak the
[44:16] word of god do the things of god
[44:20] be like cyrenthius uh strength it was
[44:22] the strength yeah in the bath house
[44:24] saying i'm not gonna have anything to do
[44:26] with or the iranians say i'm not gonna
[44:28] have anything to do with ceremonies
[44:29] because syrenthia said that jesus wasn't
[44:30] god
[44:32] right so the boldness of a lion
[44:35] the bible was not even written the
[44:36] resources were not there but the line
[44:38] then you had the ox he said the 1500
[44:41] years of
[44:42] of
[44:43] well that's tribulation the catholic
[44:44] church what they do
[44:46] they just shut the light off
[44:49] they said you don't believe in me if we
[44:51] had the if we had the church ages up
[44:53] here remember that fourth church age is
[44:55] about the same as our church age just a
[44:57] little bit of life amen
[44:59] because of 1500 years of dark ages and
[45:02] they didn't have they didn't have enough
[45:03] word i mean even even columba was a
[45:06] messenger of that age and he died before
[45:07] the age started
[45:09] so it had to be what the preachers
[45:11] preached
[45:13] do you understand you see how difficult
[45:15] listen it's difficult for y'all to even
[45:17] to listen to a sermon
[45:18] and you can press play anytime you want
[45:20] to
[45:22] hard for us to read a book we got them
[45:24] right here in front of us
[45:27] sometimes it's hard for us to read the
[45:28] bible and there's bibles on every
[45:30] bookshelf
[45:36] but for them it just wasn't there there
[45:37] was no resources but you know what god
[45:40] honored it because god said that's my
[45:41] people
[45:43] they are under the messenger of their
[45:45] hour and they're doing what he said
[45:47] the best of their ability
[45:49] so now watch brother branham saying then
[45:51] from then on down it's been a day where
[45:53] the light went out and it's been a
[45:55] daylight enough
[45:57] that you could see that jesus was the
[45:59] son of god you should repent but the
[46:01] real bright light of the holy ghost has
[46:03] never shined through these ages
[46:05] certainly the bible said it wouldn't as
[46:08] the prophet said it wouldn't just as
[46:10] sure as he said they couldn't believe
[46:11] because isaiah said there hasn't been
[46:13] light because the prophet said
[46:15] there's been enough light to know that
[46:18] you ought to do right and wrong
[46:22] there's been enough light to know that
[46:24] you believed on the resurrection of the
[46:26] lord jesus accept him as your personal
[46:28] savior put your name on the church book
[46:30] and live the good life all right i read
[46:32] that this morning that that's that's the
[46:34] son of god revelation that's what god
[46:36] said jesus said look i'm gonna make it
[46:37] real simple
[46:38] this is how i'm gonna build my church
[46:41] now i'm going to have a group of people
[46:42] that i'm going to build on more because
[46:44] remember zerubbabel had to come and
[46:46] clean everything off and build a pyramid
[46:51] amen
[46:52] he had to clean that off to build a
[46:53] pyramid which the pyramid is the stature
[46:56] of a perfect man
[46:59] they didn't have the statue of a perfect
[47:00] man back then like i said the bible
[47:02] wasn't written till the 1500s
[47:04] somewhere in there
[47:06] so they didn't have a they didn't have a
[47:08] bible to read they didn't read what
[47:09] peter wrote maybe somebody got a hold of
[47:11] the bible and would read it
[47:13] but it was second-hand information they
[47:15] could change it i wonder why all the you
[47:17] know you wonder the the catholic church
[47:19] why they were so powerful there was
[47:21] nothing for them they held the latin
[47:23] vulgate they held everything that was
[47:25] that was of history
[47:27] so they just said now we don't need to
[47:28] do it you just listen to what the priest
[47:29] said
[47:30] yeah we're going to have a father son
[47:32] holy ghost baptism yeah i know they i
[47:34] know they didn't baptize that way in the
[47:36] early church but we're going to do it
[47:37] this way now see there was nothing to
[47:39] combat that and god had to literally
[47:41] wink at their ignorance
[47:44] he had to wink because there's a lot of
[47:45] people even luther was a trinitarian
[47:47] wesley was trinitarian
[47:50] the first church the pentecostal church
[47:51] of 1906's through the street they were
[47:53] trinitarians but god winked at their
[47:55] ignorance look knowing that somebody was
[47:57] coming
[47:59] amen
[48:00] that's us
[48:02] that would know the full word of god
[48:04] that would not be just a small light it
[48:07] would be a full manifestation of the
[48:08] holy ghost
[48:10] you say well i don't know i just i just
[48:12] like being a child of god well that's
[48:14] okay
[48:17] that's all right that's what you want to
[48:18] be you can stop yourself anytime you
[48:20] want to
[48:21] because you're a free mortal agent and
[48:22] you can do it but you know what
[48:25] i don't want to taste death
[48:27] i may have to but i sure don't want to
[48:30] because god promised me there was
[48:31] somebody that wouldn't
[48:33] boy what a but listen what a great thing
[48:36] you say well that ought to make you feel
[48:38] good well no it ought to make you real
[48:39] humble
[48:41] that god could bring you something
[48:43] that as we were singing about the saints
[48:46] you realize they're waiting on you and
[48:48] me a group of people that's going to see
[48:52] the son of man revelation and it's going
[48:54] to be so strong it's going to be like
[48:58] lazarus come forth
[49:02] but we're not going to just call one
[49:03] person now
[49:04] it's going to be a whole seven church
[49:07] ages are going to be called out of the
[49:09] ground
[49:10] and you know what it's not going to take
[49:11] a lot of effort it's just going to be in
[49:13] it to right being at the right place in
[49:14] the right position
[49:16] and listen having the resources
[49:19] we have the resources now to study more
[49:22] than anybody's ever studied before we
[49:24] can take words and run them all the way
[49:25] back into the wherever
[49:27] they didn't have that that's right we
[49:29] have that now
[49:31] where we can study as ministers and you
[49:33] can study as laity and we can put these
[49:34] things together and the holy ghost can
[49:36] really work
[49:38] i i believe brother brown said
[49:41] you know you wait
[49:43] he said this is just in part
[49:47] brother branham was just in part
[49:50] because it was one man
[49:52] but when you get a worldwide church full
[49:54] of people now look it's not going to be
[49:56] billions
[49:57] it's probably not even going to be
[49:58] millions
[50:00] but it's going to be a small group
[50:02] that's going to be connected together by
[50:04] the holy ghost
[50:06] not by the internet but by the holy
[50:08] coast we're going to be connected
[50:09] together and we're going to bring the
[50:10] dead saints out of the ground
[50:12] i just believe that 100 because that's
[50:14] what the bible said
[50:16] it's the same holy ghost but they didn't
[50:17] have much to work in back then so
[50:21] not belittling those people
[50:24] because you got to include paul and paul
[50:26] wrote 80 of the new testament so you
[50:27] can't belittle those people
[50:30] but they had their time i i was thinking
[50:32] in there
[50:33] a few minutes ago that's why the bible
[50:35] says the last
[50:36] will be first
[50:38] and the first
[50:40] will be last why we got more revelation
[50:43] than they do
[50:44] the last church age the last church aged
[50:47] messenger the last bride has got more
[50:50] revelation
[50:51] than the first church age
[50:53] so the last
[50:54] us
[50:55] will come up first
[50:57] then the first is going to come up last
[51:00] that's just the way that's the way the
[51:01] bible says it
[51:03] amen
[51:05] now we can skip over let's go to the
[51:07] next one says son of god is who we know
[51:09] he's the creator he's the one that steps
[51:12] out and says let there be he's the one
[51:13] that started all this amen
[51:16] and as he started it he's going to
[51:17] finish it
[51:19] he couldn't be the son of man back then
[51:20] because like i said before
[51:22] eve's womb was already polluted her
[51:24] brain womb up here was already polluted
[51:26] and then her natural wound got polluted
[51:29] and god said i'll not dwell in an
[51:30] unclean vessel i'm not gonna come
[51:32] through something unclean
[51:34] but i'll put enmity and then a virgin
[51:38] shall conceive and i'm going to come in
[51:40] i'm going to come away where nobody has
[51:42] ever come this way before
[51:43] nobody
[51:45] nobody's ever been born like this
[51:48] and that's the way i'm going to be born
[51:49] because i'm going to clean that womb out
[51:51] i'm going to clean the womb i'm going to
[51:52] clean the people up i'm going to come
[51:54] back i'm going to come into the people
[51:55] i'm going to keep them clean and i'm
[51:56] going to come back again in the end time
[51:58] and i'm going to really clean them up
[52:00] i'm going to clean the body up
[52:03] which to me is totally
[52:06] a miracle
[52:08] as much as we the flesh gets beaten
[52:13] listen
[52:14] i'mma live in this flesh for an
[52:16] eternity not like you see it but i'm
[52:19] going to live in this flesh i'm so
[52:20] connected to god he was so connected to
[52:22] me he put mom and dad together and
[52:25] brought the right flesh here for my soul
[52:27] to fit in
[52:29] amen
[52:31] he did that
[52:32] brother bryan said he didn't what he he
[52:34] bred this one to this one this one to
[52:36] this one how many stories did you hear
[52:39] of how y'all got together or how your
[52:41] mama got together or how your daddy was
[52:43] in the war and everybody got killed but
[52:44] him why
[52:46] if you're predestinated
[52:50] it's because of you
[52:53] you're the one that kept them from dying
[52:54] because if they die you're done
[52:57] that's what i told them we were in
[52:58] virginia i was preaching for brother um
[53:01] ron spencer and i told him i said you
[53:02] know the civil war up here happened a
[53:04] lot i said there were 600 000 men got
[53:07] killed in the civil war now that was
[53:09] during the whole part of the war six
[53:10] hundred thousand men so that's six
[53:12] hundred thousand generations
[53:14] because when you die you don't unless
[53:16] they had already had children or started
[53:18] having children a lot of them are really
[53:19] young
[53:20] i said do you know you living here in
[53:22] virginia i said you know it's a miracle
[53:23] you got here
[53:25] because most of those people died were
[53:27] from virginia and different places like
[53:28] that i said it was a miracle how that
[53:30] your daddy made it through the civil war
[53:33] and then here come you
[53:34] why it was god
[53:36] it was those angels flicking the bullets
[53:39] out of the way or turning you in a
[53:41] direction to where that you can't be
[53:43] harmed
[53:44] thank god
[53:47] that he thought enough of you to do that
[53:50] he thought enough to get your flesh here
[53:52] he already had your soul
[53:54] and knew what you were gonna do
[53:57] and he brought you down here in human
[53:58] flesh
[54:00] that's why i love that genesis 1 26 man
[54:02] it didn't stay in spirit form it was put
[54:05] in flesh
[54:07] god was happy when he put it in flesh he
[54:09] knew they were going to fall but he was
[54:11] still happy
[54:13] and he was happy when you came born in
[54:16] sin shaping in iniquity spousal your
[54:18] mother's womb a liar doomed it on your
[54:20] way to hell
[54:22] god said
[54:24] hang on devil just give him a minute
[54:27] just give him a few years
[54:29] don't worry you you can give him all
[54:31] kind of trouble but he's just like job
[54:33] he said but you can't touch your soul
[54:35] you can't kill him you can give him all
[54:37] kind of problems you want to
[54:38] but you just don't touch his soul he
[54:40] said because that one's mine
[54:43] and he's got to come or she's got to
[54:44] come to this place right here now devil
[54:46] you don't know it because you're not in
[54:47] my mind
[54:49] but he said okay you can you can do what
[54:51] you need to do but you just you can't
[54:52] take their life
[54:54] you see how much god is working to get
[54:57] you here
[54:58] this may not be part of the sermon but
[55:00] this is part of the son of man if we're
[55:01] gonna be the part of the son of man to
[55:02] play
[55:03] we gotta be alive we gotta be here
[55:08] and we gotta believe who we are
[55:11] so after the fall let's skip on through
[55:13] we know about genesis 1 26.
[55:17] let's go to genesis 6 verse 8 after the
[55:19] fall there was no way for man to
[55:21] fellowship with god
[55:25] this is what was
[55:26] formed was genesis 1 26 then he put to
[55:28] 126 and the 2 7 man
[55:31] and was supposed to start bringing
[55:32] children by the spoken word of god we
[55:34] know that didn't happen all right so
[55:36] keep going to the next one genesis 3 15
[55:38] then genesis 6 verse 8. so after the
[55:41] fall there was no way for man to
[55:43] fellowship with god the way he wanted
[55:45] them to fellowship i picked up my
[55:47] favorite book two nights ago
[55:49] oneness with god 1962 february read it
[55:53] boy i'm telling you
[55:55] he said there was god
[55:57] and adam and eve
[55:59] in the garden
[56:01] talking he said true oneness
[56:04] now that's three people
[56:07] that's three people he said true
[56:10] oneness
[56:11] was god talking to adam and eve
[56:14] in the cool of the day that's true
[56:16] oneness because listen true oneness is
[56:18] is all of us millions that's going to be
[56:20] living in that new city
[56:22] that's true oneness listen when the
[56:24] world that lives outside that makes it
[56:27] by the skin of their teeth
[56:29] and they're living outside the city and
[56:30] they see all of us living inside the
[56:32] city
[56:33] they're gonna go those people
[56:36] are jesus christ made manifest in
[56:38] another form called the bride they're
[56:40] gonna know who you are
[56:42] they're gonna know and give you honor
[56:47] we made it
[56:49] but there was no way for man to
[56:50] fellowship with god
[56:52] so god had to allow the bulls and ghosts
[56:53] like brad was talking about today there
[56:55] had to be a holy of holies and there had
[56:57] to be a a a law given and there had to
[57:00] be this and there had to be that given
[57:03] all down to the church ages i mean well
[57:05] church ages in the old testament
[57:07] the bible says noah found grace in the
[57:09] eyes of the lord so luke 17 verse 26
[57:12] says as it was in the days of noah
[57:14] because remember it says it was also in
[57:15] the days of the son of man
[57:18] not when the son of man is revealed but
[57:19] in the days of the son of man you have
[57:21] to get on down to where genesis 18 3.
[57:23] we're going to skip through this real
[57:24] quick genesis 18 3 he said my lord
[57:28] now i want to read you a quote
[57:31] they don't have it there
[57:32] it's off of who is this melchizedek
[57:35] y'all ought to read that one too how
[57:36] many times have i told you i want to
[57:37] read three or four songs whatever you
[57:39] need to re read a book read a book this
[57:41] week okay
[57:43] everybody gets the book of the month
[57:44] club and you start reading the book so
[57:46] hello
[57:49] your book of the month club is who is
[57:51] this milk is it read the book and
[57:53] oneness with god
[57:55] it's not publisher clearinghouse either
[57:57] aaron
[58:01] y'all have my own book club all right
[58:02] read this book
[58:03] but who is this melchizedek now look
[58:06] we're talking about now we've up to
[58:08] abraham real quick here now god in this
[58:10] stage
[58:11] it's this stage of his creation later
[58:13] formed in the flesh jesus let's talk
[58:15] about who's this melchizedek because
[58:17] remember melchizedek was not jesus
[58:19] christ the flesh
[58:22] melchizedek was not your savior in the
[58:24] form he was in when he he was only a
[58:27] prophet to prophesy to abraham to tell
[58:30] him according to the time of life but
[58:32] now remember he had to be almighty god
[58:34] because he had to change sarah's womb
[58:37] and change them back to young people now
[58:40] a normal human being can't do that
[58:43] it had to be god
[58:45] so from what from the great beginning
[58:47] spirit then came down to be well you
[58:49] don't oh you got hey good job
[58:52] from the great spirit beginning spirit
[58:54] then came down to be the word bringing
[58:56] itself out
[58:58] the word doesn't yet make itself it just
[59:01] spoke out in morphe later he becomes
[59:03] flesh jesus mortal to taste death for
[59:05] all of us sinners
[59:06] when abraham met him he was melchizedek
[59:09] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[59:12] what are me and you
[59:14] we're the attributes of god
[59:17] so he's talking to me and you
[59:19] all right when abraham met him he was
[59:21] melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[59:24] attributes will do in the final end
[59:27] every son of abraham
[59:29] every son of the faith will absolutely
[59:32] do the same thing then he starts talking
[59:34] about ruth and boaz but what is it what
[59:36] did they do they met god in human flesh
[59:41] and he changed their body
[59:45] and now what we're looking at we're
[59:46] looking to a body change
[59:48] all right so every son of the faith in
[59:51] the final end we'll do the same thing we
[59:53] got to come we got to be able to
[59:55] identify
[59:56] this lord
[59:59] not three but one
[1:00:03] see how important that is that brother
[1:00:04] brown brought the revelation of one god
[1:00:06] we wouldn't be able to fulfill that
[1:00:09] if we he didn't bring us back to the
[1:00:10] revelation of one true and living god
[1:00:12] amen because abraham is the father of
[1:00:15] our faith and we have faith in that
[1:00:17] there's one god
[1:00:20] i don't have faith that there's three
[1:00:21] i got faith that there's one god
[1:00:24] and listen he lives in your heart
[1:00:27] he's not he's not the third person of
[1:00:29] the trinity doesn't live in your soul
[1:00:32] father son holy ghost okay
[1:00:34] no
[1:00:35] no all three of them live in your soul
[1:00:38] amen the three manifestations of one god
[1:00:40] lives in your soul
[1:00:42] all right then my lord means of men i
[1:00:45] want to try to skip through all this
[1:00:46] because i want to get something here to
[1:00:47] end
[1:00:48] and remember that that was the the
[1:00:51] definition of lord is adonai
[1:00:54] which means of men are the title spoken
[1:00:57] in place of yahweh in jewish display of
[1:00:59] reverence that's why brother brown said
[1:01:00] when he called him lord he knew who he
[1:01:02] was
[1:01:03] same way with paul paul said lord
[1:01:06] he was doing the same thing he was
[1:01:08] calling him the same thing when he said
[1:01:10] lord all right so let's continue on
[1:01:13] genesis 18 verse 22
[1:01:16] and the men turned their face from them
[1:01:17] and went towards sodom we talked about
[1:01:19] that this morning but abraham stood yet
[1:01:21] before the lord so what happened billy
[1:01:23] graham and oral robbers went to the
[1:01:24] world
[1:01:26] and they blinded the eyes of the people
[1:01:28] brought some people in listen let me say
[1:01:31] one more time
[1:01:33] he didn't send billy graham and oral
[1:01:35] roberts just to blind people and and not
[1:01:37] get any fruit for their labor
[1:01:39] they're identified in the scripture
[1:01:43] as the two prophets that went to sodom
[1:01:45] i'm just telling you what brother brown
[1:01:47] said and he said they had the holy ghost
[1:01:49] well see why you say well and i've had
[1:01:51] people ask me said well why didn't they
[1:01:52] accept the message it wasn't theirs to
[1:01:54] accept
[1:01:55] they had their own message
[1:01:58] if they had a message
[1:02:01] and the prophet identified where they
[1:02:03] were going
[1:02:04] sure i believe billy graham and oral
[1:02:06] robbers there'll be people under their
[1:02:07] message that receives the holy ghost
[1:02:10] under their message
[1:02:12] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[1:02:13] thou shalt be saved all right everybody
[1:02:15] got that i'm just not i don't want to
[1:02:17] kick people out i'd rather put people in
[1:02:20] i don't i don't want to kick you know
[1:02:22] sodom and gomorrah didn't make it
[1:02:24] but at least three of them did
[1:02:26] i mean three people came out of sodom
[1:02:27] and gomorrah at least those three people
[1:02:29] come out and believe the message of
[1:02:31] their hour
[1:02:32] that was the lukewarm church the one we
[1:02:34] talked about this morning the center of
[1:02:35] the lukewarm church and the elect now
[1:02:37] the elect stayed right here
[1:02:39] the elect stayed with what the son of
[1:02:41] man revelation
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:46] because listen abraham didn't know that
[1:02:47] was god in human flesh
[1:02:50] if he called him my lord and he looked
[1:02:51] at him and fed him a calf and give him
[1:02:53] butter
[1:02:54] and give him let him sit down in the
[1:02:56] chair washed his feet
[1:02:58] he knew that was a man but he knew that
[1:03:00] god was in that man he might not
[1:03:01] understood totally but he knew my lord
[1:03:04] you've come to visit me
[1:03:08] have we had a visitation
[1:03:11] you got to have a visitation in your
[1:03:13] life you may not have to be on the
[1:03:14] plains of memory and you know may not
[1:03:16] have to be here and there but you need
[1:03:17] to have a visitation from god
[1:03:20] that you know that you know that back
[1:03:21] side of the desert experience that
[1:03:23] brother brown was talking about he said
[1:03:24] oh brother wait that's just for
[1:03:26] preachers i know i think it's for
[1:03:27] everybody
[1:03:29] i think it's for everybody we all ought
[1:03:30] to have a backside of the desert
[1:03:32] experience where we meet god and we
[1:03:34] won't see him in a burning bush we'll
[1:03:35] see him as a person a man because he is
[1:03:37] a person
[1:03:39] all right so genesis 19 verse 1
[1:03:41] the two angels go to sodom they bring
[1:03:44] lot out he says my lords
[1:03:47] but luke 17 28-30 is what brother
[1:03:50] branham always keys in on where it comes
[1:03:52] to lot where right before the
[1:03:54] destruction of the world or sodom this
[1:03:56] is what's got to happen likewise as it
[1:03:58] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:04:00] drank they bought they sold they know
[1:04:02] what's happening now
[1:04:03] they planted they build it
[1:04:05] it's not too you can't buy much now
[1:04:09] supply chains if y'all want anything for
[1:04:11] christmas you better buy it now
[1:04:15] there's several thousand boats sitting
[1:04:17] out there in the ocean with products on
[1:04:19] it that i talked to a guy this morning
[1:04:21] he ordered some bee equipment and be
[1:04:22] here in three to six months
[1:04:25] three to six months
[1:04:28] so
[1:04:29] i'm just saying we may have to pray a
[1:04:31] little bit before we get out of this
[1:04:32] place
[1:04:34] this may be our persecution coming where
[1:04:36] we can't find stuff
[1:04:37] amen and it's not stuff we want
[1:04:40] listen god ain't in your wants
[1:04:43] he's in your needs
[1:04:45] ain't in your wants amen
[1:04:48] let's just pray that all the equipment
[1:04:49] comes for this
[1:04:51] stuff richard roberts
[1:04:55] we're having a hard time getting you
[1:04:56] know we've already got the screens up
[1:04:58] here for our to put our we can get rid
[1:05:00] of this thing and we're going to put
[1:05:01] them right here and put all the songs on
[1:05:02] it but it's and they're
[1:05:04] they're undertaking i looked at that
[1:05:06] thing y'all were doing you and anderson
[1:05:08] good grief
[1:05:09] the schematics oh
[1:05:11] thank god y'all doing it
[1:05:14] if it was color coded i couldn't do it
[1:05:17] but pray for them that we'll get the
[1:05:18] equipment and we'll get them in here
[1:05:20] because they're gonna have to run all
[1:05:21] new wires all these cameras are outdated
[1:05:22] i didn't know if you knew that or not
[1:05:24] all these cameras now are outdated we're
[1:05:25] going to high definition
[1:05:28] something something something where we
[1:05:30] gotta have to make sure dad we're gonna
[1:05:31] have to make sure um hair's right
[1:05:35] everybody be able to see every hair on
[1:05:36] your head
[1:05:37] mine may be three or four but that's
[1:05:39] okay
[1:05:40] but listen remember that's what's
[1:05:42] happened
[1:05:43] in sodom before the destruction came but
[1:05:45] the same day that lot went out of sodom
[1:05:48] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:05:49] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:05:51] it be in the day when the son of man
[1:05:53] listen when the son of man is revealed
[1:05:55] it's going to be just a very short work
[1:05:56] and we're going to be out of here and
[1:05:58] god's going to rain down fire on sodom
[1:05:59] and gomorrah natural here on this earth
[1:06:03] amen i mean it's just going to be a real
[1:06:05] short time there's not going to be a
[1:06:06] church age or not going to be
[1:06:08] years no i believe it's going to happen
[1:06:10] boom boom boom and it may happen as soon
[1:06:12] as we get out of here
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] but even though shall it be in the day
[1:06:17] when the son of man look is revealed
[1:06:20] not just shows up
[1:06:22] but revealed
[1:06:24] we know who he is we know where he's at
[1:06:28] and we know why he's here
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:31] that's our that's our situation that we
[1:06:34] are not
[1:06:36] fully taking
[1:06:37] and saying well
[1:06:39] it's like the brother said this weekend
[1:06:40] well we know the son of man
[1:06:42] people was preached on the son of man
[1:06:44] and preached on the son of man we know
[1:06:45] that we're under the see people know
[1:06:47] that we're under the ministry of the son
[1:06:49] of man listen if you don't have the
[1:06:51] revelation of it you're not
[1:06:54] not trying to be mean
[1:06:56] but if you're not under that and you
[1:06:58] don't like he said i i couldn't i
[1:07:00] couldn't separate him and know why the
[1:07:01] sort of man had to come and so they just
[1:07:04] put him on a shelf
[1:07:06] i believe the message
[1:07:08] so i must believe it's not a man no
[1:07:11] no
[1:07:12] no revealed
[1:07:15] revealed
[1:07:17] it's got to be revealed it's something
[1:07:19] that's got to be made listen to reveal
[1:07:21] something is what you didn't know it to
[1:07:23] begin with
[1:07:25] what is a mystery
[1:07:27] something previously hidden
[1:07:29] amen and i believe revelation 10 7 says
[1:07:31] at the sounding of the seventh church
[1:07:33] age messenger when the mystery
[1:07:35] of god should be finished
[1:07:38] the whole message
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:42] let's look let's look at this
[1:07:44] we all know let's go to moses
[1:07:46] we didn't read this this morning exodus
[1:07:48] 33 now watch
[1:07:51] many times
[1:07:53] moses has said god i'd like to see you
[1:07:55] god i'd like to see you now the bible
[1:07:57] says that moses spoke
[1:07:59] lip to ear to god that means moses said
[1:08:03] i mean god said moses
[1:08:05] this is what i want you to do
[1:08:08] not from somebody else moses this is
[1:08:10] what i want you to do
[1:08:12] but he never seen him
[1:08:15] i'm fixing that right here
[1:08:17] and the lord said unto moses now look
[1:08:22] i will do this thing also that thou hast
[1:08:24] spoken
[1:08:26] moses was a prophet
[1:08:29] moses was a major prophet
[1:08:32] but he had to come to a position
[1:08:35] before god showed himself to him that's
[1:08:38] what i'm talking about me and you you
[1:08:40] can't just say i'm in the message you
[1:08:41] can't just say i've been i've got tenure
[1:08:45] i mean really
[1:08:47] i better miss you 35 years
[1:08:50] i know the book numbers and i know the
[1:08:52] and i know the colors of the book
[1:08:55] some of y'all don't even know the books
[1:08:57] how to color
[1:08:59] i pulled one out and read it the other
[1:09:01] day at um
[1:09:03] in kentucky it was uh
[1:09:06] what was it oh um the anointed ones at
[1:09:09] the end time and i believe it was like a
[1:09:10] gray book and somebody said what is that
[1:09:12] i said that's a message book you ought
[1:09:14] to read them sometime
[1:09:17] it was one of the older books that was
[1:09:18] by color so and the lord said unto moses
[1:09:21] i will do this thing that thou has
[1:09:23] spoken
[1:09:24] look
[1:09:26] with a condition
[1:09:29] for thou hast found grace in my sight
[1:09:34] been with him a long time
[1:09:36] and i know the
[1:09:38] by name now wait a minute
[1:09:40] he called moses
[1:09:43] 80 years ago
[1:09:48] this was the exodus
[1:09:50] he called him a you know he called him
[1:09:52] at least 40 years ago in the burning
[1:09:53] bush
[1:09:55] and i know thee by name moses had come
[1:09:57] to a position
[1:10:00] to where god could show himself to him
[1:10:01] that's the same ain't going to happen to
[1:10:02] me in you
[1:10:04] and he said i beseech thee show me thy
[1:10:06] glory that was moses
[1:10:08] and god said i will make all my goodness
[1:10:10] pass before thee and i will proclaim the
[1:10:12] name of the lord before thee and will be
[1:10:14] gracious to who i am be gracious and
[1:10:16] show mercy on whom i will show mercy
[1:10:20] but
[1:10:21] there was a condition
[1:10:23] because moses
[1:10:25] was not a son of god
[1:10:27] he didn't have the holy ghost
[1:10:29] he had an anointing
[1:10:31] but he didn't have the holy ghost in his
[1:10:32] soul
[1:10:34] and he said thou can't see my face why
[1:10:38] why
[1:10:40] he'd seen jesus christ
[1:10:42] but he wouldn't have known who he was
[1:10:45] he wouldn't have known who he was
[1:10:46] because he didn't have the new birth so
[1:10:47] god's not going to show you something
[1:10:48] and you not know who he is
[1:10:51] you understand what i'm saying
[1:10:53] there's a position god just didn't just
[1:10:54] say look now that you've been in the
[1:10:56] message for 15 minutes i'm going to show
[1:10:57] you everything
[1:10:59] 20 minutes
[1:11:01] i'm going to show you this everything
[1:11:02] i'm just going to lay it out here no
[1:11:03] he's not going to do that
[1:11:06] because listen god is very specific
[1:11:09] and you can't just be frivolous and you
[1:11:11] can't just say well like i said i've
[1:11:12] i've been sitting in this church for 40
[1:11:14] years i don't know what god is well you
[1:11:16] may not know no more about god than what
[1:11:18] brother brown said hot and taught knew
[1:11:19] about an egyptian knife whatever what is
[1:11:21] that
[1:11:22] do you remember google that
[1:11:25] neither have i i'm afraid to
[1:11:27] and he said thou canst not see my face
[1:11:29] for there shall no man see me and live
[1:11:32] now look when he became jesus christ
[1:11:35] everybody saw his face
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:39] when he was born on earth as the son of
[1:11:42] man which he wasn't at the time
[1:11:45] right he's developed
[1:11:47] he's now jehovah he's the great lord god
[1:11:50] almighty he's the great one that was in
[1:11:53] the burning bush he was a great one that
[1:11:54] came to joshua he was a great one that
[1:11:57] does these different things
[1:11:59] but he said for there shall no man see
[1:12:01] me and live
[1:12:04] and the lord said
[1:12:07] behold
[1:12:08] there's a place by me and thou shalt
[1:12:10] stand upon a rock
[1:12:13] because look
[1:12:23] son of man
[1:12:25] moses couldn't see the son of man
[1:12:27] he didn't have a revelation for the son
[1:12:28] of man
[1:12:31] see my face
[1:12:33] see my face
[1:12:34] because remember he saw what the back
[1:12:36] part of a man
[1:12:38] he didn't see his face he saw the back
[1:12:39] part
[1:12:40] the backside
[1:12:41] back here because his revelation
[1:12:43] couldn't show him the front
[1:12:45] but i thought the bible said me and you
[1:12:46] are to behold him face to face
[1:12:49] now what's the difference in moses and
[1:12:51] us we got the new birth
[1:12:53] we got a revelation we've come to a
[1:12:54] position
[1:12:56] but watch and thou canst not see my face
[1:12:58] for there shall no man see me and live
[1:13:01] and the lord said behold there is a
[1:13:03] place by man thou shalt stand upon a
[1:13:05] rock
[1:13:06] and it shall come to pass
[1:13:07] while my glory passed by which is his
[1:13:11] theophany
[1:13:13] that i will put then a cleft of the rock
[1:13:15] now that is not cleft
[1:13:17] c-l-e-f-t is c-l-i-f-t
[1:13:20] all right we'll get into that maybe
[1:13:21] later on i don't want to deal with it
[1:13:22] today
[1:13:23] because we we we
[1:13:25] sometimes we quote it wrong it's not
[1:13:27] cleft
[1:13:28] it's cleft
[1:13:30] it's two different words
[1:13:31] of the rock not a rock either the rock
[1:13:34] and will cover thee with my hand while i
[1:13:37] pass
[1:13:38] you see what god did in luther's age
[1:13:41] he covered luther's eyes
[1:13:44] to the revelation of one true living god
[1:13:47] he covered wesley's eyes
[1:13:50] to the father son holy ghost baptism and
[1:13:52] allowed them to do that because it
[1:13:53] wasn't time for them to see him face to
[1:13:55] face
[1:13:56] it wasn't time for people to see him
[1:13:58] like they did 2000 years ago
[1:14:01] partial revelation he covered up their
[1:14:03] eyes
[1:14:05] and i will cover thee with my hand while
[1:14:07] i pass by and i will take away my hand
[1:14:10] and thou shalt see the back part because
[1:14:12] remember he's got he walked by and moses
[1:14:14] looked and saw a man saw the back part
[1:14:17] of a man but my face
[1:14:19] shall not be seen
[1:14:20] that's a revelation of the son of man
[1:14:22] that's to my that's me
[1:14:24] that's me
[1:14:26] because face is personal
[1:14:29] you don't know that person
[1:14:32] unless you look at them in the face
[1:14:34] and when you look at them in the face
[1:14:36] you get a revelation
[1:14:38] of who that person is
[1:14:39] man woman old young
[1:14:42] pretty not so pretty
[1:14:44] but it's by the face
[1:14:46] so that's what i see and i when i looked
[1:14:48] i said man i wrote myself a question i
[1:14:50] said why why couldn't moses see his face
[1:14:53] it wasn't time for him to be revealed
[1:14:55] that way
[1:14:56] but now it's time for him to be revealed
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:01] now we don't we look through a glass
[1:15:03] darkly but now face to face
[1:15:06] all right let's go to
[1:15:09] let's skip on through to
[1:15:10] number four we know that he met joshua
[1:15:13] he met the captain of the host we talked
[1:15:15] about that this morning let's get to
[1:15:16] this one like we were
[1:15:18] this morning now look now notice he came
[1:15:20] first as a prophet
[1:15:22] they crucified him that's the son of man
[1:15:24] his own crucified him he came as the son
[1:15:26] of man then after the holy spirit came
[1:15:29] he was then the son of god god is a
[1:15:31] spirit he was the holy spirit son of god
[1:15:34] he lived through the church ages
[1:15:37] as the son of god
[1:15:39] now in the millennium he'll be son of
[1:15:40] david
[1:15:43] and real quick i want to throw this in
[1:15:44] for a couple of people that asked me a
[1:15:46] question about them why the millennium
[1:15:47] is not to us
[1:15:48] because it's not promised us
[1:15:51] gentiles are not promised a millennium
[1:15:54] bride is not promised a millennium
[1:15:56] because we're eternal a millennium is a
[1:15:58] thousand years
[1:16:00] we covered this you know several weeks
[1:16:01] ago in the
[1:16:03] in the eternal redemption so that's why
[1:16:05] the millennium
[1:16:06] is not to the bride we're there on a
[1:16:08] honeymoon we're just there like we're
[1:16:09] going to go and we've got reservations
[1:16:11] and we're going to go to this place for
[1:16:12] a thousand years
[1:16:13] because listen son of david has nothing
[1:16:15] to do with us remember the
[1:16:16] syrophoenician woman said thou son of
[1:16:18] david have mercy on me and said he
[1:16:20] didn't even pay her any attention
[1:16:22] you see what i mean about position
[1:16:24] there's position
[1:16:28] she said lord
[1:16:29] and he turned
[1:16:31] she said son of david brother brown said
[1:16:33] she had no possession in other words no
[1:16:36] nothing to deal with him she was a
[1:16:38] gentile
[1:16:40] and the son of david is to the jews
[1:16:42] thou son of david have mercy on me but
[1:16:44] now remember she was a gentile but now
[1:16:46] remember bartimaeus
[1:16:49] bartimaeus was a jew
[1:16:51] when he borrowed a mass when jesus
[1:16:53] walked by said thou son of david have
[1:16:55] mercy on me they said he turned
[1:16:58] and he said come here
[1:17:00] bring him here why because he was a jew
[1:17:02] so there you go the millennium is to the
[1:17:04] jews the millennium is not to the
[1:17:06] gentiles
[1:17:07] and that see to me that proves position
[1:17:10] i want you to start thinking about
[1:17:12] position it's not just that we got
[1:17:14] tenure that we've been in the message
[1:17:15] that we've heard brother now for 40
[1:17:16] years
[1:17:19] it does help a lot
[1:17:23] it helps a lot
[1:17:26] but it's not just because of that we're
[1:17:28] not doing these things just because of
[1:17:30] we're doing it because we reach a
[1:17:31] position
[1:17:32] moses reached a position to god said
[1:17:34] okay i'll let you see me now
[1:17:37] in other words you wouldn't understand
[1:17:38] what i was back then
[1:17:40] but you understand me now
[1:17:44] see that's what i'm praying for
[1:17:45] that i'll understand the present god
[1:17:49] i think i've got the god that was back
[1:17:50] there 2000 years ago the son of god that
[1:17:53] came back on the day of pentecost i've
[1:17:55] i've got him in my soul
[1:17:57] amen by the new birth
[1:17:59] but i want that son of man to come to me
[1:18:01] because now we can receive him because
[1:18:03] we're in the time of receiving where is
[1:18:06] to be revealed now how's the son of man
[1:18:08] going to be revealed
[1:18:12] he's got to be revealed in flesh
[1:18:14] and he can't be revealed in his own
[1:18:16] flesh he walked 2 000 years ago
[1:18:20] he's only can be revealed in your flesh
[1:18:22] in my flesh
[1:18:24] just like i said this morning
[1:18:26] in the flesh of the church of the living
[1:18:29] god not that church out there but in the
[1:18:31] flesh of the bride god is going to
[1:18:33] reveal himself
[1:18:36] just for a moment we saw it in william
[1:18:38] branham just for a moment but he said
[1:18:40] what you saw in part you'll see in its
[1:18:41] fullness
[1:18:43] what is the fullness when everybody
[1:18:45] or most people get a revelation of the
[1:18:48] son of man
[1:18:49] will be an invincible army
[1:18:51] now in the millennium he'll be son of
[1:18:52] david sitting on the throne of his
[1:18:54] father david because what was david
[1:18:56] david was a jew
[1:18:58] he is the son of david and then that's
[1:19:00] not now he's not now the son of david
[1:19:02] everybody understand that he is the son
[1:19:03] of david comma now he's going to make a
[1:19:05] point now
[1:19:07] now remember between the son of god in
[1:19:09] the layout of sin church age they put
[1:19:10] him out he's knocking at the door
[1:19:13] and in luke he said he would be revealed
[1:19:15] again as son of man the prophet
[1:19:18] fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures
[1:19:19] tie perfectly together it's on a man son
[1:19:22] of god son of david what is it it's the
[1:19:23] same god all the time just changing his
[1:19:25] form and morphing he changed it just a
[1:19:28] great drama to him he's acting it out
[1:19:30] now who's he acting it for he's not
[1:19:32] acting it for himself
[1:19:34] he's acting it out so we can see the
[1:19:36] steps of what we've got to do every son
[1:19:39] of the faith
[1:19:41] it's going to take this journey just
[1:19:43] like abraham did and what listen you say
[1:19:46] oh no that was right there when he met
[1:19:47] melchizedek no that was when he started
[1:19:49] back when god called him
[1:19:50] in genesis 14 15 16 justification
[1:19:53] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:56] come into circumcision come into body
[1:19:58] change
[1:20:00] come into producing the promised child
[1:20:04] amen he couldn't produce that promised
[1:20:05] child
[1:20:06] under son of god revelation
[1:20:09] it had to be under son of man revelation
[1:20:13] that's us folks
[1:20:17] i hope you see this
[1:20:18] number five
[1:20:21] proving his word this is one we read
[1:20:22] this morning let's just read the red
[1:20:23] part well i
[1:20:25] i got red in mine now remember let's see
[1:20:28] if we can find that
[1:20:30] one now remember there you go he came in
[1:20:33] three names son of man a prophet son of
[1:20:35] god the spirit son of david for the
[1:20:37] millennium but in between this
[1:20:39] conjunction now according to his own
[1:20:40] words in the days when the son of man
[1:20:42] shall be revealed luke 17 30 reveal
[1:20:45] himself as what not son of god so listen
[1:20:49] we should have the son of god revelation
[1:20:55] and have it right
[1:20:57] all the major doctrines no eternal hell
[1:20:59] father son holy ghost baptism is not
[1:21:01] true you understand what i mean
[1:21:04] everybody got that
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:09] will reveal himself in a different way
[1:21:15] i'm telling you what the prophet said
[1:21:17] now what does that make malachi 4
[1:21:19] exactly right so in other words you know
[1:21:20] what he was doing god was identifying if
[1:21:22] you're going to get anything from the
[1:21:23] son of man about the son of man you got
[1:21:25] to listen to malachi 4.
[1:21:29] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. you he's
[1:21:32] pointing us not to the man
[1:21:36] elijah behold i will send you elijah the
[1:21:38] prophet the prophet
[1:21:39] the spirit of elijah in a man called
[1:21:42] william branham but not the son of man a
[1:21:44] son of man
[1:21:45] revealing the son of man
[1:21:48] the son of man will reveal himself not
[1:21:50] in a whole big denomination as we've had
[1:21:52] through the ages but he would manifest
[1:21:54] himself as son of man again to make
[1:21:55] manifest malachi 4 and in that day i
[1:21:58] will send you elijah the prophet and he
[1:21:59] shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:22:00] back to the fathers faith of the
[1:22:02] apostolic fathers
[1:22:04] away from all this
[1:22:06] scroll up for me please
[1:22:09] denominationalism and come back to the
[1:22:10] original word again
[1:22:13] all right let's go to ezekiel
[1:22:16] 2 verse 1.
[1:22:18] we'll read this real quick we'll be done
[1:22:22] only been an hour
[1:22:25] now look
[1:22:26] and he said unto me
[1:22:28] son of man
[1:22:30] stand upon thy feet
[1:22:32] and i will speak unto thee
[1:22:35] and the spirit entered into me when he
[1:22:38] spake unto me
[1:22:42] so remember ezekiel's not a son of god
[1:22:44] the spirit had to enter him that spirit
[1:22:46] had to anoint him
[1:22:48] listen if the spirit enters you today
[1:22:51] be careful you got the new birth but you
[1:22:54] should have brought you should have
[1:22:55] brought him with you
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:57] many anointings but you know
[1:23:00] i mean many feelings so we're not
[1:23:02] talking about that ezekiel was not a son
[1:23:04] of god but he was look he showed him so
[1:23:06] much this capital s o n son of man stand
[1:23:08] up on my feet
[1:23:10] and set me up on my feet that i heard
[1:23:11] him that spake unto me and i want you to
[1:23:13] look at this
[1:23:15] real quick
[1:23:16] because there's a revelation in here i
[1:23:18] want you to get
[1:23:21] and he said unto me
[1:23:23] son of man
[1:23:24] i send thee to the children of israel
[1:23:26] now listen in type who are we
[1:23:29] in type where israel he's going to send
[1:23:32] ezekiel listen the person in ezekiel
[1:23:36] is going to be anointed to speak to
[1:23:40] israel common
[1:23:42] real israel
[1:23:44] at that time to prophesy
[1:23:46] should a man prophesied but remember it
[1:23:48] has a twofold meaning you and i
[1:23:52] by revelation
[1:23:54] are israel right
[1:23:56] all right
[1:23:58] and the spirit entered me no and he said
[1:24:00] unto me son of man i send thee to the
[1:24:01] children of israel to a rebellious
[1:24:04] nation that hath rebelled against me
[1:24:06] they and their fathers have transgressed
[1:24:07] against me even unto this very day
[1:24:12] now watch
[1:24:15] i'm going to go through this and i'll go
[1:24:16] through it again but watch how this goes
[1:24:18] even through our church ages
[1:24:23] rebellious generation
[1:24:25] transgressed against me even to this
[1:24:27] very day for they are impudent children
[1:24:30] and stiff-hearted
[1:24:32] i do send the unto them
[1:24:34] and thou shalt say unto them thus saith
[1:24:36] the lord god how many of these people
[1:24:38] said thus saith the lord paul irenaeus
[1:24:40] martin columba i know they all did
[1:24:42] brother rhyme said they had thus saith
[1:24:43] the lord
[1:24:44] all right
[1:24:45] and they whether they will hear or
[1:24:47] whether they will forebear for their
[1:24:49] rebellious house he said that twice
[1:24:52] yet shall know that there has been a
[1:24:54] prophet
[1:24:55] among them
[1:24:57] now do you know if you've had a prophet
[1:24:58] among you
[1:25:00] all right and thou son of man little ass
[1:25:03] so he's talking to ezekiel be not afraid
[1:25:05] of them
[1:25:07] need to be afraid of their words
[1:25:12] what did the angel tell brother branham
[1:25:15] that don't be afraid of anything
[1:25:17] you get the people to believe you not
[1:25:18] even cancer will stand you're standing
[1:25:20] in your way
[1:25:22] and thou son of man be not afraid of
[1:25:24] them remember that's little s that's not
[1:25:25] big ass that's a little s
[1:25:26] be not afraid of them neither be afraid
[1:25:28] of their words though briars and thorns
[1:25:30] be with thee and thou dost dwell among
[1:25:32] scorpions
[1:25:34] be not afraid of their words
[1:25:36] nor deep be dismayed at their looks it's
[1:25:38] pretty much he's he's coming to a place
[1:25:40] to where they're not going to be able to
[1:25:42] touch him because god's going to get the
[1:25:44] word out
[1:25:45] all right and thou shalt speak my words
[1:25:47] unto them
[1:25:49] whether they will hear or whether they
[1:25:50] will forebear for their most rebellious
[1:25:53] but thou son of man hear what i say unto
[1:25:55] thee be not thou rebellious like that
[1:25:58] rebellious house open thy mouth and eat
[1:26:01] what i give thee
[1:26:03] now we're fixing to go
[1:26:05] we're fixing to go to revelations 10 8.
[1:26:09] okay so we're going to tie these two
[1:26:11] together because what is revelations 10
[1:26:13] 8
[1:26:14] a flesh man
[1:26:18] john
[1:26:19] standing on patmos
[1:26:22] telling the angel to give me the book
[1:26:26] but thou son of man hear what i say unto
[1:26:28] thee be like now rebellious like the
[1:26:30] rebellious house open the mouth and eat
[1:26:32] what i give thee and when i looked
[1:26:34] behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a
[1:26:37] roll of a book
[1:26:40] remember they didn't have books back
[1:26:41] then
[1:26:43] it was scrolls
[1:26:44] rolled up scrolls like a roll right but
[1:26:47] it's same book
[1:26:49] a roll of a book was therein and he
[1:26:51] spread it before me and it was written
[1:26:53] within and without
[1:26:57] and that revelation is fine
[1:26:59] written on the inside and the outside
[1:27:02] and when i look behold the hand was sent
[1:27:03] unto me and lord roll the book was
[1:27:05] therein and he spread it before me and
[1:27:07] it was written within and without and
[1:27:08] there was written therein lamentation
[1:27:11] and mourning
[1:27:12] and woe all right let's go three this is
[1:27:14] go to chapter three
[1:27:17] he continues his thought moreover he
[1:27:19] saith unto me
[1:27:21] son of man
[1:27:23] eat what thou find us
[1:27:26] now why didn't he tell john the same
[1:27:27] thing right
[1:27:29] eat the book
[1:27:30] eat this roll and go speak unto the
[1:27:32] house of israel
[1:27:34] so i opened my mouth and he caused me to
[1:27:36] eat that roll and he sent unto me son of
[1:27:39] man
[1:27:40] caused thy belly to eat and fill thy
[1:27:42] bowels with this role that i give thee
[1:27:45] sounds like revelations 10 8 right
[1:27:50] and fill thy bowels with this role that
[1:27:51] i give then did i eat and it was in my
[1:27:54] mouth as honey for sweetness
[1:27:57] it left off the bitterness
[1:28:00] why did it leave off the bitterness
[1:28:03] remember in revelations 10 8 9 it says
[1:28:05] that in my belly
[1:28:07] and my mouth was sweet as honey and my
[1:28:09] belly was
[1:28:10] he didn't have a new birth
[1:28:13] he didn't have a new birth
[1:28:16] we have the new birth when we eat it we
[1:28:18] got to live it
[1:28:20] ezekiel didn't so much have to live it
[1:28:22] like we live it
[1:28:24] so it wasn't it was sweet to him because
[1:28:26] he what did he do he prophesied
[1:28:28] he spoke back to him but listen john not
[1:28:30] only had to speak back he's got to live
[1:28:32] it so do me and you
[1:28:34] we got to live it
[1:28:36] and he said unto me son of man go and
[1:28:38] get into the house of israel and speak
[1:28:40] with my words
[1:28:43] unto them
[1:28:45] all right ezekiel
[1:28:47] let's read this right here this is my
[1:28:48] one of my favorite scriptures
[1:28:50] this is talking about
[1:28:52] god in human flesh
[1:28:56] we're going to talk about some drama
[1:29:01] and he said unto me
[1:29:03] son of man
[1:29:04] capital s if you don't see that
[1:29:07] can these bones live
[1:29:11] and i answered oh lord god you're the
[1:29:13] only one that knows because all i see is
[1:29:15] a bunch of dry bones
[1:29:18] again he said unto me prophesy
[1:29:22] unto these bones
[1:29:25] prophesy
[1:29:27] upon these bones
[1:29:29] and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear
[1:29:31] the word of the lord
[1:29:34] what takes you out of
[1:29:36] your dry darkness and death the word of
[1:29:39] god
[1:29:40] thus saith the lord god unto these bones
[1:29:44] that's got to be something to do with
[1:29:46] listen you got flesh on the outside but
[1:29:48] you got bones on the inside
[1:29:50] okay oh ye dry bones
[1:29:54] hear the word of the lord
[1:29:56] thus saith the lord unto these bones
[1:29:57] behold i will cause breath
[1:29:59] to enter into you and you shall live
[1:30:02] and i will lay sinews upon you and will
[1:30:05] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[1:30:07] with skin and put breath in you
[1:30:10] there's four things that happens here we
[1:30:11] know that right
[1:30:13] the four
[1:30:14] brother brown preached this in um
[1:30:16] restoration of the bride tree he talks
[1:30:18] about the four life messages and four
[1:30:19] death messages but we'll not cover that
[1:30:21] because we'll we need to get out of here
[1:30:23] and put breath in you and you shall live
[1:30:25] and you shall know that i am the lord
[1:30:29] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[1:30:32] as i prophesied there was a noise behold
[1:30:35] a shaking
[1:30:37] and the bones came together bone to his
[1:30:39] bone brother let me read real quick one
[1:30:41] quote brother brown says there must have
[1:30:44] been a lot of noise
[1:30:47] he's talking about a pentecostal revival
[1:30:49] he said there must be a lot of noise
[1:30:50] shaking a lot of noise but he said but
[1:30:53] look when the skin came on them and the
[1:30:54] meat came on them there wasn't much
[1:30:56] noise
[1:31:01] so i prophesied as i was commanded and i
[1:31:03] prophesied there was a noise and behold
[1:31:04] a shaking the bones came together bone
[1:31:06] to his bone
[1:31:07] and when i beheld loads of sinews and
[1:31:09] the flesh
[1:31:10] came upon them and the skin covered them
[1:31:12] above
[1:31:13] but there was no breath in them
[1:31:17] because the son of man had breath
[1:31:20] all right
[1:31:21] then said he unto me prophesying to the
[1:31:24] wind prophesy
[1:31:26] son of man
[1:31:27] preachers because that's a little s
[1:31:33] that's a little s not a big ass that's a
[1:31:34] little s prophet sign of the wind
[1:31:36] prophesy son of man in other words
[1:31:38] preach this message
[1:31:40] say to the wind thus saith the lord god

[1:31:44] breathe upon these slain that they may
[1:31:46] live there's no way you're going to get
[1:31:48] breath from god without hearing it from
[1:31:50] somebody that's got breath of god
[1:31:52] amen you got to hear somebody that's got
[1:31:54] the breath of god
[1:31:56] or the baptism of the holy ghost okay
[1:31:58] not your own breath
[1:31:59] sorry it's a breath of god and breathe
[1:32:02] upon these slain that they may live now
[1:32:04] watch this promise
[1:32:06] because what is our promise
[1:32:08] i know it's a body change but our
[1:32:10] promise is a resurrection
[1:32:15] from the
[1:32:16] prophesying of the son of man
[1:32:18] not the son of god son of man listen
[1:32:21] real quick we'll be done
[1:32:23] so i prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:32:25] breath came into them and they lived and
[1:32:27] stood upon their feet an exceeding great
[1:32:28] army
[1:32:29] then he said unto me
[1:32:31] son of man
[1:32:33] these bones are the whole house of
[1:32:35] israel
[1:32:36] behold they say our bones are dried and
[1:32:38] our hope is lost and we are cut off for
[1:32:40] our parts
[1:32:41] therefore prophesying saying to them
[1:32:44] thus saith the lord o my people
[1:32:47] i will open your graves
[1:32:51] i will open your graves son of man

[1:32:57] 12 again i'm sorry i missed that one go
[1:32:59] back towards right there noah 11.
[1:33:04] then he said unto me son of man capital
[1:33:06] s god is standing there o my people i
[1:33:09] will open your graves and cause you to
[1:33:11] come up out of your graves and bring you

[1:34:08] have spoken it and performed it
[1:34:12] saith the lord so it's going to happen
[1:34:14] to national israel but listen folks it's
[1:34:15] got to happen to me and you it's got to
[1:34:18] come to me and you you and i
[1:34:20] are there's to me there's a shaking
[1:34:22] going on
[1:34:23] those dry bones we finally know how to
[1:34:26] get them out of the ground
[1:34:28] you say do you listen we better start
[1:34:30] saying something like that
[1:34:33] you say do you know how no i don't know
[1:34:35] how but i believe we're getting there
[1:34:37] i believe we're getting there i believe
[1:34:38] we're getting strong enough
[1:34:40] and if it's not me i hope it's you
[1:34:43] let's stand our feet musicians come
[1:34:48] prophesy to those dry bones son of man
[1:34:52] put some flesh on those bones son of man
[1:34:55] because son of man is what's going to
[1:34:57] bring the dead out of the ground and
[1:34:58] whatever bones they have laying
[1:35:00] somewhere
[1:35:01] you know what happened to

[1:35:15] sea top of the mountain does not matter
[1:35:17] he knows where you are and he knows your
[1:35:20] name
[1:35:21] prophesy son of man
[1:35:24] maybe that's our problem we haven't
[1:35:25] spoken enough
[1:35:27] but see we won't speak a mess because we
[1:35:28] got to come to a position
[1:35:31] listen even jesus christ had to come to
[1:35:33] a position
[1:35:35] this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased
[1:35:37] to dwell river jordan
[1:35:39] three years later he stands on the
[1:35:41] mountain three years later
[1:35:43] right
[1:35:45] or three and a half years later whatever
[1:35:46] he won't say it he stands on a mountain

[1:35:52] and he says this is my beloved son whom
[1:35:54] i'm pleased to dwell
[1:35:55] hear ye him
[1:35:58] that's why we have to come to adoption
[1:36:00] in the end time for the son of man to
[1:36:02] come on the scene
[1:36:04] we've got to see that we and it's just
[1:36:06] our mandate to get the dead out of the
[1:36:08] ground we got to have the son of man
[1:36:10] here
[1:36:10] he was the one that stood and said i am
[1:36:12] the resurrection and the life he was the
[1:36:14] one who said lazarus come forth and if
[1:36:16] he's inside of me and you today
[1:36:19] we got the resurrection inside of us
[1:36:21] let's sing a song
[1:36:24] there's a
[1:36:26] miracle
[1:36:31] dominating
[1:36:32] the making
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:51] put your bones back together
[1:36:53] it takes god to do that
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:58] it took god almighty to bring lazarus
[1:37:00] out of a tomb
[1:37:02] it took god almighty to make fish
[1:37:05] and loaves enough to feed 5 000 people
[1:37:08] one time and 4 000 people
[1:37:10] the next time
[1:37:12] that was the son of man
[1:37:14] oh there's a miracle
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:23] you know what the greatest miracle is
[1:37:24] going to be
[1:37:25] us realizing who we are
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:28] us realizing who we already are not who
[1:37:31] we're going to be
[1:37:33] [Laughter]
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:46] on
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:38:00] it to him again one more time
[1:38:03] oh
[1:38:04] there's a mirror
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:11] in the making
[1:38:17] one just for you
[1:38:19] the father is
[1:38:22] working
[1:38:23] even now
[1:38:29] your prayers have been heard
[1:38:33] and the answer is
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:53] ezekiel all the dry bones they will send
[1:38:55] you there was meat there was flesh
[1:38:59] but it took a breath of life
[1:39:02] that we naturally don't have
[1:39:05] we naturally can't bring somebody back
[1:39:07] from the dead our natural breath can't
[1:39:09] do it
[1:39:11] but the son of man can do it
[1:39:14] his breath is the breath of life
[1:39:16] and you say well that we're waiting on
[1:39:18] listen if we're waiting on the son of
[1:39:19] man to come back we're in trouble
[1:39:21] amen
[1:39:22] he's back he's here he's trying to do
[1:39:24] the work he was sent here to do
[1:39:26] the capital s-o-n son of man yes the
[1:39:29] lord jesus christ himself
[1:39:31] he's trying to get us to see that but it
[1:39:32] wasn't so much the bone it wasn't the
[1:39:34] sin you the meat and the flesh
[1:39:36] everything was right there together
[1:39:38] but he had to breathe
[1:39:40] that breath of life inside listen adam
[1:39:43] was the same way adam needed the breath
[1:39:45] of life breathing into him and god's the
[1:39:47] only one who can do that but listen god
[1:39:50] through you can do that amen
[1:39:52] god through you can do that
[1:39:54] you know if you get born again
[1:39:57] you've received the breath of god
[1:40:00] the breath of eternal life you've had
[1:40:01] natural breath all your life from the
[1:40:03] day the bot the doctor slapped you on
[1:40:05] the
[1:40:05] rear end and you started crying that's
[1:40:07] natural breath
[1:40:08] that breath will go away
[1:40:11] but when he breathes that spiritual life
[1:40:13] inside of you
[1:40:14] no that's borne by the breath of god
[1:40:17] now let that thing out let it continue
[1:40:20] on and this just continue to be
[1:40:23] diligent
[1:40:24] seeking god seeking the seeking the
[1:40:27] right attitude and the right what we've
[1:40:29] got now
[1:40:30] the son of man is what we're looking for
[1:40:34] the son of man not negate don't get away
[1:40:37] with the son of god do away with the son
[1:40:38] of god you got to have that you got to
[1:40:40] have the new birth you got to have the
[1:40:41] foundation
[1:40:42] but i didn't i'm not the one that said
[1:40:44] it's a different way
[1:40:46] jesus came a different way
[1:40:48] and he was the son of man so we've got
[1:40:50] to look at it a different way
[1:40:52] and it's not going to be hard folks
[1:40:53] because you know what it's part of the
[1:40:54] program somebody god saw before the
[1:40:57] foundational world that somebody every
[1:40:59] time he had a program somebody would
[1:41:01] connect to that program and take off
[1:41:02] with it
[1:41:04] message he'd have a message he knew that
[1:41:06] martin luther was going to pick that
[1:41:07] message up take off with it he knew that
[1:41:10] they would denominate it and he would
[1:41:11] die and go off the scene and wesley
[1:41:13] would pick up a new message
[1:41:14] a new way
[1:41:16] and he would take off with it same way
[1:41:18] with the bride in the end time listen
[1:41:21] don't look for something odd because
[1:41:23] you're already odd
[1:41:24] don't look for something different
[1:41:26] because you're already different
[1:41:28] we just got to dig a little deeper and
[1:41:29] see where the prophet of god tells us a
[1:41:32] whole another way
[1:41:34] he's coming a whole nother you know why
[1:41:36] because the world's going to miss him
[1:41:39] the world's going to miss this coming
[1:41:42] they will not only a few people will
[1:41:44] know about the second coming of jesus
[1:41:46] christ which is the son of man
[1:41:48] the world's not going to know it the
[1:41:50] world's not going to see him come out of
[1:41:51] the eastern sky
[1:41:53] and they think and know that that's
[1:41:54] their savior no he's coming in judgment
[1:41:56] when he does that
[1:41:57] amen they've already missed the second
[1:41:59] coming of jesus christ because who is
[1:42:01] the second coming of jesus christ we are
[1:42:04] we're the second coming of christ
[1:42:06] because he's not coming back in any
[1:42:07] other flesh but mine and yours
[1:42:09] amen and that's what the prophet spent
[1:42:11] all them years trying to tell us
[1:42:13] god is here
[1:42:14] you are the word made manifest you are
[1:42:16] the word made flesh
[1:42:19] you are not somebody that's coming you
