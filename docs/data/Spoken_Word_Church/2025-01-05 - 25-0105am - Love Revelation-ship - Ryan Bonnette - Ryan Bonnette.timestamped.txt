[0:00] talking about choosing love love is a
[0:02] choice uh not so much this fairy tale
[0:04] love that Hollywood paints for us you
[0:06] know through movies and so forth about
[0:08] this love at first sight and this fairy
[0:10] tale sort of situation but real love
[0:12] starts and it continues in a lifelong
[0:15] journey and I'm talking about love our
[0:17] love with the Lord our relationship with
[0:19] him as well as love and marriage and so
[0:22] forth it should start and grow stronger
[0:24] as time goes
[0:25] on and uh so with that that's the review
[0:29] of the last lesson so I'm going to pray
[0:31] before we start on this new lesson of
[0:34] Revelation heavly father we thank you
[0:36] for letting us get to be here Lord today
[0:37] pray you bless this lesson for your
[0:39] people Lord let it be a blessing to them
[0:41] I pray pray bless the service today help

[1:03] forgot to pray for and just again just
[1:05] give us understanding as we studying you
[1:07] this morning in Jesus name
[1:10] amen um so as I was saying this uh real
[1:13] love requires intention it doesn't just
[1:16] happen accidentally and um also um take
[1:20] everything that I'd say in this lesson
[1:21] and all these series of Love lessons and
[1:23] also apply it to marriage almost all of
[1:26] what I'm saying about our love
[1:27] relationship with the Lord can be
[1:29] applied to marriage to help those of you
[1:31] who are married as
[1:33] well so um I I like to quote the phrase
[1:37] getting to know that girl um when I
[1:40] first met Gabby October 14th 2006 in
[1:43] monello Kentucky I just went up to
[1:45] introduced myself to a young lady who
[1:47] was sitting by herself I felt sorry for
[1:49] and I said well no youth should be left
[1:50] out at a young Camp Youth Camp I said
[1:53] I'm just going to go up make her feel
[1:54] welcome I walked away not thinking any
[1:56] more of her than anybody else any other
[1:58] pretty girl at a youth camp
[2:00] walked away and then something hit me in
[2:02] the head like a Bullet in the Brain and
[2:03] said you need to get to know that girl
[2:05] he didn't say go marry her he didn't say
[2:07] have four kids with her he didn't say
[2:08] spend your life with her he just said
[2:10] you need to get to know that girl and I
[2:13] didn't know why but um later I found out
[2:17] that he put in her every single little
[2:20] thing I'd been praying for for many
[2:22] years before that for a wife specific
[2:24] little details I've been asking God for
[2:26] for a wife he put that in her and I
[2:28] would not have known that if I had I got
[2:30] to know her everything we need we find
[2:33] in Christ and you don't know that unless
[2:35] you start this
[2:37] Revelation which I'm going to Define I
[2:39] made up the word it's I mean this it's
[2:41] been around a while that's you can find
[2:43] that word on various places but um for
[2:45] the sake of this lesson I want to Define
[2:47] that word as a relationship based on
[2:50] receiving Revelation from
[2:51] God simple as that we need Revelation
[2:54] more than anything we need to call on
[2:56] God for Revelation more than anything
[2:57] else in the world brother benam said
[3:00] it's so key so important for us to get
[3:01] to know him and in him we'll find
[3:04] everything we need okay everything we
[3:06] need for lives Jing everything we need
[3:08] spiritually uh naturally in every way so
[3:11] this relationship is so
[3:13] important uh 1 Corinthians 2 as is
[3:16] written ith not seen ear not heard
[3:18] neither ha entered into the heart of man
[3:19] the things which God ha prepared for
[3:21] them that love him God hath revealed
[3:24] them unto us by his spirit for the
[3:27] spirit searches all things yeah the Deep
[3:29] things of God for what man knoweth the
[3:31] things of man save the spirit of man
[3:32] which is in him even so the things of
[3:34] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[3:38] now we have received not the spirit of
[3:40] the world but the spirit which is of god
[3:41] that we might know the things that are
[3:43] freely given to us of God which things
[3:45] we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom
[3:47] teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[3:49] comparing spiritual things with
[3:50] spiritual we must be receiving
[3:52] revelation we have to have a real
[3:54] intimate relationship with the Lord
[3:56] otherwise it's kind of superficial you
[3:58] can have kind of a just a superficial re
[4:01] uh relationship with the Lord where you
[4:03] just kind of know him you believe him
[4:05] you love him but there comes a time
[4:07] where that's not enough when you need
[4:09] more and a more intimate relationship
[4:12] like brother Brown talked about that
[4:13] three- room house you know you you can
[4:15] know him for a while in the living room
[4:17] and or in the kitchen but some at some
[4:18] point you need to have an intimate
[4:20] relationship go further with the Lord
[4:23] and that requires this Revelation
[4:25] receiving of
[4:28] Revelation so
[4:30] talking about daily bread Isaiah 28 Whom
[4:33] Shall he teach knowledge and to whom
[4:35] shall he make uh to understand Doctrine
[4:37] them that are wean from the milk and
[4:38] drawn from the breast and for a while
[4:40] it's okay for us to drink milk but we
[4:43] need precept upon precept line upon line
[4:46] here little there little for stem lips
[4:48] and another Tong while I speak to this
[4:50] people I say that I'm quoting that
[4:52] precept upon precept line upon line here
[4:54] a little there a little because don't
[4:56] overlook those little Revelations it's
[4:58] all important if you look at I think
[5:00] brother Tony didn't you do the stone
[5:02] work outside the church whoever did the
[5:05] stone work out who did that I don't even
[5:07] know they hire okay so whoever did that
[5:10] if you notice there's big rocks and
[5:12] there's little rocks but they're all
[5:14] important any any building you look at
[5:16] there's big parts and there's little
[5:17] Parts but they're all important the
[5:19] smallest little pieces of Revelation
[5:20] that you get in your journey are all
[5:22] important I've been serving the lord for
[5:24] 28 years and since I was 12 and I look
[5:27] through the last 28 years of my life
[5:29] Journey
[5:30] and I think well there's mostly just
[5:32] little pieces here a little there a
[5:33] little precept upon precept line upon
[5:35] line very few of these Cornerstone
[5:37] Revelations there are a few of them
[5:39] though that turn my life around like
[5:41] coming to the message out of the Baptist
[5:43] Church and so forth but most of it made
[5:45] up of these little bitty pieces so don't
[5:47] overlook don't belittle those little
[5:49] bitty Revelations you get along the way
[5:51] that's all part of
[5:52] it so from uh Waters of Separation
[5:56] brother B says you come to the church
[5:58] water separation that's all right hear
[5:59] the word it's good you get separated
[6:01] from your sin but you go out with an
[6:03] intellectual Faith that's the reason you
[6:05] can't believe that's the reason you go
[6:07] back out and sin the way you do the
[6:08] reason you can't hold up from one
[6:09] Revival to another if you let the
[6:11] intellectual faith move down through
[6:12] your brain into your heart then it
[6:14] becomes a reality with a new birth then
[6:16] it'll stay there anchored forever God
[6:21] sealed you in by the Holy Spirit and
[6:23] it's settled
[6:25] forever you know um there was a time
[6:29] early on in the message I had had had
[6:32] that Cornerstone Revelation that God
[6:34] brought me to the message all right and
[6:35] I thought well I'm set now I'm set this
[6:37] is great this I'm at Lula I'm hearing
[6:38] the revelation of the word this is
[6:40] awesome this is where I need to be and I
[6:42] floated Along on pastor's coattail for a
[6:44] while cast in my vote and that's good to
[6:47] do say cast your vote with your pastor
[6:48] say he's my pastor I believe what he
[6:50] preaches about false Doctrine don't
[6:52] fully understand some what he brought
[6:53] out 2004 about certain false doctrines I
[6:56] didn't really quite follow it but he
[6:58] said uh he's preaching know this is what
[7:01] they preach and this is what brother
[7:02] brandham said and and now you decide
[7:04] what to believe and I didn't quite
[7:05] follow but I said I'm going to cast my
[7:07] vat with brother Dell I believe what he
[7:08] believes because he's my pastor that's
[7:10] good for a time but at some point you
[7:12] can't ride pastor's coil in 2006 Gabby
[7:16] and I both faced a situation about false
[7:18] Doctrine head-to-head for the first time
[7:20] we had to find out what we believe and
[7:23] we had to seek God desperately for
[7:26] Revelation about those doctrines because
[7:28] I couldn't disting English I couldn't
[7:30] really tell which way was right and
[7:33] that's when I believe the Lord was
[7:34] turning to me and saying Ryan who do you
[7:36] say I the son of man am Gabby who do you
[7:39] say I the son of man am can't be right
[7:42] in pastor's coat tell
[7:43] anymore so that's when we had another I
[7:47] had this Cornerstone
[7:49] Revelation and then it gave me a real
[7:51] Firm Foundation good
[7:53] foothold in the days of the voice this
[7:56] is quoted from Brother Luis October 30th
[7:59] yes I like to quot to our ministers
[8:01] because I believe what they're preaching
[8:03] and I believe in studying and going back
[8:06] and Rel listening what they preach
[8:08] because there is so much in there that
[8:09] you won't get sitting here in the
[8:11] service for me personally I have to go
[8:13] back and Rel listen multiple multiple
[8:15] times and that's what I do through the
[8:16] week Gabby does the same thing staying
[8:18] up till 2:00 or 3: in the morning she's
[8:20] up anyway she can't sleep she says you
[8:22] know it's insomnia or whatever she's
[8:24] going to be up for one reason or another
[8:26] but she dedicates that time to read and
[8:28] listen to or to listen to our ministers
[8:31] and I do to likewise when I'm driving
[8:32] the chicken truck and I find there's so
[8:34] many nuggets that I missed even when I
[8:36] sitting here in the service so that's
[8:38] part of what I'm saying here to come to
[8:40] this Revelation you have to go back and
[8:43] dig and and make some sacrifice and give
[8:46] up some things give up some time give
[8:48] some effort forfeit some sleep forfeit
[8:50] some food forfeit whatever you have to
[8:52] whatever stands in your way say get out
[8:54] of my way I'm coming if it's your job
[8:56] schedule you can change things around
[8:58] and give up whatever you have to to be
[9:00] here and to listen and then go back and
[9:03] relisten and study and pray and seek God
[9:06] I found out for many years as a daily
[9:09] Bible reader that I was still missing a
[9:11] lot you can read your Bible every day
[9:12] and devotions and you still miss a whole
[9:15] lot of this Revelation so I mean I it
[9:18] takes more than just daily Bible reading
[9:21] it takes more than study and comparing
[9:22] verse with verse brother bam said so
[9:26] brother Louise says it's not enough for
[9:29] just the preacher to study the word amen
[9:31] it's not enough for just the Evangelist
[9:33] to study the word the pastor amen you've
[9:34] got to take the open little book let me
[9:37] tell you what the book is open it's not
[9:40] closed so it's not too difficult to
[9:42] study amen praise God it's an open book
[9:44] in this hour amen God has spoken it amen
[9:47] through the seventh Church age messenger
[9:50] it's up to us to take it in it's up to
[9:51] you if you're going to take it in or not
[9:54] so the book is open the book is open and
[9:56] that's for sure amen so I told my dream
[10:00] couple years ago I think it was I had a
[10:03] dream I dream a lot and I dream in very
[10:06] intricate detail I don't know why very
[10:08] few of them I've ever had were really
[10:10] spiritual but I thought this one was and
[10:12] if it's not then I apologize and God
[10:14] forgive me for even mentioning it but I
[10:16] believe there's a lot of spiritual
[10:18] symbolism in here and I've meditated on
[10:20] it over the years and it's helped me I
[10:22] hope it'll help y'all so I'd had this
[10:24] dream early in the week and then I
[10:27] prayed and said Lord is that for me or
[10:29] should I I mentioned to the congregation
[10:31] come middle of that week I woke up from
[10:33] another sleep and heard brother Dell's
[10:36] voice distinctly say tell the dream so I
[10:39] I came to church that Wednesday night
[10:42] and brother Bob was preaching unbeliever
[10:45] make believer and unbeliever and I took
[10:47] that as another confirmation from the
[10:49] Lord because that's what the dream is
[10:51] about so in the dream and then I stood
[10:54] up and told the dream that's when I told
[10:55] it to the church here out in the parking
[10:57] lot this took place at church out in the
[11:00] parking lot that was not a parking lot
[11:01] it was a
[11:03] pond and I was walking around the bank
[11:06] of this Pond the circumference walking
[11:08] around and around and my hand I had two
[11:11] things one was some kind of a grain meal
[11:14] like we'll just say cornmeal I'm not
[11:16] sure something something for food and I
[11:18] was tossing it into the pond by handfuls
[11:21] the other ingredient was oil okay and I
[11:24] was pouring that into the pond and I was
[11:25] walking around and around the pond
[11:29] and uh at some point I don't know if
[11:32] this is uh significant or not I ran out
[11:34] of oil came into church to get more oil
[11:38] sister June as she is a helper so many
[11:41] people I believe that's part of her her
[11:42] Ministry in life is to help people she's
[11:44] helped me she's helped Gabby helped our
[11:45] family she's helped a lot of people here
[11:46] she's a helper she was the one in the
[11:48] basement here helping me get more oil I
[11:50] went back
[11:52] out excuse me and I went back to what I
[11:55] was doing walking around and around this
[11:57] Pond pouring in these ingredients all
[11:59] and some kind of
[12:00] meal all right and as I walked around I
[12:03] observed three different characters one
[12:07] was this boy similar to that in the
[12:09] picture doing what a boy typically does
[12:11] just immature jumping in and out of the
[12:14] pond he was never constant and let's
[12:16] just say the pond represents the word of
[12:18] God as water often does in scripture so
[12:21] let's just say that was the word of God
[12:23] he was in and out he was just up and
[12:24] down in and out never steady never
[12:26] constant he would jump in the pond and
[12:29] then run back and then he jump in again
[12:31] just kind of like playing Church you
[12:32] know here sometimes sometimes he's not
[12:35] sometimes he's here sometimes he's not
[12:36] you never know when that kind of
[12:38] believer or that kind of person is going
[12:39] to be at church there was this other
[12:41] character a young lady like that in the
[12:44] picture there on the left on a
[12:47] slide and it was fixed to where it was
[12:50] sliding down into the pool she never
[12:52] would slide in she had every opportunity
[12:55] easily to get into that pool and really
[12:57] get all the way in but she was just kind
[12:59] of like a borderline believer she was
[13:01] just sitting there she wouldn't get in
[13:03] she'd stay at the water but never get in
[13:06] always there but never got in and I kept
[13:09] walking around and around the pond and
[13:11] observed another
[13:13] character and this was a young lady I
[13:16] couldn't really see her clearly
[13:18] because of the the water it was kind of
[13:20] distorting my vision of her I could tell
[13:22] by looking down in the water as I walked
[13:24] around that far end of the pool or Pond
[13:27] as I kept walking around I would look
[13:29] down and I would see her looking up at
[13:31] me the whole time smiling and happy to
[13:34] receive what I was ministering to her is
[13:36] like handfuls of meal and or you know
[13:39] cornmeal or whatever and oil she was
[13:41] happy to receive it always in that water
[13:43] never moved always stable always steady
[13:47] always just content and and pacified if
[13:51] you will just to sit there and receive
[13:53] what was being ministered to her and she
[13:55] just watched me intently every time I
[13:56] made a pass she just watched me intently
[13:59] focused never in and out up and down
[14:01] never on the borderline always in
[14:04] completely submerged stay in there and
[14:06] to me she represents the True Believer
[14:07] the bride just stay in there always in
[14:10] that water always submerged always
[14:13] believing that's what a Believer does a
[14:15] Believer believes no matter what and
[14:18] stays in this
[14:20] Revelation always there uh seeking more
[14:23] of God and a close walk with
[14:26] him okay might refer back to that some
[14:29] more here in a moment so the Holy Ghost
[14:32] can't ever be false this is uh brother
[14:34] Wade from October 27th last year the
[14:37] Holy Ghost is always going to be true
[14:39] and if it falls on a True Believer it
[14:41] makes that person true everybody with me
[14:43] but remember God seals a group in and
[14:47] then he rebukes a group that he's trying
[14:50] to come on and they continue on thinking
[14:52] they've got this and they don't y'all
[14:54] are familiar with deception deception is
[14:57] where you really believe something
[14:59] something and you don't know you're
[15:00] wrong I never questioned the Trinity as
[15:03] a Baptist I never showed up at church
[15:05] one Sunday in the Baptist Church said I
[15:07] wonder about that Trinity is that really
[15:09] true never had a second thought about it
[15:12] until I came here never even had a
[15:13] thought about it being wrong that's
[15:15] called
[15:15] deception you can be in a deception but
[15:20] and you really believe it so the point
[15:23] is follow Christ no matter what and that
[15:27] Holy Ghost as part of the new birth
[15:28] process says he will Search Your Heart
[15:31] find what's wrong that you don't even
[15:33] know is wrong okay you don't know what's
[15:35] wrong if you're deceived all right well
[15:37] his job is he'll find that he's an
[15:40] expert he knows what's wrong in you when
[15:42] you don't and then he'll put a man in
[15:44] the pull pit to address it the problem
[15:46] is if you're not
[15:48] here that's a big problem you've missed
[15:50] your day of visitation please go back
[15:52] and relisten and dig that's part of what
[15:54] I'm talking about being that True
[15:55] Believer that girl under that pond
[15:58] that's always always here always
[16:01] listening intently focused and going
[16:02] back and realising and real listen and
[16:04] realising get every little nugget that
[16:06] you miss search for it like treasure
[16:08] like your life depends on
[16:11] it cuz you can go on in a deception and
[16:14] not know it so that was uh this is I
[16:18] think that's the same sermon yeah
[16:20] brother the way that was brother
[16:22] Banner's whole message he would look out
[16:23] on the whole congregation and he could
[16:25] discern who had the Holy Ghost and who
[16:26] didn't he could say move Pentecostal
[16:28] Church move
[16:29] you got to move with
[16:31] God there they sat on that slide like
[16:34] that girl in my dreams sitting on the
[16:35] slide would not fully move on and they
[16:38] just sit right there and he'd watch the
[16:40] Holy Ghost continue on everybody with me
[16:42] let's go let's don't do that here let's
[16:44] don't do that here well I'm sitting here
[16:45] at Lula I'm fine I'm comfortable
[16:47] everything is good I sat there for
[16:49] several years myself reading my Bible
[16:52] every day come to church every service
[16:54] sat there didn't know that there was
[16:56] something I was missing riding pastor's
[16:58] coatel
[16:59] believe in brother Dell and that's good
[17:01] believe brother way but there Comes A
[17:03] Time God will wink at your ignorance
[17:06] there comes a time when he commands you
[17:07] to repent of your own false Doctrine the
[17:10] things that you believe that you don't
[17:12] know is wrong yes that's what brother
[17:15] Bam's whole message was okay let's uh
[17:18] what kind of experience this is brother
[17:21] Bob black from October 20th what kind of
[17:23] experience are we talking about a
[17:24] personal encounter with Christ where
[17:26] you've read about it you've learned
[17:27] about it and then now you meet him you
[17:29] meet him it's a revelatory experience
[17:31] that transform you deep within because
[17:34] Christ has become personally known
[17:36] Revelation that's everything I'm talking
[17:38] about today
[17:39] Revelation you know him it's not that
[17:42] you just read about it but you now know
[17:46] him there's a transition know him on a
[17:50] superficial level that's fine keep going
[17:52] though just don't stop I'm begging you
[17:55] don't stop there I tell you what when
[17:57] you know him then you can fall in love
[17:58] with him him and you can begin to know
[18:00] him in these dark moments you praying
[18:01] beside your bed at night and David
[18:03] tossed around um as he would say the
[18:05] Deep call to the
[18:08] deep and also brother Bob I think that
[18:10] same sermon then you begin to know him
[18:12] it's not just something that you've
[18:13] heard about but you know him it's a deep
[18:16] internal change a complete shift in your
[18:18] nature now the new birth let's not get
[18:20] this wrong the new birth is the start of
[18:22] your regeneration you're going to begin
[18:23] to grow the statue perfect man you're
[18:25] just getting a place to grow now but I
[18:28] tell you what then you're when you're
[18:29] born again it starts something you're
[18:30] going to start to change something
[18:31] begins to change and makes you different
[18:33] deep internal change uh let's I think I
[18:35] repeated that but what you want you want
[18:38] more of God because you know the way to
[18:40] life is through the word you're going to
[18:43] get more life you got to come to the
[18:47] word all right and then you tell me a
[18:50] born- again Christian don't want some
[18:51] more word you tell me a born again
[18:53] Christian don't want to be in the house
[18:54] of God there's something that changes
[18:56] when you're born again you want more of
[18:58] the word because it brings you to the
[18:59] life not just a change in Behavior a
[19:01] transformation of identity from in
[19:04] Exodus brother benam says you're not
[19:06] saved because you pack a crucifix or
[19:08] because you go to church because you
[19:10] know your catechism your textbook you're
[19:11] not even saved because you know the
[19:12] Bible you're saved because you know the
[19:14] person Jesus Christ to know him is life
[19:16] not even know his word is life but to
[19:18] know him the person is life there's only
[19:21] one way to know him that's to be born
[19:22] again the spirit of God
[19:30] okay and then from the basis of
[19:31] Fellowship now you haven't you only live
[19:33] in a three room house I quoted this
[19:35] earlier you may have three or four room
[19:37] bedrooms pantries or so forth or the
[19:39] kitchen let's skip on down but uh that's
[19:41] right you live in a three- room house
[19:43] God lived in a three room house father
[19:44] son Holy Spirit you live in a three room
[19:46] house soul body and
[19:48] spirit uh the basis of Fellowship I got
[19:50] to really kind of rush along got
[19:51] something I want to get to here that's
[19:53] the kitchen part fellowshipping Faith
[19:55] coming by hearing then the next thing in
[19:56] the other room is the engagement room a
[19:58] lot of people think as long as they get
[20:00] into the kitchen that's all they have to
[20:01] do so there's that slide in my dream
[20:03] you're sitting on that slide at the pool
[20:05] or Pond always waiting but never getting
[20:08] in you're just feeding then you're just
[20:10] getting food uh fed basis of Fellowship
[20:12] but the next room is where only not only
[20:15] Fellowship but relationship comes and
[20:17] that's what's the matter with the church
[20:18] today they got a shame face you can't
[20:19] catch my Parable they don't want that
[20:23] relationship with God
[20:26] Revelation so they'd rather have some
[20:28] sto called formaly organization and
[20:31] Presbyterian methods Bap Pentecostal
[20:33] that really come down to the
[20:35] relationship with
[20:36] God
[20:38] okay uh this is Brother Wade um just
[20:42] about a month ago uh just it's our
[20:44] problem that we say well I don't know I
[20:46] don't understand that there's nothing in
[20:48] this Bible you can't understand if
[20:49] you'll get somebody if you'll pray hard
[20:51] enough God will explain it to you
[20:53] there's nobody here that cannot get this
[20:56] Revelation if you'll try and if you'll
[20:57] seek God God will never let you say well
[21:00] now you're just a dummy you don't
[21:02] understand that now has he ever told
[21:04] anybody that God won't tell you you're a
[21:06] dummy if you said that you told yourself
[21:08] that God didn't tell you that because
[21:09] you see people leave church because I
[21:12] can't understand what brother Dell says
[21:13] I can't understand what brother Wade I
[21:14] can't understand brother the Bob I'm
[21:15] just going to leave well you never had
[21:18] anything to begin with you can't leave
[21:20] the word of God and say that I can't
[21:21] understand that if you're born
[21:23] again you might not understand for a
[21:25] moment but keep going be patient that
[21:28] girl in the water in my dream in that
[21:30] pond she was patient she always sat
[21:33] right there intently focused on the
[21:34] ministry delivering the word to her she
[21:36] would never leave every time they made a
[21:39] minister would make a pass she was there
[21:41] receiving the word okay she would never
[21:43] leave that spot just weeks months years
[21:46] however long it takes stay right there
[21:48] God's obligated folks obligated to
[21:51] brothers and sisters he's obligated to
[21:52] put somebody in the pull pit that will
[21:53] explain your question you got to be here
[21:56] okay that's one thing about it you got
[21:57] to be here and if you're not at least go
[21:59] back and relisten over and over again
[22:01] brother benam said that he's obligated
[22:03] only a prophet can say that he's
[22:04] obligated God's obligated to put
[22:06] somebody the problem is that we hear
[22:07] something like that we close our ears up
[22:10] we don't go to study we don't get in our
[22:11] prayer closet and say God I didn't
[22:13] understand that word the man said today
[22:16] you said you'd explain it to me how many
[22:18] times have we had questions and brother
[22:19] Dell would preach something that we'd be
[22:21] like no I I don't know about that he
[22:24] said I'll raise my hand I'll raise both
[22:25] of them God can't send something
[22:28] something to his children and say I know
[22:31] you can't understand that but I'm going
[22:32] to put it in the Bible anyway God's not
[22:34] that way God will never do that he'd be
[22:36] unjust God and we crack that book during
[22:39] the week I'm going to preach here uh we
[22:41] don't crack that book open during the
[22:43] week and we don't study it we don't
[22:44] reread the scripture maybe or I read or
[22:47] brother Bob or brother Aaron Brother Lis
[22:49] so go back and restudy what was preached
[22:50] here you know we take notes and my me
[22:52] and my girls and we go back and every
[22:55] Saturday or so we have a Bible study
[22:56] that's based on just what's being
[22:58] preached we go back and riew the the
[23:00] notes the sermon the and relist the
[23:03] sermons that that were quoted from
[23:05] brother brandham and you know review the
[23:08] the scriptures and so forth um you just
[23:10] go and say well that was good it happens
[23:13] all the time happens all the time so why
[23:14] do we keep letting it happen all the
[23:16] time because if you don't understand
[23:18] God's G us somebody to help us
[23:20] understand he giv us a prophet he gave
[23:21] us a fful Ministry that's why you're not
[23:23] going to get it just sitting at home
[23:25] you're just not going to get it sitting
[23:26] at home re listening to tapes
[23:29] persever brother B said now I can't
[23:30] imagine them seeing that there was some
[23:33] people might have had might have been a
[23:35] borderline believer you know what that
[23:37] old man could have been right just the
[23:39] kind that hangs around the meetings you
[23:40] know it comes to every meeting and said
[23:42] that old man but never willing to come
[23:44] in never willing to accept
[23:48] it I may have to just skip on down to
[23:50] the main part here of what I wanted to
[23:53] quote because I'm running out of
[23:55] time main thing I wanted to get to is
[23:58] the church ages this is commonly quoted
[24:00] around here we're very familiar with it
[24:02] it's SE position of the seven Church
[24:04] ages then I mentioned that it takes the
[24:06] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation we'll
[24:08] fail to get it bringing these two
[24:09] thoughts together we see that it won't
[24:10] take just an ordinary student study and
[24:13] thinking to make this book real it's
[24:14] going to take the operation of the Holy
[24:16] Ghost that means this book can't be
[24:18] revealed to anyone but a special class
[24:21] of people it will take one with
[24:23] prophetic Insight it will require the
[24:25] ability to hear from god require a
[24:27] supernatural instruction not just a
[24:29] student can bring verse with verse your
[24:31] daily Bible reading is good and don't
[24:32] stop that I believe in that I firmly
[24:34] believe in Daily Bible reading and
[24:35] devotions but don't stop right there
[24:37] it's like a devotion I read recently
[24:39] it's like if you read the Bible and you
[24:42] don't meditate on it it's kind of like
[24:43] eating food and not digesting it you're
[24:46] not going to get the nutrition you need
[24:47] so you need to read it but then meditate
[24:50] on it listen to the sermons but then
[24:52] meditate on them throughout the whole
[24:53] week uh mystery requires a teaching of
[24:56] the Spirit orever come becomes clear how
[24:58] we need to hear from God and lay
[24:59] ourselves open become yielded of the
[25:02] spirit to hear and know so be that girl
[25:05] that bride submerged in the water in my
[25:09] dream be be that always submerged never
[25:13] in and out up and down wish you washing
[25:15] I have already said this book Revelation
[25:16] and consummation of scriptures even
[25:18] placed exactly right in the Canon
[25:19] scriptures at the end you cannot know
[25:22] why it says that Anyone who reads or
[25:24] hears it or so you can know um if you
[25:27] basically he's saying if you change or
[25:28] add to it you'll be cursed it would have
[25:30] to be so for who can add or take away
[25:32] from the perfect word of
[25:35] God
[25:37] okay uh M musicians can go ahead and
[25:39] make your way up here and I'll make a
[25:40] few more quotes here from Hebrews 12
[25:44] wherefor see we are so compassed about
[25:45] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[25:47] aside every weight and the sin which
[25:48] does so easily beset us get out of your
[25:50] way whatever is hindering you like I
[25:52] said earlier job or whatever it is that
[25:54] would hinder you from being here from
[25:56] listening to sermons and Rel listening
[25:57] to them
[25:59] um from the days of John the Baptist
[26:01] till now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered
[26:02] violence and the B take it by force we
[26:04] need to be forceful the beginning of
[26:06] this year we were given a
[26:08] commission by brother uh Andrew Glover
[26:13] the main point he was making on the
[26:14] watch Night Service was keep
[26:16] walking and that doesn't sound very
[26:18] profound but it's really deep if you
[26:20] think about it it has to do with
[26:21] everything that I'm saying today just
[26:22] keep walking what if you might say R
[26:25] what if I'm that guy that's playing
[26:26] church I'm in and out will start being
[26:28] Church what if I'm the girl on the slide
[26:30] that's at the pool all the time but
[26:32] won't get fully in we'll go ahead and
[26:34] get in but really you can't put yourself
[26:37] in that you can't throw yourself in 2006
[26:39] what happened to me was God intervened
[26:42] but I was continuing on I wouldn't stop
[26:44] but God's the one that moved me up
[26:46] higher God has to move you up higher in
[26:47] Revelation but you have to be there you
[26:49] got to make yourself
[26:51] available and so you you say well I'm
[26:53] not receiving Revelation just keep
[26:55] pressing keep praying keep serving God
[26:57] he's faithful um it's like brother Dell
[27:01] um he dedicated himself his whole life
[27:03] everything about him was dedicated to
[27:04] the word of God just be that person be
[27:07] fully
[27:08] submerged keeping that Revelation sh
[27:11] every day reading the Bible without
[27:12] meditating I already quoted this is like
[27:14] eating food without digesting it you
[27:17] don't get the nutrition you need unless
[27:18] you digest it you don't get the divine
[27:20] revelation you need without meditating
[27:21] on the word of
[27:23] God okay
[27:28] let's skip on ahead here um that's the
[27:30] way message is you can sympathize with
[27:32] and say it's right but you've got to
[27:35] take it yourself to become part of it
[27:38] and then the message become one you and
[27:40] the message become one then the
[27:41] anointing is with you as it was with the
[27:43] others okay so be that girl that's all
[27:46] I'm going to close with on that God
[27:47] bless you all and by the way we are
[27:49] short of a musician Brother Richard is
[27:52] out today he's been coughing a lot so
