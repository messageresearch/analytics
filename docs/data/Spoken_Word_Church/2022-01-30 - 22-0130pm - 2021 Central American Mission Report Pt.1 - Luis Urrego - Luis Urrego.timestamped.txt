[0:00] on the internet
[0:01] and it was about psalms 23 and it says i
[0:04] have to admit i always wondered what
[0:07] this part of psalms 23 meant i thought
[0:10] he anoints my head with oil
[0:13] was
[0:14] figurative language for god keeping the
[0:17] psalmist healthy i never knew this
[0:19] parallel
[0:20] anoint my head with oil
[0:23] she can get their head caught in the
[0:25] briars and die trying to get untangled
[0:28] there are
[0:29] hybrid little flies
[0:32] that like to torment sheep by laying
[0:34] eggs in their nostrils which turn into
[0:37] worms and drive the sheep
[0:39] to beat their head against a rock
[0:42] sometimes to death their ears in their
[0:45] eyes are also susceptible to tormenting
[0:48] insects
[0:49] so the shepherd shepherd anoints their
[0:52] whole head with oil
[0:54] then there is peace
[0:56] that oil forms a barrier of protection
[0:59] against the evil that tries to destroy
[1:01] the sheep
[1:02] do you have times of mental torment
[1:05] do the worrisome thoughts invade your
[1:08] mind over and over
[1:10] do you beat your head against a wall
[1:12] trying to stop them
[1:14] have you ever asked god to anoint your
[1:16] head with oil he has an endless supply
[1:20] his oil protects and makes it possible
[1:23] for you to fix your heart mind and eyes
[1:28] on him today and always
[1:30] there is peace in the valley
[1:32] may
[1:33] our good
[1:34] good father anoint your head with oil
[1:37] today so that your cup overflows with
[1:40] blessings god is good and he is faithful
[1:45] the reason i wanted to read that after i
[1:47] read that this morning
[1:49] this
[1:50] itching from the shingles has been
[1:52] torment and i sit up here in church and
[1:55] i'm scratching and it's driving me crazy
[1:57] so after i read that i prayed and asked
[2:00] god to anoint my head with oil and to
[2:02] stop that itching stop that torment that
[2:05] this itching is driving me crazy i want
[2:07] to beat my head against the wall
[2:09] i have not itched
[2:11] since then well i did a moment when bob
[2:13] was up here doing sunday school i prayed
[2:16] the same prayer again
[2:18] and since that
[2:19] bob was up here i have not itched again
[2:23] so
[2:24] it worked
[2:34] yes
[2:35] probably going to sing open the eyes of
[2:36] my heart
[2:39] brother luis is ready to go so
[2:41] first thing let's sing open the eyes of
[2:43] my heart and my brother elise come

[4:20] [Music]
[4:34] praise the lord jesus it's good to be
[4:36] behind this desk once again
[4:39] i've been here about eight weeks maybe
[4:41] yeah it's good to be back and uh
[4:44] appreciate sister susan that testimony
[4:47] god is a healing god
[4:49] he heals it in the simplest ways so we
[4:51] just thank god for that
[4:53] um
[4:55] we just um
[4:56] we just think it's counted a privilege
[4:58] to be uh to be part of this uh
[5:00] congregation
[5:02] amen i know we don't join anything we
[5:04] don't we're not we're not members here
[5:06] or anything like that
[5:08] but we're members of the bride of jesus
[5:09] christ here in lula georgia amen
[5:12] amen so so it just counted the privilege
[5:16] and um
[5:32] no i just really didn't have my tie to
[5:34] put it in so i got the sweater on so i
[5:37] didn't i was like okay i could just put
[5:38] it here
[5:40] but if my beard starts scratching it
[5:42] i'll just pick up one of the
[5:46] lord bless you all um
[5:48] we want to we want to go ahead and uh
[5:50] let us let's just turn to revelations
[5:52] chapter 10 revelations chapter 10
[5:57] and
[6:02] and we want to read from verses uh
[6:07] let's just read from verse 8
[6:10] down to verse 11.
[6:12] this is one of my favorite scriptures
[6:14] in the in the in the bible just one of
[6:17] them but this was this is the scripture
[6:19] that that was my theme for the uh for
[6:22] the
[6:22] for the our trip that we just took
[6:25] and this is what i was trying to get
[6:26] people to see well i was just preaching
[6:29] but i was hoping that the lord would
[6:30] just do the work let the lord do the
[6:32] talking um the whole point the whole
[6:36] point of of of what i was trying to
[6:38] minister to the people as we were going
[6:40] by different places is to let them know
[6:42] that
[6:44] that they are now the sons of god amen
[6:48] and to take what is already been opened
[6:51] for them you know to take their
[6:53] positions in christ not something that's
[6:55] coming or something that was but
[6:57] something that is
[6:59] and that if you just get into the is
[7:01] you'll you won't miss the what's coming
[7:04] and i was trying to get people to see
[7:06] during the trip you know uh
[7:08] you know it's the the gift of god is is
[7:11] for you
[7:12] it's got your name wrapped it's got your
[7:14] name on it it's wrapped in even a little
[7:16] bulge all you got to do is just take it
[7:18] and that's the part that i believe that
[7:20] we even here in the states that we have
[7:22] a hard time grasping
[7:24] that the promises of god are yea and
[7:26] amen
[7:28] and the varying man that means so be it
[7:30] they're yours they're yours now and not
[7:32] tomorrow but they're yours now
[7:35] and so i i believe god uh in many
[7:38] different instances during our trip um i
[7:40] believe
[7:41] the
[7:42] if i was talking to this with brother
[7:44] wade that uh if you could just at least
[7:46] get the ministers or pastors to see that
[7:48] then they can continue preaching that to
[7:50] the people
[7:52] because uh um it's very important um if
[7:55] you can just get them to see that so
[7:57] let's just read this real quick and then
[7:59] i'll have you be seated in revelations
[8:01] chapter 10 verse 8 says and the voice
[8:03] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[8:05] again
[8:06] and said go and take the little book
[8:09] which is open
[8:11] which is open that's the key we know
[8:13] that in revelation chapter 5 it was
[8:15] closed
[8:16] but who opened it jesus christ the lamb
[8:18] amen now that lamb is a lion amen and
[8:22] and
[8:23] and then he came here at the beginning
[8:24] of this chapter with an open book in
[8:26] verse 1. but it says here go and take
[8:29] the little book which is open in the
[8:31] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[8:34] the sea and upon the earth
[8:36] and i
[8:37] being john here and i went unto the
[8:39] angel and said unto him
[8:41] give me the little book
[8:43] and see that's what we do amen
[8:46] but he said unto me take it
[8:49] take it and eat it up and it shall make
[8:52] thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[8:55] mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[8:57] little book out of the angel's hand and
[9:00] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[9:02] as honey and as soon as i had eaten it
[9:06] my belly was bitter and then verse 11
[9:10] which was kind of interesting that verse
[9:12] 11
[9:13] it's the number 11 and and what hour are
[9:15] we living in in this hour
[9:18] we are we are 11th hour people
[9:20] and this is verse 11.
[9:22] so this got to be us talking about us
[9:25] and he said unto me thou must thou must
[9:27] prophesy
[9:29] which the word prophesy there is like
[9:30] preach
[9:32] right
[9:32] now i must prophesy again before many
[9:35] peoples
[9:36] and nations and tongues and kings amen
[9:40] so
[9:41] that to me right there just tells me
[9:43] that missionary work is to continue to
[9:45] continue going on
[9:47] it doesn't stop right amen and even if
[9:49] it's just mission work amen if you even
[9:51] if you're just preaching to your
[9:52] neighbor you're still doing mission work
[9:54] amen so let's just go to the lord in
[9:56] prayer heavenly father we thank you once
[9:58] again for the opportunity to serve you
[10:00] in this hour thank you lord for the
[10:02] reading of your word blessed father god
[10:04] may you continue to be with the needs
[10:06] that are there amongst us father lord
[10:08] many many needs father but lord you know
[10:10] all about them and you knew them before
[10:12] the foundation of the world we thank you
[10:15] father we commit the service into your
[10:16] hands now and we pray in the name of the
[10:18] lord jesus christ amen lord bless you
[10:23] amen
[10:27] so i appreciate each and every one of
[10:29] you all for praying
[10:30] for us on this trip we left november the
[10:33] 30th goodness it seems like it was
[10:35] yesterday when we left
[10:37] took a
[10:38] took a vehicle
[10:40] and
[10:41] got to the airport everything went
[10:43] smooth no problems thank god
[10:45] and
[10:46] we were out for a total about seven
[10:49] weeks
[10:50] [Music]
[10:52] ministered ministered about 41 times in
[10:55] seven weeks
[10:57] so the equivalent of we did the
[11:00] calculation i forgot how much
[11:04] pretty much i preached what i would
[11:05] preach in about two to three months here
[11:09] i preached it in seven in seven weeks
[11:12] would have been about 43 44 service or
[11:16] times but
[11:17] there was a few times where i had gotten
[11:19] sick and i couldn't preach and and there
[11:21] were some other different arrangements
[11:23] that had to take place but
[11:24] god was still with us amen
[11:27] now all the out of all of those 41 times
[11:29] all of them were not services at church
[11:32] there were some times where i had
[11:34] preached on the radio
[11:35] uh they took me to a a tv station to
[11:38] preach as well so i was live on tv in
[11:41] honduras
[11:42] uh they have some brothers there have a
[11:44] tv program and uh they uh so i was on
[11:48] i preached there for an hour and uh
[11:51] but i mean it's just like preaching i
[11:52] mean you get into it i mean you're just
[11:55] preaching and then two of those times as
[11:57] well i was i was interpreting for a a
[12:00] brother here from the united states
[12:02] brother david nash
[12:03] who was there helping preaching the
[12:06] youth camp that we were ministering at
[12:08] there in honduras
[12:09] so um
[12:11] so
[12:12] lord helped us and uh protected us
[12:15] nothing nothing really uh
[12:18] um
[12:19] you know hurt us as far as uh
[12:22] you know
[12:23] any major things you know to take place
[12:25] you know we got we got sick a few times
[12:27] fever
[12:28] uh my wife about her cut her finger off
[12:31] but uh
[12:33] but uh
[12:35] god uh healed that finger already so
[12:38] and
[12:40] [Applause]
[12:43] and a few little things here and there
[12:46] but the lord was with us overall
[12:48] and i could see i could see you know and
[12:50] i'm going to come to the to the pictures
[12:52] and videos but i could really see the
[12:55] hand of the lord
[12:56] throughout this trip my whole purpose
[12:58] for this trip was
[13:00] throughout the years there have been
[13:01] several invitations for me to go
[13:04] and also to help uh hold uh youth camps
[13:07] in in uh in different places
[13:10] of course when 2020 came in and uh we
[13:13] never got to go
[13:14] and so
[13:16] a lot of those uh invitations were being
[13:18] stacked
[13:20] and
[13:21] so there was different plans that i had
[13:23] made with with several of the brethren
[13:25] down there and
[13:27] so we wanted to fulfill those plans we
[13:29] wanted to to do that
[13:32] and and one of the main things that i
[13:34] wanted to do was uh visit uh some of
[13:36] these little places
[13:38] that uh churches
[13:39] that don't hardly ever get visited as a
[13:42] matter of fact in one of them
[13:45] and one of the places that we visited in
[13:47] honduras
[13:48] they have never had a minister or a
[13:52] preacher from outside of honduras visit
[13:54] them
[13:55] at all
[13:57] hardly anybody even even in honduras
[13:59] knew that that church existed
[14:02] and so i per supposedly i was the first
[14:05] person from the united states to go
[14:06] visit that church
[14:08] and so they were they were very very
[14:10] they were so thankful you know to
[14:12] to to
[14:13] that you know for you to have taken your
[14:15] time to go visit visit them the pastor
[14:18] he's been pastoring there since 1974
[14:21] or 76 something like that just almost
[14:24] just as long as brother dale has been
[14:25] pastoring
[14:26] and he's uh he's 60 something years old
[14:30] and uh he's uh i'll show you the
[14:32] pictures later but he he's the song
[14:34] leader there
[14:35] he takes up the offering he preaches
[14:38] uh he's the deacon he's everything he
[14:41] has hardly no help whatsoever the
[14:44] majority of the of the people that go to
[14:45] his church are are sisters and he only
[14:48] has like two or three men there that so
[14:50] he does just about everything and he's
[14:52] been like that since 1970 something
[14:55] so
[14:57] and so uh you know just for you to just
[14:59] stop by to just to see him so
[15:01] uh the brother the local the brother
[15:03] that took me up that way um they're
[15:05] start they're starting to try to get
[15:07] more fellowship with him now and with
[15:09] that church so that there can be a you
[15:11] know a better connection and get you
[15:14] know more ministers coming in there to
[15:16] help them out but if we had not gone
[15:18] there to visit them
[15:20] that wouldn't have been that wouldn't
[15:22] have been done
[15:23] and so we just thank god for that but i
[15:26] wanna i wanna see if if wanna start off
[15:29] maybe if bella could come and uh she
[15:31] wants she
[15:33] gonna testify zoe do you wanna come with
[15:34] bella
[15:37] you can stand here
[15:38] no okay all right so they just come
[15:40] bella
[15:41] and she has a few words
[15:57] um
[15:58] so first off i'd really like to thank
[16:00] poppy and nanny for letting us go
[16:01] brother wade thank you for letting us go
[16:03] it was truly an amazing experience
[16:06] um
[16:07] our
[16:08] uh our main objective
[16:10] of this trip was to of course win souls
[16:13] to the kingdom of god
[16:14] teach people about the lord
[16:17] but one thing that i definitely kept in
[16:20] mind the entire trip was once i got
[16:21] there i was no longer american
[16:23] i became part of these people
[16:26] i wanted to
[16:28] i didn't want to be treated as if i were
[16:29] this
[16:30] sort of royalty i wanted to be treated
[16:32] as if i had lived there my entire life
[16:35] and i think that having that kind of
[16:36] mentality really helps shape what
[16:38] happens during this trip
[16:41] and so during this entire trip i really
[16:44] wanted to bond with the people to
[16:45] understand them to learn how they lived
[16:47] and it is very obvious that the way they
[16:50] live is completely different to how we
[16:52] live and you'll soon notice that in the
[16:53] pictures
[16:54] um but even though they don't have all
[16:57] of the commodities that we have here at
[17:00] home
[17:00] and everything that helps us be
[17:02] comfortable
[17:04] they are still genuinely happy
[17:07] and they don't there are homes that i've
[17:09] been to that don't even have electricity
[17:12] and yet there they are
[17:14] still smiling and thanking god for
[17:16] everything they have and i thought that
[17:18] was quite amazing
[17:19] um
[17:21] i was able to meet multiple people
[17:24] multiple youth
[17:25] i made many friends that i love and
[17:28] cherish and
[17:30] they send greetings to all of you
[17:32] um they were so excited
[17:35] to know that i spoke spanish because
[17:37] they thought that would be a problem
[17:39] and for a while they they didn't talk to
[17:42] me but once that wall was taken down i
[17:45] was able to create relations with them
[17:47] their families and get to know them and
[17:49] they are such wonderful people and i
[17:52] think that if you were to meet them you
[17:53] would just get along with them so well
[17:55] and i just felt at home
[17:58] i did get an a small injury i got a burn
[18:01] um while helping repair a sister's stove
[18:05] and it took a while to heal up but
[18:07] thankfully i just have a scar there it's
[18:09] completely gone
[18:10] um
[18:11] i think that i've been able to really
[18:14] open up my perspective throughout this
[18:16] trip and i'm really glad i was able to
[18:18] go
[18:19] the lord really worked through this trip
[18:21] and i think that it was definitely
[18:23] something that really will
[18:25] never that i i'll never be able to
[18:27] forget
[18:28] um just before i finish there are a few
[18:31] things that i think i definitely missed
[18:35] um due to the difference in um
[18:38] how how different their lives were
[18:42] one
[18:43] i think one thing that i definitely
[18:45] missed was high-speed wi-fi
[18:51] we rarely ever had high-speed wi-fi so
[18:53] we were all kind of
[18:55] connected to this one hot spot that
[18:57] ended up cutting off for a good four
[18:59] weeks
[19:01] and we were surviving on
[19:04] very slow internet so
[19:06] that was great
[19:09] that made school much easier
[19:11] um
[19:12] i think another thing that i also missed
[19:14] was um
[19:15] flushing toilets and i know that seems
[19:18] very outlandish but
[19:20] it was something that i did miss
[19:23] dragging water up and down all the time
[19:25] was just very
[19:26] uncomfortable but i gained some strength
[19:29] that i did not have when i left
[19:35] i
[19:36] just air conditioning in general just
[19:38] the things that i have here at home that
[19:40] i never noticed before
[19:42] um but most of all i think we missed you
[19:45] all you guys are all our family we see
[19:48] all of you as our aunts uncles cousins
[19:51] brothers and sisters most of all
[19:54] and i think that
[19:56] we're so glad to be back home even
[19:58] though it was such an amazing trip and
[20:01] it was such a great experience
[20:03] there's really no place like home god
[20:05] bless you
[20:14] thank you bella
[20:15] appreciate that
[20:17] yes i could say that i miss one of the
[20:20] things i miss is flushing toilets as
[20:22] well
[20:23] i tell you what saints uh you know it's
[20:26] it and i know some of you older saints
[20:27] you all had the how out houses here at
[20:29] one point and everything like that but
[20:31] people over there still live that way i
[20:33] mean you have to go to an outhouse to go
[20:35] to the toilet and i mean you just see
[20:37] that hole in the ground and that's it
[20:39] you got that steam coming up and
[20:42] and
[20:44] it's not it's not fun
[20:45] [Laughter]
[20:47] but uh but if you did see you know in
[20:50] some places and i'll show here in just a
[20:52] moment you if they if you if you could
[20:53] just at least go in the now house and
[20:55] there's a little commode there even if
[20:57] it doesn't flush
[20:58] i mean the kimono might be wet and stuff
[21:00] and things like that man that was
[21:02] wonderful
[21:03] because you could at least you know you
[21:05] could at least you know take a bucket
[21:07] and flush that way you know
[21:09] but i mean you can't do anything with a
[21:11] hole in the ground
[21:12] [Laughter]
[21:14] in several places it had to be that way
[21:16] there was no other option but
[21:18] um so it's just the things that we take
[21:21] for granted you know things that we take
[21:23] for granted
[21:24] and uh and to them it's just a normal
[21:26] thing you know it's just everyday life
[21:28] you know this is how we live this is how
[21:30] it is
[21:31] so it's awesome to see like she said to
[21:33] see both sides of the world because both
[21:35] sides of the spectrum because it helps
[21:37] you to be i guess be more thankful you
[21:40] know
[21:40] helps you be more thankful so if the
[21:42] brother can bring up the first
[21:45] uh picture and
[21:47] i'm just going to give you all a warning

[21:56] going to get done with this this is only

[22:02] another time
[22:04] um
[22:05] of the rest of the trip
[22:07] but um

[23:59] honduras
[24:01] we we left uh november 30th we left at
[24:04] uh
[24:05] around uh
[24:06] i forgot what time we left
[24:09] it was real early in the morning and we
[24:10] got there around noon and uh so we were
[24:13] very hungry and so that is uh brothers
[24:16] took us to eat some fish
[24:18] and plantains and it was quickly
[24:20] devoured
[24:22] uh
[24:23] you know this restaurant where they took
[24:25] us you know you you would see the rats
[24:27] you know while crawling up in the
[24:29] up in the rafters and stuff
[24:31] and the roaches
[24:32] but that didn't matter that doesn't
[24:34] matter when you're hungry
[24:38] yeah
[24:40] it doesn't matter where you're hungry i
[24:42] don't know
[24:43] where they even had that fish but when
[24:44] you're hungry you're hungry next
[24:49] we just prayed over it listen that's why
[24:51] we pray for our food right
[24:53] all right let's pray for our food now
[24:55] this is uh this right here on the on all
[24:58] the way up to the right that's brother
[24:59] eric brother eric gaggio this is his
[25:02] wife sister rebecca this is their son
[25:04] this is a brother from their church
[25:06] brother eric is the brother that we help
[25:08] support here and that we've sent do you
[25:09] remember when we sent money for the
[25:10] truck the tires that's that that's
[25:13] brother eric he's the one that picked us
[25:14] up from the airport and um
[25:17] pretty much um
[25:19] he took us many of the different places
[25:21] where we went and uh but he is a pastor
[25:24] there
[25:25] um in in talanga uh honduras
[25:28] and
[25:29] now he's taking over a a another church
[25:32] there where the pastor had had left and
[25:35] uh so now he's uh
[25:38] i could tell you know you pray for him
[25:40] because the the the work there has
[25:42] become very stressful you know for him
[25:44] you know and uh but he's
[25:48] his heart for the people is is so great
[25:50] i mean the way he deals with the people
[25:53] um you can tell that he's he's you know
[25:55] he's stressed but yeah he doesn't show
[25:57] it
[25:58] i mean
[25:59] he just tells me you know hey listen i'm
[26:01] dealing with this you know you just pray
[26:02] for me but but he still you know just
[26:05] just doesn't show it and just tries
[26:07] and i guess that's part of being a
[26:09] pastor i mean brother dale would know
[26:11] and uh
[26:13] you know dealing with people isn't easy
[26:16] they all come with different walks of
[26:18] life and they have the same battles
[26:20] there that we do here so
[26:22] next
[26:24] there we are uh this at the place where
[26:26] we were eating at the restaurant this is
[26:28] one of the lakes there's a big lake over
[26:30] there and uh as i forget the name of the
[26:33] lake uh i can't remember the name of the
[26:35] lake right now
[26:37] next
[26:39] all right that's that's the lake over
[26:41] there
[26:42] um
[26:44] and just right below here are there are
[26:46] the rats
[26:47] next
[26:49] and the cockroaches too bell and zoey
[26:52] with
[26:53] the fish next
[26:58] all right
[26:59] so
[27:01] the um
[27:03] the when we got there november 30th on
[27:05] december the 1st
[27:07] uh is when we started uh the the the
[27:10] youth camp that we were going to have
[27:11] brother eric was holding a youth camp
[27:13] and uh it was going to be a four or five
[27:15] day youth camp
[27:17] and uh
[27:18] it's this is this is his church
[27:20] this is his church there the first
[27:22] service we started it was on a wednesday
[27:24] night we started the service there
[27:26] brother david nash preached and uh and
[27:28] actually we started back uh the the uh
[27:31] on
[27:32] on wednesday we started at the youth at
[27:34] the youth ground but this was thursday
[27:37] um
[27:38] and um
[27:39] and so we started at his church and uh i
[27:42] think this is i don't know if this is a
[27:44] video oh no this is a picture
[27:46] next several uh uh several people from
[27:49] around
[27:51] the the country came to in support of
[27:53] that youth camp
[27:55] [Applause]
[28:01] brother david nash i believe he's from
[28:03] washington state
[28:05] and he's uh he's a he's a pastor over
[28:08] there
[28:13] [Music]
[28:18] [Music]
[28:23] okay so this right here is where we
[28:25] actually held the youth the youth camp
[28:27] the youth event
[28:28] and
[28:29] what happened is brother eric this is a
[28:31] school that he works at uh he pastors
[28:34] but he also works he's a teacher at us
[28:36] at a school
[28:37] and they let him uh have that place the
[28:40] the this is their courtyard the school's
[28:43] court courtyard and they let them have
[28:45] that place for a very very cheap amount
[28:49] i mean extremely extremely affordable
[28:52] and so this was the
[28:54] first uh
[28:55] service or second service
[28:57] there at that at that campground or that
[29:00] that area next
[29:04] all right here's some of the sisters
[29:06] they were working feeding uh
[29:08] i would say probably
[29:10] i would say i would say maybe about 200
[29:13] 200 youth came out
[29:16] from different places and the sisters
[29:18] were very hard at work and constantly
[29:20] fixing meals for them because it was it
[29:23] was uh
[29:24] three services a day
[29:26] and so
[29:28] pretty much
[29:29] they would eat almost just about after
[29:31] every service so
[29:33] next
[29:38] there's zoe and and me
[29:41] next
[29:45] and there's christine she's helping the
[29:48] them cook this is where she had cut her
[29:50] finger
[29:51] so i thought about i don't know what you
[29:52] were that you were trying to cut
[29:54] sweetheart and she cut part of her her
[29:57] finger
[29:58] and uh
[29:59] she did a pretty good
[30:01] good cut on there and she said that
[30:03] thing it just just just like fleshed i
[30:06] mean just cut right through the flesh
[30:08] and
[30:08] but she's much better now thank god next
[30:15] all right next
[30:19] all right this right here is sister
[30:21] edie's
[30:22] little sister edis has a a a tremendous
[30:25] testimony
[30:26] she's um
[30:28] she she was really
[30:30] she was really wanting to have um she
[30:32] has she she has a daughter who's 10
[30:34] years she's 10 years old but she really
[30:36] wants a boy
[30:38] so she had asked us ministers you know
[30:40] to pray for her and she's believing that
[30:42] god's going to you know give her a boy
[30:44] and that
[30:45] because they told her that i believe
[30:47] they've told her that she's had or her
[30:48] her husband has problems you know for
[30:51] them to be able to conceive again so
[30:54] but she has a background where her mom
[30:56] left her when she was 15 years old
[30:59] and she became pretty much a street girl
[31:02] and
[31:03] she's had uh in her testimony she tells
[31:05] about having a man she's chasing her
[31:08] down the street wanting to rape her and
[31:11] if there wasn't for some police that she
[31:13] saw there there would have been no
[31:14] telling what would have happened to her
[31:16] she used to work in a landfill and
[31:20] she has seen
[31:21] in the landfill where
[31:23] they've come upon
[31:25] bags and there'd be dead babies in the
[31:27] bags
[31:29] one of the worst ones they found was a
[31:31] big bag
[31:32] and
[31:33] it was about a eight-year-old a
[31:35] nine-year-old girl that was in the bag
[31:37] and so people just they commit
[31:40] do atrocious things and they just throw
[31:42] them out in the landfill you know and
[31:44] they come so she was telling me about
[31:45] that her testimony and and through that
[31:48] through those things that she was seeing
[31:50] as she was growing up um she wasn't
[31:53] serving the lord at that time but it
[31:54] made her think she said when i have a
[31:57] when i have a child i'm not to do that
[32:00] i'm going to keep the child i'm going to
[32:01] keep the child because she she her first
[32:04] child was with a person that wasn't
[32:07] he he impregnated her and left her i
[32:09] think he lives here in the states now
[32:11] somewhere but never never has seen the
[32:14] girl as far as i know
[32:15] and um
[32:17] and she said she said she had a choice
[32:19] to keep the child or not and she decided
[32:22] to keep the little girl
[32:23] and the little girl's 10 years old now
[32:25] we gave her some a little offering money
[32:28] because she said she wanted to buy her
[32:30] little girl a new dress
[32:32] and so some of that money that that you
[32:35] all provided which we thank you all for
[32:38] uh helped her buy her a little dress i
[32:40] think some shoes and things like that
[32:42] and uh we gave her actually a little bit
[32:44] more
[32:45] and she was really thankful for that so
[32:48] y'all pray for sister eddie's
[32:50] next
[32:57] all right this is uh that's brother eric
[32:59] on the on the right me brother ely uh
[33:03] and brother allen brother alan he's from
[33:04] nicaragua
[33:06] uh and the other two brothers they're in
[33:08] honduras we're out they're all ministers
[33:10] uh
[33:11] pastor brother eric and these these
[33:13] brothers do mission work so they're very
[33:16] in tune with the areas that we went to
[33:18] um
[33:19] just young brothers you know and that's
[33:22] that's what they do you know just
[33:24] evangelism and mission work next
[33:31] all right and so here's again um
[33:35] one of the days there at the youth camp
[33:37] and i was there interpreting for brother
[33:39] david nash next
[33:44] this is me uh now
[33:46] preaching on
[33:47] the first time i was preaching here at
[33:49] the youth
[33:54] brother dale everywhere we went your
[33:55] greetings went to everybody
[33:57] [Music]
[33:58] we always made sure that brother dale
[34:01] brother samuel dale sends his greetings
[34:03] and the church in lula georgia since
[34:05] their greetings and they always send
[34:07] their greetings back
[34:09] so so what you do is we tell them how
[34:11] many sentences are greetings back and
[34:13] they're like amen so
[34:15] all those amens come back to you all
[34:18] as a matter of fact i was in there and
[34:19] one of the brothers was telling me
[34:21] please tell please tell the church we
[34:23] say hello and lord bless you all so next
[34:31] this is one of the evenings
[34:34] [Music]
[34:36] is playing the violin
[34:39] [Music]
[34:48] very talented musicians and the majority
[34:50] of them are young people
[34:53] [Music]
[35:14] something's happening i don't remember
[35:16] what this one was
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] next
[35:25] all right so this is uh one of the
[35:28] altar calls
[35:30] and uh so we would just go up front
[35:33] several young people that would go up
[35:35] after services and they wanted to accept
[35:37] the lord
[35:38] uh wanted the holy ghost and so we would
[35:41] just pray with them you know and uh
[35:45] and uh
[35:46] and
[35:47] my whole point with them is because
[35:49] i wanted them when i would pray for them
[35:51] and i would explain to them listen
[35:54] don't don't come up and then come back
[35:56] again tomorrow night and and you know
[35:59] take what's yours now
[36:01] god wants to give it to you
[36:03] so just just just receive it it's yours
[36:06] and that was that was my whole point
[36:08] that i was trying to get across to them
[36:11] um that that because they feel like they
[36:14] they have to do that it's like they feel
[36:16] like they have to put some part of it in
[36:18] themselves in order to appease god
[36:22] it's almost like a catholic mentality
[36:24] and uh but when you give them the word
[36:27] and tell them that god is a god of now
[36:29] you know that god wants to give it to
[36:32] you
[36:32] more than even what you're asking for
[36:35] you know he it's already there for you
[36:37] he's already done it then it gives them
[36:39] a a sense of of liberty you know
[36:42] and so
[36:43] next
[36:50] there's some of the young people
[36:52] worshiping
[36:54] next
[36:57] [Music]
[36:58] this is some of the young brothers
[37:01] after one of the services
[37:02] [Music]
[37:05] and they were always playing the guitar
[37:08] singing

[37:37] washington state and uh she studied
[37:39] spanish

[37:44] on one of the nights uh i think it was
[37:46] the last night of the of the of that
[37:48] youth event they had me go up with her
[37:51] because she wanted to give a testimony
[37:53] and how and she wanted to thank
[37:54] everybody

[38:08] it in spanish and
[38:09] i didn't have to interpret not one thing

[38:18] much god bless you all and i just stood
[38:19] there with the microphone in my hand
[38:21] and then i just looked at the
[38:23] congregation and i just said
[38:25] [Laughter]
[38:29] and uh so she did a really good job
[38:32] next
[38:37] all right this right here is bella and
[38:39] zoe
[38:40] uh
[38:41] singing the special
[38:44] um
[38:45] [Music]

[38:55] singing it in spanish
[38:58] [Music]
[39:10] is
[39:11] [Music]
[39:17] okay
[39:18] next
[39:22] all right here's some of the sisters
[39:23] they got their hair nets
[39:25] on
[39:27] christine
[39:28] it looks good on her doesn't it
[39:33] [Laughter]
[39:37] they're just busy they were they were
[39:38] constantly the sisters didn't really
[39:40] even get to to go to the to the
[39:43] the services because uh they're just
[39:45] constantly there cooking for the young
[39:48] people next
[39:50] after the after the event they were go
[39:52] ahead bro after the event they
[39:54] were uh
[39:57] properly acknowledged you know
[39:59] because they it couldn't be done without
[40:01] them either
[40:04] this is christine she would gather a lot
[40:06] of the young people and they would sing
[40:08] specials together
[40:10] and
[40:12] so they're here they're singing to god
[40:14] be the glory
[40:16] [Music]
[40:27] [Music]
[40:35] next
[40:39] y'all know that christine could sing in
[40:40] spanish
[40:43] she surprises me too
[40:46] there's some of the brothers uh they're
[40:48] just
[40:49] working hard they're at the event next
[40:53] all right and here's some of the places
[40:54] where they slept
[40:56] they didn't have nice bunk beds
[40:59] they just had little mattresses one one
[41:01] thing that
[41:03] that was requested is that they want to
[41:06] be able to
[41:07] use the same uh
[41:09] what they do is throughout all the uh
[41:12] youth events that they have in honduras
[41:13] they use those same
[41:15] little mattresses
[41:17] everywhere everywhere they go and so
[41:19] this this this cover for the mattresses
[41:21] is coming off and a lot of them
[41:23] and so uh
[41:25] they were requesting a donation you know
[41:28] if we wanted to help get the the covers
[41:32] back on them because they want to keep
[41:34] using the same mattresses
[41:36] and so since the mattresses are still in
[41:38] good condition they can just still use
[41:40] them but just have new covers on over
[41:42] them so that was a request and and so a
[41:45] lot of the churches there are helping
[41:47] pitch in
[41:48] to get this going
[41:51] for these events next
[41:57] all right this is me um
[42:04] sunday uh sunday morning which was the
[42:06] last service of the meeting
[42:09] uh the last service of the meeting
[42:10] [Music]
[42:14] we were
[42:16] i was trying to explain to them how god
[42:19] comes to our left he comes down to our
[42:21] level
[42:22] and how
[42:24] we don't have to be afraid you know and
[42:26] i was given an example of of a of a
[42:29] young brother
[42:30] a brother there who's while i was in the
[42:32] truck you can pause it for a moment i
[42:34] was there in the truck studying and just
[42:36] kind of looking over what i was going to
[42:37] preach i was preaching about now we are
[42:39] the sons of god
[42:41] and
[42:41] and i looked over to my right and i saw
[42:44] this this brother whose son
[42:47] he did something he hurt himself and he
[42:49] went he was crying and he went running
[42:51] to his dad
[42:53] and his dad what his dad did is uh he
[42:56] didn't ask him what's going on what
[42:57] happened what's wrong what he did is he
[42:59] got down to to his son and just kind of
[43:01] hugged him
[43:02] didn't ask him he just his first
[43:04] instinct was to just comfort him
[43:07] and as i was there in the truck i was
[43:08] thinking my goodness that's what god
[43:10] does to us you know he doesn't scold us
[43:13] he doesn't
[43:14] you know when you come to god and you've
[43:16] been you lost in your ways you know what
[43:19] he does is he come he came down to our
[43:21] level even when he came here on earth he
[43:24] came down to your level and that's what
[43:26] the bible says see to experience what it
[43:28] was so that he can be the high priest
[43:30] that can be touched by the feeling of
[43:32] your infirmities
[43:33] and so he experienced everything that
[43:35] you and i experience and he understands
[43:38] and so that's what i was trying to
[43:40] explain get get across to them
[43:42] and uh
[43:44] to see the young people these young
[43:47] people when you preach to them
[43:49] the simplicity of the gospel the
[43:51] simplicity of what is the new birth the
[43:54] simplicity of being birth uh born again
[43:57] uh because the the way it's preached to
[44:00] them it's it it's because it just gets
[44:03] very difficult they they they it becomes
[44:06] almost like do's and don'ts and and
[44:08] that's all they hear and they get
[44:09] slammed on top of the head
[44:11] uh conked on top of the head a lot you
[44:14] know by the way they live and by the way
[44:16] they act and when and then when you
[44:18] bring it out and it it from the
[44:20] scripture of what it is to be born again
[44:23] and what it is to receive the holy
[44:24] spirit and it all goes back to the word
[44:28] a lot of them was like wow i've never
[44:30] heard that before
[44:32] so they were really really really
[44:34] touched by that and uh i believe they
[44:37] that some of them i think god revealed
[44:39] the word to them and
[44:41] by some by some of the things that was
[44:43] expressed to me next
[44:52] [Music]
[45:01] about how the bride is to do the is the
[45:04] voice
[45:05] uh in this last stage and and and how
[45:09] she's to do the works there was a work
[45:10] left for us to do in this hour
[45:13] next
[45:18] all right
[45:20] so
[45:21] um
[45:22] this right here is where the uh
[45:25] the youth camp was held at
[45:27] um
[45:28] around around around this area and so
[45:31] that's why i wanted to put the the map
[45:32] up
[45:33] uh as we're going through the images and
[45:35] videos and then i'll i'll i'll interlace
[45:38] this map through there so that you can
[45:40] see
[45:41] where we were at and where where the
[45:42] events took place next
[45:49] right now we are in
[45:51] on the
[45:52] road to
[45:54] catacamas
[45:56] or
[45:57] area in an area called holancha
[46:00] this is our
[46:02] our precious brother
[46:05] he's a missionary and uh evangelist here
[46:08] in the
[46:09] in the country
[46:11] a wonderful brother
[46:13] there's christine
[46:15] that's his wife
[46:18] brother lee's wife sister lily
[46:20] she's been holding her little baby there
[46:22] there's
[46:23] valenzuela's asleep
[46:31] [Music]
[46:38] i wanted to put these in here so that
[46:40] you all understand this is how we pretty
[46:42] much would ride everywhere we would go
[46:44] just crammed in there they they would
[46:46] they would uh try to take the most of
[46:49] every
[46:50] space available and try to take as many
[46:52] people with them as possible wherever so
[46:54] this is where we were riding
[46:56] we were riding to catacamas
[46:58] um
[47:00] um which was on the on the eastern part
[47:03] of honduras there on the map
[47:05] and uh next
[47:11] all right and this it was about a it was
[47:13] about a two-hour drive from from the
[47:15] from talanga where where the youth
[47:17] meeting was held and then now we arrived
[47:20] that evening and we were hungry so we
[47:22] were looking for somewhere to eat
[47:24] and as we were there like the lights
[47:26] just go out the the lights in the city
[47:29] just go off randomly and so it just it
[47:32] was it was you see how nice and bright
[47:33] it is there right now but then all of a
[47:35] sudden
[47:36] power was out and people were like oh
[47:39] the power went out again
[47:40] [Laughter]
[47:42] but they know that in about 20 30
[47:44] minutes it'll come back and so
[47:46] power came back and then you start
[47:48] hearing the generators running
[47:50] everywhere next
[47:59] i'm not sure what this what happened
[48:01] here what this is next
[48:07] all right so the next day is when we
[48:11] were uh
[48:13] this this is where christine and the
[48:15] girls stayed
[48:16] this is the brethren that we were we
[48:19] made plans to go up to the mountains up
[48:22] in an area called
[48:24] los angeles really is what it's called i
[48:26] would tell the brethren and joke with
[48:28] them that you know we have los angeles
[48:30] too and they know that i said but now
[48:33] this is a holy los angeles this is much
[48:36] the one we have over there is completely
[48:38] uh
[48:39] it's gone
[48:41] and uh but
[48:42] and they would just laugh about that and
[48:44] of course you know that's where we get
[48:46] hollywood and stuff but see these are
[48:48] some of the brethren that went up next
[48:54] all right this is about now
[48:56] to
[48:57] los angeles la florida
[49:01] brothers are
[49:04] packing up this is about five in the
[49:06] morning
[49:07] and uh
[49:09] about five and we're gonna head on out
[49:11] next
[49:16] all right so we went up and met some of
[49:18] some some more people there from brother
[49:21] uh from the church one of the churches
[49:23] there some of the sisters
[49:25] uh that they were going up as well and
[49:28] from this point right here where we were
[49:30] at to where we were going to our
[49:32] destination up in the mountains it was
[49:34] about a four hour hike
[49:36] this is as far as the cars can come the
[49:39] rest of it was going to be a trek on
[49:41] foot
[49:42] next
[49:48] this is one of some of just some of the
[49:50] places uh
[49:52] heading up there next kind of looks like
[49:54] some of the areas up here in the
[49:55] mountains
[50:07] supposedly this is the horse i'm gonna
[50:09] be riding
[50:10] [Laughter]
[50:15] i almost felt like we were one of those
[50:16] caravans coming into the united states
[50:18] you know from honduras
[50:24] they had the baby
[50:25] on
[50:28] and this is kind of 30 minutes into uh
[50:30] already uh us walking next
[50:33] just 35
[50:35] we just met up with brother nathan
[50:37] so we met up with the pastor that we
[50:38] were going to go up he came down as we
[50:41] were coming up and we met a certain way
[50:43] and he was he brought down the horses
[50:45] horses and and uh
[50:47] and so what they're doing and so uh
[50:51] what they're doing is they're taking our
[50:53] bags and they're putting them in big
[50:54] sacks
[50:56] and they're tying these sacks on the
[50:57] side on the sides of the horses so
[50:59] they'd be easier for us to get up there
[51:03] you can see that's what they're doing
[51:04] there this is brother natividad he's the
[51:06] pastor up there and he's just he's just
[51:08] a rancher he's just a farmer
[51:10] wonderful brother next
[51:15] did you just kind of get this is me on
[51:17] the horse
[51:18] and this is just kind of get a feel of
[51:20] of what it was like going up
[51:25] it was really rocky
[51:28] and honestly i did not even know how
[51:30] even the horse got up got up there
[51:32] carrying
[51:34] 174 pounds on top of his back
[51:38] which was me
[51:40] and
[51:42] where's the poor horse would get tired
[51:43] as well here with the brother there were
[51:45] the times where you'd be riding and and
[51:47] then also he just stops
[51:50] and i'm like
[51:52] and then and then i'd hit it i'd hit it
[51:54] and then he'd go a little bit more and
[51:56] then and then he'd stop again
[51:58] and then he's there and then
[52:00] you'd hit it again and then he just he'd
[52:02] just go
[52:03] you know he'd get upset because you were
[52:04] telling them to move
[52:09] next
[52:10] but we were on i was on horseback for
[52:12] about 45 minutes or so because
[52:13] afterwards my leg was killing me just
[52:15] kind of get a view
[52:19] where we were heading
[52:21] and i'm gonna tell you my legs are
[52:23] killing me right now later on a brother
[52:25] told me that uh
[52:27] that mules do a better job
[52:29] doing this
[52:31] uh so some of the brethren they had they
[52:33] have mules as well but this is what they
[52:35] had provided at the time these horses
[52:38] the horse sound that he normally made
[52:40] but these horses they're very familiar
[52:42] with this way they've already gone up
[52:43] and down two minutes so many times so
[52:47] next
[52:50] all right this is uh
[52:52] now we got there's a little bit easier
[52:54] part just wanted to show y'all some of
[52:56] the views
[52:58] oh it's just beautiful and this is where
[53:01] some of these people live
[53:03] and i would tell them when i would
[53:04] preach to them there'd be people down
[53:06] here you know they would just love to
[53:08] just be able to live there or to at
[53:10] least see this
[53:11] and to them it's just you know it's just
[53:13] normal you know it's just normal life
[53:16] it's
[53:17] hey i i was trying to tell them don't
[53:18] take it for granted
[53:20] there's people down there that would
[53:22] love to be see this uh you can you can
[53:24] turn it up a little bit here
[53:28] i tell you what but
[53:32] if i wanted to lose weight i probably
[53:34] already lost it now
[53:35] [Laughter]
[53:39] this was gonna be this is rougher than
[53:41] what i thought it'd be
[53:43] and
[53:45] i am so glad that
[53:47] christine's bell and zoey
[53:50] did not come
[53:51] on this trip
[53:53] this is a bit tough
[54:01] but it's so beautiful
[54:11] all right
[54:13] all right so this is where we got to our
[54:14] the brother's house for the natividad's
[54:16] uh place
[54:18] and
[54:19] they had uh
[54:21] and they just gave us one just look at
[54:23] they had coffee ready for us
[54:25] oh yeah that's they drink coffee
[54:27] they'd rather drink coffee than water
[54:29] almost you know when you get to those
[54:30] places
[54:32] and they
[54:34] so we were drinking coffee
[54:36] and just kind of show you my boots
[54:41] and you you have to go to those places
[54:44] and this is how you have to walk because
[54:45] this is the reason why
[54:47] how deep this money is
[54:50] if you're not wearing rubber boots
[54:51] you just you can't make it
[54:54] it's hard
[54:59] some of these places you just show you
[55:01] how how deep some of the mud is
[55:04] um freaking through
[55:07] we're gonna
[55:09] we're on our way to have a little
[55:10] service and some of these brethren do
[55:12] this all the time just to go to church
[55:14] up in the uh at home
[55:16] just just to go to church they do this
[55:19] every sunday
[55:20] every time they have service well we
[55:22] have to cross through
[55:23] and uh
[55:25] lord bless them for it
[55:27] this right here is their current all
[55:29] right so this is uh
[55:31] this is brother natividad's
[55:33] place and uh i i gotta i gotta this is
[55:36] his
[55:36] his current church right here on the
[55:38] left but they're building a new church
[55:40] because this this place uh is it's
[55:43] getting very old they're having to
[55:45] replace a lot of the uh the boards on
[55:47] the church for the space this is this is
[55:49] their new little building that they're
[55:51] that they're building
[55:53] uh and just to let you all know some of
[55:54] your funds went to to go support that
[55:58] um
[55:59] lord willing they might have that
[56:00] building done by march and they're gonna
[56:02] have their uh
[56:04] service to dedicate the the church
[56:07] uh and they're gonna use their old
[56:08] building a place to uh to have when they
[56:11] have big meetings you know and they have
[56:13] place to to for people to rest to sleep
[56:16] and things like that
[56:17] but um
[56:18] this is uh this is their current church
[56:20] right now some of some of you all uh
[56:23] helped uh with the efforts for this
[56:26] church and the brother natividad was
[56:28] very thankful for that
[56:30] all right next
[56:34] all right this is brother
[56:35] that's the pastor
[56:37] and uh he's carrying a master here i'm
[56:39] not sure what the sack what was inside
[56:41] the sack but
[56:57] uh
[56:59] they what they do as far as electricity
[57:01] up there uh they use solar panels
[57:04] because they don't have electricity
[57:06] running through there that goes up there
[57:08] so what they do is harness electricity
[57:10] through solar panels and um
[57:13] and so
[57:14] um
[57:15] in the solar panels that the the
[57:17] electricity that is gathered it goes to
[57:20] a battery
[57:21] and so the battery it turns on you know
[57:23] their lights at night and things like
[57:25] that they have one for the church and
[57:27] they have one for their homes
[57:30] now the brother he had the brother
[57:32] natividad the battery
[57:34] for the church
[57:36] it went out so they needed a new a new
[57:38] battery
[57:39] so we're in the process right now with
[57:40] some of the funds that you all gave to
[57:42] buy them a new battery right now
[57:44] we're going to be sending them that
[57:46] money here shortly because we gave them
[57:48] part of part of the money while we were
[57:49] over there but then we're going to we're
[57:51] sending the rest of it here
[57:54] back next week actually so
[57:57] so just to get a
[57:59] feel of what pretty much what we would
[58:00] eat this is just
[58:03] chickens from their yard
[58:05] they would always one time
[58:07] you know they
[58:08] they killed eight chickens in their yard
[58:10] just to give us chicken chicken soup
[58:13] and uh
[58:14] looks uh it was really good
[58:17] next
[58:21] all right so
[58:22] after all that long walk four hour four
[58:25] hours walking this is me laying on a
[58:26] hammock
[58:27] and the sister right here she's uh she's
[58:30] actually uh washing coffee beans
[58:32] like they what they do is they grow
[58:34] coffee in the area and they they produce
[58:37] their own coffee they they grow it they
[58:39] they toast it everything the whole
[58:41] process they do it right there and they
[58:43] go back down to the city
[58:45] four or five hours and they sell it and
[58:47] that's how they make some money
[58:49] and then they come back up four or five
[58:50] hours i also wanted to note that the
[58:52] brothers new church all those bricks
[58:55] that you saw
[58:56] there
[58:57] they had they had to be brought from
[58:59] from all that all that way
[59:01] multiple trips that they took so they
[59:04] can build the church so
[59:06] more power to them
[59:08] because i mean
[59:10] that's just become normal to them to
[59:11] just go up and down that that stretch of
[59:14] of
[59:15] through that way
[59:17] next
[59:19] so yeah it's it's nice uh if you if
[59:22] you've never laid on a hammock before oh
[59:24] my it's
[59:25] it's
[59:26] yeah i don't recommend it to sleep all
[59:28] night in a hammock but it's it's a nice
[59:30] just lay there after
[59:32] a long hike this is some of the areas up
[59:35] there next
[59:42] all right here's
[59:43] some horses
[59:46] and just get a little panoramic view
[59:48] of where we were at this is after we
[59:51] left brother natividad's house we were
[59:53] going up to the place where we were
[59:55] actually another brother's house where
[59:56] we were gonna that's where we were gonna
[59:58] be sleeping at
[59:59] and we were going to
[1:00:01] have service this evening further down
[1:00:03] so
[1:00:04] after that long walk they expected me i
[1:00:06] was going to preach that night
[1:00:08] they expected me to preach
[1:00:12] and we did thank god next
[1:00:16] just almost
[1:00:17] all right this is the little house where
[1:00:18] we stayed at this house um
[1:00:24] and this this is the brother
[1:00:25] this is his home he's the assistant he
[1:00:28] has uh
[1:00:29] three daughters and the son of the house
[1:00:32] where we were just and this brother he
[1:00:33] was just going i mean he would stop he
[1:00:36] wouldn't stop and uh and
[1:00:39] wonderful brother it's like he i never
[1:00:41] saw him tired
[1:00:43] my goodness never saw him tired look his
[1:00:46] brother eliakin is his name
[1:00:48] right here
[1:00:53] all right back in the place where we
[1:00:55] left the girls and
[1:00:57] and christine
[1:00:58] they were doing homeschool
[1:01:01] this is zoe uh
[1:01:03] doing some of her work outside
[1:01:05] next
[1:01:12] and some of the
[1:01:13] they would go out and
[1:01:16] next
[1:01:19] here's bella she's doing her school work
[1:01:23] next
[1:01:28] bella helping cook washing dishes
[1:01:30] she's washing dishes
[1:01:32] they don't have running water well uh
[1:01:35] they actually this
[1:01:37] they do here but
[1:01:39] they have to conserve as much water as
[1:01:41] possible
[1:01:42] so they'll put some of that water in a
[1:01:44] pot right
[1:01:45] next
[1:01:50] all right so this is that that same
[1:01:51] evening back in the mountains
[1:01:53] the first service uh we're heading up to
[1:01:56] the to the church
[1:01:58] and uh
[1:02:00] that we're gonna have and
[1:02:02] they were gonna have a whole we're gonna
[1:02:03] hold a three-day campaign three-day
[1:02:06] campaign

[1:02:09] this brother's house
[1:02:10] that they wanted to also
[1:02:12] dedicate
[1:02:13] and so that's where we were heading up
[1:02:15] right here it was probably about a
[1:02:17] 15-minute walk from the house where we
[1:02:19] were staying that i just showed you to
[1:02:21] that place
[1:02:22] next
[1:02:23] but you know you have to go through all
[1:02:25] the mud and
[1:02:26] making sure your bible doesn't doesn't
[1:02:28] fall
[1:02:30] oh this is back down
[1:02:34] vegetables yes
[1:02:36] yeah they they grow beans they grow
[1:02:38] different vegetables as well
[1:02:41] this is zoe she's uh
[1:02:43] these are green beans next
[1:02:49] next
[1:02:54] all right so this is uh the the the
[1:02:56] service that up there in the mountains
[1:02:58] in los angeles
[1:03:01] that first night next
[1:03:03] this is the brother's house
[1:03:06] if you notice there was a brother
[1:03:08] sitting up here in the corner
[1:03:10] after i had preached that night
[1:03:13] that brother had never been around
[1:03:15] message believers before he'd always
[1:03:17] been to
[1:03:18] denominational churches and he was well
[1:03:21] versed in the scriptures
[1:03:23] and
[1:03:24] and and so
[1:03:26] after the service i talked to him
[1:03:28] because i had mentioned about a prophet
[1:03:30] i had mentioned you know i mentioned
[1:03:32] brother branham i mentioned you know god
[1:03:33] sent a prophet in this day and so he
[1:03:36] wanted to know what that was all about
[1:03:38] and so i got to testify about him
[1:03:41] i got to testify the message to him and
[1:03:44] uh gave him a a church age book in
[1:03:46] spanish
[1:03:47] and so we're just trusting that the lord
[1:03:49] is doing the work in his heart because
[1:03:51] he was very well he was very interested
[1:03:54] in in in what was what was being said so
[1:03:58] next
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:24] is i was just telling them you know it's
[1:04:28] you know when you're when your car is is
[1:04:31] broken and when you
[1:04:33] you know it's much better to be serving
[1:04:35] the lord than than having a nice car and
[1:04:37] all these things if you have god in your
[1:04:39] heart
[1:04:40] you know
[1:04:43] next
[1:04:47] all right so this is brother ely
[1:04:49] and so
[1:04:51] the reason why he's holding here two
[1:04:52] phones
[1:04:53] and and we had to get in certain little
[1:04:55] spots just to be able to get some
[1:04:56] signals because this is the brother that
[1:04:58] i would go to the radio station and to
[1:05:00] the tv station to preach with so even
[1:05:03] though we were all the way up there
[1:05:05] what they would do is they would the
[1:05:06] radio station would pipe in to through
[1:05:08] whatsapp
[1:05:10] and so i would preach
[1:05:11] all the way from up there to other areas
[1:05:13] in that in that uh in the general in
[1:05:16] that vicinity and would preach the
[1:05:18] gospel you know for about 30 minutes
[1:05:21] on the phone so
[1:05:23] next
[1:05:28] all right so this is the next day and uh
[1:05:31] we were the brothers made a little tarp
[1:05:33] outside
[1:05:35] and uh we had a service there that
[1:05:37] evening next
[1:05:43] go ahead next brother
[1:05:46] appreciate the brothers in the back
[1:05:49] uh
[1:05:50] i just nice to be able to have the
[1:05:52] service was so nice right there in front
[1:05:54] of that view
[1:05:55] it was beautiful but that night we had a
[1:05:57] lot of rain
[1:05:59] and so a lot of the people that were
[1:06:00] standing outside they had to end up
[1:06:02] coming inside and so we were we were
[1:06:04] crammed in
[1:06:05] and we were still getting wet because i
[1:06:07] mean the the the rain would gut on those
[1:06:09] tarps and they'd get heavy and then just
[1:06:12] so
[1:06:14] it was uh
[1:06:16] next
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:41] all right
[1:06:46] all right this is towards the end of the
[1:06:48] service i didn't preach that night uh
[1:06:50] brother ali had preached that night
[1:06:53] next
[1:06:56] all right back down back back
[1:06:59] back where the girls were at they were
[1:07:00] still washing dishes
[1:07:03] [Laughter]
[1:07:07] next
[1:07:10] and they were
[1:07:11] making them sweet too
[1:07:17] next
[1:07:20] they would also get on on top of tree
[1:07:22] climb trees and pick the fruit that was
[1:07:24] on the trees i don't know exactly what
[1:07:26] the huh jujuga was the name of that
[1:07:29] fruit and it was almost like a small
[1:07:32] pear
[1:07:33] and
[1:07:34] it was good
[1:07:36] zoe fell off that tree
[1:07:37] but she was okay
[1:07:40] all right so one of the mornings here
[1:07:45] we got up i got i got up this is their
[1:07:48] kitchen
[1:07:49] and this is what they had there
[1:07:51] they were gonna have for
[1:07:53] for lunch that that that morning
[1:07:57] they had the chickens already killed
[1:07:59] look at those legs
[1:08:01] it's not like chicken legs here
[1:08:06] those things were that is some tough
[1:08:08] meat
[1:08:09] because them chickens you know they're
[1:08:10] they're they're eating out in the yard
[1:08:12] and everything and so they're they're
[1:08:14] much stronger and and
[1:08:16] no hormones or anything like that
[1:08:19] it was good it was good flavored meat it
[1:08:21] was just much much tougher so if you're
[1:08:24] used to eating kfc you're going to think
[1:08:26] oh my god it's nasty
[1:08:29] but
[1:08:30] it's much healthier i could show you
[1:08:31] that
[1:08:33] all right next
[1:08:36] all right this is back down with
[1:08:38] christine and then we're at they were
[1:08:39] heading uh
[1:08:40] out that day
[1:08:42] uh they were gonna visit uh some people
[1:08:45] and also head to church that evening
[1:08:47] because this was on a wednesday
[1:08:50] you could keep playing it
[1:08:58] just kind of get an idea of what the
[1:09:00] area looked like in the roads
[1:09:05] all right next
[1:09:07] all right this is one of the sisters
[1:09:08] there that they we had fellowship with
[1:09:11] she's gonna get married soon
[1:09:14] next
[1:09:18] it's bella sporting a new hat
[1:09:21] she says she hated this picture but i
[1:09:23] needed to put it in
[1:09:25] [Laughter]
[1:09:28] next
[1:09:32] all right so this is at the sister's
[1:09:34] house this dog apparently loved zoey so
[1:09:36] much she when zoe was leaving that day
[1:09:39] the dog was like going crazy she didn't
[1:09:42] he didn't want her to leave i don't know
[1:09:44] like he took a love for zoe and
[1:09:46] apparently he loves children
[1:09:48] and so
[1:09:50] he was barking and everything i have
[1:09:51] video of that but not here but just
[1:09:53] wanted to point that out i thought that
[1:09:55] was funny next
[1:09:58] all right that night they went to
[1:09:59] service they went to church and the
[1:10:01] brother that i was up with
[1:10:03] up in the mountains brother elie the one
[1:10:05] that was holding the two phones that's
[1:10:07] his dad his dad was preaching there that
[1:10:09] that that evening at the church down in

[1:11:22] like chicken
[1:11:24] this is a rock inside the ground
[1:11:27] this is not a chicken uh chicken leg
[1:11:30] this is a rock and i we were as we were
[1:11:32] walking i happened to uh

[1:11:44] all right
[1:11:48] all right this is the toilet again
[1:11:52] it's like i said that's a beautiful
[1:11:54] sight to me

[1:11:57] went that last night there up in the
[1:11:59] mountains we had um we had a last
[1:12:01] service more people came from different
[1:12:04] places

[1:12:21] and uh gave out a lot of the prayer
[1:12:23] cloths that we have here there
[1:12:26] and so next
[1:12:30] and and you notice that a lot of the a
[1:12:32] lot of just pause it for a moment a lot
[1:12:34] of the
[1:12:34] churches there you know they split the
[1:12:36] sisters they have them sit on one side
[1:12:38] and then the brothers on the other side
[1:12:40] and this
[1:12:41] most of the churches that's how they do
[1:12:43] it
[1:12:44] next
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:49] this is me there in the little study
[1:12:51] getting ready to come out
[1:12:53] and uh
[1:12:55] i was i was
[1:12:56] just right above me there was this light
[1:12:58] because you know a lot of bugs coming to
[1:13:00] the light and everything and there's
[1:13:01] these little uh
[1:13:02] these little bees flying around there
[1:13:05] and i was like hurry up and call me
[1:13:07] because i
[1:13:08] had them little bees flying around me
[1:13:10] and i was doing my best to just stay
[1:13:11] concentrated
[1:13:13] on the on the on the word and what i was
[1:13:15] studying but yeah you had all these
[1:13:16] little bugs uh just flying around next
[1:13:24] all right this is uh me preaching as you
[1:13:26] you can see i'm preaching with my with
[1:13:28] the muddy boots on
[1:13:30] and and that's fine they expect that
[1:13:33] over there you know
[1:13:34] next
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:56] a true faith will help
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:13] are you going to stay with the word
[1:14:18] are you going to stay with what god said
[1:14:20] about you
[1:14:21] or are you just going to just hunker
[1:14:23] down and be a coward
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:41] to the saving of the soul
[1:14:42] all right next
[1:14:46] and then afterwards uh we had
[1:14:49] just me leading songs
[1:14:50] a little song after after preaching
[1:14:54] next
[1:14:59] all right this is brother like eliakin's
[1:15:01] family the brother that we stayed in in
[1:15:03] their house and they send their
[1:15:05] greetings to you all as well
[1:15:07] next
[1:15:08] this brother right here this is his son
[1:15:10] and uh just pause it for a moment that
[1:15:12] that they went to go hunt for uh wild
[1:15:15] hogs
[1:15:16] that that morning and he they just go
[1:15:18] out and hunt wild hogs and deer and
[1:15:20] everything
[1:15:22] and uh and they could not catch a hog
[1:15:24] that day
[1:15:25] but then they they went the following
[1:15:27] day but that was the day that we were
[1:15:28] gonna go we were leaving and they they
[1:15:31] caught a couple of deers so they were
[1:15:32] gonna give us some deer meat from up
[1:15:33] there
[1:15:34] but we never got to eat any but uh
[1:15:38] next
[1:15:40] like i said they they make their own
[1:15:42] coffee
[1:15:43] and so that's then right there toasting
[1:15:44] the coffee beans
[1:15:46] um
[1:15:48] everything they have to do by hand
[1:15:50] she's here
[1:15:55] and then
[1:15:56] you see how it's getting darker and i
[1:15:58] never knew how why coffee beans would
[1:16:00] get dark like that but that's the reason
[1:16:03] why is because because of the toasting
[1:16:05] they put sugar on in it and i asked her
[1:16:08] why did they they do that and she said
[1:16:09] it's it's to give it like a little
[1:16:11] camera a camera lies look to it but it's
[1:16:14] not to sweeten it doesn't make the
[1:16:16] coffee bean sweet
[1:16:18] next
[1:16:21] and then that's them getting ready to
[1:16:23] grind it
[1:16:25] and uh they had me grinding as well
[1:16:28] and uh i don't see how that sister could
[1:16:30] keep i mean that's tough
[1:16:32] it's tough but she's getting ready too
[1:16:35] uh we brought some of that coffee that
[1:16:36] batch right there that she's making
[1:16:38] right there they gave it to me in a bag
[1:16:40] and we brought it and we've been
[1:16:41] drinking it
[1:16:43] next
[1:16:45] you can see how it looks caramelized
[1:16:46] like a little camera that's because of
[1:16:48] the sugar and
[1:16:52] no
[1:16:54] well i mean it is burnt but that's
[1:16:57] that's how that's how they like it
[1:17:00] all right that's the that's brother
[1:17:02] natividad's family this is this is he
[1:17:05] has thir he has 13 children this is just
[1:17:07] only
[1:17:08] this is just only some of them
[1:17:10] you pray for this little boy because the
[1:17:12] other day he uh he he was holding a
[1:17:14] machete and he fell he fell down and the
[1:17:17] machete went over to his eye
[1:17:20] and almost took his eye out he sent me
[1:17:22] the pictures
[1:17:23] but uh but uh
[1:17:25] he's getting better now his eye puffed
[1:17:27] up
[1:17:29] luckily he the the doctor said that he
[1:17:31] he didn't lose his eye so his eyes gonna
[1:17:33] get better but it could have been worse
[1:17:35] than
[1:17:36] hit next
[1:17:38] all right
[1:17:39] now we got it give me another 10 more
[1:17:41] minutes so right now it's about all
[1:17:43] right this is when we were leaving the
[1:17:44] mountain
[1:17:45] and uh and we're walking back down
[1:17:47] trekking back down next evening
[1:17:53] yeah i wanted to show that because if we
[1:17:55] found this horse on their way and and it
[1:17:57] was a what is that called one
[1:18:00] the brandon and the brandon is bella
[1:18:05] so
[1:18:05] i thought that was funny
[1:18:17] actually it's much trickier because now
[1:18:19] you're going down and you can slide much
[1:18:21] much easier
[1:18:22] and so
[1:18:24] uh that has accumulated believe it or
[1:18:26] not i was more sore going down than i
[1:18:28] was going up
[1:18:37] so on the way down we found this this
[1:18:40] little guy and uh i don't know what it's
[1:18:42] called but it
[1:18:43] apparently
[1:18:45] they just fall off the trees and
[1:18:47] hopefully you're you're hoping that no
[1:18:49] nothing
[1:18:50] none of them falls up because if they do
[1:18:52] it's got a really powerful bite but just
[1:18:54] keep playing it
[1:18:58] the brother picks it up on the stick i
[1:19:00] mean look it's feisty
[1:19:05] and it's got like these these red pads
[1:19:08] as as their feet and
[1:19:11] he picks it up
[1:19:12] and he starts showing it to us up close
[1:19:16] and he holds it there and then the
[1:19:18] brother elise like okay all right don't
[1:19:20] get it too close now
[1:19:25] but uh it's pretty but apparently it
[1:19:27] it's got a very powerful bike next
[1:19:34] all right so this is why when we got we
[1:19:36] got home back down to the where
[1:19:39] christine and the girls were staying at
[1:19:40] next
[1:19:45] uh next
[1:19:49] all right
[1:19:50] so then that same day uh we i got
[1:19:53] cleaned up we got cleaned up and uh
[1:19:56] and then quickly we had to leave out to
[1:19:58] go to our next area where we were gonna
[1:19:59] preach
[1:20:01] and that was it it was about an hour and
[1:20:03] a half away in an area called kulmi
[1:20:06] and that's very typical just a lot of
[1:20:09] ranchers there you see a lot of cows

[1:27:15] getting it was in this set of pictures
[1:27:18] we were able to baptize seven people
[1:27:22] originally it was going to be about
[1:27:25] three or four people they were going to
[1:27:26] be baptized but as we were baptizing
[1:27:29] some more people wanted to come and get
[1:27:31] baptized and so
[1:27:32] they it was just we had a wonderful time
[1:27:36] and then before we left before we left
[1:27:38] come to come back home to the states the
[1:27:41] in costa rica two more brothers wanted
[1:27:43] to get baptized
[1:27:45] and we didn't get to baptize them but
[1:27:49] they got that the word touched them so
[1:27:51] much that it led them
[1:27:52] want to want to get baptized they told
[1:27:55] they told
[1:27:56] the pastor there that
[1:27:59] that they were really blessed with the
[1:28:00] word that i had preached there that
[1:28:02] night and it really spoke to their heart
[1:28:04] and it led them to baptism you know they
[1:28:06] wanted to get baptized so there's
[1:28:08] another brother there that's going to be
