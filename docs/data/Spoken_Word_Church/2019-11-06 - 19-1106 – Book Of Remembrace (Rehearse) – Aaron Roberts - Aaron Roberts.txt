the scene you know just like the Hebrew children they were in that fiery furnace in a fiery furnace they stood there and they said you know God may not deliver us but we won't bow right he's more than

things I won't talk about tonight I don't know how this is gonna go but y'all just y'all just pray for me and what's the what's that lead follow or get out of the way so you know I don't I don't know I'm I'm a I'm a jump up and down I'm a shout I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't know what I'm gonna do I may cry I don't know but you know I you know tonight I want to I want to look at something tonight the title of this is called a book of remembrance and and though in the word I want to look at tonight is called rehearse I want to look at this word rehearse because there's times in the scripture that we look at and God talks about rehearsing and one of the the scripture we're going to read from is Exodus chapter 17 but I want to look at this word where Moses writes a book for Joshua and he says to rehearse it in the ears of Joshua and that's what I want to talk about not because you know the thing is you know God has been so good to us and you know what if we don't praise God he said the rocks would cry out and let me tell you what I don't know about the rest of you but I got a lot to thank him for and you know I mean you go back to your life and you look at things that God's done for you and where he's brought you to and where he's brought you from I tell you what if you can't shout you're dead and I makes you up tonight I may cry don't know what I'm gonna do but you know when you sing God work you know you can't thank him enough hallelujah oh I feel good to know so appreciate this opportunity to speak and but they wanted me to speak last Wednesday I had to go I had a whole surgery and I had a sinus infection so it would have been very good last week so it all worked out I didn't want to I didn't want to tell him no but i had to sew but the lord worked it out so I'm clear and I'm okay so thank the Lord for that and the Lord is the Lord is good to us and I know there's many there's many needs tonight but you know I want I want to look at this and I want to look at faith brother Donnie says brother you like to preach on faith well you know that's that's that's the it's the fight it's the resting place it's the firm foundation of the Word of God it's to have faith you gotta have faith and I know there's many many needs and you know tonight when we looked before we read the scripture I want to pray and I want each one of us no I don't want this just to be another prayer but I want us to be real sincere about what we're praying about I mean really think about what we're praying and I have a friend of mine that his son is in Children's Healthcare of Atlanta tonight and he's got bronchitis and same for Bryson so we're gonna pray for him because his wife Hillary sent out a message earlier send y'all for everybody to pray so you know everybody was going to church tonight so I was like well we're definitely gonna be praying because we gathered in a house of God tonight so we're going we're gonna talk to him cosa you know the one thing where he said where two or three are gathered in in my name I'm in the midst and a guy that I work with I don't know if y'all seen the the news the young lady that's been missing from Atlanta Clark Atlanta University name I let Alexis Crawford her brother works with me and she's been missing since I think the 30th of October so y'all just pray for them tonight they've had the families really taking this hard as anybody would and you know we believe that they can find her alive and everything but you know I pray when I see people have when there's missing people you know always praise like Lord if if they don't find him alive at least let them find them I've had I've had friends where they lose a loved one and they don't recover the body it's it brings closure to the family even when you lose somebody at least you have you have them with you and it helps with the grieving process so we just want but you know it's not gotten to that point yet but you know we still want to believe God he's miracle working God and he can take care of all things we just wanted to pray to him and let him come on the scene because he always he always does so let's just hold bow our heads tonight if you have a need you know on your heart tonight uplifted hands wearing needy people but we serve a great God dear Heavenly Father Lord God we love you tonight because you first loved us Lord no man can come to you Lord it takes you to draw us to yourself and we're just so thankful tonight Lord Lord that you've made this way that you called us into this glorious life this glorious gospel Lord and father tonight we just pray that you come and help us tonight help me get out of the way or do you come and speak the words tonight Lord I can't speak them lord I can study I can pray I can do many things

tonight Lord what you said pray without ceasing Lord we committed ourselves to you Lord we commit all of these needs to you Lord for a little Bryson there in the hospital tonight Lord we pray the things all the Lord goes touches his little body or just a little infant boy Lord trying to breathe that the enemy has attacked his little body but there's a blood of Calvary that's still flowing tonight Lord and we can claim healing Lord there's no one there to intercede for him Lord but the bride of Jesus Christ can and when we just believe that she'll just do a miracle tonight and Lord for this one that's been missing Lord Alexis Lord we don't know where she's at law but we commit it to you and Lord you comfort the family tonight Lord Jesus we believe that you'll come on the scene and

just pray that you be with them stripped and they'll touch them bless the bless the workers Lord the ministry as it goes forth Lord that it will accomplish what it's supposed to do and Lord to bring in the lost ones Lord and just minister in a special way to each one Lord is I was just thinking of a brother Ernie I believe he's supposed to be going to Cambodia from what I was I was reading or we just pray that for the different ones that are traveling Lord wherever they're going whatever the ministry is the meeting sword pray that there'll be a blessing to the people or Jesus anoint each one Lord we commit it all to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Exodus chapter 17 beginning at verse 8 I'm starting to leak already y'all pray for me says then came Amalek and fought with chip with Israel at refitted him and Moses said unto Joshua choose I'll choose us out men and go out and fight with emilich tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Emily and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he led his down his hand Amalek prevailed but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he set their own and Adam in her state up his hands the one on one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until they going down to the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nissi for he said because the lord has sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation and then Malachi 3 verse 16 and it says then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that fault upon his name amen god bless you tonight you may be seated like I said I don't know how this is gonna go but we're going somewhere so y'all just pray for me tonight but I was thinking of the in the in the in our Constitution of the United States our founding fathers wrote a wrote a a passage in there that says that we hold these truths to be self-evident that we have been endowed by our Creator certain unalienable rights and that which is life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that was given to us and you know I was I was thinking on those lines and you know it was so amazing that that the founding fathers wrote that that we have been given these rights by God by our Creator we were given these and you know even though the government has tried to take them away and they tried to do many things but yet these things have been given to us and they even said it was it self-evident that we realized that we've been given these certain rights by God that we have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and you know it's it was the same way today even though and in the skirt in the Constitution tells you that's what governments came for to watch over these things and you know help protect our rights but you today we have these rights we have we have rights and an alienable inalienable means that they cannot be taken away it means that they have been given to the possessor and there's no way that they can be taken away from the possessor and you know it's the way it's the same thing within the word of God because even when we look it's in the scripture you know what we have these rights that we talk about in the country that we have like rights but you know we have rights not as as citizens of the United States or anything we have rights because we are children of God and we have these rights and you know it's we have been given these by God we have the right to do these things we have a right to come bowed before the throne of grace we have a right to claim what's in the scripture we have been given these rights and I thought it was great the way they said it's in alienable why because you cannot nobody can take these rights away from you if you're a child of God you've been given these rights they belong to you and there's no way that they can be taken away from you God's not an Indian giver they give you these rights and then you can stand on these rights and it says we have been given life well you know we do have life why because we have eternal life he said I come that you might have life and that you might have life more abundantly and not only because he said wherever the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty so we have we're living in the time of Liberty when everybody's trying to live in and darkness and bondage but yeah we have Liberty we are living in a time of light we are living in this great freedom that we have because God has given it to us but as children of God because the Bible tells us said we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ that we might suffer with him but we possess the same things that he possesses so if he was free that we're free if he was not he was not bound by anything that we're not bound by anything but thing is as if you don't claim your rights then you can be bound but if you claim your rights then you don't have to be bound and so we can be free and we can pursue happiness or we can pursue the life of God we can we can take the leadership of God and go as far as we want to because you know he said he said that he was or predestinated by our desire because it's not what he wants because it's what we want God's not gonna override your free moral agency he's going to give you that opportunity but you know what if you want to go to a body change then you have the opportunity to go to a body change but you know if you don't want to you don't have to go to why because the scripture Galatians tells us that a child that was born was born a son but you know he had to be tutored he had to be raised up he had to be governed - to come to a place that he could come to me dirty but he was always a son when he was born and you and I are the same way we're born as children but we can be raised up in the image of God we can come to full maturity and God but you know it's our desire we're that we want to make that or not so we have we have that opportunity it belongs to us we have been given those rights and you know here when when Moses was speaking to you know it was so interesting when when Moses is when God tells Moses to write this and write this in a book put this in a memorial to mother and he said he said and rehearse this rehearse this in the ears of Joshua you know right before this time right before the Amalek attacks Israel they are out there in the wilderness if you go back and read the first part of the chapter they're in the wilderness and they're complaining that they have no water they're sitting there drying and they want to go back to Egypt and they're wanting to stone Moses because you've brought us out here in this wilderness to die and wish we could just go back and live in bondage the way we did before when not realizing that God was on the scene God was there to meet and do a miracle in their midst but they didn't see that they didn't see even though God had already done miracles in their midst here he come another time to do another miracle in their midst and they did not realize it and they did not believe it that he had already done miracles in their midst and here he come and then Moses talks to God prays to God and he said take the rod and smite the rock and see if water doesn't come forth and so he smoked the world with the rock in the water came forth but you know what there were a whole bunch of ungrateful Israelites standing in the desert watching water flow out of a rock and it couldn't give God praise and they couldn't thank God for the miracle that happened in their midst and then all of a sudden here comes a maleic attacking them when they'd seen God happened before and then here he said choose men to come and fight and he said write this miracle a book and and go and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua there was something that happened there that that God wanted Joshua never to forget what happened here what happened here because Moses stood on the rocket he told me said I'm gonna go set on the rock and I'm gonna raise my hands and you're going to see you overcome Amalek by the miracle of God with him raising his hands and he wrote that in the book and he said rehearse that rehearse that in their ears why because there was something about that situation that he never wanted Joshua to get away from he wanted Joshua to remember this and brother and sister God wrote these things in the scripture for our examples he said it was to whom the ends of the world are come to this right here what God wills us to deal in this because there's something to us that we need to capture we need to understand we need to realize why because God is the same yesterday today and forever if he done it one time here we'll do it again and so he said write this in a book and he said I would utterly destroy the remembrance of Amalek but he wanted them to write this in a book and never forget what was done here and the word and the word rehearse the word rehearse now when we think of the word rehearse we think the word rehearse means to say again to act out rehearse to say again to repeat to recite aloud in a formal manner to present an account of relate like to rehearse a familiar story to recount in order enumerate something but when you go back and look in the scripture when you look up the word rehearse in the scripture it has a deeper meaning it has a greater meaning when it says go back and rehearse that to in the in the in the Hebrew and from from I don't know how you pronounce it because it looks like sa WM so how are you soum whatever that is but it means to put it means to place means to set a point to make it means to direct to direct to extend something it means to ordain establish found a point constitute make determine fix it means to station means the set in place it means to plant it means to make make for transform into fashion work bring to pass a point to make for a sign to give or to be said so what it means to rehearse something it's not just meaning for it to just to be saying you know because the scripture tells us faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God so it's not just you know when we read that scripture it's not just about hearing the word but it's something that takes that takes place from that there's a transforming power behind them so when he said to rehearse there's a greater meaning in the word rehearse in the scripture when we go back and look at scriptures that talk about the word rehearse when you look that up in the Hebrew a few scriptures so we talked about number one it says that Genesis 2:8 says and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so work the word put meaning to place him somewhere is the word rehearse and and just just give you a few other ones Genesis 415 says and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him so any place the mark upon Cain is the same word as rehearsing there was a placing there in Genesis chapter 22 and verse 6 and it says and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and he laid it upon his upon Isaac his son and took the knife in his in his hand took the fire in his hand and a knife and they both went and they went both of them together and then in verse 9 says and Isaac a blade the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar so that's the same word all those are meant have the same meaning as being rehearsed being placed being established being being formed all those different things in Genesis chapter 24 when Abraham talks to Eliezer he tells Eliezer he said come and put your hand under my thigh he said eldest servant in his houses that ruled over all that he had but I pray thee thy hand under put I pray the hand under my thigh and you know the thigh in the scripture when you look at the scripture because the Bible says that God was riding on the white horse and on his thigh it was written king of kings and Lord of lords showing power that's where s where your power because if you try to lift or move or anything all comes from the pelvic region which comes from the thigh so that's the reason that was showing authority or power that Abraham had that he was swearing that over showing that he was subject to Abraham this reason he put his hand under his thigh so that's reason he swore that oath that way but all those have to do with having placing something and so it's not when we use the word rehearse it's not just rehearsing something not like we're just talking and telling a tall tale but it's something that we rehearse something we want to place this we want it to be established in you we want the Word of God to be stablished because we want something to take place from that so when we read the scripture it's not to be reading the scripture because we're reading about Moses and Elijah or Joshua or the Hebrew children or anything like that because we want to see those things take place but we want to see ourselves in the scripture we want to see ourselves they're who we are as in the scripture why because those were examples to us that we can see and draw from exactly what they went through now this is from the message raising Jairus daughter brother Branham says he said he said now our subject tonight is a great understanding instance in the Bible and this is where he talks about Jairus coming and coming to Jesus about his daughter and then you know the they come and said don't trouble the master your daughter's dead but you know Jesus said that doesn't matter said when you go home you'll find her she's well he didn't worry that she was dead I mean whether whether she was sick or where she was dead he was still the one in control he was still the giver of life so when he spoke it didn't matter the devil had to leave anyway she had to come back to life he says I love to rehearse his words here on earth and when we when he was here in a corporal body as he hath said that he would be with us and manifest himself to us until the end of the age and the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if we can rehearse some of his sentences just before we pray for the sick and declared to the sick that he that do all that he's not dead but alive for we see of his actions and his attitudes in the days gone by then we could expect the same thing in this day now don't you think so if he is the same and he says he said now I want to speak of this I would to God with this lovely feeling of spirit this little group of people here a little group of people tonight if each one of you would get in your mind into your heart that our Savior is not dead but he's alive and present now just as president as he ever was in any age gone by just as present as he was with Noah just as president he was with Abraham just as president he was with the Hebrew children present as he was with the patriarchs and all the apostles and all down all through the age he's the same yesterday today and forever the same he said now let's get that in our minds and remember that he is ever present and there's no creature that could be omnipresent except for God himself no other creature he said the devil is a great force the devil has a great power and the devil is great in his power but he's under the power of God and the devil can only be at one place at a time his imps can be everywhere scattered out his his demons his co-workers but God Himself is alone in his field of omnipresence not an angel but God himself hallelujah then that gives us courage wherever two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst that's universal everywhere so we know that wherever two or three are gathered in his name he said he would be there in the midst and he is in our midst tonight so he is here to meet our needs if we could get that in our mind to realize he's just the same as he was back then he's here to do the exact same thing you know you can't as brother I'm said you can't get worn by a painted fire but you know there's a fire that's here tonight that's just as real as it ever was anywhere else and he's here to meet your needs if you have a need then he's here to meet your needs and you know because if we if we go back in the scripture and we go back in our own lives because that's one of the things I want to talk about tonight if we go back in the scripture and look to see what God done if you will dwell on the things that God has done and not on your problems and not only your obstacles and not your troubles but you meditate on his word day and night and look at what God has said in his word and what this is what the answer is then you know he will come on the scene and the message testimony on the seat you know brother M talks about how the disciples were in the boat together and they began to discuss the things that they had seen with God and because you know and it talks about Peter and the different ones talking about you know there was a time when daddy told us about what went on in the past what what they said and they said we read the scrolls and how they talked about how a messiah was coming and you know we always go back to what daddy said and what mama said but you know today we saw and when he come and he spoke to each one of us individually and how do we have a testimony of exactly what took place and when we you know we were looking for him and then he come visible among us and as they were oh they're in that boat speaking of that thing that he came visible among them and come and spoke to him in the midst of their storm they were sitting there and then he come and spoke to him and said you know don't be afraid it is I why because they were speaking of him and they had their mind on him and you know he came on in the midst no matter what this is what the situation looked like you know he came to their men in their myths and he met there needing done a miracle in front of them so he's the same yesterday today and forever and you know many times we go back and look and we wonder what took place in the past and what took place back there and the different ones but you know the thing is he's the same and we can go back and it really one of the things I want to talk about it I think is very important is to us to share with the young people with our children to what God has done in our lives and why what has happened in our family why because if you can see what God has done you know what God has done in your life then you know he's the same yesterday today and forever you know the scripture Joel 1:3 says tell you your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation so it's important why because he wanted them to expound all of these things never let this drop never never fail but to continue in generation after generation after generation he said that he said what the Palmer warm left the kegger 1:8 and he said they shot all the way down and it continued and you go through joel chapter 1 and can see how bad everything just continues to get worse and get worse and get worse and get worse but you know there's a time and you and Joel chapter 2 but he said I will restore all the years of the cankerworm aid and the locusts and the caterpillar everything has been eaten down he said my great army but he said I'm going to restore that and you know many times we can go back and we can look and see all the things that's happened and yet everything continues to get worse and continue to get worse but let me tell you God is here and he's going to restore he is here to restore because he ascends the word restoration and he's put it in the midst of the people and you know what if you can believe it then everything that you have can be restored it's not just about having bank accounts and having fancy cars and everything like it but let me tell you something you and I have the ability have the spoken word and we can speak life and you know we can have our children we can claim our children we can claim our loved ones we can speak and God will honor our faith and will answer our prayers why because he said he would when we said we talk about what God has done in the past you know we fail to realize what God has done in our midst you know Gideon Gideon was there and chapter six of Judges you know Gideon talks you know and I'm just gonna read part of this and it says and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord and he came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites that the Lord sent a prophet under the children of Israel which said unto them thus saith the Lord of God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorite sand whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel unto the Lord of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in Ofra that pertained under Joe s the ABA's ached and his son Gideon Thresh wheat by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor and Gideon said unto Him o my lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us where be all his miracles which our fathers brought us of told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the LORD hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might that thou shalt save Israel from the hands of the Midianites have not i sent thee and he sent unto him o my lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee thou shalt smite the millions as one man I tell you what know that if I don't light your fire your woods wet because here is here is a man that's living and you know a year after year after year the Midianites came in and stole from them and they were impoverished and they're starving to death and they have nothing and here there they keep going through all of this and they're crying out to God and all of a sudden a prophet comes into the land and the prophet speaks unto Him and he tells them exactly what took place before here he is he brings up the word it says did you not come out of Egypt did you not come out of bondage did you not come out from all of these things and you came into the land and not only did you get victory over your enemy but you received their land then here you are in this midst and now you've allowed another enemy come in and take everything from you then he said an angel of the Lord come before Gideon and stood in his mess and told him that he was a mighty man of Valor and Matt Gideon couldn't believe it look oh look at look what condition I'm in oh we're starving to death my family's poor in Manasseh and I'm the least in my father's house he said how can i how can these things meet but he told him he said you know what he said I'm giving you the word that you can overcome that you're gonna be the one that's gonna do these things and he said it's gonna be just as if there was one man it's so amazing that here we are and we received the word we've we've had a profit in our age we've received and in the angel of the Lord in our day and he's come and he spoke to us and he's given us the word of overcoming everything that you have need of the answers of every question has been given to us all the things that you need for this earthly journey has been given to us you know there was a there was a time you go back and look and you look and see what what leuthar went through and what Wesley and the different ones you know they had mad problems and and things and they didn't have the full word and all there but you know what we've been given a full word in our day we've been one because God has called us to this God has called us to be the ones there's not going to be another group come up behind us we're the ones that's going to carry this thing home to the rapture why because it has been spoken God has given us the word he's given us that Commission to take it home there's not gonna be another another group come behind us we're not looking to another age why because we need to realize this is aging which God is dealing with people say oh I wish I lived in Bible days you're living in the greatest Bible day that you can live in why because he laid everything out for this day this is our day and he come to this one and you know what brother Branham said if I could live in any day he said I want to live in this day I'd want to live in this day well you know what brother Branham came and done his part he can field fulfilled his Commission and now you know what he laid a commission out before each one of us and you know it is our day to do the same we after we have to come and fulfill our Commission you know we can be just like just like Gideon you know why is all these things but following this why do we have all these different problems and why we have all these things why because God wants you to get to a place that you can get to a place that God can come on the scene when your brother Graham said the church always the bride always done better under persecution why you've got to have problems you gotta have stress you gotta have things lay down before you why because if you don't you don't trust God there ain't no there ain't no such thing as an easy war there's no such thing as an easy battle I always talk about Abbott and Costello which everyone was a habit to I guess they're Costello I can't matter which one it is but you know the comedian little short felt God you know he's all otome out he was in the army and you know how turned he was told him he told the other guy said you know he said he said I was in the battle he said I was where the bullets were the heaviest he said oh really he said where was that he said under the ammo truck yeah people want to be people want to be there but you know they don't want to be where it's where the where the battles going on they want to try to find someplace to hide but unity they would you know what they you got to realize you've got to go through troubles and trials and heartaches and problems why because God wants to work a miracle in your life and those are the things that takes place that you have to trust God you know nobody nobody wants to thank God when they're on we're on the front side of the the trials and the tribulations but you know when we go back and you look and you see what God has done for you you know we can we can worship God on the other side but we can't see that God's working on this side when he's working on the front side of these when God is working on this side and we can see the things that's taken place what God is doing we don't we don't see that God is working in our midst and you know there's many things that I want to look at tonight but I don't want to be here too long but you know I want I want to get to this point because I wanted to look at one thing because you know if we can see what God has done in our lives and what God has done for us then you know we need to rehearse that we need to bring that up and you know the thing is is you you have children sometimes and they and they they read the stories of the Bible you have young people they read the stories of the Bible and they wonder where that God is is that God real and you know many times we don't we don't express in our own family what God has done that God you know because we think well you know I'm the only one and we fail to realize what God has done in the past in your own personal families you know many times we don't we don't look back and we think well you know why does God done in my life what God has done in my family and you know sometimes when you sit down and God shows you things that's taking place you know and then you realize you know God has been all along the way how did you get here you know if you know because you had to come to look a certain way there had to be certain people meat for you to come to be where you are today and you know if it hadn't been for for the grace of God and the mercy of God the leadership of the Holy Ghost to do the things that he done you wouldn't be here right I mean you know there's people come from other countries that that come to come here and all of a sudden they meet and and you know all of a sudden and then you're here how did how did that take place you know people who don't realize that you know I think about my grandfather my dad's dead you know he served in he served under General Patton in World War two he was a combat engineer Richard can tell you some of the stories he landed on a beach and Europe I think it was 53 or 50 four men hit the beach and he was there was only one or two of them that survived of that whole thing multiple times they were building they built a bridge back three or four times and every time they had it built the Germans would bomb and they had to go in there rebuild the bridge and he had a steel plate fall on him and land it on him and he had to lay under that and pretend he was dead after everybody else was dead and laid there until the Allied scum and got the metal off of him so he could get up he told us about being in a battle where the bullets were flying at them and he said the angel of the Lord stood before us and he said he said because the bullets were coming in our direction and he said the bullets were going to the left and to the right he said you could hear the ricocheted off the bullets going out of our direction he said it he said it should have been us and say we think you know how did how did I get here why because it was the grace of God that I'm here why because he had to survive that for me to get here and we and sometimes we don't we don't think and stop and think you know what miracles that has happened in our lives that God has to come and you know and then we start to look and you see how God has moved in your life and we sometimes we fail to give God praise and glory for the things that he's done in our lives well because we can see help my dad in the situation he's in you know when my mom when when Levi was little I don't know how many years ago it was but you know I mean they told they told my my dad to go ahead and make her funeral arrangements you know because when she got that infection in her neck and got so low that she had organ failure and everything else and you know and they wanted they wanted to write her off and you know dad that wouldn't do that and you know and and the doctor told and said I don't even know how she's still alive and dad told him said it's because of the prayers of the saints that she's still alive and the doctor said you got to keep doing that because that's the only thing keeping her alive well you know what's the same it's the same God that was there that they're protected my grandfather there was Stover my mom that's in the hospital with my dad tonight now we can sit there and we can say you know and when we don't we don't understand how well he's going to get you know what God's already come on the scene when they tell you that if they don't do surgery he's gonna die and they're not even sure if you do surgery that he's gonna survive and all of a sudden that man's laying in a hospital bed and he can talk to you and he knows who people are and he knows things that he you know and he still got a long way to go but you know he's a miracle laying in that bed when a man wants to live when a man wakes up every single day and only thing you can talk about is going home and eating food you know the man's ready to go but you know we fail to give God praise and glory for the things that have happened in our lives because many times we don't take and sit down and take a count of what God's done for us and actually sit down and look and count our blessings you know there was a there was a song years ago and it said if you take a piece of paper and and you draw a line down the middle of it and you know you need to write all your problems on one side and all your all your blessings on the other and it says you'll always find that your blessings outnumber your troubles every time you know many times we have we don't ever take an account of doing that and see what God has done for us and actually putting down in paper what God has done for us I was thinking about brother Ryan writing those little books of testimonies of what people have done and you know one little testimony what people wouldn't God has done in people's lives and you know many times we have failed to sit down and actually take a full account of what God has done for us every single time in our day and our daily lives to see what God has done you know I was thinking about when Adam was Adam before Adam was born you know Sarah had a lot of bleeding and you know they really thought that she might have miscarried and you know we didn't know if he was gonna make it or not but you know what we committed him to the hands of God we told brother Dale and you know we prayed and we believed and you know what God brought Adam here he's here tonight but you don't we didn't have we did not know what was going to take place but you know what it's not not living in fear it's knowing who's got everything in control who who's holding tomorrow who's holding you who's holding everything and you know you trust God that he can come on the scene and meet your needs why because you know you can you can worry and you can fret but you know what there's nothing good and worried there's nothing good and fretting there's nothing worried and worrying about anything why because you've got to put in the hands of God and watch him come on the scene you know I think I told I told him I said we went through trying to get a mortgage on this new house and I told him I said you know when we get through this thing I may just get up in the church and run around for a while I wanted a shout so bad it was why because you know you deal with one mortgage company and they don't they don't know split peas from coffee grounds and they're trying to loan you money and it's like how in the world y'all in business and finally we just we just dropped in we don't listen we got to go find someone else somebody else in this world's got to be better than them well you know what anyone much better I told Sarah I was like hey you know what if we don't get the mortgage we're just gonna go rent a place because you know what God don't want us to have this house but you know what there was a ho you know we prayed about I prayed right as like Lord if this is your will weed then you work it out right but you know we sit there and two days with our second mortgage company and I mean they wanted everything they wanted so much stuff from us that I've never heard some all the stuff that they wanted Sarah finally sent her shoe size with him when the Nate won one of the emails they listed everything else that she won't and she put what size shoe she wore the guy that worked for the mortgage company he wrote back ha ha ha there's like well everything's online they know everything about you they know what you know you go online and look look up something you search the next thing you know then you get emails home stuff that you looked at nobody else knows about but they know it they know more about you than you you let them and when they run a background check on you when they run your name and everything for your for your mortgage and it says this person is known by all these other names in something I didn't know people knew me by that but you know what somewhere in some computer that's what you're listed but you you look at all the things that you that you have to go through and I was amazing then in two days before two days before we closed they said everything's good you're good to go everything's great okay praise the Lord we finally went through this way you're wiping switch great sigh of relief then they come back and said oh no you owe us some more money it's like you know what the wells run dry I don't know where you plan on getting any more money and it's like well guess what we're gonna have to postpone as like listen we've already been down this road because originally the way it was set up we were going to close on one house and buy the other one so we were going to sell our house in the morning and buy the other house in the afternoon and guess what we wouldn't have to do nothing move from one house - together well they didn't work out that way next thing you know we're having to find a place to rent for three weeks trying to get this resolved then we had to drop the mortgage company and get another mortgage company and they were like well we're gonna try and get you by the 10th of October where we're not sure work and he's like well you know what we've done a lot of prayin and Sarah would come home and she's like well I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't know what you gotta calm down you got to calm down she's like well I'm so worried I'm just you gotta calm down and you know because as soon as she would come in the house and she would be so frustrated with stuff that you know it just feets through the whole house then everybody's frustrated and everybody's like I know y'all don't have to deal with that but we do but you know it's like just calm down you gotta trust God but you know it's hard to trust God when you when you see the things and it's like is there gonna is there any light at the end of the tunnel is there no way out of this mess are you ever going to get anywhere and then after you go through I'll listen then two days before you close everything's good and they call you back so oh we need more money it's not gonna work out but what do you mean and it's like we didn't then they were saying wait we're gonna have to wait till Friday it's like no we're closing on Thursday it's Thursday or no deal we got to close on thirsty and they told us well that don't look like it's gonna work out that way I was like well you know what we're just gonna put this in the hands of the Lord and let the Lord deal with it they told us we needed more money so we have a very generous brother here at the church who decided to make a little loan to us till we get everything straightened out pop it on over here but you know and then it's like well you can't do that because he's not related to you money's money they didn't want that they liked that idea so here we go we're go back to square one what are we going to do but we haven't we had an awesome realtor and she's like I'm going on vacation this lady that's selling you're selling the house to you is in the process of buying one and she's got everything lined up and the only problem with all of this working out is your mortgage company so she told us that this ain't going to work she calls a mortgage company and tells them listen y'all cut my commission on the selling of this house by enough money to cover the extra money that they need to close on this house and she said I'll take less money in the mortgage on my commission so we can get this thing worked out because everybody else is waiting on y'all to get your act together well next thing you know the mortgage company called us back and told us the man that was doing the mortgage he called me back he said I'm almost in tears he said I thought that was so your Realtor account and she wanted to take cut her Commission and get all this thing worked out and then she said he said well we're going in there and they're reworking the numbers so it's like oh well good we'll see what happens see if this thing will work out they tell you how God moves not only did our realtor get her full Commission the amount of money that we had to take to closing was three thousand dollars less than what they originally told us what our mortgage closing cost would be that comes from them telling us you can't close on Thursday because you don't have enough money to them giving her her full Commission and we were three thousand dollars less than what we had though and I tell you what if you don't if you don't yeah if you go through all that and you and you're just ready to wring your hands and you just and I told myself we're just done with this I said we're ready to walk away from this house I just not gonna deal with it I'm just I just can't and all of a sudden next thing you know that worked out I was like you know what I go to church I think I'm gonna dance the challenge in the in the aisles I say you know you go through that and fight two mortgage companies and go through all that and eggs saying you know you you feel like you know you all of a sudden God comes on the scene and works things out and so I praise the Lord I want to get up and dance awhile because you know God it was it's a miracle what God done for me and you know you you can't you can't thank God enough and it's you know things like that that you know we don't give God the glory we don't give him enough honor we don't give him enough praise of the things that he's done you know I want to give him all the praise the honor and glory all the things that he's done for me why because he has done so much and I have been so blessed that I if you know words cannot be expressed we don't have the human language you've never expressed what God means to us but you know if we can sit down and we think about what God has done for us all the blessings that we have received in this life all the things that we that we have been through in this world you know you think about I think about where that man was brother Ram told that man about how hard it wasn't difficult for him to come come to the meeting or come to come to where he was that and you know that I asked him said well what was the problem he said I got in the car and I drove there but brother branham could see in that other dimension what took place you know many times we don't we don't say we just we just think well you know we wonder why things happen the way they do and you know many times we don't realize that God's been protecting us and the things that God has done to watch over us and many times we find out later that God has protected us and you know because you know there's times at work you're working on something and you don't see the danger you know it's just like brother been talking about Branum tabernacle he said he said where they had the fire the furnace in the end the church originally he said the rafters and everything were burnt back for several feet and he said how in the world he didn't fall under all that snow and everything he said it should have collapsed and you know you're at work sometimes you're working on something and you don't see the danger and all of a sudden you just walk around like nothing's going on and all of a sudden realize you know that thing should have fell on me sometimes it's not braced right sometimes sometimes you forget to bolt something up sometimes you put weight on on a frame or something that's not bolted right I've had I've had acetylene torches malfunction they had a man in Charlotte many years ago that had a malfunctioning acetylene torch and it backed up into the from the torch head it backed up into the the regulators and it calls one of the say the regulator's to explode and they said the knob on the front of the regulator when it blew off had the velocity of a 30 off six and killed him and you think and you think about the little things like that and you know the data is that you know we think that they're little but you know what there's a there's a real danger there you know and there's things that happening and and all of a sudden you realize later you know what God was watching over us that these little things have happened all the things that God has done in our lives where God is watching over sometimes we know that God has protected us in Oh times we don't realize the danger that we've been in we don't know until when these days that we're gonna see the other side and see all the things that our guardian angels had to do for us that how many times God has protected us and watched over us and all the things that God has done for us how blessed we are you know not just not just in our and our daily walk but in our Christian walk how God has blessed us and and brought us to the place that we are today because God has given us eternal life he spoke to us and come and went found us and brought us and drawn him to us to himself and then he gave us his own life you know filled us with the Holy Ghost and then blessed us at all spiritual blessings brother and said we are now sitting in heavenly places because we are a child of God because God has given us because he said because we are heir of God and joint-heirs with Christ and now sitting in heavenly places how blessed we are to see who we are and what God has done for us and you know and not just not just to talk about what God has done for us but to really lay a hold on what God has done for you and know what God is doing for you and what God wants to do for you God wants to bless you and you know whatever you have need of tonight what it is financial spiritual whatever it is God is here to meet your need you know we are so we're such a blessed people and sometimes we become relaxed to what God wants us to do we don't have the fervency as brother branham said the angel the Lord told him said and you need to be more sincere and you're looking at looking at the life that brother Branham lived you know he didn't say well you know I'm doing this and I'm doing that no look at all the stuff he said lower Lord let me be more sincere Lord let me be more sincere let us let us just stand tonight and have the musicians come but I want us to look at and see what God has done for us to rehearse those things that God has done for us every morning his mercies are new all the things that he's done for us he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings I'm gonna read one more thing then we're gonna we're gonna singing let them we worship the Lord and thank the Lord for what he's done for us and realize all the blessings that we have you know we didn't have to our we didn't have to earn any one thing that God done for us it's only by His mercy and grace that he's blessed us with these things me man well my tablets not working he's Tong hung up we're gonna praise the Lord anyhow I just want to read this this passage of Scripture forward for we sing it says blessed the Lord Psalms 103 says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto Moses his axon to the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous and mercy he will not always chide neither will his anger keep his anger forever he has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like I say father pitieth his children so the Lord Pelias them that fear him for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust for as man his days are grass as a flower of the field so he flourished it for the wind passes over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his commandment and to those that remember his Commandments to do them the LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom rule of over all blessed blessed the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do His commandments harkening unto the voice of his word bless you the Lord all ye his hosts you ministers of his they do his pleasure bless the Lord all his works in all places of his Dominion bless the Lord O my soul hey man I just wanted to read that amen
