[18:34] love with Jesus just like getting
[18:37] married spoken from a true child amen
[18:40] all right let's bow our heads Lord thank
[18:42] you for this day Lord and I pray that
[18:43] you'd be with us give us this day our
[18:45] daily bread father we're just a family
[18:48] here group Lord and I pray that you just
[18:49] be with us Lord all the functions and
[18:52] things we do we want to do it Lord for
[18:54] your honor and glory and we also want
[18:56] the people to feel at home we want all
[18:58] all of us to feel like one big family
[19:00] Lord I pray that you just be with us now
[19:02] and answer these questions Lord if there
[19:04] be any other questions Lord we pray that
[19:06] you just answer them while these are
[19:08] being answered father thank you for the
[19:10] ones that have asked the questions Lord
[19:12] and many times we look over the the
[19:15] youth but father there was one day when
[19:17] you were here in human flesh you sat
[19:19] down one
[19:20] day as it was you just sat down on a
[19:23] partk bench and the kid started coming
[19:25] around you playing and all the disciples
[19:28] they didn't like that but you rebuked
[19:31] them and said leave them
[19:33] alone cuz such is the Kingdom of Heaven
[19:37] you have to be like a little child to
[19:39] enter into the kingdom father we know we
[19:41] start as a child Lord but grow into
[19:44] adult so father we pray that you'd be
[19:45] with us now as we answer these questions
[19:47] Lord May they'd be done for your honor
[19:48] and glory be with the ones that are sick
[19:50] ones that are not with us Lord be with
[19:52] the ones on the Foreign Fields we
[19:53] haven't prayed for the missionaries Lord
[19:55] much we pray that you'd be with them
[19:56] Lord there's still some out there that's
[19:57] laboring in father in the different
[19:59] countries we pray that you'd be with
[20:01] them Lord take care of each one Lord in
[20:03] the fur of this service in Jesus name we
[20:05] pray amen we don't have a scripture to
[20:07] read so you can be
[20:12] seated I think we maybe couldn't read
[20:14] the scripture that brother Luis is
[20:16] reading the other night think on these
[20:17] things and I think I have a quote that
[20:19] he quoted the other night so we want to
[20:21] start with number one how to approach
[20:24] youth camps now there has been many
[20:29] um
[20:31] opinions um
[20:34] attitudes toward youth camps all right
[20:38] over the years uh we've been
[20:40] involved sister June and I um the kids
[20:44] growing up here brother Boyd and Sister
[20:46] Janet different ones we go to these
[20:49] youth camps and started in about 1999 to
[20:52] 2000 we went all the way to what 2006 or
[20:56] 8 or something with in Alabama and then
[20:59] we supported other youth camps
[21:02] now there are some that we can't support
[21:04] all of them but most of them we do try
[21:07] to support because the ones we know of
[21:10] the preachers that preach at these youth
[21:12] camps are not going to preach Doctrine
[21:15] so much to where it's going to confuse
[21:17] the people cuz it shouldn't do that you
[21:20] should preach salvation you should
[21:22] preach how to court how to how to get
[21:25] married how to how different things like
[21:27] that and that's usually what well 99.9%
[21:30] of the time that's what's being preached
[21:32] so the re the way uh the brother asked
[21:34] he said how should I approach going to a
[21:37] youth camp well going to a youth camp
[21:39] number one is you want to support your
[21:42] kid to go all right
[21:46] um there's a fine line that that I see
[21:50] that either you can tell ask them listen
[21:53] if you ask a kid to do
[21:55] something and you're a parent most of
[21:57] the time while they they going to say
[22:01] no right Bella shake your head yeah but
[22:04] it's a
[22:05] no right okay so and I don't agree with
[22:10] making them go
[22:13] but when I was growing up we didn't have
[22:16] a choice to go to church we went we went
[22:20] until we got married we went until we
[22:23] got married right Jim right Dad and Mom
[22:25] we went there wasn't no uh playing
[22:28] around so there is a fine line there you
[22:32] can make them go and I've seen them be
[22:34] so
[22:35] miserable but you know where that starts
[22:37] from the
[22:39] home corre should I read the quote where
[22:43] brother Brown said it wasn't juvenile
[22:45] delinquency it was parental
[22:47] delinquency what you say at your home
[22:50] about the pastor or what you say about
[22:52] the church or even what you say about
[22:54] youth camps it goes right over into the
[22:57] kids correct if I'm wrong somebody stand
[23:00] up and correct me it's that way it's
[23:02] been that way
[23:04] forever that it's what the parents
[23:07] say just like anything else the parents
[23:11] are only the kids are only going to say
[23:13] what the parents
[23:16] say just way it is so if you down youth
[23:20] camps and you make them so horrible it's
[23:23] nothing more and I know there was one
[23:25] old Minister he told me one time he said
[23:27] it's just a place for kids to go and get
[23:30] married and find a mate and that's it
[23:33] well that's not all it but you know what
[23:35] I'd rather them go and find one there
[23:37] than to go and find one at The Honky
[23:40] Tonk or at school or at a bar or
[23:43] wherever you want to talk about I'd
[23:45] rather him approach a youth that's at
[23:47] least maybe got a little bit of
[23:49] structure at home being a message
[23:52] Believer from a believing home now we
[23:55] have seen and Jun and I being counselors
[23:57] and Bo and Janet and different ones of
[23:59] y'all but we were for a stretch there
[24:01] about 8 years that we were counselors
[24:03] you've seen them that it wasn't going to
[24:04] do a bit of
[24:05] good to help them you know I mean you
[24:09] try to get them to do right and Junes
[24:12] had to get lipstick off of the ceilings
[24:14] and and all thing you know you're not
[24:16] supposed to lipstick at a message
[24:18] believer's Youth Camp how' that happen
[24:21] but it did you know where they got it
[24:22] from
[24:23] home if you most of the time look at
[24:26] their mom no I'm not going there never
[24:27] mind
[24:31] so anyway you look at the tight dress of
[24:33] the mama and you look over at the
[24:36] kid telling it's parental delinquency
[24:39] I'm telling you blame the parents don't
[24:41] blame the kids the kids like I told you
[24:43] the one of the most I wish I could I'm
[24:45] going try to find that book the book was
[24:48] called children are like wet cement cuz
[24:51] wet cement you can make any kind of
[24:53] impression you want to but if you leave
[24:55] it there when it hardens how many of you
[24:58] have built on to your house or built a a
[25:00] porch on your house I know brother
[25:02] already did at our house 20 something
[25:04] years ago well here we go we start
[25:06] pressing our hands into this into the
[25:08] cement you know and and got their Deana
[25:11] wasn't even born the kids were little
[25:13] you know they were pressing their hands
[25:14] in 2001 what it's still there so the
[25:19] impression that we made 20 something
[25:21] years ago is still there today same way
[25:23] with us about anything Church what to do
[25:28] at functions well I'm going just let my
[25:30] kid do what they want to do well that's
[25:33] probably why some of them are not here
[25:35] now you know what I hurt your feelings
[25:37] I'm sorry I've been hurting people's
[25:38] feelings I'm I'm sorry that I do that
[25:41] but I want to say one more time if I'm
[25:43] lying to you tell me I'm lying but if
[25:45] I'm telling you the truth you got to be
[25:46] a child of God you got to take
[25:48] it
[25:54] sorry I mean if I'm we out on a limb and
[25:56] tell you you got to do something that
[25:58] ain't in the Bible then yeah you you you
[26:00] you just tell me right now but if I can
[26:02] put in the word of God and the prophet's
[26:04] message and what brother Dale's preached
[26:05] to us for 50 years whose fault is
[26:09] that and I fell short too I have one
[26:12] that does not come to church so I'm not
[26:13] I'm pointing at me too we're all on the
[26:16] same level like I said before
[26:18] selfishness we don't need to be selfish
[26:21] right the most unselfish thing is to
[26:24] want everybody to be
[26:25] saved everybody
[26:30] regardless amen now I don't we don't
[26:33] need to be preaching I need to answer
[26:34] these questions Bob you got to stop
[26:37] me but
[26:39] listen what I want to see if an approach
[26:41] to youth camps number one I want you to
[26:44] do is expect something from
[26:48] God you know you're going to see other
[26:50] people you know you're going to see
[26:53] people and usually you're going to be
[26:54] put with people of your age group is
[26:56] that right right I mean that's what
[26:58] we've been you know even Alabama you put
[27:00] the group over here and you put a group
[27:02] over here you don't want to put
[27:03] 18-year-old kids with six-year-old boys
[27:05] they ain't got they can't they can't
[27:09] interact but you put everybody together
[27:11] so what the reason we come to church is
[27:13] what is that we can fellowship and we
[27:16] can learn from each other well that's
[27:17] the way a youth camp should be when you
[27:19] go to youth camp you should go and say
[27:20] look I'm going to get something for god
[27:22] listen if you find a friend that you can
[27:24] converse with online orever how you want
[27:26] to do that that's a
[27:28] bonus if you find a girlfriend and
[27:31] you're a boy then that's an extra bonus
[27:33] we're going to talk about that a little
[27:34] bit later on do and don't of courting
[27:36] and dating and all that stuff but I
[27:40] believe you should go expecting
[27:42] something from God because once you get
[27:45] something from God all that other stuff
[27:47] seek you first the kingdom of heaven all
[27:51] right now I know too
[27:54] that kids are are just in emotional
[27:59] bundle is that all
[28:01] right
[28:03] feelings you know de today she said I
[28:06] hate these
[28:09] pimples she I hate these pimples I said
[28:12] I have them too sometimes I'm 63 years
[28:15] old but they don't bother
[28:18] me
[28:20] amen but see it bothers them though you
[28:22] say well it doesn't bother me cuz I'm 63
[28:24] it doesn't bother me it does bother her
[28:27] because of the what she presents so what
[28:31] you present and so be careful and like
[28:34] if you if you'll just see every one of
[28:36] these questions every one of them you
[28:38] can answer them the same
[28:40] way courtship
[28:43] dating right is it wrong to pray for
[28:45] teams win you know teams and brother R
[28:48] said uh talk about Adam and
[28:51] Eve all this is going to be pulled in
[28:54] together because look what is a woman
[28:56] she's a bundle of nerves
[28:58] yeah right nervous she leans to her
[29:01] emotion every time the prophet said
[29:04] right that's why Paul says you don't
[29:07] want a woman to be preaching because
[29:08] she's going to preach her
[29:10] emotion all right she's going to she's
[29:12] going to be the Mama she's going to be
[29:15] the mama that that's oh well it's okay
[29:17] now there's a balance we know that but a
[29:20] woman shouldn't be preaching in because
[29:21] the first preacher was Eve and what did
[29:24] she do she messed it all up because of
[29:26] what because she was working toward her
[29:28] emotion we'll get into that in just a
[29:30] few minutes cuz when Adam and Eve were
[29:32] separated the emotional the sweet the
[29:37] gentle the the mother part that was in
[29:41] Adam now is in a woman called Eve and
[29:43] Satan could look at her and watch her
[29:45] through her life and say I can get to
[29:47] that I can't get to that cuz he's the
[29:49] manly one he's the one that he's the one
[29:51] that you know I got to build a house I
[29:53] got to kill the not at that time but you
[29:54] know the mentality is the man's got to
[29:56] build a house keep the keep the place
[29:58] clean kill the deer drag it home you
[30:01] know clean it and let the wife cook
[30:04] it amen you ought to try that
[30:09] sometime but that's the way it is when
[30:12] when God divided he wanted to make
[30:15] because guess what you and I are a Tope
[30:17] of
[30:17] that we are Eve right we're the second
[30:21] Eve so we have the emotion and we have
[30:24] all we like the emotional part but we're
[30:26] also more acceptable to lies than Christ
[30:29] was amen so we'll get to that in just a
[30:31] few minutes well maybe in a little while
[30:33] so how to approach Youth Camp let me
[30:35] read something a brother brother Paul La
[30:37] Fontaine U Brother Joseph has them and
[30:40] they're on our website somebody asked
[30:42] him about the same thing so I just want
[30:44] to pull a few things out of here three
[30:46] main points that he makes and one
[30:49] Ministry to young people is important
[30:51] because of the age that we live in much
[30:54] could be said of the carefully designed
[30:56] enticement from Satan directed toward
[30:58] youth in the last 50 years and that's
[30:59] exactly right if Satan can get the
[31:02] youth he's got the Next Generation
[31:05] that's what he's doing that's why
[31:06] brother Brown said every generation is
[31:08] getting weaker and weaker worse and
[31:09] worse all right so and and you know what
[31:12] that's not God's doing that's the
[31:14] devil's doing cuz he knows there'll be
[31:16] another
[31:19] Generation all right if we have another
[31:21] generation we got to have some sisters
[31:23] that keep their virginity so they can
[31:25] marry and have preachers and they we're
[31:27] going to have deacons and we got to have
[31:29] song leaders and we got to have players
[31:31] of instruments that's the Next
[31:34] Generation Well they just not not
[31:36] developed like this they've got to be
[31:37] developed over time everybody with
[31:41] me young people are so blinded by the
[31:44] spirit being things behind things of
[31:47] this age without the Holy Ghost and down
[31:49] toe wisdom from God they'll never be
[31:52] able to see through this mess and he's
[31:53] exactly correct you'll never be able to
[31:56] see through this unless you've got good
[31:58] quality preachers good quality Ley good
[32:01] quality the Bible says the younger the
[32:03] older should teach the younger all right
[32:07] and let me tell you something a good key
[32:08] to your success kids is to listen to
[32:11] older people listen you may not listen
[32:13] to your mom and dad cuz they're
[32:16] idiots mine was till I got about 30 then
[32:20] they just smarted up just they just
[32:22] everything they said was right and
[32:24] everything backwards was right amen come
[32:28] on admit
[32:29] it no you're the
[32:31] idiot Until you realize that they were
[32:34] that way all smart all the time Luke you
[32:37] can tell your you can tell your mama
[32:39] that you tell your mama that too Lucas
[32:40] you can tell your mama that too I'll
[32:41] tell her tomorrow actually when I see
[32:44] Justina I'll tell her tomorrow Luke said
[32:46] you crazy ding
[32:49] dong but without the Holy Ghost and down
[32:52] to earth wisdom from God they'll never
[32:53] be able to see through this mess the
[32:55] young people have always always needed
[32:58] Direction and that's right never think
[33:01] your kid is going to do right all the
[33:04] time that's where Eve fell by thinking
[33:08] she was doing the right thing all the
[33:10] time everybody with me all
[33:13] right so I think that's really good but
[33:16] they will need it more in the end time
[33:18] than ever
[33:20] before listen can I be just let me just
[33:24] be down to earth when I was growing up
[33:27] when I was
[33:28] 12 years old you going to think this is
[33:31] funny and and I'm sorry but I'm going to
[33:33] try to make a point that some of you get
[33:36] some of you will get some of you won't
[33:39] get because it's just kids 12 years old
[33:43] playing on the playground at 12 years
[33:46] old well maybe close to 10 or 11 in
[33:49] Gillsville there are the places still
[33:51] there I got my beehives there but the
[33:53] the old gy is
[33:55] there well we just happen to be crawling
[33:57] under the
[34:00] gym keep put your fingers in your
[34:03] ears and we
[34:06] found a
[34:10] magazine that had
[34:12] some things in it that you shouldn't be
[34:16] looking at lots of them about that thick
[34:20] somebody had poked it up in the probably
[34:22] some back in Daddy's days back that way
[34:24] that poked
[34:25] the no that wasn't true these were black
[34:27] these were not black and white they were
[34:30] color but anyway I'm going to make a
[34:32] point here I was a kid guess what I
[34:34] didn't go I leave that alone I'm
[34:39] like come on somebody and I and then at
[34:43] recess from then
[34:52] on come here Keith let me show you what
[34:55] I found
[34:59] then the next
[35:03] day cuz we were
[35:06] kids and I surely wasn't going to go
[35:09] home and tell Mom and Daddy what I found
[35:12] right that's right hello somebody we're
[35:15] kids human beings that's right but now
[35:18] look my point is I had to go to school
[35:21] sneak under the gym floor and sit there
[35:24] and read that book or look at the
[35:26] pictures
[35:30] all no not Michael but all Michael's got
[35:33] to do right now is pick his phone
[35:36] up flip it over and hit two
[35:40] buttons and he can see the same
[35:42] identical thing times
[35:44] 10,000 sitting right where he's sitting
[35:48] now see the difference I had to go to
[35:51] school sneak under hope somebody didn't
[35:54] steal a thing and and then you you
[35:57] understand what I mean so we had to we
[35:59] had to go make an effort now there is no
[36:01] effort right Satan will put it he's got
[36:03] it in your pocket it's in your pocket
[36:06] now it's in the kids's pocket now
[36:09] without
[36:13] Direction but listen we should not
[36:15] ostracize the people we're
[36:18] humans we're human beings right exactly
[36:22] sorry I didn't mean this to be this way
[36:24] but we're sexual creatures we're
[36:28] curious and we're selfish we want it for
[36:31] oursel amen we've all been through this
[36:35] the problem is a lot of times like what
[36:36] brother Dale said you forgot where you
[36:38] came
[36:40] from you forgot where you came from you
[36:43] forgot you did them little things
[36:45] too so let's don't kill our kids right
[36:49] don't shoot the people we got to love
[36:54] them sorry
[36:57] but that's what our kids are looking at
[36:59] today they're looking at highdefinition
[37:02] and devil HD huge devil they're looking
[37:05] at everything in HD now where we had to
[37:08] you know it was a grain and on a piece
[37:09] of paper and now it's just like boom
[37:12] you're it's
[37:14] there and even when you don't want two
[37:16] kids I know for a fact you go looking
[37:19] through look up something online and all
[37:20] of a sudden Here Comes something pops
[37:23] up and you know what that little temped
[37:26] thing sitting on your shoulder right
[37:28] here is going to say press that button
[37:30] right there they won't nobody know
[37:31] anything about that yeah well God
[37:36] does whether your parents does or not
[37:38] God does so let's go back to how to
[37:40] approach youth camps let's get back to
[37:42] that how'd you get off on that
[37:44] trail all right look Ministry to young
[37:46] people is important because of natural
[37:49] anxieties of their young years we just
[37:51] talked about that the natural
[37:55] anxiety come on
[37:57] now don't get
[37:59] quiet natural anxieties of their young
[38:03] years making the change from a kid to an
[38:05] adult is extremely
[38:08] difficult everyone has to go through it
[38:11] though kids listen we didn't just jump
[38:13] from 4 to
[38:15] 50 we went through the same thing it
[38:17] might not be the high definition you
[38:19] going through but it's the same devil
[38:22] using the same tactic what divide and
[38:24] conquer the same tactic divide get away
[38:27] get we're going to talk about this in
[38:29] dating and stuff if you can't take the
[38:30] boy you're fixing to date home to meet
[38:32] your parents you don't need to date that
[38:35] person man or
[38:37] woman if you have to sneak to see
[38:40] somebody I'd get away from that thing
[38:42] real quick cuz you have a different
[38:45] motive and so does he or she everybody
[38:48] with me all right so the change from kid
[38:51] to adult is extremely difficult everyone
[38:53] has to go through it besides of the
[38:55] inward pressure of growing growing up
[38:57] and want to be liked and accepted that's
[38:59] our problem they want to be liked and
[39:01] accepted everybody wants to be liked cuz
[39:03] you're on Facebook like me like me like
[39:07] me you got to like me how many likes did
[39:09] you get I got 4,000 likes they a't no
[39:12] one of them people know who you
[39:14] are they just like your one picture that
[39:16] you put on line for one
[39:18] second
[39:19] amen so don't put it don't put like
[39:22] being liked by having so many likes on
[39:25] Facebook or Instagram or Twitter
[39:28] wherever you want to do it any kind of
[39:29] social
[39:30] media you ever noticed that I mean you
[39:32] know when we were growing up we were
[39:33] talking about this
[39:35] yesterday when I play football there was
[39:39] um a reporter for the um local paper and
[39:43] he took a good many pictures but I mean
[39:45] it didn't take a
[39:47] lot but now you go to a ball game every
[39:51] person that picks their
[39:53] nose every kid that does something
[39:55] they've all got their cameras
[39:59] out 5,000
[40:02] pictures and then they what posted to
[40:04] Instagram I'm here at the ball game look
[40:08] what's going on here look what we're
[40:10] doing
[40:11] here that selfie I I me me thing but
[40:15] that's a phase they got to go through
[40:17] you and I went through it before we just
[40:19] didn't go through it like that we went
[40:20] through hey they're dumb and I'm not I
[40:22] know what I'm doing right I know what
[40:25] I'm doing right
[40:27] they just wasn't a selfie there every 5
[40:29] Second somebody driving down the road
[40:31] the other day and I thought man we're
[40:32] kind of out in bilding nowhere brother
[40:34] day and I have to look up and there was
[40:35] three cameras on a
[40:37] pole them little Turner you know little
[40:40] little bitty cameras watching everything
[40:42] that you do right so now we're in an age
[40:46] that what it's come to what everything
[40:48] you do there's a reaction to all
[40:52] right so watch
[40:55] this
[40:58] because of the inward pressure of
[40:59] growing up and wanting to be liked and
[41:01] accepted there's a pressure on the
[41:03] outside to make
[41:05] choices contrary to what you may think a
[41:07] youth cries out for clear-cut direction
[41:10] administered with real
[41:12] love deep down inside they may be the
[41:15] most rebellious thing in the world but
[41:18] deep down inside they need your love and
[41:23] affection praise God
[41:26] you need you want it from God right you
[41:29] want that deep love and affection from
[41:30] him give it to your kids yeah but my
[41:33] kids come
[41:35] on your kids are going to do what you
[41:40] did a youth cries out for clear-cut
[41:42] direction administered with real
[41:44] authentic love the more personal
[41:48] understanding they can be given and the
[41:51] more wisdom they receive from Godly
[41:54] sources the better amen
[41:56] brother Brandon recommended a special
[41:58] book for his teenage children to read it
[42:00] was called young only once by Clyde
[42:03] neore if you want to look that up you
[42:05] can look it up because brother brandom
[42:06] put his stamp of approval on it young
[42:09] only once by Clyde naramore it's an
[42:12] excellent book on issues they're going
[42:13] through as a young person now that was
[42:15] back in the
[42:16] 60s all right and this last one Ministry
[42:21] to young people is important because
[42:23] they are the Next
[42:25] Generation what we teach the young
[42:27] automatically affects the
[42:29] future automatically affects the
[42:32] future that's one we've always tried we
[42:35] may have failed a 100,000 times but
[42:37] we've tried to make get the youth
[42:38] involved get the youth to do stuff bring
[42:41] it down to the Youth Level and get have
[42:42] youth meetings and have things like
[42:45] that and I agree with what brother Paul
[42:47] says look if you go to a youth camp and
[42:49] all they do is
[42:51] play that's not what you're there
[42:54] for you're there to hear the the word of
[42:56] God then you can have activities that
[42:58] you
[42:59] do amen like like when we have our youth
[43:03] meeting here we have a youth meeting and
[43:04] then we go and do what we need to do as
[43:07] far as playing or answering questions or
[43:09] or playing games which is fine word
[43:11] comes
[43:12] first word comes first and then all the
[43:15] other activities and and and listen why
[43:18] wouldn't you want them to be around
[43:19] something word
[43:21] based true word
[43:24] based not some
[43:28] psychology everybody all right with this
[43:31] watch
[43:33] this they
[43:35] are it's better to build children than
[43:39] to repair
[43:41] men one more time it is better to build
[43:46] children than to repair
[43:49] men think about that children are like
[43:53] wet
[43:55] cement everybody with me our attention
[43:59] to young people is vital they are in
[44:01] their years of
[44:03] molding I believe the bride of Christ
[44:05] will soon be translated to Glory but
[44:07] until then it's important to make
[44:09] spiritual investments in our
[44:12] youth if God carries they are the church
[44:15] that'll carry the message on to the end
[44:17] to sum it up I want to remind the Church
[44:19] of her responsibility young among them
[44:22] first create an atmosphere of Faith so
[44:25] young people can be born again amen
[44:27] second make sure that the older are
[44:29] teaching the younger in
[44:32] everything by example and by
[44:36] instruction third seek God and
[44:39] understand the needs of the youth that's
[44:42] right well they don't need
[44:44] that whether it be the holy ghost or a
[44:47] wholesome gathering with other young
[44:50] people amen get them to a good youth
[44:53] camp meeting where they preach the pure
[44:54] message don't be against youth camps if
[44:57] they are the right kind right brother La
[45:00] Fontaine said his personal experience
[45:01] started at a youth camp the right
[45:03] atmosphere was there for a birth more
[45:06] than anything else let's be on our knees
[45:08] and pray for these young
[45:10] people like I said before not ostracize
[45:12] them not say well there there just no no
[45:15] hope for them I'm glad somebody didn't
[45:16] say there's no hope for
[45:18] me amen I'm glad I didn't get written
[45:21] off amen I got written
[45:24] in amen
[45:26] amen include not
[45:29] exclude do not
[45:31] separate I know it's listen it's hard to
[45:34] treat if you have like Kaye and Zoe then
[45:38] you
[45:39] got
[45:41] uh Esther and Zach you can't all get
[45:46] them to agree on everything together
[45:48] right Monica she's like oh my word and
[45:51] them two are twins came from came from
[45:54] the same time period and they both one
[45:56] of them's a little older than the other
[45:57] one maybe a few minutes but they think
[45:59] different right amen Zoe is the think
[46:03] well she's left-handed
[46:05] so us left-handed people we're the only
[46:07] people use our right mind so praise the
[46:09] Lord r
[46:10] fra right ain't that right and I told
[46:14] him a long time ago I said I said Zoe's
[46:16] going to be The Quiet One Kay's going to
[46:17] be the one you're going to have trouble
[46:18] with I mean one you're going to have to
[46:22] uh to watch and that's the truth right
[46:26] [Music]
[46:27] no you can say you pass me a note and
[46:30] say
[46:31] yes but you heard what I but now look
[46:34] but see there's an overview though that
[46:35] we come from the message of the hour and
[46:38] we come to the scripture and how to what
[46:41] bring them together and not make them
[46:43] think the same listen I don't want all
[46:45] y'all to think the same thing in here
[46:47] today God's not one like that God's one
[46:50] with
[46:51] variety but they've all got to be as we
[46:54] were talking this morning they they've
[46:55] all got to be the mind of Christ not the
[46:57] mind of the devil and say well we're
[46:59] going to take that no it's all under the
[47:01] mind of Christ all right I know it's
[47:03] tough to raise
[47:05] kids
[47:07] but get some
[47:10] help if you're overwhel to the kids get
[47:12] some help amen somewhere somehow what
[47:15] you smiling about your mom and dad needs
[47:17] a lot of help I know
[47:20] that but you watch these you watch these
[47:23] grow up and you think man
[47:27] I wish I had got mine that
[47:30] early
[47:33] Freedom man' Brother Gary all of us I
[47:36] wish we'd have got ours
[47:38] earlier and done just a few things
[47:41] different amen we all question that but
[47:44] listen as long as there's sucking air
[47:47] there's a chance
[47:49] amen as long as they're breathing
[47:52] there's a chance and you know what I'm
[47:54] going to claim them it doesn't matter
[47:55] what cuz you know what God claimed me
[47:57] and you doesn't matter
[48:02] what remember what I said this morning
[48:04] is when we start adding ourself and our
[48:07] attitude into it yeah so how do you
[48:11] approach youth camps I enjoy them I like
[48:13] them I'm glad some of you are going to
[48:15] uh to support it and to be counselors me
[48:17] and June we were for eight years at
[48:20] Alabama it was the very week of our
[48:24] anniversary and we say goodbye on Friday
[48:26] and hello on Monday that was it well we
[48:28] didn't get to see each other the whole
[48:29] weekend cuz we had your kids to deal
[48:32] with and about 600 other kids to deal
[48:34] with but we enjoyed it brother boy and
[48:36] Sister Janet same way and some of you
[48:39] other ones that were
[48:40] there but being a
[48:44] counselor didn't mean just being one
[48:46] weekend
[48:47] though you got to be that
[48:50] 24/7 be that to your kids I don't care
[48:53] if they 60 years old or 50 years old or
[48:55] 20 years old or whatever and still be be
[48:58] their counselor and listen it's okay to
[49:00] be their friend but you still got to be
[49:01] their
[49:02] parent cuz here we go with the friend
[49:05] and the friend lets him get along with
[49:07] no you can't do that bring it back to
[49:09] the middle and teach them the ways of
[49:12] God and listen don't
[49:16] compromise don't
[49:19] compromise now just for an example y'all
[49:21] know you know what Hannah is my daughter

[50:24] hairbrush so we didn't we didn't say any

[53:20] for Josh and Hannah to stay so we sent
[53:22] them over to Nanny's house at last in

[53:55] Hanah right behind
[53:58] them they went and live somewhere I
[54:00] don't know where they went live but but
[54:02] you know why cuz they didn't want to do
[54:04] what they was
[54:05] told but it's a learning experience now
[54:08] cuz Josh is the same way with Josh is
[54:10] like yeah de is going to do the same
[54:13] thing but you see what I'm talking about
[54:15] raising
[54:16] kids give them
[54:19] parameters so I give Hannah parameter I
[54:21] said look you can't bring nothing in
[54:23] here this evil no drinking no smoking
[54:26] and she smokes but she smokes outside
[54:28] I'm just telling you real life I'm sorry

[54:31] family but she don't bring it in the
[54:34] house I'll let her live
[54:36] there she makes good money now she going
[54:38] to start paying rent she just don't know
[54:39] that yet she's not watching in so we're
[54:42] going to tell her later we'll tell her
[54:43] later she's at work actually right now
[54:45] but anyway so so are you going to throw
[54:47] them out no but I'm not going to allow
[54:49] that stuff to happen in my
[54:51] castle right and if they don't if they
[54:54] don't want to do do that they can leave
[54:56] then amen I told to my kids were like
[54:58] boomerangs you throw them out they come
[55:00] back you throw them out they come back
[55:01] you throw them out they come
[55:03] back how many of y'all have ever had
[55:05] that but Gary Brother
[55:08] [Laughter]
[55:15] G it's really sad no really what's
[55:18] really sad is now though that the Youth
[55:20] of this age they'll go and they'll lay
[55:23] with anybody in the world and have kids
[55:26] and the poor Grandma's raising them and
[55:29] Grandpa
[55:31] Freedom that to me that's horrible you
[55:34] should not have a 60y old woman taking
[55:38] care of a seveny old kid you can't keep
[55:40] up with
[55:41] them but that's what the world's full of
[55:44] cuz you know
[55:46] what oh he's a problem child I don't
[55:48] want to talk I don't want him no I don't
[55:50] want that no no you had them yes right
[55:53] brother D said you had fun having them
[55:54] you you going to have fun raising
[55:58] them praise the Lord those of you will
[56:00] understand that later on I
[56:11] hope Family Matters I guess I don't know
[56:15] I can hear them in Ohio They're laughing
[56:16] like crazy cuz they never heard that
[56:17] part before I don't
[56:20] think so thank you Lord how to approach
[56:24] a youth camp you should send them you
[56:27] should encourage them to go you should
[56:29] encourage your kids to do anything
[56:31] that's worthy of of of God helping them
[56:36] and even playing sports I don't have a
[56:38] mind of people not of playing sports I
[56:41] we daddy like to got throw out of the
[56:43] message me and ter play basketball and
[56:45] we graduated high
[56:48] school and look Anna was really a siner
[56:51] she went to college well so did I in
[56:53] Terence but I we didn't stay
[56:55] but but that's the way the message was
[56:57] though you get 16 years old get the kids
[56:59] out of school put them to work CU
[57:00] education of the devil they just didn't
[57:03] realize brother ROM all his kids
[57:04] graduated high school and one of them
[57:05] went to school went to
[57:07] college education is of the devil if
[57:10] you'll let it
[57:11] be you know what anything's of the devil
[57:14] if you let it be but education and I
[57:17] understand what he's talking about this
[57:18] liberal junk that they teaching now yeah
[57:20] you shouldn't teach your kids that you
[57:21] should homeschool them if you need to
[57:24] amen
[57:26] but I believe that a good education will
[57:28] help you how many times have we told you
[57:30] get a good
[57:31] education cuz you going to need it
[57:33] further your education if you can and if
[57:36] Sports gets you there that's fine if
[57:38] getting scholarships gets there that may
[57:40] that's fine but get you an education a
[57:42] good
[57:43] education amen
[57:45] amen all right are we good with that so
[57:48] how to approach the Youth Camp I'd send
[57:49] them and if you kids are going which a
[57:52] lot 12 of you are going to to the bethl
[57:54] camp
[57:55] have a good
[57:57] time visit people there's some people
[58:00] there you already
[58:02] know but let the Lord do something in
[58:04] your life
[58:06] first and then all these other things
[58:08] will work theirself
[58:10] out and you might meet Mr
[58:12] R but he's got to go through me
[58:16] first huh
[58:22] yeah ain't that right
[58:27] right if you meet Mr Wright that's okay
[58:30] and that's what we're going to talk
[58:31] about next the next thing somebody asked
[58:34] about the dos and don'ts of courting so
[58:36] this kind of all goes
[58:37] together the dos and don'ts of courting
[58:39] now I was looking up something brother
[58:41] brandham never said the word dating
[58:45] right if you'll look it up on put dating
[58:47] in on your fio views he never mentioned
[58:51] dating it was always
[58:53] courtship
[58:55] okay or he might have said went on a
[58:57] date but he's talking about when you say
[58:59] dating that means he talked about that
[59:01] subject he never talked about the
[59:02] subject dating because listen dating and
[59:05] courtship are different as night and
[59:09] day dating is way different than
[59:13] courtship cuz what dating is I looked
[59:16] this up a little bit online and I did
[59:18] look what brother m talked about
[59:20] courtship dating it there's no clear
[59:23] purpose of what you're doing you're
[59:24] you're just going out on a date maybe
[59:27] missed the right maybe missed the wrong
[59:28] you better find out real
[59:30] quick but the dos and don'ts of dating
[59:33] you got to start somewhere yes everybody
[59:36] with me you got to start somewhere
[59:38] brother brandham even had to what had to
[59:40] court or start dating remember he had to
[59:42] go ask what's his name Mr BR brombeck or
[59:45] whatever her name was Hope's last name
[59:48] was had to ask him if he could date them
[59:50] see that's a good guy yeah and they
[59:53] courted and then they got married all
[59:55] right so me was the same way brother
[59:57] Brown didn't just up and God just says
[1:00:00] like a chest piece here's your
[1:00:04] queen
[1:00:06] right he did
[1:00:16] me I didn't get any amens out of
[1:00:20] that not a one not a
[1:00:23] one amen
[1:00:25] amen but that's what you got to do
[1:00:27] though you as human beings you you're
[1:00:30] just not going to know exactly who your
[1:00:33] mate is from the
[1:00:36] get-go he's the
[1:00:38] one no he's the one for the
[1:00:41] moment everybody with me you got to get
[1:00:45] to know that person but you got to get
[1:00:47] to know that person under the
[1:00:50] supervision of your
[1:00:52] parents everybody with me
[1:00:55] I think we covered this a little bit
[1:00:56] many years ago when we were doing the U
[1:00:59] um what was it family matters uh but I'm
[1:01:02] going to do it a little bit more in
[1:01:05] depth because dating there's no clear
[1:01:06] purpose you just say well I'm going
[1:01:07] going to date all right but then now
[1:01:11] courtship has a different end than
[1:01:15] dating courtship is a little
[1:01:17] more brother R talks he says it's a it's
[1:01:21] on the basis of an agreement now he does
[1:01:22] talk about courtship but he courtship
[1:01:25] and puts it in with the way we Court
[1:01:27] Jesus Christ the way that we come
[1:01:29] together in a courtship with the Lord
[1:01:31] Jesus all
[1:01:33] right cuz it's not a marriage first it's
[1:01:37] justification
[1:01:38] sanctification and then the baptism of
[1:01:40] the Holy Ghost so you don't get married
[1:01:42] right at the GetGo even with Jesus
[1:01:44] Christ even though you know that he's
[1:01:46] the one you know you still got to go
[1:01:48] through uh uh justification and
[1:01:50] sanctification same way with your with
[1:01:52] your dating you know you may have have
[1:01:54] to date some
[1:01:56] person but man I'm talking about I'm
[1:01:58] talking about just going and sitting and
[1:02:00] talking or maybe go you know go get a uh
[1:02:03] Chick-fil-A or something like that the
[1:02:04] reason I said that is cu you should be
[1:02:05] on church on Sunday and Chick-fil-A
[1:02:06] ain't open on Sunday so anyway that's
[1:02:10] right praise the
[1:02:12] Lord see I work that in pretty good huh
[1:02:15] so yeah thank you pretty slick every
[1:02:17] once in a while but go sit down and talk
[1:02:20] and just Converse see listen a lot of
[1:02:24] y'all do that anyway
[1:02:25] online
[1:02:27] right
[1:02:29] right this is yes
[1:02:35] okay but no you you do you start and you
[1:02:38] at least you get to know
[1:02:40] somebody
[1:02:43] right so going on a
[1:02:47] date it has like no clear purpose it has
[1:02:50] no clear end there's not a journey in
[1:02:53] dating
[1:02:54] it should be extremely
[1:02:57] short you should know your parents
[1:03:00] should like I said before if you say Dad
[1:03:02] I'm going on a date well where what's
[1:03:05] your
[1:03:10] name well what does she look like where
[1:03:12] where she from well we're just going you
[1:03:14] know no if you can't bring that person
[1:03:16] to beat your mom and daddy you shouldn't
[1:03:19] be seeing them you should not be alone
[1:03:22] now that dude might want to come and sit
[1:03:24] down with us in the in the in the living
[1:03:26] room and have a conversation I want to
[1:03:28] see if he's a good Hunter cuz I'm going
[1:03:30] to have my gun there and um cleaning it
[1:03:34] and might accidentally Let It Go off I
[1:03:36] don't
[1:03:40] know actually ain't that funny though
[1:03:43] when we got girls you like I'm so
[1:03:44] protective than your boys you're like
[1:03:46] I'm going on Dat that
[1:03:48] yeah that's just the way we are though
[1:03:52] you know with a girl you like put you
[1:03:54] put the barb wire around her you know
[1:03:56] but the guy you're like hey get up go on
[1:03:58] a date would
[1:03:59] you that's way it happens I'm sorry
[1:04:03] Michael we're just wired different
[1:04:06] everybody okay my I'll get to this point
[1:04:09] in just a
[1:04:10] minute brother Ram says in Fellowship
[1:04:13] 1960 he said now he's talking about
[1:04:16] Christ now but when we want courtship
[1:04:18] and things like that it has to come upon
[1:04:20] a basis of an agreement so if you start
[1:04:22] and you want to see this person again
[1:04:25] all right if you think well man he's
[1:04:28] he's like brother Brown said don't do
[1:04:29] the well he smells
[1:04:31] good he's got what was he talking about
[1:04:33] that girl got neck like a swan and
[1:04:36] all look at their character have we not
[1:04:40] been talking about character look at the
[1:04:43] character brother Dell always told us he
[1:04:46] said
[1:04:47] beauty is only skin
[1:04:50] deep but ugly goes to the Bone right and
[1:04:54] that's exactly right well y'all laugh if
[1:04:57] you want to and take it any way you want
[1:04:58] to I believe it's the
[1:05:00] truth I mean there are some beautiful
[1:05:03] girls out there that you would not want
[1:05:04] to
[1:05:05] marry cuz they ugly on the inside same
[1:05:09] way with guys oh brother brandom he
[1:05:12] slicks his hair back remember he talk to
[1:05:14] the girl and said why you dating that
[1:05:15] guy why you he just smells so good he
[1:05:18] got his hair slit back into a duck tail
[1:05:20] that was the thing back then just look
[1:05:21] it up if you need to all right back in
[1:05:24] the 60s you had a duct tail or you had a
[1:05:25] flat top you know and you drove a car
[1:05:28] and you rolled your sleeves up and if
[1:05:29] you smoked you put the cigarettes in
[1:05:30] your sleeve I don't know why in the
[1:05:32] world people do that but that was what
[1:05:34] you look for in that area the end this
[1:05:36] area is just wide
[1:05:38] open how many tattoos you
[1:05:41] got I ain't going to ask about the
[1:05:43] piercing
[1:05:45] part but it's all it's different so we
[1:05:47] we we're coming up today though where
[1:05:49] you really got to hone in and you got to
[1:05:51] if you want to date somebody you got to
[1:05:53] go through a process
[1:05:55] yes first name Mama second name
[1:05:59] daddy amen that's the only two processes
[1:06:02] you got but when you decide say for an
[1:06:07] example that where's mil and
[1:06:11] M not you Michael T see so Michael meets
[1:06:16] this young lady I hope she's younger
[1:06:18] than him young
[1:06:20] lady and he decides you I can use you
[1:06:23] right it's okay nothing bad maybe um
[1:06:27] I'll turn the thing off I me you talk
[1:06:29] back and
[1:06:30] forth but anyway let's just say Micha
[1:06:32] going meet somebody and he Tes her to to
[1:06:34] to milka's house and he say hey Mom this
[1:06:36] is somebody that I
[1:06:38] really you know we got a little bit in
[1:06:40] common here and milka's like fangs come
[1:06:48] out she does that right there and it's
[1:06:50] like it's like um it's like
[1:06:53] the
[1:06:55] like the Wolverine you know all these
[1:06:58] things come
[1:06:59] out let me meet
[1:07:01] her you should already brought her to
[1:07:03] begin with but anyway no he's got she
[1:07:06] she's got to through go through
[1:07:08] Mama she's got to go through mom and dad
[1:07:12] he's got to go through mom and
[1:07:14] dad you say oh I don't have to go
[1:07:16] through that preacher well just let me
[1:07:18] let me see how your end is going to
[1:07:21] be let me see how the end of this
[1:07:24] conversation is going to be get married
[1:07:27] two years later you're divorced cuz you
[1:07:28] didn't get to know him to begin with
[1:07:31] everybody with
[1:07:32] me so courting is different than dating
[1:07:37] and listen you can get a bad reputation
[1:07:40] by dating every Tom Dick and Harry that
[1:07:42] lives that's right male or female right
[1:07:47] right because what are you looking for
[1:07:50] well brother wait I got no you pray yeah
[1:07:55] you pray and then cross paths with
[1:07:58] somebody that's right and when you cross
[1:08:00] paths with that person you either
[1:08:03] say let them go
[1:08:06] [Laughter]
[1:08:14] on only only
[1:08:16] Freedom let them go
[1:08:19] on right or you want to see them again
[1:08:23] well when you do do that then that may
[1:08:25] be clicking close to the courton part
[1:08:26] but you got to take them to Mom and Dad
[1:08:27] you got to go through the Hall of
[1:08:28] critics first any remember brother talks
[1:08:31] about the Hall of critic and promise you
[1:08:33] mom and daddy is going to be the most
[1:08:34] critical people in the
[1:08:35] world
[1:08:37] Amen besides me for some of
[1:08:42] y'all but because courtship is getting a
[1:08:44] little more serious courtship there is
[1:08:47] an end to
[1:08:48] courtship right when you get into
[1:08:51] courtship you're already discussing
[1:08:53] things
[1:08:55] amen listen to what brother Brown says
[1:08:58] we take for instance the marriage for a
[1:09:01] union look now watch we find out that
[1:09:04] the marriage we find the courtship and
[1:09:07] the agreements and then the
[1:09:09] marriage everybody with me now that's
[1:09:13] the same thing with Christ and the
[1:09:14] church a courtship God calling to our
[1:09:18] heart we
[1:09:20] surrender the marriage ceremony happens
[1:09:23] and the bride takes the bridegroom's
[1:09:26] name that's what makes the bride then we
[1:09:29] take on his name same way with what
[1:09:32] courtship agreements then marriage so
[1:09:36] courtship has a specific end which is
[1:09:38] marriage parents should be involved in
[1:09:40] every bit of that
[1:09:43] amen that's when you kids you got to
[1:09:45] realize your parents know more than you
[1:09:50] do but that's the that's the whole time
[1:09:53] you're going to say nope I'm married
[1:09:55] that girl I don't care what nobody says
[1:09:57] well that's okay we'll see how that
[1:10:00] ends listen if not by the grace of
[1:10:04] God we'd all made a
[1:10:07] horrible horrible
[1:10:09] mistake in our
[1:10:12] life if not for the Providence of God
[1:10:15] knowing and I'm telling knowing that I
[1:10:17] need somebody like
[1:10:19] her can make it
[1:10:22] through that's the Providence of God
[1:10:25] that's God knowing what you need before
[1:10:28] you need it but you yield yourself to it
[1:10:30] because you know the story behind all
[1:10:31] this you know I was dating somebody else
[1:10:34] and she was going to church
[1:10:38] and getting in trouble by telling these
[1:10:42] stories but anyway make a long story
[1:10:44] short Jim didn't go to church come
[1:10:46] showed up with you know smelling like
[1:10:47] cigarette smoke wearing shorty
[1:10:50] shorts ha short hair too and mama said
[1:10:54] what in the
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:03] world looking out for me dumb old
[1:11:08] me Dearing the headlights you know swep
[1:11:12] off my feet wasn't even looking for her
[1:11:14] y'all know the story most of you know
[1:11:16] the story she's one that was said she
[1:11:17] was going to knock me off my feet I was
[1:11:20] the football player you know they knock
[1:11:22] me off my feet well 3 weeks later I got
[1:11:24] knock top my feet so anyway so mom's
[1:11:27] like what in the
[1:11:28] world here you got this girl that you're
[1:11:34] dating have I understand Janet
[1:11:39] does but and and it seems like that's
[1:11:43] the way it should have been that's why
[1:11:45] I'm telling you everything is not cut
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] dry cuz to look at it from the
[1:11:49] peripheral I should have never married
[1:11:52] her I had no
[1:11:54] business but look at the Providence of
[1:11:57] God right that's what I needed folks I
[1:11:59] didn't need the others same way with you
[1:12:02] you should know that you needed your
[1:12:04] husband or your husband needs you and
[1:12:06] that's why you're together that's why
[1:12:08] we've been together for 43 years had our
[1:12:10] ups and downs but you know what we're
[1:12:12] going to be in eternity
[1:12:16] together so I'm fine with
[1:12:18] that I'm fine with that that's okay with
[1:12:21] me how the Providence of God but see it
[1:12:23] doesn't always work that way though
[1:12:24] because how many people have been in
[1:12:27] train wrecks don't you don't have to
[1:12:29] hold your hands up put your hand down
[1:12:31] you have to hold your hand up but I mean
[1:12:33] a lot of people have been in train
[1:12:34] wrecks you know what I mean this is him
[1:12:37] this is her got to
[1:12:40] be and it don't work out cu you didn't
[1:12:43] put God first that's right and I didn't
[1:12:46] put God first but God put me first he
[1:12:49] knew I needed you he knew I needed
[1:12:52] her no nobody else in this world fits
[1:12:54] the mold like she fits the
[1:12:56] mold so that's what I I thank
[1:13:00] God I
[1:13:03] do and we courted for about a year and a
[1:13:06] half and um pretty much from what I can
[1:13:09] read that different ministers that
[1:13:11] that's about as long as it needs to be
[1:13:14] if you're a Believer and really it don't
[1:13:16] need to be that long because you know if
[1:13:18] you start courting here we go back to
[1:13:19] getting human
[1:13:22] again right I hope you adults understand
[1:13:25] what I'm talking about as you keep
[1:13:27] getting FR you say well we're I
[1:13:31] mean got the ring yeah got the ring you
[1:13:35] know what Gary Lor always told us when
[1:13:37] we were at Youth Camp he'd said if you
[1:13:39] don't have a ring on your finger you
[1:13:41] might can sit together but no
[1:13:44] touching and he really discouraged the
[1:13:47] sitting together right cuz you're
[1:13:49] touching leg to leg skin to skin maybe a
[1:13:51] little elbow smash or something You Know
[1:13:53] M he said now if you got the engagement
[1:13:56] ring on your finger and you come to this
[1:13:58] Youth Camp cuz it was for people that
[1:14:01] weren't married and a lot some of them
[1:14:03] were engaged he said you can hold
[1:14:06] hands that's
[1:14:08] it I mean even if the people got up and
[1:14:10] went to the bathroom we were instructed
[1:14:12] to go to the bathroom with
[1:14:14] them cuz some of your kids do the same
[1:14:17] thing they disappear for 15 minutes back
[1:14:19] there if you got a bad problem 15
[1:14:20] minutes you can't go to the bathroom you
[1:14:22] need prayer yeah
[1:14:25] you know what you're doing you're hiding
[1:14:26] from
[1:14:31] God you're hiding from the spirit that
[1:14:33] comes into the church which is a good
[1:14:35] one and yours may not
[1:14:37] be I'm saying sorry if I become your
[1:14:40] enemy because I told you the
[1:14:42] truth the only way you won't stay in
[1:14:44] this Sanctuary is you got a bad
[1:14:46] Spirit hello
[1:14:48] somebody you're running from
[1:14:52] something
[1:14:54] that's
[1:14:55] true all right let's get back to
[1:14:57] courtship just for a minute we everybody
[1:14:59] all right it may go a little long I'm
[1:15:01] sorry but I'm going to answer all these
[1:15:02] questions because they're good
[1:15:05] questions now look you must seek the
[1:15:07] approval of your parents look if you
[1:15:09] can't introduce that person to your
[1:15:12] parents he or she is not a keeper
[1:15:16] right what's the first thing you well
[1:15:19] they want to prove of her well they want
[1:15:21] to prove of why yeah tell me why they
[1:15:25] want to prove of or you ask
[1:15:28] yourself why am I ashamed to bring them
[1:15:30] to my
[1:15:33] parents everybody okay that's it Are you
[1:15:37] ashamed of somebody you might want to
[1:15:39] live with for the rest of your
[1:15:41] life and
[1:15:43] listen everybody's got a mother-in-law
[1:15:46] that's
[1:15:49] married I had
[1:15:51] two a real one in step
[1:15:54] one loved them both they live far
[1:16:03] away what am I saying once you once you
[1:16:06] I like what a brother said one time he
[1:16:07] said it's not just binding two people
[1:16:10] together it's binding two
[1:16:13] families and this family and this family
[1:16:16] may not know each
[1:16:17] other say you met somebody
[1:16:20] from Arizona
[1:16:26] never met brother Lis and Sister
[1:16:27] Christine maybe you talked on the phone
[1:16:29] or something but you got to mold two
[1:16:31] families together then and you might
[1:16:33] have two separate total opinions but you
[1:16:36] still got to bring and overcome all that
[1:16:38] you got to bring it together cuz see my
[1:16:40] June's side of the family never were
[1:16:42] Believers and my side was that didn't
[1:16:44] make us no better than the rest of them
[1:16:46] but it didn't make us to have a
[1:16:47] different
[1:16:48] mindset cuz they always wanted to party
[1:16:50] and drink and smoke and do all this and
[1:16:53] you know we didn't want to do that so it
[1:16:55] kind of made a a separation but they
[1:16:58] understood one thing was for sure we
[1:16:59] weren't going to compromise with
[1:17:01] them everybody with me don't compromise
[1:17:05] just to be somebody's friend that's not
[1:17:07] a friend if you have to compromise your
[1:17:10] values boys and girls men and women
[1:17:13] they're not your
[1:17:14] friends they are your enemy they will
[1:17:17] become your worst
[1:17:19] friend just putting that out
[1:17:21] there all right
[1:17:24] let me read a few more of these bear
[1:17:27] with me
[1:17:29] okay men and women who choose to date
[1:17:32] often have no commitment to consider
[1:17:33] marrying the other person but in
[1:17:37] contrast courtship is undertaken only
[1:17:40] when both parties are prepared to make a
[1:17:42] commitment to marriage yes all
[1:17:48] right dating tries to answer the
[1:17:50] question how can I find the one one who
[1:17:53] make me happy courtship strives to
[1:17:56] answer that question how can I honor God
[1:17:59] and discern his Direction recording my a
[1:18:01] life partner all right so that's the
[1:18:03] difference in your in dating and that
[1:18:06] but I want to I want to get something
[1:18:08] and it's got a little bit to do marriage
[1:18:09] and divorce but I said it was but this
[1:18:11] is this is uh vanilla all right
[1:18:14] everybody with me
[1:18:16] watch brother Brown says we've seen it
[1:18:19] St in the
[1:18:20] East cuz I want you to look at something
[1:18:23] because dating girls and boys when you
[1:18:25] date that's okay that's not a committal
[1:18:27] but when you come to a place of
[1:18:29] courtship and you start talking about
[1:18:31] getting engaged you're work you're
[1:18:33] working on some territory that that you
[1:18:36] either got to make it jump into it or
[1:18:39] you got to not do it at
[1:18:41] all brother brandham says I got two
[1:18:43] quotes right here and that's why I want
[1:18:46] us to understand and I'm going to be
[1:18:48] real plain everybody with me sex doesn't
[1:18:51] make you married right the union between
[1:18:55] a man and a woman does not make you
[1:18:56] married that's right that's not it
[1:18:58] brother R said that's not it what
[1:19:00] marries you your vow is what marries you
[1:19:05] once you vow yourself to that person
[1:19:07] you're just as married now there steps
[1:19:09] you got to go through to be lawfully
[1:19:10] married the bed undefiled and God what
[1:19:13] God will honor that
[1:19:15] marriage everybody with me but to sex
[1:19:17] having sex you said well we're married
[1:19:19] no you're not married you're not married
[1:19:21] to The Vow the committal that's right
[1:19:24] let me read it right
[1:19:26] here everybody okay now I'd like to pass
[1:19:30] this on this is from we have seen this
[1:19:32] star in the east in
[1:19:35] 1963 now I'd like to pass this on before
[1:19:37] we go further is espousing he's talking
[1:19:40] about marrying Joseph because this is a
[1:19:41] Christmas
[1:19:42] message the Bible said he did yes sir
[1:19:45] now Joseph was a good man he was the son
[1:19:47] of David and he was the spouse to Mary
[1:19:50] now I'd like to pass this on before we
[1:19:52] go further espousing in the East was the
[1:19:54] same as marriage is betral now watch as
[1:19:58] soon as they were espoused they were
[1:20:01] married when that sacred vow was taken
[1:20:04] he said read
[1:20:06] Deuteronomy they were
[1:20:08] married when that sacred vow between
[1:20:10] them was taken read Deuteronomy
[1:20:12] 22:23 and you'll find out that when this
[1:20:15] woman and man agreed to be married yet
[1:20:17] they didn't take the vow for months
[1:20:18] later if they even broke that vow they
[1:20:21] were guilty of adultery
[1:20:23] so it's your vow if you promise to marry
[1:20:26] somebody you need to do
[1:20:30] that your vow is what marries
[1:20:33] you I'm reading what the quote says also
[1:20:36] read Deuteronomy there's several
[1:20:37] different things Deuteronomy and the
[1:20:38] Book of Numbers has certain things about
[1:20:40] vows if a man vow vow or a woman vow vow
[1:20:43] if a woman vow vow and she's heard for
[1:20:45] if her parents hear they can disallow
[1:20:47] The Vow because what the husband is the
[1:20:49] or the father is the head but if he
[1:20:51] allows it to happen he can't 6 months
[1:20:53] later going no I don't want you to marry
[1:20:55] that guy no if he says yes then you're
[1:20:57] done everybody with
[1:21:00] me all right
[1:21:03] look when they were espoused they were
[1:21:06] just the same as
[1:21:07] marriage the law doesn't give them a
[1:21:09] right to live together as husband and
[1:21:11] wife yet but before God when they
[1:21:13] promised one another their words were
[1:21:15] sealed in God's kingdom and to break
[1:21:18] that was committing
[1:21:19] adultery do I need to read anything else
[1:21:22] brother Brown we were married this is
[1:21:24] the question's answer we were married 21
[1:21:26] years by the justice of the peace was it
[1:21:27] wrong yes it was wrong for you to do
[1:21:29] that marriage belongs in the house of
[1:21:31] God but being that you are married
[1:21:34] here's when you're really married you're
[1:21:36] married when you vow one to the other do
[1:21:40] I need to read anymore you're
[1:21:42] vowed one to the
[1:21:45] other not the other everybody with me
[1:21:49] all right so dos and Don of dating
[1:21:53] dating you better do it just a very
[1:21:54] short period of time pray like
[1:21:56] crazy and bring them home with
[1:22:00] you and parents it's okay to have a date
[1:22:03] night go with
[1:22:06] them make them buy you something to eat
[1:22:09] you've been feeding them for 20
[1:22:12] years
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:16] right let them buy you dinner you'll
[1:22:19] find out real quick if they want to be
[1:22:21] your and you be around them or or them
[1:22:24] be around you or not everybody all right
[1:22:26] with this all right we got a couple
[1:22:30] more well we got three more is it wrong
[1:22:33] to pray for your team to win when
[1:22:34] playing a game such as football now
[1:22:36] somebody we'd laugh about that but let
[1:22:38] me tell you what brother Brown said
[1:22:39] about that everybody want an
[1:22:41] answer all right here we go the
[1:22:44] influence of another 1962 this is right
[1:22:46] about time of the seal so it's
[1:22:51] okay you know what what I think I'm
[1:22:53] reading verbatim everybody has their own
[1:22:57] opinion but one of the greatest and to
[1:22:59] my opinion the greatest president ever
[1:23:01] was in a nation was Abraham Lincoln now
[1:23:04] not because he was a republican not
[1:23:06] because he was what he was no it was
[1:23:08] because what he was he was a godly man
[1:23:11] and he was raised to serve God and he
[1:23:13] said if there is anything I want to give
[1:23:15] praise to or my life was influenced by
[1:23:18] was a Godly mother who taught me to pray
[1:23:20] and know Jesus as my savior
[1:23:23] right all your family is what you are
[1:23:26] you raise your kids in a certain
[1:23:28] environment it's got a 98% better chance
[1:23:31] to go right than it has if you bring
[1:23:33] them up in the wrong way parental
[1:23:36] delinquency bring up a child in the way
[1:23:39] that it should go and when it's old will
[1:23:41] not depart from it be brought up right
[1:23:44] teach your children to do right to be
[1:23:46] honest to be square and fair even when
[1:23:49] they're in
[1:23:50] school so here we go
[1:23:53] ready this is paragraph 39 for those of
[1:23:55] you that may want to look this up and
[1:23:58] read
[1:23:58] it this is everybody believe brother
[1:24:00] Brown was a prophet right okay all right
[1:24:04] now many times children are prone to

[1:24:58] it'll turn the
[1:25:02] tide remember we can have what we want
[1:25:05] if we will ask in faith believing Jesus
[1:25:08] said all things are possible to them
[1:25:11] that will believe you have not because
[1:25:13] you ask not and you ask not because you
[1:25:16] believe not he said ask abundant that

[1:25:23] our teaching right say the right thing
[1:25:26] do the right thing think the right thing
[1:25:28] always be thinking right I have a little
[1:25:30] slogan do right that's your duty to God

[1:25:36] yourself H and you're bound to come out
[1:25:39] right you can't be going east and west
[1:25:41] at the same time you can't be going

[1:25:47] the other way if you're traveling
[1:25:49] directly west you're not going to ever
[1:25:51] get to East if you're going west so he's
[1:25:54] talking about a test so we always prayed
[1:25:56] at our of course you can't do that now I

[1:26:17] safe that's the way I would
[1:26:20] pray regardless list who wins or not I
[1:26:23] don't think that matters to God but it
[1:26:26] does matter for them to use their talent
[1:26:30] and not be hurt and to not get in
[1:26:32] trouble amen why wouldn't we pray over

[1:32:57] ask you for it okay when we involve our
[1:33:01] own opinion is where we get in trouble
[1:33:02] we hurt feelings and all that other
[1:33:04] stuff all right I read that this morning
[1:33:06] I think in the message we start
[1:33:08] interjecting oursel in it all right now
[1:33:11] listen here's the next
[1:33:14] question this is a good
[1:33:17] one brother brandham
[1:33:20] said that man had to
[1:33:24] fall for God to manifest his attributes
[1:33:28] to be a
[1:33:29] savior he also said that man couldn't
[1:33:33] fall because he was made in the image of
[1:33:35] God talking about Genesis 12627
[1:33:40] man so God had to make a byproduct which
[1:33:44] was
[1:33:45] Eve but if the byproduct was able to be
[1:33:49] deceived how could Adam and Eve
[1:33:52] be
[1:33:53] co-equal if one could fall and the other
[1:33:57] one
[1:33:58] couldn't Bob this one's for
[1:34:03] you don't laugh Louise you got the next
[1:34:06] one Aaron you got the last
[1:34:10] one that's a good question so the only
[1:34:13] way I can answer is is let let brother
[1:34:15] brandom try to answer it for us okay so
[1:34:17] let's look at questions and answers in
[1:34:20] 1954 watch what brother Bram
[1:34:23] says all things of Shadows and types
[1:34:27] when God made the heavens and the Earth
[1:34:29] he made the moon to shine in the absence
[1:34:31] of the sun to give light while the sun
[1:34:33] was gone see a beautiful type of Christ
[1:34:36] in the church the church is the Moon to
[1:34:39] give the light to the world while the
[1:34:41] sun is
[1:34:42] gone see what I mean a lesser light see
[1:34:46] and then otherwise the moon and the sun
[1:34:48] is husband and wife as Christ in the
[1:34:51] church as husband and wife the wife
[1:34:54] being the weaker
[1:34:56] vessel all right only gives a smaller
[1:34:59] light in the absence of her
[1:35:02] husband now everybody knows that God's a
[1:35:06] male God's a male we are his body which
[1:35:10] is the female now who's the
[1:35:14] weakest we are all right so the type
[1:35:18] continues all the way through when he
[1:35:19] made the sun and the moon when he made
[1:35:21] male and female created he them even in
[1:35:25] theophany
[1:35:26] hello but when he put them in flesh he
[1:35:29] knew that was going to fall but they
[1:35:31] didn't fall when Adam was had even in
[1:35:33] her and him it's when but he had to
[1:35:36] separate
[1:35:37] him cuz male and female created he them
[1:35:41] so when he took the feminist part what
[1:35:43] the feelings the
[1:35:48] emotions right took them out of Adam
[1:35:51] yeah and put him in
[1:35:52] Eve Adam still had the masculine he was
[1:35:55] the type of
[1:35:56] Christ right Christ is the husband we
[1:36:00] are the wife he is the head we are the
[1:36:03] body who's the weakest the head or the
[1:36:06] body no the body is the weakest amen
[1:36:09] natural and spiritual I mean really
[1:36:11] we're the body of Christ and yeah we're
[1:36:13] going to we're heading towards
[1:36:14] something but we're still the weaker
[1:36:17] vessel cuz we lean to
[1:36:19] emotion even as the Bride of Jesus
[1:36:21] Christ we lean to emotion more than we
[1:36:24] do this is the word of God that's why
[1:36:27] your headship though in a church as
[1:36:29] brother Dale has been for years and
[1:36:31] years and years he's the male you're the
[1:36:35] female he's the male you're me us or the
[1:36:39] female right because Christ is the head
[1:36:42] but he uses the pastor as headship
[1:36:46] because you're the weaker vessel
[1:36:50] because
[1:36:53] it's been about a year and a
[1:36:56] half and we're definitely the weaker
[1:36:59] vessel brother Dell is a strong
[1:37:01] individual goodness gracious
[1:37:08] yeah and he's wore himself out worried
[1:37:10] about
[1:37:11] y'all and when I say y'all I
[1:37:15] mean
[1:37:18] y'all
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:22] so we're the weaker vessel your pastor
[1:37:26] has to stand in what
[1:37:30] Moses kill them
[1:37:32] all i'll kill them all God said I'm
[1:37:34] taking every one of them out and we
[1:37:35] start all over
[1:37:36] again the pastor jumps out from around
[1:37:39] the pull pit say if you're going to take
[1:37:40] them you got to take me
[1:37:43] first God said get out of the way son
[1:37:46] I'm going to destroy this
[1:37:48] world Jesus said you got to destroy me
[1:37:50] first
[1:37:52] you got to take me
[1:37:54] first I'm standing in the gap for my
[1:37:56] people Brother D stood in the gap for
[1:37:59] the
[1:38:00] people so we are the weaker vessel Satan
[1:38:04] can get to us quicker than he can get
[1:38:08] to
[1:38:09] sorry the wife being the weaker V vessel
[1:38:13] only gives a smaller light in the
[1:38:14] absence of her husband and the church
[1:38:17] can only make manifestations of the Holy
[1:38:19] Spirit and remember the Moon cannot give
[1:38:22] light of her
[1:38:23] own so see Eve didn't have her own light
[1:38:26] she her light came from
[1:38:28] Adam amen Satan knew that though he knew
[1:38:33] she was a weaker vessel he could watch
[1:38:35] her be the not not the mother of her own
[1:38:38] children but she was mothering maybe the
[1:38:41] animals hey mother's a
[1:38:44] mother she would be motherly she would
[1:38:46] she would you know be the one that would
[1:38:49] oh this is so neat Adam's like
[1:38:51] it's okay honey I got business to take
[1:38:53] care of you know in other words I got to
[1:38:55] move mountains and all this other stuff
[1:38:57] but now before that sure they were co-
[1:39:00] equal right but Satan knew though if he
[1:39:04] could ever get them
[1:39:06] apart he didn't dare talk to Eve while
[1:39:09] Adam was
[1:39:11] there God don't sorry Satan don't dare
[1:39:14] bother you while brother Dale's
[1:39:19] preaching it's when you go home
[1:39:21] home during the week it's when he plays
[1:39:25] with you is that right amen stay under
[1:39:29] your headship what brother Brown
[1:39:32] said it's not the Moonlight it's a
[1:39:35] reflection of the sunlight so she was a
[1:39:38] reflection Adam she was a reflection of
[1:39:40] Adam but she wasn't
[1:39:43] Adam she was an
[1:39:45] individual taken apart because listen
[1:39:48] that whole type had to go Moon Sun
[1:39:52] Adam
[1:39:53] Eve Christ bride it's got to all be in
[1:39:57] continuity so God knew he had to start
[1:39:59] it listen God starts it right right so
[1:40:03] he's definitely going to end it
[1:40:05] right everybody with me Jehovah gy
[1:40:14] 1956 oh okay he's talking about Isaac it
[1:40:19] was on Sunday afternoon when he spoke to
[1:40:20] him maybe on Monday morning how's he
[1:40:22] going to do poor little Isaac he looks
[1:40:25] at him oh he loves him but I can't look
[1:40:27] at that I got to think of obeying of
[1:40:29] obeying of God so he couldn't tell
[1:40:32] Sarah what's he talking about what I
[1:40:35] just talk Abraham taking Isaac listen
[1:40:38] God didn't come to to Sarah and say
[1:40:41] Sarah your husband's going to take that
[1:40:43] boy up on the mountain and they're going
[1:40:44] to kill him God knew what she would do
[1:40:47] she'd pitch a
[1:40:49] fit right cuz the emotion That's my
[1:40:54] boy he couldn't do that God told the
[1:40:58] preacher
[1:41:00] first CU being Ley wouldn't mess it up
[1:41:03] if we got it first I'm
[1:41:07] sorry but I can't look at that I got to
[1:41:09] think of obeying God so he couldn't tell
[1:41:12] Sarah cuz you know the ladies are the
[1:41:14] weaker vessel so you sometimes you have
[1:41:17] to watch see I can't tell Sarah cuz she
[1:41:20] wouldn't
[1:41:21] understand Sarah never was too strong
[1:41:24] anyway in
[1:41:26] faith cuz she lacked she dis believe the
[1:41:29] promise but Abraham held her because the
[1:41:33] man and the woman are one the woman
[1:41:37] could not be saved in the Old Testament
[1:41:39] only by the
[1:41:41] man because it was circumcision and she
[1:41:44] had to be joined to her husband in order
[1:41:46] to receive it but in the last days God's
[1:41:48] poured out his Spirit circumcised all of
[1:41:50] our hearts male and female all right
[1:41:53] sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to
[1:41:54] Daniel you women I've holled at you now
[1:41:57] I'm going to take up for you a minute
[1:41:59] see the woman is a weaker vessel I know
[1:42:02] there can't be a bad man before there's
[1:42:05] a bad woman but men who knows that men
[1:42:09] who knows that you're are a son of God
[1:42:10] and take advantage of a woman shame on
[1:42:14] you dating let's go back to what we're
[1:42:16] talking about dating shame on you if you
[1:42:18] take advantage of a woman she's going to
[1:42:19] be the weaker vessel
[1:42:21] she's going to fall for you A lot of
[1:42:23] times more than come on somebody she's
[1:42:25] going to fall for you a lot more than he
[1:42:27] falls for
[1:42:30] her because of what weaker
[1:42:34] vessel everybody
[1:42:36] okay the woman is a weaker vessel I know
[1:42:38] there can't be a bad man before there's
[1:42:40] not a bad woman but men who know that
[1:42:43] men who know that you're a Son of God
[1:42:44] and take advantage of a woman shame on
[1:42:47] you no matter what she does she's a
[1:42:50] weaker vessel and you know
[1:42:52] that if she goes to acting unlady like
[1:42:55] take her by the hand and talk to her
[1:42:57] like a sister you're a Son of God don't
[1:43:00] do them evil things look at Joseph he
[1:43:02] was an example of you remember what
[1:43:04] happened to Joseph he got caught in
[1:43:07] Piper's wife's house and she wanted him
[1:43:10] and he don't want have nothing to do
[1:43:11] with her so he run out and left and then
[1:43:13] she told on him or told her version of
[1:43:17] it now it's taking something to redeem
[1:43:19] this Fallen woman which was typified in
[1:43:21] Eve when she fell Adam was not deceived
[1:43:26] you got to remember we preach this and
[1:43:28] preach it preach it it wasn't 's
[1:43:31] fault for the
[1:43:35] fall it was Adam's
[1:43:37] fault he was deceived she was deceived
[1:43:41] he wasn't she didn't know what she
[1:43:44] didn't know she was doing wrong cuz she
[1:43:46] was the weaker vessel but Adam went in
[1:43:48] brother R said with both eyes wide open
[1:43:52] knowing if he took Eve it would destroy
[1:43:55] the whole world now I know brother R
[1:43:57] says Eve caused all this yeah she got
[1:43:59] the ball rolling but still Adam sold us
[1:44:02] out yeah not
[1:44:05] Eve Adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:44:07] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:44:09] Adam knowed what he was doing wrong she
[1:44:12] didn't I'm not hurting your feelings but
[1:44:14] you know I've always stood for it I
[1:44:16] don't agree with women ministers cuz
[1:44:18] it's not supposed to be that way it's
[1:44:19] why a woman's not supposed to have
[1:44:20] anything do with the church sorry I'm
[1:44:21] hurting your feelings you talk to
[1:44:23] brother Brown about it she is the weaker
[1:44:26] vessel now we find that this woman was
[1:44:29] deceived by someone quoting her the
[1:44:34] word not all of
[1:44:36] it quoting her the word look and just
[1:44:39] missed it a little bit and that's what
[1:44:42] caused all the trouble Paul says let a
[1:44:45] woman keep silent in church do not
[1:44:47] permit to speak and so forth now notice
[1:44:49] 1 Peter 3: seven watch likewise ye
[1:44:52] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:44:54] knowledge giving honor unto your
[1:44:57] wife right as un the weaker vessel and
[1:45:01] as being HS together of the grace of
[1:45:04] life that your prayers be not
[1:45:07] hindered everybody with
[1:45:09] me let me read a couple more right here
[1:45:12] look fellowship with God through
[1:45:14] reconciliation 1956 I'm going be a
[1:45:17] little long but I'm sorry I'm going to
[1:45:18] answer all these questions now Adam was
[1:45:20] not deceived no sir Adam was not
[1:45:22] deceived Adam know exactly what he was
[1:45:24] doing but Eve was deceived and Adam did
[1:45:28] not go out because he had transgressed
[1:45:30] he had not he didn't sin his sin was he
[1:45:34] took on hers Christ didn't sin amen he
[1:45:38] took all mine and yours being the weaker
[1:45:41] vessel he knew we couldn't live without
[1:45:43] him he knew we couldn't what survive
[1:45:46] without
[1:45:48] God he didn't go out
[1:45:51] he wasn't deceived he didn't go out
[1:45:53] because he's being deceived he went out
[1:45:54] because he loved his wife so much he
[1:45:59] went with
[1:46:00] her a beautiful type of Jesus Christ
[1:46:03] knowing no sin but went to hell and took
[1:46:06] our place to redeem his wife
[1:46:09] Hallelujah don't get mistaken in that
[1:46:11] now mixed up see Adam was not deceived
[1:46:14] timothy3 he was not deceived but Eve
[1:46:16] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:46:19] Adam went with her
[1:46:21] to be with her and Christ came down from
[1:46:24] heaven The Immortal God and was made
[1:46:27] flesh and dwelt among us to be one of us
[1:46:29] to die as a sinner at Calvary to redeem
[1:46:32] us back to fellowship with God again a
[1:46:34] beautiful story he didn't have to do
[1:46:37] it but he did it because of his love for
[1:46:41] the church and lost
[1:46:44] Humanity wow looking at the Unseen 1959
[1:46:48] when God made man he made him thus for
[1:46:50] made this little certain and compartment
[1:46:51] in the man for his own Throne his
[1:46:53] control tower heart God wants to lead
[1:46:57] man but man wants to lead
[1:47:01] himself therefore there is a war
[1:47:03] constantly it's what we're talking about
[1:47:04] this morning greatest battle ever fought
[1:47:06] the man wants to go after what he sees
[1:47:08] with his eyes
[1:47:10] look that's where he's deceived that's
[1:47:14] where Satan deceived it now when he
[1:47:15] talks about man he's talking about us
[1:47:16] being the bride when he says he he's
[1:47:19] talking about us being the bride was
[1:47:21] watch that's where he's deceived that's
[1:47:23] where Satan deceived Eve by what she
[1:47:26] could
[1:47:29] see the Bible says the fruit was
[1:47:32] pleasant to her
[1:47:34] eye feelings
[1:47:37] emotion
[1:47:40] sisters understand what this what he's
[1:47:42] saying you're just an emotional bunch of
[1:47:46] nerves
[1:47:47] right get nervous about every little
[1:47:50] thing
[1:47:53] sorry and sometimes we make we as the
[1:47:57] Bride of Jesus Christ make rash
[1:47:58] decisions or false
[1:48:00] decisions oh wait a minute perfect ones
[1:48:02] raise our
[1:48:04] hand thank you that was where Satan
[1:48:07] deceived Eve by what she could see the
[1:48:10] fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was
[1:48:12] death to the
[1:48:14] soul now we know brother Brown talks
[1:48:16] about Soul and Spirit intertwin I mean
[1:48:18] interchangeable she wasn't dead in her
[1:48:21] soul her soul by the Genesis 1 126 man
[1:48:26] was eternal everybody with me on that
[1:48:28] okay the theophany when he pulled the
[1:48:30] theophany apart if Adam was eternal in
[1:48:32] Soul so was Eve she fell in her memory
[1:48:36] reason conscious affe
[1:48:38] imagination right so it is tonight God
[1:48:41] wants to lead man so he made himself a
[1:48:43] little control tower in the midst of his
[1:48:45] heart so that man would be led by the
[1:48:47] spirit of God getting off on his own
[1:48:50] leading is what separated him from his
[1:48:52] Fellowship getting Eve separated from
[1:48:55] Adam is what what Satan used remember
[1:48:59] he's a divider
[1:49:01] amen get you as far away from God as he
[1:49:03] can and then he'll try to deal with
[1:49:06] you so that man would be led by the
[1:49:08] spirit of God getting off on your own is
[1:49:10] what separated you from his
[1:49:12] Fellowship looking at what you can see
[1:49:14] with your own
[1:49:17] eyes the scripture says Sons and
[1:49:19] Daughters though are led by the spirit
[1:49:21] of God your emotions is your control and
[1:49:24] you can notice a man or a woman that
[1:49:26] tries to walk after the things of the
[1:49:27] world they never can please God but a
[1:49:30] man or woman that will not look at the
[1:49:32] things of the world but just go
[1:49:33] according to the leading of the Holy
[1:49:35] Spirit they're usually in the will of
[1:49:37] God that is the great fight tonight
[1:49:40] Satan took the eye a man's head to
[1:49:43] control him and God took his heart CU
[1:49:46] there's no eye in the heart eyes are up
[1:49:49] here this is
[1:49:51] Faith so the reason she fell is is
[1:49:54] because she was the weaker vessel she
[1:49:56] got the emotional part of Adam everybody
[1:50:00] with me she got
[1:50:04] Adam separated here's Eve that doesn't
[1:50:07] make her when I do this that doesn't
[1:50:08] make her the reason she's down here now
[1:50:10] is because what the fall the Covenant
[1:50:13] Covenant was they were both equal if
[1:50:14] they both eat the tree they're both
[1:50:16] going to die all right they both died
[1:50:18] but then you went into another where
[1:50:20] what she's now the weaker vessel very
[1:50:22] weak
[1:50:23] vessel childbearing we read all that I
[1:50:26] don't have to read it everybody okay was
[1:50:28] that
[1:50:29] good she was a weaker
[1:50:31] vessel he couldn't fall because he was
[1:50:34] what the closest thing to God she was
[1:50:36] the byproduct that came
[1:50:38] out the problem was I like what brother
[1:50:42] J for said one time the problem was when
[1:50:44] Adam when Eve come out of
[1:50:46] Adam God sewed
[1:50:49] up the
[1:50:51] slipped right remember it says he closed
[1:50:53] it up so Eve couldn't get back into Adam
[1:50:57] but when
[1:50:58] Christ the second Adam when he went to
[1:51:01] the cross and he got slit in aside it's
[1:51:05] still open for an eternity we can get
[1:51:07] back into the side of Adam amen that's
[1:51:11] exactly why that that side Thomas put
[1:51:15] your hand in here cuz that's where
[1:51:17] you're going back
[1:51:18] to this is a reason you can get back is
[1:51:22] because what the second Adam couldn't
[1:51:24] fall all right every be all right that's
[1:51:27] just the last one do we fall in love
[1:51:30] with Jesus like fall in love with
[1:51:32] getting married amen you ain't a kidding
[1:51:36] let me read this real quick and then
[1:51:38] we'll close we won't have any uh
[1:51:40] musicians or anything if you have any
[1:51:42] other questions though if this created
[1:51:44] questions then please ask them and we'll
[1:51:47] try to answer them next Sunday all right
[1:51:49] listen this is God perfecting his church
[1:51:52] 1954 now

[1:51:56] brandham now she'd say dear Billy I love

[1:54:31] that letter they wouldn't think much
[1:54:32] about it but I do because she loves me
[1:54:37] and I love her it's a love affair and
[1:54:39] when we're born again of
[1:54:41] God it becomes more than just a
[1:54:45] story It's A Love Affair between the
[1:54:48] believer and
[1:54:51] god
[1:54:52] wow he said reveal to babes such it will
[1:54:55] learn God's covenant with Abraham
[1:54:58] 1956 when you love him you love to do
[1:55:02] something for him to bring in souls to
[1:55:05] him it isn't a duty It's A Love
[1:55:09] Affair I I don't I don't love Jim
[1:55:12] because it's a duty oh Lord she's my
[1:55:14] wife so I got to love her you better you
[1:55:16] better yeah you better rethink that
[1:55:20] problem it's a love affair amen oh I
[1:55:24] hope that goes way down look I hope that
[1:55:27] goes way down to the fifth rib on the
[1:55:29] left
[1:55:31] side and anchors there and
[1:55:34] stays It's A Love Affair you love to do
[1:55:37] it 1956 oh this is a continuation I'm
[1:55:40] sorry paragraph e26 if you love your
[1:55:43] wife you love to do something for her
[1:55:46] now that kind of love you can't have
[1:55:47] that same kind of love for Jesus as the
[1:55:50] Greek word put one is fio and one's
[1:55:52] agapy in other words you understand what
[1:55:54] I mean fio love is love for your wife
[1:55:56] agapy love is a word is a love for God
[1:55:58] all right now filio love and agape love
[1:56:01] as we've said is two different things
[1:56:03] but when you divinely love Christ like
[1:56:06] you love your wife only it'll be greater
[1:56:10] higher level than this is down here oh
[1:56:13] don't worry you'll be about the father's
[1:56:15] business trying to win souls and praying
[1:56:16] for the sick and do everything you can
[1:56:18] because you love him you want to please
[1:56:22] him now that's the way it is with God
[1:56:24] not because you know so much but because
[1:56:27] you love him and he loves you sit down
[1:56:29] and read his love letter and he will
[1:56:31] just speak to you right between the
[1:56:33] letters the real content is the text and

[1:59:13] of the Lamb
[1:59:15] 1962 and after the decision and
[1:59:17] made well let go and this is the same
[1:59:20] way it is by making a decision for
[1:59:21] Christ first thing you have to do is
[1:59:23] make up your mind whether you're going
[1:59:25] to serve God and take him as your
[1:59:27] savior same way with the talking about
[1:59:29] going into the courtship the dating
[1:59:31] courtship all
[1:59:32] right and you're not make up your mind
[1:59:35] whether you're going to serve God and
[1:59:36] take him as your savior or you're not
[1:59:38] going to do it are you going to serve
[1:59:41] the world are you going to serve Christ
[1:59:43] you have to make up your mind there has
[1:59:46] to be a decision made when you make up
[1:59:49] up your mind that you're either going to
[1:59:51] serve God or Mammon then you take your
[1:59:54] choice but the decision has to be made
[1:59:58] amen I said before God's going to make
[2:00:01] you make a
[2:00:03] decision you cannot be wishy-washy or on
[2:00:06] the fence remember who owns the fence
[2:00:08] the devil all right look and then after
[2:00:13] the decision is made that you are then
[2:00:17] comes the engagement the that you find
[2:00:20] that at the altar you've got to make an
[2:00:21] engagement before a union can
[2:00:24] be everybody with me and that's the way
[2:00:28] it is with Christ Church it has to be an
[2:00:30] engagement with Christ a pledge an
[2:00:32] engagement A Love Affair amen and then
[2:00:35] the next thing is what promises
[2:00:38] made God's making all the
[2:00:43] promises sweetheart if you marry me I'll
[2:00:47] promise I'll be loyal and true
[2:00:50] I will look upon no other woman or I'll
