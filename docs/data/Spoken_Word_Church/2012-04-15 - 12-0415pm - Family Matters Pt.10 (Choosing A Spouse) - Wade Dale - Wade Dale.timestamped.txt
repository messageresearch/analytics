[14:42] courtship

[14:55] never forget that's right amen you'll
[14:58] never forget the courtship Dave same way
[15:01] with the Lord growing up with the Lord
[15:03] you'll never ever forget the courtship
[15:05] time right never forget that time that
[15:09] the Lord spoke to your heart and
[15:12] you've got to know him real well and
[15:15] then you come to reside in your heart
[15:16] and do him even better
[15:20] everybody
[15:22] remembers that part of their life
[15:24] some of the things that we remember in
[15:26] our marriage we don't want to remember
[15:28] but the courtship part that's the part I
[15:31] love
[15:32] well here we go in Ephesians 5
[15:34] verse 28-31 by way of announcement just
[15:38] remember again the ones out in Kansas
[15:40] they're all okay
[15:43] um everything's fine with them after the
[15:46] second service today we'll have brother
[15:47] Dale a birthday party downstairs we have
[15:49] cake and ice cream no party favor

[15:58] 72nd birthday so we thank God that large
[16:02] gave him 72 good strong
[16:08] looking out with all of us is enough
[16:10] amen
[16:14] okay all right I'll remember all the
[16:17] other announcements June 14 15 16th
[16:19] though really remember that Father's Day
[16:21] camping trip will be getting all the
[16:23] specifics together
[16:25] and be telling you
[16:27] weren't exactly to bring or when to come
[16:30] but we sure would like for everybody
[16:32] last year we had about 25 adults and
[16:35] kids
[16:37] um males and this year we're looking
[16:39] forward to having some more because it's
[16:41] grown every year even if you don't fish
[16:43] they come up and just sit around brother
[16:45] Tony came up there last year and sat
[16:47] around and had fun
[16:49] you know we all even if you don't fish
[16:51] you can always sit around the campfire
[16:52] we have marshmallows and sure do have a
[16:54] lot to eat on Friday night we'll take
[16:56] all of our fish and and uh
[16:59] and put them on the on the fryer and fry
[17:02] some fish and have some hush puppies and
[17:03] some and some slaws so yeah it's uh it's
[17:07] just a good time to Fellowship good time
[17:08] to get away good time to do like what
[17:11] we've been talking about this morning be
[17:13] together as a family because that's what
[17:15] we enjoy to do so and also remember
[17:19] um some were talking downstairs
[17:21] um between Services about the Financial
[17:24] Peace University course
[17:27] um starting in July the 15th uh if you
[17:29] have anybody that wants to come you can
[17:31] bring somebody but I really need to know
[17:35] starting today and and on
[17:38] for a few more months
[17:40] who wants to take it because we got to
[17:43] order the kits for it and the kits are
[17:46] cheaper now
[17:47] so we get a discount on them for buying
[17:49] them through the church anyway but we
[17:51] get a real big discount actually today
[17:53] is the last day for ordering with free
[17:56] shipping but we can get through some of
[17:58] that I call the director at the uh
[18:02] at the uh at Dave Ramsey's office there
[18:05] and ask him talk to him about it he said
[18:07] he would work out something for us so
[18:10] um everybody's having fun in the class
[18:12] and
[18:13] and everybody's
[18:15] got a plan now right right assistant
[18:18] Canard we have a plan we have a budget
[18:22] we have a place to put our money
[18:28] and being a Christian is not bad having
[18:30] money it's just a love of money it's the
[18:32] root of all evil not having money okay
[18:34] you gotta have money to do uh to have
[18:38] your economy and you gotta have money
[18:39] God takes a little bit of it to run his
[18:42] economy with he just asked you to take
[18:44] care of your 90 like he takes care of
[18:46] his team that's right so that's what it
[18:48] is it's all his he just gives you 90
[18:50] back and he but he can do more with 10
[18:52] than we can do with 90. so there's
[18:55] something there must be something in
[18:56] there that we can do different that'll
[18:58] help us to to
[19:00] make our 90 become a member of Jesus
[19:02] told the man he said here take this
[19:04] money and invest it he got on to the one
[19:06] that didn't invest it right remember the
[19:08] guy that buried it in the ground he got
[19:09] on to that guy
[19:11] did you put your money in the ground
[19:12] right okay
[19:16] if he'll ever let me in his yard with
[19:18] that with my
[19:20] Dole finder and a metal detector I'll
[19:23] see what I can find back there
[19:26] Ephesians five all right let's bow our
[19:28] heads but really if you want to do that
[19:30] it'll be after service
[19:32] probably from like five to seven
[19:34] right after church I don't want to
[19:36] interrupt church at all but most of
[19:38] y'all hang around here till 5 30 anyway
[19:40] so we could start right after church is
[19:42] over
[19:43] probably starting July about July the
[19:45] 15th
[19:47] and also be thinking about going to
[19:50] uh Wichita
[19:52] in the month of May which is Memorial
[19:55] Day weekend we're gonna try to leave
[19:58] maybe Thursday night out that'll be our
[19:59] last class for the Dave Randy class
[20:01] that'll be the last one we'll probably
[20:02] try to leave that evening
[20:15] the next Sunday so we'll be there for a
[20:18] little bit of time just keep us in your
[20:20] prayers
[20:20] kind of like we got a plan you know we
[20:22] planned out the year so we know what's
[20:25] going on it's Ephesians five
[20:27] dear heavenly father we pray Lord that
[20:29] what we say Lord will be pleasing to you
[20:32] we pray Lord that you will not be
[20:34] one Lord that stands aside but be the
[20:37] active participant in the service
[20:39] take these lips with Clay Lord and speak
[20:42] to the people you've already give us a
[20:44] thought to to speak on but Lord may you
[20:46] take that thought and Quicken it to the
[20:48] hearts and lives of the people
[20:49] Lord we pray that you just be with us
[20:51] now take care of us lead us and guide us
[20:53] by your truth Lord if it's not word
[20:56] based father we don't want it we want it
[20:58] to be word based and you gave us a
[21:01] prophet as we say read between the lines
[21:04] of this love letter that you sent Lauren
[21:06] it you give us the opportunity to live
[21:08] down here in human flesh and to reflect
[21:10] you and Lord we pray that that's what
[21:12] we'll do as we'll reflect you Lord and
[21:14] as we're speaking today about choosing a
[21:17] bride may we also in our inner being may
[21:20] we realize that that you once chose a
[21:24] bride and look for a certain character
[21:26] in the spiritual sense
[21:28] and Lord I pray that we'll fit that mold
[21:31] pray that we'll put on the garments that
[21:33] you want Lord to be pleasing to you
[21:35] father but even Lord as we're here in
[21:38] the natural Lord
[21:39] the choosing of a bride in the natural
[21:41] Lord is a very important thing
[21:44] we pray now that as we speak Lord we
[21:46] know that a lot of us have already
[21:47] walked down that that pathway and and
[21:50] already have the spouse Lord that that
[21:52] you gave us but father they summoned the
[21:54] building that doesn't have a spouse
[21:56] Warren and we we truly want them to have
[21:59] and I'm honestly from My Heart Lord I
[22:01] want them to have uh just a full rich
[22:04] Christian Life with their spouse I want
[22:07] to be close Lord and not have not have
[22:10] the problems that this world sees of
[22:12] divorce and and all this running around
[22:15] and junk that they do here Lord that's
[22:18] the world but father you gave us a Bible
[22:20] you gave us the Holy Spirit you gave us
[22:23] minister of Lord that that can take the
[22:25] word and deliver it to the people as you
[22:27] want it to be delivered that they will
[22:29] understand it and know how to live Lord
[22:31] that they'll have Holy Ghost knowledge
[22:33] when they make their choices Lawrence
[22:35] just bless us now and take care of us
[22:37] forgive us of our sins thank you for
[22:38] blessing the ones out in Oklahoma and
[22:40] Kansas Lord that are out there in the
[22:42] paths of those tornadoes that you moved
[22:44] to out of the landlord afraid that you
[22:46] just bless us now and take care of us in
[22:47] the furthermore this service Jesus name
[22:49] we pray amen
[22:52] Ephesians 5
[22:53] 28-31 so like men to love their wives as
[22:57] their own bodies now we're backing up a
[22:59] little bit but just continue the thought
[23:00] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[23:04] for no man I ever hated his own flesh
[23:07] but nourishes it and cherishes it now
[23:09] we're looking for a spouse all right
[23:10] we're choosing a spouse this afternoon
[23:12] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[23:15] but nourish you and cherishes ongoing
[23:19] t-h right even as the Lord the church
[23:22] because he does the same thing with us
[23:24] right he nourishes us and cherishes for
[23:26] we are members of his body of his
[23:28] fleshing of his bones for this cause
[23:30] shall a man leave his father and mother
[23:33] shall be joined into his wife and they
[23:35] too shall be one flesh now let's go to
[23:38] Matthew 19.
[23:41] and he answered and said unto them
[23:43] have you not read that he which made
[23:46] them at the beginning made them male and
[23:48] female
[23:51] one in one one male one female right
[23:53] right and said for this cause shall man
[23:56] leave his father and mother shall cleave
[23:58] to his wife that doesn't say leave your
[24:01] wife and clean for your mother and
[24:03] father all right all right
[24:06] and for this call shall a man leave
[24:08] father and mother and shall cleave to
[24:10] his wife and they twain shall be one
[24:12] flesh
[24:13] wherefore they are no more Twain but one
[24:16] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[24:19] together let no man put us under you may
[24:23] be seated in the Lord has blessing to
[24:24] the reading of the word
[24:26] we come to a time that tonight we want
[24:28] to to dwell a little bit on
[24:31] choosing a spouse and the things that we
[24:33] do and the planning because outside of
[24:36] your salvation this is probably the most
[24:38] important decision you'll ever make in
[24:40] your life amen because no other decision
[24:43] in your life outside of Salvation is
[24:45] from Death do you part right
[24:48] there you know you can join to a friend
[24:51] or you can join to an acquaintance and
[24:52] you can you can hunt and fish with them
[24:55] for 20 years but somewhere down the line
[24:59] your part
[25:00] somewhere down the line they'll get
[25:02] married you'll get married or somewhere
[25:04] down the line this will happen and this
[25:05] will happen so I'm going to move because
[25:06] of a job somebody will do this somebody
[25:08] will do that but when you choose your
[25:11] spouse it is for
[25:14] Eternal tea
[25:16] it is till death do you part here and we
[25:19] read this morning where even into the
[25:21] eternities the husband and wife the
[25:24] family unit will still be there in
[25:26] eternity right all right so now look
[25:28] it's an important decision it's not
[25:30] something that you need to take lightly
[25:31] and I know we got some young people in
[25:33] here
[25:34] need to
[25:37] think about this
[25:42] that door's not looking it's anything
[25:44] that brother Tim
[25:47] cook number one
[25:54] all right let's get started listen to
[25:56] this
[25:58] what's your brother Brandon brings this
[26:00] out
[26:01] now there's
[26:04] three things we're going to look at this
[26:05] afternoon probably just two of them
[26:06] we're not gonna We're not gonna run too
[26:09] lengthy this afternoon we'll probably
[26:11] finish up next Sunday
[26:13] with two Services next Sunday and we'll
[26:16] we'll be finished
[26:25] either not
[26:26] in the decision that you and your
[26:28] girlfriend has to make whether you're
[26:30] going to live together or get married or
[26:31] not there's all kinds of decisions to be
[26:34] made in life and they'll linger along
[26:36] for a certain period and then a time
[26:38] comes where it's got to be settled
[26:40] that's the last time it's got to happen
[26:42] now one way or the other all right
[26:45] number two
[26:46] choosing of a brat read that book that
[26:48] book we're going to use a lot of quotes
[26:49] in today brother Brown really covers the
[26:52] natural and the spiritual part of
[26:53] choosing them right there's another
[26:55] choice that we have in life that's a
[26:57] life's companion
[26:59] a young man or a young woman stepping
[27:01] out on life has been given a right to
[27:03] make a choice
[27:04] the young man chooses the young woman
[27:07] has a right to accept or reject it
[27:09] I didn't say the young woman asked the
[27:11] young man
[27:13] yeah
[27:15] it's the young man asks the young woman
[27:18] right
[27:19] right so young men here we are at the
[27:22] role again of headship
[27:24] you're the one that's got to make the
[27:26] choice first
[27:29] then you ask her and she has the ability
[27:33] to say yes or no that's like Dan said
[27:36] the other night if she says young ladies
[27:38] if you don't think that's the right guy
[27:40] all you gotta do is say no
[27:42] or not right now
[27:44] or you're not the one
[27:47] that's all you got to say and that's it
[27:49] that doesn't constitute that you're
[27:50] married to the person I don't care if he
[27:52] camps out on your doorstep throws rocks
[27:54] through your window climbs up in your
[27:57] you know tries to climb up in your room
[27:58] I don't care
[27:59] if you say no man that means no right
[28:04] all right
[28:05] no means no and I'm not looking in the
[28:07] camera cambo's behind the camera all
[28:09] right brother Tim was going to be he's
[28:12] setting the highest today he's
[28:15] he's going to fall asleep
[28:18] or he's fainted I think that's probably
[28:21] what it is but the young man chooses the
[28:24] young woman has a right to accept or
[28:26] reject it now we've got young sisters in
[28:27] here too
[28:29] but it's still a choice on both sides
[28:32] but the male has to initiate
[28:34] both man and woman they have a right to
[28:36] Choice also you have a choice as a
[28:39] Christian all right number three
[28:42] in choosing a variety again but you know
[28:44] you have to plan watch this these are
[28:47] the three things we're going to look at
[28:48] today plan
[28:50] look and pray
[28:54] plan
[28:56] look Pray when you're choosing when we
[29:00] see by this the Word of Promise she's a
[29:03] bride that a man would choose is going
[29:04] to reflect his character
[29:09] it reflects what's in him
[29:12] now could you imagine a man feel with
[29:14] the Holy Ghost takes something like that
[29:16] to be a wife now what he's doing is he's
[29:18] talking about Ahab and Jezebel yeah
[29:20] congregation says no I just don't see it
[29:23] brother now maybe I'm just an old crank
[29:25] but you know I just can't understand
[29:27] that see notice where it's going to
[29:29] reflect what's in him she is going to
[29:31] help him make his future home amen amen
[29:35] all right so this is the choice the man
[29:38] has got to do these three things first
[29:41] then you sisters you have to do the same
[29:44] thing
[29:44] there's not a problem I you know you can
[29:47] say what you want to do about me but I
[29:50] do things and I break things down and
[29:53] and I try to do things in life with a
[29:55] plan
[29:56] I said I'll try there's a lot of some
[29:58] things that you have to do kind of
[30:00] spontaneously but there's some things
[30:01] that you can't help but if you'll make a
[30:04] plan like I said this morning
[30:06] about planning
[30:08] if you don't have a plan then your plan
[30:11] is going to always fail
[30:14] don't have a plan Brothers sit down and
[30:17] say look I want to be able to support
[30:19] like bro Tim said yesterday we were
[30:22] talking about it or maybe it was a few
[30:24] days ago he said I'm not financially
[30:26] stable enough yet that's good that's the
[30:28] planer he's honest with that so that
[30:30] that he said hey I am not financially
[30:33] able to have a spouse at this time right
[30:36] now unless I want her to work too
[30:39] yeah that's the same way you got to do
[30:40] your Sisters You Brought young Brothers
[30:42] you got to look at it and say hey if I'm
[30:45] gonna plan to be the only breadwinner
[30:48] I gotta make x amount of dollars to
[30:50] support me and my family
[30:52] right you know like brother Ryan does
[30:54] that brother Ryan he he works and sister
[30:56] Gabby done that's wonderful made a plan
[30:59] for that yeah
[31:01] plan worked at least he made a plan
[31:04] instead of going into this thing just
[31:05] you know just oh you know loves blind
[31:09] like the guy said one time love is blind
[31:11] but it don't have to be deaf and dumb
[31:16] I like that Love's blind but doesn't
[31:19] have to be deaf and dumb
[31:21] and that's correct Love is Blind
[31:24] but you still gotta look and see what
[31:25] you're getting into plan look and pray
[31:28] when you're choosing but we see by this
[31:30] a Word of Promise be the bride that a
[31:33] man would choose is going to reflect his
[31:34] character see that's another thing we'll
[31:35] get into and maybe maybe next Sunday but
[31:39] she's going to reflect his character
[31:42] if she doesn't they're no two they're
[31:43] not 20. they compliment remember I
[31:46] talked about the complimenting the
[31:47] sister the the wife compliments the
[31:50] husband right all right very
[31:52] complimentary or accessorized all right
[31:54] planning looking and praying let's start
[31:56] right here
[31:57] this is not just a sometime or
[31:59] convenient decision
[32:01] a lot of times we see that it's a
[32:03] convenient decision we're going to get
[32:04] married we're just going to leave
[32:06] because we I don't want to be at home I
[32:08] don't want to feel left out
[32:10] have a plan
[32:12] sisters if you're going to go to school
[32:13] say all right I got four years plan
[32:16] Brothers okay I'm gonna go to school I'm
[32:18] gonna get a good job there's four years
[32:19] I'm not going to play around
[32:22] we'll read it in just a little while
[32:23] brother Brown said don't play around
[32:25] right
[32:26] don't play around with just dating
[32:28] anybody and just accepting anything that
[32:31] comes along no have a plan right
[32:35] now I know a lot of Us wish we had had
[32:37] this teaching before we started
[32:56] so that's the way it was going to be
[32:58] anyway brother I'm sorry it's burden we
[33:01] have to wait
[33:03] but some sometimes look how many times
[33:07] have you seen this though
[33:10] convenience get married or date out of
[33:13] convenience no if you're going to take
[33:15] four years of school Forget About a Boy
[33:16] for it for four years you okay you're
[33:19] young
[33:20] you're not losing out on anything
[33:24] right you know
[33:25] I hate that word play the field there's
[33:27] no PL and then if you're a Christian and
[33:31] you are abide by the word of God and we
[33:33] believe the prophet's message because
[33:34] I'm going to keep reading the quotes now
[33:35] through here
[33:37] there's no playing around time
[33:40] no playing around time okay
[33:43] but you need to have a plan right right
[33:45] if you have a plan that'll take care of
[33:47] that playing around stuff then when you
[33:49] get serious and we you plan first then
[33:52] you start looking planning looking and
[33:55] praying not planning looking go planning
[33:59] looking and praying you know that
[34:00] there's nothing about loving that
[34:04] you learn to love remember
[34:07] I'll read your quote in just a minute
[34:09] this is not just a sometime or
[34:11] convenient decision outside of salvation
[34:13] it is the most important decision you'll
[34:15] ever make if you fail to plan your plan
[34:17] will fail every time so young kids you
[34:21] can think we're old foggy or not but let
[34:23] me tell you something it's just like
[34:24] this you need to listen to the older
[34:26] people you've heard the same been there
[34:28] done that got a t-shirt for it we've
[34:32] been there done that had you for it
[34:37] right we've been there done that and
[34:40] you're you're the result of it
[34:43] anything that comes up you think Mom and
[34:45] Dad's old fogy
[34:47] basically everything works exactly the
[34:50] same
[34:51] businesses I don't care what business
[34:53] you're in you got income outgo profit
[34:58] that's it I don't care what kind of
[35:00] business yeah I don't care if you're
[35:01] selling dope
[35:02] same thing you buy it you're selling for
[35:05] a price and you make a profit
[35:07] cause ain't playing with a plan this
[35:08] plan is going to work every time if
[35:10] you'll plan something
[35:12] according to the word of God
[35:14] a plan helps you make a decision and
[35:16] Maps out how you will accomplish it
[35:19] with the resources we have today this is
[35:21] my quote with the resources that we have
[35:23] today as far as the message of the hour
[35:25] the knowledge by the Holy Ghost through
[35:27] parents and the ministry we should be
[35:29] able to make sound decisions about our
[35:30] choices now look we can and will help
[35:33] that's me
[35:35] I'll help you any way I can
[35:37] but parents you're supposed to be the
[35:39] first ones all right but we can and
[35:41] we'll give help
[35:43] all right so let's start with the
[35:45] planning phase what does the word plan
[35:46] mean a method of arranging in advance
[35:51] that's the whole key
[35:54] plan in advance
[35:56] you don't plan during the battle
[35:59] right you improvise during the battle
[36:01] you planned before the battle happens
[36:04] and God's laid to plan out already for
[36:07] us remember it's a Plan of Redemption
[36:09] but we have a plan down here on Earth
[36:11] and we've got goals that we've got to
[36:13] accomplish or that we want to accomplish
[36:15] you say put that in the scripture Paul
[36:18] was a pretty good guy about plans like
[36:20] this
[36:21] Colossians 3 2 set your affection point
[36:24] a plan
[36:25] set your affections on things above not
[36:27] on things in the Earth
[36:29] First Corinthians 9 24. know ye that
[36:32] they which run in a race run all but one
[36:34] receive at the prize so run that you may
[36:37] obtain right make a plan so that you can
[36:39] make it and every man that strives for
[36:42] the Mastery is temperate in all things
[36:48] camper it right every man that strives
[36:52] for the mastery
[36:54] I was talking to brother Bob in the bank
[36:57] we were talking about a certain things
[36:58] and this gets to me
[37:02] easier to to to get in a channel
[37:07] but it's a match it's not a Mastery of
[37:09] the word of God but it's a Mastery to
[37:10] let God take over and sit at home and
[37:13] say God what how do you put this
[37:16] together
[37:17] take these big pieces of puzzle that
[37:20] everybody's got these questions about
[37:21] and bring it together and make a picture
[37:23] out of it that's my job the picture of
[37:26] the puzzle pieces are already there
[37:29] amen the words already there it's just
[37:32] taking somebody to take it and pull it
[37:34] together
[37:35] and be temperate what
[37:38] hold your temper
[37:39] or be temperate in all things
[37:42] now they do it to what obtain a
[37:44] correctable crown right but we do it in
[37:47] an incredible crown
[37:48] I therefore so run not as uncertainly
[37:53] that certainly means you don't have a
[37:56] plan yeah he runs with certainty
[37:59] possible Paul's saying right so fine I
[38:02] not his one that beat at the air
[38:05] right he had a plan
[38:06] Paul had a plan a plan in life
[38:10] let's go to Colossians we got the
[38:12] Colossians 3 and Corinthians let's go to
[38:14] quote number four
[38:16] excuse me of a bride and after spiritual
[38:18] or the natural attack of the spiritual
[38:19] then the choosing of her bride and the
[38:21] natural is the type of choosing a bride
[38:23] be bride in the spiritual now it's a
[38:25] serious thing when we go to choose a
[38:27] wife a man
[38:28] but the vows here is unto death do we
[38:30] part we understand that right if we
[38:33] would have all held to that
[38:37] right yeah things might not have been
[38:40] right as bad as they are
[38:43] but we have grief
[38:46] that God's give us right amen because
[38:49] we're all guilty
[38:50] that's how we should keep it
[38:53] and you take that vow before God that
[38:55] only death will separate you because I
[38:58] mean Daddy and I were talking going down
[38:59] the road the other day I actually
[39:02] in Christianity there's no there's
[39:04] nothing called marriage and divorce
[39:05] right
[39:09] in Christianity there's no divorce right
[39:11] right the Bible don't tell you it's okay
[39:13] to divorce it never has told you you get
[39:15] divorce except because if your wife is
[39:17] unclean
[39:18] the only right it's fornication the only
[39:21] thing that the bible really says you can
[39:23] not marry her or put her ways because
[39:24] she was unclean that's the only thing
[39:26] right
[39:30] so really in true Christianity if you
[39:32] got a born-again a woman and a
[39:35] born-again man
[39:36] that's what God wants amen
[39:38] he puts him two together and they're one
[39:41] right they don't divorce never will
[39:44] divorce right they'll work their
[39:46] problems out but if you'll maybe if we
[39:49] can plan and then look and then pray and
[39:52] then start the dating process like we're
[39:54] going to go through here maybe we can
[39:57] knock out some of that because look
[39:59] that's how we should keep it and you
[40:01] take that bow before God that only death
[40:03] will separate you
[40:04] and I think we shouldn't a man in his
[40:07] right mind that's planning a future
[40:09] put the word planning and planning and
[40:12] see how many times brother Branham talks
[40:13] about playing
[40:15] you think I'm crazy so well you're just
[40:17] being too much like school no we need we
[40:19] need a plan right
[40:24] planning a future that he should choose
[40:27] that wife very carefully be careful what
[40:29] you're doing in a woman choosing a
[40:31] husband or accepting the choice of a
[40:33] husband he corrected himself
[40:35] because she doesn't choose she accepts
[40:38] the choice of a husband should be real
[40:41] careful what she's doing it especially
[40:43] in these days a man should look and pray
[40:45] because you should think and pray before
[40:47] he chooses the wife until right here
[40:49] says I think today we got so many
[40:51] divorce cases now that we lead the world
[40:53] in America in divorce cases
[40:55] how many times I mean I'm not married
[40:57] anybody that's this got a divorce but
[41:00] how many times the the people lie to
[41:02] each other yeah yeah I'm talking to
[41:05] people lie to each other
[41:07] do you take this yes do you take this
[41:09] through death do you part yes I do yes I
[41:11] do six months later than divorced
[41:13] somebody lied yeah somebody told him to
[41:16] lie and that vowel was before who God
[41:18] not the people before God and the people
[41:21] I'm sorry
[41:24] without him as a Christian Nation what a
[41:26] reproach our divorce court
[41:27] I think the reason of it is is because
[41:30] that man has gotten away from God and
[41:32] women have gone away from God and we
[41:34] find out if a man prayed and a woman
[41:36] prayed over the matter now I just look
[41:38] at a pretty set of eyes
[41:40] okay
[41:43] our big strong shoulders
[41:49] are such as that or some other worldly
[41:52] affection but would look first to God
[41:53] and say God is this your what
[41:57] amen plan
[42:00] and if we would study
[42:02] study what we're doing
[42:04] we're going to get married
[42:07] when we choose our wife our husband if
[42:09] you'd study it over
[42:10] a man should pray earnestly for he could
[42:13] ruin his entire life but now what the
[42:16] problem is now is they they figure they
[42:18] don't want to work their problems out so
[42:20] they just this is the book
[42:22] it's just divorce
[42:24] I can't work my problem now let's just
[42:26] divorce it's so easy we can go down
[42:29] like 3.99 they'll give you a toaster you
[42:31] get a divorce
[42:33] I mean it's all over the Billboards
[42:35] remember it's all over the billboard
[42:36] 3.99 uncontested divorce
[42:39] remember the vowel is until death do we
[42:42] part
[42:43] and he could ruin his life by making the
[42:45] wrong choice
[42:46] but if he knows what
[42:49] he making the wrong choice and just
[42:51] marrying a woman that isn't fit to be a
[42:52] wife and he does it anyway then it's the
[42:55] man's fault it's his fault if the woman
[42:58] takes the husband and knows that he's
[43:00] not fit to be a husband to you then
[43:02] that's your own fault right after you
[43:04] know what's right and wrong
[43:06] so you shouldn't do it until you
[43:08] thoroughly
[43:09] pray through
[43:11] all right next one
[43:13] statue of a perfect man
[43:15] I believe that God gives us a mate
[43:17] that's true and we become part of each
[43:19] other that's right and for a man gets
[43:21] married he should think these things
[43:23] over
[43:25] study it right
[43:27] studying
[43:30] next one
[43:31] perseverance when a man takes his wife
[43:34] he's got to base his faith in that woman
[43:39] she's got to base her faith in that man
[43:42] some reason to make the goal of Life
[43:45] goal plan
[43:47] if he doesn't then there's something
[43:49] wrong and it won't work you've got to
[43:52] have faith and what better to have faith
[43:54] in than the word of God all right number
[43:57] seven leadership
[43:59] you have a choice of conduct how you
[44:01] conduct yourself that's up to you you
[44:03] have a choice of life you go out and
[44:05] take your wife you want to take a wife
[44:07] you want to take one that's
[44:08] complementary to your to what you want
[44:11] your plan your future home to be could
[44:13] you imagine a man a Christian man going
[44:15] out and taking one of these modern
[44:16] ricketters for a while huh could you
[44:19] imagine what's the man thinking about
[44:21] what kind of a home is he going to have
[44:24] if he takes a striptease a burlesque off
[44:26] the street out here a street prostitute
[44:28] oh you say now wait a minute how does
[44:30] she dress herself he's asking please see
[44:32] wear shorts and things she's a street
[44:34] prostitute oh you say now brother
[44:36] Brandon I want them little old tight
[44:38] skirt so like you poured into them great
[44:40] prostitute
[44:42] we got to be careful amen
[44:45] our wives wear that and present
[44:47] theirself out and
[44:52] found it
[44:55] you know what that makes me right
[44:58] you purchased you
[45:01] and you are responsible for it right
[45:04] amen sorry the message is out it's the
[45:07] word of God it's something we got to
[45:09] live by
[45:10] all right let's go to number eight
[45:15] before we read this he's talking about
[45:17] this he said I ain't man for a little
[45:18] bitty kids to get married because he his
[45:20] mom and dad got married at 15 and 18 and
[45:24] 15. that's almost when Mom and Daddy got
[45:26] married almost so
[45:28] oh but it says don't amen for little
[45:30] bitty kids to get married now let your
[45:31] father and mother they know
[45:34] they're Christians they can instruct you
[45:37] daughter comes
[45:39] son comes and says I want to get married
[45:43] please at least talk to your mother and
[45:47] father about it
[45:50] um I I love the way they do it in
[45:52] Jamaica
[45:54] if they know that that John's looking at
[45:57] Mary
[45:58] what do they do
[46:01] brother Keith brings John and Mary up in
[46:03] front of the church
[46:04] he says I want the whole church to know
[46:06] that John and Mary are thinking
[46:09] planning looking at each other not
[46:13] dating or anything but they are
[46:16] kind of looking at each other
[46:19] and the whole church
[46:21] it's a whole big set of eyes
[46:24] and them people can't get away from them
[46:26] he got you know 150 people in his church
[46:28] but he brings them before the church and
[46:30] then they pray and then he says you
[46:32] watch them
[46:34] we are to watch over them
[46:37] until they get married
[46:40] will that stop some of this
[46:42] ain't Summer Girls even in a message
[46:45] you'd have to bring them up 14 or 15
[46:46] times
[46:47] that's not good
[46:49] that's not good because when it when
[46:52] John is looking at Mary 99.99 of the
[46:55] time John and Mary get married
[46:58] because they've already that everybody's
[47:00] praying everybody's in the right frame
[47:01] of mind they watch John and Mary and
[47:03] make sure John and Mary doesn't do
[47:04] anything wrong because we know this
[47:06] question getting away sometime
[47:08] been there done that we know that and
[47:10] young people we've all been that way
[47:12] amen that's what I thought
[47:15] I was hoping some of you were still
[47:17] human
[47:19] but talk to your mother and your father
[47:22] if they're Christians especially make an
[47:25] instruction because remember just like I
[47:26] said been there done that we've been
[47:27] through all the things there is no new
[47:30] thing that you kids are going to go
[47:31] through that we haven't been through
[47:32] nothing there's nothing you can say well
[47:35] it's this and it's no it's nothing
[47:38] we've all been through it right all
[47:41] right so now your choice reveals what
[47:43] your real goal is it shows your real
[47:45] plan
[47:46] and your real character let's read this
[47:48] number nine
[47:51] do you think of a brain so you must make
[47:53] the right choice again the kind of woman
[47:55] that a man would choose
[47:57] his ambition
[47:59] and his character
[48:01] right if a man chooses the wrong woman
[48:04] it reflects his character
[48:07] and what he ties himself to
[48:10] shows truly what's in him
[48:13] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[48:15] he chooses her for a wife it shows
[48:18] what's down in him no matter what he
[48:21] says outside watching what he married
[48:24] three times huh
[48:26] and he talks about Boogie Woogie music
[48:28] and said you're Christian got Pinups in
[48:30] your house and all that stuff what say
[48:32] if he would marry a chorus girl and what
[48:34] if we marry a sex queen or just a pretty
[48:35] murder get it it reflects it shows what
[48:39] he has in his mind of what his future
[48:40] home is going to be because he took her
[48:43] to raise his children by
[48:45] like what we're talking about this
[48:46] morning
[48:49] raising children's part of it
[48:51] and whatever she is that's the way
[48:53] she'll raise those children
[48:55] right like I said before
[48:57] the the girl that had a little baby with
[49:00] a cigarette well baby picked the
[49:03] cigarette up because Mom and Daddy smoke
[49:05] right he just done what I mean
[49:08] I hope she didn't whip the kid I'd whip
[49:10] her
[49:12] okay why are you with the kids for
[49:14] something you
[49:16] have done right man you say bad words at
[49:20] home and your kid pops out with a bad
[49:22] word you got it from you all right make
[49:24] the paddle reach back if you can and do
[49:27] it for yourself right all right see it
[49:30] reflects what's in the man a man that
[49:32] takes a woman like that shows just what
[49:34] he's thinking of the future
[49:35] could you imagine a Christian doing a
[49:37] thing like that no sir I could not true
[49:39] Christian will not look for such beauty
[49:42] queens of course girls and sex Queens
[49:44] he'll look for Christian character amen
[49:47] now look
[49:49] he's being honest now you can't have all
[49:52] things
[49:53] there might be one girl that's real
[49:55] pretty
[49:55] another girl maybe she her statue looks
[49:58] better than this one
[49:59] and you might have a sacrifice one for
[50:01] the other
[50:03] but if she's not the stature of a lady
[50:06] of a woman and she I don't care whether
[50:08] she's pretty or not you better look at
[50:10] her character right whether she's pretty
[50:12] or not pretty
[50:13] now for it is becoming if a Christian
[50:16] would choose a wife he ought to choose a
[50:18] genuine Born Again wife
[50:21] like I said this morning not just
[50:22] somebody that says there in the message
[50:23] right
[50:25] oh there's too much gold on around this
[50:27] message that people say they're in the
[50:28] message and I doubt it very seriously
[50:30] but if you're born again there's the
[50:33] difference all right regardless of what
[50:34] she looks like it's what she is what
[50:37] makes her and then again that reflects
[50:39] his own Godly character and reflects
[50:42] what's in his mind and what's going to
[50:44] be in the future how many times have you
[50:45] seen this people maybe somebody just
[50:47] cause the wife's beautiful or or the
[50:50] woman's beautiful and then it never
[50:51] lasts
[50:53] and what's going to be
[51:00] going to be his Queens what could he
[51:02] expect
[51:03] what kind of a home could a man expect
[51:05] to have a female is a girl that ain't
[51:07] got enough morals about her to stay home
[51:08] and take care of the house and wants to
[51:10] work out at somebody's office what kind
[51:12] of a housekeeper will she be you'll have
[51:14] babysitters and everything else true
[51:16] right true because we've all been
[51:18] through that all right so now that was
[51:20] the planning stage
[51:22] plan look
[51:24] guys girls
[51:27] young people
[51:29] write down what you want
[51:31] write down your goals put them on a
[51:34] piece of paper stick them in your bill
[51:35] folder stick them in your purse and say
[51:37] God this is kind of man I'm looking for
[51:39] right here
[51:40] this is kind of man
[51:42] some kind of character some kind of good
[51:44] not any thickly good looking but good
[51:46] character
[51:48] because character will always hold good
[51:50] looks will not always be there I promise
[51:52] all right so now that was the planning
[51:54] stage
[51:55] now let's see here about
[51:58] the looking
[52:00] once you know your goal and you plan it
[52:02] in a way according to the scripture
[52:05] the next step is to look
[52:07] looking through spiritual eyes for
[52:09] things that fulfill your goal so you
[52:11] make your goals first
[52:12] everybody got that okay you make your
[52:14] goals first
[52:16] I hope make your goals first you got a
[52:20] good head on shoulder
[52:22] you'd like your daddy
[52:31] listen when I see two people come
[52:33] together and I'm not talking about hope
[52:34] now when I see two people come together
[52:35] though and you just think and you just
[52:37] sit and you think man it's the eclipse
[52:39] to me that's a beautiful picture because
[52:42] that's what God's looking for he's not
[52:44] looking for you to have an ill attitude
[52:45] he's not looking for you to he's looking
[52:47] for your character that's what he comes
[52:49] to look
[52:51] he loves you because of you he don't
[52:53] love you just because you act like
[52:54] somebody else he loves you because God
[52:56] loves that character you have he stuck
[52:58] something into that
[53:00] genetic
[53:01] strain from this one to this one to this
[53:04] one to this one to this one to this and
[53:05] to get you here
[53:07] looking through spiritual eyes for
[53:09] things that fulfill your goal all right
[53:10] now let's go to
[53:12] questions and answers
[53:15] listen to this
[53:19] I've got to know what I'm doing before I
[53:21] can have faith in what I'm doing
[53:25] right mind you marry your wife
[53:28] you had faith in her
[53:30] you had tried her
[53:34] watched her looking remember we're
[53:37] looking now we're looking
[53:39] can't help but look we're looking
[53:43] you had tried her watched her
[53:47] saying where she come from we'll get
[53:49] into that in a little while he's talking
[53:50] about the family or background who she
[53:52] was that's the way with the scriptures
[53:54] with God same thing all right let's go
[53:57] to number
[53:58] 11.
[54:01] how would you go and pick out you
[54:03] gentlemen young man here young man here
[54:05] young lady here would you walk out on
[54:08] the street and pick up a woman and just
[54:09] marry her just because you walked out
[54:11] and picked her up just because she was a
[54:13] woman in other words
[54:14] I don't have much thoughts of your
[54:16] conception I'm sure but see first you
[54:19] got to know something about her where
[54:22] she comes from her character
[54:25] lashed away with a woman to her husband
[54:27] the same way you must think of those
[54:29] things because it's your lifetime
[54:31] companionship and this is our eighth of
[54:34] eternal life with God right all right we
[54:37] must know what we're looking for what do
[54:39] you need to be looking for a real
[54:41] believer
[54:42] somebody that really don't just believe
[54:45] a message but lives it
[54:47] doesn't just live in front of his
[54:48] parents lives in front of you
[54:51] you can tell
[54:53] you can tell
[54:56] somebody's born again or not just give a
[54:58] few minutes and we can find out
[55:01] all right number 12.
[55:05] look for something that's real
[55:09] and genuine
[55:12] a lot of stuff a lot of put on goes
[55:14] around
[55:15] look for real and genuine that's why you
[55:18] need to look
[55:19] looking through spiritual lives not
[55:21] looking through the lust Veil that we
[55:23] look through a lot we need to be looking
[55:25] through a holy ghost bail all right see
[55:28] if that girl's born again if she isn't
[55:30] saved have nothing to do with her now
[55:33] that's what I'm telling you if you're
[55:35] going to make a plan that in four years
[55:37] you're not going to do anything in four
[55:38] years but go to school girls or guys
[55:41] there's no playing around with
[55:43] unbelievers shouldn't be anyway yeah
[55:46] no unbelievers
[55:50] shouldn't be playing around with
[55:51] Believers for four years
[55:53] just get yourself in trouble
[55:55] if she isn't saved and have nothing to
[55:57] do with her and do the same thing by a
[55:59] young man the trouble our ranks of
[56:02] Christians today is breaking down and
[56:05] marrying and air marrying and it's such
[56:07] a mess so there's nothing could
[56:10] straighten it out we're rapping
[56:13] for judgment that's your profit all
[56:15] right Nick
[56:18] I said that may be all right
[56:21] let's read the first part of it he's a
[56:23] paradox my father raised up and said my
[56:25] son went to the altar he was baptized
[56:27] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:29] and water baptism in the pool said I
[56:31] know my mind's come to Christ I said
[56:33] that may be all right all the outward
[56:35] motions
[56:36] hello all the outward motions
[56:40] right right he might be identified as a
[56:43] Believer with the Believers but until he
[56:45] is regenerated
[56:47] born again I'd advise that young man to
[56:51] never
[56:51] marry a woman
[56:54] he'll make hell on Earth for her until
[56:56] that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of
[56:58] Christ comes in then that will be a
[57:01] paradox in itself to take the very
[57:03] nature of a boy that's bred between
[57:05] father and mother and yet in his
[57:07] intellectually
[57:09] he's trying his best to overcome it and
[57:11] he can't do it no words in humanly you
[57:13] can't overcome your whatever your mom
[57:16] and dad give you right you can't
[57:18] overcome that by yourself
[57:20] that's where daddy said you said well I
[57:22] can't help it because my mom was that
[57:23] way yeah you can he's fixing to tell you
[57:24] yeah yeah and yet in his intellectuals
[57:27] he is trying his best to overcome it
[57:29] he can't do it he'll never overcome it
[57:32] Christ will have to overcome it when he
[57:36] lets Christ in then he's already
[57:37] overcome then
[57:39] it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is
[57:42] born in the spirit of God all right next
[57:44] one
[57:45] 14. young man getting married
[57:48] marry some girl that don't believe or
[57:51] some girl marrying a boy that don't
[57:52] believe oh my God
[57:55] this is for y'all
[58:01] except with your parents actually it
[58:04] won't go on young man getting married
[58:06] marry some girl that don't believe or
[58:07] some young girl marrying a boy that
[58:09] don't believe don't you do it
[58:11] don't do it just do not do it right
[58:14] there's enough Godly women and there's
[58:16] enough Godly men around
[58:18] no he's got somebody for you don't go
[58:20] out and try to push the issue because
[58:22] remember it's still your free moral
[58:24] agency you can override all that like
[58:27] Janet and I were talking a few minutes
[58:28] ago even though you put him in church
[58:30] even though you put them through school
[58:32] even though you can do all the things we
[58:33] did this morning
[58:34] they still got to make their own choice
[58:36] this is not an automatic thing brother
[58:38] Brown said he want an automatic fan
[58:40] right but at least they can't come back
[58:42] to you and say you didn't tell me right
[58:44] now if you raise them right and you give
[58:46] them the right things and the right path
[58:47] to go on if they go away it's nobody's
[58:50] fault but theirs but like Mom said it's
[58:53] always that scripture that comes back
[58:54] that's when they're older raise up a
[58:57] child
[58:58] in the way it should go
[59:00] and when he's older he'll not depart
[59:03] from him did say he went to park promo
[59:05] during the stupid years
[59:07] oh no y'all have stupid ears
[59:11] I mean we all had stupid years some just
[59:14] run longer than others some of you went
[59:17] into overtime double overtime
[59:20] main triple over time
[59:22] but thank God what my background brought
[59:25] me right back to where I'm at now
[59:28] and then God can use somebody like that
[59:30] same way with you and all of you I don't
[59:32] care how cute he is or how cute she is
[59:34] or what those big eyes she's got
[59:36] they'll all fade out one of these days
[59:38] they'll have to wear glasses
[59:42] but brother your soul is going to live
[59:44] forever you be careful what you're doing
[59:48] she ain't a real believer or him a real
[59:50] believer don't you yoke yourself up like
[59:52] that
[59:53] stay away from such it'll cause you
[59:55] trouble down the road now listen to
[59:57] profit listen to brother Dale listen to
[1:00:00] brother Wayne it will cause you problems
[1:00:03] right yeah you may think oh well my
[1:00:07] parents are so strict and this girl is
[1:00:10] something no please please please please
[1:00:12] please because you're gonna always come
[1:00:14] back you know what I told my kids I said
[1:00:16] y'all want to be famous
[1:00:19] you want to be famous
[1:00:21] you want to be famous
[1:00:23] do a hundred percent of what your
[1:00:25] parents tell you to do right you'll be
[1:00:28] famous they'll have you on Oprah they'll
[1:00:31] have you on all these shows
[1:00:33] if you can walk in and sit down and go I
[1:00:36] did everything that my mom and dad told
[1:00:39] me to do
[1:00:41] you be rich
[1:00:43] famous you want to get famous you ain't
[1:00:45] going to play baseball you ain't got to
[1:00:47] play all this other stuff
[1:00:49] just say I did everything my parents
[1:00:51] said to do you'll be an anomaly you'll
[1:00:53] be the only two people in the world
[1:00:57] that's how you get famous do exactly
[1:00:59] what your parents say well if you don't
[1:01:01] do a little bit of what we're trying to
[1:01:02] tell you now you'll do better than most
[1:01:04] but you be careful what you're doing she
[1:01:07] ain't a real believer him a real
[1:01:08] believer don't you yoke yourself up like
[1:01:10] that stay away from sex it'll cause you
[1:01:12] trouble down the road now I wanted to
[1:01:14] clear up something here before we go to
[1:01:16] the next quote
[1:01:18] some of us
[1:01:20] some of us chose wives outside of the
[1:01:24] church but remember I wasn't serving the
[1:01:26] lord either so it wasn't that I it
[1:01:28] wasn't that I chose somebody that was an
[1:01:30] unbeliever no I was an unbeliever
[1:01:32] right okay damn it shows Lisa Lisa
[1:01:36] wasn't part of the you know the message
[1:01:39] of Boyd and Janet there's a bunch of
[1:01:41] them in here so I'm not saying that 100
[1:01:44] of the time you've got to marry believer
[1:01:46] but let me tell you something getting
[1:01:48] closer to the end that we are now right
[1:01:51] you better marry a Believer because you
[1:01:53] don't have time to make a mistake
[1:01:54] there's no time to make mistakes now we
[1:01:57] made our mistakes in the past we're
[1:01:59] trying to get you to not go down that
[1:02:01] path don't go down that road we went
[1:02:03] down listen to what we're telling you
[1:02:06] stay away from such it'll cause you
[1:02:08] trouble down the road now the road's
[1:02:10] getting shorter there the end was right
[1:02:12] here and we were here now the end's
[1:02:14] right here right
[1:02:16] that's right but listen I want you young
[1:02:19] kids to be happy that's what I said when
[1:02:21] when I see two people fall in love and
[1:02:23] do everything exactly like they're
[1:02:24] supposed to do do it by the word of God
[1:02:26] and they're both serving the lord and
[1:02:28] they get married and just keep serving
[1:02:29] the lord to me that's the most beautiful
[1:02:32] picture
[1:02:34] beautiful picture you show me anything
[1:02:36] in the world show me two people that are
[1:02:39] just absolutely in love they come to
[1:02:41] church they serve God they have children
[1:02:43] they have a family he's made a plan
[1:02:45] they've come together with that plan and
[1:02:47] they've decided that the wife's either
[1:02:49] going to stay home and she's going to
[1:02:50] work or we're not going to have kids for
[1:02:52] a few years that don't really matter to
[1:02:53] me I have a plan though have a plan play
[1:02:56] on something all right but it'll cause
[1:02:58] you trouble down the road if you don't
[1:02:59] all right next
[1:03:01] telling you people this is life lessons
[1:03:03] that's right probably even maybe falling
[1:03:05] asleep but
[1:03:06] it's a life lesson
[1:03:08] it's important amen it's important to
[1:03:11] help the people around us
[1:03:14] can two walk together hear scripture
[1:03:17] can two walk together except they'd be
[1:03:20] agreed
[1:03:21] agree it's to meet at a certain place
[1:03:25] now don't look for somebody that's
[1:03:26] easily agreeable with everything
[1:03:35] honey whatever you think you can bring
[1:03:37] three women home tonight that's okay
[1:03:39] honey
[1:03:41] no
[1:03:42] that's not what that's saying
[1:03:46] that says don't look for somebody that's
[1:03:48] easily agreeable with everything but do
[1:03:50] agree to walk together and have the same
[1:03:52] goal
[1:03:53] man all right women think a little
[1:03:56] different than men men think a little
[1:03:57] different than women but if you've got
[1:03:59] the same common goal you two can walk
[1:04:01] together that note what it says you know
[1:04:03] except they'd be agreed
[1:04:05] but not a hundred percent agree you're
[1:04:07] not going to be in your human being
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] like I said just don't look for somebody
[1:04:12] that's just so easily agreeable
[1:04:14] no come together and decide
[1:04:17] you know what's the best thing to do
[1:04:19] talk
[1:04:20] talk
[1:04:23] I'd rather you talk
[1:04:25] than to worry about the complications
[1:04:27] later these things you didn't talk about
[1:04:31] before you get married young men young
[1:04:33] ladies if you find somebody that you're
[1:04:34] that you're agreeable with and that
[1:04:36] you're past the looking stage and past
[1:04:39] the praying stage and going into the
[1:04:41] courtship stage then then you got to sit
[1:04:44] down and talk
[1:04:47] talk about the thing talk about life it
[1:04:50] does not bother me
[1:04:52] that when two people are are totally
[1:04:55] hooked up together plan looked pray they
[1:04:59] look like they're going to get married
[1:05:01] talk about life
[1:05:03] do you want to have kids do you not want
[1:05:05] to have kids when you get two born-again
[1:05:07] people it doesn't bother you get that
[1:05:09] out in the world and that's that's just
[1:05:12] Just A Sign you understand what I'm
[1:05:14] saying but no sit there and plan your
[1:05:16] life out just like brother Brown's
[1:05:17] telling
[1:05:19] if you make a mistake now it's going to
[1:05:20] follow you all went through life right
[1:05:22] there's a lot of us sitting in here the
[1:05:23] same way it's followed us through life
[1:05:25] the mistakes we've made
[1:05:28] let's go to Ephesians 5. I think that's
[1:05:31] the next one in it yes
[1:05:33] for you were sometimes Darkness but now
[1:05:36] you are light in the Lord walk as
[1:05:38] children
[1:05:39] of the light like I said you're not in
[1:05:42] darkness anymore kids
[1:05:43] we have no clue to cover us and say well
[1:05:46] we didn't understand no I'm trying to
[1:05:48] make it just as simple as we can make it
[1:05:51] that we are humans living in human
[1:05:54] bodies doing human things
[1:05:57] God wants us to have a spouse
[1:06:00] God wants us to have a spouse
[1:06:03] a help meet to me that's the perfect
[1:06:06] type of you know like Christ in the
[1:06:08] church he wants us to have a family unit
[1:06:11] that's what he wants we we kind of I
[1:06:14] think we kind of got that basis this
[1:06:15] morning so let's go to the next first
[1:06:17] John 1.
[1:06:19] but if you walk in the light as he is in
[1:06:21] the light we have Fellowship
[1:06:24] one with another in the blood of Jesus
[1:06:26] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:06:29] right you walk right
[1:06:33] woman walk right you walk right together
[1:06:35] you're right in line with Fellowship
[1:06:40] Godly Fellowship not the other kind of
[1:06:42] Fellowship all right now look
[1:06:46] let's look at this one right here just a
[1:06:48] second character
[1:06:50] you know what character is let's go to
[1:06:52] number 15.
[1:06:56] listen to this what he said choosing a
[1:06:57] bride this is in Los Angeles California
[1:07:00] that's always stuck with me now what he
[1:07:02] done remember he married the one on the
[1:07:04] hill in the mansion and the one we
[1:07:06] talked about the other day and he
[1:07:07] married the one that lived in a box car
[1:07:09] this is what he said from that that's
[1:07:12] always stuck with me of how that was one
[1:07:14] chose a beautiful girl the other one
[1:07:17] chose character
[1:07:18] now that's the only way you could choose
[1:07:21] first look for character and then if you
[1:07:23] love her fine
[1:07:25] but now look now this I put this in here
[1:07:27] look guys first Adam he didn't have
[1:07:30] choice for his wife God just gave it to
[1:07:32] him all right he didn't get a choice Don
[1:07:35] just made him one and he didn't get to
[1:07:37] choose her so we found out that she led
[1:07:39] him astray from God's word
[1:07:42] he didn't get to pray over the matter
[1:07:45] he isn't like you and I he didn't get a
[1:07:48] choice
[1:07:49] but you and I get a choice right all
[1:07:51] right let's go to numbers let's go to
[1:07:53] 16.
[1:07:55] Abraham had to do it and call those
[1:07:57] things which were not as though they
[1:07:58] were and he believed God and it was
[1:08:00] imputed to him for righteousness what we
[1:08:02] need today is a wishbone out of a
[1:08:04] backbone putting Christianity right it's
[1:08:07] there
[1:08:08] the thing we need is some born-again
[1:08:11] Christians men and women who will when
[1:08:13] they see trouble Rising I'm talking
[1:08:16] about us today
[1:08:18] when we see trouble Rising
[1:08:20] not slip off fall off and go hide behind
[1:08:24] the corner somewhere not run out this
[1:08:26] way be partakers of it but a man and
[1:08:29] woman who will stand and show their
[1:08:31] color
[1:08:31] even your friends will appreciate you
[1:08:34] more if you will do that right you know
[1:08:36] Dad's exactly right and I'm I don't get
[1:08:40] this wrong I didn't I didn't have
[1:08:42] relations with a lot of girls
[1:08:43] in high school and all but I did have a
[1:08:46] friendly relationship with all of them
[1:08:47] and I knew the ones that were good and I
[1:08:49] knew the ones that were bad
[1:08:51] and I had a whole lot more respect for
[1:08:53] the ones that were good than I did for
[1:08:55] them that was bad
[1:08:57] isn't that true grown-ups don't get a
[1:09:01] reputation it'll follow you all through
[1:09:04] life all right
[1:09:06] so look even your friends will
[1:09:08] appreciate you more if you'll do it what
[1:09:10] stand for something stand for your plan
[1:09:12] in other words do what you're supposed
[1:09:14] to do what man is he that don't
[1:09:16] appreciate a woman
[1:09:22] made of mud and dog with tadpoles
[1:09:26] Laramie
[1:09:28] he could only have said that
[1:09:30] he got by with it nobody would nobody
[1:09:33] just last name probably never be exactly
[1:09:35] as she may be let her be the lady and
[1:09:38] character enough to stand for a woman
[1:09:40] morals
[1:09:42] any man that comes along will take off
[1:09:44] his hat to her if he's got an ounce of
[1:09:47] man in him and if man face that being a
[1:09:50] fallen Son of God what will God himself
[1:09:52] say to a man who will stand up for his
[1:09:54] conviction call right right call wrong
[1:09:56] wrong right all right Amen to that right
[1:09:58] we must be committed and loyal necess
[1:10:01] till death do us part
[1:10:04] watch
[1:10:06] this is what I always look at I'm not
[1:10:08] watching them I watch people
[1:10:10] I watch how people handle a situation
[1:10:13] even even all of us in life now watch
[1:10:16] how you handle a situation so right
[1:10:18] something wrong if you don't ask my
[1:10:19] opinion I don't give it but if you ask
[1:10:21] my opinion you know what you're gonna
[1:10:22] get my opinion
[1:10:24] all right
[1:10:26] but
[1:10:28] guys and girls watch how that person
[1:10:30] handles the situation
[1:10:31] because God may put you in a situation
[1:10:33] sometime just to let that man remember
[1:10:35] brother Brown said God would let
[1:10:37] somebody say something to you he's
[1:10:39] talking about adults now let some let
[1:10:40] somebody say something to you different
[1:10:42] or wrong just to see how you react right
[1:10:45] you want me to find that quote that's
[1:10:46] what he's saying he'll let somebody
[1:10:48] cross your path and say something about
[1:10:50] you or against you just to see how
[1:10:52] you'll react
[1:10:53] same way with here if you've got an
[1:10:56] ounce of man in him
[1:10:59] if a man if a man face it face that
[1:11:02] being a fallen Son of God what would God
[1:11:04] himself say to a man who'll stand up for
[1:11:06] his convictions come on right right
[1:11:08] wrong wrong all right let's go to the
[1:11:10] next one
[1:11:11] 17. we will get finished I'm gonna start
[1:11:15] on we'll do the looking and then we'll
[1:11:17] start on the praying y'all pray for next
[1:11:19] Sunday because that's we'll start into
[1:11:21] the praying part
[1:11:22] now how I would like to border here just
[1:11:25] for a few minutes as it was and getting
[1:11:27] into the core of this on Mother Goose
[1:11:28] City there
[1:11:31] is preaching on
[1:11:32] the invasion of the United States in
[1:11:34] 1954.
[1:11:36] and when a man starts to get married
[1:11:39] the type of a girl woman that he it it's
[1:11:42] more than just lucky Beauty
[1:11:45] you've got to get somebody both soul and
[1:11:47] body going together amen somebody that's
[1:11:50] really going to be your friend and
[1:11:52] Powell that will stick with you through
[1:11:54] thick and thin right he doesn't just say
[1:11:56] no death to us part but it says in
[1:11:58] sickness and in hell
[1:12:01] for richer and for poorer
[1:12:04] do you really realize
[1:12:07] that's right do you really realize what
[1:12:09] you're saying when you make that bow it
[1:12:11] doesn't really matter how poor we get
[1:12:13] I'm staying with him doesn't matter how
[1:12:14] rich we get I'm staying with him doesn't
[1:12:16] matter if I have to work and he can't
[1:12:17] work and he's disabled and we live off
[1:12:20] beans that's what you're saying amen but
[1:12:22] it's so convenient in the in the world
[1:12:24] and the United States has made it so
[1:12:26] easy to go well they said I'll find me a
[1:12:28] well one
[1:12:30] or he's poor I'll find me a rich one
[1:12:33] that's one of the divorce courts are the
[1:12:35] way they are
[1:12:36] but you won't get too godly people to do
[1:12:38] that I've seen people too thick and thin
[1:12:41] they'll that your husband will go down
[1:12:43] and the wife will just pick up or a wife
[1:12:44] will go down the husband to pick up
[1:12:47] you know who's got Garden who doesn't
[1:12:49] because it shows right okay now look
[1:12:54] this right here I'm glad brother Bob
[1:12:57] this is kind of at the end of everything
[1:12:59] you notice I hadn't said a thing about
[1:13:01] love
[1:13:04] planning
[1:13:07] looking
[1:13:09] praying
[1:13:11] when you get past to the looking part
[1:13:13] and start praying because you want when
[1:13:15] we start in the praying part you'll see
[1:13:16] how you're praying
[1:13:18] that you'll fall in love with this
[1:13:20] person
[1:13:21] okay that's what you're going to pray
[1:13:23] you're going to pray that you're going
[1:13:24] to fall in love with this person right
[1:13:25] but you got to look for the right one
[1:13:27] looking for Real Love Is Right Here
[1:13:30] toward the end
[1:13:31] because what if most of us thought was
[1:13:33] this is what most of us thought was the
[1:13:36] only thing to look for well just if you
[1:13:38] love them marry them
[1:13:41] you don't know one thing about love
[1:13:43] right until you've experienced all these
[1:13:46] other things right
[1:13:49] love is a ongoing process
[1:13:52] same way with God you don't really when
[1:13:55] you're born again know the love of God
[1:13:56] do you do you know the true love of God
[1:13:58] we'll never know the true love of God
[1:14:00] even when we get into eternity so we're
[1:14:02] just gonna like I told them the other
[1:14:04] day brother Brandon said it's like a
[1:14:05] little button
[1:14:06] a little button comes into your soul
[1:14:09] that's the earnest of your inheritance
[1:14:11] that's your eternal life that's going to
[1:14:13] get you to heaven that's just the button
[1:14:15] that ain't the whole shirt that's just
[1:14:18] the button all right this is what most
[1:14:21] of us thought was the only thing to look
[1:14:23] for it is not the first thing to look
[1:14:25] for
[1:14:27] but it's important
[1:14:29] do not look for what the world calls
[1:14:31] love because the world's love is what
[1:14:33] selfish and self-centered I I mean me do
[1:14:37] it for me
[1:14:39] that'll make me feel good
[1:14:41] real love does one thing folks it gives
[1:14:45] you remember the you remember the
[1:14:47] illustration where brother Brown said
[1:14:48] Real Love was that if you really love
[1:14:51] the person
[1:14:52] but she told you one day said you know
[1:14:55] what I think I could love this person
[1:14:57] over here a little bit better
[1:15:00] and for you to look at that person and
[1:15:01] say well I want you to have the best in
[1:15:04] life and back off
[1:15:06] that's true blood that's right it'd be
[1:15:09] hard to do
[1:15:10] tell you what I love June but if you
[1:15:11] told me that I probably went crazy
[1:15:14] but I wasn't born again but being born
[1:15:16] again you can say hey I want the best
[1:15:18] for her let's don't be selfish and say
[1:15:20] well what's the best for me no what's
[1:15:22] the best for that person all right real
[1:15:24] love gives of itself you really cannot
[1:15:26] explain true love
[1:15:28] but there's one key I'll read your quote
[1:15:31] with brother when I'm saying that faith
[1:15:32] is the key amen you say faith in love
[1:15:35] brother Brown is going to tell you faith
[1:15:36] is love right and love his face
[1:15:41] number 18.
[1:15:44] this is for you young girls that's not
[1:15:46] married and you Mullins when you meet
[1:15:48] that girl that you love
[1:15:52] love and that's just all there is to it
[1:15:54] or you love him and that you don't care
[1:15:56] whether he's handsome or whether he's
[1:15:58] not handsome or whether she's pretty or
[1:15:59] not pretty that doesn't matter but you
[1:16:01] love them just the same now you better
[1:16:03] watch kind of hold around close there
[1:16:05] because you're getting close to home
[1:16:07] but now look he said the marriage-based
[1:16:09] outside of that is sure to fall
[1:16:12] or it'll never be successful they'll
[1:16:16] never be happy
[1:16:18] all right now let's go to 19.
[1:16:22] absolutely
[1:16:24] you when you get married there had to
[1:16:26] wind back through your mind something
[1:16:28] till you hit that typos
[1:16:31] you get that when you got married there
[1:16:34] had to in other words you have to think
[1:16:36] back
[1:16:37] why did all this happen
[1:16:39] something till you hit that typos
[1:16:42] and it should have been love for your
[1:16:44] wife or your husband well maybe as
[1:16:47] pretty as gun's life or she well she not
[1:16:49] the this that but there is something
[1:16:51] about her that that you it strikes you
[1:16:55] you say she might not be as pretty as
[1:16:58] the other or he might not be as handsome
[1:17:00] as the other but there has to be an
[1:17:02] absolute
[1:17:04] without an absolute there's another
[1:17:06] person involved
[1:17:09] without an absolute there's another
[1:17:10] person involved
[1:17:12] there has to be an absolute there that
[1:17:15] that person is different and there's
[1:17:18] where you hold on to amen
[1:17:26] absolutely number twenty
[1:17:29] be finished in a minute roll it on up
[1:17:34] and faith and love is relation
[1:17:37] because you can't have faith unless you
[1:17:40] got love
[1:17:41] because your faith is in a God who is a
[1:17:43] very essence of love Faith and love work
[1:17:47] together
[1:17:49] here just like a young couple you take a
[1:17:51] young man and your woman and they fall
[1:17:53] in love with one another and as they go
[1:17:55] along and begin to know one another how
[1:17:57] many times I've told you that you don't
[1:17:59] know each other that well
[1:18:00] you've done the best you could but
[1:18:02] you're learning they go along and begin
[1:18:05] to know one another more their heart
[1:18:07] begins to beat as one
[1:18:09] see there there yet they're not husband
[1:18:11] and wife oh you thought you thought
[1:18:13] about getting married no this is just a
[1:18:15] dating process man but their love binds
[1:18:18] them together and they have confidence
[1:18:20] in one another
[1:18:22] now if they really love one another
[1:18:23] really love and you know that this girl
[1:18:26] loves you and she knows that you love
[1:18:27] her You've Got Confidence faith in one
[1:18:31] another if you've got faith in one
[1:18:33] another if you didn't you'd better not
[1:18:34] marry them
[1:18:36] notice you got to have faith and you
[1:18:39] separate them and put one extreme South
[1:18:42] and one extreme North there's still that
[1:18:45] love that beats for one another what
[1:18:46] faith no matter where they're at they're
[1:18:50] just as true to one another as they can
[1:18:52] be because they love one another and if
[1:18:55] you love the Lord It's not trying to
[1:18:57] dodge hell but you love the Lord then
[1:18:59] you have faith in God see and it if you
[1:19:03] love him so faith and love does work
[1:19:05] together faith is the key of this true
[1:19:07] love right so now let's go to 21 and
[1:19:10] this this is the last part
[1:19:13] know the background of the person
[1:19:16] a man when he chooses his life companion
[1:19:18] he usually inquires
[1:19:20] of her life
[1:19:22] family right and so forth what family
[1:19:26] she out of
[1:19:27] and what's her background so forth we
[1:19:30] have to have something like that to give
[1:19:32] a basis you ask her
[1:19:36] now only thing he can take is her word
[1:19:38] that's all he can take and that's all
[1:19:41] she can take from him is his word and
[1:19:43] there's no other way
[1:19:44] all right so let's go to 22 and we'll be
[1:19:46] done right here
[1:19:48] last one
[1:19:50] I've got the noise I read this before
[1:19:52] I'm gonna read it again I've got to know
[1:19:55] what I'm doing before I can have faith
[1:19:57] in what I'm doing
[1:19:59] does that make sense right I gotta know
[1:20:01] what I'm doing before I have faith in it
[1:20:03] like I was telling you many times before
[1:20:06] um
[1:20:07] the reason we have fear is we don't know
[1:20:09] how something works amen I have fear of
[1:20:12] opening that box over there without all
[1:20:14] those electrical wires if somebody just
[1:20:16] pulled all the wires out and and threw
[1:20:19] the breakers everywhere and
[1:20:21] and they told me to put it together what
[1:20:22] there would a fear come upon me I walk
[1:20:25] out there in the shop and look at those
[1:20:27] guys putting those Motors together and
[1:20:28] there's Motor Parts laying everywhere
[1:20:31] well you think they're scared
[1:20:33] Jonathan put the motor together with a
[1:20:35] black with blinders on them
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:38] he had no fear
[1:20:40] because what he understands what he's
[1:20:43] doing if I was a master electrician I'd
[1:20:45] have no more fear of going over and
[1:20:47] putting all those things back together
[1:20:48] and they work then I would of anything
[1:20:51] else
[1:20:52] why the fear is gone yeah
[1:20:54] same way when you're choosing a wife or
[1:20:56] a spouse you gotta have faith I gotta
[1:20:59] know what I'm doing that's what I'm
[1:21:01] trying to teach you basically the young
[1:21:02] people
[1:21:04] learn about your person the person that
[1:21:07] you're looking at we're still in the
[1:21:08] looking state
[1:21:10] I've got to know what I'm doing before I
[1:21:12] can have faith in what I'm doing why'd
[1:21:15] you marry your wife you had faith in her
[1:21:18] you had tried her
[1:21:20] watched her
[1:21:21] seen what she come from and who she was
[1:21:24] I same way with the scripture with God
[1:21:26] that's the same way with God that's the
[1:21:29] same way we're talking about death until
[1:21:30] we understand death and we understand
[1:21:32] the change of the body not that it is to
[1:21:34] change the body but understand it change
[1:21:35] the body we'll have a fear right
[1:21:37] everybody's got a fear of dying I don't
[1:21:39] I don't see her yeah you do
[1:21:41] yeah you do because this unknown thing
[1:21:44] that we don't know anything about but
[1:21:46] through the prophet's message he's given
[1:21:47] us an ability
[1:21:49] to know
[1:21:50] what we're looking for
[1:21:53] right the word look
[1:21:55] when you say when you're somebody when
[1:21:56] you say look what does that mean you
[1:21:59] turn your attention to One Direction
[1:22:01] right right when somebody hollers look
[1:22:04] what's the first thing you do you look
[1:22:05] you try then if it's somebody points you
[1:22:08] ever walked in a room just started doing
[1:22:09] this
[1:22:14] ninety percent of the people in that
[1:22:15] room is going to go
[1:22:19] there's nothing up there
[1:22:21] but you say look and they're looking at
[1:22:25] it that's what I want to tell you look
[1:22:27] when you find somebody that you get your
[1:22:29] attention on really don't just look
[1:22:32] look with a spiritual understanding look
[1:22:35] with the planning and the praying we'll
[1:22:37] get into the praying next Sunday Lord
[1:22:38] willing let's stand so we
[1:22:41] go downstairs and have a little
[1:22:44] cake and ice cream
[1:22:47] but look
[1:22:49] to see in a Direction
[1:22:54] young people
[1:22:55] even us old people
[1:22:57] if we see people struggling
[1:23:00] help them out yeah amen help them out
[1:23:03] we've been there like I said we've been
[1:23:05] there we've done that I know this last
[1:23:07] night it's hard for them to listen
[1:23:08] sometimes
[1:23:12] but by the grace of God
[1:23:17] can find the right spouse amen you can
[1:23:20] you can make the right choice right
[1:23:23] you know why I put my faith in that
[1:23:25] because like I said
[1:23:27] God has purposed us to be this way
[1:23:30] that's where I look at life brother call
[1:23:32] it God's purpose has to be this way live
[1:23:34] have children have a family have a
[1:23:37] church family be able to understand what
[1:23:39] happens in life and to be understand
[1:23:40] what happens in the spiritual life and
[1:23:44] when you do that that you're well you're
[1:23:46] a well-rounded individual but you must
[1:23:47] have a plan
[1:23:48] right plan
[1:23:51] look and next Sunday we'll talk about
[1:23:53] praying you know the Lord amen amen I
[1:23:56] love him for what he's given us the
[1:23:58] grace he's given us
[1:23:59] Grace has got to be in all this when you
[1:24:02] put love when you say the word love to
[1:24:04] me that's great
[1:24:06] because he loved us give us Grace enough
[1:24:08] to love us in the way that we are and
[1:24:11] give us Grace and and that we didn't
[1:24:13] make the right choice at one time
[1:24:16] Henry amen
[1:24:19] we were out in the world we did the
[1:24:21] things in the world we didn't listen to
[1:24:22] God we didn't listen to our parents we
[1:24:24] listened to nothing but the devil
[1:24:26] and it's interrupted our life until this
[1:24:29] point right here you know I've always
[1:24:31] said let me say this before we sing I've
[1:24:33] always said and I know there's
[1:24:35] implications of marriage and divorce in
[1:24:36] the spiritual but even in natural God
[1:24:38] knew that as human beings if there was
[1:24:40] divorce there'd be two families
[1:24:44] they're all gonna be in struggle
[1:24:47] it's always going to be a struggle
[1:24:48] regardless of all the other things that
[1:24:50] he told us about there's always going to
[1:24:51] be when you split somebody that's
[1:24:53] supposed to be one
[1:24:54] walking is one family is one when you
[1:24:56] split them apart and then this one
[1:24:58] marries another one and this one there's
[1:24:59] another one you got a lot of mix of

[1:37:38] little glimpses of it but we really
[1:37:40] don't understand
[1:37:41] like that little button that he gave us
[1:37:44] said let there be one day
[1:37:46] and a world came into existence that's
[1:37:48] right a whole universe was flung off of

[1:38:00] the new Birds if you're born again you
[1:38:01] were there I mean you were there the
[1:38:03] eternal life you have was there with him
[1:38:05] and said let there be
[1:38:06] part of the creator
[1:38:08] that's why brother around said we got
[1:38:10] enough in us that little button can go
[1:38:12] create a world and live on it but we're
[1:38:14] holding here because we don't need to do
[1:38:16] that right now we don't need that we
[1:38:18] need to live our life here
[1:38:19] we need to do things we ought to do here
[1:38:21] we need to have family and we need to
[1:38:23] raise our family and raise our kids to
