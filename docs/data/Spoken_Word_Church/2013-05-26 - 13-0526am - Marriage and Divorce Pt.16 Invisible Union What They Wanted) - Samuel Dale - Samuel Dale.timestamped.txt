[1:23] i want to see him don't you in a day in
[1:26] an hour and a time when everything's
[1:28] falling apart we have an opportunity
[1:30] to look into god's word and find him and
[1:33] be able to find him for ourselves and
[1:35] to walk in
[1:37] in the love of the lord
[1:39] it was a great day and a great time
[1:41] man remember the sick among us remember
[1:44] sister peggy gibeon and operation on her
[1:46] foot and everything and just
[1:47] remember that the lord would would be
[1:50] with her and bless her and take care of
[1:51] him he'd like to turn to our scripture
[1:53] we're
[1:54] reading in romans 7.
[1:57] now what we're doing is we're titling
[1:59] these
[2:00] to where that we're still in the series
[2:03] called marriage and divorce
[2:05] and we'll keep that point but then our
[2:07] thought is the invisible union
[2:10] so then we're moving on over and that's
[2:12] why we're not reading the scripture
[2:14] in matthew of marriage and divorce we're
[2:17] moving into the greater portion
[2:20] of marriage and divorce the moving into
[2:23] how that we're separated from the law
[2:26] so just keep those things in mind and
[2:28] then you know we'll have it all bunched
[2:31] up in one
[2:32] one thought or one series all right
[2:34] romans seven heavenly father we thank
[2:37] you for your love and your grace unto us
[2:39] we thank you for calvary thank you for
[2:41] salvation thank you for peace and joy
[2:44] and love lord in you and we just ask you
[2:46] to have your way that you may lord
[2:49] guide each and every one of us into thy
[2:51] grace and love
[2:53] and lord that you would touch the sick
[2:54] among us because that's what we desire
[2:57] we desire to see you manifest yourself
[3:00] among us in a mighty way and lord just
[3:02] come and have your way you said you sent
[3:04] your word
[3:05] and healed us so we just believe you and
[3:08] we thank you have your way now god god
[3:10] each and every one forgive our sins and
[3:12] keep us in jesus name
[3:14] amen
[3:16] romans 7.
[3:21] no ye not brethren for i speak to them
[3:23] that know the law
[3:25] and that the law hath dominion over a
[3:27] man as long as he liveth
[3:29] for the woman which hath and husband is
[3:30] bound by the law to her husband
[3:33] so long as he liveth but if the husband
[3:35] be dead
[3:36] she is loose from the law of her husband
[3:38] so then
[3:39] if while her husband lives she'll be
[3:41] married to another man she shall be
[3:44] called an adulteress but if her husband
[3:46] be dead she is free from that law so
[3:48] that she is no adulteress though she be
[3:50] married to another man
[3:52] wherefore my brethren ye also are come
[3:54] become dead to the law by the body of
[3:56] christ that you should be married to
[3:58] another even to him who is raised from
[4:00] the dead
[4:02] that we should walk excuse me that we
[4:04] should bring forth fruit under god
[4:07] for when we were in the flesh the
[4:09] motions of sin which were by the law did
[4:12] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[4:14] unto death
[4:15] but now we are delivered from the law
[4:18] that being dead were in we were hell
[4:20] that we should serve in the newness of
[4:22] spirit and not in the letter wholeness
[4:26] of the letter so you may be seated the
[4:28] lord had his blessing
[4:29] to the reading of the word
[4:33] i said we're we're trying to
[4:37] get into
[4:38] what
[4:39] brother brown said paul was doing
[4:43] and you know getting into the greater
[4:45] portion
[4:47] of marriage and divorce
[4:49] and how that christ is to set us free
[4:52] and not to just be forgiven
[4:54] but wind up to a basis to where that we
[4:56] will be totally justified
[5:00] and then knowing that we're illustrating
[5:02] he was
[5:03] here in romans 7
[5:06] illustrating the relationship the
[5:08] prophet said paragraph 43 of the
[5:09] invisible union said he's illustrating
[5:12] the relationship
[5:13] of bride to christ
[5:16] and you know then brother branham when
[5:18] he gets into it he says now
[5:20] i'm not talking about you women i'm just
[5:23] illustrating he said what you are is
[5:26] between you and the lord
[5:28] all right see we want to read the book
[5:30] and we just want to get in to
[5:32] do this don't do that
[5:34] and come to find out we're still under
[5:36] the law
[5:37] and that's what we're trying to do we're
[5:39] trying to to speak on these things to
[5:41] give us illustrations or understanding
[5:45] brown said it that paragraph 81 it says
[5:48] this is to show where the church stands
[5:52] the church the bride
[5:54] all right
[5:55] and if doing that then
[5:57] you know why would we be concerned with
[5:59] other things in trying to figure it out
[6:01] and all why not just believe what god
[6:04] says see paul is showing that the woman
[6:08] cannot divorce her husband
[6:10] and remarry on any ex
[6:12] circumstances
[6:14] except he be dead that's the only
[6:18] justificational point that the mother
[6:20] the woman has all right she's bound by
[6:23] the law now you say yeah but the law was
[6:26] done away in christ
[6:29] we're not under the law anymore
[6:31] well
[6:33] it's odd that paul was preaching to
[6:35] people that
[6:37] was already born again christians
[6:40] and that's what he was telling them
[6:42] you know
[6:43] and speaking like the law was still in
[6:45] existence
[6:48] you say yeah but but i don't understand
[6:49] you brother dale because you you you
[6:52] just don't preach like other people i
[6:54] agree with you i don't that's
[6:56] that's the difference in me and
[6:57] everybody else i guess
[7:00] but i'm trying to get you and i to see
[7:01] what we are today
[7:04] remember the bible is talking about what
[7:06] you and i are now
[7:08] what happened before
[7:11] if you're going to take the bible as a
[7:13] doing you might as well just rip out
[7:15] everything over to the book of
[7:16] revelations and hang on to about half of
[7:18] that
[7:20] because the rest of it is about somebody
[7:22] else
[7:26] well we we read it and we don't want it
[7:27] related but see it's all supposed to
[7:29] bring us all to a
[7:31] relationship with christ amen
[7:35] you know a salvation
[7:37] of doings but yet see we just we just
[7:40] want to take what we want to take
[7:43] and believe what we want to believe
[7:45] all right and then that way see we
[7:47] really get into trouble
[7:48] all right
[7:49] now remember how we were bringing out
[7:51] this past wednesday
[7:54] that
[7:56] even in verse 1
[7:59] of romans 7 there it says that
[8:01] the man is under the law
[8:06] we say oh it's just a woman it's just a
[8:09] you know imagine divorce that's all just
[8:10] woman's side that's
[8:12] well
[8:13] go ahead and do what you want to
[8:15] because we've done been around here 50
[8:17] years almost because of
[8:19] of misinterpreted theologies of mankind
[8:23] so i guess we got 50 more to go of
[8:26] course most of us ain't going to make it
[8:27] that way
[8:28] we're going to go by the grave we're
[8:30] going to march around horeb until this
[8:32] thing is all over with
[8:34] all right so we just might as well
[8:36] settle down and figure out we can go on
[8:37] or whatever we can do
[8:39] all right but remember we were bringing
[8:41] out where paul says it to man
[8:44] the
[8:45] that he's bound by the law
[8:48] as long as he liveth
[8:51] he he's not just talking about the ten
[8:54] commandments
[8:55] he's talking about the entire word of
[8:57] god because that's what we took the
[8:58] whole service about
[9:00] when you say law most people say ten
[9:02] commandments
[9:05] but the law is the bible the word of god
[9:10] the letter of the word is law
[9:13] until we're born again
[9:16] if we're not born again it's still law
[9:18] he said no no the law was done away with
[9:21] christ
[9:22] that's for the born-again believer
[9:26] the law wasn't done away when christ
[9:27] died the law was magnified
[9:33] it wasn't done away and he ended you say
[9:35] yeah but brother so-and-so i don't care
[9:36] what brother so-and-so said what does
[9:38] the bible say and what the prophet has
[9:40] to say
[9:41] we better get down to a seriousness of
[9:43] thinking it over
[9:45] because i tried to bring it out there
[9:46] wednesday and i'll keep trying to bring
[9:48] it out see we we want to take what
[9:50] somebody says
[9:54] well i remember a couple of guys named
[9:56] nathan and cora
[9:58] that made up their mind that they were
[10:00] spiritual also
[10:02] you know moses never argued with him
[10:04] about whether they were spiritual or not
[10:06] right
[10:07] he wanted everybody to be spiritual
[10:10] right
[10:11] he wanted everybody to experience god
[10:14] amen in the way that he had done
[10:17] all right anybody that's ever
[10:18] experienced god wants everybody else to
[10:20] see it that way
[10:22] but yet dathan and coracy they said
[10:24] you take too much upon yourself
[10:27] we the people are spiritual
[10:30] i mean there's really meaning unto them
[10:31] too was but they were saying it you know
[10:33] where it would go out and make everybody
[10:35] feel good because that's the way
[10:37] preachers are you know we we are the
[10:39] word but you got to come to me
[10:42] you know so that's law
[10:45] but you remember how it says there the
[10:47] man i told you in romans 7 then it's not
[10:50] saying that because that word is 44 44
[10:53] let's see
[10:54] 444 i think it is in strong's
[10:57] it means for the word man
[10:59] in verse one
[11:01] it means a human being whether male or
[11:03] female
[11:06] generically or how you pronounce that
[11:08] word
[11:09] to include all human individuals
[11:13] in other words i've always tried to get
[11:15] you to see and you'll read where brother
[11:16] branham will say
[11:17] that
[11:18] that man that word man means mankind
[11:22] it's not just the man he's got a one way
[11:25] the woman's got another way
[11:27] you know but we're we're not bound by
[11:29] these things we're only bound by this
[11:31] well that's the problem
[11:34] my that's my whole thought now for the
[11:36] next six months is one thing
[11:40] brother branham said we are free from
[11:41] sin
[11:45] he said but we're bound by our creeds
[11:51] i don't have no creeds bless god
[11:54] well you just opened your mouth and said
[11:56] you had some yeah
[11:57] because by saying it that way you'd
[11:59] openly you you got offended some reason
[12:01] or something
[12:02] so it shows that that demon in there is
[12:05] teaching you those things is getting
[12:08] exposed right you wouldn't be that way
[12:12] now sorry to be blunt but
[12:14] isn't it time to be
[12:17] now think about it i'll have to got
[12:19] trying to go slow today my whole sinuses
[12:21] been acting up and
[12:22] i get to hollering very much i'll be
[12:24] like the little boy that
[12:26] told a preacher that time said you
[12:27] hotter than the church reason you can't
[12:29] talk
[12:30] so uh i'll try to slow down a little
[12:33] but now listen
[12:35] so then paul is speaking to mankind
[12:42] and he's saying mankind is bound by the
[12:45] law
[12:47] as long as he
[12:50] liveth well you just
[12:53] you just don't understand we're born
[12:55] again that's only in the soul
[12:59] you're not born again in your body and
[13:01] spirit
[13:03] you're still subject to life right
[13:06] subject to the law
[13:09] no the law is done away and beside us
[13:11] gentiles never was under the law you
[13:13] think that is not a doctrine
[13:16] go out and find out
[13:18] who finds you a good baptist and nothing
[13:19] else they'll tell you about it the law
[13:21] ended at calvary we and we never was
[13:24] under the law just the jews
[13:27] well how many doctrines is in the
[13:29] message like that
[13:31] all right
[13:33] now watch though paul is illustrating
[13:37] now
[13:40] he's illustrating that a man
[13:44] as long as he's immortal you know human
[13:46] being
[13:49] we are bound by the law
[13:52] which is a do's and don'ts point
[13:57] trying to do something to save ourselves
[13:59] as we'll get into in a minute this
[14:01] reason i had to cut off wednesday and
[14:03] just jump over and
[14:05] you know not cover these
[14:09] but then he goes on to illustrate even
[14:11] greater
[14:14] and he says that the the woman is bound
[14:17] to the law of her husband
[14:21] now
[14:22] we are supposed to be the bride of jesus
[14:25] christ
[14:26] right
[14:28] he is supposed to be our husband
[14:32] okay
[14:34] so now we're bound to the law of that
[14:36] husband which is the word of god
[14:38] which is every word of god
[14:44] see then when when we talk about it you
[14:46] know people say
[14:48] it's not in the new testament about
[14:49] women wearing britches that's an old
[14:52] testament scripture
[14:54] well
[14:57] i thought hebrews 13 8 said he was the
[14:59] same yesterday today and forever but
[15:01] i guess we missed that somewhere
[15:05] but think about it
[15:09] you and i now if you don't get anything
[15:11] out of this whole series get this one
[15:13] point
[15:14] whether you think it believe it whatever
[15:15] it is that's nothing to me i'm just the
[15:17] preacher
[15:20] if we think
[15:22] that there's anything
[15:25] that we didn't do or did do
[15:28] that brought us to salvation or born a
[15:31] certain way or a certain lineage or my
[15:33] mom and daddy was christians or whatnot
[15:36] if we think any of that that's the
[15:38] person i'm talking about
[15:41] if we think there's anything that we can
[15:43] do
[15:46] to save ourselves then salvation is not
[15:48] of the lord
[15:53] yeah but you you don't have got it
[15:55] written in here so go ahead you say but
[15:57] you don't want us to live good brother
[15:58] dale no i want you to get born again
[16:03] then we'll get down to where brother
[16:04] random says it like this
[16:06] he says is there anything we can do he
[16:08] said yes
[16:10] we can yield ourselves to god
[16:13] and live
[16:15] what he wants us to live
[16:19] see it's hard to preach the truth
[16:20] because people the way they pull you
[16:22] apart upon your thoughts and statements
[16:28] the prophet said
[16:31] no matter how
[16:32] much you holler and scream and shout
[16:36] he said make sure you walk straight when
[16:38] you come down
[16:40] now what's he saying
[16:43] do you think brother branham or the
[16:44] bible in any way ever had any reference
[16:47] to the fact that we could just
[16:49] live like the devil and it'd be all
[16:51] right
[16:55] paul said god forbid
[16:58] paul said whoever i yield myself to
[17:02] is my master
[17:05] but yet paul was a human
[17:09] that understood human things
[17:12] we'll get to romans 7 on over in a
[17:14] little more romans 8.
[17:18] and see we we're back in the
[17:20] denominations and then we they believed
[17:22] that paul never got born again until the
[17:25] eighth chapter of romans
[17:28] and he finally got saved
[17:29] you know
[17:31] because that that was the way that
[17:32] justified the fact of him talking about
[17:35] the things he would he did not the
[17:37] things he did it would not you know when
[17:38] i served it is that or so with the
[17:40] spirit i serve the law of the inward man
[17:42] but with the flesh i serve so i just
[17:44] can't help doing wrong
[17:47] well you think you live perfect
[17:51] you know what to say
[17:55] no because nobody can live perfect if we
[17:57] did we wouldn't need a savior
[18:02] yet if we don't
[18:05] serve god
[18:09] then we prove our loss
[18:11] how much more could anybody say brother
[18:13] dale don't preach on clothes and hide
[18:15] what else could i say
[18:18] but everyone said there's no way you
[18:20] could get a holy ghost for a woman to
[18:21] put on a pair of pants
[18:28] now quote a few more
[18:32] he said if you're a born-again christian
[18:33] you can't wait for the doors to open
[18:40] but yet we're just getting word that we
[18:41] used to think about having to build on
[18:43] the building i think now we need to rope
[18:45] off a couple of two or three back rows
[18:47] that's right
[18:48] you know
[18:52] see that's just the way we are
[18:57] but we're not under law
[19:02] so think about it now
[19:07] the law
[19:08] the letter of the word
[19:11] now the letter of the word
[19:14] will always be with us
[19:18] and will always be
[19:20] a form of condemnation
[19:29] brother brown said they didn't get what
[19:30] they thought they got
[19:33] he said they got god in a letter formed
[19:37] you know he calls the ten commandments
[19:39] to seals
[19:43] he said when the seals came and the
[19:44] commandments came
[19:48] he didn't have any trouble taking the
[19:49] old testament to apply it to the new
[19:51] testament did he
[19:55] but think on it now
[19:58] the law then as i tried to bring out
[20:00] wednesday and then i'll move on
[20:01] the law is the letter of god's word
[20:08] and the letter of god's word
[20:10] will never bring us to
[20:14] the letter now keeping the letter
[20:16] it's fine wonderful that's great
[20:20] but it'll never save us
[20:26] to keep the law to the letter could
[20:28] never save us
[20:32] yeah but it and it would it would make a
[20:34] wonderful person
[20:41] but could it be as we'll get to it a
[20:42] while or did it try to wednesday where
[20:44] paul said
[20:45] the thing i thought was life
[20:51] keeping the law to the letter he thought
[20:53] was life
[20:55] but he said i found it to be death
[21:05] he says in second corinthians 3 and 6
[21:07] for the letter killeth
[21:10] but the spirit giveth life
[21:14] see without the holy spirit see what
[21:16] they needed back there
[21:20] what they needed in the old testament
[21:22] was the new birth right
[21:26] you just think about those pharisees
[21:29] that had spent their whole life
[21:32] studying the word of god
[21:38] and all they done was talked about god
[21:41] and his word
[21:43] and yet he walked out there one day and
[21:44] they rejected him and killed him
[21:50] and he came exactly the way the word
[21:52] said he would come didn't it
[21:59] we see if they'd had the new birth what
[22:00] would have happened
[22:05] well we know it couldn't have come to
[22:07] jesus christ died we know that for
[22:09] certainty
[22:10] but i'm driving a point hard to think
[22:12] about it
[22:16] you just think about what it would be if
[22:18] you could have the new birth with an old
[22:20] testament person or a person that had
[22:22] studied the word
[22:26] what about the people in the land today
[22:28] that there's people that that can
[22:31] memorize and
[22:32] and quote the entire bible
[22:37] but yet where are they today
[22:42] well they're in church helping people
[22:44] helping people do what try to memorize
[22:46] something
[22:51] so you ain't listened evidently
[22:54] or some of you would at least amen some
[22:56] of you older ones
[22:57] that people used to they'd say
[23:00] you know well so and so they
[23:02] they died a bad part
[23:04] you throwing off on them you think you
[23:06] perfect i remember when he gave two
[23:09] dollars an offering plate
[23:13] he said oh that's silly yeah well i the
[23:15] other one was i remember when he painted
[23:17] the church and paved the parking lot
[23:19] so that gets down to more seriousness
[23:21] don't it
[23:22] you ever heard a preacher preach anybody
[23:24] into hell
[23:27] i've never heard one yet of you i mean
[23:29] literally preached somebody into hell
[23:32] they've always got a way to get them
[23:34] somewhere
[23:40] amen
[23:41] now listen
[23:45] why
[23:46] would israel
[23:47] is my point thank them
[23:51] is we tried to end up wednesday talking
[23:54] why would israel want
[23:56] the law
[24:01] when they had grace
[24:06] grace was waiting for law right come on
[24:09] they had an atonement
[24:12] they had a pillar of fire leading them
[24:14] they had a prophet to direct them
[24:19] and the spirit of god to dwell among
[24:21] them in a mighty wonderful way
[24:26] why would they want law
[24:33] that's what i said it's hard to even
[24:34] read during in in uh
[24:37] exodus
[24:39] and read that and look like it looks
[24:41] like there that god was giving it to him
[24:43] gonna make him take it
[24:48] brother ronan said that was the greatest
[24:49] mistake they made
[24:53] he said it was never the will of god to
[24:55] give the law we've got to quote flynn
[24:56] here we had them wednesday
[24:58] they'd just back away and come
[25:06] why would you want law
[25:09] when you got everything else
[25:13] now watch the two biggest mistakes
[25:15] israel ever made and this i wanted to
[25:17] borrow this on your heart
[25:20] they first wanted law
[25:22] something they could do
[25:26] that led them to wanting a king
[25:32] they never chose god never chose saul
[25:36] the people chose saul
[25:41] god chose david
[25:43] never joe saul
[25:48] but you see
[25:50] brother branham said he didn't want them
[25:52] to have a king
[25:55] you can go through explaining all the
[25:57] things and reading all the things that
[25:58] the king would make them do and all that
[26:00] but to sum it up in one little point
[26:06] god didn't want israel bowing before
[26:08] king
[26:12] now who would be wanting that to take
[26:14] place then
[26:17] if it wasn't god
[26:20] would not that be the devil's inroad of
[26:23] getting worship
[26:29] come on
[26:30] think on these things
[26:33] but there was no saving power
[26:37] in the law
[26:42] well brother dale you're just against
[26:43] the law
[26:44] no
[26:49] not if i can bring it around make it to
[26:50] ten commandments bring that down and put
[26:52] it into the seals i don't think i'd
[26:53] argue too much about that and that's
[26:55] been done so i don't worry about it
[27:03] but if there was no grace
[27:06] no saving power
[27:10] in the law
[27:11] why would anybody want it
[27:16] they already had grace
[27:18] they already had salvation
[27:21] you realize what they done
[27:23] they turned down salvation
[27:26] they turned down the grace of god
[27:30] to get something to do
[27:36] why is it that people don't want to hear
[27:38] grace preached on in the correct way
[27:43] they'd rather hear little do's and
[27:44] don'ts and
[27:45] you know beat you over there
[27:47] you know stomp your shoes a little bit
[27:50] they go home feeling good
[27:53] but just remember about two days later
[27:55] you're gonna feel bad again
[27:57] but if you get a revelation you can last
[27:59] a whole week
[28:02] whole year off just one revelation
[28:05] right
[28:07] but if there was no grace in the law and
[28:10] there was no saving power in the law
[28:13] why would man want it
[28:19] see there had to be another motive
[28:21] inside of them
[28:25] that would come on out eventually
[28:28] and show what mankind really wants
[28:37] they said about dathan and cora moses
[28:39] never argued with him he didn't say no
[28:41] you know no you ain't spiritual no he
[28:43] doesn't he said we're all spiritual
[28:48] he said you're going at it wrong
[28:54] see they didn't believe in a one-man
[28:55] message right
[29:00] and that's what israel couldn't stand
[29:03] that's what the pharisees couldn't stand
[29:08] it was a one-man message
[29:10] that's what the denomination's in the
[29:11] last days can't stand
[29:14] it's a one-man message
[29:17] we all just make too much of
[29:19] that man y'all call brother branham
[29:25] no paul said follow me as i follow
[29:27] christ
[29:28] well no problem
[29:31] well i'll follow christ ain't going to
[29:32] follow him will
[29:34] you know what you're saying i'm not
[29:35] going to follow paul
[29:38] now that's the point i wanted for us to
[29:41] think about
[29:43] within our own sales
[29:50] and see i wish i could go back into the
[29:52] parts of wednesday but it'd take too
[29:53] long
[29:55] but you just think
[29:58] exodus 19 it literally looks like
[30:02] because god said you are this you are
[30:05] this you're that you're this you're that
[30:07] you're this you're the royal priesthood
[30:08] you're chosen people you're this and as
[30:10] long as you do what's right everything
[30:12] is great and wonderful
[30:14] and you're on your way to the promised
[30:15] land
[30:21] and they said
[30:23] whatever god says
[30:25] for us to do
[30:27] will do
[30:34] but yet it turned out to be the most
[30:36] horrible mistake they ever made
[30:43] the golden calf was a problem
[30:49] god looked over those things
[30:56] remember if they'd sinned 10 times
[30:58] between the time of leaving egypt to
[31:01] cadiz barnea the bible even records ten
[31:03] times that they sinned against god
[31:08] and yet god says we're going to the
[31:09] promised land
[31:18] but yet when they got to the
[31:21] point they chose law
[31:27] he said yeah but the promised land and
[31:28] all this was way back over
[31:30] that's what i'm getting at there was a
[31:32] spirit coming down
[31:35] because 2 out of 12 was all that wanted
[31:38] to go in the promised land well three
[31:40] count moses
[31:44] see they had already
[31:47] begin to accept satan's lie
[31:54] right
[31:56] so then when it would come to the time
[31:58] of moses
[32:01] you know that god gave them the desire
[32:03] of their heart
[32:09] if you don't get nothing more out of get
[32:11] that point that's what i tried to end up
[32:13] wednesday just stopping and
[32:15] going on
[32:19] god will give you the desire of your
[32:21] heart
[32:26] the children of israel wanted meat
[32:29] right you remember that one
[32:33] and he gave it to him but while the meat
[32:35] was in their teeth it was plague struck
[32:42] but could we be in the same shape today
[32:47] no no we're believers in the message
[32:50] well
[32:52] as i ended the thought up saying
[32:55] and i have it written back in here to
[32:56] get to it again if we have time for
[32:58] don't do it this evening
[33:02] when the blind man was healed
[33:09] the people said
[33:11] they're going to argue they couldn't
[33:12] argue about the healing right right
[33:15] and they couldn't say the healing
[33:16] healing wasn't of god
[33:20] but what did they say to
[33:22] him he told him who it was you know to
[33:26] open his eyes
[33:28] you're his disciples
[33:32] we're moses disciples
[33:36] in other words we got moses
[33:42] and by taking it like that
[33:45] that is what killed them
[33:48] was by saying we're moses disciples
[33:54] that's that's horrible in it
[33:57] but there's no grace whatsoever there's
[34:00] no saving power
[34:02] in the law
[34:07] it was given as a policeman to put us in
[34:09] jail
[34:13] and that's trying to explain the other
[34:14] day and i know they don't need trying to
[34:16] explain because everybody's going to
[34:16] argue anyway
[34:18] but if you're going one mile over the
[34:19] speed limit the law has a right to put
[34:21] you in jail
[34:24] they might give you a little grace or
[34:25] whatever this is or that but they got a
[34:27] right to
[34:28] if you steal they got a right put you in
[34:30] jail
[34:33] and they can't do that to me i'm
[34:34] american citizen
[34:37] yeah
[34:39] they'll judge that
[34:43] see there's no grace in the law
[34:51] but jesus christ never come to do away
[34:53] with the law
[34:55] he come to magnify it make it honorable
[34:58] the scripture says
[35:02] because paul said the law is spiritual
[35:09] he said but i'm carnal
[35:14] now him are born again a christian why
[35:16] would he be talking about him being
[35:17] carnal
[35:22] don't you think he was a christian
[35:25] sure but think about it let's read a
[35:27] little bit
[35:30] go ahead with number one brother
[35:32] hear him
[35:33] 57 925
[35:36] e31
[35:41] what if we took the
[35:43] there's no flesh justified by the law
[35:48] moses represented the law
[35:52] the law has no salvation
[35:56] now you say well i don't believe what
[35:58] you're saying well then you're going to
[35:59] read what brother branham said let's see
[36:01] if you argue him
[36:02] of course the same spirit in you said i
[36:04] ain't going to agree what brother dale
[36:06] said if i say the truth it's going to
[36:08] you're going to say the same thing about
[36:10] what brother branham said then you're
[36:12] going to run over to some of these
[36:13] churches now that's proven he's wrong
[36:14] here and wrong there because that way
[36:16] you justify
[36:19] people's got to have something see by
[36:20] being a human being we've got to have
[36:22] something to hold on to
[36:26] even if it's proving everybody else
[36:27] wrong
[36:29] you know
[36:30] so the law is a policeman
[36:32] the law brings you under condemnation
[36:34] the law puts you in jail
[36:37] it has nothing to bring you out with it
[36:40] just jails you and tells you you're a
[36:42] sinner and guilty
[36:43] that's what elijah represented
[36:46] he represented the law
[36:48] all right go to the next one just get a
[36:50] few things read and then we'll get back
[36:52] to our point go to paradox
[36:56] now if some of these jumps up when we
[36:57] get on the wrong thing how do i remember
[36:59] my printer wasn't working at the house
[37:01] and i had to come here and get it all
[37:03] straightened back up and
[37:05] redone because i couldn't print nothing
[37:07] there
[37:09] this is a message called paradox 1965
[37:13] 16-17 they started out really with grace
[37:16] to begin with
[37:18] before they had the law they had grace
[37:20] while they were in egypt
[37:24] without law
[37:27] no one down there
[37:29] was just a priest and so forth
[37:31] but they didn't have any laws they
[37:32] didn't have that while they were in
[37:33] egypt they come on out they're saying a
[37:35] while ago but they were laying the thing
[37:38] was getting in order
[37:40] the law had not been given grace
[37:42] provided them a prophet
[37:44] and also grace provided an atonement
[37:47] a sacrificial lamb we're getting into
[37:49] that this week on the sacrifice the
[37:52] blood because there are lays your
[37:54] healings the atonement had been provided
[37:56] before there was any law grace was
[37:59] before law during the law and after the
[38:01] law
[38:03] joshua was dire to represent as we gave
[38:05] the other night
[38:07] grace but he could not read what the
[38:09] prophet said he could it couldn't be
[38:11] enforced joshua represented
[38:14] the grace but it couldn't be enforced
[38:15] while law was in existence
[38:20] may i say it this way if you and i think
[38:24] that we've done anything to save
[38:26] ourselves we're not saved by grace
[38:32] grace is you accepting a pardon
[38:37] that's all we got that we can do
[38:41] i'd like to get on down into that one
[38:42] but one of these days the prophet said
[38:44] this church is going to come to an
[38:46] ephesians again but we won't get to our
[38:48] go ahead
[38:50] do number 2a
[38:54] which you hear him program 31
[38:57] 57 725
[39:01] what if we took the law
[39:05] there's no flesh justified by the law
[39:07] moses represented the law law has no
[39:09] salvation laws of policemen let's see is
[39:11] that the same quote
[39:13] yeah okay all right that's what i said i
[39:15] double quoted him
[39:16] okay we'll go on
[39:20] because i had all these laying on there
[39:21] go ahead to the next
[39:23] 2b
[39:24] go to b
[39:27] this is your hymn which is preaching 57
[39:30] 807.
[39:33] how would you try to keep the law
[39:35] no man is justified by the law no flesh
[39:37] can be saved by the law the law had no
[39:40] salvation the law was a prison house
[39:44] now
[39:45] see we want to say was
[39:49] that's not what i'm talking about
[39:53] if paul was talking about him with a
[39:55] carnality about him
[39:58] in life and talking about that the man
[40:01] is under the law as long as he liveth
[40:04] then we're still under the law
[40:09] of carnal commandments
[40:14] no i'm born again
[40:16] that's for the soul
[40:19] why did the prophet say we had the
[40:20] marriage in divorce situation
[40:23] misinterpreted theology
[40:28] all right
[40:30] the law was a prison house the law
[40:32] come and told you he was a sinner and
[40:35] put you in jail but had no power to
[40:37] bring you out so i won't i wouldn't want
[40:39] to be a prisoner and that's what the law
[40:41] does shuts you up condemns you says
[40:44] thou shalt not if you do it you're in
[40:47] prison there's no way of getting out
[40:50] so i wouldn't want the law but peter
[40:52] wanted to build a denomination
[40:54] and call it the law
[40:56] do you remember where peter was at on
[40:58] the mount of transfiguration let us
[41:00] build three tabernacles
[41:02] he wanted to build a denomination
[41:10] think on these things as we read them
[41:12] look at number 2c
[41:15] hebrews chapter 1
[41:17] 57 8 31.
[41:22] now the law was a type of the grace
[41:26] the law had no saving power in it
[41:29] law only was a the law was a policeman
[41:32] the policeman put you in jail but you
[41:34] see
[41:35] you're taking grace to get you out
[41:37] so the blood of jesus christ would have
[41:39] to come and set us free
[41:42] now i'm trying to get all of this lined
[41:43] up to word that i can preach on the
[41:46] invisible union and bring
[41:48] it forth of the new birth
[41:50] all right
[41:51] but it was a policeman
[41:53] he told you you was a sinner
[41:58] there's nothing else you could do
[41:59] okay going to number three
[42:03] let's see what your prophet had to say
[42:07] that's 2d going to number three
[42:11] try to bypass some of these things
[42:14] this is taking abraham's covenant
[42:16] 1961-317 e-17
[42:24] abraham to come by faith abraham never
[42:26] received this promise while he was in
[42:28] circumcision
[42:30] under the law
[42:32] why is he saying that
[42:37] why did he talk about abraham which was
[42:39] way before law
[42:42] and yet he says under the law
[42:47] before he circumcised
[42:49] me
[42:51] rules regulations do's and don'ts things
[42:53] we think we do and think we don't
[42:55] uh i'll remind you i'll get to it later
[42:58] but i remind you as quick as they sinned
[43:00] in the garden
[43:01] they made them some fig leaves
[43:06] but god wouldn't take it
[43:08] all right abraham never received the
[43:10] problems while he was in circumcision
[43:11] under the law but when he was under
[43:13] grace before circumcision was ever
[43:15] issued therefore it's not nothing that
[43:18] we could do to merit it's god's grace
[43:21] that gives it to us by faith abraham
[43:23] believed god and it was imputed to him
[43:25] for righteousness
[43:26] the law is what man wanted
[43:30] not what god wanted
[43:36] okay
[43:41] law is what man wanted
[43:46] no god was going to give him the law
[43:48] show me where he was
[43:53] paul
[43:54] concludes it by saying
[43:57] the law was given because of
[43:59] transgressions
[44:03] is that scripture
[44:05] it was not god's will to give the law
[44:09] yeah but now you're talking about
[44:10] spiritual law now be careful brother
[44:12] because that law is spiritual i agree
[44:14] with you
[44:18] but why do you need law
[44:21] if you have the law giver
[44:24] in your presence
[44:27] right
[44:30] why do you want a book of rules
[44:32] if you got the one who wrote the book
[44:39] they had the prophets
[44:43] they had the sacrifices
[44:45] they had the grace it had to be some
[44:47] kind of a situation
[44:51] look at the next one
[44:54] that was back an early minister brother
[44:56] dale okay let's go in his later ministry
[44:59] let's go to does god ever change his
[45:00] mind about his word 1965 418 evening
[45:04] service
[45:06] paragraph 96
[45:09] god permitted israel to take a law
[45:12] in exodus the 19th chapter when grace
[45:15] had already given them a prophet pill or
[45:17] fire sacrificial lamb a delivering power
[45:20] and they cried out for a law
[45:21] it wasn't god's will
[45:26] what's now
[45:29] but it was injected because man wanted
[45:32] it
[45:34] now read that next verse real careful
[45:40] and he was cursed
[45:43] by the very law
[45:45] did he want it
[45:49] see
[45:50] it's not god's will
[45:54] it was permitted
[45:56] going down reading down through there
[45:57] while i'm talking you'll find him
[45:59] explaining
[46:01] that god will take his permissive will
[46:04] and make it work out for his perfect
[46:06] will
[46:10] because what else could he do when they
[46:12] were out there saying give us something
[46:13] to do
[46:18] i keep emphasizing god i want you to
[46:19] read it because that bored on me for
[46:21] many years
[46:23] you read exodus 19. it doesn't even look
[46:26] similar to what brother branham is
[46:28] explaining it but we've got to believe
[46:29] what he says
[46:31] or else you the prophet let's believe
[46:33] you
[46:39] see that's what that spirit is trying to
[46:40] do
[46:43] it looks like there that they said
[46:45] god said you're this you're this you're
[46:47] this just make sure you don't mess up
[46:49] your okey dokey and they say everything
[46:50] god says to do will too
[46:54] looks very simple don't it
[46:58] but he said it was not god's will to
[47:00] give it to him and said the man was
[47:02] cursed by the very law
[47:05] that he wanted
[47:11] you know the good old baptist used to
[47:13] preach
[47:16] but there was no law until moses came
[47:21] and it wasn't
[47:24] there wasn't any law until moses came
[47:29] well ain't no condemnation where there
[47:31] ain't no law that's paul
[47:32] come on read it
[47:34] where there's no law there's no
[47:36] condemnation
[47:40] but you don't keep on reading
[47:43] where paul said
[47:45] but unto those see before the law
[47:48] they were judged by the he called it
[47:50] similitude of adam's transgression
[47:57] those that sinned before law was brought
[47:59] into being to keep a record
[48:02] was guilty of sin
[48:05] because of the similitude are the acts
[48:08] of adam
[48:09] the doings of adam
[48:13] you never heard people preach like that
[48:14] well they wouldn't know before there was
[48:16] any law
[48:17] there was no sin
[48:20] well i thought that's what he's done in
[48:22] the garden
[48:24] you know
[48:26] i thought that was the problem in heaven
[48:30] but you see there wasn't no record
[48:31] keeper
[48:35] the law is a record keeper that's what
[48:37] it's doing you go down to the law you do
[48:39] it break the law
[48:41] they make a record
[48:45] you get just a little ovidi i remember
[48:47] one brother come here you know he he
[48:49] didn't think too much about them old
[48:51] parking tickets he just
[48:53] you know
[48:54] ain't got time to fool going down there
[48:56] well one day they pulled him over going
[48:58] in front of the hospital and
[49:00] he wound up jail for about three months
[49:06] called the parking tickets
[49:09] he really thought he's smart with it
[49:11] i mean two bucks a parking ticket or
[49:12] something you know
[49:13] paid 30 all my i think it was 90 i went
[49:15] to see him while he's in jail i won't
[49:16] call his name but
[49:19] i've done everything trying to help him
[49:20] get it out and there just wasn't nothing
[49:21] you could do
[49:24] why because he had a whole bunch of
[49:25] parking things he wouldn't go pay him
[49:26] the law had a right to keep him there
[49:30] the law was just a record keeper
[49:34] see before the law came into being
[49:37] man was judged by the consciousness of
[49:39] the man
[49:42] and that's what we've always been judged
[49:43] by
[49:45] when the law came it didn't change that
[49:49] that's what i want you to see
[49:51] the children of israel wanted the law
[49:54] god knew they wanted law
[49:58] so he gave it to him man
[50:02] even though it looks like it was
[50:04] he just went down and gave it to him
[50:07] you mean you're telling me that brother
[50:08] dale that the law was a word of god but
[50:10] god wasn't intended to give it
[50:15] not that way
[50:20] not that way
[50:23] what do you mean by
[50:24] that i mean there already was grace
[50:27] standing there
[50:29] why would they not want it that way
[50:38] that's when i say it's hard to preach
[50:40] truth
[50:41] why wouldn't why would anybody i'm
[50:43] talking to you and me this is plain
[50:46] why would we want some kind of rules or
[50:48] regulations or something or why would we
[50:50] look down on everybody else you know
[50:52] that's the way you do come on
[50:56] you go around looking at people
[51:03] i see
[51:05] they're not lined up to the word
[51:12] right
[51:15] just remember one thing one scripture
[51:17] that's always built with me
[51:20] whatever condemnation i pass out
[51:25] will be meted back to me according to
[51:27] the scriptures
[51:31] well don't you believe in people
[51:33] dressing right no i believe in people
[51:34] getting born again any well-dressed
[51:36] right
[51:36] if they ain't dressed right they ain't
[51:37] born again
[51:40] is that simple
[51:44] how many people in your steals and lies
[51:47] and cheats and
[51:52] come on
[51:55] well no i'm a christian well
[51:58] i thought that's what the whole bible
[52:00] was to be
[52:03] but you see law was never
[52:06] to bend god's will
[52:12] if it'd walk right on down through there
[52:16] it'd come right straight to jesus christ
[52:22] but no
[52:24] god knew i'm keep emphasizing that point
[52:27] where you'll get it
[52:28] god knew what they wanted
[52:32] even better than their own wordings of
[52:34] what they wanted
[52:35] amen
[52:36] their wordings sound good we'll do what
[52:38] god says to do don't you think that's a
[52:40] good statement to make
[52:42] wouldn't that be a good pledge for
[52:43] anybody to make whatever god wants me to
[52:45] do i'll do it
[52:48] but if god knows your heart why you're
[52:50] saying that
[52:54] he knew they weren't going to keep no
[52:55] law
[52:57] well how do you know by his
[52:58] foreknowledge he could look down and see
[53:00] what they done the next day the day
[53:02] after
[53:08] you know really my definition of
[53:10] legalistic things is
[53:12] probably a funny one but
[53:17] you know we're all trying to justify
[53:19] ourselves in some way
[53:22] that's what gets people called is
[53:23] because
[53:24] you know it's hard to go out and kill
[53:25] somebody and just not tell nobody
[53:29] you keep your mouth shut you never would
[53:30] be able to solve the crime
[53:33] what do you do you go talk to somebody
[53:35] why because you just don't want to be by
[53:36] yourself
[53:40] and you don't go down before the judge
[53:42] and say judge i'd like to tell you a
[53:43] little secret i killed a man the other
[53:45] day
[53:46] no no you don't do that you'll pick a
[53:48] buddy someone close to you that kind of
[53:51] sympathizes with you
[53:52] because you want somebody to sympathize
[53:54] with you
[53:55] well you know and after a while they
[53:57] said
[53:58] well you know i gotta right kill that
[54:00] feller
[54:04] they've not done what they done
[54:07] i know i run that guy off the road
[54:10] but it was his problem being on the road
[54:16] see we can always justify
[54:21] and that's what we try to do
[54:24] but see who was that now the question is
[54:26] asked here
[54:28] who was that
[54:33] of israel
[54:38] that would won't
[54:41] may i illustrate it
[54:44] but donny's got an away model i guess he
[54:46] still got it but
[54:48] and it runs it's good
[54:51] and they're good to set up in the barn
[54:52] and look at
[54:55] but you don't want to go across country
[54:58] right
[55:00] i mean you just don't want to go across
[55:02] country with them
[55:04] they're good to look at they're good
[55:05] shiny fine little toys that's good but
[55:07] you know
[55:10] i'd probably pick a bicycle if i had to
[55:12] go from here to california
[55:14] i'd probably pick the bicycle over the a
[55:16] model but i figured i'd make it quicker
[55:19] that are going to be working on a lot
[55:21] well what are you talking about
[55:23] i'm talking about choices we make
[55:29] why would israel choose law
[55:34] instead of grace
[55:41] why would eve
[55:44] commit adultery with an animal
[55:54] it must have been some other
[55:56] outside influence motivating
[56:02] as i said in israel
[56:05] they chose law
[56:08] the next step was they chose a king
[56:18] the next step they chose satan
[56:21] you want to quote brother around them
[56:24] he said when
[56:25] they rejected jesus
[56:28] and freed barabbas
[56:30] said that put satan
[56:32] to his highest apex
[56:35] of his being
[56:37] exalted him
[56:39] need that quote
[56:45] you see the same one that caused eve the
[56:48] problem in the garden
[56:52] was the same one that was in the people
[56:55] wanting them to choose law
[57:04] it was the same one it was in the people
[57:06] that wanted them to choose a king
[57:12] the same one that was in the
[57:15] children of israel that chose to parabus
[57:17] to be freed
[57:18] and crucify jesus
[57:26] the same one that's wanting you and i to
[57:28] think that we got something to do in our
[57:29] salvation
[57:38] even your prophet
[57:41] you remember when he shot
[57:43] he said only thing i can say was that
[57:46] i didn't commit adultery
[57:55] you see you go talk to people and
[57:56] they're dying or something they'll
[57:58] they'll try to pin it onto something
[58:05] but i've never done that
[58:09] i never done the things that
[58:11] that them other people done
[58:20] but where does that make me of any value
[58:23] or a thought
[58:27] see they chose law
[58:30] instead of grace we're going to read a
[58:31] good bit in a minute on that
[58:36] in other words
[58:40] wouldn't it not be that they chose law
[58:42] thinking
[58:43] it was grace
[58:48] they thought that was god's will for
[58:49] their life
[58:51] to have a book of rules
[58:56] now as i said about the a model
[58:58] illustrating it see
[59:04] you got a prophet that can tell you
[59:09] all your problems and troubles to
[59:10] straighten everything out
[59:13] you got a sacrifice that was made
[59:16] for you
[59:22] you got an unconditional covenant
[59:27] the unconditional covenant came to
[59:29] abraham before the law ever came into
[59:31] being
[59:33] right
[59:34] i mean in the scripture
[59:37] it's genesis about 15 unconditional
[59:40] covenant you've got to get on over into
[59:42] exodus and things before you get to the
[59:44] law numbers
[59:48] what about having all of that and saying
[59:51] but we want something to do
[59:58] give us something to do
[1:00:09] what are we thinking about what we do
[1:00:11] and don't do
[1:00:13] well i ain't like that other person
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:20] i kind of remember
[1:00:22] the story behind that
[1:00:24] was it not two people praying
[1:00:28] and one of them
[1:00:29] said i haven't done this and done that
[1:00:33] and i haven't been like him
[1:00:42] yet the bible said
[1:00:43] the old sinner just wept and said father
[1:00:45] forgive me
[1:00:47] he said now who went home justified
[1:00:53] oh when that guy walked out of the
[1:00:54] building and wanted to pray for everyone
[1:00:56] but let's go and i prayed my prayer i
[1:00:58] prayed my prayer one and i went through
[1:00:59] my prayer and in my prayer i said i'm
[1:01:01] not like him and i thank god i'm not
[1:01:03] like him
[1:01:08] probably wound up in hell
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:16] yet he sure didn't think he's going
[1:01:19] you know brother ryan said the one
[1:01:20] that's going to be the problem when you
[1:01:21] get to the white throne judgment is the
[1:01:23] preachers
[1:01:26] say have not i done this and have not
[1:01:27] i've done that happen to all this thing
[1:01:31] they said depart from me i never knew
[1:01:33] you
[1:01:37] listen to a few quotes let's read some
[1:01:38] all right
[1:01:39] go ahead with number five brother
[1:01:43] let's just read some of the things we
[1:01:45] bypass number four
[1:01:47] where they wanted the king and brother
[1:01:48] brown said when they accepted saul
[1:01:51] as their king they denied god as their
[1:01:53] king
[1:01:55] that's where
[1:01:56] where has thy
[1:01:57] strength gone samson 1959-702
[1:02:04] they wanted a king and and when they
[1:02:06] accepted saul as their king they denied
[1:02:08] god as their king
[1:02:10] and when we accept denominational
[1:02:12] barriers and handshakes and classical
[1:02:14] things instead of the holy spirit then
[1:02:16] we're denying god our king
[1:02:19] okay
[1:02:20] now look
[1:02:22] the sumerian church age
[1:02:24] prison 1960 1206
[1:02:28] trying to cut down
[1:02:31] i stood upon the bank and had a
[1:02:33] pentecostal meeting they did but listen
[1:02:35] moses sang in the spirit miriam took a
[1:02:37] tambourine and ran down the bank beating
[1:02:39] this time of rain and dancing in the
[1:02:41] spirit and the daughters of israel
[1:02:43] followed her dancing in the spirit if
[1:02:45] that ain't a pentecostal meeting i never
[1:02:48] seen one
[1:02:49] little did they believe
[1:02:51] that the the promised land was 40 years
[1:02:54] ahead of them it was only about
[1:02:57] 40 miles
[1:03:00] but it take them 40 years to get 40
[1:03:03] miles is because they chose the wrong
[1:03:05] thing
[1:03:08] they chose to have a law instead of the
[1:03:11] letting of instead of letting the holy
[1:03:13] spirit lead them
[1:03:15] the filler pillar fire to take them on
[1:03:17] through and lead them they wanted to
[1:03:19] have something to do themselves they
[1:03:22] wanted to have certain priests
[1:03:24] and certain dignities and a little
[1:03:26] theology they could fuss about instead
[1:03:29] of just going on and letting the holy
[1:03:30] spirit lead them
[1:03:33] they were in the spirit god had provided
[1:03:35] everything
[1:03:36] but they had have something to do into
[1:03:38] it
[1:03:40] something to do
[1:03:44] what is it that we have
[1:03:47] something to do
[1:03:52] i've told you this and i try to do it as
[1:03:53] an illustration
[1:03:56] a lot of people jump up run into the
[1:03:58] message and say i've i know i got the
[1:04:00] holy ghost because i came in the message
[1:04:02] when i came in the message i saw
[1:04:04] immediately i did not have the baptism
[1:04:06] of the holy ghost
[1:04:07] yet i was a deacon in a baptist church
[1:04:09] at 23 years of age
[1:04:12] i was teaching adult sunday school
[1:04:14] classes when i left the church
[1:04:18] but yet when the prophet started talking
[1:04:19] about the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:04:21] the person of jesus christ i knew i
[1:04:24] didn't have it
[1:04:26] and for two years i sought it
[1:04:31] reading
[1:04:34] praying
[1:04:36] everything i could do
[1:04:38] to try to find god
[1:04:46] you see that's the problem with people
[1:04:47] they don't understand
[1:04:49] why paul would say that he was the
[1:04:50] chiefest of sinners
[1:04:55] because he didn't do what people had
[1:04:56] done
[1:04:58] people that have done things can repent
[1:05:00] of what they do and they feel good about
[1:05:02] it
[1:05:03] but what about people that hadn't done
[1:05:04] things
[1:05:09] becomes a very religious society
[1:05:12] within yourself
[1:05:15] it's harder for a
[1:05:17] good man to be saved than it is for a
[1:05:18] bad one
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:24] you may not believe that but that's all
[1:05:26] right
[1:05:31] look what they've done
[1:05:33] god has a provided way number six
[1:05:36] e62
[1:05:38] i mean e-72
[1:05:41] little did they know then when did they
[1:05:45] there was only about 10 days from the
[1:05:47] promised land
[1:05:49] knowing that they were 40 years away
[1:05:51] from it
[1:05:52] why
[1:05:53] because they refused to follow god
[1:05:57] they wanted a law instead of grace
[1:06:00] and they got it
[1:06:01] so they couldn't make their own way so
[1:06:05] that they could make their own way
[1:06:07] and have their own so and so man's
[1:06:09] always tried to do something by himself
[1:06:12] and god let every one of them perish in
[1:06:14] the wilderness and raised up a new
[1:06:16] generation and took them to the promised
[1:06:18] land
[1:06:21] what are we doing
[1:06:24] look at number seven return in jubilee
[1:06:26] i'll try to scan through this because
[1:06:28] this is a long reading
[1:06:29] we're going from paragraph
[1:06:31] e46 to 50 i guess
[1:06:36] and little did they know
[1:06:39] raise this one up brother
[1:06:42] they were dancing in this dancing on the
[1:06:44] banks of the jordan there on the dead
[1:06:46] sea that they were 40 years away from
[1:06:49] the land
[1:06:50] little did they know
[1:06:52] there was only about five days away
[1:06:55] and they made their rash ratio
[1:06:59] mistake in exodus the 19th chapter where
[1:07:02] they accepted law instead of grace
[1:07:04] where they turned down god's way
[1:07:07] to have a way for themselves give us
[1:07:09] something to do
[1:07:11] that's been man's idea all along
[1:07:15] well that's not my idea
[1:07:22] first with the prophet
[1:07:30] now remember it's been man's ideal
[1:07:34] that's the nature of man
[1:07:37] what save yourself
[1:07:39] adam expressed that in the garden of
[1:07:41] eden when he was lost instead of going
[1:07:43] back to god for grace he tried to make
[1:07:44] himself an apron
[1:07:46] and ever since then he's tried to have
[1:07:47] something to do with redemption
[1:07:50] when redemption is a free offer of the
[1:07:53] of grace by god god alone
[1:07:56] there's nothing you can do to save
[1:07:58] yourself god saves you no way at all you
[1:08:01] can do but man wants something to do
[1:08:03] into it
[1:08:08] man wants something to do to save
[1:08:10] yourself
[1:08:14] i've always said if it was told
[1:08:18] to go stand on your head
[1:08:20] and pay a ten thousand dollar fine
[1:08:23] you'd become a christian
[1:08:27] the churches would be slapped full that
[1:08:29] day
[1:08:31] might not be out of the end but that day
[1:08:32] they'd be there to make sure they go
[1:08:34] through that ritual
[1:08:36] because that's what churches do right
[1:08:41] a good old brother
[1:08:43] he's a member in good standing
[1:08:49] i'm not throwing off on him just making
[1:08:51] a point the
[1:08:52] preacher preached it my brother-in-law
[1:08:54] was raising tomatoes up in heaven
[1:08:57] because god needed somebody to raise
[1:08:58] tomatoes and he was good at it
[1:09:01] you know
[1:09:02] well i hope he's there
[1:09:05] i wouldn't tell nobody if they're lost
[1:09:07] and not going that's not the right thing
[1:09:09] to do either
[1:09:12] i've had to preach funerals that i
[1:09:13] didn't know about people you know what i
[1:09:14] preach about like brother branham said
[1:09:21] he said preach to the people
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:27] you notice i'm not too straight about
[1:09:29] what's going on i preach to the people
[1:09:32] if i understand somebody i'll try to do
[1:09:33] the best i can but
[1:09:38] he said mankind
[1:09:40] today don't want the leadership
[1:09:44] or the church don't that god has
[1:09:46] provided they try to think of some other
[1:09:48] way they go to seminaries educate their
[1:09:50] men come out with a theological
[1:09:53] experience
[1:09:55] that's off that same message
[1:09:59] paragraph 50 on it e50 yes sir they made
[1:10:02] a rational mistake when they did that
[1:10:05] they wondered
[1:10:07] for 40 years that's exactly what they'd
[1:10:09] done
[1:10:10] they wondered for 40 years when there
[1:10:12] wasn't over five days from the promised
[1:10:14] land it's about 40 miles from the red
[1:10:16] city where they went
[1:10:17] they could have walked in three or four
[1:10:20] days and been in the promised land but
[1:10:22] they made their own choice
[1:10:25] now you understand
[1:10:27] what i'm trying to get out
[1:10:29] you may not read revel
[1:10:32] exodus 19
[1:10:33] and see it clearly but read it and see
[1:10:35] it clearly of this
[1:10:37] god knew what they wanted
[1:10:41] and he gave it to him
[1:10:46] he knew what they wanted in their heart
[1:10:52] god the prophet said god will give you
[1:10:55] the desire of your heart
[1:11:01] they chose law
[1:11:03] grace had furnished them a lamb
[1:11:06] i'm just going on down to skin and so
[1:11:08] moses was a prophet grace provided
[1:11:10] everything they had need of but they
[1:11:12] wanted something to do themselves
[1:11:17] wanted something to do themselves
[1:11:20] that's exactly what pentecost did when
[1:11:22] god revealed some new thing something in
[1:11:25] the scripture
[1:11:26] instead they call it new issues or
[1:11:28] whatever they want to do about it
[1:11:30] but when god revealed something instead
[1:11:32] of accepting truth
[1:11:35] and test it with the bible
[1:11:38] this is from the message oh lord just
[1:11:40] once more verses 63 6 28.
[1:11:46] instead of accepting the truth and test
[1:11:48] it in the with the bible they pulled out
[1:11:50] and made an organization separated
[1:11:52] himself and then along
[1:11:55] come this and the other
[1:11:59] and now you stand
[1:12:02] you won't be correct
[1:12:04] you're corrupted
[1:12:11] go to number nine
[1:12:15] this is a message paradox 1965.
[1:12:22] if you'll notice then their journey in
[1:12:24] the wilderness
[1:12:25] is where they're got their greatest
[1:12:27] mistake that israel ever made until
[1:12:29] calvary
[1:12:30] was when in exodus 19 they accepted the
[1:12:33] law instead of grace they had grace they
[1:12:35] had a prophet
[1:12:37] they had a sacrificial lamb they had
[1:12:38] redemption they had been brought through
[1:12:40] the red sea they had been healed of
[1:12:42] their diseases they had water from a
[1:12:44] smitten rock
[1:12:46] they had manna out of heaven everything
[1:12:48] had they had need of had been supplied
[1:12:51] and still they wanted something else
[1:13:01] they wanted to be like the rest of them
[1:13:07] how much more do we need
[1:13:11] he said well brother dale don't you want
[1:13:13] us to do anything a paradox
[1:13:16] paragraph 71
[1:13:20] now that's where people think today of
[1:13:21] divine healing or something any other
[1:13:24] work of grace
[1:13:25] that there is something that you
[1:13:28] have to do
[1:13:30] you there is nothing you have to do
[1:13:34] but believe
[1:13:37] just believe god
[1:13:39] then the next one what did he say
[1:13:42] you do have something to do on down in
[1:13:44] the message a little
[1:13:47] into it that's your surrender of your
[1:13:50] own will
[1:13:51] to the will and idea of almighty god
[1:13:53] that's finished
[1:13:55] take his promise don't think nothing
[1:13:57] about it just keep moving
[1:13:59] trying to get down to the last one
[1:14:03] number 11 let's get it
[1:14:06] oh excuse me let's go on to number 10
[1:14:08] on the paradox paragraph 76. there you
[1:14:11] go they wanted the law and all god
[1:14:14] always gives you the desire of your
[1:14:15] heart he promised to but we find out
[1:14:17] when they turn one step from the side of
[1:14:20] what god had reasonably promised then
[1:14:22] that was a thorn in the flesh until the
[1:14:24] law was taken away until jesus christ
[1:14:26] came and was crucified
[1:14:29] always gives you the desire of your
[1:14:31] heart
[1:14:34] so if you want a book of rules he'll
[1:14:36] give it to you
[1:14:39] look at the lies when hear him preach in
[1:14:41] 1962
[1:14:42] 7-11 number number 11.
[1:14:50] let's see
[1:14:53] see they made their mistake
[1:14:55] i'm having to find where it's at
[1:14:57] so i got 79
[1:15:01] rolled it up
[1:15:04] all right
[1:15:07] yep right in here
[1:15:09] okay but you see where they made their
[1:15:11] rational mistake was exodus 19 when they
[1:15:13] got away from grace that god had already
[1:15:16] provided for them and got them a prophet
[1:15:20] and a pillar of fire and a sacrificial
[1:15:21] lamb and doing signs and wonders grace
[1:15:24] had provided that but they wanted
[1:15:26] something to do themselves they had to
[1:15:28] have something to make themselves
[1:15:30] doctors of divinity
[1:15:33] so
[1:15:34] they wanted a law
[1:15:36] and theirs where they died
[1:15:41] no
[1:15:42] that was the last statement i wanted to
[1:15:44] get to
[1:15:45] the prophet said there's where they died
[1:15:50] when they wanted law
[1:15:54] you know brother dale we're not wanting
[1:15:56] to be under law
[1:16:00] why do we judge everybody else by our
[1:16:02] own
[1:16:04] book of rules
[1:16:14] like always gets me as a lot you know
[1:16:16] that people will say i don't understand
[1:16:18] how come brothers sisters so-and-so
[1:16:19] didn't see it i saw it immediately
[1:16:23] and i'm the pastor that's been around
[1:16:25] here all these years
[1:16:27] know that it took me four or five years
[1:16:29] to get some of you even thinking correct
[1:16:31] on
[1:16:32] those things
[1:16:34] but yet you saw it immediately
[1:16:38] sister gayle's one on the one in the
[1:16:40] building secondary and said i didn't
[1:16:46] you see church
[1:16:50] we can have a book of rules and call it
[1:16:52] grace
[1:16:54] my point what
[1:16:56] they chose law instead of grace
[1:16:59] they chose law thinking that was god's
[1:17:03] will for their lives
[1:17:07] yet the prophet said it was not god's
[1:17:09] will to give the law
[1:17:16] then we'll get to it this evening what
[1:17:17] is the law given for then
[1:17:20] as a schoolmaster
[1:17:24] it's got its reason see god turned
[1:17:26] around and took it
[1:17:27] they chose it
[1:17:29] god gave it
[1:17:31] but he gave them
[1:17:33] himself in a letter form
[1:17:39] what do we got
[1:17:41] i believe the message brother dale i
[1:17:43] believe everything the prophet said amen
[1:17:47] i remember and we'll get to him this
[1:17:49] evening and somebody
[1:17:51] man seemed like during the bible said
[1:17:52] one time said have you received the gift
[1:17:54] of the holy ghost since you believe
[1:18:01] that's what i say to you and i how we
[1:18:02] receive the holy ghost since we believe
[1:18:06] well i come in the message that's
[1:18:07] reading i know i'm born again
[1:18:15] what is your evidence
[1:18:22] what is your evidence of the holy ghost
[1:18:31] whether you want to believe it or not we
[1:18:32] all have it
[1:18:35] and that's the point of driving down
[1:18:36] hard to get us to see because we can't
[1:18:38] get if we can't get this driven down
[1:18:40] hard enough to see then we'll never know
[1:18:42] what in the world a new birth is
[1:18:50] because a new birth to most people is
[1:18:51] just
[1:18:53] live in a book of rules
[1:18:59] right leaving a book of rooms
[1:19:04] but what is the new birth
[1:19:09] you realize what i'm talking about if
[1:19:11] they'd kept right on walking and not
[1:19:13] accepted law
[1:19:14] one one time he said five days by the
[1:19:16] time he said ten days that's just a man
[1:19:18] talking right
[1:19:19] that's not mistakes
[1:19:26] ten days or something they would have
[1:19:27] been in the promised land
[1:19:32] you realize how quickly they struck that
[1:19:34] promised land if they could have
[1:19:35] believed it jesus christ would have come
[1:19:37] on the scene
[1:19:45] because it was lost they needed a savior
[1:19:47] but if they had just accepted it went on
[1:19:49] he'd have met him right there in the
[1:19:50] promised land
[1:19:57] of course you and i wouldn't been
[1:19:58] involved in all this
[1:20:01] you know what i'm glad they did
[1:20:05] i'm glad they went the way they went
[1:20:07] from you and i
[1:20:08] oh we wouldn't be here
[1:20:11] but now what are we going to do with
[1:20:12] come on brothers
[1:20:13] what are we going to do with it
[1:20:15] what they wanted that's the question or
[1:20:17] the thought that i put out today
[1:20:20] they got what they wanted
[1:20:24] and it killed them
[1:20:29] they died
[1:20:35] but they died believing is right
[1:20:46] when are we going to get to the point to
[1:20:47] where that we
[1:20:48] will accept what god has to say unto us
[1:20:53] and accept it as grace
[1:20:59] i've heard sermons preached that a
[1:21:00] prophet is law
[1:21:02] that's right he is
[1:21:04] but then why don't they preach that he's
[1:21:05] grace too
[1:21:11] amen he's grace
[1:21:14] why did they need a king to lead them
[1:21:20] they're going to start bowing down
[1:21:21] before him
[1:21:22] that's what satan wanted
[1:21:25] if you understand what i've tried to
[1:21:27] drive you especially wednesday night and
[1:21:29] this morning
[1:21:30] that there is a reason why israel chose
[1:21:33] law
[1:21:35] it was the devil in them
[1:21:40] that they thought it was god in them
[1:21:49] it's not the devil didn't bring the law
[1:21:52] you don't you misunderstand me
[1:21:56] devil caused them to
[1:21:58] want it
[1:22:02] by doing that it proved it and they died
[1:22:04] it cursed them the very thing that they
[1:22:06] thought was deliverance was cursed them
[1:22:08] paul said what i thought was life i
[1:22:10] found to be death
[1:22:17] but you know it's so hard to get away
[1:22:18] with brother you're just not leaving
[1:22:20] anything that we can depend upon to say
[1:22:22] i'm saved because i didn't do or done it
[1:22:24] it didn't it did what you know
[1:22:31] what do we need a reason or thing we're
[1:22:33] not believing god let's stand
[1:22:35] well not believe what he says
[1:22:39] there is no grace outside of believing
[1:22:42] god's word
[1:22:48] there is no salvation in the book of
[1:22:50] rules
[1:22:53] you can't make yourself good enough to
[1:22:55] be saved if you could jesus christ died
[1:22:56] in vain
[1:22:58] come on folks
[1:23:00] so let's accept what he done for us okay
[1:23:02] what are we covering
[1:23:05] 6 12 anybody have a need
[1:23:28] don't want to ask the lord
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:58] are me and you are
[1:24:01] my brother even though
[1:24:40] lord jesus
[1:24:42] our little sister she wants us to pray
[1:24:45] for her family
[1:24:47] lord what a great thing
[1:24:50] you just keep that desire in your heart
[1:24:52] lord
[1:24:53] and then you move on to sin
[1:24:56] and you just manifest yourself through
[1:24:58] the family and let her look sister see
[1:25:00] that desire that
[1:25:02] she has
[1:25:04] to see you moving in their lives
[1:25:06] we believe you father because she
[1:25:08] believes you
[1:25:10] and we thank you in jesus name
[1:25:14] anybody else
[1:25:42] so let's believe
[1:25:44] believe in a god that can take care of
[1:25:46] all things

[1:25:49] in the name of jesus christ we send this
[1:25:51] prayer cloth

[1:25:55] concern his heart for her
