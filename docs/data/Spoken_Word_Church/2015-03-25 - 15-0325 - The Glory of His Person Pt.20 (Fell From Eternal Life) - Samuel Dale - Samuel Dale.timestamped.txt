[4:02] 1
[4:03] 12.
[4:05] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[4:07] with me and being turned i saw seven
[4:09] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[4:12] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[4:14] son of man
[4:15] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[4:19] and gird about the paps with a golden
[4:21] girdle now we go over to genesis
[4:24] jumping from genesis
[4:26] from revelations on the way back to
[4:29] genesis all right
[4:30] genesis 2
[4:32] we'll start reading seven through nine
[4:34] and then we'll skip and jump over to
[4:37] uh verse 17 and then we'll go on to the
[4:41] uh
[4:42] chapter 3.
[4:44] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[4:46] of the ground and breathed into his
[4:48] nostrils the breath of life and man
[4:50] became a living soul
[4:53] and the lord god planted a garden
[4:54] eastward in eden there he put the man
[4:56] whom he had formed and out of the ground
[4:58] may the lord
[5:00] god to grow every tree that is pleasant
[5:02] to the eye and good for for food the
[5:05] tree of life also in the midst of the
[5:07] garden and the tree of knowledge of good
[5:09] and evil now jump just over to verse
[5:12] 17 and says
[5:14] you know that they could eat of every
[5:15] tree verse 16
[5:17] you know and all i can but what but of
[5:19] the tree of knowledge
[5:21] of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
[5:23] it for in the day that thou eat us
[5:26] thereof thy shall surely
[5:28] die now then we go over to
[5:31] chapter
[5:33] three
[5:35] and the serpent was more subtle than any
[5:37] beast of the field which the lord god
[5:39] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[5:42] hath god said ye shall not eat of ever
[5:44] tree of the garden the woman said unto
[5:47] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[5:49] the trees of the garden
[5:51] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[5:52] the midst of the garden god has said you
[5:55] shall not
[5:56] eat of it let neither shall you touch it
[5:59] lest you die for god know it that in the
[6:01] day you eat thereof even your eyes shall
[6:04] be opened
[6:06] excuse me therefore your eyes shall be
[6:08] opened and ye shall be as god's knowing
[6:10] good
[6:11] and evil
[6:12] and the woman when the woman saw that
[6:15] the tree was good for food and that it
[6:17] was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to
[6:19] be desired to make one wise
[6:21] she took the fruit thereof and did eat
[6:24] and gave someone to her husband with her
[6:26] and he did eat
[6:27] and the eyes of them both were open and
[6:30] they knew that they were naked and they
[6:31] sowed fig leaves together and made them
[6:34] aprons now then you go on to the rest of
[6:36] it we won't get into the rest of that
[6:39] part tonight so we'll just do that so
[6:41] you may be seated the lord add his
[6:43] blessing
[6:44] to the reading of the word
[6:46] now
[6:47] we have
[6:49] been dealing with the
[6:52] what we call the fall the doings the
[6:55] the uh life we've dealt with bringing
[6:59] into being you know mankind and the uh
[7:03] the things that has to be and all like
[7:06] that and now we're getting to the point
[7:08] of talking about and how for the past
[7:11] two or three services
[7:13] about what happened in the garden and
[7:17] we know that
[7:18] uh
[7:20] mankind are a person
[7:24] you know it says he breathed into the
[7:26] nostrils of adam and he became a living
[7:28] soul all right
[7:30] then we know that mankind according to
[7:34] uh james 2 and 26
[7:37] says he's or excuse me first
[7:39] thessalonians 5 and 23
[7:41] it speaks of spirit body and soul
[7:44] and knowing that man is a triune being
[7:47] you know
[7:48] of the body of the spirit and the soul
[7:50] all right
[7:51] but then we've tried to cover that
[7:54] what happened in the garden was
[7:56] the fact of
[7:58] you know the unbelief that came into the
[8:01] mind of eve
[8:03] to where the things would take place
[8:06] later and most everybody deals with the
[8:09] the things that took place but
[8:12] yet we're trying to deal with it as a
[8:14] lineup to get to the position because
[8:18] what took place is an attribute
[8:21] it's just like uh that you know smoking
[8:24] drinking gambling things is not
[8:26] uh sin that's an attribute of unbelief
[8:29] it it's just you know
[8:31] it's just something that's displayed
[8:34] all right so then we know and we've
[8:36] tried to cover and trying to get to a
[8:38] point of talking about us in that triune
[8:42] being
[8:43] and looking back directly we're trying
[8:45] to be in you've got a body which has see
[8:47] taste field smelling here you have a
[8:50] second realm of you that we'll cover it
[8:52] in a minute that when you're talking
[8:53] about the spirit it's got memory reason
[8:56] conscious affections etc
[8:58] in it and then the the center realm of
[9:01] mankind
[9:02] it has only one sense it's either faith
[9:05] or doubt one of them is controlling us
[9:08] and in charge
[9:09] all right and taking those
[9:12] realms
[9:13] we want and have tried to cover
[9:16] how that like it says about eve in
[9:19] thessalonians there that you know that
[9:22] uh lest you be deceived i believe it
[9:25] dawson corinthians yeah i got it written
[9:27] down but anyhow
[9:28] through
[9:29] satan and his septility
[9:32] all right
[9:34] then
[9:35] talking about
[9:37] mankind to see what took place
[9:40] i'm trying to approach it from the
[9:42] position to where that we
[9:45] can see
[9:46] what took place back there
[9:49] all right
[9:50] and not to just read
[9:53] or to think about
[9:55] but to try to break it down into
[9:59] our rim today
[10:02] and think about a body a spirit soul of
[10:06] mankind
[10:07] all right then the body without the
[10:10] spirit according to james two
[10:13] is dead
[10:14] so we can annihilate that part of the
[10:16] body and leaving it to where that the
[10:18] body only displays
[10:21] the uh unbelief you know the things and
[10:24] that would be the attribute
[10:26] that would be what would be bothering
[10:28] you is the attribute part all right and
[10:31] we you know and most everybody deals
[10:33] with just that
[10:35] part
[10:36] without thinking about what caused eve
[10:39] to do wrong
[10:41] and then in what
[10:42] position or what thought
[10:44] it was that you know that she would do
[10:48] uh as she done
[10:50] and i tried to get you from one thing to
[10:53] keep in mind
[10:54] this point
[10:56] whatever happened to eve and adam in the
[10:59] garden
[11:01] has been happening to mankind
[11:04] all the way from that time
[11:07] all right
[11:09] you know from that day that that started
[11:12] it set into motion uh the problems that
[11:15] we have in life the the death the sorrow
[11:18] the heartaches the troubles all came
[11:21] because
[11:22] of mankind and what he done back there
[11:25] when he disbelieved god and and went
[11:27] after his own ideas all right and see
[11:30] then if we look at that and it said we
[11:32] see eve and what happened with her
[11:35] we can see what's happening to us
[11:39] or if we see what's happening to us
[11:42] we can see what happened to her
[11:44] all right because that'll bring it all
[11:46] out in the open and we won't have to be
[11:49] uh wondering you know or or trying to
[11:52] uh figure out
[11:54] and just say well it was just this it
[11:56] was just unbelief
[11:57] well that's true now it was unbelief but
[12:00] unbelief had a display an attribute all
[12:02] right so we know that you know and we
[12:05] know that's what caused the problems
[12:07] back there but we don't blame adam and
[12:09] eve for our problems right
[12:13] since you and i are free moral agents
[12:15] just as well as adam and eve were placed
[12:18] there as free moral agents to choose
[12:21] all right and then when they chose wrong
[12:24] see that's where things went wrong well
[12:26] we don't blame them because of us being
[12:28] wrong
[12:30] because once we reach the age of
[12:32] accountability
[12:33] and we start in our own selves we start
[12:36] thinking reasonings and and things
[12:39] starts working
[12:41] and then out through the human parts of
[12:44] us the body and things starts displaying
[12:47] those things as we begin to develop
[12:50] all right and seeing it then knowing
[12:53] that
[12:54] what happens it says to say to eve
[12:57] is the same thing that's happening to
[12:59] you and i'm sorry
[13:01] but yet if we get so super religious so
[13:04] uh greatly live being something you know
[13:07] well of course we don't think there's
[13:08] anything wrong with us
[13:11] you know we think that we're oh
[13:13] nothing's wrong with me i'm a christian
[13:17] well that's why i cover the things the
[13:19] way i do
[13:21] and how thank god that we
[13:23] have had a prophet
[13:25] that we at least claim
[13:27] to be the one that uh brought the word
[13:30] to us and and by that then we can at
[13:33] least claim the point of saying well
[13:36] whether i understand it or not
[13:39] i've i i do have an ability now to
[13:44] to place things in the right perspective
[13:47] by god sending us a profit
[13:49] and doing it in that way and that way we
[13:52] we don't have to you know we don't then
[13:54] uh we're not like saying well what's
[13:56] your thoughts
[13:58] you know what do you think happened
[14:01] well i think it was this well that's all
[14:03] right but i think it was this
[14:05] well you can go along all your life
[14:07] trying to figure out what you're
[14:08] thinking about
[14:09] you know your thoughts and ideas
[14:13] but see we at least claim to have the
[14:15] message to bring out those things
[14:18] to where that we can can say this is
[14:21] what it means
[14:22] we might not have known what
[14:25] before but now we have the message to
[14:28] check things with
[14:30] and wonder why and see in doing it then
[14:34] as i keep saying it whatever happened to
[14:37] eve in the garden that's the same thing
[14:39] don't get it just this happen here and
[14:42] then we go away over here and we we
[14:44] don't have no problems you know
[14:46] no whatever happened there
[14:50] whatever started there is still in
[14:52] motion today
[14:54] amen satan desired to
[14:57] enter himself into the human race
[15:00] is that true
[15:01] that was his purpose of causing to fall
[15:04] well he didn't stop because he couldn't
[15:08] achieve it
[15:09] in the way that he desired maybe
[15:12] he's still trying today
[15:15] and today you can see that he has the
[15:17] biggest portion of the religious world
[15:21] under his control
[15:24] into the line of his thinking
[15:27] you know
[15:28] and and in order to show you then it's
[15:30] still here
[15:32] whatever took place there is still here
[15:35] you know
[15:36] because that's that's the point of what
[15:38] we're we've got to look at and not just
[15:39] blame adam and eve and oh we can't help
[15:42] it we're just this away
[15:44] yeah
[15:45] we can blame them all we want to but
[15:47] that won't do any good that's right
[15:49] all right
[15:50] trying to get that thought into our
[15:52] minds
[15:54] well we know the message we do you know
[15:56] the message
[15:58] you know
[16:00] i mean you know do you just
[16:02] is your part of the fall just
[16:05] you know
[16:06] even the beast and something that took
[16:08] place and we were glad we've got that
[16:11] straightened out you know
[16:13] well worth satan today
[16:17] see that would have ended back there
[16:20] but it didn't end back there it just
[16:22] started back there
[16:24] and see now it's the church
[16:27] that he's trying to deceive
[16:29] amen
[16:31] he's already got the center
[16:34] right
[16:35] the sinner's already on the realm of
[16:36] satan or in his domain or you know
[16:39] doings
[16:41] but he's trying his best to conquer the
[16:43] church
[16:44] the bride of jesus christ
[16:47] all right
[16:48] and he has done a good job
[16:52] because as we may quote the prophet is
[16:54] to say
[16:55] that none of us are a match for the
[16:57] devil
[16:59] right i don't care how spiritual you
[17:01] think you are how revelated you think
[17:04] you are
[17:06] that's the words of the prophet he said
[17:08] no person today is a match he said the
[17:11] holy spirit
[17:13] is a match for the devil but not you and
[17:15] i
[17:16] so then we've got to depend on him
[17:19] for the answer
[17:20] not just what we think is right or
[17:23] already is or going on and think that
[17:25] it's doing it and where is it today in
[17:28] the biggest realm
[17:31] does it not speak of
[17:33] satan as him having
[17:35] uh
[17:36] ministers
[17:38] preachers which say
[17:42] all right
[17:43] that are trying their best to deceive
[17:47] well it's always like i like to say it
[17:49] and people don't like for me to just be
[17:51] plain some people has even rebuked me
[17:53] for making blunt statements but
[17:55] you think you're a match for the devil
[17:57] you're already deceived
[18:00] you think you can handle this thing
[18:02] you're already deceived
[18:05] don't worry about getting deceived
[18:07] and like i tell you you know i said well
[18:09] brother dale i was doing pretty good
[18:11] until you started preaching on this and
[18:14] now i'm confused well i didn't confuse
[18:17] you
[18:20] you mean to tell me you don't want the
[18:22] truth
[18:25] see if we're deceived we don't know
[18:28] we're deceived
[18:30] now the bible says adam understood what
[18:32] he was doing
[18:34] all right
[18:36] adam wasn't deceived but eve was
[18:39] deceived
[18:40] now her being deceived
[18:42] she thought she was right
[18:46] right
[18:47] and brought around said
[18:49] that's the way it is today
[18:55] the people still think they're right all
[18:57] right the churches think they're right
[19:00] now you don't you know of any church has
[19:02] got a sign put out in front we're all
[19:04] wrong trying to find truth
[19:06] you ever seen one
[19:08] i've been a long country quite ways and
[19:10] a few foreign countries and i haven't
[19:12] read that sign yet
[19:14] it's always
[19:15] come to us we have the truth
[19:19] you know go up on lake lanier and
[19:21] they'll put up a sign up there says come
[19:23] as you are
[19:25] and they do
[19:27] in their bikinis and everything else
[19:29] they come to church as they are sit on
[19:32] the side of the lake in their boats and
[19:35] listen to the preacher while they slip
[19:37] on their liquor and sort of stuff you
[19:38] know come as you are you know
[19:41] just be a part of us
[19:43] everything's all right have you have you
[19:45] read lately of anybody going to hell
[19:48] there's been a lot of funerals probably
[19:50] priest today and i dare say they
[19:52] probably wouldn't have one of it that
[19:54] the preacher ever said this fellow is
[19:55] going a woman or whatever's going to
[19:57] hell
[19:58] no
[19:59] so that's a pretty big deceiving thing
[20:01] right
[20:04] see that's where paul said
[20:07] let satan tempt you through his
[20:09] septility
[20:10] as he did eve
[20:14] see now where did he enter the rim to
[20:16] talk to eve
[20:18] we tried to cover that last wednesday
[20:20] remember
[20:22] that he looks at her and he's trying to
[20:23] figure some way to enter into the human
[20:26] race in any way he can
[20:28] because he knows he cannot create
[20:32] so when he looks he tries to look her
[20:33] over and try to find a way
[20:36] and he finds eve and adam with eternal
[20:39] life in their soul
[20:42] see that was a lot we didn't know right
[20:44] but that's according to blasphemies
[20:46] nines and we'll read some more in a
[20:47] little bit
[20:49] that they had eternal life in their soul
[20:51] so there was no way satan could enter
[20:53] the soul of adam and eve and be able to
[20:55] deceive them
[20:57] all right
[20:58] so that leaves the realm of the body and
[21:01] the spirit
[21:02] well the body without the spirit is dead
[21:04] so you take that out now you've taken
[21:07] out two realms of mankind
[21:10] and you can only be dealing in the
[21:12] spirit realm
[21:14] the spirit realm is what
[21:17] memory reason conscience and
[21:20] you know affections love and things
[21:23] right right
[21:24] whereas for the body it's see taste
[21:26] field smelling here that just deals with
[21:28] what we're doing out here
[21:29] the soul has only one sense either faith
[21:31] or doubt not two it's not faith and
[21:34] doubt being in there are two souls
[21:36] like the people of the message want to
[21:38] believe that you have two souls you know
[21:41] god give you one the devil give you one
[21:43] well you know i never didn't know where
[21:46] the devil could create
[21:48] i thought that was what we claimed the
[21:50] messenger to be saying
[21:52] but in doing that now
[21:55] we look at
[21:56] the points of man and we find then that
[21:58] there was one place that satan
[22:01] is trying to deal with wednesday night
[22:03] real heavily he found that point of her
[22:07] memory reason now remember she didn't
[22:09] have no memory of something that had
[22:11] taken place
[22:12] so he had to start right there
[22:15] in the realm of that doings you know all
[22:18] right now remember that she didn't have
[22:20] memory reason conscience
[22:22] he had to start dealing with that and no
[22:25] tell how telling how long he dealt with
[22:27] her in them realms before he began to
[22:31] get her to really reason
[22:33] so remember then we're in worse shape
[22:39] right
[22:40] because
[22:42] we're born in that
[22:44] memory reason conscience by the time the
[22:46] child reaches the age of accountability
[22:49] it already has its own memory reason
[22:51] conscious affections and things dealing
[22:53] within that body of that person
[22:57] so where is it that mankind where is it
[23:00] that adam and eve sinned at
[23:02] not in soul not in body amen but in
[23:06] their spirit realm
[23:08] all right
[23:09] then the effects came out into the body
[23:13] yeah
[23:14] that's the attribute that's the display
[23:17] it came on out into the body
[23:20] but they still had the eternal life
[23:23] in their soul
[23:25] all right
[23:27] now see that's where i said we didn't
[23:28] know it and people on the internet don't
[23:30] know it but on blasphemy i don't i don't
[23:32] say that don't know it
[23:34] most of them don't know okay
[23:37] because they don't read they don't study
[23:39] they don't listen to the prophet's
[23:40] message
[23:42] they just read what they want to read
[23:43] and skip over the rest of it
[23:46] but brother brown emphatically states in
[23:48] blasphemous names that god breathed into
[23:51] the nostrils of adam
[23:54] and he became
[23:56] an eternal soul
[23:59] all right
[24:01] then he goes on to say that god
[24:03] specially upon now don't try to run any
[24:06] special if you're doing your computer
[24:07] won't come up foot special
[24:09] s-e-s-e-s-p-e-c-i-a-l-l-y
[24:14] because see i tried that for a long time
[24:16] one day and didn't find that i didn't
[24:17] find it especially
[24:19] you know all right
[24:21] he said but god especially upon adam
[24:24] breathed the breath of eternal life
[24:27] and he became an eternal person
[24:30] with god amen
[24:32] all right
[24:35] now we went through wednesday especially
[24:37] covering that
[24:40] adam was in eve
[24:43] in the spiritual creation
[24:46] so then adam would have been even in
[24:50] excuse me he was in adam in the
[24:51] spiritual creation so then in the
[24:54] physical creation eve would have been in
[24:56] adam in the physical all right
[24:59] now in doing that then
[25:03] we don't try to make a byproduct as what
[25:06] mankind wants to make it is something
[25:08] bad
[25:10] the only thing you find in brother
[25:12] branham and i will to state this fact
[25:14] and let it go the only thing you find
[25:17] brother branham talking about the woman
[25:19] as the difference is the fact of
[25:22] in the dogs and the cats it's for the
[25:24] motherly reproduction
[25:26] whereas the woman it's for anytime she
[25:28] desires now that's all you'll find
[25:31] but it's did god make her that way
[25:35] i mean did he
[25:36] form her
[25:38] with some
[25:40] inability or some imperfection
[25:44] in her body
[25:53] i was get away from that if i were you
[25:56] because
[25:57] remember in the spiritual multiplication
[26:01] we go to church daily
[26:03] and study god's word
[26:05] it's just not ever
[26:07] nine months
[26:11] okay can i end that there with the
[26:13] thought in your mind that you know what
[26:15] i'm talking about if you don't raise
[26:17] your hand i'll cover it
[26:19] i just try not to be so blunt
[26:21] to wake you thinking or you know of the
[26:23] wrong thoughts
[26:25] but now think about it
[26:29] so then eve sinned even adam sinned in
[26:32] their spirit
[26:34] not in their body not in their soul
[26:37] so word is a christian now a sinner is
[26:40] all the way sin
[26:43] he's condemned on a higher level sin is
[26:45] not even counted to him why because he's
[26:47] a sinner he's lost
[26:49] right
[26:50] so his body his spirit his soul his
[26:53] entire makeup
[26:56] his sin
[26:58] when the prophet said a sinner don't sin
[27:03] he said because he's just a sinner he's
[27:05] dead
[27:07] all right
[27:08] but see then a christian
[27:11] then we have to get into that
[27:14] debate that's been in mankind for
[27:16] probably since the beginning in
[27:19] in uh the book of acts
[27:22] as to
[27:23] how does a christian sin
[27:26] you know they don't say i've got the
[27:28] quote i've got the quote
[27:30] well amen
[27:32] i gave it to you where brother branham
[27:34] said it's impossible
[27:36] absolutely impossible for a christian to
[27:39] sin
[27:41] all right
[27:42] turns right around
[27:45] and says
[27:46] i sin every day
[27:49] well i guess he was saying he wasn't a
[27:51] christian
[27:53] you see
[27:54] i don't mind being carnal
[27:58] you know what i mean
[27:59] if you're gonna quote cardinal to me i'm
[28:01] quote carnal to you
[28:02] but if we're going to try to talk on
[28:04] sensible things we leave it alone
[28:07] the prophet said i sin every day
[28:10] but where did he sin from
[28:14] where does a christian sin from that was
[28:16] my whole point and i don't want to lose
[28:17] that point i don't want to leave that
[28:19] point
[28:20] i want you to realize it
[28:22] that a christian cannot sin with their
[28:24] body
[28:25] because it doesn't work
[28:27] and you cannot sin from the eternal soul
[28:30] because that would make sin in the soul
[28:32] and that won't work
[28:33] and that's why this bible says that his
[28:35] seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin
[28:39] all right the prophet's writing what he
[28:41] said
[28:43] it's impossible for a true christian
[28:46] born again believer to sin from their
[28:48] soul their being their person that they
[28:50] are
[28:52] because they're eternal
[28:54] and there's no way to make that soul
[28:56] to do wrong
[28:58] all right
[29:00] then there's no way that the body does
[29:02] anything because it's not it's useless
[29:04] without the spirit to operate
[29:06] so where does the christian sin from
[29:10] where did the prophet mean that he
[29:12] sinned every day
[29:15] in his memory reason conscious
[29:17] affections
[29:19] the second part of him
[29:22] that we would call then now the spirit
[29:24] part
[29:28] all right
[29:29] and just to try to show you then you
[29:31] know that's what i tried to do wednesday
[29:33] was to try to show the part that
[29:37] you know if we don't understand brother
[29:39] branham and what he's saying then you
[29:41] can make him say anything you want to
[29:43] that's right
[29:44] i gave you the quotes wednesday night
[29:46] like from blasphemy uh
[29:47] uh
[29:49] greatest battle ever fall where brother
[29:51] branham was talking about eve sinning in
[29:53] her soul
[29:56] go back to your quotes on those things
[29:58] of you sinning in her soul
[30:01] well if she send in her soul then that
[30:03] would be eternal life sin and if her
[30:05] soul was eternal
[30:08] so now you're going to back up away from
[30:10] her being eternal
[30:12] because you don't want to stay with that
[30:15] all right
[30:17] but see then if you'll just go back to
[30:19] where he was and keep in thought in mind
[30:22] of what a i've taught you for 40
[30:24] something years
[30:27] that brother branham in his early
[30:28] ministry would say
[30:31] three realms of mankind triune being of
[30:34] mankind
[30:35] body
[30:37] soul
[30:38] spirit
[30:40] now sometimes in there he would swap
[30:42] that part
[30:44] in his disgusting or preaching
[30:47] and he he will use it but he would say
[30:50] eve begin to reason
[30:55] all right where's reasoning at the
[30:57] second realm of mankind no matter what
[31:00] you call it
[31:01] so then when he comes over to the
[31:03] opening of the word
[31:04] which would fulfill the scriptures right
[31:07] hebrews 4 12 says the word is a divider
[31:10] between the joint and the mirror and the
[31:12] soul and spirit
[31:14] so
[31:15] i'm not saying he was wrong i'm saying
[31:17] that he didn't have to come and preach
[31:19] sermons upon correcting what he was
[31:22] doing because he had said that all along
[31:26] he'd always gave the outside man see
[31:29] taste filled smelling here he always
[31:31] gave the second realm no matter if he
[31:33] called it spirit or he called it soul
[31:36] he gave it the memory the reason the
[31:38] consciences and the things and he always
[31:41] gave i gave you the quotes wednesday on
[31:43] it
[31:44] like i said you go to to the greatest
[31:46] battle ever fault and listen to him and
[31:48] there's what he's saying
[31:50] then you jump over to where we were in
[31:52] uh works his faith expressed in 1965 and
[31:56] he brings it out into this body spirit
[31:58] and soul
[32:01] so it came because of the opening of the
[32:03] word hebrews 4 and 12.
[32:05] when the word opened to the prophet in
[32:07] the times of the seals and the coming
[32:09] through you'll see him coming to lining
[32:12] those things up
[32:16] but he didn't have to preach on it why
[32:19] because he had always preached it
[32:21] correctly as far as the rims
[32:25] and the senses of the rims so he didn't
[32:28] have to re-preach it
[32:32] but that way you can take what you want
[32:34] to
[32:36] you know
[32:37] because that's the way mankind does see
[32:39] your two-soul people will not quote you
[32:41] a quote after 1963-4
[32:44] about soul spirit and body and things
[32:46] like that
[32:48] no no they'll quote you every one of
[32:50] them and the oh where it's body
[32:54] soul and spirit
[32:56] and then they'll give you two souls and
[32:58] they got quotes
[33:00] but just remember
[33:03] if the bible is correct
[33:05] and if the prophet was the prophet
[33:08] he would have had to had the perfect
[33:11] interpretation as he said with divine
[33:14] vindication of the word of god
[33:17] then ezekiel
[33:19] see why this wednesday night i just quit
[33:21] because you know you go so far but
[33:23] ezekiel says what
[33:25] i give you a new heart
[33:28] and i give you a new spirit
[33:31] he says then i put my spirit in you
[33:34] and how did brother brown explain
[33:36] now he said he gave you a new heart he
[33:39] said that's a different thinking
[33:43] take away the stony heart that was
[33:46] you know hateful arrogance and things
[33:49] pulling away some of those things but
[33:52] said then
[33:53] i give you a new spirit he said that's
[33:55] not the holy spirit that's right
[33:58] all right did he take your spirit out
[34:04] you know
[34:07] if he took your spirit out then you
[34:08] would lose all your memory
[34:10] reason conscience and things
[34:12] of that person that you was
[34:16] so it's not saying that away what
[34:19] it's a reworking of that spirit
[34:23] it's cleansing that spirit it's bringing
[34:25] that spirit because he said
[34:27] i put my spirit in you he said now
[34:30] that's the holy spirit now that'll line
[34:33] up with
[34:35] five senses of the body
[34:37] five senses of the spirit and one sense
[34:40] of the soul
[34:42] that'll line right up with ezekiel it'll
[34:44] line right up with the quotes of the
[34:46] prophet it'll all be correct
[34:51] remember what he says he says our
[34:53] english language is so messed up he said
[34:56] till i say well bored he said
[34:59] you know that can be
[35:00] uh i'm bored with you
[35:05] you know and i gave more illustrations a
[35:06] little bit to it see because you can say
[35:09] i'm bored with you come on board
[35:12] this ship stand on that board
[35:15] because i'm bored with you you got a lot
[35:17] to do with board
[35:19] but the before and the after explains it
[35:23] right
[35:26] see we wonder how the prophet got the
[35:28] the things of saying that adam that uh
[35:31] abraham and sarah would turn back to a
[35:33] young man and a young woman you know
[35:35] we'll go read the before and the after
[35:38] before they were well stricken in the
[35:40] age does that what it said
[35:43] all right then after
[35:45] the kingdom wants sarah for a wife
[35:50] the before and after answers the
[35:52] question
[35:53] keep reading
[35:56] you got a question keep reading
[35:59] it'll come out
[36:01] to where you'll get to a correct
[36:02] understanding right
[36:05] now
[36:08] and try to pick up now where we left off
[36:10] dealing with wednesday night
[36:13] because i know this is i said wednesday
[36:15] and i know that when i speak i've done
[36:18] it for so many years
[36:20] maybe i do try to speak by just
[36:22] something that that i know and you know
[36:24] and been at it so long and i'm sorry
[36:27] that i'll leave you dangling
[36:29] sometimes but go back and pray about it
[36:32] and listen
[36:35] how many of you says i don't understand
[36:37] what brother dale said
[36:39] but i ain't listening to that again
[36:42] well you know it just might be if you
[36:44] listened again
[36:47] one thing you might catch it two things
[36:49] i wouldn't have to repeat it so much
[36:52] right
[36:55] don't brother dale does a lot of
[36:56] repeating right
[36:58] my brother donnie is always told brother
[37:01] donny's daddy
[37:02] brother tom always told him he said
[37:04] brother dale kind of preaches a little
[37:06] bit around on the morning and said in
[37:07] the evening he backs up and re-preaches
[37:09] and goes home you know
[37:11] but
[37:12] i want you to see who you are
[37:16] because it's not to realize what
[37:18] happened in the garden
[37:22] like i told you my daddy told my mother
[37:26] i don't claim him to be a prophet or
[37:27] anything like that i don't know where he
[37:29] ever even confessed christianity i'm
[37:32] telling you i don't know
[37:34] but she read the bible to him one time
[37:36] in genesis he couldn't read and he told
[37:39] her what happened
[37:42] and she tried his best to tell him it
[37:44] was an apple
[37:45] he laughed at her
[37:48] he was a bachelor before he got married
[37:49] i guess he knowed a whole lot and he's
[37:51] 45 years old when he got married
[37:53] all right
[37:54] but listen church
[37:58] what is it
[38:01] why is it so hard to
[38:05] preach the truth
[38:09] a lie is easy to preach
[38:12] a false doctrine is easy to preach
[38:14] you can just go every which way with it
[38:15] and it don't matter people will follow
[38:17] you but you try to preach the truth
[38:20] and you demand that people think about
[38:22] what you're saying
[38:24] you know
[38:26] to consider it
[38:28] now we're going to get to that
[38:29] eventually when we get to the new birth
[38:33] because remember you're going to have to
[38:35] go through those
[38:37] senses of spirit to get born again
[38:41] it's not that god just swoops and plops
[38:43] something down within you and
[38:45] or i was born with this seed in me and
[38:48] all i needed to do was just find out
[38:50] that i had it
[38:52] no
[38:54] it won't work too good
[38:57] see we're going to deal with how does
[38:59] god get through
[39:00] your memory your reason your conscience
[39:03] he has to come that way to speak to you
[39:08] all right
[39:11] and listen if you would read and listen
[39:14] to the prophet and listen to what i say
[39:15] a lot of time you know that brother
[39:17] brown talks about it let's see what
[39:18] message it in he talks about the flus
[39:21] is it the greatest battle ever fought
[39:24] where he talks about the flus
[39:26] he said that's what got stopped up
[39:29] with eve
[39:31] the flus
[39:32] you know what you know about the flu
[39:33] it's like you got an old boiler and it's
[39:35] got flus and it's got things in it less
[39:37] off pressure do anything
[39:41] it see us memory reason conscious
[39:43] affections
[39:44] those are the flus
[39:46] that god has to clean out to even save
[39:48] us
[39:51] and you'll find out eventually maybe why
[39:53] there's not too many
[39:56] what did the prophet say
[39:58] genuine
[39:59] new verse
[40:02] i mean that's what he said he said
[40:03] there's not
[40:05] very many genuine new verse
[40:09] because satan is still working through
[40:11] that
[40:12] all i'm doing now is trying to get the
[40:14] emphasis laid down of this is eve and
[40:16] this is what happened
[40:18] all right
[40:20] and what happened to her is happening to
[40:21] me and you
[40:26] and been happening now for 6 000 years
[40:30] in mankind
[40:33] right
[40:36] you see i would listen you know
[40:38] and try to understand
[40:42] but all right
[40:44] getting to the point kind of where we
[40:46] left off because i i
[40:48] i made the statement and i i don't mind
[40:51] making statements about things because i
[40:54] want to be right and i want to help be
[40:56] helped for number one but i i want you
[40:58] to understand what i'm talking about and
[41:01] you know we talked a lot last wednesday
[41:03] about blasphemous names where brother
[41:05] branham was covering
[41:06] that adam god breathed into his nostrils
[41:10] the breath of eternal life
[41:12] and he became an eternal person with god
[41:15] all right now that was not in his body
[41:19] because his body was a creation
[41:23] all right
[41:24] now that was not in his spirit as we
[41:27] talk about the second realm of mankind
[41:29] the memory reason conscious affections
[41:32] etc because that would not have been
[41:35] eternal it was this god permitting that
[41:38] to exist in the human being
[41:40] but it was in the soul of mankind and he
[41:42] became a living soul
[41:45] and i tried to explain it through a lot
[41:47] of things at the prophet because that
[41:49] was what i had to to base it on
[41:51] of bro where brother branham would even
[41:54] cover that
[41:55] even adam was together in theophany
[42:01] and that when adam was put
[42:03] into flesh
[42:05] he was lonely
[42:06] because part of his being was still in
[42:09] theophany
[42:12] all right
[42:13] but see we've got it all figured out we
[42:15] we're so revelated about the theophany
[42:18] until all we got is
[42:20] i got one up in heaven
[42:25] that's that's all we can deal with
[42:29] we don't even consider
[42:31] listen we don't even memory reason
[42:33] consciousness
[42:37] right
[42:39] we got it figured out
[42:41] and i'm not going to take anything else
[42:44] you remember when we believed in the
[42:45] trinity
[42:48] and there was no way for nobody to
[42:49] explain it any different
[42:52] because that's what we believe and we
[42:54] had bible for it
[42:59] her was jesus and there was the there
[43:02] was the dove coming down in the void we
[43:04] had it all kind didn't we
[43:07] but see one day we found out we didn't
[43:09] have the truth
[43:14] i like that scripture it says and you
[43:17] shall know the truth
[43:19] it doesn't say you shall know truth
[43:22] it doesn't say you shall know about
[43:24] truth
[43:25] it says you shall know thee
[43:28] singular truth
[43:30] and the truth will set you free
[43:32] all right
[43:34] i believe this message is the truth
[43:36] right
[43:38] amen
[43:38] but think about it now
[43:41] if part of adam
[43:44] wasn't fully
[43:45] complete upon earth even though he had
[43:47] been given eternal life
[43:50] even though he was there in in in the
[43:53] you know
[43:54] in the garden
[43:57] the full creation of man you know
[44:00] that he was body spirit and soul a human
[44:02] being
[44:03] and that god gave eternal life to him
[44:06] and his soul he became an eternal person
[44:09] with god all right
[44:13] after all of that he was still lonely
[44:16] why because as part of him wasn't there
[44:19] at that
[44:20] time right
[44:22] that was the part of him that would be
[44:24] what we would call eve
[44:27] but she never had that name
[44:29] she never received that name eve until
[44:31] she failed
[44:32] because adam had the 126-27 man has no
[44:36] name to it
[44:39] it's the two six or seven
[44:41] that he forms him from the dust of the
[44:43] earth and then he comes on down later
[44:45] and names him adam
[44:50] because it means the beginning or the
[44:52] red man that starts you know we do it
[44:55] and eve means the mother of all living
[44:57] well she couldn't have that name until
[44:59] she became the mother of all living
[45:03] she was woman
[45:05] part of adam
[45:08] you know
[45:10] right
[45:12] all right but part of him was missing
[45:14] and then when that part was put into he
[45:16] took a rib from from adam
[45:19] and he gave that
[45:21] a flesh
[45:23] and he gave it a spirit and a soul of a
[45:25] being to live
[45:27] you know
[45:29] making it a triune being
[45:32] and then he breathed into the nostrils
[45:33] of eve and she became an eternal person
[45:37] with god
[45:38] all right
[45:40] i made the statements
[45:42] because like i said i try to be honest
[45:44] that i couldn't find any statements
[45:46] talking literally of eve but i took it
[45:48] from the scriptural point of the fact of
[45:52] christ in the church
[45:54] and the things of that and taking it
[45:56] from eve still being in theophany and
[45:59] adam
[46:01] already put into human flesh and then
[46:03] bringing forth eve into being well we
[46:06] went outside and wade found this one so
[46:08] let's go ahead and read this one
[46:10] let's see what brother branham said on
[46:12] go to number three brothers
[46:15] which is why some people can't keep the
[46:17] victory
[46:18] 1957 327 e77 look what he says
[46:28] there was no harm could come the tiger
[46:30] laid down the line that
[46:32] the leo the line
[46:34] laid down nothing would harm
[46:36] then alone came sin brother
[46:39] it's for that beautiful picture
[46:42] eve would have never needed max factor
[46:44] to fix her cosmetic face
[46:48] no sir it was god
[46:50] the very blush of eternal life in her
[46:53] made her beautiful
[46:54] amen so now i've got the quote from the
[46:57] prophet so i'll quote him with it i was
[46:59] quoting it from my own right okay and
[47:01] didn't mind telling you that was what i
[47:03] was doing
[47:04] i could have flagged you and tried to
[47:06] make you think i know what i was talking
[47:08] about
[47:09] but see now i do i don't have to worry
[47:10] about it she would never have to have
[47:12] manicures and everything like that they
[47:15] do today sin is what brought you to that
[47:18] place
[47:19] all right
[47:21] now think about it
[47:24] i did have these quotes
[47:27] you see it that one i don't have to
[47:28] worry about it because it's a direct
[47:30] quote see
[47:31] it ain't something you got to presume
[47:35] because it says the very blush of
[47:36] eternal life in her made her beautiful
[47:39] all right
[47:41] see i had these and i'll give you some
[47:42] more after a while but go ahead to
[47:44] number four which is what shall i do
[47:46] with jesus call christ in 1963 11 24
[47:50] paragraph 188 would be where you come
[47:53] down to it
[47:55] look he was keeping her
[48:00] in eternal life
[48:03] as long as she stayed with that word
[48:06] when she broke that word
[48:08] she had the promise of god that she
[48:10] would die the day that she broke it and
[48:13] when she broke it she died that's right
[48:16] i had those quotes and another i'll give
[48:18] you in the seal book in a minute but i'm
[48:21] talking about i like those words i don't
[48:23] have to worry about it and and you got
[48:25] the problem
[48:28] to where i can just read it and say that
[48:29] she had the blush of eternal life
[48:33] all right
[48:34] why wouldn't we believe that because we
[48:36] she's supposed to be a type of the
[48:38] church
[48:41] and i thought the church that we
[48:42] believed it had eternal life
[48:44] all right
[48:46] and she was
[48:47] that eternal life was keeping her in the
[48:50] right place
[48:52] as long as she was staying in that right
[48:54] place behind the word
[48:56] all right
[48:58] but when she becomes separated
[49:01] and put into
[49:02] a form of a flesh
[49:05] and began to walk away from that word
[49:07] because of her
[49:11] part that satan began to work through
[49:13] which would have been her spirit realm
[49:16] then she begins to accept satan's lie
[49:21] all right
[49:24] did the prophet say you don't have to
[49:25] worry about that old guy with the
[49:27] overall dome with your wife it's that
[49:29] slick tongue guy and let me put that
[49:31] slick tongue preacher let me put that
[49:33] other word in there
[49:34] that's the guy that's doing the
[49:35] deceiving as i said a while ago because
[49:37] satan's got his preachers right
[49:41] and they were even called as ministers
[49:43] of righteousness
[49:44] you know that in the scripture about
[49:45] satan and his angels
[49:48] see satan don't want to bring up
[49:49] something that's not righteous
[49:53] he's just trying to put his hand into it
[49:56] like i said he don't go to the juke
[49:58] joints the liquor hogs and the things
[50:00] today he's in church
[50:02] he was the anointed cherub that stood
[50:04] beside the lord he loves he was over the
[50:06] worship part
[50:08] right he loves to go to church he loves
[50:10] to hear good music and good singing
[50:14] you know
[50:16] why
[50:17] because he was created that way
[50:22] standing beside the lord
[50:27] he doesn't want to don't want to garbage
[50:28] cans
[50:30] i mean
[50:32] he wants to be in church with the people
[50:35] he wants you to be in church
[50:40] right
[50:41] he don't want you to stay at home
[50:45] the devil made me stay at home no he
[50:47] didn't
[50:50] he wants you to go because he wants to
[50:51] go with you
[50:54] you know what
[50:56] okay
[50:58] you say well brother dale you shouldn't
[51:00] be okay i shouldn't be but i am forgive
[51:03] me
[51:04] but is it the truth
[51:06] okay
[51:09] all right
[51:10] no problems right
[51:12] it's the truth
[51:15] satan wants to go to church
[51:17] and have a good time
[51:20] do you think let me just put this in
[51:21] here as a personal thought
[51:23] do you think he really wanted to enter
[51:25] the human race
[51:27] as just some
[51:30] way of doing things
[51:35] or would it really be the truth to say
[51:37] that he wanted the human race to worship
[51:40] him right which one do you think
[51:43] right
[51:44] well i know what the prophet said said
[51:46] that was the only way because he could
[51:47] enter the human race
[51:49] because by entering human race see
[51:50] that's where he gets worshipped from the
[51:51] human
[51:52] but really is it not so just what i say
[51:54] it that
[51:56] he wants worship
[51:59] he wants people to believe he is god
[52:02] to be as god's wasn't that what he told
[52:04] eve
[52:06] knowing good and evil
[52:09] all right
[52:10] and the bible speaks of the god of this
[52:12] evil age
[52:16] he wants worship
[52:18] and brother branham may i quote him as
[52:21] to say
[52:22] he said you can call him jesus jesus
[52:26] and worship the devil
[52:32] okay
[52:35] well i
[52:36] i know who i'm worshiping
[52:39] do you
[52:42] do you really know who you worship
[52:45] well he's that sweet thing that comes to
[52:47] me that's
[52:49] i know i got got in trouble trying to
[52:51] explain that but i'll do it again try to
[52:54] help you
[52:55] it ain't always a sweet voice that god
[52:57] speaks with
[53:01] sometimes he says sit down shut up and
[53:05] listen
[53:07] it ain't that sweetness oh you're so
[53:10] wonderful you're so great remember
[53:14] that's the way he got to eaves
[53:20] that's the way he got to her with that
[53:22] beautiful slick tongue
[53:25] right
[53:27] what you say what brother dale
[53:31] you mean you believe that a
[53:33] a christian can do wrong
[53:43] we'll read a little bit more i want you
[53:45] to think
[53:49] but i'm sealed in
[53:52] satan can't get into me
[53:54] i'm glad you thought of that
[53:58] because remember
[54:00] the prophet says it this way
[54:05] you say the devil come and got me
[54:09] go ahead with number seven
[54:12] well they're getting there i'll read on
[54:14] it says no he never
[54:16] you went out to him
[54:19] now
[54:20] he is not explaining
[54:23] that you have eternal life in your soul
[54:26] and eternal life in your soul goes out
[54:29] to the devil
[54:31] now if that's what you think you really
[54:32] do need a brain transplant
[54:38] he talking about
[54:39] so the bible says you're dead your life
[54:41] is hidden in god through cross sealed by
[54:44] the holy ghost how could the devil get
[54:46] you you went out
[54:48] that's right
[54:49] devil never got you you went out
[54:55] now we're not talking about going out
[54:57] and doing
[54:58] hideous
[55:00] outlandish things
[55:04] because anyone ought to know the
[55:05] difference in that
[55:10] but what about it
[55:15] look at the next one number eight which
[55:16] is questions and answers
[55:18] 1954. and he's talking about backsliding
[55:25] and every day i do if i do that
[55:28] now listen to what he's saying
[55:30] now we was talking on the word
[55:32] backsliding this morning when you do
[55:34] that your backslid yes sir
[55:37] you got to repent is that right now
[55:39] i don't mean to say if you went out in
[55:42] the world and did this and that
[55:45] but you've done something
[55:48] you've got to repent and die daily to
[55:50] live in jesus christ so every day
[55:53] every day you've got to die every day to
[55:55] live in christ
[55:57] now is that just what i said
[56:01] you backslide you got to repent
[56:03] i don't mean to say you went out in the
[56:06] world and you did this and that
[56:10] you didn't go out in the world and do
[56:12] the harl you know the hard things
[56:15] the no no
[56:17] you just backslid
[56:22] my definition is backsliding is one
[56:25] thing
[56:26] if you're standing still you're
[56:28] backsliding
[56:31] now hi brother dale i've been standing
[56:33] still for a long time i've been standing
[56:36] still
[56:37] you're backsliding because god's moving
[56:42] in the days of martin luther when the
[56:43] just shall live by faith was wonderful
[56:45] but one day wesley preached
[56:47] sanctification and you just stood still
[56:49] in your justification what did it become
[56:52] denominational
[56:54] because god's moving the pillar of fires
[56:57] never stopped
[56:58] my brother around said he liked the way
[57:00] paul was he said he wasn't satisfied no
[57:02] one place
[57:04] he said he was constantly moving
[57:06] well the holy spirit don't stop in one
[57:08] place
[57:09] it may have said a day or two there in
[57:11] the old testament where they camped
[57:12] around there but the first thing you
[57:14] know is up moving
[57:16] all right you say but i can't backslide
[57:19] no
[57:21] if you're with that attitude you can't
[57:24] i'm gonna agree with you if you're that
[57:25] attitude not sarcastic about it that you
[57:28] can't do it i'm going to agree with you
[57:30] because you never was saying start with
[57:32] if that's the way you think
[57:35] if you think you can't do nothing wrong
[57:43] but yet you know you do
[57:46] well it wasn't me as that devil made me
[57:48] do it
[57:50] now remember
[57:51] the prophet said you went out
[57:57] that you went out
[58:00] satan can't get in because you're sealed
[58:02] right
[58:06] but you can certainly go out into his
[58:08] realm
[58:10] and if you
[58:11] think you don't then i'm going to tell
[58:13] you to start with your lost
[58:15] you need to get some salvation where
[58:17] you'll begin to find out you do and can
[58:20] do wrong
[58:23] but i've never heard nobody preach like
[58:24] that
[58:27] well
[58:29] where have you been
[58:33] the prophet said we sin every day
[58:36] the prophet said we do wrong
[58:38] the prophet said i done wrong did i told
[58:41] my wife
[58:43] not big things
[58:44] he said i told my wife it wasn't three
[58:46] great men
[58:49] right
[58:50] one of them was born in kentucky
[58:53] which was he's talking about himself
[58:54] right
[58:55] you know what
[58:58] she kind of let him have it
[59:01] you know what he didn't say a thing
[59:04] he went repented
[59:12] but you see we don't want to admit those
[59:14] things
[59:16] so we want to prop it up by saying
[59:19] that it wasn't me it was the devil made
[59:22] me do it
[59:24] well you got him pretty close to you
[59:26] then
[59:27] if he made you do it
[59:30] right right
[59:32] he's pretty close
[59:36] and you know what
[59:38] i'm as honest as i can be about it
[59:40] how many has ever heard me make this
[59:42] statement i don't blame the devil for
[59:43] everything i do
[59:49] you may blame the devil you may say the
[59:51] devils when it caused it i don't say
[59:53] that
[59:55] because a lot of things i don't believe
[59:56] the devil would even come up with it to
[59:58] try to get me to do that thing
[1:00:00] it's me
[1:00:01] in my memory my reason my conscience my
[1:00:05] things
[1:00:06] remember there is the position where
[1:00:08] lust comes forth
[1:00:10] because the body cannot lust without the
[1:00:13] spirit
[1:00:15] there is the position of a lot of things
[1:00:18] dealing in that spirit realm that we
[1:00:20] talk about
[1:00:22] all right
[1:00:24] what do you think about it
[1:00:31] we're constantly trying to get rid of
[1:00:33] the devil
[1:00:35] and we need to
[1:00:38] but maybe someday we need to look
[1:00:40] straight at our own selves
[1:00:45] you know what
[1:00:49] say lord i'm sorry for what i've done
[1:00:52] there's no need of you trying to beg god
[1:00:54] to forgive you for something the devil
[1:00:57] done
[1:01:00] did that come out right
[1:01:02] i hope it did
[1:01:06] do we repent for what the devil made us
[1:01:08] do
[1:01:17] getting mighty clothes ain't it
[1:01:20] we need to repent for what we do
[1:01:25] wrong thoughts wrong ideas
[1:01:28] wrong speaking back out of our mouth
[1:01:32] wrong life
[1:01:37] but then we want to prop it up and say
[1:01:38] well well i didn't really do that
[1:01:41] he was the devil
[1:01:43] the prophet said
[1:01:46] you went out
[1:01:48] he can't get in
[1:01:51] but now remember though he can get into
[1:01:53] your spirit
[1:01:56] and he can get into your body
[1:01:59] by way of your spirit
[1:02:04] right
[1:02:07] it's just he can't it's just that he
[1:02:09] can't get in your soul because it's
[1:02:10] sealed in
[1:02:14] and that soul cannot sin
[1:02:17] if it's born again
[1:02:20] because it's sealed in
[1:02:23] i had some quotes a few one of them
[1:02:25] maybe at the end
[1:02:26] where the prophet was talking about
[1:02:29] the life and the way we do
[1:02:33] but why worry why not just be sensible
[1:02:38] why not just think about it in a line
[1:02:41] that we can
[1:02:42] see
[1:02:44] of life
[1:02:49] and to realize that you and i
[1:02:53] are dying
[1:02:56] now if you don't think you are
[1:03:03] i would invite you to go get some
[1:03:05] pictures you've got to view when he's
[1:03:07] about 20 and look at you now
[1:03:12] you might find out you've been dying a
[1:03:14] whole lot
[1:03:17] right
[1:03:20] now if you
[1:03:22] think that you cannot sin
[1:03:24] then if you cannot sin
[1:03:28] then where would death come involved at
[1:03:35] what actually happened in the garden
[1:03:39] that is still
[1:03:40] controlling you and i tonight
[1:03:44] brother brandon made some statements
[1:03:50] about those things
[1:03:52] but what do we think
[1:03:59] as i said we take the
[1:04:01] quotes of
[1:04:03] where he said body soul spirit
[1:04:09] we take that and prove a point with it
[1:04:13] then we take where he says body spirit
[1:04:16] soul
[1:04:16] we take that and prove a point with it
[1:04:19] but do we see that it ties together as i
[1:04:22] said to were
[1:04:23] that he was never wrong in what he was
[1:04:26] saying
[1:04:27] he was just saying his words different
[1:04:30] and if you will go into the bible i
[1:04:33] invite you to do this study the bible a
[1:04:37] little bit about the word spirit
[1:04:44] do you know that there is no written
[1:04:47] definition of spirit
[1:04:51] now what i mean by
[1:04:52] that i mean the word spirit
[1:04:56] has the meaning of what it is
[1:04:59] yeah
[1:05:00] but it does not divide between whether
[1:05:02] it's holy spirit
[1:05:04] or your spirit
[1:05:10] well
[1:05:12] the before and the after is the way
[1:05:14] you'd find out which one it's talking
[1:05:15] about
[1:05:18] in other words you read
[1:05:20] and it talks about the holy spirit
[1:05:22] coming on the day of pentecost and it's
[1:05:23] all about spirit you know what that is
[1:05:25] that's eternal life
[1:05:27] but when it's talking about the spirit
[1:05:29] of man
[1:05:32] as he reasons
[1:05:35] that's just the spirit of man
[1:05:42] see you're gonna have to make a decision
[1:05:43] upon your own selves it's not that you
[1:05:45] can just decide well we'll uh
[1:05:50] i don't understand why brother brown
[1:05:51] would say this and why he would say that
[1:05:53] so i'll just
[1:05:55] try to somehow stay in the middle
[1:05:59] well
[1:06:03] the bible says to
[1:06:05] repent everyone and be baptized in the
[1:06:06] name of
[1:06:08] the father and of the son and of the
[1:06:10] holy ghost
[1:06:12] and it says lord jesus christ
[1:06:15] now which one do you want
[1:06:21] am i right
[1:06:24] see anybody that is baptized correctly
[1:06:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ is
[1:06:29] baptized according to matthew 28 19
[1:06:33] to fulfill that commission your prophet
[1:06:35] said one day and that's the way i
[1:06:36] baptize to fulfill the commission that
[1:06:39] the lord said to baptize this way in
[1:06:41] matthew 28 19 to do that now i baptize
[1:06:44] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:47] now i have they're not either one
[1:06:50] both of them are correct
[1:06:52] both of them are written by men
[1:06:57] that
[1:06:58] by the time matthew was written
[1:07:00] matthew was full of the holy ghost
[1:07:03] because it wasn't written right while
[1:07:05] they were doing writing it down it's
[1:07:06] probably somewhere around 50 years later
[1:07:08] almost before some of your writings were
[1:07:11] made and brought into beings and a lot
[1:07:13] of things
[1:07:15] if you'd study your bible you might find
[1:07:17] out
[1:07:19] all right
[1:07:21] now
[1:07:25] if you're a christian
[1:07:29] a truly born-again christian
[1:07:32] is it possible for you to ever be lost
[1:07:38] if you're a true born-again christian
[1:07:43] because i'll give you the quote if you
[1:07:44] like it where brother branham said
[1:07:46] there's no way you could do that he said
[1:07:48] because what you would be doing he said
[1:07:51] then you would be putting god in hell
[1:07:56] and said that won't work
[1:07:59] he said you can't burn eternally
[1:08:03] you can burn forever and ever
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] but you can't burn eternally
[1:08:09] you'd have to have eternal life to burn
[1:08:10] eternally
[1:08:12] so that would put god's own life in hell
[1:08:14] and you can't do that
[1:08:18] but sometimes he'll make a statement
[1:08:20] that you've got to really think about
[1:08:23] and consider the matter and wait for god
[1:08:25] to reveal it
[1:08:29] and our biggest problem is is is one
[1:08:31] thing is that we
[1:08:34] you know a lot of people do well that
[1:08:36] don't matter to me hell no matter where
[1:08:37] his father's on the holy ghost lord
[1:08:38] jesus christ long as i'm baptized i'm
[1:08:40] all right
[1:08:44] but it don't matter to me whether it's
[1:08:45] three gods or one god or what long as i
[1:08:47] get there
[1:08:52] that's caused a lot of organized
[1:08:53] religions
[1:08:55] in the world
[1:08:57] so you make your choice
[1:09:00] but can you fall from eternal life
[1:09:04] then we would have to make and establish
[1:09:06] the point there would be no way that you
[1:09:08] could fall from eternal life because if
[1:09:10] you did you would be falling to hell
[1:09:13] you know you would be lost
[1:09:16] of that
[1:09:17] now when he makes this statement about
[1:09:19] adam and eve
[1:09:22] then we've got to analyze the statement
[1:09:24] that he made
[1:09:28] to think about it
[1:09:31] look at what he said happened in the
[1:09:32] garden go ahead to number nine brother
[1:09:38] this is taken from the breach
[1:09:40] between the church ages and seals 63
[1:09:43] 317. we'll go paragraph
[1:09:46] 90 through
[1:09:48] 93 i think it is
[1:09:52] and when a person is struck with disease
[1:09:54] aches and pain
[1:09:55] one time they wasn't that way but
[1:09:57] they're groaning why
[1:09:58] they're not right there's something
[1:10:00] wrong and they're groaning and trying to
[1:10:02] get back to where they was when they had
[1:10:04] helped
[1:10:06] and when nature and people as the bible
[1:10:08] said are groaning it shows there's
[1:10:10] something that they're not in their
[1:10:12] ought to be conditioned
[1:10:14] they have fallen
[1:10:15] from somewhere
[1:10:19] now we don't need anybody to interpret
[1:10:21] that for us see for of course we have uh
[1:10:25] for of course we know it was eternal
[1:10:27] life they had fallen from
[1:10:35] take that quote
[1:10:36] go with it now
[1:10:38] you just shook your head and nodded
[1:10:40] almost grand amen while ago
[1:10:42] that you couldn't fall from eternal life
[1:10:47] i've heard that
[1:10:49] tried to explain by
[1:10:51] some i won't call the name
[1:10:55] that said that they could fall back
[1:10:58] there
[1:11:01] but we couldn't fall now
[1:11:04] no i don't
[1:11:09] remember he's not an ending giver you
[1:11:11] need that it's in here
[1:11:13] he's not an ending giver
[1:11:15] and he's not different than who he gives
[1:11:16] it to and takes it away
[1:11:19] he don't give you something to take it
[1:11:21] away from you
[1:11:23] can i quote the prophet he ain't going
[1:11:25] to save you knowing that you're going to
[1:11:26] be lost
[1:11:28] right so now what's he talking about
[1:11:34] for of course we know it was eternal
[1:11:36] life they had fallen from and they lost
[1:11:38] their claims on eternal life by the fall
[1:11:40] of adam and eve who fell from eternal
[1:11:43] life to death
[1:11:45] in the garden of eden and brought all
[1:11:46] nature under them to death
[1:11:50] now what's he talking about
[1:11:59] how can you fall from eternal life
[1:12:04] well i just like this brother dale i'm
[1:12:07] just going to believe it because prophet
[1:12:08] said it
[1:12:13] well
[1:12:14] the bible says to be baptized father son
[1:12:16] holocaust
[1:12:25] it's quiet don't it
[1:12:28] but you see you say well why do we need
[1:12:30] to understand these things
[1:12:38] why do you need to know whether you're
[1:12:40] singing that
[1:12:44] if you could ever convince yourself one
[1:12:46] time that you had sinned since you
[1:12:48] received the holy ghost and just one
[1:12:50] time
[1:12:51] you would realize and think that you're
[1:12:53] totally lost
[1:12:56] unless you knew where the sin was coming
[1:12:58] from
[1:13:00] that it's coming from the spirit part of
[1:13:01] you and not the soul
[1:13:04] now you've got the devil's answer
[1:13:11] all right
[1:13:15] so what does he say
[1:13:17] tree never died before adam
[1:13:20] let's get to before and after okay
[1:13:23] an animal wouldn't die before adam
[1:13:26] there's only one thing that cannot die
[1:13:27] and that's god because he's eternal
[1:13:31] that's the only way we can ever keep
[1:13:33] from dying
[1:13:35] we have to have eternal life in us
[1:13:38] to be sons and daughters of god
[1:13:42] but when we die as i said in the morning
[1:13:44] message this morning
[1:13:47] to sin we sold out our birthright and
[1:13:50] crossed this chasm
[1:13:52] now we're beyond the reach of god on
[1:13:54] this other side of the chasm
[1:13:58] of course when adam fell to death he
[1:14:00] brought death upon all creation
[1:14:03] now he was given free moral agency it
[1:14:05] was given to them just as we so
[1:14:08] to make a choice
[1:14:10] now adam and eve in the beginning there
[1:14:12] was a tree of
[1:14:15] right and wrong before them
[1:14:18] and that sign tree sets before each and
[1:14:21] and every one of us
[1:14:23] see god isn't doing for adam or for eve
[1:14:26] you say well it's their fault
[1:14:29] no
[1:14:30] not now it isn't
[1:14:32] it's your fault
[1:14:34] you can't place it on adam and eve you
[1:14:36] got to place it on yourself because
[1:14:38] right and wrong is set before you
[1:14:40] we're on the same basis as adam and eve
[1:14:43] now
[1:14:47] so we have to
[1:14:53] and i have to because
[1:14:55] i'm a minister this brought this topic
[1:14:57] up
[1:14:58] and i'm not one of those type of
[1:15:00] ministers that'll bring up a topic
[1:15:04] and uh just leave that topic to where
[1:15:07] that you can think what you want to
[1:15:10] as a man said one time i despise it when
[1:15:12] a man asks a question when he's the only
[1:15:14] one that's got the answer i said i
[1:15:16] wouldn't have asked it if i didn't have
[1:15:18] the answer
[1:15:21] amen because it would have been
[1:15:23] stupidity to ask the question i didn't
[1:15:24] have an answer from the man i was
[1:15:27] talking to and i'm not gonna bring that
[1:15:29] up but
[1:15:30] he wound up thinking he was this great
[1:15:32] prophet and all of these things and
[1:15:35] you had to go ride some horses with him
[1:15:37] and getting on some of the digging up
[1:15:39] some gold plates and things
[1:15:41] i ain't joking you
[1:15:43] but
[1:15:47] what is your thoughts then that brother
[1:15:49] random said adam and eve fell from
[1:15:51] eternal life
[1:15:52] to death
[1:16:00] what is your thoughts on that
[1:16:05] now
[1:16:08] remember
[1:16:11] i didn't think to bring this one but
[1:16:16] the prophet said that the tree of life
[1:16:18] was in the garden
[1:16:21] to remind adam
[1:16:23] that his youth
[1:16:24] was being renewed
[1:16:29] i'll be glad to find that one somebody
[1:16:31] can run it in a hurry and then throw it
[1:16:32] on the screen
[1:16:36] he said the tree was there to remind
[1:16:37] adam that his youth was being renewed
[1:16:40] why because adam's body was not
[1:16:46] eternal adam's spirit was not eternal
[1:16:50] it was his soul that was eternal
[1:16:57] well then did he lose eternal life in
[1:16:59] his soul
[1:17:03] i don't think so
[1:17:06] i make that statement as your pastor as
[1:17:08] to what you
[1:17:09] say well brother dale we we're dependent
[1:17:11] upon you to give us answers to things
[1:17:14] and i try
[1:17:15] might not be the right one a lot of
[1:17:17] times but i do the best i can
[1:17:19] all right
[1:17:22] in the context that the prophet is
[1:17:25] talking about
[1:17:27] he does not deal with and you read it
[1:17:30] we'll put it back up and let you read it
[1:17:32] is not re he is not talking about
[1:17:36] adam and eve
[1:17:38] going to hell
[1:17:41] because the atonement had already been
[1:17:43] made
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:49] it wasn't that
[1:17:51] you remember the atonement was made for
[1:17:52] the foundation world
[1:17:55] so adam and eve could not have been lost
[1:17:56] and go to hell
[1:17:58] i can quote a little bit if you like
[1:18:00] where brother brown said one of these
[1:18:02] days in the resurrection adam will reach
[1:18:03] over and get eve he's reach over and get
[1:18:06] able able reach over and get set
[1:18:08] and the resurrection will come
[1:18:11] all right
[1:18:14] but what is he talking about now
[1:18:17] is he talking about does he referring
[1:18:20] any here to the eternal life of adam and
[1:18:23] soul
[1:18:24] and eve
[1:18:25] or is he
[1:18:26] really talking about the
[1:18:29] fact that
[1:18:31] death
[1:18:33] had not entered the picture
[1:18:37] at the time of the fall
[1:18:39] that was the first death
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:44] at the time of the fall was the first
[1:18:45] death
[1:18:47] whatever you want to make it natural
[1:18:48] spiritual whatever
[1:18:50] and he talking about that
[1:18:53] the trees never died before adam
[1:18:56] an animal wouldn't die before adam
[1:19:05] could it be made into a simple
[1:19:06] conclusion then of what he's just
[1:19:08] talking about
[1:19:09] to worry that it would tie matthew 28 19
[1:19:12] together with acts 2 38
[1:19:14] or would tie together where he would say
[1:19:16] one day
[1:19:17] come and let's address the third person
[1:19:19] of the trinity
[1:19:21] and then turn around and say there's no
[1:19:22] such thing in the bible
[1:19:26] could it be that god is using a man to
[1:19:31] leave a situation that would become very
[1:19:33] very
[1:19:35] uh confusing
[1:19:38] to mankind
[1:19:40] because i can take one quote and throw
[1:19:41] adam and eve in hell i can take another
[1:19:43] quote and put them in heaven
[1:19:47] now is that all we need to do it's just
[1:19:49] a quote or do we need a decision
[1:19:52] somewhere
[1:19:53] an understanding a revelation
[1:19:57] so adam and eve never lost eternal life
[1:19:59] in their
[1:20:02] soul but they lost the ability to come
[1:20:06] forth in eternal life
[1:20:09] in human flesh
[1:20:12] that's right
[1:20:14] consider that point
[1:20:16] they never achieved what they were set
[1:20:19] here for
[1:20:21] they were put here to come forth and
[1:20:24] bring forth all of us
[1:20:27] not all mankind but all of the genuine
[1:20:30] part as we covered the other day would
[1:20:32] have come forth
[1:20:34] they would have brought forth that
[1:20:35] christ as the prophet had to say
[1:20:39] well did did they lose eternal life in
[1:20:42] soul
[1:20:44] or did they lose the ability to bring
[1:20:47] eternal life into being
[1:20:49] because remember the scriptures we've
[1:20:51] read and we read a quote there
[1:20:54] a moment ago from the prophet talking
[1:20:56] about it that the tree of life was in
[1:20:58] the garden
[1:21:01] as i said to you wednesday night then if
[1:21:04] sin had not entered the picture you
[1:21:06] would have still had mankind as a body
[1:21:09] and a spirit as to be mortal with an
[1:21:12] eternal soul
[1:21:15] but yet you could have went to the tree
[1:21:17] of life
[1:21:19] and partook of the tree of life because
[1:21:21] it was in the garden and they could eat
[1:21:24] of the tree of life before they fail
[1:21:27] read your bible
[1:21:31] remember as quick as they fail placed
[1:21:34] out
[1:21:34] guard what
[1:21:37] the way
[1:21:39] of the tree of life
[1:21:40] now get back in the garden the way of
[1:21:42] the tree of life
[1:21:45] and i remember when i was in the baptist
[1:21:47] church as a preacher preached a message
[1:21:49] one day and you know that stuck to me
[1:21:51] yet
[1:21:52] go in the bible and read about
[1:21:55] the way
[1:21:58] just read about the way
[1:22:01] just take a concordance and read the way
[1:22:06] jesus said i am the way
[1:22:08] the truth and the life
[1:22:12] and you know that stuck with me till
[1:22:13] today of thinking about him being the
[1:22:16] way
[1:22:17] and remember they were not to guard the
[1:22:19] garden
[1:22:21] as we think they were to guard the way
[1:22:24] of the tree of life
[1:22:28] that's what your bible says
[1:22:31] here comes a prophet with a great
[1:22:33] understanding and he said those angels
[1:22:36] that were guarding the way of the tree
[1:22:39] of life
[1:22:40] are no longer doing that he says they're
[1:22:43] trying to drive us to that
[1:22:47] what the way the truth and the life
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:55] see adam never failed to be lost
[1:22:59] but he never achieved
[1:23:02] what he was put here to do
[1:23:04] because once we would have all come had
[1:23:06] there been no fall
[1:23:08] you could went to the tree of life and
[1:23:10] made partaker of the tree of life and
[1:23:12] become eternal in body spirit and soul
[1:23:18] all right well i thought that's what
[1:23:21] we're doing now
[1:23:24] i thought that's what's going on
[1:23:27] i thought we were supposed to be born
[1:23:28] again by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:31] and i thought the tree of life was the
[1:23:33] word of god
[1:23:36] that we are now partaking of that will
[1:23:38] one day
[1:23:40] make this body
[1:23:42] and spirit that i am eternal
[1:23:46] right
[1:23:51] so really the only difference is just
[1:23:52] the way it's happening
[1:23:57] and thank god it's happening
[1:24:00] so they never lost
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:09] they lost the ability to bring it forth
[1:24:12] let's read number 10.
[1:24:16] go ahead with number 10.
[1:24:18] the third seal
[1:24:19] now notice the natural woman failed and
[1:24:21] god made a way for her to be redeemed
[1:24:23] although she had fallen he made a way
[1:24:26] now that was the first bride on earth
[1:24:27] fell before her husband and her were
[1:24:29] married she fell by
[1:24:32] the reason of
[1:24:34] reasoning
[1:24:36] instead of staying with the word she
[1:24:37] fell and she fell to death watch eternal
[1:24:40] separation
[1:24:45] i don't mind putting them in
[1:24:49] when i know what i'm talking about now
[1:24:50] before i know what i'm talking about i
[1:24:52] ain't going to put them in
[1:24:53] okay
[1:24:56] look
[1:24:57] she fell to death eternal separation
[1:24:59] with her she took her husband and
[1:25:01] everything else with her on the earth
[1:25:03] she failed
[1:25:04] you see eternal separation
[1:25:11] adam and eve
[1:25:13] never reached the position
[1:25:16] they were supposed to have reached
[1:25:19] so they fell to death
[1:25:22] and death is eternal separation
[1:25:25] you realize had god not come
[1:25:29] in human flesh
[1:25:31] and made away
[1:25:33] their death would have been
[1:25:36] eternal separation
[1:25:42] but by him coming
[1:25:44] he ended that stage
[1:25:46] you ever noticed the scripture that
[1:25:48] people are bad quote
[1:25:49] disappointed on the man wants to die
[1:25:51] everybody says we gotta die
[1:25:53] it's appointed unto man wants to die
[1:25:56] have you ever noticed this statement
[1:25:58] brother branham made
[1:26:01] he said jesus broke the scriptures
[1:26:10] he hadn't never read that
[1:26:13] he broke the scriptures
[1:26:16] now if he broke the scriptures he's
[1:26:20] lost now what's he talking about
[1:26:26] the scripture that said it's appointed
[1:26:28] unto man wants to die
[1:26:29] when jesus christ died on that cross
[1:26:32] that scripture can never be used again
[1:26:38] it was broken
[1:26:40] it was fulfilled through the life of
[1:26:42] christ
[1:26:44] and lost
[1:26:46] or taken out of the way
[1:26:48] so he broke that scripture
[1:26:52] by fulfilling it
[1:26:54] as to be life
[1:27:02] adam and eve never was lost and went to
[1:27:04] hell
[1:27:05] they just never achieved
[1:27:08] the eternal life in body and spirit
[1:27:12] that way they were meant to be
[1:27:16] but someday somebody will
[1:27:20] why don't we contend that we're part of
[1:27:22] it and believe for it we've been left
[1:27:24] around here a long time for some reason
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:29] so why not just enjoy what's happening
[1:27:31] and say thank you lord
[1:27:33] you know
[1:27:38] let's go on with him come on brothers
[1:27:40] musicians
[1:27:43] i hope you listen to what i'm saying
[1:27:46] because you see
[1:27:47] a preacher you don't realize what a
[1:27:49] preacher is
[1:27:52] and it's not what we choose to be
[1:27:56] that's why they're true preachers but
[1:27:57] there's false ones
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:04] if a preacher
[1:28:06] doesn't strive to know
[1:28:09] the things that has been spoken of by
[1:28:12] the prophet that seems to be
[1:28:13] contradictory
[1:28:15] to one another and he does not strive to
[1:28:18] have an understanding to teach his
[1:28:20] people he's not concerned with his
[1:28:22] people he's only concerned with getting
[1:28:24] the collection plate when it passes by
[1:28:26] working now the money
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:32] i've spent my whole life
[1:28:35] studying this message
[1:28:40] to where the things that seem to be
[1:28:42] contradictory
[1:28:44] are beautiful pictures once they unfold
[1:28:49] but until they unfold they're horrible
[1:28:52] like a cap and a tree
[1:28:55] eating green grass
[1:28:58] you see why i spend my time for that
[1:29:01] for you
[1:29:04] to help you understand
[1:29:09] these things have always been to me like
[1:29:11] daniel 70 weeks and things
[1:29:14] he said we don't need to understand
[1:29:16] brother brown said if you don't
[1:29:17] understand daniel 70 weeks you cannot
[1:29:19] understand the seal that's what he said
[1:29:22] now i'm not the one that made that
[1:29:24] statement you go in the message
[1:29:27] of the daniel 70 weeks and you'll find
[1:29:29] what he says on that
[1:29:33] if we're not interested in getting out
[1:29:35] of here in a change of the body what are
[1:29:36] we interested in
[1:29:40] you know what do we need what are we
[1:29:41] here for
[1:29:42] you know that somebody's here to prove
[1:29:44] to satan may i quote it
[1:29:46] that she will not fall like eve
[1:29:49] did in the garden
[1:29:52] well she won't fall for his subtility
[1:29:54] let's stand she won't fall for his
[1:29:56] deceiving triggering tactics
[1:30:01] his reasonings and
[1:30:03] memory of conscience and affections and
[1:30:07] things that she won't fall for that
[1:30:13] she will believe god's word what we got
[1:30:14] brother
[1:30:32] my
[1:31:00] for the needs that our brother's asking
[1:31:04] and we wait on you to bring forth a
[1:31:07] manifestation

[1:32:07] we've got to go
[1:32:22] i feel the pool
[1:32:37] he's had this old congestion and things
[1:32:39] and
[1:32:40] just wave all of us you go through two
[1:32:42] or three
[1:32:43] rounds of antibiotics trying your best
[1:32:44] to help and that still ain't doing no

[1:32:57] you
[1:32:58] lord we love you and we thank you
[1:33:01] in jesus name
[1:33:06] see why is it now that it's in the
[1:33:08] respiratory of what you call it the life
[1:33:10] system
[1:33:11] it's in the breathing
[1:33:14] it's in the
[1:33:16] bronchus
[1:33:19] trying to cut the life off
[1:33:26] he's trying to stop us
[1:33:29] he knows he has just a little season
[1:33:31] please
[1:33:37] why because that's where it started at
[1:33:39] was when the breath of life was breathed
[1:33:41] into mankind
[1:33:44] so he's trying his best to fight that
[1:33:46] breath of life
[1:33:48] that living that breathing
[1:33:51] and it's horrible
[1:33:53] to when you get where you can't breathe
[1:33:58] it's rough it's
[1:34:00] it's horrible
[1:34:03] thank god for things to
[1:34:05] open our sinuses whatever you call it
[1:34:06] doing happiness
[1:34:09] thank god for it
[1:34:12] because we believe it

[1:34:22] loved everybody and thank you very much
[1:34:25] so sister mary
[1:34:27] happy birthday

[1:34:35] just pray for these that are sick
[1:34:37] satan with the doings and and all and
[1:34:39] tying up and trying to stop everybody
[1:34:41] but we know who has the truth right
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:46] think on these things
[1:34:50] what about it
[1:34:54] we're facing eternal life
[1:34:59] the very thing that mankind fell from in
[1:35:01] the garden
[1:35:03] he didn't make it to it
[1:35:05] but somebody will
[1:35:09] why
[1:35:09] because jesus christ did
[1:35:15] he was in a mortal body
[1:35:17] subject to death
[1:35:19] his body was not eternal
[1:35:22] he was in that mortal part
[1:35:25] yet he come to a change

[1:36:02] to have that atonement for our lives as
[1:36:04] long as we're here mortals
[1:36:07] and then when we're out of here and not
[1:36:08] mortal anymore we don't need an
