there a better place for you to go right now you need to go on out the door not trying to be mean if there's a better place that you think you need to be you need to go out that door right there cuz right here is where God's going to talk to us right here today in this Temple he's going to take your Tabernacle and he's going to use that Tabernacle to speak to your Tabernacle and if it's the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to always come together are you going to be the most uncomfortable person that ever lived on the face of this Earth and I hope you are cuz I became you know I

bless you brother I see him right now amen I you should be able to see him in each and every one of us this morning if he's living in our hearts that was his plan to cond in sin down from an invisible God to visibility am to tangibility am amen I like it amen makes me feel good because now we know what life's purpose really Isen God bless you this morning um I'm I'm just real pleased and it's a real pleasure and a real privilege to be in the house of God with each and every one of you and um I can't think of a better place to be unless we were all over on the other side and we were given testimony of what God has done for us amen now of course this is we're here this morning to honor the resurrection and of course it is the anniversary of uh the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we just want to ask the Lord to help us this morning Amen to be able to come to a conclusion uh I didn't I didn't say this before but it it h it has been said in the previous two uh Services by uh comments that were made and that is that our purpose the reason why we're here is the conclusion of the whole matter it really is God is good all the time amen love him with all my heart we're just going to get right into the message if that's okay I still want you to go to Romans chapter 8 we're going to read verse 11 uh I'm going to start out this morning uh again on something in the Bible that took place on Friday night before the crucifixion so that we can really come to an understanding of what or who was really crucified right amen amen the the world celebrates it as as a man and we of course keep the Hoffman's head at 33 uh painting a copy of it there because the prophet of God said that in all the different places that he'd seen him that's the that's the the artist that captured uh pretty much what he looked like when he was a man here on Earth and uh today there is a celebration of course uh around the world uh Easter and and uh they they they they focus so much on the man that they forget about God we're interested in God in the man amen now I believe that was the god man yeah I believe that was the vessel that God used that God created that God brought into existence so that he could fulfill his plan to live amongst his attributes his children which are you and I we're going to find out this morning what really was crucified on Calvary it was not just a man amen that's right amen Romans 8:11 listen careful now watch this scripture but if the spirit now that's a capital S but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead now watch careful it doesn't say but if the word of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it says but if the spirit he that raised up Christ from the dead now I thought they were one and the same and they are but the word Christ is used so that God can separate himself from one being into many Christ is the anointing or the anointed one or the anointed ones he that he raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken that means make Alive Now activate give life to your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you father we thank you Lord this morning for your grace and your mercy I I pray Lord that you'd help me now Lord as we go through your word father and find the places Lord where you are revealing to us Lord where we came from who we are and our final destination Lord help us all I pray Lord let life activate itself in the hearts of the Believers Lord let this Spirit Quicken that body word Lord that's laying within us father so that we also Lord can not just have that life but become that life Lord amen that's your perfect plan this morning Lord we yield and surrender to you and we'll always be careful to give you all the honor and the glory and the praise in the precious and Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may be seated now he did hang on Calvary for three hours so that you would not have to sit here and suffer me to preach three we I it's okay Paul said if I could just deliver five words of understanding just five I will have accomplished more than all of the unknown tongues that come into existence is that right so let me start out like this if you would now if it's all right we're we're we had Sunday school but I feel like we're still in Sunday scho school this morning and uh we we want to cover some scriptures uh I have right here in front of me what I'd like to read out of the message of the hour if it'll just stay illuminated for me uh I I haven't come uh to the place in my life where I am a gadget guy but I do like uh the the things that make life easier um and and make life better for us uh most of the time uh they become a distraction uh and and and and Satan is the god of distraction uh but we don't care it's like the automobile we use it because it came into existence and uh it's faster than walking it gets us to where we need to be you can live much further away from your from your place of worship or your place of work than you used to be able to live uh in times past you had to live at least a uh horse and bug uh distance or walking distance away now they come from the East and West they come from a land afar amen so I thought maybe I'd start out real real and I and I'm I'm a simple guy I love God's word now now we we we receive God God delivers himself in Simplicity is that right but God himself is certainly far from what we would consider to be simple he's the creator of all that exist and of course science Tres is confounded by the fact that um they can't come to an understanding of of Where it All Began they are looking for it uh and and they will never find it in the way that they're looking because now now remember something about science it does require a certain amount of Faith because they're they're they're they're employing themselves to look into areas that uh are without understanding and they're trying to figure out how to get there now I'll tell you this as I've said it before the word of God is how you do it but you still have to put your faith in the word of God all right so I would like for you to turn to begin this morning's lesson to St John chapter 18 now the more that I um uh indulge in the word of God I'd say study but and it does say to study yourself to be approved the more I indulge in God's word the more I find out that um The Book of John is the very reason why that he was chosen by God to go out on the aisle of Patmos and be used as what we call John the Revelator because John's character and makeup um uh seemed to have a particular way about itself and he uh he by his Simplicity remember he he was the um the disciple that always was always seen laying sort of in the bosom you know uh either Jesus was always hugging him to hang on to him or he was always hugging Jesus to get something from him it work both ways you know you wouldn't think that Jesus needed a prop but he was he was a man he was somebody the character of Love who who who wanted to express and extend that love um and very few people understood that at the time he was here it was like brother Dutch saying that on Friday night that the that the disciples and all the followers of Jesus and I'll say it like this perhaps just 120 who made it to the upper room now think about Jesus was God In the Flesh he wasn't just a a preacher or a prophet he was God In the Flesh and at the end of his life and all of the sermons that he preached and and the love that he projected and and all of the profound statements that he made there were only 120 people who somehow caught the essence that this must be more than a man there's something more to him than just a fellow walking through the streets of Galilee and we probably ought to put our faith of what little or what much we have in what he said 120 now I'm not good at guessing numbers there must be 60 80 100 here this morning now so we're almost to the size of the entire class that ended up that's why that's why fear not little flock that's why the prophet said it would at the end it would just be a small amount of people now you know that I I say this to my church cuz we're not we're we're we're only a third of the size maybe of what you've got here in in membership and and and some and some ministers take those statements that brother Brandon made like fear not little flock out of the scripture and and that it would be a small group and that you'd be the my own n and and they try to enforce that you know what I mean by that they try to keep the group small by rubbing people the wrong way I mean can I use a phrase ticking them [Laughter] off okay I know I'll bet and people get all see they think they're fulfilling the scripture by doing that I don't agree with that it's to whosoever will as many or as few would come but I'm I'm I'm I'm seeing the this morning something that that I I I would like to convey to you to start and that is really really did they crucify a man or were they trying to silence the god in the man so you got St John 18 they couldn't silence the God and the man so they had to get rid of the man but what they didn't realize is you can't kill God so God said I'll show them they'll try to silence me but I'm not going to be silenced that's right I'll continue to work amen through the same vessel that they thought they were going to silence me through I will raise it up from the dead I will reenter that vessel and I will continue to use that vessel that's right brother amen amen so if you got St John 18 lots of places to start from and I think maybe verse 28 if you're okay with that Jesus brought before Pilate would that be okay then LED they Jesus from caiaphus under the Hall of judgment now where does judgment begin judgment according to St Peter Begins the house of God and it was early and they themselves went not into the Judgment Hall do you know why because they didn't want to it's going to say this L they should be defiled right why wouldn't they want to go into the place where God said judgment begins because they were self-righteous and they did not think they had any impediments that required for them to go into the Judgment Hall and if they in fact were seen going into the Judgment Hall as you are seen coming into the house of God this morning people might think oh they must have something wrong with them on I got lots of things wrong with me so I throw myself at the mercy of the court of God's word so that I can be watch now loved yes by God Amen what are you saying brother judgment and love judgment begins at the house of God and the prophet of God said love is corrective always now correction does not always mean punishment that's right see we equate it with punishment because when dad takes you to the Woodshed he isn't going out there to sit on a stump and talk with you he's meeting out punishment because we're in a body of Flesh am still with me verse 28 now but that they might eat the Passover 29 pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man they answered and said unto him if you were not a malactor what does that mean that means a bad character okay we would not have delivered him up unto thee then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the Jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to what a pack a hypocrite they were bringing him to a place where they knew that their own judgment and Justice would be Meed out upon this man and that the penalty would be death Hypocrites do we know anybody like that the world is in this condition right now yeah and it's all leading up to one thing amen the demise of true Christianity not Christianity the way the world wants it to be painted I just read a headline come across my phone a week ago where the pope who is considered by the world the head of Christianity and he had the audacity to make this statement that Ramadan and I'm not against the Muslim communities is important to Christianity no it's important to the pope because he is going to be you don't see in the in in in the world we live in right now you don't see much about the pope well it happens to be because the man that's in the office right now is not the man that's going to do the the deed no that man that they call Pope whatever his name in is not the man because God sent a prophet and that Prophet Prophet told us and I believe what that Prophet said he said that that Pope that would cause the world to go into the tribulation is coming out of the United States did you know that did you have you read that and you say well no the the the the the board of the committee that's going to select and elect the next Pope or the next three popes they got nobody on the list he don't need to be on their list he's on God's list let's keep reading amen cuz I'm going to take my time is that okay but it won't be 3 hours don't you worry about that goe all right it is not lawful for us to put any man to death verse 32 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die then pilate see they were fulfilling prophecy then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews now watch it gets it gets a little thick right here Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it right yeah does that ring a bell who do you say I the son of man am well some say you're this and some say you're that and some say you're there some say you're the prophet some say yeah but I want to know who you think who you believe what Revelation you personally have of who I am that's really what he's asking pilot okay watch now pilate answered wrong answer yeah it wasn't Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God it's am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight yep that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence you mean his servants actually would have fought for him if this world was his kingdom well I can tell you that the Bible says that Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and Satan and his angels right so there is a battle going on it's been going on since the beginning of creation creation is when God brought something out of nothing yes he brought something out of an eternal being and brought it down into time time began as soon as creation began because this God we serve and please don't try to figure this out you will go insane he had no beginning right the human being says well he had start somewhere that's the human being right that's right they didn't crucify him for being a good man no they didn't right they crucified him watch now for being an instrument in time that an eternal being existed in amen that's right without without beginning right and Without End every child of God whether you realize it or not this morning had no beginning oh no brother I was born December 11th 1956 at such and such a time that's my birthday but there was was something about me about you something that that that brought you into existence we're always looking back at it the other way yeah right what brought us into existence did you know that the prophet of God said that the gene germ of Levi was was activated in Abraham but he was a great grandson but the germ was activated in Abraham how how in the world were did you get here through your ancestry when we know that the germ of life that produced you came from your father it was because Abraham simply paid tithes and that tithe pay that would eventually reach the priesthood of Levi down through several Generations was the activation of The Germ of Levi now that's the natural come on now what we want this morning is the activation of that e Eternal germ yes yes sir you say Well it had to start somewhere the spoken word is the Original Seed the word seed means beginning did you know that yeah right if you read in Genesis you find out that the first thing that came into existence watch it now was not light oh brother I got it right here in Genesis but did you read the scripture and God said let there be light so before light there was sound there was a voice there was a something that came out of something and spoke and right there sir The Original Seed came into existence now remember something and I've probably preached this here before but it's okay some of you don't know me I'm going to give it to you the way that God has given it to me do you all believe that Adam came from God if Adam came from God then Adam was eternal Adam had watch watch watch had eternal life what do you mean he had eternal life you just told us that if you are are God's son or daughter that you never had a beginning that's right see I wanted this morning take the time to Define what was really crucified like I was beginning to say last night the real me the real you brother Louise is not the man I see it's not even the man I hear it's not the man I pay attention to there's another you in there am amen he's the one you go to bed at night with he's the one you keeps secrets from all your he's the one who knows that whether you did right or wrong he he he's she or he it's the person okay so remember in Genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness we are told and believ that that was a spirit man because it was made in the image of God and I believe it's in St John 4:24 where it says God is a Spirit come on amen now you cannot kill and you cannot crucify a spirit spirits come into existence of course and can be taken out of existence but you cannot crucify a spirit amen so I take this piece of paper and brother Lis okay if I use you for an example you see I'm going to use brother Louise this morning as not the Fallen Adam but Adam the Son of God how's that amen now this piece of paper represents eternal life a portion of God like the lick of fire the lick of fire that fell on the day of Pentecost and came into the hearts of the Believers was a portion of the Eternal being of God but being represented in the lick of fire so that it could be seen it could be identified it could be talked about it could be written down about it could be conveyed but how are you going to convey a spirit here I'm going to convey a spirit right now that's God's spirit right there right now Adam had eternal life and that eternal life was based on one premise and that premise was keep my word amen so therefore if you have to keep his word in order to maintain eternal life his word and his life are one now when Adam chose to save a part of himself which we call Eve he had to make a decision that's right amen and that decision was do I give up what God has given me to save her or do I let her go am M yeah Adam being a Son of God Adam having a portion of God had a revelation what was his Revelation I'm going to lay my life down oh because I have a representation that's going to raise it up again may I have that brother Louise I know you don't want to give up your eternal life but it's only temporary it only it lasted less than three days when God decided I'm G to I'm going to make myself the perfect example now brother Bram said that when Adam partook of the forbidden fruit to save Eve's life it was Christ so the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you abely it will it and and you don't realize it brothers and sisters maybe but the preaching of the word is the quickening power not because it's the letter on the page not because it's a repeating of what someone else said but because it's Life coming through a vessel and then conveying a word from God that activates the seed inside of you and say I see that that's it that's life I didn't know when I was lost and undone in the world brother Donnie that there was something inside of me that was crying and groaning and wishing for something better yes but I would sit down with a can of beer and a and a and a marijuana cigarette and sit there and say is this it I had friends that did the same thing and I don't remember any of them sitting down and saying is this it right oh Lord what was it in me what was it in you come let me finish the scripture let me get to a point you still here Jesus answered my kingdom verse 36 is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then will my servant servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jes I don't see how got that question out of that answer are thou a king then yeah Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king listen you mean by a question just the very fact Jesus knew just the very fact that this was permeating inside of pilate art thou a king thou has said no I didn't say that I asked you the question revealed to Jesus that pilate knew but he was unwilling to admit right because pilate also was a man of authority amen all right but I'm going to get down to this part thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth amen everyone that is of the truth watch now heareth my voice why because the spoken word is the original seed and the Original Seed is truth and pilate goes on and says what is truth did you realize right there indicates to us they were crucifying the truth because they didn't want the truth that's right I looked up the word truth and it says actuality fact Fidelity which is similar to Faith or faithful right [Music] and constancy like constant comes from the root of true the word true and true means ideal essential consistent typical steadfast loyal honest just legitimate rightful and accurate so really really the confusion for for pilot was what is essential what is ideal see he's asking what is truth what is consistent what is typical what is steadfast what is loyal see these are the the definition we'd say synonyms but the definitions of Truth and he says what is truth he didn't have a clue that's right what is honest what is just what is legitimate what is rightful what is accurate do you know where the word true came from now this is not a pun or a play on words but the very root of the word true comes from the word tree that's what my dictionary said same one you all can use the Miriam Webster and I saw that and I said brother Donnie I'm G to tell you what came to me yeah two trees amen what looks like two truths amen Jesus said if you're of the truth you will hear me he says what is truth I don't [Music] understand that's because of the two trees am he that heareth my word yeah he that believeth truth that would be those that came from the Tree of Life those that are asking the question like Pilate would have have to emanate it from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you see how how how how there's a contrast now there's a contrast right prophet of God speaks about that without contrast if there wasn't a a bad one we wouldn't know what a good one was he uses the word bad woman did you know that what's the woman at type of thank you so if there wasn't a bad one yeah we wouldn't know what a good one was how do we identify what a good church is depends on where you came from very simple so let me go here with you what is truth well let's just get back to the basics God is a spirit now God g o d the word god is an object of worship the the word god D listen now is not Eternal the word God the spirit that brought that word into existence is eternal right but he needed to to come out of an invisible world that nobody could see right that nobody could compreh Rend and begin to condens him down in such a way where the plan that he had so he could fellowship with his children his attributes could come about amen believe that that's what they crucified am right they crucified the idea of God wanting to fellowship with himself through his attributes they thought they could silence it they thought they could bring it to an end but they did not comprehend the truth if they would have just gone back before pil before Pilate would have brought Jesus he should have said um uh we're going to we're going to put him on a retainer uh I'm going to let him out on bail I'm gonna let him out on his o his own recogniz and then I'm G to do a little background check here and then I'm going to then I'll make a judgment based upon that and if he would have just went back into the Book of John just a little further Jesus said I am the way the truth he wouldn't have had to have asked the question what is truth he was truth he was the way he was life and if he would have just read that simple scripture pilate and came to a revelation of what was being convicted he would have not crucified him and delivered him up yes why because he's life you can't kill that amen amen so brothers and sisters there's something inside of us this morning if we've been born again of the word seed of God and the spirit of God has come down on that and activated there's something in us that says he in me is the power to lay this life down now what is eternal life what is it it's living for others and in order to live for others something's got to die what's got to die you and me got to die to live for others oh no brother I want to keep it for myself or to myself I don't have enough to give out then you're from the wrong side of the tracks amen cuz this is life amen yeah and I'm not going to make anybody in here feel bad this morning but I want you to ponder this do you have eternal life do you live for others I'm not talking about a grandma living for her granddaughter oh that's right brother that's easy yeah right I'm talking about you and I doing things outside of our normal circle like I have need to go to Samaria well what are you going to Samaria for we need groceries we're going to go shopping that's really what the disciples were going to do go buy food he said you go get the natural food I got some other groceries I got to deliver I'm going to take it down to the well because I know by being God manifest In the Flesh that there is one of mine over at the well and she's pondering her life right now you've had five and the one you're with is not yours how in the world did that guy know that how did he know that I was sitting on my front porch now that's right pondering my own life amen H there's more to us than meets the eye I can tell you that right now right and I'm preaching to you on Easter wait till I get to the quote amen but I I want to just paint this picture so so easy easy it's not one of those pictures you know that's of the aspen trees like they do where I live and then you got to study it real close oh there's a deer in there there's an elk in there there's a mountain lion in there I never saw that before no this is plain yes in plain view so we realize that God's plan required him to begin to come down out of the invisible eternity that he dwelt in and he had to Institute time which by the way is our worst enemy it's fighting some of you right now man he's been up there for 20 minutes well I don't have a lifesaver and I don't have a button good but I love God's word it changed my life changed my life I didn't realize that there was a spirit of God until I listened to the word of God now remember something about a seed here I'll Pi pick this piece of paper I usually bring a big old avocado seed to the pulpit and the reason I do is because it's a large seed and you could see it and I like avocado so I ate whatever it was covering it okay that's why he said eat my flesh and drink my blood or you have no life in you right right but I'll use this piece of paper every seed listen carefully and we know that the spoken word is the Original Seed so I want to get every seed has a life in it and it is the life of the seed but without the spirit it just lays dormant it's got life in it it's got its own life in it but it lays dormant unless it comes in contact with the the way God ordained it to Spring forth that's why Romans 8 says if the spirit be in you that was the spirit that was in the man we know as Jesus who said I have the power to lay my life down for this cause came I into the world you tear this Temple down and in three days do you know when they were mocking and scourging and whipping and and and kicking and spitting on and pulling his a beard they were trying to destroy the temple right amen we see Jesus on these pictures in the cross and and of course he's pretty Haggard looking them the Mel Gibson thing that the brother talked about The Passion of the Christ I mean that's pretty horrible but the prophet of God told us you couldn't recognize him as a man even his ribs were sticking out of his skin and I know what that does the people that go oh my goodness that man gave his life but did you realize who was doing it yeah yeah you say it was God oh the spirit of God left Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane because the spirit of God can not die it's Eternal it had no begin it'll have no end so it had to remove itself from that body and that body was a human body in such a way where when he got to the Garden of Gethsemane as brother Dutch said and he saw what was [Music] coming he jumped and ran he gave up he said I can't do it he realized that the task was nearly insurmountable I don't think I can do it I want to do it but I don't think I can do it yeah but something way down yeah where did that come from the spirit of God had already left him where did that come from where did that thing we down on the inside of that man rise up and say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord not my will come on now not my will we know the prophet of God pointed out to us and it it's obvious that the death of Calvary happened in Gethsemane the actual event itself on the cross was just the follow through the repercussions of the battle Amen in the Garden of Gethsemane which all of us battle should I help them right or should I not right do I care or don't I I care does this matter or does this not matter and so on and so on and so on brothers and sisters but God has made a way for you and I to come through it all amen than Lord am don't let this shock you now but it's because he knew you amen I see the ministry from time to time began to discuss in different forums and platforms uh whether uh there was anything in you or not and I we have quotes to go both ways but what it boils down to is here's what's in you but you don't know it's in you because you're looking for something tangible you're looking for something through the telescope the microscope you're looking for something that you can get a hold of and you can't touch for knowledge that's right amen right you can't touch it God saw you that's what he's calling to come to him you don't need that tangibility in you you don't need that substance what you need is faith faith is the activator brother brandom said God when he said let there be light had to believe his own word he had to place faith in it why cuz he inst instituted the law of Faith that's the reason why brother Brown said many a street walker could come through the prayer line because of a a type of faith that they had and receive their healing and a good Sanctified godly woman would come to the line and get nothing that's right it's powerful how is that possible all things are possible amen see You've Got to Believe you've got to put all your confidence I'm going to say it like this you've got to pour all your life into what you believe and it matters what you believe amen amen so you want to put it in God's word right amen because God's word has God's life in it but it doesn't stop there that's why I reiterated to you in Romans but if the spirit and brothers and sisters a lot of us walk around through life with the seed of God in us but never allow it to be activated oh don't worry I'm not preaching to you Pentecost yeah there you go but I am preaching to you that that Malachi 4 says he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers not the denomination no but to the activation of the life that's the key now the seed that was meant for the people of the day we live in was the seed that God saved remember that the very first seed of any plant or tree I'll use the apple tree is that all right the very first seed that God ever planted of the first Apple Tree had every Apple Tree in it after that it had every Apple it had every seed it had every leaf it had every lamb it had every root you catch that we can see that what about when God plants the seed when God planted the seed that was him it had every son and daughter that would ever come that's why he said the first shall be last and the last shall be first because the first seed that was planted had all of God in it after that it began to Blossom and Sprout with the life of God but the Original Seed is where it all came from and we are taught by the prophet that in the day you and I live in we're back first shall be last and the last shall be first where did God keep this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he kept it in the back part of his mind Moses didn't realize it at the time because he didn't live in the time you and I did but when he wanted to see God and God showed him his back God was showing him the beginning that seed was there Moses was was in God at the beginning but Moses in time was not produced at the beginning do you realize that the Fall In the Garden of Eden and what Satan did through the serpent was Satan believing in himself so much that he could plant an alternative seed mix it and come forth yeah listen now as Christ y sure where did he where did he miss it The Germ come from the mail yeah right amen the field is the church right amen that's why when the prophet of God came in the 20th century his battle was to get the field to see stop that seed stop that seed stop that seat stop don't take that don't take that don't take that here here's the original seed take this take this take this amen that's correct and we realize Through the Ages that many many many people and again brother Bram I I can quote you he said they're not lost don't say they're lost goes back to Martin Luther and John Wesley and so forth they're not lost he said they played their part but there is a time where there is a people who will not accept anything but all the word of God they will cast down their reasoning they will cast down everybody else's reasoning and and it doesn't watch now it doesn't make you an isolationist no it doesn't right brother that's what a lot of people end up though oh yeah all by themselves out there on that island you've heard me say it before you know the guy that was Shipwrecked and they finally came to rescue him years and years later one guy on the island I know it I Ed the one about get your own dirt they finally show up years later and there's three Huts three little huts on the island hey I thought you were shipwreck by yourself well I am what's that over there he says that's where I live he says what's that he says that's my church what's this other little Hut that was my church before I built that one was my former church he didn't even get along with himself and that's what some of the problem we just don't get along with oursel that's why the word of God through the message of the hour is to inform you is to reveal to you is to give you a personal revelation of Who You Are by where you came from because once you know and are convinced that you came from God then you do have the power amen that's right brother through that Revelation Amen to lay your life down now we're thinking of the tomb of death of Calvary of crucifixion oh he said take up your cross he didn't say take take up your cross and nail yourself to it and die like me he said take up your cross Follow Me Right amen ain't God good so we realize that I'm watching the clock I don't know leave it alone I'll finish my thoughts that I have on this page only only got one one and a half pages of notes you're good but I like inspiration I like notes I like I I I I admire the men that can get them gadgets and they can just and they got their message down there and they scroll up and they can see that and they but that's not me God is a spirit amen is that right amen now if we would turn to our Bibles everybody knows these scriptures I'm going to read them I know the brothers put them up on the board St John 1 verse one amen let's start there and we're and and really I I you know the title of my message is resurrection by representation well let's see what really was crucified and what really resurrected of course the man rose from the dead but that man was busy working while everybody thought he was dead right as I mentioned yesterday it was the seventh day that he was doing that work and denominationalism and the thought of denomination and how many knows what the word denomination means really do you really know I'm going to tell you what it means now brother Wade do you carry any who's got a dollar a $5 bill a 10 give me a hundred no that that would be the wrong kind of evangelism if somebody's got a bill in their pocket thank you brother that's all I need see he's he a good man he gave me one and that's because George Washington's on that's right now now the word denomination brother now how many knows the the older folk in here are going to know this some of you young people are going to learn something today this is a denominational note did you know that's what this is called now it has nothing to do with church but it is called a denominational note what is the denomination of this note we say it's $1 but where they got the word denomination from if you break it down in Latin is the value of a name so they put George Washington worth a buck right you say wait a minute he was the first president he was the that's right it's number one he was the first president he was probably one of the greatest presidents but they knew that more people would have the $1 bills than Andrew Jackson's the common people would be more likely to have this note than the 50 or the 100 especially back in time when that was like a million dollars this is a $1 denominational note so what it means is the value to the Federal Reserve of George Washington is a buck you know why I said all that because it's the value of a name where do denominations start from they start from man who puts a lot of emphasis and and and a lot of authority a lot of respect and so forth on somebody and that somebody can die that don't stop the spirit Martin Luther died and boom the Lutheran Church come up John Wesley died in the Methodist Church come up uh uh brother Seymour from the isua street Mission died that didn't stop the Pentecostal movement but what is the difference between a denomination and true Eagle Christianity it's based on one man but that one man is not conveying his thoughts he's conveying the thoughts of God and that's what they crucified they thought they could silence God's voice look at the world we live in why do you think there's coming an attack on Christianity because they know Satan knows they have no clue they're just minions they're just being used by Satan to be raised up in a certain thought process to stop Christianity because Christianity is the only hope yes am not denominational Christianity true Eagle Christianity because it emanated from a source they cannot touch only you and I as believers who are willing to submit and subject ourselves to it have access amen I'll tell you what I could I could dance a little bit if I didn't have an artificial knee I'd get crazy but I don't want another one so I'm afraid but I'll I I'll have to get another one yeah have you ever seen uh uh one of them their YouTube videos of them replacing a knee they jump on top of you with a sludgehammer and a chisel and a wrench and they separate the lower leg from the upper one they drill holes in your bone marrow and they take something that looks like a rebar brother Donnie and they glue it down in there the bottom of the top and then they connect this stainless steel um ball to it I was in more pain watching then I was participating and sometimes that's the way it is think about it our mind goes to a certain place oh I I can't do it if it's possible let this cup pass for me that was way more painful now you say well no Calvary was in the man it was way more difficult once he became satisfied that that was his portion of of of God's work for him said thy will yeah let thy will be done amen but remember something the word God God and object of worship was brought into existence because before that we are known he was known as what we call Elohim the self-existent one a lot of folks and a lot of churches and a lot of Ministries try to maintain Elohim it's us or nobody that's not the way God operates he says it's me and everybody it's us let us make man you know I'm not going to read it to you but you go a little bit below what is truth and you'll find out that pilate said behold the manen that was the man that was produced by genesis6 and7 that's right God was a thought can you see my thoughts I can't see yours and I can tell by the expression on some of your faces some good some IND different some bad but I don't know exactly what you're thinking you don't know exactly what I'm thinking so if I want you to understand or be able to comprehend and absorb and digest my thought that you cannot see I must speak now if I'm a liar my thoughts are lies amen if I'm a sinner my thoughts are sinful but if you've been born again the power of transformation begins to what by the r renewing of the Mind amen it begins to change somehow it begins to change the way you think now it's not in an instant the way you and I it's a lifetime of change it was Abraham walking for 25 years Abraham by proof of ishmail had what it took in his body to produce the promise but his church had not quite got there yet amen right thank at what point did Abraham's Church Sarah come to the conclusion that she could fulfill the promise she was changed in such a way where the Pharaoh said she's mine she hadn't looked in a mirror until she got into Pharaoh's Palace yeah right CU they had mirrors you know and she looked said whoa who is that this is the person that he wants for his wife Abraham get me out of here I've got wanted takes now to produce the promised son amen amen and God intervened don't touch her because if you even try you die amen God see is always he's in I like I I sister Regina I bet you could sing this for me he's an on time God yes he is he's an ontime God yes he is job said he might not be there when you want him to but he's always right on time cuz he's an on time God that's why we're here this morning did you realize that you are fulfilling the on time God so he as a thought as a spirit as the great mind we call him because we don't really know how else to express or explain it he began to speak speak and he said let there be and let there be and let there be now guess what the spoken word really is it is his son see we think of the human body as his son but if you'll go to First the Epistle of First John 5 what does it say there 1 John 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now in verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh so they thought they were crucifying the word Satan was motivating them to stop God come on you ain't going to stop God you ain't going to stop God's word but the carrier the conduit the vehicle that's right the one that God chose the conduit he chose in the 20th century was killed in a car accident Satan said I stopped it on Cal I stopped it he didn't stop nothing he just motivated he didn't realize but he just motivated he inspired here's what he did watch as I mentioned to you about Levi being activated in the loins of Abraham when that car accident took place what Satan did know is there was an activation of Life why because a corn of wheat abideth alone unless it falls into the ground and dies and if it dies and there is life in it it will bring forth after it's kind yes sir oh I see I I got a little Kickback right there oh well he's trying to be the prophet oh no I'm not trying to be the prophet no I'm not trying to be Jesus Christ no try amen he lives in here I'll tell you what we are did you hear me say it yesterday we are the burning bushen did you realize that and as the fire of God Burns in your heart perhaps there will be a Moses out there somewhere that will turn aside and say what do you got who did you say you were what do you believe I believe he's an ontime God yes he is believe he's good all the time I believe he saves by Grace yes sir listen now here's the part they leave out through faith that's right that's not the end of that scripture you are saved by grace through faith you must have a revelation of what the grace of God truly is and the grace of God is unmar favor how did we end up then brother Louise in the condition of Salvation if it was unmar favor and our neighbor who 10 times better than we are doesn't it's because of forn knowledge see forn knowledge is still here that's why it's looking forward that sees the past not looking back brother BR said a frog looks back and when a frog looks back he sees a tri in being right when a child of God looks forward they see God you know I believe this now it's not a Doctrine it's just the way I feel that this new telescope the James web super telescope is sent out there one million miles one million miles out in space and it's static and it's sending out and it's receiving and it's taking pictures it's looking around what are they looking for if you'll read in Christ is revealed in his own word right where brother Brandon mentions Einstein on the next page he says now they they they're going to take the and they're going to look out out there and they think they're looking a 100 million light years or so out there he says and they're going to find out they're just looking at the backs of themselves but that's what the mechanical lie that took the picture of the pillar of fire but the pillar of fire itself is the life not the picture so what God wants you and I to do is become the activated germ seed of God to produce his word in its season and the season right now is Rapture and Rapture has requirements it requires a change of the body now those people that have gone on before us are waiting for the resurrection what I want the bride of Christ to realize today through the preaching of the word of God and the quoting of it and the understanding and revelation of it is the resurrection lays in you if you are in end time on time seat of God and they are and they are rooting for you because they without us cannot be made perfect oh when they went beyond the curtain of time they they they seem like they was perfect oh no they was lacking something they were they didn't eat they didn't drink didn't get tired brother Bram said they didn't have the feeling that you and I have he hugged them sisters and no there was no sensation amen but when a son and daughter of God hug each other it's like yeah you know what I mean don't you fellas be hugging no ladies now except your wife you know what I mean right don't get the wrong idea but you understand when I when I hug a brother it's like doesn't it we got this amen and then three brothers get together and pray in the room we got this and then Six Brothers get together and hold hands and begin we got this what a fellowship what a joy Divine leaning on the Everlasting Arms what a blessed peace what a joy is mine amen amen you want to finish it went from the thought of God in the beginning was the word now listen I want you to go to the the the if you care to to First John that's the Epistles of John just previous to the Book of Revelation you all know these scriptures but I just want to put the puzzle together today so that those of you who have not seen this picture before can go h i better sit down and consider this maybe we ought to look a little deeper into this amen yeah 1 John 5 verse 7 says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father watch now the word so there's where we know that the word is the Son and it's the s o n by by by the characteristic of a spirit that can't be seen which is the father investing itself into an entity that can be tangible that's the word and then the Holy Ghost most people don't realize is the author of the word so the Holy Ghost watch now authored the son yeah right what is the Holy Ghost it's the office of God whereby he is not fulfilling the invisible spirit and he is not indwelling in the word he is himself amen think about it yes okay I am a triing being you're a triing being I am a father cuz I have children I am a son because I have a father and I'm me the me part in type is the Holy Ghost why would people be afraid of the Holy Ghost it's because they've been taught through psychology and education and Academia that you could be somebody else yeah yeah yeah but God's word teaches you who you really are that's right and and and and in closing that's what the world is trying to crucify they're not crucifying Jesus Christ again they're crucifying the Son of God in the form of the word they want to stop that word why why does Satan want to stop that word why did they try to kill why did Cain kill label why did they try to kill the children in the days of Moses why did they try to kill the children in the days of Jesus why are they killing children today is because Satan is trying to stop that last seat he was trying to stop the original seat Jesus Christ came busted down the door and said I'm him give me those keys you're done but what Satan didn't no nobody is 2,000 plus years were going to have to go by so that God's plan could fulfill itself not just in the Sun but in his bride and we were in him that's why in the image of God these two shall be one both male and female so they're really trying to crucify watch now watch the world in its Spirit watch how they're trying to achieve attack the children born or unborn y through the woman y right because Satan reads the prophecy in Genesis and says it's a woman's seed I'm GNA stop the woman's seed dummy yeah I'll tell you right now Fred Sanford said you a dummy yeah my wife squ don't said don't before I was saved I grew up in front of a television that's right I'll tell you what my first message I ever preached was called Rock of Ages I come out of rock and roll brother Donnie and I could see the inspiration I'm telling you the inspiration of God on gifted men who went astray y Amen in my generation it was John linen gifted wrote music that got millions of people to be drawn in with simple phrases brother like she loves you yeah yeah yeah help I need somebody think about it see the that was those were gifts being misused that's right brother amen for the wrong Glory yes why wouldn't we be willing to accept the gifts that God would use for his glory I believe I heard several of them before a service up here singing and worshiping but the hardest thing for God to do did you know there was something hard for God no brother nothing but the hardest thing nothing's too hard for God but the hardest thing for God to do is to get one mortal man to believe another because you're all sitting out there going you guy's no better than me no I'm not I'm chiefest or I'm I'm the guy under Paul Paul said he's chiefest I can't take anything away from Paul yeah right brother Brenham said he taught what Paul taught there shouldn't be any question when you read something Paul said that's it no well brother brandom changed it over he didn't change nothing he magnified many things because that's what we're doing today we're not changing the gold into silver we're just polishing the gold so you can see your reflection in it the James web super telescopes mirrors are made out of gold the most reflective and conductive item we know of oh what a conductor what a reflection amen and here's the beautiful thing brother Donnie about God's word and us as his children when we look into the gold of God's mirror yep we don't see ourselves but like Sarah looking in Pharaoh's mirror we see a change individual right brother amen I'm not what I want to be right and I'm not what I ought to be but I surely ain't what I used to be but at some point that saying now that saying is going to come to an end in the days of ananas and saf it will there will only be one kind of believer in the church now there's three kinds but at some point in time there will only be and and and and and they might be just dragging themselves like carrying their cross sure and sometimes they need a little help yeah sure that's Jesus need a little help carrying his cross he just couldn't his physical body just couldn't make it he just he was 120 pounds probably by the time he got to Calvary 110 collapsed but he's an ontime God Simon how he didn't think he didn't consider the consequences he knew the Romans were kicking and scourging and mocking and beating and and stabbing and pushing and shoving the people out of the way didn't stop Simon right God is good amen in closing it went from a thought to a word which is the Son and now it has become manifest In the Flesh they couldn't they couldn't crucify the word they could only pervert it they could not stop God they could not kill a spirit they cannot see or touch so they picked on the vehicle don't feel bad amen when you picked on that's right abely he carried the cross of the world on his shoulders and he rose from the dead we all know that the world's but what I want you to receive this morning is the resurrected Christ is in the building he's in the buildings and he's bringing together a mystical body which is the body of Christ as I heard brother Luise say and he's the head and if the head Rises the body Rises with it can these Dry Bones live amen right oned please stand man I did all that without even reading this quote that I want to read to you now here's the deal it's a long quote so I'm going to give you where I got it from if that's okay and then you can read it yourself but I'll start at paragraph 46 now notice he says the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that's why I picked the three subjects that's right that Jesus is raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living amen when it looked like he was in the Tomb on Saturday which was the seventh day God sent a messenger to the seventh Church age that began to prove to show and to tell that he was raised from the dead and and his name was William Marian brandham we do not believe he was God we believe he was of thy servants our fellow brothers but he was so close that John decided he might try to Bow Down and Worship Him in the Book of Revelation say don't do it right there's a quote and I believe it's in the patmas vision where brother Bram said they kick and knock you around today but he said somay they'll bow down at your feet and worship you right now we're not looking for worship ship we don't want self worship we don't want self-satisfaction what we want is is a living God Jesus is raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living he lives here he's in us I'll be with you even in you a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you under the end of the world now as Christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened from life from Death To Life by his spirit and if he haven't been quickened if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive that's why we say stay with the word stay with the word stay with the word because it is what is going to be quickened but don't you dare deny the spirit of God when it begins to rain down upon that seed now it rains upon the just and the unjust we can't help it if people go nuts right we can't help it if they act crazy we can't help it if they don't have this seed in them but the water is watering what's in them that's the anointed ones at the end time it's the true anointing it's the true rain but what it falls on is what's going to make the difference and Let Me Tell You Folks something when the seed of God through the word of God is living in you which is the Son of God and the spirit comes down it will raise amen amen Christ that's it amen from the dead amen did you realize that's me and you yeah am part of that body sorry everybody's already standing nope let's pray Heavenly Father Lord yes we could continue to preach Lord for well for eons there's no stopping Point Lord in you you who have no beginning and has no end and Lord where we where we going to find a place to stop when what you have informed us of Lord through the preaching of the word through the delivery of the word and through the spirit falling on that word Lord that now we've come to that final office three Perfection it's the day of the Holy Ghost Lord we can't take the father and the son out because those were offices that the Holy Ghost itself filled which only can mean Lord that the Holy Ghost is the spirit that we called Elohim No Beginning No End and father we use the word self-existent one because we don't understand what it means Lord not to be in a beginning Lord we we began we we we believe we began Lord but the word of God through the presence of God through the spirit of God had no beginning you were speaking to your attributes Lord before there was even a molecule to live in but how Lord it had to be through the agency of your thoughts that's why they thought the prophet of God was a mind reader but he wasn't Lord he was being used by you and your forn knowledge to go through the land and cry out to the Rocks which became seeds which came forth began to produce the results Lord that you desired to see before anybody could see anything I pray you'd help us this morning Lord to recognize that the resurrection that happened 2,000 years ago or so Lord exists amongst us today in the hearts of your children Lord so difficult for us to comprehend father where it came from Nicodemus Lord had no idea that when Jesus said the wind comes and it goes where it wants to and you have no idea where it comes from that he was referring to a life and it's without question here this morning Lord that you have revealed yourself to us in the broadest sense Lord you've given us so much more than they've had in the past Lord It's the information age father because the information is available but it's not to be dissected Lord through the intellect is to be received in the heart because you said as we receive the word we become the word I pray father for each and every one in here this morning if there's one sick person Lord It's the Holy Spirit right now the healing virtue that in the beginning knew it was a Healer father that great Holy Spirit I pray now Lord that it would touch every body body Lord here or within the sound of our voice father anyone that's in need father of any kind Lord if they're being tormented if they're oppressed or depressed Lord if they're not sure who they are this morning Father Make Them sure Lord I pray let it be firm in their soul because we just want to give you the honor and the glory and the praise in the precious name the name given above every name the name that was concluded to be both Lord and Christ yes the name of Jesus Lord this morning I pray father for your honor and your glory in Jesus name amen go ahead brother Louis God bless you Happy Easter amen he is risen oh as this day this glor is day there's never been a day thank you there's never been a day like this day to me there's never been a day like this day I see I hope you can say that there's made a light that Shin so as the same his glory is there never been a day folks never been a day like the day you're stand right [Music] now been a day like this day I see there has never been a time that Shin bright as this day there's Glory amen now look at the advancement of man we talk about light I know when Dad was growing up and some of your older ones was growing up it was a little candle and he talks about doing his homework over we always call him a hurricane lamp it's just a little lamp with some kerosene in it it's got a little Wick in it and and you got to do your you got to do your your class lessons right there at it CU but it was light it was light then a little bit little bit longer there was a bul gave a little bit more light I know brother George remembers we used to go in those old houses and there'd be one light bulb hanging down and you couldn't see nothing 10 ft past that bulb well now we have led light that one little bitty pin light or a laser light or light the whole place up right well I hope that we know one thing for sure that same way with God Amen we could only see him by candle light but there was way more of him to see then there was a light bub came on hello somebody there was a light bub came on you got to see a little bit more now you get to see him in LED you get to see him in a light you've never seen him before yes and I hope when that light turn turns on you see Jesus Christ first but you're going to see him in your brother and your sister you're going to see him uh as as you most of you know that that go to church here I've been doing a series on the Statue of perfect man part 99 well we read that scripture in John 1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh most people most people their mind goes back to 2,000 years ago to that man yeah it started with that man but the word's being made flesh today in me and you that word that you took in today is going into your flesh and then your flesh is going to be motivated by what's inside you're either going to do right or you're going to do wrong it's whatever the motivating factor is so but good to have you each and every one of you here that let's give brother Chris another hand that was a that was a good load we sure appreciate it we sure appreciate brother Chris and appreciate his

pouring your uh heart out each and every one of you that sang preached and just walk through the door there's a lot of people didn't get up this morning right there's a lot of people millions of people in this SE 8 billion uh person World never saw the sun come up but I hope they saw the sun come up inside of them before the real sun came up that's what what I ask you today don't let the sun don't let the natural sun go down on you till you know that the spiritual part the sun the sun of God dwells in your heart cuz we're not guaranteed a day a breath a moment so this Easter Sunday reflect on one thing there had to be a death before there could be life and thank God for that you know it it would be good to to to to give you life for your kids or I'd give my life for brother Chris but you know what there's no there's nothing inside of me that's good enough that when I did die I could go into Chris and make him better one man can do that yes only one only one man had that kind of spirit inside of him that's what he's talking about Adam Adam thought he could save Eve well he didn't save her like that cuz he wasn't her savior he was a Son of God he could cover her he could protect her but he didn't save her there was only one savior one man the Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins yes sir being God Almighty in the human flesh he put that flesh aside but guess what he rose at the third day he came back out of that grave to do one thing go inside of his people and as brother Chris said to birth himself into his children there's only one man can do that and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and he's Eternal and if we connect oursel to that as old brother Ernie vill W Lord bless his soul may he rest he said we plugged oursel into the Eternal we got unplugged in the garden but we now by the new birth we got oursel plugged back into that Eternal strength that Eternal CT and that's what we live off of we live off of that power of his resurrection that we can have a resurrection the Bible tells us into newness of Life as we do in the baptismal service we resurrect in newness of life I pray that your life from now on will be new and that you'll think more about the Lord pray more study more have more of a fervor because uh I was telling him the other day brother Chris you people think we're strange and we isolate oursel we don't we just speak a different language if I went to you know if I went to China I'm not I'm not Chinese I don't speak I could learn it but I wouldn't learn it fluently as the person that spoke it from birth hello somebody spoke it from birth through birth we realize that we speak a different language right amen so we're speaking a different language now than the world speaks a different thought process that's why they didn't like Jesus that's why they didn't like the disciples it's because they were different but they were made different by what was inside of them and I was telling the other day brother Chris if you took 20 people out in the world just brought 20 people off the street set them in here today and let them listen to your sermon or any sermon with with Enlightenment or more light they'd think you're crazy what do you mean talking about a seed and talking about this and talking about that they just don't speak our language but I pray to God that that language would be so simple though that you'll be able to understand it the Common People heard his message gladly the Common People the dollar bill people not the $50 bill people the dollar bill people H him gladly so good to be here today thank you

of God being brought by soldiers of God that Lord knows what they're talking about Lord through you as Chris was talking about we're the only ones that truly know your mind because we went back in
