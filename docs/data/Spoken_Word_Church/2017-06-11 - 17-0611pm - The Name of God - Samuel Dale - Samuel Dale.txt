scriptures turn to proverbs 18 and we'll go to Exodus 6 proverbs 18 Exodus 6 number 6 remember to pray for Wade be coming back in Lord willing tomorrow night some of the others are away traveling so remember all of these and remember now that the brothers are to meet downstairs after the service to kind of say a few things or what we got to do or get set for the Father's Day banquet that we have they don't call it that up on the mountains when you're sitting back in the woods and nothing with you but I guess it is but remember that and then to announcement that sister Monica's and sister Rachel's Sunday school class will be practicing after the second service after the service remember that sister Monica and Rachel's Sunday school class will be practicing after the second service II meant to keep these things in mind okay proverbs 18 and Exodus 6 I miss any announcement and Anna's class with it yeah okay you know all the kids are brother Joe told me that sister Quinn wasn't feeling too good so she went home so reading over her and prayed the Lord would cut you okay anything else you have any father we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your love and to us thank you for all things and we just ask you to guide us and direct us that your understanding Lord would be with each and every one of us we pray that you would open our understanding today review yourself and push because without a revelation we're in when I've got a lot of problems but yet Lord we pray that you will review yourself because you promised it and that's what we can depend on you said you would do it so we just stand here in the last days and what you make yourself manifest among your people and we love you and we think you have your way as we read your word you come in speak to each one of us in Jesus name okay very familiar Scripture with everybody proverbs 18 verse 10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe let's go over now to Exodus chapter 6 and the Lord said unto Moses now see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand till he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of the land and God spoken to Moses and said unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and under Jacob by the name of Almighty God but by my name Jehovah was I'm not made known to them you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we want to talk about very simple talk very but I want to get into the Lord willing maybe Wednesday if not next Sunday we want to start kind of on the Godhead and this will get a few things out of the way to work that we can continue in to that point all right now I wrote myself a note for you to think about because anytime you talk about the name of the Lord of the name of God or whatever people's mind in the message will start relating to a new name well I wrote it like this don't worry about the new name until we can see that the name of God is Jesus why worry about a new name if you can't think about the name of God being Jesus all right now what is the name of the Lord we read there in the scriptures said the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and are safe what is the name of the Lord now how many gods do we believe in one true and living God right he has many manifestations he has many titles he has many ways of making himself known but there's only one true and living God he's oh no no we got to believe in the Father Son and Holy Ghost that's the way you make up one God without Father Son and Holy Ghost you don't have one God so don't run off to the oneness ideas and concepts and thoughts keep it in the right order because Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a name oh it's in the name of God well you can make anything of God you can make a book of God or this PN I mean this pulpit thing of God or or anything that you can think of because the word God simply means an object of worship right now so we'll get back into all of these things but I want you to think about it you see yeah but I've always just heard you know you said well what's the name of God's of God that you're not listening to the thought me your this meaning you're just picking up because of what you've been called all of your life you're not listening to understand you think you already have it in your understanding you think you got in English just go home and look up the word God you can be anything that you make between you and Almighty God all right now so then when you say the name God that's just a title and that's like Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human being right I'm a pastor of a church I retired from General Motors right you can bring up many titles relating to you but you only have one name now I'll make this statement over cuz I'm pretty sure it won't finish this afternoon but just remember if you have but one God you have but one name that should be sensible they shouldn't need a great big black book turn home you know mmm see then when you get into the scriptures and all then you won't follow the point of where that it uses many titles or many appoints huh now in Isaiah it was speaking of I believe is right now where it speaks of bringing forth the son you know the virgin he says you'll name him Emmanuel well you get over in the New Testament Matthew 'native what it will say in his name's you'll be called Emmanuel what didn't they call him Emmanuel run the Bible says to call him Emmanuel why did they not calling that they did when they named him Jesus because Emmanuel means cuz it was on to explain it there in Matthew in the scripture called his name Emmanuel which is by interpretation God with us but why didn't they call him Emmanuel you've got a lot of arguments among your church world systems and things that you've got names like Yahweh you got Jehovah you got Elohim you got all kind of names hava very flimsy it CV I think you got all kind of names now why would we be concerned that way when to show you simple little scriptures and things Jesus said I come in my father's name in that Scripture what's the father's name if his name was Jesus his father was Jesus no no that don't make sense got my little bear your name is Samuel and your son is Wade and Terrence and her daughter Anna you're not thinking we're not talking about like that jesus said I come in my father name and watch him and he said you won't receive me but said another coming their name he said you'll accept them Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal Brown tomate whatever you want to make them alright this will be serious about it and take out of your mind that don't be concerned about some form of a new name just hold on and let's talk about the name of Jesus but in doing that remember all the things and if you'll take a reference and run it backwards you'll run it all the way back through and it lacks to go back through the word Joshua it will go back into meaning Jehovah Savior is the name Jesus all right now so let's get the thoughts in our mind and just take it slow and easy because I want you to see something because you know you'd say well what do you mean his name is Jesus is that saying what somebody else says and we were illustrating this morning or is it saying something that you have experienced of that night is it a revelation to you that his name is Jesus alright asking you simple questions up front I asked the question one time and I know it's not too popular because it awakened out and I was starting to try to bring forth the series years ago and everybody was talking about son of man this is back in the 80s and you know son of man son of man son of man and I asked a simple question I said when I say son of God what is the first time if you think of in the Bible or expressing it is you come forth the son of God I said I said write it down I said just record it and hold it to that point even if I say it now what is it when I say son of God what do you think about then I went ahead and expressed it I said and I didn't know and realize the biggest portion of the people admitted it that their thoughts was 2000 years ago of Jesus Christ walking on the shores of Galilee would be the first time they would be thinking of son of God and I said even the Bible says that when who was it the three Hebrew children throw the fiery furnace and in the Nebuchadnezzar come forth and said I see four and said one of them's like unto the Son of God but I said then I said didn't I we would would we worry about son of man until we understand the form our way of dealing with son of God and that's it all of your riders your theologians and things will go back into Genesis and you write you reach Cofield and it's footnotes which is great and that that first form that came out of God was called a son of God now then see we think we get it all figured out now I'll ask the question this way when we reference with the name Jesus we will show these things as we go along when the reference comes with an named Jesus what do you think of the Bible II shape of a form of a man that walked on the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago and we called him Jesus why do we need to know this you sound like you make things so complicated I try to make it simple you're the ones making it complicated by not just plainly listening and getting away from all of your thoughts and just listening don't you see what I'm talking about this morning the Bible makes a report Isaiah made a report 52 chapters he spoke of the Messiah spoke of all the time folk of the world spoke of the coming vocal John the Baptist spoke of all those things and then is it said who had believed I report report that he'd made heard all the prophets up to that time because that's what the prophets were doing making a report from God to mankind about God and trying to tell us about him and they did then Isaiah says now I'm going to make a report and the report he made broke Jesus Christ right to Calvary to the beating to where you didn't want to look at him in all things and describing it right down to that point and he made a report you know what had happened that way the report was right right see can we make a report after all of the years that we studied the message why is there so much confusion but it's the same thing as it was and when I was adamant in the denominations and the Baptist to ask questions of people and wandering out of one Bible how they could be and I didn't know the number amount of how many there was but there was 969 at least denomination probably about the time I was saying that according to what the Prophet said out of 969 you had at least 500 different interpretations or thoughts some of them were overlaid each other you know about God out of one Bible you got one prophets message you're not supposed to put out a book for the two souls believers this message it only has two soul doctrines written in it so let the others put out a MOOC and on to Lourdes or any kind of ideal I thought it was one message I thought they and I appreciate them at voice of God recordings to try to be so specific about trying to make sure everything is worded the way the Prophet said it without a one message we wind up with all of these thoughts and ideas what about it what about simply the name of God like I said you said what it's name is God I guess we just go home know that that's as far as your mind goes my mind will forget it you come to Genesis 1 and I think it's 33 times if you use the name God God created heaven the earth God created is my created act got great animals it's about 33 times 32 33 times you use the name God well what about it - let's ask the Prophet a question as the name of the Lord changed in different dispensations we asked him I like to ask see I like that's the Prophet let him answer it don't you woof the questions and answers realtor in 1964 paragraph 137 138 it has the name of the Lord changed in the different dispensation yes yes it was once called he was called the I am he's called Jehovah and he's changed many times the last time it was changed was when God became flesh and took a human name Jehovah I am and all of those are titles to a name if you would baptize in the name of Jehovah it had to be the name of Jesus Christ if you would baptize in the name of Jehovah right by Jove with the Nasus genre all those is how to be Jesus Christ the I am is Jesus Christ that is Jesus say that when he talking to him he said before Abraham was I am right now what I'm wanting to get to is just to go through the Old Testament if we get to it this evening to try to bring up the titles in their relationship and what I want you to remember is one thing we'll it started out as an illustration of brother Branham of Elohim then we'll go to Jehovah moving on what I want you to remember is one thing God may change in the meaning of titles who reference to his name but God don't change I think that's according to Malachi 3 in it where he said I'm God and I changed not all right so then you're not going to say take this name and try to take this name and see that he changed no you're going to see that you take this name and then when it changes in this name comes into view it's a further look or advancement or the revelation of the one true and living God now you're following me because you got to combine them and you see where we're going to be slow when we get into the Godhead you've got to combine all of the titles before you can say Jesus you can't leave out any titles and come to the name Jesus why are you reading here to save us that's what somebody told you in - so keep that little thought in your mind to see God the titles down truth the Old Testament form as he changes the way he deals with man that is God not changing but the way he's dealing is changing but that you cannot to say well we don't need this anymore now I quote it let's see unveiling God the run said let me read you John 1:1 he said in the beginning without him Elohim was without him and Elohim was tell him and said el ahem we've made flesh and dwelt among us and has a problem did you have any trouble using Java but just remember now don't ever do away with anything a further advancement of Revelation is based entirely upon your foundation of where you started he's like Martin Luther as much as I say on that you ought to know it Martin Luther started to just you live by faith but we're above that now we don't need that no more we're going on out you're you going on out all right John Wesley stood on the new birth of what he thought for his day and started a message called sanctification he never rejected Luther's message he brought the message of sanctification the Pentecostals stood on Luther's message in Wesley's message and the Holy Ghost came had they not stood on it it would not have followed it that's how Stern I'll make it read understand he's not doing away if looking at the way God is revealing himself for you and I to understand now who in a peanut brain of mankind can comprehend an eternal God I mean a God that created everything Oh God that at one time according to his titles was self-existing which means nothing existed with him not a NAT not a bat not a bird or anything and not a human being existing with him or his title would be wrong you see that's the way I love the answer because the people of this message are great to put forth a lot on predestination I was back dire where I got to probably I'm back down the very first title of self-existing does away with any existence of mankind as mortals at parks or whatever we are because that he was self existing then nobody existed with him I like your way Brett a random citizen cuz he makes the marvelous statements you know that you just you really you just have to take it for what it says one day he was talking about God and talking about eternal and he said in the beginning before the eternal now they no human mind can comprehend that statement the interning to go just as far that away is it goes that away it has no beginning and no ending and yet God existed before eternity that's the point in it but yeah we think we got it over lady's name God so just remember the Prophet said has the name of the Lord changed in different dispensation he said yes yes it was once called he was called the I am he's called Jehovah and he's changed many times the life time it was changed was when God became flesh and took a human name all of those others Jehovah Elohim you know all of those are just titles to a name it's like father son Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost is not a knight right he's got a name his father that's a title to a name that's an expression or something it is not a name he said well that sure was I'm a father well I don't like to be nasty but I like to be straight you know the Bible says to call no man father what it says don't call no man father now you know the Bible's not saying don't call your daddy father he's calling telling you don't call no man father big group of people got a whole lot of father you know you know what I mean okay you're good little Catholic you say father all the time don't you father didn't bother them that's the kind that the Bible is saying don't call no man father don't make nobody above God are you winning it all right but God has many titles to his name and as we come down through using those titles I hope you follow a pattern that is not using a name and then annihilating all the other with the next time it'll be used as another title but it'll have another reference added onto that title which is the same one Scofield leaving in his footnote you know you say well I don't like Scofield well that's alright we'll just read brother Branham so the you know you like him let's go filling these footnotes is covering Ella him Jehovah and he said from that we defies the name H of H AV EA 8 and he says by that then we develop his name to be Jehovah like I told your witness one time I said I'm a better Jehovah Witness and you are he said you are IC al I said because the me that you over the old Jesus of the new boy here this and this young guy was with him he said I never heard that you know he's willing to talk the old guy said let's go let's go he's getting him away but I said have you never read the Bible and we just read it to you jover witnesses I'm not against them that's their business right which I'm about right here let your whole the witness that's the Jehovah they use that and we just read to you in proverbs 18:10 that he was known by the name of Almighty God but said by my name Jehovah I was never known unto them that's what I asked him and I said why do you call him Jehovah when he said he was never known by that he was known by jvh you all right now you're gonna go with a couple of things so just flop all you want to brother amuses jvh musings a VHD he said well this is resetar it's one of them too but there's no way to pronounce that there's not a pronunciation I'm not an English major but you'd have to add some things to be able to pronounce that I don't know where you call them BIOS or whatever you call them or consonants is evolved jvh you you got to add something to it to be able to pronounce it so they added letters to it and pronounced it as Jehovah now like I was saying we said well what God's name is God will how come he says jehovah is his name over here we're reading a minute where he said Joel was at night but then we're reading what we read to start with that by my name jehovah's i never no no see they never understood I'm trying to get us to look at one thing for certainty it will get away from our old ideas and thoughts the Bible opens up to become a beautiful book that you can just study it and roll and just think about the things that's being said and how wonderful because we remembers we will get to in the godhead series that we're starting pretty quick that remember it is the condescending of God to reveal himself and one of the meanings where you add Elohim Jehovah in hava comes out to be Jehovah which it means the one who existed alone is now revealing himself that's one of the thoughts the one who existed alone is now revealing himself who took communion right all right now let's start and see what we got so we go to Genesis 1 as I said we read in Genesis 1 32 or 33 times that it uses the name g.o.d if you look at that in your Scofield Bible verifies the way that I talk now not ever translation doesn't do it but a lot of them the biggest portion do when you have a small case letter word it has a different form of meaning or thought than when you do when you capitalize that word if it no it's just the start of a sentence well then you explain to me why they didn't John 5:24 I believe it is says God is a spirit and that uses a small case or middle case which one you want to use smaller case g.od you say well let's just start the sentence well why didn't it start the sentence for the capital form he said what about us okay Hebrews let one woman says God created and that's upper case the bigger case gone you know what I mean lowercase s G Oh reverse D uppercase is G big Oh Big D big you know birth all these things with wrote around them to where you'll see it when it talks of him being his god and then when he created man he said Lord God it has the meaning of understanding to try to express what's being saying you don't have to have all of this jumbled up as you think I do but just get what I'm talking about Pro Dyer in Genesis one throughout the entire chapter even to the making of man in 1:26 and 27 it still uses the lowercase of God because if you listen to this you'll see and I love it so much you read your Bible with this thought in mind read it and watch when it'll say Lord God when that lowercase G or whatever or lowercase L when it's dire Remini it means God is here talking to us but when it's up in the upper case it means the God of heaven and if you'll take what I read about Cyrus the King to the building of the temple if you read that in Ezra 1 you will see and it uses the italicized letter of Lord that King recognized that God of heaven told him to build a house it's wonderful if we get it in the right way and it will come out the right understanding but get the point it's telling him all right so we start off we're trying to understand God and we can only use the terminologies that mankind is used to express it and it's the word Elohim now go ahead to number 2 but with unused number woman go ahead number two which is a mighty garden bio before us in the beginning he wasn't even God now our English word God God means an object of worship how confusing it is to the mind you can make somebody of God you can make anything of God but in the Old Testament in Genesis 1 in the beginning God it is used Elohim Elohim means the self the existing one what a difference between the word Elohim is 2 our word God Elohim means the self existing one all right self existing means he existed alone nobody wouldn't with him he created angels but then there was with him nothing was dark and he himself with you this you're just making him with you know we just well you won't explain I'm not sarcastic rightful I'll let you explain it women are whatnot but all you can do is use words and terminology to speak to human mankind so the first thoughts is self existing the one who existed alone nothing with him not no second person or third person to share things with because he ain't no second person or third person it's revealing one crew and living God it could not be pronounced back dire as to say in the beginning Jesus created the heavens and the earth they didn't how the language in the end to come into name Jesus yet that four thousand years later but that would not have been confusing to mankind remember the Bible is written that the wise and prudent cannot understand it but the simple can that can be revealed to them i right now nothing against education I'm using it right now to prove the point so the word is Elohim the self existing one he groped totally alone nobody with him nothing there but God himself you can't go no further than that what could you use any other name to reference something back Pais self-existing you can't you can't do it so you use it and the theologians used it and it came up with it because it would read it out of their scrolls and done and they knew that that meant a specific time so they said okay this is LAN this is self-existing you know until God created man putting a few things ahead were to be interesting to you until God created man in Genesis 1:26 and 27 he was self existing the animals even though they came into creation there are not part of God their creation even the Angels created beings but not a part of God so until you get to Genesis 1:26 and 27 don't even consider him to be anything other than self existing because there's nothing existing with him that is like him now remember remember Genesis 1:26 and 27 he's still dealing adela himself existing because they ain't no human elements Dyer we will get to that later there's no human elements Genesis 2:7 he creates man or two six I'm ready he creates a physical man - until man time came into being now listen to what I'm getting at until Jesus Christ came on earth and human flesh would be the first time that the name of God could really develop in human now come on get the right story the name of Jesus was never pronounced right get the right story well the name of Jesus is never pronounce you mean they never nobody ever said Jesus now I'll quote brother Branham with you okay but around said there were plenty of Jesus's in the days of Jesus there were plenty of people called Jesus there are plenty of people today called Jesus hey is it hazers in Spanish it doesn't mean when he say the first time it's spoken by human lips the name of Jesus a baby received life in the womb that name had been used many many many many many times before then all the way down through but it never referred to the right person nothing so it didn't make no difference that's why brother Branham would say you can call him Jesus Jesus and won't get nothing yet he said ask anything in my name but then as long as you're dealing with up to Genesis 1 through there you're dealing with self-existing he has created animals has created the world has created light moon stars create off and he still self-existing he creates man in 1:26 27 he still self existing then he creates man in Genesis to get your Bibles and look if you got any form of a Scofield or any type of Bible that is to amount very much it'll say in Genesis 2 let's just read it I didn't put a lot of these up they can pull them if they want to it's used as Genesis 1:26 all of it I'm in Genesis 1 to 28 it is used as God and read your Bible and you read in Genesis 2 they start talking it said God with the same small form our note blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made these are the generations of heaven the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God what do you want to capitalize it whatever you want to do all that is just a reference to understand you got it right there in front of you the word God is used if you roll it down to verse 2 or 3 God and God blessed the seventh day that's still self-existing now roll up now which what do we got immediately in Genesis 2 as man starts to come into being is physical it goes to Lord God and then when you get on over to verse 7 believe us right yeah verse 7 it says the Lord God formed man didn't say God formed man said the Lord God that's what I said it didn't matter about you want to listen to me about capitalization of these things or that uh read your Bible he said Lord God so that means something happened the self existing one it existed in Chapter one creating world and all the things in man inner spiritual condition he's still alone himself existing when you come to Genesis 2 he's Lord God which means Jehovah Elohim remember the statement and we'll get back to it later then when you start using jehovah you're going to come to a primary meaning that will say the self existing one that existed alone begins to reveal himself then think about it the self existing one that existed alone and you know that when he created man in a physical state he will never be self existing again he's a self existing one yeah but he'll never Cottle a self existing because once he created man he had something in his own image that simple something in his own image man animals not in this image so then he goes to Jehovah and watch it the minute Jehovah will come to a finality of meaning a father with his family when he created physical man on the earth and brought him into being he will never be accepted system anymore he'll be the self existing one that now exists with his family but his name was Java so then we're coming down go ahead to number four let's get that go to this attributes have to lay these out for you to understand and be able to follow me and then to when we get around at a while if we don't today I'll try to correct it by Windsor there's one sheet in y'all's notes it's mr. okay old age go to message adoption he said Genesis the first chapter 126 when God called his name Lord God it's in the word él ella ella hem which means herself existing one I watch him there was nothing else existed with him there was no hair there was no light there was no starter in the world there was no nothing else it was God and God alone lol ahem now that made now what's inside of that was attributes inside of him we'll get back to these which meant that he was inside of this great lll ahem was an attribute you know what an attribute is are let's say like this was a nature so that's the little fella will show that they'll get it and I wanted little fellers has to get it that way inside of him was the nature to be a father but he was self existent there ain't nothing for him to be a father by and now down inside of that was something else that was called God and God is an object of worship but he was self existent LLO him Ella him regard was nothing to worship him inside of him was to be a savior he dull him self exists him there's a time he self-existing he has his college now say it this way he saw a man in the garden and according read around him and he saw a man in the garden without even he said man was lonely in God in the beginning was lonely that he wanted something to exist with he was self-existing so he wanted something to exist with so what did he do then he was still self existing for a long time nothing existed before him go down to number seven thank the city do we use out Big Wednesday when God made they called him LLL ahem L owe him nothing existed before him and he was all the existence that there ever was self-existence one Ellen Ellen Parker but in Genesis two when he made man he said I am why aah-ooh juv you H yeah Hugh Jehovah then what you what did it mean I am the all existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine the Genesis true them Old Glory Lang game Angela means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't Seth existent anymore he exists with his family amen LLL ahem now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family Schofield said the same thing there's probably or other I'm got it from I'm giving you that the scholars knew that the darks brother branham saying it when it comes to Jehovah he comes out to be the one who exists with his family because he created man in Genesis 2 he come down in the garden to fellowship with man right and he was Jehovah no longer self-existing so now your title in him tell him Jehovah the self-existent God that one time existed alone now has brought his family of mankind into being and he will no longer be listed only as Elohim he will be listed in going through your Bible you see one comma where it continually says Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord God Lord God Lord God so he doesn't go back to being self existing so then when you see it your whole life you see one who exists with his family thank you but think about it for the number-8 who you exceeded he'll stay Jehovah throughout the Old Testament those he's with his family well let's see we got number eight going down to number that's what I'm saying we mess it up some more book will go and Moses said unto God which is Exodus 13 15 and Moses said unto God this is coming on over to Moses right you remember where he's at saying to them the god of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall say to me this is Moses at the burning bush right and they will say unto me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am what didn't hate what is it's not users it's over why is it not used as Ellingham why is it not used as you oh well ahem what is the name of God I am that I am you know I did Jesus come along before Abraham was I am God sending emotion I am that I am he said I shall say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you you're going down reading and you'll get into it maybe here in this part yeah here it is the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me unto you in other words Moses goes down and he says the God of Abraham we got of Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me they said we know who Abraham was we know who Isaac was we know who Jacob was but who are you but what name is this one that you talk to in the bush and remember it wouldn't written out in the bush I am that I am there was a name appeared or a thought or a concept or a title and he said I am it means I am that I am lets you God centered more moreover unto Moses dot the shield I say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations what a night but when the scholars wrote it out or what the ones that wrote it all that could ride is what it meant this is my name forever you know its name today if I am that I am you sure that's not a name Jesus that I am that I am he didn't use I am that I am he said before Abraham was I am you'll find in the book of Acts it says Jesus spoke to Moses from the burning bush are you with me so I can call out that Scripture I got them oh I am done releasing a lot of it but in the book of Acts it said book Jesus spoke to Moses I'm a commotion in the burning bush he was the angel of the Lord remember what Moses and when it says about this burning bush it says the angel of the Lord spoken to Moses who was that I angel of the Lord it was the Lord Jesus Christ before the name Jesus came into being we call him that I am that I am that name for heaven's sakes don't try to do away with that we don't believe in your way we don't believe in Joel will it do what you want that we just don't leave this just don't lose that I am because you know what it means it means a prophet gives the interpretation it means ever-present for eternity that's what I am that I am mean ever-present for eternity he'll never lose that part he never loses Jehovah because he right now is Jehovah with his family he never lost L owe him my brother branham as I said you can say this is the way you read John 1:1 in the beginning with L ahem hello him was with him and Ella him was Ella him oh no it says in the beginning was guard to guard with garden he's showing the self-existing one he's showing the one who wanted this stood alone is now in human flesh go ahead what number nine will read that where you won't forget it he's talking about the I am that I am and I am was not yesterday Nakamura it's ever-present the same I am in every age in every generation or eternity is still I am now you are still that great I am NOT I was or will be yet you was and you will be but your ever present I am what about a name so great to be ever present he was called Jehovah now get the point and I wind it up mister minute he was called your home in the Old Testament not but get the point to where just run through this go to number 11 Psalms 83 18 it men they know that thou whose name alone is Jehovah are the most high over all of the earth they could call him Jehovah that was the title use because remember what we said want to go in the proffer what it's a Java means a father with especially by dying name that I exist with my family with the children of Israel is Java going to the next one as they are 12 behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also has become my salvation you got a selling compound names of jehovah right got the Old Testament George George over tsking you a woman a sherbet the seven come down names of Jehovah in the Bible the Old Testament and if he's George our which is our salvation then who's Jesus Christ I thought he was our salvation okay look at Isaiah 26 and for trusting in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength and where you can't become but then why would he say but I'll have to end it with this talk but why would he say it we read Exodus 6 God spoken to Moses and said unto him I am the Lord now if you're done to Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them why we're reading here what was back tire we're reading with educational understanding of words and dollars in a profits definition and we can talk about elohim Jehovah Yahweh's and all that he said by not my name is Jehovah you mind putting it this way by my name JV hu I was never known cause no vowels to pronounce it so they added the vowels and they pronounce it you over that was not the name what about it let's read a couple in it I'll quit I got to read these then we get it read number 15 which is God keeps his word job that God was still living and God had sent him and said go tell them that I am that sent you and I was or I will be I am a present tense he is not I was claimed God that the depths of miracles the pious in the fight because you don't believe it right if he's I am he just as real as he was at the burning bush that great name that he appeared dark and no scholar yet has ever been able to interpret and he appeared at the burning bush he appeared as jvh you they can't pronounce it he said where they could be revealed you got to have something to connect it to where it's no good on your revelation they call it Jehovah but it wasn't no one can interpret it why the eternal one amen he dwells in the light he dwells in eternity he called immortality is everlasting I am lelou you he says going to make sure you'll see what I'm talking about go to 16 which is questions and answers on Hebrews alright now watch this first face there jesus said I am where Abraham was I am I am who was the I am there has never been a man in the world could interpret it even that you who read the lexer country so for there has never been a man who could make it out its jv8 you and even the Hebrew scholars could never pronounce it that burning bush died that day when he met with Moses it was jv8 you so they pronounced it Jehovah but it isn't Jehovah jvh you no one knows that's why I said by my name jv8 you by my name Jehovah even though they called him Jehovah all the way down right he said you don't really understand the meaning of my name you're calling me Jehovah and that's acceptable for the time because it means a father with his family I said that's not my name he said I am sitting I like this one with 17 God's chosen place of worship 1965 now what is his 9 first and once his point will have to name fine what God's name is before we can find out what it is he's putting in the place we got to find out his name before we can know a place that he to worship that's the whole message if you'll read the message if I can get the title of the message God's chosen place of worship got to find out where to put the night and he does what none of them were names to over j phi r fi java lily-of-the-valley the morning star all that but he has a name whenever at Moses look he had not a name yet and he told Moses I am that I am and when we see Jesus on earth speaking in in Hebrews the sixth chapter British st. John 6th chapter he said I am that I am no that's not yes I am it's not that I am written there in John why would a man over not over 50 years old and say that you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am and I am was the one the burning bush the pillar fire that was in the burning bush back in the days of Moses and I am the I am Jesus was declaring to be an access it as he was in the burning bush and spoke to Moses go read your Bible and John he was declaring that he was in that bush speaking to Moses he said I am I am give me a minute okay you get tied up into something I got about seven or eight pages left you're seeing what I had to throw away from this morning go to number 18 testimony of the razor the dead baby dead boy this is back in 53 and God told Moses he said now I'm going to send you mine angel before you to keep you in the way now anyone knows that that angel was Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh Jesus the flesh was not in the burning bush I asked you a while ago when I say Jesus does your meaning go straight to the flesh Jesus never existed before the world now listen as a human flesh but he existed as Jesus Christ because Christ is the Angel of the Covenant anyone knows that I enjoy Jesus crush which was a fill of fire his name wasn't Jesus yet until he was manifested in flesh he didn't eat that you one more likely adoption which would be number 19 Father Son and Holy Ghost is not no name of God God has one name in his name is Jesus the Bible said the family to heaven his name Jesus family and earth is named Jesus that's right God so God had one name human night he had a name called Jehovah Jireh Joe Bereta no titles but he had one 19 Jesus are you going into the one that's Jesus only I wish they would accept the truth I'd love to talk to him because of what I just said if you were listening Ellingham was God made manifest in one form which meant the self existing one moves over starts revealing himself to mankind in Genesis two he becomes Lord God Jehovah Elohim God who exists with his family down to the Old Testament here appears to man as the great Almighty God Jehovah they could call him out on him it's according to what they were referencing to but he said when he met Moses at the burning bush he said this is my name forever why don't we call him I am the I am we do when we call him Jesus and we know who is did you catch that when we know who he is is when we get what we ask him far but if not we're just saying Jesus Jesus Jesus until we know who he is and what he's dealing with us we better keep Jesus I started off and I'll complete it by this everybody wants to know the new name the Prophet said on quote entry no Mandark conjure which means you try to figure it out he said it will be so great until they can't be questioned but you're not reading your Bible I'll make one statement to show you the reference the new name is mentioned in Revelations and I'll give him a new night that is to the six church age not the message to the seventh Ricci Bob filter Jays in the name is that the one who named living but he's dead man's loss is named sixer cage I'll write upon him my new ninety could we have already understood a lot more than we think about and unite but that's not important he said not important no because what good is it if we wanted to call him Charlie if we don't know why he's called Charlie there's no need to call him charlie right well I got his new name I like what happened when Tom a certain brother divorced his wife and married again and got him a young nice wife I reckon and younger and and she told him his new night she told him his new night old brother the Bible says that only he who would know himself it didn't say brother Colley I can tell you your new name you know you are the only one that could tell your new name and run around and said it could well be the name that was written in the Lamb's Book of Life okay but we're always worried about something this or that or the other to get a change that's why we've been here 50 years kind in carpet it there's people going this name Jesus I'm not through yet as you see we got to come out to just not be a Jesus only it's got to be Lord Jesus Christ that's why we don't baptized in Jesus only that's the name of God we no difference in using Father Son and Holy Ghost I hope you caught that background man to go he said we don't baptize in Java Jarrah shall wear a fine one there'd be no difference in using jehovah jireh jove arepa and to say Father Son and Holy Ghost once you see the truth he said my name is Jehovah which I never do they all make this statement and it will go cool musician then jvh you would be Jes UNH don't worry about the new name now you can come on over with other things later talk--i let's get that right we got to know his name jv8 you his name is j esus the only name i'm quoting brother branham the only name God ever had was Jesus it just couldn't be pronounced it couldn't be spoken by mankind as to the relation to what it really is until Jesus came in human flesh he was told by gave her she was told by Gabriel name in Jesus well was it not about names and it's not the other will fell along in about that time I miss his name with John's daddy what was his name the name of John you know John's daddy John's daddy was told what to name him was exactly like a rock he was told what to name this baby and by not believing it doing it you know what he was totally speechless for the nine months it his wife was pregnant and until he said John he didn't speak that was his first words when they signaled to him he probably wrote it down and then turned around and said John you said name down and do it let's add let it do that Jesus is nothing but I just can't understand how the name of the father of Jesus will he said I come in my father's name was the name of father's Jesus he said the Holy Ghost outstanding my father tonight so the Holy Ghost name is Jesus we know for certain the Sun on the earth was called Jesus do you understand she was very simple that you couldn't pronounce it until it was made manifest on earth his name is Jesus understand oh my god scene number 251
