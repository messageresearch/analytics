eyes my heart the eyes of my heart yes what i want to see is is the backside of it you know drops on it maybe somebody's found them around here for the life and it must be janitor take them back therefore you can't see what they are they can't see what they are oh you need glasses to find out if you're you're glasses oh okay all right okay amen that'd be pretty good any glasses to see like

fellowship meeting will be the third saturday in november you'll be valid brother uh tony i haven't have not gone out tonight you you bold i can't never get his name correct amen you just think people don't pay attention to what you're saying got a little email i talked to her sister on the phone the other day she was talking to wade to make sure she got it she's she's been listening in from india and uh telling how that she's enjoyed the message and it's really helping her and she's been through a good many of the series what she sounds and this is what she says said you may be an old hateful arrogant intelligent dude she said i love you in the lord and you're a very precious gift we had a long conversation on the phone the other night she talked with you'd be surprised how many people are actually viewing the services around the world and that's the purpose of what we're trying to do so we thank the lord for it if you'd like to learn new scriptures turn where we've been reading revelations 1 and we'll be reading from revelation 6. i don't think there's any other announcements parents have done taking care of all of it father we thank you lord for your loving your grace unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for peace and joy thank you for all thanks and you said you give them to us freely so we don't even have to do anything to get it it's just a gift that you pass down unto us lord we love you and we thank you and we pray that you bless each one be with those that are not with us today and just touch each one remember the sick among us you said it lord you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from our destruction so we just commit everything into your hands and we try to speak about you you come on the scene and speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen revelations one we've been on this for quite a while of revelation one that we just used in secondary scripture it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what time to understand amen and we go to revelation six we'll pick up verse five and six and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and be held and and i be held in love a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to study these things and you know to try to see our day and our time that we're dwelling upon the earth that's right and the main thing and i'll repeat this in a minute because i want you to get it we're not talking about these things to just look back and see what was i i'm wanting you and i to see what's taking place now an hour day in our time because to preach about what it was back there is a it's just a story you know right just a thought or an idea and you know it can be true and i'm sure it is but we want to get it down to the day that we're living the prophet preached a message one time recognizing your day in its message well it's not only just recognizing the day and the hour that that the prophet was to come upon the earth and bring a message but to recognize your day that's what i'm trying to get you to see the book of revelations is written to you because the things that are happening in from revelation 6 1 on through right you know it's not concerned with the bride it's it's to israel but we look at that and we see what will happen there and then we see what's happening now because what happens there has its beginning here that's right are you listening that's the main thing i want you to see whatever would happen it'll have its beginning somewhere that's like in genesis everything begins in genesis all right and then it comes down to this day any doctrine any idea any thought you can go back to genesis with it all right then you can take the seals and and one of them will tie the entire bible together the prophet said all right then we can go back through the bible and see the day that we're living right it's fine to look back and see what somebody else done like what he was saying one time you know he's preaching about abraham he said well wait a minute i'm not i'm not just talking about abraham i mean it's our journey it's our doing decision right here now there's no need of just just stories to tell about somebody else but when you experience it yourself you live through it then you can see you know your day and it's time and who you are it's not going to put us in the rapture to know the bible now listen to what i'm saying even to know the letter of the bible that we could read it that we could memorize it to be able to quote every verse in the bible that's not going to put us in the rapture right it's when the word is revealed luther preached no telling how many sermons on maybe a topic called the just shall live by faith because he preached the bible and surely he preached a lot of things but see one day it was quickened that's right and when it was quickened he was not afraid see maybe what he was seeing it caused a lot of uprisings had come back in that time and people were trying to protest the catholic church and things and their control and you know they'd be afraid not like the apostles were when they were gathered in the upper room they had the letter of the word right amen they'd walk with the lord jesus but they were scared to death right but when the holy ghost came he took away their fear it made something personal see when martin luther when it was revealed to him then he came off the pages into his heart and his soul of being was a just shall live by faith then he was not afraid of the world he said let them know that i'm against them you have no problems with being scared about being excommunicated because you know what that means to a catholic you know saying the other day you know we think about see bring that down to where we're at right now that we think about you know that uh when we've got to stay in the catholic church because mama is still in purgatory and we ain't got her out yet so we got to play her out you know and then then honey maybe we'll think about leaving once we get mama and grandma and grandpa all out of purgatory we'll see we would laugh about that right but have you ever talked to people that said well if the badness was good enough for mama it's good enough for me i'll stay here because mama was a good baptist well that's good mama was a good bad this probably might have been a good christian but what has that got to do with me and you yeah you know what right what has it got to do with you and i about anybody else right christianity is not based upon you and somebody else is based upon jesus christ in him alone what everybody else is is great i love my mother she raised all of us you know could have adopted us all out and got rid of us nine of us and she could have thrown us all away but she chose to raise us after daddy died well i love her and appreciate it but you know i'm not going to stay i i couldn't stay where mama had went right when the word was revealed i had to move on i've told you my brother came out he said where you going i said i don't know but i can't stay here he said well you want a church we'll build you one i said that's not what it is he said i've got to find my own way i've got to walk in whatever's leading me that's i don't have anything against anybody i said about my own people or see right but yet they're so tied up in their church until they think the church is going to take them right well that's the deception i'm trying to get you to see that's the things that we're trying to go through to get us to see here why we are like we are why is it that we're odd and different well you're just a bunch of people got another cult we're called a cult and i don't mind saying it probably about 75 percent of the people of this message are a cult that's right and i'm against them so then that's just it right i'll just talk plain okay because i don't build it up to say oh we're the only one where we're with this no the truth is the only one right so we got to do something about the truth man the bible says you shall know the truth not know about truth you shall know d notice that b means singular it was john d baptist meant it was just one if it was saying john of baptist then you could have a whole lot of them right but when it said john b it right it was that's right lord the christ there's only one right so then looking at the word and seeing it and trying to follow it down to where we're at let's find our day right let's search our hearts you know you don't know you've got error until truth is made that's known i was in the baptist church for a long time deacon for about five years or more i don't really remember you know i believe they were right i knew they had a lot of problems yeah but i still believe the word i thought but one day i found out that that wasn't exactly it they had truth but i wanted to be true right then i wanted to read the word for myself i want somebody else to read it for myself and see what it says all right now in the opening of these seals that we're talking about the the preaching of what we're doing to kind of back up and review up to where we are see we saw the first seal when it broke a white horse rider it was a rider and a white horse he had a bow and no arrows a crown was given to him later all right in that antichrist system because that's who that was that was the antichrist that little john spoke up when he calls it the antichrist an antichrist system is just a little savings the doctrines little cults and i told you we went back to genesis with it that abel was okay he tried to tell cain the truth right how many years don't know because they were offering sacrifices so that means it had to be on up to adulthood never what you want to call it he came he was trying to tell abel what the truth was he thought and that's what caused him to come up with a doctrine and he went from a doctrine to a basis did he become incarnate with his doctrine and he wouldn't believe what abel was saying so he killed cain i mean killed abraham so then the white horse he was the antichrist riding out to the deception all right second seal we saw that it was a red horse same rider but a red horse and it was given unto him to make war and to do things and to kill with a sword we can see that that been all the way through the bible because that's what it was talking about that's where cane didn't kill april now watch it when we get into this this one that it winds up being a black horse if i don't get back to it just watch kane see a curse was put on cane not to make him black it wouldn't the curse that would have been done away at the flood but it was a curse it was put on him the mark of the beast right right was put on him but darkness was put upon the heart of cain that's right god even told kenny in person said if you would have done what your brother done you would have been accepted is that what the bible said but instead of darkness came upon him blackness that he was never converted right you would never have anything to do with it and become a battle ever since you know see he said but brother dale you're talking about good people kane was a good man sure you know he wasn't a murderer mabel was a murderer right yeah come on abel killed an animal to take his place kane was a good guy out working himself to death but that wasn't what god said that's right he said it was blood right we see the world is full of good people good religious people just like it was there when jesus came on the earth was there anything that jesus could say about those pharisees about what how they were keeping the law no but he was just trying to tell them that they couldn't see pastor into their nose you remember the only trouble that god had with job you remember the thing that job's problem right job said i've offered what god said for me to offer but he thought the offering of the animal made him right when it was not the offering of the animal that was just the commandment to give right it was a believing believing in god the problem with job was he he didn't put everything into god he put it in i've done it that's right and he had you remember and the three guys kept talking to him but finally hell are you you know got that's right answered which was god to him he said you wanted to talk to me and i'm down here now to talk to you he said all all that i see wrong with you said you're just a little self-righteous he's self-righteous and he thought that what he'd done was right he was now the pharisees were self-righteous right right but jesus said unless you exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you won't they were righteous they were perfect you couldn't put a finger on them because you couldn't they would have killed them but yet they rejected god when he stood there could we do the same today see by accepting you just trying to live the word to the letter man we can be a pharisee an actor that's right you see i want to be a christian don't you yeah that's the whole of the bible what are the seals the plagues the viles or things we talk about it's a revelation of jesus christ but where's he at now he's in you and i am right all right we're not talking about a historical god of 2000 years ago that walked the shores of galilee we're talking about the god that we claim to have within us in the new earth and to walk therein see so it went from what an antichrist this is a little saiyan it went down from that to a false prophet paul dealt with them while he was here paul didn't call it antichrist because he'd never been to pat with some back john i had but paul would call it grievous woods false prophets right because by the time of paul that's what it's become men teaching perverse things like philosophers and armenians they're how you pronounce them teaching that the resurrection was passed well see paul was teaching the resurrection with spice but his was a spiritual resurrection and a new birth into the heart of man they were teaching the physical resurrection it already transpired right well paul could have simply said well show them to me yeah but instead of arguing with him he just committed him to the devil let him take care of it you see the simplicity of the opening of the word amen see this antichrist this was this first seal he had a bow with no errors very innocent very uh almost seemingly powerless and you know that a doctrine or an idea is powerless until other people join together with you sure that's right but by the time they came into the second seal see a crown was given him in the first what a triple ruling crown they made a poke when they made a pope out of the mansion they elected the head bishop you know they had all of them and they wanted to head kind of like israel right israel had a prophet but why did they want a king you see it's always through the bible why do they want a king we want to be like everybody else so they said we wanted a leader over all of us so they elected a pope because i told you he didn't start out a bad guy right it took many years before a lot of their doctrines came into view and they started killing right it came all the way on over in time before the killing started another second season all right now we read here in the third that is coming down to a a dark time now what i want you to think about today you don't get nothing out of the message get one thing we were to illustrate it oh i went with josh and him you know i may be a dodeo granddaddy but a dude but i went with josh one time on a tour of mcminnville where all the caves are at well you know if you turned out all these lots in here you'd say it's dark but it's really not have you ever been somewhere where it was just you seemed like it was the old saying you couldn't even see your finger before your nose so they were down there and they got us all together in one place and he said all right everybody turn off the flashlights and they turned off and that guy had a big old lantern thing and he turned that thing off and you talking about black yeah now if you said go north i'd ask you which way it was south or up or down or whatever it was black right right no hopes where we were at there was no hopes of finding our way out they claim that's what a lot of the cage dwellers done you know the guys that go back in on things back in the old days they had pine knots and stuff and they'd drop them or lose it and they just go haywire and kill yourself or fall off a hole because it's dark now that's what we want to think about today what would be the blackest of blackness you could think of i'm asking you for your definition wrote around and preached a little message one time you remember it was his first one he thought he done a good job i think he did but anyhow you remember he preached it started preaching about hell when he preached it there was no no mama there was no daddy there there was no god there he thought he'd done a good job i say i think he did because he got a point to me what is the what is darkness okay most of you are whispering it out so whatever it is what it's an absence of light now no matter how dark it was down in that hole if we had even just one little of those um lights that you pointers you know one of these little bitty bikes here yeah right it would have been like a greater luminous light to your eyes underground but what about when you can't even find that right right you probably said the reason it was sad for hell he said because god wasn't there you talk about something is when cain himself turned the bible said and walked away amen from the presence of the lord how dark is darkness how great is darkness what about someone who becomes so um one with a doctrinal issue right until you won't hear truth amen that's right it's all but if it's presented right don't you think jesus presented it right to the pharisees and sadducees don't you think so yeah i mean if you're not you're going to argue with god about the way to do that i think he's done a marvelous job presenting sweets off to him sure at times he had to say things but what could he have said at the other things darkness and blackness of cain to go away from the presence of god sure still have 20 20 vision let's seal yourself away because that's what i want you to watch today a darkness because that's what this third seal is it's a dark horse i remember what we were covering how we've been through it it's the same rider on each horse right because that rider starts out as an antichrist spirit which we'll find out this afternoon was already dead anyway but it wasn't called that right that antichrist spirit he was satan and the children of disobedience that paul would say deceiving the world deceived it so much until when he got off of that black horse he got on the red one and the same people that had accepted that antichrist thought wound up killing people if you don't agree with that get fox's book of martyrs and just see what all of the the historians said about it right that's what gets me and see the people who come along now and they can say well well we'll oh well we i guess we're wrong maybe the way we've done things or let's all be good brothers but you know there's an old story he said if the snake bites you once it's a snake's fault that's right it bites you twice it's yours but you see you got off of that white horse got on the red one and started killing wherever they ever apologized see if they apologized for the 68 million on their own record and say they was wrong they would be saying that that 68 million were not going to heaven think about it they can't deny their own records they made their own records if they'd killed 68 million because remember the saint augustine wrote the decree but it was better to serve god by force than to not serve him at all so they killed 68 million so they're never going to apologize for killing all those people he said look but brother dale that was back yonder that was back to you under we were all different now we are i thought the same old people right right i didn't know the world had a conversion and made everybody a christian did you i thought it was still that same thing right amen but you see church what i've tried to get you to see just like i did there wednesday a lot of you have left churches and come here and you know what they said when you left you've left the word you're out from under the blood that happened with brother richard and them years ago in that situation that happened back there and they come down here i immediately call them up to the front and if you desire it i'd be glad to do it the end of the service i brought brother richard and his family up to the front and i said i know what they've done they said you left the word and you're out under the blood so we'll just put you under the blood of this church i mean i mean it now sure all right if any of you think that some of those churches back there you've been in you know like that you're in bad shape because you left them well we'll just have a comment after the service here today and you just come up and we'll just put you under the blood here i think you already are if you're saying this is your church home but i mean if you need it that's what we'll do because see i know what those little deceiving demons are they talk to you right like i've always said you you come to church you come to a sunday morning and the devil tells you you're feeling too bad you just don't need to go this morning just wait and go this evening it only happens to me every sunday morning all right so what do you do okay i do i feel bad i'm not going today so you're sitting there pity pattern in your little headed ways and saying well you know i didn't need to go because i feel bad i like the old two man sitting out on the creek bank fishing they heard the bell ringing into the church and one of them said well you know what i went to church today the other one said i couldn't go because my wife was sick but just about the time that you look at you watching ten o'clock that old demon don't say no more that you were sick he'll say see that you ain't a christian he was christian you'd win come on they don't talk to you that way did you could win you wasn't that sick so you ain't gonna win best way to deal with the devil just get up and leave i don't care what's wife or husband if you call him the devil either get up and leave him that's right go on right now move on with god oh i want to be a good little wife or a good husband when you die and go gonna help me that way too i know i'm my oh hateful dude but is it the truth see church what is a darkness brother brandon tried to talk to that girl one time about her salvation right the next time he seen her she offered him a drink or a smoke or something she said i could see my mother's soul frying in hell and life at her so that's how bad it's got brother brown now i'm not talking about back dark there was a dark age we'll get to it a little bit the middle age prophet calls it a torah a dark age you look at your church ages that was drawn out by the holy spirit and you'll see in that dark age the light was just almost gone just a little bit of light right why because of what the church had done right the thing that was supposed to be the savior the church became the crucifiers right it was it from them down to the ages there they killed a man because he believed in one god i've never understood that i'm as honest as i can be i've never understood mankind how that you could nail up you could take a man and put him in time to a post and build a fire around him and then turn around with a cross in your hand and say deny that god and the man looks at you and said i believe in jesus who do you believe in right i believe in jesus too i'm going to kill you because you believe in jesus because you won't accept murray as the mother of god right and that's something to kill right well what about a darkness i look around at this message people and i see people that they're gone into darkness because they will not in no way accept truth right come on they have a change truth is supposed to change us okay bringing it down to our day see that antichrist he had a bow with no arrows just a teaching it's a doctrine he was given a crown and become a pope and he went forth killing the people to make them serve god isn't that something in other words he wrote a decree well let's kill everybody today in a cabinet that one went over right yeah but look how how's how it looked don't you think it's better to make people serve god than to let them die and go to hell what do you mean who are you you think you you don't want people to go to heaven we've given you a way to do it you kill them you say yeah but we wouldn't back there we don't know there's plenty of books go ahead and read if you can stomach and read fox's book of martyrs all the way through right and one day you surely got i mean one doing you surely got a good stomach i ain't never been able to make it through cut babies out of mama's dunk and throw them to them pigs to eat all in the name of religion strap them down with an ox pulling one way and one pulling the other way and just rip them to pieces if you're going to kill at least do it sensibly and nice you know cut the guy's stroke that's the easiest way to kill somebody they say on this side over here there's a big vein you just whack that one and you're dead at least be humane i was reading one time about taking a a metal chair and building a fire under it taking people's clothes off women take their clothes off and strip them down and pour stuff all over this foxy book of martyr and take them and make them set down on that red-hot chair but those brothers my brother tell them they're good people well okay right what about it so let's start reading just a little bit now we've read these a lot of these i'll give them over to you over to you over to you we'll keep on giving them over to you too i don't want you to get the point what i want you to see if nothing else to see the same rider riding on the same horse and remember the horse doesn't stop right the writer gets off the white horse gets on the red one the prophet said that white horse goes all the way and strikes eternity that antichrist spirit is still here now the same one that started in genesis but still you're deceiving the horse don't stop yeah it just keeps on going the red horse he rides in it gets off the red gets on the bus the red one just rides right on the black the pale it's the same writer satan he said you're against him people and good people i'm not against nobody i'm against the devil and his control that he had upon mankind through religion amen all right we didn't come here for freedom of religion america wasn't established on freedom of religion is that was established on freedom from religion we came here to get away from religion we get the things that bound there come right all over and binding here right but now it's done through as i said we laughed at the catholics saying we're going to pray for grandma out of purgatory but then we come up to say well i go to church in the baptist methodist whatever because mama win is good enough for a mom that's good enough for me you think we still don't have that same ideas that they had catholics will tell you give me a child that's five years old and i'll always remain a catholic right that's how stunts they believe i say the new birth will change it but see they're putting it on the bases that the message is bad this presbyterian pentecostal can't change it i'm just come on but you see church the antichrist is still deceiving amen and you know where he's at in the pulpit who do you think he's got all this started and brother the preacher well how do we know whether you're right or not well what does the word say amen that's all i got to say about it ain't going to argue with you about whether i know i'm a dodeo aggravating dude but there's one thing about it you know i don't try to pull nothing over on you either i tell you like it is then you're gonna have to face god for the way it is if not you come and show me in the bible where i'm off all right amen i'll be glad to tap a sign right up here and i'm a false prophet show it to the world on the biggest internet system can be found if you can show me in the words where i'm wrong let's start out let's get something because what we've tried to keep this point before you see god is father son and holy ghost but satan you gotta have antichrist false prophet incarnate false prophets that's what's saying it pope and then the beast all right now keeping those things before us to where we'll understand it you remember joel said the cankerworm polyworm locust and the caterpillar all right that's the same thing as your your go to what is it can't get worm palm worm looks like it's four stages of one bug right right the bug goes through the cocoon he comes out of this he winds up being a butterfly he wind up being this and you know and then he just goes right back and makes it circle again because it's that's his stages it's the same old bug well that's the way it is with with satan you couldn't start out in that first church and say i'm going to take place of god no that wouldn't work but you've got to get the people to believe it that's right that's right now the catholics don't believe now listen that the pope is god you know the god of heaven right they believe that he's instead of god or in god's stead or in the place of god i'm not throwing off on them i'm just telling their doctrine right they believe that he is taking the place of god and if god has to transmit down something to earth he can use the pope to do it and he's elected you know like i said wednesday you let god all those bishops and things and ain't just one guy running right they have a whole bunch of them and then they elect who's going to be the one that god can come down and incarnate but it's the same stage but see can't warn palmer locust caterpillar restoration of rivalry but what does god do justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and then the word that's right right man so he's fighting there's four horse riders in the book of revelation one through the first through the fourth seal these are forest rider on each one amen but there's also a combat beast yes sir right on each one that says come and see right now so look at it put it back up ready now go back to number one let me get to it he said i want you to notice the forward the mathematical one first antichrist white second false prophet red third parker of heaven and earth and purgatory black that's what we're gonna get onto today and the fourth is the beast hello horse satan being kicked out now that beast can't be until satan is kicked out of heaven that's right now if you think daniel's 70 weeks ain't important brother brown says you can't understand the seals unless you understand daniel 70 weeks okay now if you'll go to that book you'll find that he explains revelations 12 in the daniel 70 week's book that's one of the things you can't understand so you see now where you'd be this nice one is going to be this evening we get to it he's going to be kicked out of heaven right amen but you know the bible says right now he can go before god come on the book of job read it said where you been he said i've been going through and throwing the earth he's talking to god the devil is right you know a lot of times i can't get an audience with god but the devil can sit up and talk to him know that would make us all upset but instead of being upset i know what he's doing he's using that old boy that's right he's using him to bring me amen he used that old boy to bring job down and get job down to where he would get out of his own self-righteousness and look up to god no satan you just keep on talking to him tell him all about how this hateful arrogant old dude just tell them all about how bad i am but you see one day he's to be cast out right well you know what's going to cause him to be cast out well that's this afternoon when the bride goes up he's cast out see when we go up he can't stay i love that he ain't going to be able to step forward when we knew that won't work would you see one comment first antichrist why exactly false prophet read third bikers of heaven earth in purgatory black fourth is the beast all right now jump to the next one try to get these fights all right do we ride on damn this is taken from the first seal of progress 322. here he is it's the antichrist he started riding in the first church age they ride them down on damn through every age watching he's riding he doesn't stop he keeps riding he's riding that horse all right see coming down it's the same rider all the time number three white horse we've seen what he's done perfectly here comes the red horse we see exactly what he's done here comes the black horse you see the same writer all the time what's he doing right on down through the ages when they get what i was saying want to go he comes up riding that by horse he gets off that horse gets on a red one that white horse just keeps right on going through the deception he gets onto the red you look around the world today over the name of religion and see how many people's being killed over the name of religion and i know i'm an american i believe in it but we go to a country like afghanistan or some of those countries iraq we go there to free the people from bondage of their religion right exactly right right all right we free those women to where they don't have to wear the veils anymore we turn them loose and let them become prostitutes on the street yeah are we really good people or what are we doing all right come on we go to africa and free the people when brother run said he was over there and said not one case of a narrow disease he said before they marry they've got to take emergency tests oh we freed them to become prostitutes i don't think you got to put a black veil over your face and drag your tracks out with a dress no but i think you ought to look right and dress diesel i've always said true blind where's language a barber she said there she is sister we used to talk about these religious people i told her one day i said sister barbara same women they just got their face covered you know you can't tell me that the face covered with the veil and the law saying if you do this or that other thing kill you that don't change thinking that's right it's just a different veil still doing it maybe you're not doing it out and open but still doing the same thing listen the different stages of satan's ministry the writer is the same it does not say white writer red writer black writer pale writer doesn't say that the man's the same he's the devil but when the horse comes in it's the symbol of what he's doing quite righteous very deceiving red killing united what probably said church and state he couldn't go out killing the first pope didn't go out kill him had to wait until constantine united church and and state they could take the pilot because like i said you go down here now kill a bunch of people while they arrest you but if you get the people behind you they want to arrest you you get the government behind you come on see the point i want you to see is some of you are catching on to what i'm trying to say because what you're doing is we've talked i have with some of you in discussion but you're not looking back there you're beginning to look here where we are now now that's a good idea it don't matter to me what has been that don't control me it's what it is that's why i say that i'm against the biggest portion of the minister to this message because they're not preaching the prophet's mission that's right they're not preaching salvation they're preaching a book of rules that's right believing a prophet you don't believe the prophets you're going to die go to hell if you don't believe jesus christ you're going to die if you believe jesus christ you're going to automatically be his problem right because you can't deny his prophet right and say that jesus christ is true if it's god's prophet right now that sensible all right see i don't have any words about it but she looked and seeing what we're doing now can you still see that writer and there's still a deception right preachers will come in i've seen them and you have to they'll be just preaching alone going real good everything goes real good and all at once right out of nowhere for no uncall for a reason richard says about aaron he gets off his one rabbit trail onto another one that's what he said about you know brother i didn't say that because i believed it because it's pretty good about us preachers we'll be going sometime and we'll just take off and go like hell that's not too bad that's off on rabbit train you can come back right but what i'm talking about is these preachers when it ain't got nothing to do with their sermon whatsoever and right in the middle of it have you seen that great revelation about jude and taymor oh my how that judah had a relationship with tamar and it brought that seed right down it didn't have anything to do with his message right now but you see he planted his seed right that's it you ever sat on a jury yes exactly right when the lawyer gets up here and he says so what's those said so and so on the judge said that's your say you can't bring that up in court strike that from the record you can't strike it out of the brain it was the people that hurt it he got his point across he planted the seed right out of what he does again or just bam erase that from the records i think that is point across right now that's what the preachers are doing they preach real good and i don't want you to see him go and then he jumps back especially they do here sometimes craw brother one time was preaching away here and he said something and i was gone i wouldn't hear but i certainly heard about it because he was preaching away on something all that once the whole church went right and he said what's wrong he's i say something wrong i'll just tell you what the prophet said well he wasn't telling what the prophecy that's why everybody shut up on him you know they set out on me i'm glad you did right he let him know a whole lot more what if i'd have told him he's wrong but you see people get their point across just a little saying right then here comes the young preachers alone right and they're just preaching judah and tamar and just all these doctrines like crazy and you say something to them about it well i just preached it called brother so much i was preaching right exactly right now you've got a doctrine right doctrine and he said well danny right well who are you you think you know everything no but i know somebody does yeah but do you think you know everything see they're killing you then right why because you kill a man's influence right come on are we still in the seals the a man's influences to kill the man you go out and kill my influence with people now i've said it straight and i mean it straight if i'm wrong and you tell people i'm wrong you're okay but if i'm right and you tell people i'm wrong you got a problem with god that's insane see but you kill my influence you kill me come on trying to bring them down the seals and things down the sense of simplicity of us thinking amen and you go out and won't hear nothing else you'll be like cain was kane said paraphrasing what he said he said god i've done all i'm going to do it's what your prophet said he said take it or leave it can't he never repented all right so he was saying before almighty god i'm not going to change he went into a blackness it would never be removed from him amen that curse follows him and his descendants all the way through all right what effect i'm asking you and me a simple question what effect does doctrines and ideas have upon us right sure what about it what effect does doctrines and ideas have upon us have you ever let an idea get in your mind and then you wouldn't even go to church maybe lay out a while or do something because some idea he said brother dylan you're talking about me bro mold had a good point the military they had a thing you military guys noted and he was crawling around on the ground out there and they had this barbed wire and stuff and you crawled around on it they had a gun that was firing live ammunition and it was right up over your head you know it's no problem as long as you didn't stand up right because it wasn't see if i say something to you and it offends you why what's the problem i'm gonna ask you is it the truth well you didn't present it right when jesus said you are of your father the devil he wasn't presenting that too much right to them either was it the truth is true what kind of effect does doctrines and ideas have to do on the things you and i what you hear like i've always told you i say nothing to you about you ask me can i listen to brother so-and-so's tell you yes you're welcome to listen to anybody you want to when you bring that thing back in this church that's right and i hear somebody start talking about it right i'm going to approach it from the pulpit right right and i'm going to tell you that that doctrine has no place here and if you don't like it you leave with it right because i'm going to be playing i'll try to be honest with you to say listen to people but let the holy spirit what's wrong that's right all right this is online i don't get it off i guess what's the matter why can't the holy spirit keep us straight right you got the holy ghost and it can't keep you straight you mean the holy spirit can't keep this thing no straighter than what it all is you mean there's 969 different denominations in the world that's a long time ago yeah there's about 2 000 in this message and the holy spirit can't keep it straight right there's something wrong somewhere my language go hateful dude somebody ain't got the holy ghost right all right you got the holy ghost you can't turn the word down now when it's first presented you might not like it when it's first said you might not agree wholeheartedly but if that holy ghost is inside of you you will somewhere line back up with that word neither you or anybody because you can't argue with the holy ghost is inside of you you ever heard somebody preaching and you didn't know what it was you stopped making something wrong amen you did something wrong yeah okay we trust him right hey man why look at me the other day i just broke up she said what's better with you yeah dude something struck me i knew there's something wrong why can't we trust him amen i pray every day god lead me in the word that i might not turn away yes lord because i know if i turn away myself and let satan do it i'm lost and i'm going to hell for doing it there won't be no rewards i know that and i know also that i'm not only going by myself but i'm taking you with me you think they're in a burden you see that's why i am so arrogant and hateful but forgive me for that just look fast and say well really tried that old school teacher you read an old school teacher man they used to they just wear you out and you do something wrong but they didn't mind reaching getting you they didn't have to call home that's mom and dad if it's all right that's right that's the truth he knows when they send home words you got it you're gonna get it again wow why can't we see that in the gospel amen all right look why can't but listen church you remember what we were saying and i'll just do this go back through this one over this evening the same writer when it was once revealed to the prophet that that was the devil that antichrist he didn't say this the antichrist would say oh he just said antichrist no he said that was the devil in a deceptive form he knew that writer was not white and then right and then black and then pale he knew that it was the same old devil but it was different stages of his ministry the horse would signify the other things the boy and new arrows would signify the symbols right so he knew that that red horse rider was going to be telling him he knew that black horse rider is going to be the devil but as i told you they're on the second seal and it's on the third one he said i didn't know this until today you know what you know it was a devil oh he was a developer he didn't know the symbols what those symbols meant until that day he didn't see all of the seals unveiled with the first one but that's where i've always tried to get people to see it i asked you a question many many years ago i said which seal means the most to you some had the fourth don't have to feel somebody's sick someone just said what i see when that first seal broke to me then i had something i knew where i stood that's the most important seal of all is that first seal that's right once you see it's the antichrist then from then on it's just finding out what the symbols mean right amen right and what took place because it's already open to you he said well i like the four field six seven you don't know what they are if you don't go to the first come on i don't mind saying that that's right i've heard people preach the seals that way they just preach here and preach there but if that first seal don't break do you that's right you ain't gonna know what to sacrifice i'm sorry when it broke about the antichrist that prophet knew where he was standing in the end what he wanted was for god to speak each day and tell him the symbols right now when you get over to the fifth we're not going to get this probably for another couple of weeks but i've asked you to read you see a book you're supposed to be reading the third seal now and follow home by reading the fourth all right but when you get to the fifth seal there's no combat bit that's right but there's a key amen because there's a little phrase in that fourth seal that you better study on the combat beast on the four seals had come and see but that was not to calm that beast that screamed out touch not the oil and the wine that was god himself through the lamb i'm quoting brother brown maybe you'll get enough to go read it there's your key to why it's not a field six and seven why because god's come on the scene that's right if these seals don't bring god on the scene then what do we need the seals for everybody said well what do we need them for we don't need no i believe we need them but if it don't bring god on the scene we don't have them i'll just continue on this afternoon we'll make it part two of the third seal and move on from there but i hope you follow me for what i'm saying bring everything down here to where we're at the little deceiving ideas and thoughts that we have brother don't you think that brother has right believe what he wants to constitution says you can right the bible says no that's right show it to me in the bible you got to write believe what you want to do all right come on i'll put that thing around my next song false prophet bring it on show me this bible says it i can believe what i want to believe that's right eve said i think that's all she said wouldn't it come on and it caused all this death for her one little thought you think that we're going to go back with any of those talks what about it 539 response 39 to smartphone you might have any of the alters fear everybody me please is within me oh seeing ourselves we are me me me just think about it now i've got a word i want to say to you and i want you to take it correctly it's not just one sunday school class that we've had some problems with but the children not obeying and doing correctly and following the instructions back to them so now i'm saying to your parents don't think your goody little child is not guilty but you need to have a talk with your kids because sometimes kids get too smart for their own good we respect our elders we respect the teachers and the things that are here if not we will take you to your mother and father we see kids we do the best we can so you do the best you can you obey these people that are teaching you and don't argue back with them and fuss with them about something or ask them why is this and why is that just remember you're a child a teacher is a teacher so now i speak that in love to you children if things anymore we're going to just go to mom and daddy and have a little talk no you don't disrespect nobody school teachers even at school or whatever don't you do don't do it kids don't just don't don't fuss and argue with the school teacher yeah but that's wrong well that's part of your growing part of your growing period right they're doing the best they can they try but most of you won't do what i doing one day we got word something about terence there he was in the eighth grade principal sent home a report on the report i've read it and what did i understand it said check student's folder when i thought it meant he was in somebody else's folder looking around that was just what i thought it meant i called the principal and said i want to know he said no he said sam said i found out later said terence and this boy in his class it wasn't too bad what they were doing said probably shouldn't even come to the office but said these other boys was in bad shape and said they were really needed to be rebuked and said i put them all in together and rebuked them i said you're welcome thank you take care of them they need whipping you take care of it he said i wish all parents was like that but i can't do it i said yeah but the only thing i thought if he was doing something and he shouldn't have done looking in somebody else's material then i'd take care of it but you've taken care of it so if you have any more trouble let me know you see what most of your parents would do if principal called you up and told you you're kidding my kid don't dis don't like that you are to see that's as plain as i can say it absolutely yeah i know one thing kids are kids and no matter what they're going to be kids and some of you ought to remember where you come from because you was a kid at one time and you've done a lot of things don't think your kids are so goody goody okay there's the old dude that's all right you know it's all done in love and understanding father we thank you for this day and we pray that you would bless us and give us understanding of you and we ask that what we've said is worthy of have been said today if not erase it lord from our minds and our thoughts and let us dwell on one thing we're trying to see jesus christ revealed unto each and every one of us in our hearts and lives that we can walk in the day that we're living upon the earth and be what you want us to be because we are the ones that must be under that anointing in the end time that combats all of these things we can't let them get up on us we've got to stand out against it and be what you want us to be we love you we thank you be with everybody give us lord time do we rest and then come back this afternoon in jesus name you're this man me is uh oh me victory oh is
