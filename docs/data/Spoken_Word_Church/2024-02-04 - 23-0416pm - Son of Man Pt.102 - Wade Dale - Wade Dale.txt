========================================

2023 at the Christian Assembly oh Hatchi uh would like to invite you to our annual Memorial meetings May 26th and 27th at 7 and also 28th to 10 I think that's it come on sister Rebecca God bless you all hey man uh feel like I've been up here in a while but um Satan always fighting me he'll fight me before I do something and after I do it so I figure I might well just do it and just deal with it but um I just want to give a quick testimony it happened a while ago and um sometime I don't feel worthy to get up here sometime I feel rough you know like when you've been out in the world for so long you the devil just make you feel rough like you got this Edge on you sometimes like you just rough you know and so I'm just trying to overcome all that and just let God have his will in my life and um make sure it's about him and not about me um this testimony a brother told it but it goes along with my testimony it was a brother that he was getting ready to lose his house and the banks were going to take it and so he had to meet up with his lawyer um the next day he had to meet with his lawyer but that next day also was the same day church service was going on so uh he called his preacher and was like look they're getting ready to take my house and I have to meet with this lawyer today you know so I'm not going to be able to come to church so the brother said the preacher said well come on to church anyway you know put God first God will take care of all that so the brother was in like a you know Bond like brother I got to meet with this lawyer I'm about to lose my house so um anyway the preacher persuaded him just come to church it's a true story just come to church brother God to take care of the rest so the brother went ahead and came to church well the next day the bank called him and he found out they paid off the house nobody understood how it happened why it went that way but the bank ended up taking care of his whole house payment so thank the Lord for that and um it goes with my testimony which is um I had a toothache probably a couple weeks back when um when we had the guest speaker I had a toothache I mean I was trying to sleep on the top of my head just to get rid of this toothache so um I I made a I made it my mission to go to the dentist the next day and uh they did a examine everything my gums were so swollen that it was like the the size of a walnut it was so swollen I couldn't talk I couldn't do anything it was throbbing in my head under my neck back of everything was just out of whack for me so uh they looked at it and was like wow you know we got to get this done so come in the next day which was Saturday and um they told me come in they'll they'll take care of it take it out so um that next day happened to be when we had the guest speaker that Saturday so um I was like well yeah so I came in I went to the dentist and they said um we can take it out just come back at 2:00 and um we'll take care of it for you okay that was the same time my brother Gary was in town and um I was like well yeah yeah I mean this makes sense I got to get this I got to get this taken care of I can't bear it you know and I'm sitting in the car like well okay my appointment at 3: I'll just ask Gary and John to you know take my mom to church with them cuz my mom was standing in my house at the time I said Gary can pick her up she can go to church with them I'll just take care of my tooth well a little small voice was like well you remember that preacher that went to church and God took care of the rest so I said maybe I just yeah I'm I'm going to go that route God can take care of this toothache you know just a little bit of Faith but I'm like God can take care of this so um came to church I decided to come to church and just bear with there I was still in pain but I said I'm going to just go to church and I believe God can take care of this toothache because I don't want to miss it so I came to church I got prayed for I came over here and got prayed for her I asked brother wait for a prayer cloth and I set it right on the right on the um the tooth that was killing me pretty much and uh I sat in the back still in pain and everything but I was like God going to take care of it somehow I went downstairs and um me and the sisters were fellowshipping and stuff I felt that swelling going down uh while we were talking little by little I felt that thing going down whatever was inside of it I felt it coming out it was coming out it was going down I was like oh my God it's happening I even had to tell some of the sisters excuse me but let me give yall this testimony that just happened so I just wanted to share that it was um it happened a couple weeks ago but it was on my heart and I was you know debating if I wanted to come up but God is good and put wonderful wonderful testimony s Rebecca I think that's a perfect example of what brother brandom said if you don't have faith for a toothache Faith puts you in action you see that she she she put that prayer cloth on her and she just believed I'm going to church I'm want to listen to the service and has Faith took care of the rest I think that's a good example of that so we just thank God for healing that toothache amen praise the Lord Jesus let's just sing happy birthday brother Dell happy birthday to you we appreciate the Lord giving you another

song leaders brother Boyd brother Joe all you that fill in brother Michael brother Aaron different ones we sure appreciate it we used to brother Dale used to preach and Lead singing years ago now we got so many song leaders that you know don't know what to do with them so we sure appreciate them cuz they set the tone they're the ones that set the tone for the for the service and and I like us praying and before service and just get the atmosphere started and get the get the anointing going in the right direction so we appreciate each and every one of you let's spow our heads Lord thank you for this afternoon that we've come we come to worship you you said to do it in spirit and in truth so father we pray that our brother has sung the songs and did all the preliminary things that we need to do Lord now I pray as the prophet say he's he's switching into a different anointing to preach so that the people can hear what's you've got to say to them not me Lord I pray that you would open our eyes and open our ears and for those that don't have a heart that's full of you I pray Lord that you'd save their soul lord we still are in this in the business of getting people saved we know that this statue of a perfect man is more for the mature uh as we say adult Christians not in age but in in in stature Lord don't forget the ones that are that are struggling and trying down at Faith Lord just reach and and grab them Lord and and hug them up and and Lord may they do as as Jacob did of old just wrestle with you all night and get it all fought out and Lord Jacob walked different when you left him but he looked and saw a lad and saw angels ascending and descending up into heaven and coming back lord I pray that that's what we'll see in this stature of a perfect man Lord we see the Angels ascending and descending back and forth but you came on the scene Jacob didn't wrestle with an angel he wrestled with you and Lord you touched him Lord Jesus I pray that you'd touch us today touch us all in a special way that maybe you've never touched us before that we'll be more like you Lord that we'll be more patient and will be more temperent with the people and Lord have strength to give that virtue out and Lord the knowledge not the kind that puffeth up but the knowledge that we we know as the prophet of God said we read it we know that little nod that when it comes to a place we know what's going on we know that you're on the scene father we pray now be with the ones that are sick that are not here Lord the ones that are listening in I pray that you'd be with each one be with brother Dale Lord now is his birthday we pray that you'd just give him any more and forgive us of our sins and bless us Lord take care of us to further in this service Jesus name we pray amen all right part 102 so in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God we're going to get the godliness and maybe get into brotherly kindness a little bit and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of what Grace and Truth Grace and Truth all right as we were talking this morning you don't know anything about Grace until you get born again you just don't you can't cuz you're standing born again and your sins are being chopped off your sins are being done away with and under the grace of God we are as we were talking this morning as we'll speak a little bit more about how God's washed us up God's took us and took the wrinkles out he's took the spots out he's took the sin out he's took the part of humanity that we struggle with and he's took all that out all right and what do you do he put him inside and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness now we continue on and godliness brotherly kindness we're going to spend a little while follow on brotherly kindness cuz I got a few Avenues I want to go there and to brotherly kindness charity we're almost up to the Capstone then we can start in the seals and the different things and we talk about the son of man which we started 10 and something Services ago so 1 Timothy 316 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seene of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into Glory you may be SE Lord as his Blessing for the reading of his word now we know that word we look cont without controversy or without Strife or without dispute or without a quarrel there's nothing that you can say that's going to change the word of God so guess what we have to do we have to change ourself to the word of God not away from it all right uh I have my own thoughts you have your own thoughts but but those thoughts have got to do as we were talking in knowledge that knowledge is not worldly knowledge that knowledge is not as as uh Chris was talking this weekend about the Hubble telescope and that other one that's named after that other guy that can see a million miles that's okay that's man's natural knowledge and they're getting into artificial intelligence and all these different things where a computer supposedly thinks for us well well praise God I need it every once in a while but uh you know I mean you can be you can be talking about a buying a Chevrolet car and what pops up about 5 minutes later on your phone there's an ad for some Chevrolet place now that's kind of weird and then you've got I know the computer guys you got algorithms and all these different things that if you continue to go down this road with something you get inundated with all these uh uh ads and popups and all these things well that's artificial intelligence but what about the intelligence of God that takes us past that million miles listen if you're born again today a million miles means nothing to you a million miles is just like that because you've travel like I thought hund and something Thousand Miles a second then guess what million miles are just like going from here to Commerce all right so we see it that way and that's to me that's the knowledge but look at this right here so forn knowledge we talk about the forn knowledge of God and I really want you we may cover predestination again a little bit later on but brother Dale's covered it a 100 times and we ought to be pretty settled in it that those he forne so for knowledge is first if you put for knowledge first uh don't get me wrong for but forget about predestination because predestination is like brother Bram said it's a bad word to use in a untrained crowd because predestination does mean predetermined Destiny all right and that is a tube and that is that's not where he pulls you through though and you don't have a choice that's because he saw brother George what you would do therefore he could predetermine this whole world to me that's so simple not that he predestined first and then by then then he used his for knowledge no he uses for knowledge first because it's called for okay knowledge all right so to me that's just as simple as it can be and then we have to keep it separated though when we talk about the genes of God and the gene seed of God and all these different things that people are are talking about in the message and realize one thing's for sure when the prophet of God makes a statement he's in the mind of God and then he's over here talking to Sinners so there's two different things as we were talking about this morning he's not saying two different things now brother R is not that confused same way we're talking about with Daniel 70 weeks they said well I've got these quotes and we've got these quotes and they just fight each other this message don't fight each other the message is right you just don't understand and I don't understand what's going on until the Lord what gives us holy ghost knowledge and you know what by for knowledge God knew that this group of people now I'm going to say it this group of people inside this building today by for knowledge God knew you would want good teaching correct teaching and not another Ministry or you would be somewhere else I mean really you'd be a lot of people are built though they need somebody that's you know up and down the aisles and running back and forth and screaming and hollering and just you know preaching God s a prophet and you know be a good Christian and love each other and that's okay but what about this what about more add to I want the add to part and that's kind of what we're all well you know we're we're born underneath that and and you know sometimes we we as ministers we we do we like people to be emotional and not be you know sitting back with their finger stuck in there anyway um nose or wherever more but um and not be sleepy and try to be attentive but we know the the um old man said one time he said the mind can only endure what the backside can so um yeah the mind can only comprehend what the back side can endure so we know that we have to endure but listen you have to fight fight be brave against all evil why fight fight it don't bring your pillow and your blanket and your cold drink and oh anyway yeah get all cozy and warm and make you a nest fight it we all fight it we all do we all fight it but you know what that's the overcoming part he that overcometh will I give these things not he that sleepeth he that overcometh that thing all right so Christ Min God revealed we talking about for knowledge we got that out of the way so back part in the back part of God's mind he saw though there was something he was going to achieve now who's he going to achieve it through he's going to achieve it through people so he saw by for knowledge someone that would come together under this word of God and live it like God said it not like man said it not like this over here said but like God said it so he was going and trying to achieve now why would he why would he even make a plan if he didn't see the end result of it so you and I make a plan we want to build a house we want to do this and that and the other and and sometimes we change one thing thousand times but God can't put a plan together and it failed he can't put a plan together and it not work you know why cuz if for knew do you know if we knew today everything we were going to do tomorrow it'd be a lot easier do you remember you understand that it'd be a lot easier because we've got so many we don't know if the car's going to start tomorrow we don't know if we going to get fired from our job tomorrow we don't know if the government's going to take over Tom tomorrow according to Tony it is so Mark too sorry brother Mark but anyway government ain't got nothing to do with this there's one government that does and that's the government of God he does have a government because the Bible said the government was on his shoulders all right so who wherever the government government is it's on God's shoulders and I'm not worried about it but you don't you do but we do worry though we worry cuz tomorrow's news is going to be there's another killing or there's another this or another that there's always that that question mark but what if you knew everything was going to happen from today till the day of the Rapture it'd make things a lot easier or hard if you were on the bad side but it would make it easier and that's the way God is he's not nervous so what am I dependent on I'm not depending on me knowing what's tomorrow I'm depending on the guy that knows and holds tomorrow all right that's who I'm depending on and I want to get to know him better if you get to know him better then you get more intimate with that person and you get to know that person a little bit more so that's why I this whole thing is about intimacy that's right the marriage happened right here when you got born again you got married now Mom and Dad's been married 65 years the they ever sto not knowing it yeah they know each other really well but tomorrow there'll be something else that come up right cuz we're humans but you get to know each other that's why I want us to get to know God cuz look if brother said God's got a secret mystery it's got to be revealed to us because the Bible tells us that in the days of the seventh angel all these Mysteries all this mystery not Mysteries mystery would be revealed and that's what we're going to get into when we get into the stat into the uh headstone is the revealing of all Mysteries we know now now even today we're picking a mystery at a time and we're looking at like the mystery of water baptism the mystery of predestination the mystery of all these different Mysteries now it's so common we've we've got it in the building you know uh we're building a new um uh couple of restrooms there at the uh at the city of Gillsville and you know we don't know how it's going to go cuz well we got the plans all done but you know you can I can see the foundation as they laid the blocks all right now hopefully 90 days from now I'm not going to worry about that Foundation cuz it's already built it's already done I'm not going to go out there and make sure they put the foundation no the building is built it's built on something so if we have our foundation there's no reason to go back as the Bible says don't go back and try to rebuild that Foundation that's what I was saying this morning listen if you get in trouble we don't get in trouble if you get in trouble don't say well I must be lost I want to get baptized again I want to receive the Holy Ghost I want to be Sanctified somewhere you going to have to say this is it you can only get wet so many times all right but if you'll settle down and say just look God forgive me of what I done and I'm going on problem is is we get bogged down and we go the other way we need to just give just give God the glory and say God I'm messed up and keep going that way right that's all of us keep going forward never go backwards there's nothing backwards in God yes so he was going to achieve it how was he going to achieve it through me and you and he was going to let himself be expressed how's he going to be expressed through us the First Corinthians says so that you be come behind and no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus look who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of Our Lord I want us to make sure we understand that I got all these quotes about that the whole Bible's full of them how he's going to make you spotless he's going to make you without wrinkle he's going to make you sons of God Philippians 2 you may be blameless now what is blameless you stole today you robbed a bank at 12:00 did he no cuz I saw you you were here so now you are blameless no one can bring now somebody can bring an accusation but there's so many a great cloud of witnesses that were here okay that saw Michael downstairs at 12:00 so that cloud of witness has made him blameless and harmless there's no way that they can judge him for robbing the bank he was here that's what God is doing for me and you amen he's taking our sins away making us blameless and harmless listen you and we have that we have that balance we say well brother B says said we sin every day now you're telling us that we're sinless and blameless the balance of the is is how to handle that in between we're going to sin okay we're going to have sins only Christians have sins okay we're going to sin but if we know how to handle it it never gets to God and it makes us blameless blameless everybody with me we know how the world doesn't know how listen the world doesn't even know how to say I'm sorry you know what it is it's somebody else's fault it's the government's fault so anyway no it's your fault my fault if we don't make it don't blame me don't blame brother Dale blame yourself self well don't get quiet on me now but I'm looking at a group of people that can be blameless and harmless sons of God look without rebuke if you do what God Said how's he going to rebuke you how you going to be rebuked in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation well we know we that among whom you shine as lights in the world how we shine cuz we have a statue of a perfect man that that God is now living we see I was talking to somebody the other day the the Methodist Church is just in a turmoil for those of you that know that uh they're they're suing everybody they're all suing each other churches are suing churches yeah because one you know they said you can have a a gay woman preacher and the others like ain't having that so they're splitting because of that and they're just pointing fingers at each other now that's what a denomination has come down to in this end time is that they're fighting over something that should be really obvious and I like what our neighbor said Jay Ferguson I talked to him the other day he said I'm just going to build my own church that's where I'm going so but you see what see what we've come to you and I are coming we're here and we are solidified we've got a foundation we know where the the word of God is we know where God is we know what he's doing and where he's at and then the world don't have a clue well is he over here cuz there's a group of people that's going to let that woman standing in front of them they had a picture of one woman the other day at a Methodist Church had on a black robe with a white thing you know the little whatever you call it the Rope or whatever you say right here and it's rainbow colors all the way down he about that long no we have the right interpretation we have the right message and God's going to vindicate it through us not them but we've got to get into what we've got to get in a condition that God can use us amen but by having all these virtues working in our life that's how God can do it we have patience a man who's not swerve you you've seen people and so have I we'll just talk about this a little bit and then we'll if we don't go too far we won't we'll go eat some cake and ice cream but you see people that are and not just message people I'm talking about out in the world you see people that have no patience you look at them when they have no patience their world is just one big bomb they have no patience for this no patience for that no patience for the guy that cuts them off in the road and they give them that one finger wave there's no patience there's nothing to steer them in the right direction you and me if they cut you off in the middle in the middle of traffic so what right what are you worried about you said well that's just kind of no it's getting bad it's getting where people are shooting each other because you pull them you know you pull in front of them they going to shoot you road rage just killed a bunch of people several in Atlanta not too many weeks from now you know back but now you and I are not part of that there comes a time when we've got to separate ourself when when we get in a car a real car when we get in a car that we're not inundated with all the junk and the fil and all that stuff that's going on right and we don't have ill feelings toward people we don't have ill feelings toward the the the guy in front of you or the guy behind you well get quiet if you want to but I'm talking to every one of us now but we have a deliberate purpose that's why we can be patient we don't have to scream and holler at somebody when they cut us off or or when somebody does us wrong we're going to get in brotherly kindness and it's going to hurt us all but someone that but then you see somebody even a worldly person that's just as patient he's meticulous he don't jump into everything all the time and he's really successful because he doesn't dive in as brother rown says people that go out past God's plan and they become a wreck but then you do see people that become wrecked all the time just even in the natural world but what about the spiritual world what about us what about us today are we waiting on God are we not waiting on God I was thinking the other day I watched the cartoon way a long time ago and it was two um pheasants and there was two pheasants and and you know in the old in the old black and white days you you saw you heard the Hunters coming you heard the shooting you know well these two pheasants are are side by side hunkered down in a cornfield Corn's about that high hunker down in the cornfield and and one of them one of them looks at the other one and says don't move we got this don't move they'll walk by us don't move and the other one's like this I don't know if I can wait he's real close I don't know if I can wait well you see a boot come in picture so they're that close to him and the says just wait stay right here just wait stay you don't worry about him and the other one says I can't wait he's too close I got to go and then you see him you know you see him fly off out of the picture and you hear pom p and that other one you know down he like I told him that's the same way that's the same way with us listen to somebody be patient let God do his work be patient the devil's wanting to shoot every one of us but be patient be patient where your you're at at the moment but don't stay there but be patient be like that Fe be patient and tell others be patient and don't make a choice and go flying off cuz you get shot but that's the way it is in the world you know that it is you say hang on hold on no got to go gotta go get out of here unless we suffer we can't rain with him I love this quote it just keep coming up you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is a character is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift does everybody understand that statement it's a victory when you have character it is a victory it is a battle that you have won and overcome not a gift that says here here's your patience my buddy just use it all any way you want to no no no no no you have to fight for that patience you have to fight for that virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness a man without without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character that's what God's looking for see we're coming into the stage of adoption I was listening to somebody uh the other day and they they just roll adoption into your new birth well now brother brandham says and I'll read you a quote where brother brandham says and I agree with I have to well I won't say that I get bad shape I don't need brother R to quote tell me that your new birth is different from your adoption I can read it in my Bible and I can see it in myself that the new birth is totally different from you got to have the new birth you got to have faith but it doesn't automatically make you adopted it doesn't automatically make you a manifested son and daughter of God you got to grow into that you got to have a what a tutor and a governor according to the book of Galatians you got to have a school Master somebody to what teach you bring you to Christ teach you how to stay hunker down in the corn field when the Hunter start coming but Power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne if he's required it folks he's got to make a way so here's the way all right here's the way it's the Bible prophet's message that's the way that's the way we make it we're not going to make it with James doton we're not going to make it now he's a nice guy good good fell but he's not somebody that I want to listen to all the time the little temporary sufferings we go through is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes and oh what Treasures let's continue on let's skip through some of this the Lord is not slack concerning his promises he's longsuffering thank God he is longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but all would come to repentance now brother Ram also said look faith alone won't do it we read that a million times but listen I want you to understand something you can you go read and I'll try to find it where Paul says you can have all that and not have charity not have the new birth sounding brass and a tinkling symbol in other words you really have nothing to say right now he made ready and had faith in the promise this is Abraham father of our faith we can still have faith in the promise and not obey it it'll still hinder us let I was saying this morning you only really believe what you obey think about that you really only believe what you obey if you don't believe coming to church is important you won't so you're not going to obey it because you don't believe it all right and put other thing everything else in there then brother R talk about have patience with who patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have genuine patience because Faith worketh patience all right we'll continue on here a little bit skip through some of this but they that wait upon the Lord Lord shall renew their strength Mount up with wings as Eagles run and not be weary walk and not faint we should have patience with one another when we get to brotherly kindness I'm going to tie those two together to have patience because brother ra talks about having patience with your brother if he's off the word or different things I I don't I want us to understand that that that being off the word is not not horrible if you hear the right word and then come to it we've all done that everyone brother Dale preached one time I mean he was preaching away and something came to me I'm like man I ain't never seen like that before well I was ignorant back over here but when I come to the light or the knowledge of the truth there was something inside of me that took me to that not away from it all right it it brings me to that and that's what the school Master does even on up front he brings you to Christ tell knows you where he's at what he's doing and what he saying to you not your neighbor not your wife you what he saying to you we should have patience with one another he said it's hard to do I've tried to have patience 33 years women still Bob their hair still just the same but just have patience brother Brown did have to if you ain't got it don't try to build it that Hebrews tells about laying every weight aside run with patience the race that's set before us enduring the cross he endured the cross he that endureth to the end shall be saved what's the scripture he that starts a good work in me in other words he's going to finish it all right if you let him start that good word inside of you or that work all right endureth means to remain abide not recede or flee in other words uh first little problem that we have we disappear first little problem we have and you quit going to church and then you start making excuses well stay here stay under the fountain stay here long enough until God works on you not us till God works on you all right and we got those who endure to the end shall be saved all right let's go to Godliness just for a minute I got to there's a few more I want you to I want to read here it's reverence and respect this is where we kind of got this morning piety towards God our godliness and then he requires that we have this but he also shows us a form of godliness and that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon and we'll get to it here in just a minute let's continue through here fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean he talks about to be like God after you got faith and all those things then be like God oh yes you can they said no can't do that brother Brown yes yes you can all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you well I don't know if I believe that well guess what then you're not going to obey it if you don't believe it you're not going to obey it I'm going to keep that that's my new favorite phrase be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect if he said it he had to make a way for us to do it now he even said that 2,000 years ago listen to me with a group of people that wasn't even born again yet amen right they were just Justified and Sanctified they had not been born again they had not went to the upper room you get way up here now before you're asked to do this though all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things can I say on that line he continues on I'm going to just keep skipping through this so we'll not be so long today some of you already checked out so we'll see if we can hurry up a a man that's born again a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he's part of the word of God in other words he does what the word says that's just pretty simple he does what the word says and listen we don't all do what the word says all the time okay sorry about that right he's part of the word of God and then this last day of this bride taking form exactly the same power that he was at the beginning has come up through these organizations see he didn't do away with organizations God moved through those organizations and then what come out for the bride which is us he can't do nothing but that see those denominations had to come God had to move through the Baptist to see that we do believe in eternal security if it's taught the right way right we do believe in predestination if it's talked the right way not like Calvinism or Armenian ISM it bring it back together and that's the way it is all right we don't believe in in uh Trinity because we know a different but they Tau a trinity all the way through even even U three of the church agent Messengers were trinitarians Columba Luther and Wesley they were trinitarians but God winked at their ignorance and we look back and quote Wesley and we look back and quote Luther all right but that's okay to quote them and then move forward move forward into God and not move backwards I think you know what I do we'll just all be lutherans now from now on everybody be lutherans okay and you can talk to each other at the beer store then some of y'all get that but you that's what I mean the lutherans you what their founder smoked a pipe and drank beer right but was a church a messenger I we know better see when I said that you're like no we don't do that right well we don't do that no we don't do that why because God's moved up listen folks I'm telling you you and I are astronauts we are able to take this pressure if you're not able to take this pressure you're not want to hits cuz you have been put in this age to take the pressure listen the has been put in this age not to fail so he gave us amen he gave us the pressurized suit he gave us the intelligence of God not the intelligence of man that we can get into a spaceship and we can go out as far as a million miles or whatever more we can see you think the mind of God's Just A Million Miles Away the mind of God's Eternal and brother B said let's go back into his mind we just went right back into millions and billions of miles right just like that first Timothy said for Kings he's talking about prayers and intercessions giving thanks that we may lead a quiet and Peaceable life in all godliness and honesty now that one we have to work on all right all of us all sometimes especially when you got kids and U you got kids running around and and and uh it don't seem like it's quiet and and uh orderly but that's not what God's talking about he's talking about you not getting upset and throwing things at them when that does happen somebody says well I'm can't be throwing stuff now let's read this right here I told you in Timothy he says a lot about Paul says a lot about being Godly I will there I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands some of yall ought tried that without wrath and doubting in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broidered hair or gold or pearls or costly array but now watch in parentheses take that parentheses away and and Paul is just saying but with good works right but he's interpolating or he's making a he's bringing his thought process out that says which becometh women professing godliness do you know if you walk down the street and you look Godly and you look you look like the you know the the well if you look like the fashion of the world and all that you know there's no godliness there I mean man you see some of these people going to church and I was looking uh one a friend of ours had a a daughter went to a went to a junior senior or whatever is it junior senior time I guess it is prom prom night Lord they want enough material in that girl's dress to for nothing and the guy she was with had his hand right where he shouldn't have his hand they're just going to a party that's what the world's producing now sisters little kids don't let somebody touch you like that and don't put on something that'll provoke that we want to become women professing godliness with good words you see Paul's Paul Paul comes out and he he's he's really telling the um women to Adorn them themselves in modest apparel and he keeps talking he keeps telling the women you know you don't supposed to PE in church and you're supposed to be uh you know silent and all those things but look what he says in verse 10 he says but which becometh women professing godliness with good works so he's putting them on a pedestal as brother Bram you know the the the brother asked me one time he said he's not in the message anymore but he said why did Brother Brown call women dog meat I I said he didn't call you women dog meat I said he called that kind of woman dog meat listen without the new birth we're dog meat we're Canon father if we if we don't have the new birth but it's just something you pick with everybody wants to pick pick on this and pick on that listen brother Bram always gave honor to a good godly woman always gave honor to a good godly woman always did never did he be little a Godly woman but when they're turned into all those other things like brother R said he's right they can send more people to Hell than never be join in this in the country walking down the street with no clothes on like they did at the prom I'd hate to go to them proms now I'm telling you even when we went to proms 50 years ago June had a dress on that was up to here had long sleeves not anymore but that's what the world's come to because they don't have God they're Godless they don't have godliness they're Godless let the women learn in Silence with all subjection now if you look at that now that when when Paul's talking about godliness right there that godliness interpretation in the Greek is reverence toward God's goodness not yours toward God's goodness it's worshipper of God are worshiping God you know why he's the sisters you know what you're doing right there you're worshiping God when you're professing godliness you don't have to be in a church you don't have to be in a church sitting you can be walking down Walmart and condemn the whole place cuz you're walking Godly and then that's going to tell the world that you're worshiping God cuz remember you only believe what you obey think about that you keep thinking about you only the only thing you care about is what you believe in right if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up into the words of faith and good Doctrine where unto thou Hast attained but refuse profane an old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is now watch having promise of the life that now is if you live Godly all right you're going to be okay on this side and on the other side right look at that having promis of the life that is now and the life which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation in other words you need to accept what we just told you 1 Timothy 6:3 said If any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness he is proud knowing nothing wow but doting about questions and strife of words whereof cometh Envy Strife railing evil surmising perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth pretty bad characters supposing that gain is godliness H I'm successful so I must be Godly I'm successful so I must be Godly no that don't mean one thing from such withdraw thyself get away from that but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain that we're g GNA carry nothing else out with us never seen a caset full of money nope but that word contentment look what it means sufficiency watch this a perfect condition of life in which no Aid or support is needed that's contentment sufficiency of the necessities of life a mind contented with its lot I told them at work the other day and and just a little story about a government um they redid our routes and they re-evaluated our our routes when you work for the Post Office you get um evaluation time for for every box you do every package you deliver all the scans you do it's just a bunch of stuff added together and that's your salary well like mine was was uh mine was estimated at 5 and 1/2 hours a day and U which is part-time but I do get benefits but and I like it that way because I'm usually finished by about 12:00 but I usually get it done in 3 and a half to 4 hours so there's an hour and a half there that I get paid that I I can be sitting home taking a nap well anyway so and I and I'm okay with that that should be but the other day they came in and they upset the apple card they took and re-evaluated all that instead of giving us two minutes for a box they give us a minute and a half so it cut my salary $100 a week down to about 4 hours evaluated time and that's about what I got but they were and and it is one of the girls there she makes about 80 grand a year and she's only going to make 72 she's going to lose about $88,000 a year but I told him you know the Bible tells us you know what John told us what John tell us John the Baptist told those two soldiers he said be content with your wages and I explained to him the other day I said look I said how can you live in a town of 300 people in Gillsville drive 10 miles to work have no traffic and still make $72,000 a year I said don't complain be content with what you got I can't stand people that argue about what the government or or what your job does to you if you live Godly and you have you know how to handle that cuz you know what it'll eat your soul it's going to eat some of them up there's thousands of people in across across the country that's getting ready to either quit they're going to strike I think they walked on Washington today they they you know got their picket lines and all that stuff and that's okay because we don't want listen we don't want people to walk over us right there's a big difference we don't want people to walk over us but we want to be content and say hey for what I make and for what I do I'm fine I'm good I'm okay godliness with contentment is what gain gain that's right I'd rather gain that not that out there but that what he's talking about than to gain the whole world and lose my soul that know what the scripture says now that's not saying you don't make yourself better try to do better try to make more money but if something like that happens you it'll eat you to death and it'll make you just make you have a horrible Life Second Timothy 3:1 I'm not going to charge you for that one that was a Dave Ramsey John's like you going to use that next time okay everybody enjoy brother John talking to us about yeah I mean really good he said well it ain't got nothing to do with the word it absolutely does every bit of it does you know why we don't like it cuz we don't do it praise the Lord Ain that right second Timothy 3 verse one I am I I this is what you get I brother R Spencer was preaching away the other day and he was talking about something and he said hey don't get your panties in a wad and he stopped for about two seconds he said hey that's the way we roll around here get over it this know this that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be what lovers of their own self boy ain't that today selfies Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy well without natural affection we see that also truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good you know junor and I were doing something the other day and we filled out a a form and it said what was your gender at Birth not what's your gender now it's what was your gender at Birth you had to put male or female one of the two I I just can't believe well I can too despisers of those that are good tra traitors he high- minded lovers of pleasures more than the lovers of God having a form of godliness now this is what we're going to get into and then we'll stop right here but denying the power having a form of godliness just doing just enough to get by from such turn away now anointed ones at the end time listen to this otherwise if he wanted to break it down so we would more or less understand it better he would say in the last days there shall come false anointed ones now that seems almost impossible see the term of anointed but notice the very next words false prophets p r o p h e TS plural now anointed one is one with a message all right stick with me here for just a second we'll go eat some cake y'all be awake for that I promise you you won't face won't and the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed and that would be a prophet anointed there shall rise false anointed teachers a prophet teaches what his message is Anointed teachers look but anointed people with false teaching anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural and if there is such a thing as Christ singular then these would have to be anointed ones that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because they are anointed ones anointed you may say how can this be what were they Christ CH r s TS false prophets anointed ones Jesus said the rain falls on the just and the unjust now watch this now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false there's you form of godliness but denying the power thereof now listen close and see what he said and they shall show signs and wonders in so much it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit only the son of man in the end time is going to distinguish those two Spirits cuz when Jesus was standing in the upper room there was 12 people there right one of them was the devil or anointed by the devil his name was Judas not one person knew except the son of man he knew who that was because he could discern the spirit that was in that person because listen he somebody said somebody said Lord who is it he said it's the one that spped the ball with me right the Bible says Judas reached over and soed the bowl and they still didn't see it so they were deceived we're going to be deceived if we don't have that kind of godliness right because we're heading toward the headstone we're heading toward that it's going to be a brother Brown said a Razor's Edge and they are anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit I know this sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and explain it by the word that that's absolutely thus sayith the Lord the truth let's continue reading this is Anointed ones at the end time but remember that Pentecostal Church in the last days was a lay out of sea and Christ was turned out the kernel the wheed itself when he tried remember when he tried to manifest himself in the the church he was thrown out or taken out it was still a church claimed to be anointed cus stayed anointed even though he put Jesus on the cross right but watch but here is the word Christ himself that's the anointed word which shall come for the rest of his body the bride the anointed of the same water that watered the wheat as we talked about also Waters the tears anointed ones only the elected are predestinated now that's predestinated God knowing who would do who would take it and who wouldn't will be able to detect the difference will be able to detect the difference between them now Ephesians 5:1 tells you so and about and about how it was they are anointed ones everybody says glor glory to God we got freedom down here hallelujah oh Hallelujah we speak in tongues and jump we got freedom of the women you try to put them under all these kinds of things see go ahead there ain't nothing you can do say well we speak in tongues we shout we dance in the spirit we preach the word absolutely not one thing to say against it so do these people back here in the Bible Jesus said it'll deceive the very elected if it were possible the very elected now he's talking about having a form of godliness listen it only lets the wheat be known to the elected which are part of it notice how beautiful this is brought here only the notice the anointed ones be able the true elected predestinated Ephesians 5 or 1: 15 rather will be ordained elected they're the only ones that it will not deceive notice the anointed prophets will be false and there among it will be true anointed how you going to tell it by the word how you going to tell it by the word like we have it in Shadow do you see it congregation says amen notice the anointed ones only the word will separate them not the signs oh when we get up here to this godliness brother way we just going to shout speaking you can I wish you would but that doesn't mean that you're at that godliness it means you can have a form of that godliness they'll do the same signs but the words what separated them sure they all prophesied they all done this that and the other sure just the same Jesus said they do the same but the word is what separated them notice not signs brother ramam said in North it's not I want you to see he he clarified he's talking about preaching this last Sunday right here this was the Sunday after that at the Tabernacle he said see they are anointed they're Spirits are anointed in the second realm anybody with me in the second realm which is what memory reason conscious affection imagination first realm is either Faith or doubt it's not both all right you're either born again today or you're not if you're born again you're sealed in to the day of your Redemption amen if you're not born again today you can be among that group of anointed ones to where your souls as black as such and your spirit gets anointed by the truth baptism of the Holy Ghost and you speak in tongues preach the gospel see signs and wonders do signs and wonders but it doesn't get all the way down that's why the new birth that Bible was talking about this morning the new birth is the most important thing that you'll ever get is to know that God's in your soul not anointing your spirit and not making you feel good not making you jump and Shout today brother R talks right here we finish right here Christ revealed in his own word today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed it's where them to tape on false anointed ones or anointed ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still be a devil still be a devil so what's the most important thing speaking in tongue shouting no know that you got the new birth know that you got the new birth that you're sealed out God sealed in Satan sealed out God sealed in and sealed to the day of your Redemption then now we are working on that next realm that Spirit realm we're trying to drive those evil spirits out is everybody with me that's what this statue of perfect man is it's driving out the other demons you think Satan wants you to prosper he wants you to fail so he's going to he's going to fight for your soul when he loses that guess what he's going to fight for he ain't leaving town he ain't leaving town folks he just goes out in your spirit realm and starts in your memory Reon conscious effects and Imagination and starts working there and make you miserable right if you'll let him all right let's talk a me about brotherly kindness and then we'll stop right here besides this giving all diligence add to your faith ver diverse knowledge everybody understand there's two forms of godliness being Godly and having a form of godliness but deny the power of that godliness all right from such turn away so we need to there's going to be a separating time we're not going to have to do it God will do it and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity we're getting on up there you know that means Philadelphia which is brotherly love love of the brethren look love of brothers or sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren our another part of that is love as Brethren loving brother or sister and a broader sense loving one like a brother loving one's fellow Countryman of an Israelite or a Christian loving Christians after you've done come here to here to here to here to here now you're coming into the full stature now of a son of God but you got to have this plus all this and you can't even start unless you get this I believe he was pointing it down at the bottom everybody with me he was pointing at the bottom at Faith now remember the black bird with the peacock feathers don't forget him don't try to add it till you're actually born again cuz it won't work and you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here genuine Born Again Dove then you don't add nothing it it adds to you see comes on up all right coming into Perfection now sixthly let's add Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness now that's a good one here 6 seven all right adding brotherly kindness when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him what Jesus tell him not just seven times a day 70 * 7 brotherly kindness now you see if for Brothers All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no be kind to him go anyway I'm going to read you some quotes where brother B talks about he's going into an area and he's going to preach well now he's a prophet right he's a church age messenger everybody supposed to listen to him right just just fold the doors back and you know come on in brother VanDam I'll read you several quotes where I'll tell you about what true brotherly kindness is cuz you know what he could be that way he could have said bless God if you don't listen to me you're out cuz you know what I'm telling you now if you don't listen to him you're out but he's not going to say that he says go ask your pastor if you need healing go ask your pastor if you can come to the meeting he said but if you got a post of Duty he said you need to be in your church he said now if y'all don't have a meeting set up it'd be all right for y'all to come to our meeting that's brotherly kindness somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way they do and still go to the Assemblies of God in Oneness then put see brotherly kindness come on musicians we'll sing a song or two and then we'll go downstairs hoping someday look see patience with him see Temperance enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes and I appreciate that we brother Dale all the different ones we we we try to understand we listen to what people saying we try to understand what they're what they're getting at what they're getting you know what they're getting to to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in Praise the Lord brotherly kindness the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven brother R Taps on the chalkboard see the seventh thing now look he said now now we're coming let's stand to our feet putting everything together brotherly kindness you'd think well man I'm born again I love everybody and everybody loves me wrong wrong cuz we'll talk about a little bit later we'll head and look at that old nature cuz that old nature you put two kids in a room with one toy most of you y'all are laughing you know what that's going to be chaos somebody going to get a tail whiiing cuz somebody says that's mine give it to me that's mine give it to me no it's mine give it to me no mine give it to me right that's our nature our nature is not to be kind to people each other why do you see all this road rage why do you see all these people killing that boy that killed all them people up here in Tennessee he had a GP with those six people or five people people they how me he killed he had a grip with them so he just went and killed them wow that didn't come from God but if he killed your daddy would you pray for his soul or would you get mad at him H oh it's different when you bring it home yeah that man kills your daddy cuz somebody's daddy died there was three men and a couple women and there that got killed could you say I forgive him and mean it and mean it no we still have that same nature we got to F with that if you do this to me I'm going to do that to you all right so let's work on that that's why brotherly kindness is really rough it's tough to be really to have brotherly kindness but we're going to have it because God required us to have it so we're going to have it we're going to have it right let's sing a song God bless you never been a day like this day to me there has [Music] [Applause] never I see there has never been a light that shine in the darkest Church age there's a

that's why that sign's on up above the door uh as you come in says today I Give My All to Jesus Christ um brother darl Ward said that was over the Tennessee football um thing and you our old football coach told us one time he said if You' give everything you got everything you've got on that field he said I don't care if we get beat you know 50 to nothing you just give everything you got and do we do that with God or do we reserve a peace and say well I think I'll I think I'll hold back a little bit when we come to church service we should give it all to God everything we got every effort we got like I said before to stay awake every effort we got to be here on time every effort there's no way you will fail if you'll do the things God asked you to do I said if you'll do the things God asked you to do you'll never fail it's just when we start not doing those things is when we fail and we ought to know one thing for sure you're not in the will of God when you're not in the will of God right you're just not you're not in the will of God when you don't do what he says but we're trying we're heading that way we're heading in that direction not leaving anybody behind getting all we can get taking all we can take with us pulling every piece scratching clawing trying our best everybody we all should do that give our effort give our all and love till they just no more love I could
