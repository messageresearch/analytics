[28:44] and revealed them to babes such as would
[28:47] learn we know that the scripture the
[28:49] Bible is not like a newspaper that
[28:51] there's a there's a meaning behind each
[28:54] phrase and each line in that scripture

[29:22] destruction so now as we open back your
[29:24] word Lord just bless the speaker bless
[29:26] the hearer father in Jesus name amen
[29:30] Matthew 28:16 now we're going to talk on
[29:33] water baptism today and we're going to
[29:35] use the
[29:36] scripture and let's just see what we can
[29:39] get into um Matthew 28:16
[29:42] says then the 11 disciples went away
[29:46] into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus
[29:48] had appointed them now the reason it was
[29:50] 11 was What Judas was already he had
[29:53] already hung himself he was he was dead
[29:55] so they were looking for number 12 they
[29:57] only had 11 there so the 11 disciples
[30:00] went away into Galilee into a mountain
[30:02] where Jesus had appointed them and when
[30:04] they saw him they worshiped him but some
[30:07] doubted H and Jesus came and spake unto
[30:11] them saying all
[30:13] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[30:17] Earth go ye therefore and teach All
[30:20] Nations now look this is the order
[30:24] go
[30:26] go
[30:28] teach
[30:30] preach
[30:32] baptize all right go teach and baptize
[30:35] that's what Jesus said and I'm tell
[30:36] talking about another man Jesus said
[30:38] this all right go ye therefore and teach
[30:40] All Nations baptizing in in the name of
[30:45] the father that that's not names that's
[30:48] name name of the father and of the son
[30:52] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[30:56] observe all things whatso ever I have
[30:58] commanded you and lo I am with you all
[31:01] way praise God even unto the end of the
[31:05] world Amen you may be seated in The Lord
[31:07] At His blessings to reading his word but
[31:10] that word baptism comes from the word
[31:13] baptizo all right our baptized are to
[31:16] immerse are submerged we don't believe
[31:19] in sprinkling we believe that Jesus was
[31:21] baptized because the Bible says when he
[31:22] came up out of the water that that kind
[31:25] of means he was down in the water when
[31:26] he came up out of the water we read that
[31:28] scripture in a minute but I want to show
[31:30] you something here in water baptism we
[31:32] know it's truly
[31:34] important but listen to what um we've
[31:37] read this before but maybe for for
[31:39] Anna's family that this comes out of the
[31:41] Greek Lexicon and this is the Greek word
[31:43] for baptized This Is How They This Is
[31:45] How They tell us what the word baptizo
[31:48] means or is an example of says the
[31:51] clearest example that shows the meaning
[31:53] of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet
[31:55] and and physician nikander
[31:58] who lived about 200 BC it's a recipe for
[32:01] making
[32:02] pickles you didn't know you going to get
[32:05] a you know you going to get a lesson on
[32:07] making pickles today did
[32:08] you it's a recipe for making pickles and
[32:11] helpful because it uses both words
[32:14] Baptist and baptizo bapto and
[32:17] baptizo nikander says that in order to
[32:19] make a pickle the vegetables should
[32:22] first be dipped
[32:24] bapto into boiling water and then
[32:26] baptized
[32:28] baptizo into the vinegar solution now
[32:31] we're all from the south and we know
[32:33] that's how it happens but remember
[32:35] there's something happens because a
[32:37] pickle was a cucumber at one time am but
[32:41] when it becomes a pickle it don't go
[32:44] back to being a cucumber anymore I hope
[32:47] somebody got something
[32:51] there it changes you both verbs concern
[32:55] the immersing of vegetables in a
[32:57] solution but the first is temporary the
[33:00] second the act of baptizing the
[33:02] vegetable produces a permanent change
[33:05] when used in the New Testament this word
[33:07] more often refers to our Union and
[33:09] identification with Christ than to our
[33:11] water baptism Mark 16:16 he that
[33:13] believes and is baptized shall be saved
[33:15] Christ is saying that mere intellectual
[33:17] asent is not enough there must be a
[33:20] union with him a real change like the
[33:23] vegetable to the pickle and as I said
[33:26] before when we baptize
[33:28] we are absolutely expecting God to kill
[33:32] something yes sir
[33:35] death
[33:37] burial Resurrection all right in other
[33:41] words if it's not then we're just you're
[33:43] just going to be dry and you're going to
[33:45] be wet and you're going to come up out
[33:46] of the water no we expect a change cuz
[33:50] cuz listen cuz that's what God told us
[33:51] to do that's right all right God told us
[33:54] the last thing he told us before he left
[33:56] he said go preach and baptize all right
[33:59] and do this in the name of the father
[34:03] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all
[34:05] right so everybody's with me all right
[34:07] so let's look here in Matthew
[34:09] 3:4 to the same John why they call John
[34:12] the Baptist because he baptized people
[34:14] hello and the same John had his rment of
[34:17] camel's hair and a leather girdle about
[34:19] his loins and his meat was Locust and
[34:21] Wild Honey water died then went out then
[34:25] went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea
[34:29] and all the regions around Jordan and
[34:30] were baptized of him in Jordan
[34:33] confessing their sins all right so you
[34:35] see this water baptism begins with John
[34:38] immersing in water a group of people all
[34:42] right is everybody with me now let's
[34:44] look at this and see how important water
[34:46] baptism is cuz he had one person come to
[34:48] him that was really very very
[34:50] important all right Matthew 3:1 13 says
[34:53] then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan
[34:56] unto John to be baptized of him but John
[35:01] forbade him saying I have need to be
[35:03] baptized of thee and comest thou to me
[35:07] and Jesus answered and said suffer it to
[35:08] be so now for thus it becometh us to
[35:11] fulfill all righteousness then he
[35:13] suffered him now in other words in other
[35:15] words he baptized him all right now what
[35:17] Jesus was saying was and if you go back
[35:19] into the Old Testament and remember that
[35:22] in the Old Testament when the sacrifice
[35:24] was getting ready to be put on the Altar
[35:27] and to be SL Lane everybody with me you
[35:30] had to wash it so the sacrifice had to
[35:33] be washed something it had to be washed
[35:35] before it was presented to the priest so
[35:37] that's what Jesus is saying I know I'm
[35:39] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[35:41] of the world cuz you said I was and now
[35:43] the lamb must be washed and he let John
[35:46] baptize him but now something happened
[35:49] during that baptism on and Jesus when he
[35:53] was baptized went up straight way out of
[35:55] the water that's what I mean he come
[35:56] straight way out of the water he wasn't
[35:57] sprinkled amen and lo the heavens were
[36:00] opened unto him and he saw the spirit of
[36:02] God descending like a dove and lighting
[36:03] upon him and lo a voice from Heaven
[36:05] saying this is my beloved Son and whom I
[36:08] am well pleased God was pleased with the
[36:10] baptismal service we're going to be
[36:12] pleased today God's going to be pleased
[36:14] with the baptismal service today amen so
[36:18] now let's look at
[36:19] this now Jesus told us said go ye
[36:23] therefore now this is God himself this
[36:24] is Jesus all right this is go ye
[36:27] therefore somebody we're supposed to
[36:28] listen to go ye therefore go teach
[36:33] preach baptize in the name now look that
[36:36] it didn't say
[36:38] names cuz I want to ask you a question
[36:40] before we get
[36:41] started if you are a
[36:44] father in this building today raise your
[36:47] hand if you're a
[36:50] father all right put him
[36:53] down
[36:56] son
[37:00] Spirit okay I want you father come up
[37:02] here you one father come up
[37:04] here well which one you going to
[37:08] choose but if I say Aaron
[37:10] Roberts that's a name amen if I say
[37:14] Aaron Roberts everybody in this building
[37:15] that knows him would know that I'm
[37:18] talking about this guy there's a name
[37:20] and then there's something behind that
[37:22] name amen but his name's not father
[37:26] right right it's a title to a name he is
[37:29] a son but he has a
[37:33] name and it's connected and the always
[37:35] be connected he'll never sign a check
[37:37] that says
[37:40] father you'll get it back
[37:43] right we don't we don't write checks
[37:45] anymore so what does it matter y'all are
[37:47] putting me out of business I work for
[37:48] the post office please do something send
[37:50] something through the mail it may take
[37:51] six or eight weeks but please send
[37:53] something
[37:56] hey not my fault we can't hire people to
[37:59] do their
[38:00] job but Jesus gave us a job and we're
[38:03] we're trying to do a job right here okay
[38:06] so go ye therefore and teach All Nations
[38:08] baptizing them in the name yes sir it's
[38:12] father a
[38:13] name no it's not a name no it's Holy
[38:18] Ghost a
[38:20] name now look the name is used for
[38:23] everything which the name
[38:25] covers right
[38:28] everything the thought or feeling of
[38:30] which is aroused in the Mind by
[38:32] mentioning hearing and remembering the
[38:34] name when I say all right I want to talk
[38:36] to Aaron Roberts now everybody that
[38:38] knows him in here knows that he is my
[38:40] brother
[38:42] brother-in-law cuz his brother married
[38:44] my my
[38:45] sister I know that he works for tacky a
[38:49] tacky place he he yeah he knows how to
[38:53] do hbac his wife is Sarah
[38:58] his two kids are Levi and Adam right
[39:02] most of you that know him know
[39:05] that but we know he's a father too cuz
[39:08] he has children we know he's a son cuz
[39:11] we knew his dad and we know his
[39:14] mom and he's a spirit man cuz he's
[39:16] standing there shaking sitting there
[39:18] shaking his head right but that's not
[39:20] his
[39:22] name his name identifies and and what
[39:25] does it do it divides who he
[39:29] is all right so now remember Jesus said
[39:32] in the name of the father and of the son
[39:35] and of the Holy
[39:39] Ghost
[39:40] so everything which is aroused in the
[39:43] mind in other words the thinking of who
[39:44] he is by mentioning hearing remembering
[39:47] the name for one's rank
[39:49] Authority interest pleasure command
[39:52] Excellence Deeds Etc so when you call
[39:54] somebody's name there's something behind
[39:57] all that all right when you say father
[40:00] that could mean the 25 or 30 people in
[40:02] here that shook raise their hand said
[40:04] they're a father right but there's got
[40:07] to be a name behind it all
[40:10] right your name doesn't just do the job
[40:13] of signaling things about you to other
[40:16] people your name can also be a vital
[40:19] expression of your own individual
[40:23] identity just like I presented right
[40:25] here I don't work for tacky I work for
[40:27] the Post Office my name's way Dale his
[40:30] name's Aaron Roberts we each have a a
[40:32] significance behind the
[40:35] name and there's power behind the
[40:39] name if you say the well let's don't use
[40:42] the president of the United States let's
[40:43] use something
[40:46] else if you say the governor of the
[40:48] state of
[40:50] Georgia well now if you say the current
[40:53] governor you might say it would be
[40:55] whatever his name is cuts his hair but
[40:59] huh that's what I said Brian km but if
[41:03] you say the governor of the state of
[41:05] Georgia and just leave it out there are
[41:07] you talking about him you talking about
[41:08] Joe Frank Harris you talking about all
[41:10] the different ones Jimmy Carter but you
[41:12] you put the you say no I'm talking about
[41:14] Brian km so that's where you present
[41:18] that you say I'm talking about this
[41:19] person right here all right so your name
[41:22] can also be a vital expression of your
[41:23] own individual identity representing a
[41:26] profound con connection to your family
[41:30] now we're going to read scripture that's
[41:31] going to connect to every bit of this
[41:33] everybody with me I'm not just reading
[41:35] this cuz I found it online it must be
[41:37] true Steve because it's off the
[41:39] internet
[41:41] so and I don't do Tik Tock or another
[41:43] that so I worry about representing a
[41:45] profound connection to your family
[41:47] language and Community what is the power
[41:50] behind the name not only can a name
[41:53] connect each of us to our own identity
[41:55] and individuality but it can also carry
[41:58] power Brian
[42:02] km
[42:04] responsibility and blessings right what
[42:08] does the Bible say about the power of
[42:09] names names carried weight and character
[42:12] and were often tied to a person's
[42:15] Destiny now it shows that God changed
[42:18] Abram's name to Abraham because Abram
[42:21] did not mean father of many nations
[42:23] Abraham means father of many nations and
[42:25] God told him he would be the father of
[42:27] Nations is everybody with me Bible
[42:29] readers you know this all right
[42:31] Saul became Paul Saul persecuted the
[42:35] Christians Paul became a
[42:38] Christian so we know that because his
[42:40] name was Saul over here in the Bible
[42:42] right and he persecuted the Christians
[42:44] but now his name is
[42:46] Paul
[42:49] Peter there was a name
[42:52] change when there was something changed
[42:54] in their life amen and listen when we
[42:57] get born again our name is changed to
[43:01] Mrs Jesus Christ we are not born of this
[43:04] world anymore we are born from above you
[43:07] born down here you're going to
[43:10] die that's right but you born from above
[43:13] you'll live you say oh why is the grav
[43:15] full oh don't worry that's just
[43:19] temporary names carried weight and
[43:21] character were off were often tied to a
[43:23] person's Destiny that's why throughout
[43:26] scripture when God was was about to do
[43:27] something new with a person new with a
[43:30] person he would often change the name
[43:32] names carried weight and character and
[43:34] were often tied to a person's Destiny
[43:37] Abram became Abraham let's look in the
[43:41] Bible what the Bible says about a name
[43:44] now here's John 5:43 now this is Jesus
[43:47] talking all right he says I am come in
[43:50] my
[43:51] father's
[43:53] name he didn't say I am coming my father
[43:57] corre he said I'm coming in my father's
[44:01] name and God's not a
[44:04] name that's
[44:07] right amen God's an object of worship
[44:12] it's a
[44:14] title God had a name it was Jesus
[44:18] Christ I am come in my father's name and
[44:22] you receive me not if another shall come
[44:25] in his own name him you will
[44:28] receive right oh so there must be
[44:30] something behind the
[44:31] name the name Jesus Christ got him
[44:34] killed that's right amen Ephesians
[44:39] 3:14 Paul says for this cause I bow my
[44:41] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[44:45] Christ of whom the whole family in
[44:48] Heaven and Earth is what
[44:54] named we're all now
[44:58] pickles we were born cucumbers now we're
[45:02] pickles cuz we had a change
[45:05] yes 2 Corinthians 11:1 says would to God
[45:10] you could bear with me a little in my
[45:11] Folly and indeed bear with me this is
[45:13] Paul for I am jealous over you with
[45:16] Godly jealousy for I have espoused you
[45:18] to one husband that I may present you as
[45:22] a chased virgin to Christ amen points
[45:26] you where is going to take you to right
[45:28] amen Zechariah 14:9 says and the Lord
[45:31] shall be king over all the Earth in that
[45:33] day shall there be one Lord and his name
[45:37] one now listen God's name is not o NE
[45:41] e he has a name he has one name that's
[45:46] why Jesus didn't say in the names Jesus
[45:48] stood said baptized in the name of the
[45:50] father and of the son and of the Holy
[45:52] Ghost all right because there's only one
[45:55] name we're going to read it here in just
[45:56] a minute whereby men are saved and
[45:59] that's Jesus Christ acts 4:1 says be it
[46:02] unto you all be it known unto you all
[46:04] and to all the people of Israel that by
[46:07] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[46:10] whom you crucified whom God raised from
[46:13] the dead even by him do this man stand
[46:15] here before you whole this is the stone
[46:18] which was said at not of you Builder
[46:20] this is this is Peter and joh and James
[46:22] talking which has become the head of the
[46:24] corner neither is there salvation and
[46:27] any other right for there is none
[46:31] other name amen under Heaven given unto
[46:36] men whereby we must be
[46:38] saved not titles
[46:41] name Ephesians 4:4 there's one body one
[46:46] Spirit even as you are called in one
[46:48] hope of your calling yes one Lord One
[46:51] Faith one baptism all right so there's
[46:54] not two or three baptisms one God and
[46:57] Father of all who is above all and
[47:00] through all and in you all thank God
[47:02] Paul was a
[47:03] southerner in you all Colossians 3:16
[47:08] Says let the word of the C listen this
[47:10] is Bible yes all right this is Bible am
[47:13] everybody with me all right let the word
[47:15] of Christ dwell in you richly in all
[47:18] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[47:20] another in Psalms and hymns and
[47:22] spiritual songs we were just doing that
[47:25] singing with Grace in heart to the Lord
[47:28] and whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[47:32] all in the titles of father
[47:34] [Music]
[47:35] son oh I know what that says watch
[47:39] whatever you doing word or deed do all
[47:42] everybody say all y'all didn't all say
[47:44] all say all say all like George a touch
[47:47] just SC a
[47:49] touchdown that's better
[47:52] do do all in the name of of the Lord
[47:57] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[47:59] father by him everybody with me all
[48:02] right look at the importance of a name
[48:04] Philippians 2:8 and being found in
[48:07] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[48:09] became obedient unto death even the
[48:12] death of the Cross wherefore God also ha
[48:15] highly exalted him and given who's this
[48:18] himy who's this him
[48:21] guy this him guy's got a name sir or you
[48:25] could call him Judas but right here he
[48:27] connects it look giving him a name which
[48:30] is above every name that at the name of
[48:33] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[48:35] heaven and things in Earth and things
[48:37] under the Earth and that every tongue
[48:39] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[48:42] to the glory of God the Father I'm
[48:45] trying to hold it down
[48:47] here who has the keys now let's say I'm
[48:50] ask you a question God Jesus gave the
[48:56] key to somebody that was on
[48:58] Earth all right Matthew 16:18 I've got
[49:02] them here if you want to read them and
[49:04] they'll be on line if you need to see
[49:06] them again but if you're a Bible reader
[49:08] you know this is all Bible and I say
[49:11] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[49:15] This Rock I will build my church now
[49:17] this is Peter right amen and the Gates
[49:19] of Hell shall not Prevail against it
[49:22] look at verse 19 and I who's talking
[49:26] Jesus
[49:27] right will give unto thee Peter the Keys
[49:32] of the Kingdom of
[49:34] Heaven if you got the key to something
[49:37] that means you can get
[49:38] in or that means you can lock somebody
[49:42] out and I will give unto thee the Keys
[49:44] of the Kingdom and whatsoever Thou shalt
[49:48] bind on Earth what power whatsoever Thou
[49:53] shalt bind on
[49:55] Earth he said I'm going to honor that
[49:57] and I'm going to bind it in heaven amen
[50:00] but now whatever you loose on Earth
[50:02] whatever you speak whatever you loose in
[50:04] the name of the Lord
[50:06] Jesus I'm going to loose it in heaven
[50:09] amen Peter's a pretty important guy amen
[50:13] so let's look now we come to Matthew
[50:16] 28:19 which Jesus said going to all the
[50:18] world teaching and preaching and
[50:20] baptizing in the name of the father and
[50:21] of the son and of the Holy Ghost now
[50:23] acts two is
[50:25] about 11 or 12 days after Jesus said
[50:29] that and
[50:31] ascended all right and he's give the
[50:35] power and authority to a man named Peter
[50:37] with a set of keys not physically but
[50:40] whatever he said he said whatever you
[50:43] say now here's Acts 2:36 therefore let
[50:46] all the house of Israel know ass surely
[50:48] that God hath made this same Jesus whom
[50:50] you've crucified both Lord and
[50:53] Christ H got it Lord and Christ Christ H
[50:59] now when they heard this they were
[51:01] pricked in their heart they heard a
[51:03] simple message they were pricked in
[51:06] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[51:08] the rest of the Apostles men and
[51:10] Brethren what shall we
[51:11] do then Peter now here's Peter now
[51:15] listen what's Peter got Peter's got keys
[51:19] that the Lord Jesus himself gave to him
[51:22] that's right not another man
[51:25] right then P said unto them
[51:29] repent right and be baptized every one
[51:32] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[51:36] the remission of sins and you shall
[51:38] receive look at that promise and you
[51:40] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[51:44] Ghost for the promis is unto you and to
[51:47] your children and to all that are far
[51:49] off right here we're far
[51:52] off even as many as our Lord Our God
[51:55] shall call and with many other words did
[51:58] he testify and exhort saying save
[51:59] yourself from this untour generation the
[52:03] first step of getting out of this
[52:05] generation is to
[52:07] repent and then be baptized in a name
[52:11] that's right right that's what Peter
[52:14] said Jesus even said that that's
[52:17] right then they that gladly received his
[52:19] word were what baptized they didn't have
[52:21] a problem with it they were baptized
[52:24] 3,000 we're going to do four today could
[52:26] you imagine 3,000 it said the same
[52:33] day they were added under them 3,000
[52:36] Souls that believed one man's
[52:40] preaching and didn't say now hang on a
[52:42] minute I heard that man 12 days ago say
[52:45] to baptize different
[52:48] no he told you bapt he told you baptize
[52:52] same way Peter said because they can't
[52:54] be contradictory to each other that's
[52:56] right they continued steadfast in the
[52:58] apostles Doctrine in fellowship and in
[53:00] Breaking of bread and in prayer all
[53:03] right now right here and we won't be
[53:04] long today we'll get ready to get
[53:06] baptized now if you go to this website
[53:09] it's called Apostolic archives
[53:11] International Incorporated it's on the
[53:14] Internet it's got to be
[53:16] true this is true because it it put you
[53:19] right into the scripture so now look
[53:22] baptism in the name of the Lord
[53:25] Jesus now
[53:27] many millions of of
[53:31] converts have been baptized in the name
[53:33] of the father and of the son and of the
[53:34] Holy Ghost all
[53:35] right right and you're going to hear me
[53:37] say we're going to baptize today in the
[53:39] name of the father and of the son and of
[53:40] the Holy Ghost to fulfill that scripture
[53:43] we're going to baptize you in the name
[53:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's
[53:46] exactly what it says they're not two
[53:47] different scriptures or you just might
[53:48] as well tear your Bible up and throw it
[53:51] away hello somebody I mean if God can't
[53:54] keep it straight you know me and you
[53:56] can't that's
[53:59] right so how did the early church now
[54:02] this is the early church interpret
[54:04] Christ's command in Matthew
[54:07] 28:19 we're talking about acts 238 acts
[54:10] 8:16 acts 10:48 and acts 19:5 are four
[54:15] biblical references that answer this
[54:17] question I when I was at the Philippine
[54:19] in the Philippines they have a mystery
[54:21] Expo and hundreds of denominational
[54:24] preachers and they're all trinitarians
[54:26] and they're all they all baptized name
[54:27] Father Son and Holy Ghost and they're
[54:29] all sitting in there you know about it
[54:30] was at that day was about 50 something
[54:32] 58 of them I think it
[54:34] was and brother roel God bless his heart
[54:37] when I call his name it just hurts cuz
[54:39] he's passed on you know but he stood up
[54:41] and he said
[54:42] okay he said I got a
[54:46] $10,000 for one of you to bring me a
[54:49] scripture that anybody in the Bible was
[54:51] baptized in titles of Father Son and
[54:54] Holy Ghost right one scripture
[54:57] I'll give you $10,000 I don't know where
[54:59] he got that $10,000 from but I'm so
[55:02] confident i' give you a
[55:04] million I may have to work the rest of
[55:06] my life B from Brother
[55:11] Kylie oh I need to worry okay he says I
[55:13] need to
[55:15] worry but there's nobody there's nobody
[55:18] in scripture ever baptized in those
[55:21] titles that's right not
[55:25] one now let's let's look at the history
[55:27] and this is true history because it's it
[55:28] comes from these encyclopedias that's
[55:30] why I made the encyclopedias a little
[55:34] um highlighted
[55:36] them if the biblical record is not
[55:38] enough please examine the findings of
[55:40] the educated Scholars and historians
[55:42] this is branica encyclopedia 11th
[55:44] Edition volume 3 page 365 baptism was
[55:51] changed from the name of Jesus to words
[55:54] father Son and Holy Ghost in the second
[55:55] century
[55:58] amen you have you have boy and Janice
[56:01] said they have the bratanic encyclopedia
[56:02] that has that in it if you want to read
[56:04] it cany Encyclopedia of religion page 53
[56:07] said the early church baptized in the
[56:09] name of the Lord Jesus until the second
[56:12] century am Hastings Encyclopedia of
[56:15] religion volume two Christian baptism
[56:17] was administered using the words in the
[56:19] name of Jesus page 377 baptism was
[56:22] always in the name of Jesus until the
[56:24] time of Justin Martyr page
[56:27] 389 Catholic
[56:29] encyclopedia oh boy don't read too much
[56:32] into
[56:33] that but you can read this volume two
[56:36] page 263 here the author acknowledges
[56:38] that the baptismal formula was changed
[56:41] by their church
[56:44] right you're baptizing in a Catholic
[56:49] doctrin sha for herzog's religious
[56:51] encyclopedia volume one page 435 the New
[56:54] Testament knows only
[56:57] the baptism in the name of Jesus
[57:00] Hastings dictionary of the Bible page 88
[57:02] it must be acknowledged that the
[57:03] threefold name of Matthew 28:19 does not
[57:07] appear to have been used by the
[57:08] Primitive church but rather in the name
[57:11] of Jesus Jesus Christ Our Lord
[57:15] Jesus is it an absolute necessity that
[57:17] the name of Jesus be spoken or called
[57:19] over a candidate for what of baptism
[57:20] when he's being baptized for the answer
[57:22] to this question please read Acts 15:17
[57:26] and James 2:7 first century Christians
[57:29] invoked or called The Name of Jesus over
[57:31] Believers in water baptism if as some
[57:34] Say the Name of Jesus means the
[57:35] authority of Jesus then so much more
[57:37] should the name rather than the titles
[57:41] be called over an individual in baptism
[57:43] read Matthew 28:18 Acts 4:12 Colossians
[57:46] 2:9 Jude 3 is an exhortation to contend
[57:49] for the faith once delivered to the
[57:52] Saints see Galatians 1 89 I kind of
[57:56] didn't go to that to save time cuz I
[57:58] don't want to we're going to have a
[58:00] baptismal service all right now look
[58:02] baptism in Jesus name according to the
[58:05] Bible Jesus taught that repentance and
[58:07] remission of sins should be preached in
[58:09] his name beginning at Jerusalem Luke
[58:13] 24:47 Peter obeyed and said repent and
[58:16] be baptized every one of you in the name
[58:17] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[58:19] sins acts
[58:20] 23839 the Samaritans they were baptized
[58:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus acts 8:16
[58:27] the Gentiles were commanded he commanded
[58:29] them to be baptized in the name of the
[58:30] Lord Jesus acts 10 verse 48 Paul
[58:34] re-baptized a group of
[58:36] people that were baptized unto John all
[58:40] right when they heard this they were
[58:41] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:43] Acts 19 3:5 no other name for salvation
[58:48] there is none other name under heaven
[58:50] whereby we must be saved acts 4
[58:53] 10-12 everything done in Jesus name
[58:56] whatsoever you do in word or inde deed
[58:58] do
[59:00] all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:04] Galatians 3: Colossians 3:1 17 the above
[59:07] scriptures are not given to refute
[59:08] Matthew 28:19 where Jesus told the
[59:10] apostles to baptize in the name of the
[59:12] father and of the son and of the Holy
[59:14] Ghost they merely show how the command
[59:16] was interpreted and obeyed by them the
[59:19] apostles knew what most religious
[59:22] leaders of today fail to recognize first
[59:24] that the Lord Jesus Christ is the family
[59:26] name
[59:27] [Music]
[59:28] Hallelujah that's where I I'm not
[59:30] identified as a Dale anymore come on I'm
[59:33] a Christian yes you're a Christian if
[59:37] you're born again you're a Christian
[59:39] that puts you in
[59:40] heaven the name Dale may be a good name
[59:43] but if you're not born again it'll put
[59:44] you in
[59:48] hell the apostles knew what most
[59:50] religious leaders of today fail to
[59:52] recognize first that the Lord Jesus
[59:54] Christ is a family name Ephesians 3:15
[59:57] second that the fullness of the godhead
[59:58] deity or God dwelleth bodily in who
[1:00:02] Christ they knew the name of the son was
[1:00:05] Jesus Matthew 1: 21 they knew that the
[1:00:08] son came in the father's name John 5:43
[1:00:10] I read that to you they also knew that
[1:00:12] the Holy Ghost was the spirit of Christ
[1:00:14] and would come in Jesus name John
[1:00:17] 14:26 the name Jesus means Jehovah
[1:00:20] salvation that's in faucets Bible
[1:00:22] encyclopedia page 359 now I couldn't
[1:00:25] condemn these so I'm just going to have
[1:00:27] to read I couldn't get them in a box I'm
[1:00:30] sorry I'm kind of illiterate when it
[1:00:32] comes to this stuff but the baptismal
[1:00:34] formula was changed from the name of
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ by the Catholic church in
[1:00:39] the 2 Century I read that everywhere in
[1:00:42] the oldest sources it states that
[1:00:44] baptism took place in Jesus name all
[1:00:46] right Catholic ENC encyclopedia says
[1:00:48] here the Catholics acknowledge that they
[1:00:51] changed the
[1:00:52] baptism they changed it right
[1:00:59] let's go on down to right
[1:01:01] here
[1:01:04] look which of these were practiced by
[1:01:06] the apostles in the early
[1:01:09] church below are two columns you see
[1:01:12] those two columns one's full and one's
[1:01:16] empty below are two columns for listing
[1:01:18] the scriptures where the apostles either
[1:01:20] taught or practiced water
[1:01:22] baptism in Jesus name I read them to you
[1:01:25] a minute ago go repent and be baptized
[1:01:27] in the name of Jesus Christ they were
[1:01:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:30] he commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:01:31] name of the Lord Jesus there's none
[1:01:33] other name given whereby we must be
[1:01:35] saved Paul taught whatever you do do all
[1:01:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus now show
[1:01:39] me a scripture over there on that
[1:01:42] side not
[1:01:46] one my million dollars is
[1:01:50] safe yes that my wife
[1:01:54] said
[1:01:57] Matthew 28:19 was a command by Jesus to
[1:02:01] baptize in a name all right the apostles
[1:02:04] did not repeat the words of the command
[1:02:06] but they did obey it as seen in the
[1:02:09] scriptures above since Father Son and
[1:02:11] Holy Ghost are titles of the
[1:02:13] manifestation of the almighty spirit and
[1:02:16] his body the apostles understood his
[1:02:18] saving name to be Jesus
[1:02:21] amen can any dare say that the apostles
[1:02:24] disobeyed the Lord are Faith to baptize
[1:02:26] properly the name of the father Son and
[1:02:29] Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:02:33] actions of the Apostles in the book of
[1:02:35] Acts prove this to be
[1:02:37] true we'll finish with this and then
[1:02:39] we'll say a few words and then we'll be
[1:02:42] done Romans 8 Romans 6:3 we we're going
[1:02:44] to read that outside know you not that
[1:02:47] so many of us were baptized what into
[1:02:50] Jesus Christ one more time Jesus Christ
[1:02:53] we're baptized into his death that's
[1:02:55] what identif ifies us a father doesn't
[1:02:58] identify me my name identifies who I am
[1:03:02] amen know you not that so many of us
[1:03:04] were baptized into Jesus Christ we're
[1:03:07] baptized into his death therefore we are
[1:03:09] buried with him by bapti baptism into
[1:03:13] death that like as Christ was raised up
[1:03:16] from the dead when we go down and come
[1:03:17] back
[1:03:18] up that like as Christ was raised up
[1:03:21] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:03:22] even so also we should walk in newness
[1:03:25] of
[1:03:28] life Colossians
[1:03:31] 2:1 in whom also you were circumcised
[1:03:33] with a circumcision made without hands
[1:03:35] remember the circumcision in the Bible
[1:03:37] in the Old Testament was a type of the
[1:03:39] of the Holy Ghost all right so we don't
[1:03:42] do that anymore it's not a type you get
[1:03:43] born
[1:03:44] again all right and whom also you are
[1:03:47] circumcised with a circumcision made
[1:03:49] without hands and putting off of the
[1:03:50] body of sins of the flesh by the
[1:03:52] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[1:03:55] in baptism
[1:03:59] now if you bury now I'm going to depend
[1:04:01] if I pass away I'm going to depend on
[1:04:05] somebody to bring me out of the
[1:04:09] Grave cuz this life is just about that
[1:04:11] short but there's an eternal one going
[1:04:14] in that direction everybody with me all
[1:04:16] right I'm going to depend on that and I
[1:04:19] am not going to
[1:04:22] depend on my father to raise me up
[1:04:27] who you talking about are you talking
[1:04:28] about Samuel Dale he'll be here in a
[1:04:30] little
[1:04:31] while you'll get to see
[1:04:37] him am I going to be depending on a
[1:04:41] son what
[1:04:43] son to raise me from the
[1:04:48] dead am am I going to depend on the
[1:04:52] spirit no I'm going to depend on the guy
[1:04:55] that put put me there with a hope to get
[1:04:58] back out and his name's the Lord Jesus
[1:05:06] Christ buried with him in baptism
[1:05:08] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:05:11] through the now who's him like I say
[1:05:13] again what we talking about who's
[1:05:15] him brother Dell preached to us a long
[1:05:17] time ago he said what if you took every
[1:05:19] name out of the Bible how in the world
[1:05:21] could you understand it
[1:05:24] right
[1:05:27] read it look in the Bible and just start
[1:05:29] reading even in
[1:05:33] Genesis was formed from the dust of the
[1:05:35] ground and Adam come
[1:05:38] and what I was saying I said
[1:05:41] Adam and Eve but that just those that
[1:05:44] first little two verses you're going
[1:05:45] who's he talking about but when I say
[1:05:48] Adam everybody knows who Adam was when I
[1:05:50] say Eve everybody knows who Eve was when
[1:05:53] I say I'm going to be baptized in the
[1:05:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know who
[1:05:58] that person
[1:06:01] is buried with him in baptism wherein
[1:06:04] also you are risen with him through the
[1:06:05] faith of the operation of God who hath
[1:06:08] raised him from the dead and you being
[1:06:10] dead in your sins you can be just as
[1:06:13] alive and goodlooking as I still can't
[1:06:16] remember his name as Al and goodlooking
[1:06:19] as he is but if you're not born again
[1:06:21] you're
[1:06:22] dead right but you're alive in Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ
[1:06:26] not in a title that'sall title can be
[1:06:29] many things but when you hone it down to
[1:06:32] a man named Lord Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ you know where you come
[1:06:40] from and you know where you
[1:06:42] going CU all the family in Heaven and
[1:06:47] Earth is name Jesus Christ not a
[1:06:52] title and you being dead in your sins
[1:06:54] and the uncircum ision of your fles hath
[1:06:57] he quickened together with him having
[1:06:59] forgiven you all trespasses somebody say
[1:07:02] all all transgressions or trespasses all
[1:07:06] of them but you got to do it by
[1:07:10] name that's right listen why does the
[1:07:12] why does the world say the word Jesus
[1:07:15] name Jesus Christ and it ain't
[1:07:19] good that's the devil telling them to do
[1:07:21] it that's blaspheming the name of God
[1:07:24] yes yes you've heard them say it they
[1:07:27] say it all the
[1:07:28] time that's
[1:07:30] horrible it's the most precious name
[1:07:32] ever come off anybody's
[1:07:34] lip and for them to to desecrate it they
[1:07:37] deserve
[1:07:38] hell hello there is a hell that's right
[1:07:42] and you go in there if you're not
[1:07:43] baptized not baptized this baptized but
[1:07:45] baptized by the holy spirit in your soul
[1:07:48] yes but you need to be
[1:07:51] baptized to identify who you are amen
[1:07:55] amen right to identify who you
[1:07:58] are it is an outward expression I didn't
[1:08:01] read the Bible but it talks about an
[1:08:02] outward expression of an inward
[1:08:06] work that these four are going to show
[1:08:10] not only just the community that's
[1:08:13] right but it'll be on the internet so
[1:08:15] it'll be all over the world that they
[1:08:17] took a stand

[1:08:24] stand

[1:09:10] down that's it and I saw a change right
[1:09:19] Hallelujah they drove it down and said I
[1:09:23] declare this is it that's right amen I
[1:09:26] declare this is
[1:09:30] it we've had people be baptized several
[1:09:33] several times and that's okay I'll
[1:09:34] baptize you as many times you want to be
[1:09:36] baptized but that's a certain time when
[1:09:38] you got to quit going to the water every
[1:09:43] Sunday but I
[1:09:45] will cuz the water's
[1:09:49] warm but put that state down yes that's
[1:09:53] it Satan right here
[1:09:55] this is where I change
[1:09:59] families this is where I change family
[1:10:02] I'm not a cucumber anymore I'm a
[1:10:07] pickle but you'll get me out of a
[1:10:12] pickle all right I said I was going to
[1:10:13] calm down we got
[1:10:17] bsiness but I believe that God told us
[1:10:20] one way to be baptized amen amen the the
[1:10:24] the apostles weren't confused used Jesus
[1:10:26] obviously wasn't
[1:10:28] confused but he told us to do it in the
[1:10:32] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:10:35] the Holy
[1:10:37] Ghost the
[1:10:39] name there's
[1:10:43] power we sing a song there's
[1:10:47] power in the name of
[1:10:49] Jesus there's power what because there's
[1:10:52] something behind the name there's a life
[1:10:55] behind the name that's right and your
[1:10:58] life you know what makes the demons
[1:11:01] tremble you know what makes Satan
[1:11:02] tremble not not not not reading the
[1:11:04] Bible every
[1:11:07] day it's living that Bible every
[1:11:11] day Satan can read he can read better
[1:11:13] than you he he got a church for you
[1:11:17] did he can read it he's been listen he's
[1:11:20] been reading that thing since they put
[1:11:22] it in
[1:11:22] print the devil ain't an idiot well okay
[1:11:26] he
[1:11:27] is but he keeps reading the thing over
[1:11:30] and over
[1:11:32] again sees his own demise and don't
[1:11:35] believe it that's how bad an unbeliever
[1:11:37] he
[1:11:39] is but I see he has an
[1:11:43] end cuz my
[1:11:46] daddy my daddy
[1:11:49] said he'll have an end there'll be a
[1:11:52] lake of fire yeah and listen he won't be
[1:11:55] be alone that's right right he will not
[1:11:58] be
[1:12:00] alone I like what uh brother Brady over
[1:12:04] in Jamaica you most of us know who he is
[1:12:07] he's very
[1:12:09] Frank he was doing a funeral one time
[1:12:11] and he said and you know how he does
[1:12:13] like this he said I tell
[1:12:16] you Way he talk I tell you if old John
[1:12:21] here didn't repent he's in hell right
[1:12:24] now
[1:12:32] somebody called me the other day and
[1:12:33] asked me about what should they say at a
[1:12:35] funeral I said daddy always told me that
[1:12:38] people don't get up and leave funerals
[1:12:40] until it's over that's right so you got
[1:12:44] them preach to them preach salvation
[1:12:47] preach the name of the Lord Jesus to him
[1:12:49] cuz most of the time they ain't going to
[1:12:50] get up walk
[1:12:52] out now they probably got mad at brother
[1:12:54] Brady family did but he's telling the
[1:12:57] truth abely that's right Paul says have
[1:12:59] I made and become your
[1:13:01] enemy have I made him become your enemy
[1:13:04] because I told you what the Bible said
[1:13:06] nothing not another man
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:13] right the Bible if we can't believe the
[1:13:17] Bible let's just eat and drink and be
[1:13:19] married cuz we're going to all die and
[1:13:21] we just going to vaporize into nothing
[1:13:26] right but if I have only hope the Bible
[1:13:28] says in this
[1:13:30] life I'm a men most
[1:13:33] miserable I wouldn't live another day
[1:13:36] without God in my
[1:13:37] heart now I did for 20 years I
[1:13:42] did but that didn't mean God didn't call
[1:13:45] me but he called me for the last time
[1:13:48] one day brother Gary I responded you got
[1:13:52] to respond remember you don't go looking
[1:13:53] for God that's
[1:13:56] right right sister Rebecca you don't God
[1:13:58] comes looking for you and he
[1:14:01] comes knocking on your
[1:14:06] door you love the Lord
[1:14:09] am I do too cuz he gave us a purpose and
[1:14:12] a plan to be here told us what to do we
[1:14:15] just got to do
[1:14:16] it we just got to do it and and you know
[1:14:20] we can drown oursel in this and that and
[1:14:22] the other and all this other stuff what
[1:14:24] is it
[1:14:26] temporary what I'm telling you today is
[1:14:32] eternal Eternal see we as human beings
[1:14:36] we can't understand Eternal cuz you're
[1:14:38] all looking at your watch now going I
[1:14:39] wish you
[1:14:44] quit but there's one day where there's
[1:14:46] not going to be
[1:14:48] time there one day when we can sit
[1:14:52] down by a river with with the most clean
[1:14:55] water you ever seen in your
[1:14:57] life not a cloud in the
[1:15:01] sky Steve you won't be grunting when you
[1:15:03] get up out of a chair I do I don't know
[1:15:05] about you
[1:15:07] but none of my bones will be
[1:15:09] hurting my teeth will be right where
[1:15:11] they're supposed to
[1:15:14] be but that's not true
[1:15:17] here so you better make your preparation
[1:15:20] here for
[1:15:22] there you got to make it here the Bible
[1:15:25] says whatever way the tree falls or
[1:15:27] leans that's the way it's going to
[1:15:29] fall don't depend on dying and then
[1:15:33] getting right somewhere else you need to
[1:15:35] get right right here so Peter stands up
[1:15:38] on the dead of Pentecost and he says
[1:15:39] what repent
[1:15:42] yes I pray all four of you have repented
[1:15:46] for your sin and then you want to go to
[1:15:49] water
[1:15:51] baptism right
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:55] right repent because when you repent you
[1:15:58] can put a steak down you say that's
[1:16:04] it praise God God's got
[1:16:07] amnesia he can't remember my sins if I
[1:16:09] confess them to
[1:16:12] him what a mighty God we
[1:16:15] serve yeah but you and I don't can't
[1:16:17] forget it well no we
[1:16:19] can't but like I said
[1:16:21] before tragedy does not destroy a
[1:16:25] Christian it defines who they
[1:16:28] are look at Job look at
[1:16:31] Jesus look at all the people went
[1:16:33] through tragedy we talking about this

[1:16:50] picnic am man it's a
[1:16:53] battle and the first battle is is that
[1:16:55] when you step out and say God I want to
