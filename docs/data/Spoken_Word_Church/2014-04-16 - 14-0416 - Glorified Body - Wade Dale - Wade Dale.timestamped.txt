[10:20] your prayers there and let the Lord be
[10:23] with us I hate it I miss brother Ernie
[10:25] but
[10:26] we had this scheduled sometime before so
[10:29] Philippians 3
[10:32] we're going to talk tonight on something
[10:34] since
[10:35] we've got a lot of new ones
[10:38] uh coming in and I was hoping maybe
[10:41] brother Paul would be here the
[10:43] the other brother but
[10:45] for uh
[10:48] if most of you didn't realize that we
[10:51] got a couple more family members this
[10:52] weekend
[10:54] brother brother Hank sister Martha
[10:56] joined the family they were baptized in
[10:57] the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[11:02] Zach black was already part of the
[11:03] family he just wanted to affirm a little
[11:05] more of his of his baptism so we thank
[11:08] for that you know a lot of times you see
[11:11] you try to uh
[11:14] I think everybody got it but you really
[11:16] you want them to see that name because
[11:18] it's a name that we're identified with
[11:20] we're identified with the name of Jesus
[11:23] and if we'll not shun it here see in
[11:26] other words he'll take our name there
[11:29] you know so we we just thank the Lord
[11:31] that that we have grace and mercy and
[11:34] I want to uh call a brother's name out
[11:37] in Oklahoma his name's brother Tim
[11:39] and Tim fugit he's a solid member of the
[11:43] umbrella claude's Church they put a
[11:45] couple of stents in his heart either
[11:48] last night or first thing this morning
[11:49] so he's doing okay and uh but just keep
[11:52] him in your prayers his name is brother
[11:54] Tim Fugate so we're going to speak
[11:57] tonight on a subject that sometimes
[11:59] words are
[12:01] are being used and I know brother Dale's
[12:03] trying to fly through a lot of things
[12:05] and and he's trying to
[12:07] to uh to get a thought across to us
[12:09] which sometimes we don't get it it's not
[12:12] that he's sometimes we don't get it it's
[12:14] not that he's not getting it across it's
[12:15] just we don't get it but uh when we put
[12:18] out words but tonight we're going to
[12:19] speak on a new body
[12:22] a new body all right just to maybe help
[12:25] some of the young ones and
[12:27] and I've never seen it not help the old
[12:30] ones either right
[12:31] right so
[12:33] word's Eternal right right amen same
[12:36] yesterday today and forever so I believe
[12:38] it'll help us too and I think some of
[12:40] you that were in the Sunday School
[12:41] Sunday school class this past weekend
[12:43] you're going to get another taste of
[12:46] what we were talking about which had
[12:47] nothing to do with the subject matter
[12:48] but we got on it so
[12:50] I believe the Lord kind of wanted us to
[12:52] stay on on that line so Philippians 3
[12:55] verse 20. let's buy our heads before we
[12:58] get started Heavenly Father we pray
[13:00] tonight Lord that you would come Among
[13:01] Us in a special way
[13:03] that you would come down in the hearts
[13:05] of the Believers and Quicken the word
[13:07] that's being spoken and let it not be my
[13:09] words Lord but let it be the words
[13:11] of the Almighty
[13:13] father we're going to read your word
[13:15] we're going to read what your Prophet
[13:17] had to say Lord and
[13:18] I pray that somewhere in there that that
[13:21] we'll see as the song goes I want to see
[13:24] you and that means understand
[13:26] I want to understand you it many people
[13:28] saw you when you were here on the Earth
[13:30] and
[13:31] and they didn't understand you
[13:34] but on the day of Pentecost when you
[13:35] came into the hearts of the believer
[13:36] Peter understood
[13:38] he could see you Lord
[13:40] because he knew that there was something
[13:43] different in his life
[13:45] that he'd been made new father we pray
[13:48] that you'd be with the sick ones Among
[13:49] Us Lord just you said you sent your word
[13:51] and healed them
[13:52] and delivered them from their
[13:53] destruction so I pray Lord that you
[13:54] would just touch them tonight as we
[13:57] endeavored to speak about you Lord and
[13:59] be with the ones that are not here be
[14:00] with the ones Lord that are sin sick we
[14:02] pray for the ones lord always that are
[14:04] down below our feet right now on the
[14:06] wall
[14:07] lord of the ones that are away from us
[14:09] Lord away from the Lord but Lord Jesus
[14:11] we we were all on that wall at one time
[14:15] and then we come off that wall by your
[14:17] grace and father we're believing these
[14:19] these names will materialize into the
[14:22] building father
[14:23] we pray now that you'd be with brother
[14:25] Tim Lord bless him we count him as a
[14:27] bosom friend and a good brother Lord
[14:29] there brother Claude we pray now that
[14:31] you just continue to be with him
[14:33] lead him and guide him by the Holy
[14:34] Spirit Lord we ask just bless us take
[14:36] care of us
[14:37] lead us and guide us here tonight in
[14:38] Jesus name amen
[14:41] Philippians 3 verse 20 for our
[14:43] conversation is in heaven
[14:45] from whence also we look for the savior
[14:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ there's that
[14:49] name
[14:50] who shall change our vile body
[14:53] that it may be fashioned now that word
[14:56] fashion you remember if you'll remember
[14:58] we're still on Genesis we're going to
[14:59] read Genesis 1 26 at the last of the
[15:01] service this has a lot to do with the
[15:04] Genesis 1 26 man
[15:06] so we're still on Genesis 1 26. if you
[15:09] can remember that remember we looked at
[15:11] the word created
[15:12] the word created is not in that form was
[15:15] not bringing it from nothing like God
[15:17] did the Earth and in bringing something
[15:18] it was fashioned the word created means
[15:22] fashion all right so who shall change
[15:25] our vowel body that it may be created
[15:27] we can say the same thing like unto his
[15:30] glorious body according to the working
[15:32] whereby he is able even to subdue all
[15:36] things unto itself now let's read First
[15:38] Corinthians 15.
[15:40] then you can be seated so also as a
[15:43] resurrection of the dead it is sown in
[15:44] corruption it is raised in incorruption
[15:47] right
[15:49] that's what we do when we when people
[15:50] die we plant them
[15:52] we sow them we sew them back into the
[15:54] ground all right
[15:57] but if they've got the Holy Spirit
[16:00] go back to the Romans 8 it says if the
[16:02] spirit of him to raise up Jesus from the
[16:03] dead dwell in your law so quick in your
[16:05] mortal body so it'll bring you back out
[16:06] it is sown in corruption it is raised in
[16:09] incorruption
[16:11] it is sown in dishonor it is raised in
[16:14] glory it is sown in weakness it is
[16:17] raised in power boy when this thing
[16:19] comes back up something's going to
[16:20] happen
[16:21] it is sown a natural body
[16:24] now we know that because I'm looking at
[16:26] it
[16:27] all right it is sown a natural body
[16:30] it has raised the spiritual body there
[16:33] is a natural body and there's a
[16:35] spiritual body you may be seated in The
[16:37] Lord At His blessings to the reading of
[16:39] the word
[16:40] laughs
[16:42] now
[16:43] I feel a little handicapped remember I
[16:44] told you one time about my iPad that I
[16:46] always brought my Bible up here because
[16:48] this thing doesn't need batteries well
[16:50] my iPad needs batteries today so
[16:53] it's back there healing is sick
[16:56] it needs hands laid on it
[16:59] not swiftly though you might break
[17:01] something
[17:02] but we look at this phrase and we we see
[17:05] where
[17:06] our conversation is in heaven from which
[17:09] we also look for the savior of the Lord
[17:10] Jesus Christ who shall change our vile
[17:12] body now we all know for one thing
[17:15] everybody's sitting here tonight was
[17:17] born the exact same way
[17:20] let's be loudly 60 of us in here tonight
[17:23] let's be loud Say Amen
[17:25] okay
[17:26] but we all know we came from the same
[17:28] place from the same act and we got the
[17:30] same flesh
[17:31] all right our bodies are made of the
[17:35] same 16 elements of the earth yours is
[17:36] not different than mine it may look
[17:38] different but it's the same 16 basic
[17:42] elements of the Earth all right let's
[17:44] read that quote there number one in
[17:46] Hebrews chapter one and then we'll get
[17:48] started brother Brown says now our
[17:50] bodies are made out of 16 different
[17:52] elements of the world we know that it's
[17:54] made up potash and a little calcium and
[17:56] petroleum Cosmic light and atoms and so
[17:59] forth
[18:00] all bundled together and makes this body
[18:03] comes from the dust of the Earth
[18:05] now does everybody understand how that
[18:07] happens
[18:08] your mother and your father eats beans
[18:12] and taters
[18:14] for those of you that are watching
[18:16] tonight taters is potatoes
[18:19] but your mama eats beans your daddy eats
[18:22] taters they eat good old deer meat they
[18:26] eat steak
[18:27] and all that goes into their body
[18:30] and guess what
[18:33] that's where you come from
[18:36] right there's no other way
[18:38] the chemical elements go into your body
[18:40] your body separates you what a wonderful
[18:42] thing this body is even in a fallen
[18:43] condition that it breaks those elements
[18:46] down puts it into blood it goes into
[18:48] highly congealed blood which is sperm
[18:50] and then when Mom and Dad gets together
[18:51] boom there you are you come from every
[18:54] person on this Earth came from the 16
[18:56] elements of this Earth all right that's
[18:59] why brother Branham could say that your
[19:01] body was in this earth
[19:03] in the beginning
[19:06] is everybody okay with that
[19:08] this if this break when this breaks down
[19:10] because the Lord told Adam said from
[19:13] thus you came and from dust you'll
[19:15] return all right so you'll go right back
[19:18] to the dust that was on the earth now
[19:20] now listen we were not made for that
[19:25] so keep this in your mind this is
[19:27] permissive will
[19:29] this is the permitted way of God but I'm
[19:31] going to read you an outstanding quote
[19:33] here in a little while where brother
[19:35] Branham takes that apart and watch how
[19:37] he watch how he words it but it'll be
[19:39] the last quote on the page
[19:41] from this part
[19:43] Karen said I've got 45 minutes because
[19:45] all these other preachers have took off
[19:47] all my time
[19:48] that's been preaching so I'm just only
[19:50] get 45 minutes
[19:51] but he says you eat food I don't listen
[19:53] to what he says either you eat food
[19:56] as you eat the food that turns from dust
[20:00] and it it turns from the dust and it
[20:02] comes from the dust and it just goes
[20:04] right on your flesh as far as your flesh
[20:07] is no different from a horse
[20:09] from a cow or anything else it's still
[20:11] just flash does everybody understand
[20:13] that
[20:15] as I was explaining to him in the in the
[20:17] Sunday school class Sunday
[20:19] this is the highest form of animal flesh
[20:23] now look the Genesis 1 26 man
[20:27] it's not this flesh
[20:29] everybody got that say Amen
[20:31] that's the spirit man that come from God
[20:34] that was eternal that was created by God
[20:36] or fashioned by God that had nothing to
[20:39] do with your first birth
[20:42] amen but it has a lot to do with your
[20:45] second birth amen and it has a lot to do
[20:47] with getting you back into the Garden of
[20:49] Eden because the Bible says flesh and
[20:51] blood will not inherit the Kingdom
[20:55] right so look I want to show you
[20:57] something and I it's let me finish this
[21:00] quote it's still just flesh and boy you
[21:03] glorify the flesh but that Spirit has a
[21:05] soul in there my brother that's right
[21:06] but your flesh is just dust of the earth
[21:08] like the animal so what I was explaining
[21:10] to him for those of you that are new and
[21:13] you know the Garden of Eden we don't
[21:15] believe it was an apple we believe it
[21:16] was a sexual Affair between Eve and the
[21:18] Beast well the Beast is the missing link
[21:20] all right the Beast had animal flesh
[21:24] so when God put that 126 man into the
[21:29] 2-7 man which was the flesh man Adam and
[21:32] Eve
[21:33] and boy I got a revelation on that today
[21:35] but I'll leave it for something else
[21:38] because remember
[21:41] Eve was fashioned after who
[21:45] Adam
[21:49] she had to come forth from Adam
[21:51] in order to reproduce Adam
[21:55] way with you and I
[21:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[22:00] must be made in His image
[22:02] to come back to bring him forth he can't
[22:04] do it by himself
[22:06] you say he can't he said he couldn't
[22:09] he's got to do it with a bride Adam
[22:11] couldn't reproduce himself
[22:13] is that right Adam's alone he's standing
[22:16] by himself he can't reproduce himself
[22:18] God said I'll make you help me I'll make
[22:20] you somebody that can reproduce you well
[22:22] that's what he's doing to you and I when
[22:24] he made that Genesis 1 26 man same thing
[22:26] as when he took Adam and parted Eve out
[22:28] of her out of him
[22:31] there stands God the male and he just
[22:33] Parts the female sure we say male and
[22:34] female created he them but it's his
[22:36] bride it's us it's male and female in
[22:39] gender
[22:41] but remember we're all female in the
[22:43] body of Christ so I got a little bit on
[22:45] that which is which is really good but
[22:47] we're animal flesh and that animal flesh
[22:51] was put in on the Earth
[22:54] and it was just a higher form so you had
[22:56] you had the animals you had look at your
[22:58] creation you had your lower form then
[23:00] you had your walking animals and then
[23:02] you had the upright
[23:03] then you had man
[23:05] so this is in the image of animal flesh
[23:09] the soul is not in the image of animal
[23:12] flesh
[23:13] okay
[23:15] that soul don't I don't say it doesn't
[23:17] have anything to do with it but it's not
[23:19] made the same way as the flesh man's
[23:21] made all right so you got two things
[23:23] that you got to deal with but I want to
[23:25] deal with something tonight because I
[23:26] don't want us to be and I was talking to
[23:28] brother Bob in the back and he'd looked
[23:29] up the exact same word I don't want you
[23:32] know you say well you're I'm dogmatic
[23:34] about something
[23:35] have you ever looked that word up
[23:40] dogmatic means expressing personal
[23:43] opinions
[23:45] our beliefs and you know where that work
[23:46] dogmatic come from
[23:48] look at the one above it
[23:51] brother Brown said what has been bound
[23:53] the Holy Ghost has been bound by what
[23:54] Creeds and
[23:56] Dogma
[23:57] for two thousand years of belief or set
[23:59] of beliefs that is accepted by the
[24:01] members of a group without being
[24:03] questioned or doubted
[24:05] so when we talk about a new body and
[24:08] somebody points to this thing right here
[24:10] let's be careful
[24:13] let's be careful let's don't be so
[24:15] dogmatic
[24:16] yeah
[24:19] I like that word dog
[24:21] except with a W on it
[24:25] somebody will catch that somebody won't
[24:28] but anyway
[24:31] but listen but most do
[24:33] so
[24:35] let's don't be so dogmatic when we point
[24:38] to this thing right here
[24:40] because remember
[24:42] Flesh and Blood can't inherit the
[24:44] Kingdom we got to go back to scripture
[24:48] we got to go back to scripture and see
[24:51] something here because scripture says
[24:53] flesh and blood will not inherit the
[24:54] Kingdom but now we've got to go through
[24:57] a transformation
[24:58] or a change
[25:01] are
[25:04] let's just read this from number two
[25:07] I I just don't want us to be so when we
[25:09] have new ones come in and and we point
[25:12] to this thing and say this right here is
[25:13] going to be changed
[25:15] well it makes your minds Wonder well
[25:17] this thing is is stinky smelly It's
[25:20] gotta eat it's rotten it's
[25:23] anybody understand what I'm talking
[25:24] about
[25:25] okay so let's don't be so dogmatic and
[25:28] say it's got to be this right here the
[25:30] whole thing all right
[25:31] because let me ask you one question if
[25:33] you do that then it's like brother Bob
[25:35] and I were talking in the back brother
[25:37] uh hantus preached a sermon on me about
[25:40] 35 or 40 years ago when I was a young
[25:43] kid in this church when it was this way
[25:46] and he proved that every seven years
[25:48] your body goes to a transformation but
[25:50] every seven years also there's more of
[25:52] you in the septic tank than there is
[25:54] standing here
[25:58] right hello
[26:00] now realize that when you wash everybody
[26:03] else is thinking the other thing I'm
[26:05] talking about washing the skin off
[26:07] now look if God brings all that back
[26:12] and every fingernail I clip off and
[26:14] every hair I clip off through my life
[26:17] that ain't gonna be right
[26:19] so let's be don't be so dogmatic when we
[26:21] say this thing right here has got to be
[26:23] it's what's got to be changed
[26:26] okay now I want to make one thing clear
[26:29] this body is going to be changed amen
[26:32] this body is redeemed amen but remember
[26:36] brother Brown I'll read you in just a
[26:37] minute
[26:38] let's read this right here what is these
[26:41] bodies made out of a little Cosmic light
[26:42] a few atoms and a petroleum so forth put
[26:45] together that God brought out of the
[26:47] Dust of the earth and painted a picture
[26:50] and we're only living in the negative
[26:52] now so this is negative
[26:54] right amen
[26:56] there's nothing positive about this
[26:59] that's what's on the inside
[27:01] and we're only limiting the negative now
[27:02] in some Glorious Day death will develop
[27:04] the picture right
[27:06] right and we'll return again in a new
[27:08] glorified
[27:10] body to never be old never be sick never
[27:13] have a heartache now it's going to
[27:14] Isaiah 65.
[27:16] and let's look at that word new for
[27:17] behold I create new Heavens right
[27:20] and new earth in the former shall not be
[27:23] remembered nor come into mind now most
[27:25] denominational people preach that we're
[27:29] going to heaven
[27:30] and this world is going to be destroyed
[27:32] because they take says behold I create
[27:34] new heaven in the earth then we're going
[27:35] to read Peter second Peter where it says
[27:37] behold the day of the Lords as a thief
[27:38] in the night seeing that all things
[27:40] shall be dissolved what man or person
[27:42] are we to be you know don't you don't go
[27:43] to it yet
[27:45] so we got to bring these things together
[27:47] we got to see when God says I create new
[27:50] heavens and new earth remember that word
[27:53] create is fashion
[27:55] now that word new
[27:58] in that context there in the Hebrew
[28:00] lexicon strong number 2318 you can bring
[28:02] it up
[28:04] to be new renew or repair
[28:10] everybody got that so it's not
[28:12] Annihilation right
[28:15] right all right I want to get that in
[28:16] your mind it's not Annihilation we do
[28:19] not believe that anything of this I
[28:21] cannot be annihilated if I'm born again
[28:26] okay
[28:27] if I'm born again like I said about Paul
[28:30] poor Paul they put his head on a
[28:32] shopping block they chopped his head off
[28:33] when he stepped over into that sixth
[28:35] Dimension he didn't have to pick his
[28:36] head up off the floor right
[28:38] so man couldn't hurt that soul that was
[28:41] Paul that person that he was
[28:45] right can we say that person that was
[28:46] the real Paul
[28:48] the real Paul was inside there but look
[28:50] it says to be new renew or repair to
[28:54] make a new to repair to renew oneself
[28:56] and keep going
[28:58] to the next one
[29:00] I like this one go to the next one
[29:03] this is new new thing are fresh
[29:08] so what's God going to do he's with
[29:10] somebody I created in new heavens and a
[29:11] new Earth well the denomination says
[29:13] well he's going to do away with the
[29:15] Earth and do away with the heavens
[29:17] and we're gonna go live on a cloud
[29:21] Isaiah 44 says I made this Earth to be
[29:24] inhabited now if the word of God is
[29:26] eternal there's an eternal thought
[29:28] Eternal thought of God being expressed
[29:30] he made this world to be made eternal
[29:36] right all right so if our bodies were in
[29:39] that Earth
[29:41] they're going to be made eternal
[29:44] got it all right
[29:46] so now let's go to Second Peter verse 3.
[29:50] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[29:52] thief in the night
[29:53] in which the heavens shall pass away
[29:56] with a great noise
[29:58] and the element shall melt with fervent
[30:00] heat the Earth also so he's saying the
[30:02] Earth's going to pass away
[30:04] well now that word passed away I didn't
[30:06] bring it because it's a big old long
[30:07] word it starts with a P
[30:09] but it's not as we say
[30:13] pass away in other words do away with
[30:16] all right
[30:17] it's something God's made I've always
[30:20] said in the six days of creation
[30:22] whatever God created that's eternal
[30:27] are you wouldn't have said it
[30:30] right the Earth the Sun the moon not
[30:33] exactly the same animals come on people
[30:36] but when he spoke something how are you
[30:38] going to make it any go any other way
[30:40] all right
[30:41] because the animals they're going to be
[30:43] made eternal they fell because we fell
[30:46] right
[30:47] right when we make it back they're going
[30:48] to automatically make it back all right
[30:50] but a day of the Lord will come as a
[30:53] thief in the night which the heaven
[30:54] shall pass away with a great noise the
[30:55] element shall melt with fervent Heat the
[30:58] Earth also in the works of the therein
[31:00] shall be burned up
[31:01] The Works look at that word works
[31:04] seeing then that all these things shall
[31:06] be dissolved
[31:09] what things
[31:11] Heavens earth right
[31:13] see and then that all these things shall
[31:15] be dissolved what manner of person
[31:16] thought would it be in all holy
[31:18] conversation and godliness
[31:20] looking for and Hasting unto the coming
[31:22] of the day of God wherein the heavens
[31:23] being on fire shall be dissolved
[31:26] and the element shall melt with fervent
[31:28] heat nevertheless we according to his
[31:32] promise look for new heavens and a new
[31:35] Earth wherein dwelleth
[31:37] righteousness
[31:39] all right so it says new
[31:41] that word new remember means renew
[31:44] we're gonna he's gonna take this Earth
[31:46] and he's going to burn it over
[31:52] right and then he's what's he gonna do
[31:54] we're going to come back on this Earth
[31:58] but remember this is the first Earth
[32:01] that's going to be changed right amen
[32:03] this okay
[32:05] so it's not a different Earth it's not
[32:06] we got to go to another world to get a
[32:08] body we're not aliens
[32:10] We're Not Angels either we're human
[32:12] beings
[32:14] all right Revelations 21 1. I want to
[32:17] you know just for the ones that kind of
[32:19] you know you for the first time when I
[32:21] read the Bible you you have a lot of
[32:23] questions and I thank God for Bible
[32:25] studying and things like that all over
[32:27] the years that we're in a prophet that
[32:29] could tell us because you look at
[32:31] Revelations 21 I saw a new Heaven and a
[32:33] new Earth
[32:35] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[32:36] were passed away
[32:37] now that word passed away is that big
[32:39] old long word pair of whatever it is
[32:42] and it just me it doesn't mean to
[32:44] annihilate it just means to burn over
[32:47] all right what's going to happen is this
[32:50] is what this is what I was looking for
[32:54] when I was studying over this and and
[32:57] realizing that maybe sometimes we when
[33:00] we say the word new our mind goes to
[33:03] throw this one away and get another one
[33:05] most people denomination and most people
[33:08] in this message
[33:09] believe that you're gonna this one's
[33:11] gonna be done away with and you're going
[33:12] to get a brand new one well then brother
[33:14] Brandon will say we'll get a new one
[33:17] got to know what that new means
[33:19] got to know what that knew where that
[33:20] new comes from too all right and I John
[33:24] saw the holy city
[33:26] where's it coming
[33:28] now if he annihilated A New Earth or if
[33:31] he made a new or if he annihilated the
[33:32] Earth where's this holy city coming this
[33:35] New Jerusalem is coming down out of
[33:36] heaven and it's going to set down on
[33:38] this new Earth
[33:40] all right now look at number three
[33:42] future home
[33:45] these processes make us clean he's
[33:48] talking about us going through
[33:49] justification sanctification of baptism
[33:50] of the Holy Ghost with fire that does
[33:53] the cleansing of our this Temple
[33:56] so as old world frame did not destroy
[34:00] now let's hang on to that word frame
[34:05] By the Waters when it was washed off the
[34:08] frame of the planet the old frame all
[34:10] the dirt all the stuff that God put on
[34:11] the Earth was not destroyed when the
[34:13] first world was destroyed and the Bible
[34:15] said it was destroyed
[34:17] but it never destroyed the frame it just
[34:19] destroyed the sin and sinners that was
[34:21] on it the framework remained
[34:26] all right so the framework remained
[34:30] this is your framework your body is made
[34:34] of Bones and flesh that is the framework
[34:36] of you it's what holds you together
[34:38] right
[34:40] so this is the framework so the
[34:42] framework stays the same
[34:46] you go down black-headed you're going to
[34:48] come up black-headed well if you go down
[34:50] gray-headed and you was black-headed
[34:52] You're Gonna Come Back black-headed all
[34:54] right let me clear that up so if but if
[34:57] you go down brother Brown says short
[34:59] tall the framework's going to stay the
[35:02] same right
[35:03] and I'm going to show you something here
[35:05] in a minute that'll really help you on
[35:06] that
[35:07] but let's go to the Greek Lexicon we
[35:09] were talking about this downstairs and
[35:11] and I it's it's easy to see this process
[35:17] but that it goes through a change this
[35:19] Greek Lexington if you go to the word
[35:21] baptizo all right
[35:24] now have you ever looked this up
[35:26] kind of funny but
[35:29] makes a point
[35:31] to dip repeatedly to immerse to submerge
[35:33] we did that we baptized our brother
[35:36] right right all right but now he's got
[35:38] to be baptized with the Holy Ghost to
[35:41] change him all right so that's what the
[35:43] baptizo is to baptize wash
[35:47] now look around here
[35:49] too overwhelmed look at number three
[35:51] to overwhelm not to be confused with
[35:55] which is 9 11 which is
[35:58] bapto
[36:00] Baptist the baptism service the bat the
[36:03] bad putting them in the water and
[36:04] bringing them out all right the clearest
[36:06] example that shows the meaning of
[36:07] baptizo is the text from the Greek poet
[36:10] and physician nikander who lived around
[36:12] 200 BC it is a recipe for making pickles
[36:18] and it's helpful because it uses both
[36:20] words nikander says that in order to
[36:23] make a pickle the vegetables should
[36:25] first be dipped right
[36:29] it's still a cucumber
[36:33] it looks like a cucumber tastes like a
[36:35] cucumber acts like a cucumber amen
[36:38] the Frameworks of a cucumber's there
[36:42] but
[36:45] you put it in a process you put it into
[36:46] boiling water and then baptized our
[36:49] baptizo which goes back to where bro
[36:51] where Jesus said I baptized you with
[36:53] Holy Ghost you'll be baptized with Holy
[36:55] Ghost and Fire all right so that's the
[36:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost you Bab type
[36:59] baptizo in the vinegar solution both
[37:02] verbs concern the immersing of
[37:04] vegetables in a solution but the first
[37:06] is temporary
[37:09] look like a cucumber act like a cucumber
[37:13] you wash it with a little water you're
[37:15] still going to look like a cucumber
[37:16] you're still going to act like a
[37:17] cucumber you're still going to taste
[37:18] like a cucumber
[37:20] but
[37:22] the first is temporary the second the
[37:24] act of baptizing the vegetable
[37:27] produces a permanent change
[37:30] once you take a cucumber through the
[37:33] pickling process
[37:35] it can never turn back into a cucumber
[37:37] again
[37:38] yet it looks like a cucumber may still
[37:42] act like a cucumber it's not going to
[37:43] taste like a cucumber but it does taste
[37:45] a little like a cucumber
[37:47] so it's the framework it's meant what
[37:49] I'm trying to say is it's the framework
[37:50] when we baptize with the Holy Ghost
[37:52] we've still got the same framework
[37:56] all right
[37:58] but
[37:59] let me ask you a question
[38:03] brother Brown makes a point of saying
[38:07] that
[38:08] when we reach a certain age that that's
[38:11] the age that you know we're full of life
[38:13] and he said you know 20 or whatever I'm
[38:16] going to read it in just a second
[38:18] but I want you to realize something I
[38:20] want you to think
[38:24] did he take a picture
[38:27] of you at your youth here
[38:31] how many of your sisters that 20 year
[38:33] old had short hair
[38:35] raise your hand
[38:37] I mean your sisters at 20 had earrings
[38:39] in your ear
[38:40] oh boy
[38:42] how many of you never mind how many of
[38:44] you had tattoos
[38:45] never mind don't worry about don't
[38:47] answer that don't raise your hand I
[38:49] don't want to know
[38:51] but is that what you're going to be
[38:52] changed back to
[38:56] so is it this thing right here
[39:03] Jim's hair was as short as mine when she
[39:05] was 20 years old is that the picture God
[39:07] saw
[39:13] all right
[39:15] she's not going to be in glory with
[39:16] short hair
[39:19] amen
[39:20] some of you at 20 years old already had
[39:22] children
[39:23] that gonna happen
[39:25] no that changed you a little bit
[39:28] right
[39:29] is that what's coming is that what God
[39:31] saw
[39:32] I don't think so
[39:35] he's dealing with the framework though
[39:38] he's dealing with the framework that you
[39:40] are
[39:42] I'm going to read you some quotes here
[39:43] you you make your choice I I'm just
[39:45] telling you when we get so dogmatic that
[39:47] we have to we have to hone in on
[39:49] something that's our idea and then we
[39:51] let the prophet in the Bible tell us
[39:53] that not exactly the same gases are
[39:56] going to come back
[39:58] then is it this very thing
[40:01] I don't think so
[40:03] but now remember let me make a point we
[40:06] don't believe in getting a new one right
[40:09] we're going to keep this framework
[40:12] this framework stays
[40:14] we're gonna have hands we're going to be
[40:16] a human we're going to not turn into
[40:17] angels
[40:19] we're not going to be Spooks we're gonna
[40:22] have flesh
[40:24] and one of our sisters in the Sunday
[40:25] school class
[40:26] she'll remain it the person will remain
[40:29] nameless
[40:31] how to shout and fit this this Sunday
[40:35] she figured that we could eat
[40:38] when we come back to the future home
[40:41] and they're not going to be no calories
[40:47] I said somebody ought to penicillin
[40:49] there'll be no calories in glory
[40:54] we are going to eat aren't we
[40:56] right remember they're not in the sixth
[40:58] Dimension they're not in flesh so
[40:59] they're not in their right to be
[41:01] conditioned
[41:02] right they're not in the right framework
[41:06] right is that okay they're not in the
[41:08] right framework they're not in their
[41:10] framework there is spiritual right
[41:13] Supernatural
[41:14] in another dimension
[41:17] but they're coming back here to pick up
[41:19] their body their framework
[41:25] man they're not coming back here to pick
[41:26] up short hair sisters right
[41:29] so where do animals come from let's read
[41:32] a quote though in demonology let's read
[41:34] paragraph 43 just save time
[41:37] I made I made no I won't I was going to
[41:40] say 45 minutes is enough when God gave
[41:42] you this life and you was at your best
[41:44] at about 23 when you come into the
[41:47] resurrection you'll come back just
[41:48] exactly like he was when you was 23
[41:51] years old or 25 four deaths and then
[41:53] death will have everything that it can
[41:55] do
[41:56] it is set there but you'll come right
[41:58] back
[41:59] the way you were now if you leave that
[42:01] the way it is
[42:02] then it looks like it's this same one
[42:04] coming back
[42:07] can't be
[42:10] everybody understand that are you quiet
[42:12] but that's fine with me I want you to
[42:13] think about it
[42:15] if you bring your 20 year old body back
[42:17] that you lived in down here on the earth
[42:19] the exact same one I'm telling you I
[42:21] just gave you 100 examples
[42:24] you're gonna have tattoos you're gonna
[42:25] have holes in your ears so maybe you'll
[42:27] have holes in your nose
[42:30] you understand what I mean I mean
[42:31] there's things that goes on in this
[42:32] human life that happens that it's like
[42:36] brother Danny you know getting all broke
[42:37] up and got pins and and all kinds of
[42:39] things in them you know and
[42:41] I'd love to go to the airport with him
[42:42] I'd love to see that thing go off
[42:44] in the uh
[42:46] in the uh go through the line there I'd
[42:48] love for them to say come back here just
[42:50] a minute what is that
[42:52] you know he's got that big old rod in
[42:53] his in his leg but you know what that is
[42:56] not going to Glory right
[42:59] that's not going with him there's not
[43:01] going to be a scar if you were 20 years
[43:03] old and you had a scar over an injury
[43:04] that's not what you're coming back to
[43:06] all right but we gotta look though and
[43:10] we got to see where that Genesis one man
[43:11] fits in this whole thing
[43:13] because remember the Genesis 1 26 man
[43:15] never sinned
[43:17] never had an earring
[43:19] never had short hair sisters
[43:21] never had tattoos
[43:23] never had a baby
[43:27] right
[43:28] all right so let's put this thing
[43:30] together let's look at number five
[43:32] why are my people so tossed about
[43:35] did you ever think that when your spirit
[43:37] leaves you if you was in a gas chamber
[43:39] if he was in the bottom of a well bottom
[43:41] of the sea or wherever it may be when
[43:43] your spirit leaves you water fire
[43:45] nothing can hold it it moves right
[43:47] through the building it's like a vapor
[43:49] it hangs there it's alive it can't die
[43:52] it's got eternal life it can't perish
[43:53] now he's talking about your soul he's
[43:54] not talking about your body all right
[43:56] then when you die and your loved ones
[43:58] are Weeping they think you're dead
[44:02] but you're not
[44:03] even if you're a sinner you're not I put
[44:06] that in you're still living up here the
[44:08] old body's past faded away but it's put
[44:12] down into the ground all the adamance
[44:15] things that you once was has broken up
[44:17] and gone back into the cosmic light and
[44:19] petroleum or whatever it was gone back
[44:22] into the Earth and someday the great
[44:23] king of these spirits will come Jesus
[44:25] coming from glory in his body amen let's
[44:28] keep going he'll turn loose the power of
[44:31] God and every person that's in him their
[44:34] bodies them atoms will start going
[44:36] together the cosmic light will start
[44:38] making this autumn this is wonderful
[44:41] we'll start making up and in a moment's
[44:43] time every person that's in Christ will
[44:46] be changed and made a young man and
[44:48] woman again standing on the Earth
[44:51] everybody got that same man
[44:53] oh my what what a wonderful time that
[44:57] God has laid these things out for us
[45:00] but I want you to see I want you to look
[45:01] at this one this is 1964. this is after
[45:05] the seals all right just think of the
[45:07] arena in the days of the early martyrs
[45:09] that when those Christians were thrown
[45:11] into Lion's dens and those lines killed
[45:13] the Christians and eat up their bodies
[45:15] see yet they were scattered their body
[45:17] was in the wastage of the line across
[45:19] the face of the Earth no matter where it
[45:21] is you can't see you're made up of a
[45:22] substance that's unseen made material
[45:25] and God will give that substance back
[45:27] see now like you take a cell you break
[45:30] it down from a cell it comes in a Cell
[45:32] in a Cell an atom and a molecule and on
[45:34] down like that finally it ends up into
[45:35] the Unseen it goes from a natural
[45:37] something you put your hands on to gases
[45:41] from gases into acid acid into gases and
[45:44] gases on back like that this is a
[45:45] seventh grade education man explaining
[45:47] this
[45:49] and the scientists are going how does he
[45:51] know that
[45:54] it's just simple to me really
[45:57] ashes into gases and gases on back like
[45:59] that until it finally all winds up to
[46:01] one little thing in that is Spirit
[46:03] and their Spirit who has occupied these
[46:06] gases it might not be the same gases
[46:10] right
[46:12] but the features of what you are right
[46:15] framework
[46:18] will be exactly what they are again
[46:21] see the spirit has control that
[46:28] what spirit
[46:30] the Holy Spirit right if you don't have
[46:32] the Holy Spirit you're going to come
[46:33] back up in the whole body that you lived
[46:35] in because you ain't got nothing to
[46:36] change you
[46:38] but what is that spirit
[46:41] I said Genesis 1 26 man amen
[46:44] amen the one God saw
[46:46] before the foundation of the world right
[46:50] and now in other words when you become a
[46:51] young man or a young woman and like God
[46:53] takes a picture of you
[46:55] now no matter how old and wrinkled how
[46:57] disfigured whatever it will be that will
[46:59] wind right on down through
[47:01] and that body may be destroyed
[47:04] disfigured burnt eat up by lines
[47:06] whatever it is
[47:07] but it was made up of gases 16 elements
[47:10] of the Earth
[47:12] that was calcium and potassium petroleum
[47:14] and consonant light and so forth all
[47:16] goes together to make up the body
[47:19] all right pretty simple now no matter
[47:21] that's the whole Earth is filled with
[47:23] that
[47:24] see in other words those 16 elements are
[47:27] common elements they're everywhere all
[47:29] right but now this picture is the main
[47:33] thing
[47:36] then in the resurrection those gases and
[47:39] Ashes and things comes right back into
[47:40] the place and develops this picture
[47:42] again
[47:44] now this picture was not taken when you
[47:47] were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your
[47:49] best right
[47:52] praise God
[47:54] you ought to say pray to God
[47:58] when was it taken right
[48:01] right when he said let us make man in
[48:05] our own image after our likeness and let
[48:08] them have dominion over the fish let's
[48:10] see in the foul the air that's what he's
[48:11] looking for
[48:13] that's what I enjoyed when Daddy
[48:15] preached matching pieces
[48:18] that's what we're going to match amen
[48:21] amen but it's going to be the same
[48:22] framework that you lived in down here
[48:24] because it can't be another person
[48:27] it's got to be the same frame right
[48:29] foreign
[48:30] I don't know whether we're going to be
[48:32] real tall or short or big or I don't
[48:34] know don't care
[48:36] I just know I'm gonna be 20 years old it
[48:38] ain't gonna matter
[48:40] because there's no calories in heaven
[48:43] or Earth
[48:45] there should be a song there somewhere
[48:48] before there was a foundation of the
[48:50] world it was put in God's Great file
[48:55] and then only thing it did was featured
[48:58] itself here for you to make your choice
[49:02] right
[49:05] foreknowledge right it has to be by
[49:09] foreknowledge if it's just by
[49:11] predestination it is God pulling you
[49:13] through a tube but for him to foreknow
[49:16] what you'd look like
[49:21] those who he foreknew
[49:25] he did predestinate
[49:27] to look like that
[49:30] right to look like what like you look
[49:31] now because I'm gonna read you a quote
[49:33] in a minute
[49:36] and then the only thing he did was
[49:37] featured himself here for you to make
[49:38] your choice then you become a servant of
[49:42] God him foreknowing it
[49:44] makes him a redeemer
[49:46] as we've been through it then that
[49:49] picture is absolutely this is the
[49:51] negative
[49:53] the negative part of life is where
[49:55] you're living now
[49:58] and anything if there is a negative
[50:00] there's got to be a positive before
[50:01] there can be a negative
[50:03] right
[50:05] therefore if this is a negative and
[50:07] there's got to be a positive somewhere
[50:08] and this ain't the real thing
[50:11] he can say ain't all he wants to I love
[50:13] that
[50:14] this ain't the real thing
[50:18] you reading that
[50:19] this ain't the real thing right
[50:22] we pamper
[50:24] and
[50:27] it ain't real
[50:29] black brother Harris you say this ain't
[50:31] so
[50:32] because this ain't what God wanted this
[50:34] is the permissive part of what God's
[50:36] letting happen all right but it's going
[50:37] to work right after this perfect will
[50:39] now you got it so I don't care what they
[50:42] would do with you
[50:46] that picture in God's Great Gallery up
[50:49] there it cannot destroy it it's in
[50:51] heaven
[50:54] now it's not hanging up in the cubicle
[50:56] somewhere right
[50:57] it's your theophany
[51:00] it's the real you
[51:02] 's who you are if you're born again
[51:07] you could burn it up feed it to the
[51:09] lines this is talking about the Natural
[51:10] Body now do it any way you want to it'll
[51:13] come forth again just as sure as I know
[51:16] he can spell two twos is four
[51:19] you heard me say spell no most of you
[51:21] didn't even hear what it said he can
[51:23] Cipher two twos is four just as sure as
[51:24] God spoke it it'll come forth so no
[51:27] matter where you are
[51:31] the framework
[51:33] in Ephesians 1 proves all this
[51:36] Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath
[51:38] chosen Us in him
[51:41] before
[51:43] he ever puts you in flesh amen
[51:46] amen can I say that or before the
[51:48] foundation of the world that we should
[51:50] be holy I I was looking up the scripture
[51:52] and I'm sorry I forgot I lost a little
[51:55] bit of time back there but the word
[51:57] preserved see that's the pickling
[51:59] process preserve we've been preserved
[52:01] God's preserved this whole thing and
[52:04] absolutely on God's side of the whole
[52:07] picture
[52:09] he saw us already changed
[52:12] already in glory already glorified those
[52:18] who he's Justified he's already
[52:19] glorified but we're on this side that's
[52:21] why you got to watch
[52:23] be careful don't be so dogmatic
[52:26] because we still living in a natural
[52:28] body
[52:28] we're still living the Natural Things of
[52:30] the Earth
[52:31] and we need a redeemer amen we need a
[52:34] redeemer until this body right here is
[52:36] changed
[52:38] amen
[52:39] amen so don't you forget that don't
[52:41] think you're something special something
[52:42] but you are
[52:43] God did preserve you he did he put you
[52:45] in a file you read that
[52:47] you know what his file is
[52:51] exactly this is his file it has 66
[52:55] different files in it
[52:58] and when you find yourself in this file
[53:00] you got yourself in the family
[53:03] you find yourself that's why we have to
[53:05] be identified with the name the Lord
[53:08] Jesus Christ because if we were chosen
[53:10] in father son Holy Ghost who's that
[53:15] do you understand that who's that who's
[53:17] father who
[53:19] son who
[53:22] no but when you say Lord Jesus Christ
[53:24] you know that you were preserved in him
[53:27] before the foundation of the world and
[53:29] in his mind it is it is all finished
[53:31] because remember he can't change his
[53:33] mind
[53:34] so when we when we were caught up in the
[53:37] fall that didn't change God's mind
[53:42] let's read this the interval
[53:45] 1956. here not long ago I was Coleman
[53:48] what Little Couple hairs I have left my
[53:49] wife said to me Billy you're getting
[53:51] bald-headed
[53:52] I said praise God I hadn't lost to one
[53:55] of them
[53:57] she said where are they at honey
[54:00] and I said I want to ask you and then
[54:02] I'll answer you I said where was they
[54:04] before I got them
[54:07] right you tell me where they was before
[54:09] they was here I'll tell you where they
[54:11] are waiting for me when I get there
[54:14] right Hallelujah
[54:15] that's right certainly there was one
[54:18] time they wasn't than they were then
[54:21] they wasn't
[54:24] yeah
[54:26] you read that one more time there was
[54:28] one time they wasn't before he was born
[54:30] then they were when he was young then it
[54:33] wasn't when he got old everybody okay
[54:35] with that and and where they was at the
[54:38] beginning when God put the body here in
[54:41] a shadow right
[54:43] hmm
[54:45] they'll be waiting for his second coming
[54:47] in glory when he will appear the second
[54:50] time in every item that holds me
[54:52] together
[54:53] excuse me every bit of cosmic Cosmic
[54:56] light will come together not in a sexual
[54:58] desire or a natural birth but through a
[55:01] recreation
[55:02] amen new
[55:04] I create a new Heaven
[55:06] and a new Earth same framework William
[55:09] Branham he's not going to look any
[55:11] different
[55:12] amen
[55:13] is everybody okay with this all right I
[55:16] just want everybody to see that what God
[55:18] has done for us already oh my this ain't
[55:20] enough oh my If That Ain't Enough wait a
[55:23] minute but through Recreation where
[55:26] almighty God will speak and the spirit
[55:28] will turn to the body and will live
[55:30] forever
[55:31] oh my if that ain't enough to set every
[55:33] Christian's heart into roaring with joy
[55:35] God has so ordained it so
[55:38] he proved it in his first miracle now I
[55:41] didn't think about this but this is
[55:42] correct he proved it in his first
[55:43] miracle he turned water to wine now you
[55:46] can through the process showing he
[55:49] bypassed the vine he just spoke from the
[55:51] water to the wine it actually would have
[55:53] been wine
[55:56] think about it put the water in the
[55:58] ground let it water the grates comes up
[56:00] through the grapevine goes out into the
[56:02] heads out in the grapes they take the
[56:04] grapes they mash it up and they make
[56:06] wine out of it
[56:08] most of your grapes is water
[56:12] melon are mostly
[56:15] water
[56:18] but God just bypass that see it actually
[56:21] would have been wine went up to the
[56:23] Grapevine and infirm it and ferment into
[56:25] that and turned into wine sure but God
[56:27] just spoke it and bypassed all that
[56:31] so will he in the resurrection
[56:34] of all the sexuals in marriage and
[56:36] things it'll all be done away with and
[56:37] God will just speak and we'll live again
[56:40] amen
[56:41] unveiling of God
[56:44] this is where I want you to see
[56:45] something
[56:48] because watch this master builder
[56:51] brother Dale's been preaching on the
[56:52] Masterpiece family
[56:54] but I want you to realize one thing
[56:56] that big piece of Rock
[56:58] the tech statue of Moses was in
[57:01] that statue was always in that piece of
[57:03] Rock
[57:05] I don't care if it was still laying down
[57:07] in the earth and they had to excavate it
[57:10] and dig it out right
[57:12] but that image of Moses was in that rock
[57:17] amen
[57:18] think about that like a man building
[57:21] Chimes or making Chimes the motor each
[57:22] Bale has got a ring different from the
[57:24] other the same materials
[57:27] but so much iron so much steel so much
[57:29] brass to make it give the team that's
[57:31] the way God did he bred this one to that
[57:34] one
[57:35] to this one to that one
[57:38] to this one to that one until he got
[57:40] exactly what he wanted
[57:43] that's how he come down God unveiled
[57:45] himself in the pillar of fire through
[57:47] the prophets then into the Son of God
[57:49] which he was God see it's the same God
[57:51] bringing out exactly from Perfection to
[57:54] Perfection from glory to glory he didn't
[57:55] stop there he said that's the way the
[57:57] church goes
[58:01] to get you here
[58:03] for that Genesis 1 26 image to be
[58:06] developed
[58:09] he brought this one to this one this one
[58:11] to this one
[58:13] because what you have to do when you get
[58:14] here
[58:16] enough
[58:18] do you have anything to do with you
[58:20] getting here
[58:21] no God did
[58:23] right that's why he preserved the whole
[58:25] thing that's why if you look at
[58:26] predestination in that way it looks like
[58:28] God did predestin but he did predestined
[58:31] by what he saw you would do when you got
[58:33] here
[58:34] so that Genesis 1 26 man comes to you
[58:37] and it's not a different looking person
[58:40] amen that's why God took that picture so
[58:42] now what are we going back to
[58:44] we're going back to what God saw in that
[58:46] picture
[58:49] not what man took a picture of you on
[58:53] the earth at 20 years old you're going
[58:55] back to that image because it's going to
[58:57] mold together
[59:00] your theophany is not tall and you're
[59:03] short or blackhead and you're
[59:05] brown-headed it all has to come together
[59:08] I wish you would understand something
[59:10] not talking about the genetics of God
[59:12] this just proves the whole thing
[59:15] we come straight from the genetics of
[59:17] God
[59:18] and God so much thought about it he took
[59:21] the natural genetics
[59:23] I told him up in Virginia and they're
[59:25] still preaching on it I told him I said
[59:27] you guys in Virginia I said you were in
[59:29] the Civil War
[59:31] 600 000 men boys most of them that had
[59:36] never been married never had children
[59:38] died in that war six hundred thousand
[59:42] Generations were wiped out
[59:44] and most of them was from Virginia
[59:47] and I looked at them as about 300 and I
[59:49] said somehow you got here
[59:52] somehow you got here
[59:54] because man destroyed 600 000
[59:56] Generations
[59:58] but somehow you made it through
[1:00:00] somehow that Guardian Angel kept your
[1:00:02] kinfo
[1:00:04] I believe that people
[1:00:06] I believe if God preserved it if he saw
[1:00:08] it before the foundation of the world
[1:00:10] he's obligated to get it here
[1:00:13] for us to make our choice that way we
[1:00:15] can tell Satan hey we made a choice man
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:18] right we were we we are different but
[1:00:20] yet we're not different right
[1:00:22] we are different in that we chose
[1:00:25] and God knew our choosing before the
[1:00:27] world and he can go all the way across
[1:00:30] time
[1:00:32] and put how many of you how many of you
[1:00:34] brothers and sisters
[1:00:37] don't even know how in the world you got
[1:00:39] together
[1:00:41] Boyd for sure June
[1:00:47] got both hands up
[1:00:51] if she had three she'd have been up
[1:00:55] but look
[1:00:57] do you understand what I'm saying God's
[1:00:59] preserved us
[1:01:01] he did make a way
[1:01:04] to get us here
[1:01:05] but remember he made a way to get us
[1:01:08] back
[1:01:09] what was lost was the way back
[1:01:12] Adam and Eve couldn't produce us or we
[1:01:15] wouldn't have needed Samuel and Peggy
[1:01:16] Dale
[1:01:18] but I need it after the fall I needed
[1:01:21] Samuel and Peggy Dale to put that same
[1:01:23] genetic line together to get me here to
[1:01:25] match that Genesis one man that's why
[1:01:27] this is a negative and that's the
[1:01:29] positive and that's what we're going to
[1:01:32] we're going to that positive so it's not
[1:01:35] a it's not brothers and sisters it's not
[1:01:37] a body
[1:01:39] that's new that's we're going to throw
[1:01:42] this one down and and God's going to
[1:01:44] just mold us another one no he thought
[1:01:46] so much of you
[1:01:50] somehow Brother Don he likes you
[1:01:53] brother dick
[1:01:55] Brother Dean
[1:01:57] there's something about your character
[1:02:01] that was in him not that he liked let me
[1:02:04] put it this way not that he'd like it
[1:02:06] was him
[1:02:08] because that Genesis 1 26 is the very
[1:02:10] attribute of almighty God
[1:02:15] there's no God
[1:02:17] had a relation with this one to bring
[1:02:20] we come straight from God
[1:02:24] so if that genetics hey if the genetic
[1:02:27] Line's strong down here what do you
[1:02:28] think about an eternal genetic
[1:02:30] what do you think about an eternal
[1:02:31] genetic code that can't be broke right
[1:02:34] that God's going to do everything he can
[1:02:36] when he gets you here he's going to lay
[1:02:38] it out there in front of you and you're
[1:02:40] going to have to make a choice but he
[1:02:41] sure knows what choice you're going to
[1:02:42] make
[1:02:45] so we're molding into that image
[1:02:48] that's the image we're looking at
[1:02:50] we got it backwards if this is a
[1:02:52] negative and that's the positive which
[1:02:54] one was first
[1:02:56] how many times did Brother around tell
[1:02:58] us that story
[1:02:59] which one's first
[1:03:01] the real picture or the negative he says
[1:03:03] to have a negative you already got to
[1:03:05] have the positive
[1:03:08] so that positive of Richard Marlow
[1:03:11] that he knew he was going to accept him
[1:03:13] he knew that he was going to accept God
[1:03:15] he knew he was going to be a child of
[1:03:16] God
[1:03:19] he got that he brought that genetic line
[1:03:21] down through human beings Brother Gary
[1:03:24] and there he says
[1:03:26] to make his choice but he's not going
[1:03:29] back you understand he's not going back
[1:03:30] to the 20 year old man he was on this
[1:03:32] Earth per se the framework is
[1:03:37] right but the earrings and the whatever
[1:03:38] he did at 20 and whatever you did at 20
[1:03:40] years old that's not what God saw
[1:03:43] remember brother Brown said if God sees
[1:03:45] you without the blood he's got to kill
[1:03:48] you
[1:03:49] Christian or not because this right here
[1:03:52] can't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:03:54] flesh and blood as we speak now
[1:03:58] cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:04:01] it's got to be changed it's got to be
[1:04:03] made new it's got to be an I create a
[1:04:05] new Heaven and a new Earth it's going to
[1:04:07] be the same framework let's read this
[1:04:09] right here
[1:04:11] at the end time 1954. I picked these up
[1:04:14] because this is where brother round said
[1:04:16] we don't have to read Genesis one do we
[1:04:18] have to read Genesis 1 26 again
[1:04:20] we've read it enough we were made in
[1:04:22] God's image right
[1:04:24] oh I'm so glad
[1:04:26] to be on earth now
[1:04:28] this is the prophet just before the
[1:04:31] break of day
[1:04:32] heard the message of his blessed
[1:04:33] appearing lo and behold the Fig leaves
[1:04:36] now are becoming green
[1:04:37] this is 1954.
[1:04:39] how many years ago that 60.
[1:04:48] well I'm glad to be on earth now just
[1:04:50] before the break of day Herald the
[1:04:52] message of his blessed appearing lo and
[1:04:55] behold the Fig leaves now are becoming
[1:04:56] green the gospel of the kingdom is
[1:04:58] sweeping to every nation and we're near
[1:05:00] the end can you and the end can be seen
[1:05:02] amen our heavenly father as we bow in
[1:05:05] thy presence to thank thee for Jesus thy
[1:05:07] beloved Son who gave his life a ransom
[1:05:09] for us coming down and saving us from a
[1:05:12] life of sin that he might resurrect us
[1:05:14] in a new body
[1:05:17] at that great day restore now remember
[1:05:20] when he put that word restore in and see
[1:05:21] it brings that new right back
[1:05:23] everybody got that when he says restore
[1:05:26] because because you can't if you take
[1:05:28] this and throw it away and pick up this
[1:05:30] that's not restoring this back
[1:05:32] this is what fell
[1:05:35] this is not restoring it back so you're
[1:05:37] not getting a new body you're getting
[1:05:38] the same framework
[1:05:41] not exactly the same gases doesn't have
[1:05:43] to be 16 elements of the earth your
[1:05:46] image
[1:05:47] of what God saw
[1:05:49] right
[1:05:51] everybody okay with this they really
[1:05:53] enjoyed it in Sunday school class I
[1:05:54] don't know where it came from either
[1:05:55] because it sure didn't have nothing to
[1:05:56] do with patience
[1:05:59] maybe it did
[1:06:01] restore us back to Perfection
[1:06:06] because we got a match
[1:06:08] the word here
[1:06:10] we know what the word is there it can't
[1:06:12] change Genesis 1 26 man cannot change it
[1:06:15] never has changed never will change
[1:06:18] it's a paradox
[1:06:20] you're sitting here all of us are most
[1:06:23] of us are over 20
[1:06:25] some of us three times that some of us
[1:06:28] close to four times that
[1:06:32] but yet if you're born again
[1:06:36] you're 20 years old
[1:06:39] it's hard to see
[1:06:41] but I believe that's what's going to
[1:06:43] help us in the change we got to see that
[1:06:45] that thing is already here it's not
[1:06:47] something we got to go get
[1:06:49] sin denominational World they got to go
[1:06:51] get some
[1:06:52] I'm sorry to say about denominational
[1:06:53] and most of the message people
[1:06:55] believe that you're going to throw like
[1:06:57] right here it says he says oh now
[1:06:58] brother Brown said a new body
[1:07:00] but keep reading restore us back
[1:07:05] he should have said annihilate us and
[1:07:07] get rid of this one and bring another
[1:07:09] one
[1:07:10] no it's not what he said
[1:07:13] now let's look at Fellowship 1955.
[1:07:16] now if you speak of heaven or when we
[1:07:17] die that we go off to a place somewhere
[1:07:20] where you can't even see up there can't
[1:07:23] you see that God has hid the glory from
[1:07:25] the Natural Life
[1:07:26] we are sitting here in Heavenly places
[1:07:28] now the holy spirit is here now Christ
[1:07:30] is here and the body that we receive
[1:07:33] when we go out of here we go into
[1:07:36] another dimension
[1:07:38] into a blessed place with the Lord Jesus
[1:07:41] said at the returning of Christ in his
[1:07:42] physical body come back to earth he
[1:07:46] spiritually turned back and picked up a
[1:07:48] brand new body
[1:07:50] what sounds like it's going to be brand
[1:07:52] new
[1:07:53] still same framework though right
[1:07:56] right still the same you right
[1:08:00] picked up a brand new body that's going
[1:08:02] to live forever
[1:08:05] oh my people could get the idea right
[1:08:07] now the Angels walking up and down these
[1:08:09] aisles of Christ the son of God moving
[1:08:10] around in the building what a difference
[1:08:12] you're in his presence
[1:08:14] I don't believe that's any different
[1:08:15] than now
[1:08:16] questions and answers 1959 what
[1:08:19] difference is between Body Soul and
[1:08:21] Spirit now I'm going to read this one
[1:08:22] and then we'll be finished
[1:08:24] and I'll be do what my Deacon said be
[1:08:26] done by 8 30.
[1:08:28] ain't that wonderful
[1:08:29] the body is the flesh that you look at
[1:08:31] that must rot
[1:08:33] it was born by sexual desire of father
[1:08:36] and mother
[1:08:37] it must rot it is no good
[1:08:40] therefore in the new birth in the
[1:08:42] resurrection when you're brought forth
[1:08:43] again in a new body
[1:08:46] okay everybody all right with that one
[1:08:47] now when brother Brown says new or
[1:08:49] somebody says new
[1:08:51] okay it'll be God's creative power
[1:08:54] that'll speak like he did to Adam and
[1:08:57] you'll come forth see because remember I
[1:08:59] want to you know we always use
[1:09:01] um Abraham and Sarah as a type changing
[1:09:04] back these bodies but remember God
[1:09:06] changed Sarah's body back but he had to
[1:09:08] do something else to her
[1:09:11] so he didn't just change her back to the
[1:09:13] 20 year old girl she was
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:18] because she couldn't bear kids
[1:09:21] right so he must have had to change
[1:09:23] something else so it wasn't just this
[1:09:25] right here got changed back no God did a
[1:09:28] work
[1:09:29] right in that body
[1:09:31] to bring her back
[1:09:33] see so that's why we need to just watch
[1:09:36] what we're watch what we're doing
[1:09:37] all right look
[1:09:39] adoption I like this one
[1:09:42] then we'll go back to the 64 questions
[1:09:44] and answers and what is it when you're
[1:09:45] way out
[1:09:46] fishing with a brand new body
[1:09:49] you've turned back to a young man all
[1:09:51] together again or a young woman you're
[1:09:53] never going to die no more and you look
[1:09:55] down on Earth and think I can enjoy some
[1:09:57] grapes and some good cold water but you
[1:09:59] know I don't need it here
[1:10:01] see that's when they're over in the
[1:10:02] sixth dimension
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:06] right that's what he's talking about
[1:10:09] but someday Jesus is coming and this
[1:10:11] Angelic body this theophany that I'm
[1:10:13] living in will not come through the womb
[1:10:16] of a woman anymore it'll not come
[1:10:18] through sexual desire anymore but
[1:10:20] because that he was born without sex
[1:10:22] desire I'll be resurrected without it
[1:10:26] and he will speak someday and the dead
[1:10:28] in Christ shall rise and that body that
[1:10:31] I once lived in
[1:10:34] huh he's pretty playing here right right
[1:10:38] same framework
[1:10:40] I once lived in will resurrect into a
[1:10:43] glorified body amen so a change
[1:10:46] and I walk I'll talk I'll live I'll
[1:10:49] enjoy Hallelujah and they must be
[1:10:51] rejoicing because you can't understand
[1:10:52] what he's saying the ages to come
[1:10:54] through Jesus Christ Our Lord there you
[1:10:56] are brother that's the gospel all right
[1:10:58] questions and answers 1964.
[1:11:02] now listen to this this is the last one
[1:11:05] this first conscience controls this body
[1:11:07] with sea taste fill smelling here
[1:11:09] everybody understands you got three
[1:11:11] different aspects of your body you got
[1:11:13] body which is flesh
[1:11:16] spirit and soul
[1:11:18] okay you got a body which is this man C
[1:11:23] taste
[1:11:25] feel smell and hear that's what this
[1:11:28] body was given to us for it to contact
[1:11:30] this Earth that's why it's down here on
[1:11:31] this Earth in flesh okay then we got a
[1:11:33] spirit that has memory reason conscious
[1:11:36] affection imagination all right you got
[1:11:38] that then inside that is a soul that's
[1:11:41] either Faith or doubt you either have
[1:11:42] God in you tonight or you have the devil
[1:11:47] now God works
[1:11:49] from the outside in to get you born
[1:11:52] again
[1:11:53] then he works from the inside out to
[1:11:56] redeem this guy yeah this guy
[1:11:59] okay right
[1:12:01] so you understand that you got to go
[1:12:03] through justification outer Court
[1:12:05] sanctification the spirit realm
[1:12:07] intercourt inside and the holy of holies
[1:12:09] is where nobody can get to because
[1:12:11] nobody knows you but you
[1:12:13] that's right nobody
[1:12:15] nobody even your wife doesn't know you
[1:12:17] but you she can't think your thoughts
[1:12:20] thank God
[1:12:23] you can't think hers either thank God
[1:12:26] but you can be one
[1:12:28] but it's two people so she has a body
[1:12:31] spirit and soul you have a bodies
[1:12:32] everybody has a body spirit and soul
[1:12:34] even Jesus had a body spirit and soul
[1:12:35] amen all right but remember Jesus's
[1:12:38] Spirit was not
[1:12:41] Fallen because he was not brought by sex
[1:12:43] desire he was brought by creation all
[1:12:46] right this is for the new ones but I
[1:12:48] wanted to get this last quote in I got
[1:12:49] to bring this back out so you got sea
[1:12:52] taste feel smelling here and that's what
[1:12:54] animals have
[1:12:55] see taste feel smell in here so this is
[1:12:58] animal flesh this is what God give us to
[1:12:59] contact the world with same thing as the
[1:13:02] animals
[1:13:03] then there's a spirit in there memory
[1:13:05] reason conscious affection imagination
[1:13:07] now the dog can have a little bit of
[1:13:08] that or a cat but they can't love
[1:13:13] okay they can't have a soul they can't
[1:13:15] choose right or wrong
[1:13:19] right they don't have a soul they don't
[1:13:21] have a conscience
[1:13:22] to do that but you do
[1:13:25] right that's what we're talking about
[1:13:26] God works through justification
[1:13:28] what you do out here
[1:13:31] remember sanctification is what's inside
[1:13:33] cleans all that out all that unclean
[1:13:36] Spirit right
[1:13:37] then in the inside man it's either the
[1:13:40] Holy Spirit
[1:13:41] or Euro or your own nature or your new
[1:13:43] nature one of the two you know I've got
[1:13:45] two souls in there you're an individual
[1:13:47] you're one person you've got one soul
[1:13:49] that's soul by you being born into this
[1:13:52] world that Soul has a fallen nature
[1:13:54] because it was born in sin
[1:13:57] shaping and iniquity
[1:14:02] that's the pattern
[1:14:04] but see God knew though that if he puts
[1:14:07] you down here
[1:14:08] give you a soul to make a choice then
[1:14:11] you're going to turn around and make a
[1:14:13] choice
[1:14:14] that he already saw
[1:14:17] everybody all right that he already saw
[1:14:20] you're going to make that choice then he
[1:14:22] comes to that
[1:14:24] Burns that old nature out
[1:14:27] the things of the world the smoking the
[1:14:28] drinking all that should go out it's
[1:14:30] sanctification I'm talking about inside
[1:14:32] man wants to feed on the word
[1:14:35] he wants it more than anything he wants
[1:14:37] that word to be born down inside of him
[1:14:41] I don't understand a lot of people in
[1:14:43] the message you know they said boy quit
[1:14:44] smoking quit drink no just get born
[1:14:45] again like Dave said just get born again
[1:14:49] you'll quit that business
[1:14:52] what happened to me and that's what
[1:14:54] happened to Mo those of you that are
[1:14:55] born again know what I'm talking about
[1:14:59] but remember you still look like a
[1:15:01] cucumber
[1:15:03] right
[1:15:05] you still look like the old you
[1:15:08] the old you just doesn't do is went
[1:15:10] through a process a pickling process
[1:15:13] where you don't taste the things of the
[1:15:15] world anymore you don't want the things
[1:15:17] of the world anymore
[1:15:19] but you still are a human right
[1:15:22] still look like a cucumber but you went
[1:15:25] through the baptismal the pickling
[1:15:27] process where it has changed you all
[1:15:29] right that's where you talk about a new
[1:15:31] body well there it is the pickle the
[1:15:33] pickle is new it's got a whole new name
[1:15:35] doesn't it
[1:15:36] you don't go pick up some cucumbers
[1:15:39] and just assume they're pickles
[1:15:42] no you go to the grocery store and you
[1:15:43] get cucumbers over here then you go over
[1:15:46] here to the jar that says
[1:15:48] pickles
[1:15:50] but you know in the back of your mind
[1:15:52] that used to be a cucumber right
[1:15:57] and you get it over here
[1:15:59] right but it's been changed
[1:16:02] and you can't ever take that pickle
[1:16:05] and make it a cucumber anymore
[1:16:09] Hallelujah
[1:16:11] you'll never go back
[1:16:12] you may look like a pickle
[1:16:15] but you're not gonna act like a pickle I
[1:16:18] mean a cucumber You're Gonna Act Like a
[1:16:19] pickle you may look like the frame will
[1:16:21] be the same now look watch this right
[1:16:23] here this first conscious controls this
[1:16:25] body with sea taste feel smelling here
[1:16:28] and that's just got us all scrupled up
[1:16:31] we reason and everything else
[1:16:33] but that new body
[1:16:35] that comes from this born again
[1:16:38] not this first conscious it'll pass away
[1:16:42] everybody got that right this conscious
[1:16:44] will pass away all right
[1:16:47] it's that inside something that lives
[1:16:50] everybody understand it say Amen
[1:16:52] congregation says amen it's not this
[1:16:54] outside see taste feel smelling here let
[1:16:57] me stop here for a minute it that only
[1:16:59] reacts to what's inside right
[1:17:03] the Cucumber looks like a cucumber but
[1:17:05] when you bite into it the inside is a
[1:17:07] pickle
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:11] same way with God it looks like still
[1:17:13] this
[1:17:14] but when God comes inside it makes that
[1:17:17] cucumber
[1:17:18] act like a pickle
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:22] all right so it's come from this born
[1:17:24] again not this first conscious it'll
[1:17:25] pass away it's that inside something
[1:17:27] that lives it's not this outside sea
[1:17:30] taste feel smell and here it isn't it's
[1:17:32] subject to death and will die but the
[1:17:34] inside part of you down in here inside
[1:17:37] that is the person they calls it a
[1:17:39] person
[1:17:40] that is the person that cannot die amen
[1:17:45] amen see that's the person that the New
[1:17:48] Life Starts from
[1:17:51] can we interject Genesis 1 26 in there
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:55] so that's the new person
[1:17:58] and that's the person that the New Life
[1:18:00] Starts from from this new birth
[1:18:04] and it builds another person
[1:18:07] in the image of this person you are
[1:18:13] around that life
[1:18:14] you get it
[1:18:17] so potentially it's in here
[1:18:21] and what is it
[1:18:23] the word promised before the foundation
[1:18:28] of the world right
[1:18:30] the family album
[1:18:32] Genesis 1 26. God's preserved you he's
[1:18:35] put you up
[1:18:37] and around there this only reflects the
[1:18:40] negative that will reflect the positive
[1:18:44] the word
[1:18:46] see and the same thing is or the
[1:18:48] translation of the Bride will be the
[1:18:50] same thing the word that's in you the
[1:18:54] body will materialize around that word
[1:19:00] because this is not a word body
[1:19:02] remember we go back to who is this
[1:19:04] Melchizedek he says you didn't come word
[1:19:05] first
[1:19:06] you become the word
[1:19:09] that's why I don't understand these
[1:19:10] preachers the message think we come here
[1:19:12] with eternal life if you come here with
[1:19:13] eternal life you come here with the word
[1:19:14] right and you don't need a new birth
[1:19:18] but I need a new birth because I didn't
[1:19:20] come here with eternal life I don't care
[1:19:22] what anybody said
[1:19:24] I know what I did and that wasn't
[1:19:26] nothing to do with God right
[1:19:30] right the word that's in you the body
[1:19:32] will materialize around that word
[1:19:35] and the same thing did by Sarah when
[1:19:38] that old body that she had that first
[1:19:39] body it had to be changed in order to
[1:19:41] produce a son you get it that body could
[1:19:44] not do it this body cannot do it so
[1:19:48] it'll have to be changed the same way to
[1:19:51] receive the Sun
[1:19:55] all this done
[1:19:58] was just talking strong God's plan out
[1:20:00] just a little bit longer now listen
[1:20:02] didn't it didn't bother him because he
[1:20:04] ain't any longer than he was when he
[1:20:05] spoke it
[1:20:07] he ain't any older than when he spoke
[1:20:09] that's what I was telling him downstairs
[1:20:10] I said uh how many of you seen pictures
[1:20:14] of the world where they they draw a
[1:20:15] picture of God what does he look like
[1:20:17] does anybody ever seen a picture of God
[1:20:18] that looked like about his 20 year old
[1:20:20] man in the prime of his time and
[1:20:22] how do they picture God
[1:20:25] oh man gray-headed sorry I am too stoop
[1:20:29] shouldered
[1:20:30] Jen brought a book home from when she
[1:20:32] was going to the Baptist church and they
[1:20:33] were going through this wonderful and
[1:20:35] I'm not throwing off them but they they
[1:20:37] brought this wonderful subject of
[1:20:38] Experiencing God and she brought me the
[1:20:41] he said Experiencing God the man that
[1:20:43] lucky is 150 years old he was stooped
[1:20:47] over and had it didn't he had a cane he
[1:20:49] was stooped over and looking like this
[1:20:50] now I don't want a God Like That
[1:20:53] if I Made In His Image I don't want to
[1:20:56] be in that image
[1:20:58] right he's a 20 year old man when he
[1:21:00] looked at Adam
[1:21:02] when he looked at Adam Adam said hi Dad
[1:21:05] but they were the same age
[1:21:10] God wasn't 40 and Adam 20.
[1:21:13] they were both 20.
[1:21:15] they were both in the prime that's one
[1:21:17] of it when we see that when we see that
[1:21:19] when when Jesus came back in his
[1:21:22] glorified body
[1:21:24] that Mary May doing had a problem
[1:21:28] they say you got to watch that too
[1:21:30] because remember Jesus's body three days
[1:21:32] before that was beat so much so you
[1:21:36] couldn't tell who he was
[1:21:38] the canine Tails ripped flesh out he had
[1:21:41] stripes on his back he had bruises they
[1:21:43] pulled his beard out now when he
[1:21:45] resurrected
[1:21:47] that body didn't come up
[1:21:50] you understand what I'm saying that body
[1:21:52] that went down like that didn't come up
[1:21:56] that body changed
[1:21:59] that framework changed because I'll
[1:22:01] promise you remember brother Brown said
[1:22:03] it's not the it's not the chemistry of
[1:22:05] the blood Jesus's blood dripped on this
[1:22:08] Earth
[1:22:09] he didn't have any bud Lottery left in
[1:22:11] his own body
[1:22:13] but now I'm just you know I believe he
[1:22:16] shed the blood on the earth and left it
[1:22:17] here
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:23] so when he comes back and talks to Mary
[1:22:25] Magdalene he's went through a change
[1:22:28] same framework bruises are gone
[1:22:32] flesh is not torn but he's got the nail
[1:22:35] prints because of the Redemption Factor
[1:22:37] he showed he died
[1:22:39] and they weren't putrid Shores they were
[1:22:42] there they were holes because remember
[1:22:43] Thomas put his hand in his side
[1:22:46] he didn't just touch it he put his hand
[1:22:48] inside but remember they thought he was
[1:22:50] a spook
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:53] he said give me something to eat
[1:22:56] he ate it
[1:22:58] didn't fall in the floor
[1:23:01] it went somewhere
[1:23:03] it went into that body
[1:23:06] just like we'll eat forever
[1:23:08] and not need the things of the world
[1:23:11] and we'll eat because we enjoy eating
[1:23:13] right
[1:23:14] right amen
[1:23:15] well I figured I'd got more praise God
[1:23:18] than that but
[1:23:20] you know what
[1:23:22] didn't brother Brown say that God will
[1:23:24] give you the desire of your heart
[1:23:27] I like to eat too
[1:23:29] if my desires to eat that's not going to
[1:23:31] go away over there
[1:23:32] I'm gonna sit down and eat we're just
[1:23:34] going to be glad that it multiplies real
[1:23:36] fast
[1:23:37] you understand
[1:23:39] but do you see what I'm saying this this
[1:23:41] Earth is going to go through a process
[1:23:43] but your body right now God's going to
[1:23:46] come down and the ones that take the
[1:23:48] body change
[1:23:49] you're going to be changed in your very
[1:23:51] atoms
[1:23:52] because our atoms are deteriorating
[1:23:54] right now
[1:23:56] we're blowing out gases and I'm not
[1:23:59] trying to be funny but we are as human
[1:24:02] beings we're given off
[1:24:04] gas stuff because we're dying it's
[1:24:07] corrupt that's why he was they wouldn't
[1:24:09] let Jesus's body because we got to have
[1:24:10] a body like his glorious body
[1:24:12] remember he said I won't leave my holy
[1:24:14] one seed corruption corruption is the
[1:24:16] breaking down of gases
[1:24:18] Jesus's body wasn't that way because
[1:24:19] we're going to have one like his we're
[1:24:21] gonna have a body like his glorious body
[1:24:23] and when he came up in that Resurrection
[1:24:25] the only Marx he had was a March you and
[1:24:27] I put on him right
[1:24:30] I thank God that he's going to let us
[1:24:32] live for an eternity
[1:24:34] like brother Danny he could left brother
[1:24:36] Danny like that there's your marks of
[1:24:39] Shame there's your marks of sin any of
[1:24:41] us there's your whatever your mark is
[1:24:44] your you know you're taken out of
[1:24:46] something or or your hair or tattoos but
[1:24:49] you know what he's going to do he's
[1:24:50] going to wipe that all away
[1:24:53] he's going to take you and put you in
[1:24:55] your Perfection but yet he's going to
[1:24:56] walk through Glory
[1:24:59] and still show the marks
[1:25:02] I've always said he's going to have a
[1:25:05] marked body for eternity
[1:25:08] just so you can have a perfect one
[1:25:11] just so you can have a perfect body
[1:25:14] he's going to stand there and he's going
[1:25:16] to prove to everybody that he paid
[1:25:23] he didn't know
[1:25:25] let's sing that song Let's stand
[1:25:27] he paid again he did not oh I owed a
[1:25:33] death I could not pay I needed someone
[1:25:38] to wash my sins away
[1:25:43] and now I sing a brand new song Amazing
[1:25:48] Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a
[1:25:54] dead that I could never pay
[1:25:58] he paid again a Cavalry he cleansed my
[1:26:04] soul and set me free I'm glad that Jesus
[1:26:09] cause we couldn't do it
[1:26:11] in our sin we couldn't do that
[1:26:14] but he was a silliest one no brand new
[1:26:18] song Amazing Grace all day long Christ
[1:26:24] Jesus
[1:26:29] not just gonna stay up there one day
[1:26:32] he's coming back for me chilling with
[1:26:37] him
[1:26:38] eternally only being glory to see him on
[1:26:44] that day
[1:26:47] I think we'll sing I'll bring you song
[1:26:51] Amazing Grace all day long crashes Jesus
[1:27:00] say it again
[1:27:09] I could not pay I needed someone to wash
[1:27:15] my sins away we were trapped down here
[1:27:31] it couldn't be a spirit it had to be a
[1:27:34] man a human a cancer
[1:27:37] oh every time you think of Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] it ought to make you just be free
[1:27:47] millions of people in this world
[1:27:50] Glory
[1:28:17] to see him on that day oh it won't be
[1:28:21] quiet that's for sure
[1:28:37] he gave us something new how many of you
[1:28:41] when you get something new
[1:28:43] man you know I'm a Dave Ramsey fan so I
[1:28:46] don't buy new cars but new cars have a
[1:28:48] good smell to them everybody likes to
[1:28:50] have a new car smell
[1:28:52] you know
[1:28:54] what Jesus Christ done for us
[1:28:57] is 10 billion trillion zillion times
[1:28:59] better than any
[1:29:01] thinking new car smell
[1:29:05] he gave you something new
[1:29:07] your mom and daddy couldn't give you
[1:29:09] anything but a life here
[1:29:11] but God so loved you and so saw that you
[1:29:14] would so want him
[1:29:17] he took somebody from California and
[1:29:20] somebody from Georgia that there's no
[1:29:22] way they should have ever met
[1:29:24] no way
[1:29:26] they put them together
[1:29:31] Gary
[1:29:32] look at your family
[1:29:36] Why'd You Come the way you did
[1:29:39] God knew it
[1:29:40] and he preserved that whole line
[1:29:43] he brought that whole line down because
[1:29:44] you know what if you're if one of your
[1:29:46] fathers would have died if your
[1:29:48] great-great-grandfather would have died
[1:29:51] anybody in your line listen this is how
[1:29:54] perfect this is anybody in your line
[1:29:56] from the foundation of the world died
[1:29:59] you wouldn't be here right
[1:30:01] right but God so preserved all the way
[1:30:03] from the foundation of the world
[1:30:06] Mr Gale
[1:30:08] you are important
[1:30:10] you're important to God
[1:30:12] he changed everything to get you here
[1:30:16] and then you know what he'll leave you
[1:30:18] this way he's going to change you right
[1:30:20] back right
[1:30:21] right because you're going to be made in
[1:30:22] the image
[1:30:23] of what he saw before the foundation of
[1:30:26] the world
[1:30:27] so you don't have to exactly get your
[1:30:29] picture out one day and say boy that's
[1:30:31] what I'm going to look like I'm going to
[1:30:32] be
[1:30:34] but I got short hair and I got earrings
[1:30:36] I got makeup on I got pritches on for
[1:30:40] the women man I got on shorts I got hair
[1:30:42] down to my navel yeah Gary and I got a
[1:30:46] beer in my hand you know Gary yeah
[1:30:49] can I tell them some yeah we're at his
[1:30:52] birthday party and they were putting up
[1:30:54] some of his old pictures and you saw
[1:30:55] some of mine when we did June's uh
[1:30:57] collages for her birthday you saw some
[1:30:59] of my legs but Gary a lot of pictures
[1:31:03] there's Gary and he's got a beer in his
[1:31:05] hand well that was about the 20 year old
[1:31:07] that looked that right on it now that's
[1:31:09] not the that's not the guy that God saw
[1:31:12] is everybody okay with that you see what
[1:31:14] I'm trying to explain that's not the guy
[1:31:15] that God saw
[1:31:17] God saw that 20 year old man
[1:31:20] in his prime
[1:31:22] doesn't matter how old he gets down here
[1:31:25] he's not coming back to the beer
[1:31:27] drinking hippie right
[1:31:29] right bro Gary it's not coming back to
[1:31:31] that you know what the desire of this
[1:31:33] man is not to go back to that your
[1:31:36] desire should not be that you go back to
[1:31:37] the 20 year old man you were walking on
[1:31:39] this Earth with are women
[1:31:41] you should not right
[1:31:43] any of us I mean as holy as any of us
[1:31:45] might have been at 20 years old I still
[1:31:47] don't want to be that
[1:31:49] I want to be born In His Image the one
[1:31:51] that he saw
[1:31:52] and then when I see my reflection you
[1:31:55] know what I do I just open up every once
[1:31:57] in a while I get the family album out
[1:32:00] and I flipped it right open and says
[1:32:02] there's therefore now no condemnation
[1:32:05] to them which are in
[1:32:07] Christ Jesus who walked not after the
[1:32:10] flesh
[1:32:11] but after the spirit
[1:32:13] there's therefore now no condemnation
[1:32:15] how many of you got condemned today
[1:32:18] come on
[1:32:20] okay all right so what's he talking
[1:32:23] about
[1:32:24] listen to this there's therefore now no
[1:32:26] condemnation to them which are in
[1:32:27] Genesis 1 26 man yeah
[1:32:29] who walked not after the 2-7 man
[1:32:32] but after the 126 man
[1:32:35] because that's what God's looking at and
[1:32:37] when we match that according to the word
[1:32:39] now it's not going to be that we match
[1:32:40] that Samuel Dale at 74 years old
[1:32:43] but when the word matches
[1:32:45] that word that he is when that matches
[1:32:48] it's got to come right right they got to
[1:32:51] come together
[1:32:53] they can't it's Eternal so it's got to
[1:32:55] come together
[1:32:56] you love the Lord everybody all right
[1:32:59] man we did good tonight I think we
[1:33:01] learned male learned a little bit we
[1:33:02] we're we're not let's just don't be
[1:33:05] dogmatic
[1:33:06] Maybe
[1:33:08] say it again
[1:33:13] no that's like me and brother Bob and
[1:33:15] said that's the difference because this
[1:33:16] is eternal there's nothing dogmatic
[1:33:18] about eternal
[1:33:20] there's nothing dogmatic about the word
[1:33:22] of God it's the real thing remember the
[1:33:25] dogmatic said it was your opinion
[1:33:28] right it said your opinion of what you
[1:33:31] thought was real this is not what
[1:33:33] tonight this wasn't my opinion what I
[1:33:34] thought was real I brought it from the
[1:33:36] word and I brought it from The Prophet's
[1:33:37] message so it was eternal
[1:33:39] so
[1:33:41] I'm going to quit saying dogmatic
[1:33:42] because it comes from Dogma
[1:33:45] but we are sure about the word of God
[1:33:48] Amen Jesus was sure of who he was
[1:33:51] because he knew who he was
[1:33:53] I want to I want to bring a sermon about
[1:33:55] the anointing because Jesus the greatest
[1:33:57] anointing on the in the whole world
[1:33:59] brother Brown said it wasn't when Holy
[1:34:01] Ghost fell into that Pentecost
[1:34:04] it's not what he said
[1:34:05] brother Brown said the greatest
[1:34:06] anointing was when Jesus Took the Bible
[1:34:09] Scrolls set down
[1:34:12] and read them right
[1:34:15] and the Bible said he closed the book
[1:34:17] set down in Precious words proceeded
[1:34:19] from his mouth
[1:34:21] that was the greatest anointing the
[1:34:23] prophet said that ever struck the Earth
[1:34:25] you know what I believe it was it was a
[1:34:27] man
[1:34:29] identifying himself in the word right
[1:34:31] right if a man can identify himself in
[1:34:34] the word that's the greatest anointing
[1:34:35] because that's what's going to change
[1:34:37] our bodies brother it ain't going to be
[1:34:39] this we're not going to it's not going
[1:34:40] to be a great glorious shouting and
[1:34:42] running around you know that was all
[1:34:43] Pentecostal and good and that's okay if
[1:34:45] we still want to do it right
[1:34:47] but that's not going to bring about the
[1:34:49] anointing to get us out of here
[1:34:52] because that's happened down through
[1:34:53] time the greatest anointing is is to
[1:34:55] identify yourself in the word
[1:34:58] then let that body build inside
[1:35:02] what did he just say build around
[1:35:05] that Born Again experience built around
[1:35:07] that built on that's what we're doing
[1:35:08] downstairs in the Statue of a perfect
[1:35:10] man we're building on the new birth
[1:35:12] we're not building the new birth
[1:35:15] we're building on the new birth because
[1:35:17] the new birth is Faith so we're building
[1:35:19] on the new birth exactly Being Born
