more than 5 minutes if you don't get it all done so there's about 13 separate kits that we're buying so 13 people not 13 people but 13 couples plus you know some that are um that are single are going to take it so it may take a little bit of time and we may do some next Sunday but it's really important that you sign up and even June can get you the information on how to do it at home but we will start not this coming Sunday brother Tom Ern to be with us but we'll start the next one August the 5th at 5:00 so those of you who have not signed up please do if you want to take the course um I'm I'm just really anticipating this one because we have to open it to the we have to open it to everybody because of copyright infringements if we were to close it to just this church we would have to fill out a whole bunch of forms copyright forms and I don't know about paying a fee but if we'll leave it open to anybody and everybody but if somebody wants to come to this church if 5:00 on Sunday afternoon they're welcome to come all right so we've left it open but uh we are compiling there's over 800 scriptures in the Bible about how we handle money and there's about 250 quotes from The Prophet about money debt and investment the Prophet The Prophet talked about money you need anything go to the put put money in put debt in put something in and I'll promise you our Prophet covered it pretty well so just keep that in your mind also brother jul for will be here Wednesday looking forward to that and then next Sunday brother Tom Ernest and then you heard all the other ones will'll be announcing them along the way the brother that was here this morning he is from Delaware and I think his name is Brother Don or Dan Roberts and he is looking you need to keep him in your prayers he flew down here today or yesterday his wife found us on the internet told her told him to come here and he found the church and then tomorrow he's going for an interview now this afternoon he's going to look at houses so he's looking for an interview to move from Delaware to Georgia that's a good move I don't care if you come here with no job so no offense that's a good move anyway so but pray for him he has a job interview tomorrow a job interview tomorrow uh you know I told him I said brother I'm not going to tell you good luck cuz I don't believe in luck I believe in prayer all right I believe you make your own luck that's right all right so he's come down here though sincerely looking for a job in Norcross some kind of technical job that he does in Delaware but he's looking to relocate down here so let's just pray that that the Lord will open that up and he'll find him a place to stay and he'll find him a u a good job and find him a good church and he really enjoyed this morning and asked Dad for the tape so he's going to take it back I do not remember his pastor's name it's somebody in Hershey Pennsylvania but I I can't remember it starts with an F but it doesn't come to me but I I had never heard of him before but he is a message believer so he wasn't in the wrong place right A lot of times we have people come in and sit down that they know in a few minutes they're in the wrong place and they ease up and go back out to that church over there so U but he was a me he is a message believer so just keep him in your prayers and his wife may be watching in now so the Lord bless each and every one of you but let's turn to Revelations 20 and we're going to take a side a dig a little bit deeper in what brother Dale been speaking on as far as the book and we're going to title this today the book of books that book in Revelation 5 is not just a book of life of every person right right God didn't redeem every person that's right judas's name is not in that book that's right that book the one in Revelation 5 it's not in that book all right but we're going to read I'm going to break down the books for you show you how many they are and sections in them and I got a Little Help From My Buddy out in Oklahoma brother Claud may be listening bless his heart I love you but he U he gave me a few thoughts and ideas on on how to present this and and I really appreciate the support we need support we don't just get this you know from reading a a Sports magazine you know I mean we we we see these things and we listen and Faith does come by hearing it does not come by preaching it comes by hearing so we have to hear the word of God just like you do all right Revelations 20:2 let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray today Lord that you would stop time father that we get a point across that needs to be gotten across and that we'll all listen Lord and be attentative that you'll come down Lord among us and Quicken our hearts and our minds and and keep us Lord with our Focus straight on you father not on being sleepy or what we ate or what we're doing tomorrow or or what time we're going to leave or or any of the cares of life life let's just be shut in with God in a secret place today let's just take you father and and and let you do the work let you be the one that does the speaking you be the one that has the preeminence also in the hearer and Lord in the speaker father we pray now that you just heal the sick and Afflicted you said you sent the word and heal them and deliver them from destruction bless brother Joe Lord as he called yesterday and said they'd be listening in or watching in today Lord just be with him and his family be with him in his move for to his new home Brother Gary cramp Lord just be with him father and raise him up for your honor and glory and make him feel better Lord than he's ever felt before we know you're a God that just you don't just patch things up you totally restore all things father we pray now that you'd be with the ones that are not with us Lord that you'll take care of them wherever they are on the highways just bless them Lord may they manifest you in their own way father we pray that you just be with the foreign missionaries be with them Lord and we know that the missionaries are now coming on making their way over to here for the camp meeting Lord we ask that you just give Lord safe passage and safe journey to each one father and may they bring us something Lord a a testimony of of what's happening in the foreign countries and then bring us a word of God we pray now that you just bless take care of us forgive us of our sins Lord cuz there are many are many mistakes we make in this old flesh father we ask you to forgive us father until the day that we can look at you face to face Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen Revelations 20: 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now keep that in your mind and the Sea gave up the dead which were in and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works that's the second time that said that and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast in to the Lake of Fire now let's go to job 19: 23 job cries out oh that my words were now written all that they were printed in a book you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word now let's get started we got a long way to go go short time to get there pull up the next one here are this I want you to keep this in mind cuz we're going to use this later on this is the strongs number 975 this is most of your new testament definition of a scroll now look what it is a small book a scroll a written document a sheet on which something has been written all right go to the next one strongs number 1697 in the Bible this is what it says about a book it's called a speech word speaking it's actually a thing speech or saying or utterance you see the other ones but let's use you the ones for emphasis all right let's go to the next one PM number 5612 look what this one says now this is in the all in the Old Testament all right this was in the Hebrew number 5612 anywhere you see it in the Old Testament it pretty much means a legal document certificate of divorce are a deed of purchase right a deed of purchase what are we talking about today Redemption we're trying to we're getting back to that book in Revelations 5 which is a deed of purchase or an indictment or a sign it's also a book or a scroll all right now what is this book it's a book of names and actions tied to those names right everybody understand amen right it's a not just a book of names right because you're not just identifyed when you say you're a person's name there's an identity there there's a there's a there's a definition an action what that person's known by right everybody's known by a different name but but I can call I don't want to call somebody's name but call my name I am definitely not shy I am not quiet okay well then what are you laughing for CU this what what that's what does not identify who I am but the other part identifies who me there's the book it's not just a book of names that's right it's a book of their actions and the motivations in your life because remember how many of you heard this your life is like an open right or I can read you like a b well what does that mean we're not talking about a book that you open up no your life is an open book a testimony a memorial or a manifestation right that's why Paul had to be changed from Saul to Paul the manifestation of Saul was an arrogant King back in the Old Testament that wouldn't fit Paul's character after he's born again all right now you and I the same way and we'll read in invisible Union a little bit later and prove some of that but see that is your there's not there there's not a book in the Bible that is recording a book of names of animals or of trees or of churches or benches you understand what I'm saying yes it's a book of human life right Souls right anything that's got a Soul's got a book attached to it right written Epistles right right amen that's right we're going to look and see where brother random said there was one group that's not aen above their life is recorded but they're not even included in this book that we're talking about right right and I want you to take this and put it in your cap for about an hour from now in Revelations 20 you're not in any of those books right if you're born again that's right it says book and it says books you're not included in that that's right right so that's why I want to call this sermon today the book of books the book of books may I I say the sublime book of books right amen so that book that that lamb took was not just a book of life right it was not special group of people Glory now listen let's go to Hebrews 10:7 then said I lo I come into the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God now what scripture is this body thou Hast prepared me what is is the Lord Jesus so the book is a person right right l i personal pronoun I come right parentheses to make to make it to make it what it's supposed to be in the volume of the book it is written of me making emphasis of where it's coming from right right in the volume of my life it is written of me to do what he was very specific to do thy will oh God right so that book is a person right Glory it's not just a piece of paper right it's a book of human life Souls also the book is a word judgment comes from the book right right right but there's only one book amen because I just said the book is a word right yes yeah if you got two books you got two words M thought of that right you got two books you got two words you can't be judged that's being double minded God's not double minded he's got one book that's right that you going to be judged out of not two books but there just as there are the Bible with 66 chapters in The Bible but that's one book right there's 66 sections that make up that bible all right there's sections we're going to break those sections down real quick and then we're going to get to what we want to read but if you got two books remember that you got two words that's right but now this book has several sections right I read the Bible a siner reads the Bible right somebody with not the without the Holy Ghost reads the Bible mhm they don't get the same understanding that's it's the same words that's right right it's not changing anything that's you read when you were Baptist or whatever you where you read baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost you put your stamp on it that's the way you read it that's right that's not what it said no but that's what you read right now let's get into the book let's go to the first quote I brought some I told them I only had six quotes but one of them is about four pages long so I tricked them a little bit in the sardian church age Church a book chapter 7 we're going to let brother random explain about the book now let's run back let's don't go to Revelations 5 come back and let's explain Revelations 20 about the books all right and where people go and what happens to them because it's going to help you in Revelation 5 when we get back to it about 6:00 this afternoon at the very start of our study nobody left at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names God does not have to sit down and and physically write down no when he thought it that was it this was done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly also it is not a question of Simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had opportunity to receive eternal life where one group received it and had their names placed on the record while the other ones who refused it did not have their Nam so placed right we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who were not even born again listen to this read that we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who were not even born again will go into eternal life amen right more than it's going to be in the city he going to be outside that city as strange as this may sound it is certainly true we will also show that there's a group of people whose names have been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstance right exactly amen for predestination amen cannot under any circumstance have those names removed but will also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed right now let us go another step but first let's review our case all right he's going to review the case here and then I'm going to break it down for you let the prophet say it then we're going to back up up and show the sections cuz really there's four sections to the book which prop said what right now let's go another step but before we do let's review our case thus far first of all first we know that most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was Pur purp in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride amen she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him remember that sermon she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation we're going to get into that in a little while she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her right amen Romans 4:8 blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment right so that book basically disappears right as far as a remembrance in books that's why I say in Revelation 20 really this first one is not in there it's not we're not judged by the time we get to Revelations 20 we're doing the judging we're not judged we're doing the judging all right so so our book is s here they're actually looking at us right being judged from the Eternal section of the book amen all right so now secondly all right I'm sorry but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's number one number two secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25 remember the wise virgin and the foolish virgin in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast are become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride right when we go up persecution starts in the foolish virgins over here the ones that are not born again all right everybody understand that say Amen in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life amen everybody got that all right thirdly there are the borderline Christians such as we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these had their names in The Book of Life and their words written in the books keep that word work we're going to get to something these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit though even listen though even even the signs and wonders were amongst them right will have their names removed from The Book of Life amongst this group will be the ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit entirely void of the spirit right right huh yes but our religious will have manifestations in their lives I telling them downstairs and I'm telling you again do not ever base your Christian experience on whether God answers your prayers or not that's right or whether you're successful or not God can heal a prosecute right don't ever I never have I love it when God answers my prayer but I don't I don't put that as a well I know God's with me well I know I'm a Son of God oh sure he he'll answer a son's prayer but he'll also answer a prostitute's prayer right that's right the Bible doesn't stipulate he said if you'll pay your tithe I'll pour out the windows of Heaven he didn't say just because you're my children right no cuz that's what that prostitute does there's no way her filthy life her filthy life cannot do anything but put her in hell but she can walk before somebody and somebody can reach their hand and say sister buy his stripes you're healed and if she would go I believe what that man says God to heal her of anything she's got but the tomorrow she may have five Johns out there that she's working for so don't ever base your Christian experience on that God answers your prayer that's right amen I said don't B it it's good that it happen but don't put it and say this is why cuz I'm going to tell you something God answered judas's prayer heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils huh among this group will be one like Judas who though entirely bored of the spirit but are religious will have manifestations in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him amen that's right I'm prove that to you in just a little while such also are BM will be in that group fourth and finally there's your four groups are the ones whose names have never been or never or ever will be written on the books such as are found in Revelations 138 Revelation 178 all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend to the bottom of his pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall Wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is in other words ones that take the mark of the beast and never is any kind of religious order all right Jesus said that a certain group would accept one who came in his own name that one is the Antichrist and that is exactly what it says of them in Revelations 138 and 178 kind of strange how 138 and Hebrews 138 kind of coincide there Jesus Christ say yesterday day and forever all that go on Earth shall worship the other guy whose name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life that's right all right these were ordained of God but not into election and this group is such that are as Pharaoh then he said to him in other words he raises up people see even for this purpose have I raised thee up vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction Romans 91722 none of these would be placed on the records of life right I am not saying there is no record of them right MH cuz a record is a person we just prove that right a record is the words you bear or the manifestation or the life or the actions that you are amen all right their purpose of existence has been dealt with slightly in the rest of this book but we can add two more scriptures Proverbs 16 the Lord has made the wicked for the day of evil job 2123 2130 the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they shall be bought brought forth to the day of Wrath all right so you got everybody got that there's four sections yes Eternal right right right foolish virgin yes ones that will be blotted out amen and ones that are sinners they just they're just going to walk right through right but now remember somebody's going to be judged by their works that's right that's what it says in Revelation and brother Brown just said it right here so let's go to the first section is eternal we're going to break the four sections down Revelations 13:8 all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written on the Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world so there's your Lamb's Book of Life when you when it says Lamb's Book of Life what does lamb constitute Redemption amen so there's your redeemable people the Lamb's Book of Life all right cuz he purchased them with his blood yes he did all right Revelation 21:27 and there shall in no wise enter into anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination he's talking about into the city or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life cuz remember the ones that are not in the Lamb's Book of Life they're going to be give some will be going to give an eternal life they can come into the city but they got to go back out live outside in the world right in the world I'm talking about the future home I'm way ahead over here in the future home now but the ones written in the Lamb's Book of Life they are the city that's right they don't just involve theel and they are the city that's why the city was built mhm Revelations 20 and 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those which are written in the book according to the words I put that one in there to show you one more time we're not included in that that's the second Resurrection right hello we come up in the first resurrection that's the second Resurrection we're are here judging this group of people here's a key according to their works if you stand before the Judgment seat it's going to be according to your works I don't ever want that to happen how many of you would like to be judged according to your works right now and you're born again nobody raised their hand all right that's the first section now let's go to First Corinthians 6 1-3 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints right we fall very short on this scripture right here do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters here in other words know ye not that you shall judge Angels how much more things that that pertain to this life right amen that means a brother taking another brother to court two real brothers won't do that won't happen just won't you going to break scripture if you do that's true dare any of you Paul was pretty ill with these Corinthians they were doing a lot of bad things dare any of you having a matter amongst you go to law before in other words before an unjust judge right mhm and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world but we're supposed to be able to judge and we will be I put that in there to show you that we're not part of that book in Revelations 20 we're doing the judging not being judged we're doing the judging all right so now foolish virgin now everybody knows to save time Matthew 25 1-13 you remember what happened there were five wise virgins MH that got oil in the lamp type of the Holy Ghost and then there was five foolish virgins now they were virgin to the word yes all right but they just didn't go on further they maybe had a pastor that didn't have the new birth your pastor don't have the new birth you don't have it or you going to find you one that does right cuz you can't go any higher than your pastor none of us I don't care who we are can go higher than our pastor okay what that's what the prophet said and I kind of believe it yes M five of them were wise five were foolish the five wise were in the Lamb's Book of Life correct to break this down right they were in the Lamb's Book of Life cuz they had the oil oil is the Holy Ghost the Lamb's Book of Life is the holy ghost in the life of the people that's don't think cleans you up M right holy ghost say don't thing cleans you up that's right so five of them took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wives took the oil with their lamps now you understand what happened when the bridegroom carried thank God he carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cowd behold the brown Grom comes go out and meet him then all the virgins arose right all of them did and the foolish said and the wise give us what you got that's cuz there's something not letting us get to your spot that's right and the foolish said un the wives give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wiv answered said not so least there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went the bridegroom came and they that were ready went with him now what happened to the other virgins afterwards came also the other virgin said Lord Lord open to us but he answered said barely verely I say unto you brother dick I know know you're not right I never knew you watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh all right so now let's go to the second quote sardian Church age now brother R's going to break this down for you I don't have to he's already done it the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment there is no other place they can come up for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is the resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the Judgment right amen John 5:24 you read that save time but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind right let's read that very very I say to you he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation shall not come into judgment is what it really says but it's passed permanently from Death un life everybody like that permanently I do but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the bride all right John 5:28 Marvel not at this for the hour has come which all all that are in the grave shall hear his voice that's not the first resurrection right all is not going to hear his voice in the first resurrection everybody understand yes all is not going to hear that or was I in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that done Evil under the resurrection of damnation now we all know that John 5:28-29 is not the Rapture right for only the dead in Christ will arise from the graves at that time along with the living bride who still is on the earth you see what that group is all right 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a sh voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord there's your first resurrection right first resurrection but it says in John 5:28 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of look in Revelations 20 we just read 11 through1 15 wherein the dead were brought before the Lord and judged according to their works and all those names were all whose names were not in the Book of Life were then cast into the Lake of Fire everybody there so far yes all right so there's your first section is the Eternal section the second section is the foolish virgin they will have to come before the judgment and be judged for their Works remember what a foolish virgin is he's a virgin to the word he or she but he does not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why it's very important because you know what if we take the baptism of the Holy Ghost we stand in the judgment and are not judged amen if we don't receive the Holy Ghost and just in the foolish virgin group you will have to be judged by your works that you've done on this Earth that's right exactly that's right first resurrection does not you're already judged you're already passed from Death un life Hallelujah to that we've done past all that but there's a group The foolish virgin that got to come up because you know what they're going to be hunted down like dogs give their life for the gospel after we're gone right after we're gone the foolish virgin still going to hold on to their faith they're going to say there's got to be something something wrong about this world system and about this Catholic church and about all this stuff and I'm going to make a stand for god well God's going to give them eternal life for their Works they'll come up and say he'll say Hey you stood for me this not scripture you stood for me so I now will stand for you all right but I don't want to be in that group cuz one little mess up and you go into this next section which is the borderline Christians those are the ones that had their names put on the book right but have been blotted out and then the fourth section is the ones that never were put on the book now look there's five things that can get your name blotted out of the book of life we're going to look at them right here the number three says how to be blotted out all right let's go to the next one number one is to serve Idols what did Dan and Ephraim do they served Idols their name was blotted out under heaven right all right Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone Hosea 4:17 First Kings tells you the whole story just keep scrolling through for time but you understand that that you can be blotted out for serving Idols right you ain't got to be like the idols they were serving right no anything you put before God is a idol that's all right so you can have your name blotted out if you serve Idols number two if you do not repent listen Exodus 32 3233 yet now if thou will forgive their sin and if not blot me I pray to thee out of the book talking about Moses and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book he told Moses they sin against me they're not repenting they just keep going on and on and doing the same thing over and over and over again well one day God's going to say that's it I'm done uh you don't need to repent the same thing every day if you repent the same thing every day you got a devil in you yeah right and you need to get him out or either you're not born again one of the two right same thing I mean I mean if I got a problem if I had a drinking problem and I drink tomorrow and say God forgive me God I fail sorry next day I go back to the liquor store God forgive me I fell go back and I got no you're not born again cuz what's inside of you will get that thing out of there he said whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out number three iniquity look in Psalm 69 cuz what happened to the children of Israel when they said let his blood be on us right and our children listen to this PM 69 this is showing what's going to happen happened when they crucified Christ they gave me also golf for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that which have been for their welfare let it become a trap Jesus went to be their welfare remember he went to the house of Israel he went to his people right let their eyes be darkened let they see not and make their loins continually to shap pour out thy indignation upon them and let th wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him who thou has smitten and they talk to the grief of Those whom thou has wounded add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous glory amen all right that's one way to be put out right that's pretty bad let's look at number three quote let's see what brother R say about that when Israel rejected the leadership of God in the pillar of fire and turned to worship the golden calvs their names were removed from The Book of Life Exodus 32:33 whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book if such turn to Idols demands the penalty of the removal of names from the book of life then most assuredly Israel's rejection of Jesus which is Iniquity as Messiah would demand a severe penalty that is exactly so in Psalm 69 which sets forth forth the humiliation of Jesus it's says in verse 2128 we just read that just we scrolling up through that same time let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous when the Jews rejected Jesus there was a literal Turning Away of God from them to the Gentiles amen all right we know then God did come to the Gentiles now number four it's really interesting here CL brother Claud and I were talking about these so we kind of put these together but stop following Jesus look in John 666 that brother said it yesterday he read several scriptures we're going to read today yesterday but John 666 number sound familiar yes the number of the Beast is it don't you think they took the mark of the beast cuz what happened this is the story of when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you know what he didn't stop to explain that right he just went right on that's right from that time many of his disciples went back and walk no more with him and I like what the brother said they probably didn't go out in the world they just went to a started going to another synagogue another message Church they didn't like what the preacher said so they went to another message church but their names were blotted out because they stopped following Jesus cuz from that time they walk no more with him hey you quit walking with Jesus Christ your name's going to go somewhere except in the book of life then number five is pretty simple add or take away reading Revelations 2219 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book all right everybody understand that right we are we are to a place right now to let me take a breather but listen talking about this is where we're going to get into the book of books we got time that shows you that when those books are open in Revelations 20 that you and I are going to be there as the judge right right judging Saints judging the world judging Angels amen so that book's not going to show up anywhere until it's Revelations 5 all right cuz it's not in 20 right right but now foolish virgin are going to have to stand right right then the Bible says they'll be divided as sheep and goats not as she not not sheep and goats sheep's already in the F but they're going to be divided as sheep and goats right all right so the goats are going to go to hell and the Sheep are going to he's going to say enter into the joy of the Lord that's going to be somebody that changes your tire or it's good to you I didn't read that quote but in there brother Brown says people that are good to the bride will be given eternal life and there'll probably be a lot more of them than it really will be bride you don't know if your neighbor never complains you know brother R said that woman uh if you saw it in the book she had short hair she had on shorts accepted a message but brother R said God's going to give her eternal life well she's going to be one of those that walks up right that God's going to say your Works your Works prove to me yes that you honored this man this Prophet yes and so enter into the joy of the Lord all right so there's the people for that then the ones that are blotted out that's the borderline Christians that's Judas judas's name was in the book right Great Signs wonders Miracles and all those things he had the min Min brother he didn't just was he didn't just have a separate Ministry he was in the ministry of those 12 going out teaching the word of God preaching the word of God having signs having wonders having Miracles yet he was void of the spirit right and his name was blotted out why he didn't go any further and he was judged for his Works amen all right we don't want to be judged for our works amen right we want our judgment to be on Jesus Christ amen not of our work and I know there's going to be a um a section that that we have to go through as far as we as Christians we're going to have to give an account for things that we don't repent of here that's right we're going to have to give an account for that but it's not going to be per se we're talking about this book of books all right because it's not going to be where you receive eternal life or not so we're not going to worry about that it's not going to be our names can never be blotted out if we're born again today your name can't be blotted out that's right all right so let's don't worry about that let's just get in that amen book MH become the book yes and we won't have to worry about it all right but I always wondered then we'll start on on right here in this quot number four this is where we're going to start the book of books everybody understand so far about what's going to happen at the white Throne judgment yes group of people comes up giv eternal life for their Works yes then there's a section that's going to say Hey you could have made it but this is why you didn't you're going over here then there's a section that's just going to just keep on walking right never be given eternal life never even have a chance because they turn the word down they etern God down somewhere they've turned God down and are brute Beast the Bible says made to be destroyed right and I feel sorry for those people but you know somebody was talking the other day in the end time in Revelations 3 it tells it says God told the people said I wish you were cold or I wish you were hot he wished that right if you're going to be cold be cold right if you going to be hot be hot the ones in the middle is the ones he going to spew out of his mouth the ones that lukewarm in other words the ones that profess Christianity but don't go all the way all right and that's a horrible group but listen to this this is really don't even look turn that off for a second please thank you listen to me Rahab the Harlot has always always bothered me she's a plain and simple prosecute same way with the woman that was thrown down in front of Jesus right CAU in the act of adulterine all right now listen this will help you what did Jesus do and say to that woman woman where's your accuser remember he said whoever has not committed sin cast the first stone yes right well when he looked up from whatever he was writing in the dirt when he looked up there was nobody to accuse this woman left and he told her he said your sins are forgiven you have no Witnesses there's no one here to accuse you right I always wondered about how Rahab got by with that have you ever read that story God killed all of her accusers right right I always wondered how Rahab could get by and marry an Israeli General and out of that Union comes OED and and Boaz and Jesse and David and all the way down to Christ and God not judged that woman he got rid of her accuser the Bible says when the walls of Jericho fell rahab's house was the only one left and and God told Joshua said kill man woman and children so God did away with all of her accusers so she could stand and marry and become righteous in the eyes of God sure didn't do away with her being a prostitute thank you Jesus but Jesus told the same woman the same thing said where's your accusers she said I have none he said well I didn't see you do it Go and sin no more got rid of all of her accusers I've always wondered about Ray after the other day I was sent on the porch and he just came to me he got rid of all the accusers amen so he's right there in the Bible same way Jesus dealt with a harlot in the New Testament God dealt with a harlot in the Old Testament and that old Harlot was me and you amen right we're not talking about some prostitute out here on the street we're talking about the prostitutes we were that's right that's right get forid of the accusers and we're going to get into that in just a little bit let's go to quote number four now let's start on the book of books cuz this is the part that I really enjoy now we're going to read the we're going to read this in invisible Union here it brings in you the two books that's going to be mysterious you saw brother brother you said there was one book you said now there was four sections in it just listen here it brings into view the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of The Seven Church ages now we just quoted that out of the church age book the two books book of life said one says you can put your name on it you never come off other one says you can take his name out of The Book of Life this brings it perfectly into view right here I'm going to stop a few minutes maybe and a few notes here and catch this before we close now remember what is he preaching invisible Union keep that in your mind invisible Union he's talking about Christ and the bride life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book God is the author of Life do you believe that congregation says amen our natural life here we have is just a perversion it really should be the right life to begin with but is perverted by the natural birth the first life or your first Union you were joined in at Birth by Nature a natural act Mom and Daddy what I'm looking at right now a natural human being associated man and woman together Associated together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death right how can you miss seeing the serpent seed all right keep going your name of your first nature was born and put in the Book of Life all all your Deeds was wrote in it two everything you've done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life you notice in Daniel when he come to the Ancient of Days his hair was as white as wool 10,000 time 10,000s came to him to minister him the bride and then the books were open and another book was open which was The Book of Life see there is Saints already there amen the church the bride another book was open we just read that that was that's you come at Revelations 20 another book was open which is The Book of Life all right now your old book is gone with your old Union skipping on down a few chap few if you'll see that's 215 down to 223 now your old book is gone with your old Union that's right so that's gone right now your name and your old and your has been transferred right now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God Amen right now your name is on the new book not the book of life right but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed going back to Revelations 5 not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah GL your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold in other words you heard from that you heard from your the you heard from the word of God that he put there for you before the foundation of the world that he knew you would respond to that was my quote take hold now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 says yeah Romans 51 says therefore being justified by faith Look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil thing and everything then you come around and say to me you found out I didn't do it then you come around and say brother B I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it that's right in the first place see now if I did do it I'm guilty but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word Justified is though you never done it amen it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage right your first marriage remember your husband's got to be dead to marry Christ right you were married to the devil he made all these accusations he made all these things he he told you you wasn't worth anything he slapped you around he did all these things to you right right well if he's dead you can marry again right he's not dead you're still married to him and you're committing adultery that's right brother amen now if I did it I'm guilty but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word Justified is though you never done it amen that's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorce and death it's not even in the memories of God Amen you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused it's what Satan is he's the accuser of the Brethren right you were accused your old buddies know you did it yeah you was accused you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness when are we going to start believing that all all of sleep you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place right he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed how do you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent e mhm it's no fault of your own nobody had any dealings with getting theirself here amen right to your adult's parent Eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adulteress you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it you had no no you it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world that little Genesis 126 and 27 right that's where that's where it begun if you want to say there was a beginning right that's where it begun that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life God had to open those Seven Seals not in the denomination he opened those seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days to who Amen to sons of God not to the world there is your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life your name is in there is predestinated on there it can't go because you can no more take that away than nothing see because it was foreordained to be in there but the regular Book of Life can take that off at any time what we were talking about here see you don't repent it's off anyhow cuz you're going to stand the Judgment the bride don't stand the Judgment goes in the Rapture now we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord there is your name on the book The Book of Life is a word of God cuz the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became on word right and if you're here to do that want it vindicate that word right is that correct that was a pretty long quote but that was finished now let's go to Hebrews 105 wherefore when he cometh into the world he say sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me first 2 Corinthians 3 1-3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some other Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you you are our epistle written in our heart known and read of all men but as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink right this book is not written with ink right but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but where in fleshly tables of the heart I'm getting something here fleshly look at all that where it says flesh but a body thou H has prepared me look look what God's trying to get us to see Revelations 5 now I want us to see something right here now remember all the things that brother Dale has been preaching job says in my flesh I shall see God right he say in my soul he say in my spirit he said in my flesh I want everybody to wake up amen amen this is important you wouldn't go to sleep in the third quarter of a football game I promise you that revelation 5 well what's our desire folks we got to have a desire for the word of God and I saw in the right hand of him that s on the throne a book written within right and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice now watch what he says who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look at it right mhm right and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on right this is what I want you to see today why I named it the book of books yeah pay attention look at me okay okay is there anything in the scripture that says the book wasn't worthy I may be wrong show me scripture where it say the book's not worthy yeah cuz you w't even supposed to look at it the book not the lamb the book that's right yeah it says you're not even worthy to look at it so something must be very Worthy in that book that's right we've always spent all these years saying well no man was worthy no man was worthy what about the book right what about the book Brother D what about the book he knows that right what about the book it didn't say the book was not worthy it says no man was worthy to get the book and do anything with it not even to look at it right and one of the elders said weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof what is this book Judas is not in that book right Saul right is not in the book David is not in that book right right Isaiah is not in that book Jeremiah is not in that book John the Baptist is not in it book right right Elijah is not in that book they weren't counted worthy under the blood of bulls and goats that's right that's right and I behold low in the midst of the throne and the four beast in the midst of the elders stood the lamb and had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes there's no way there there's no way this scene could happen until the church Ages were fulfilled that's right amen let's go back to the Jubilee year 7 sevens is 49 49 you don't all go free partially you can go free the baptism of the Holy Ghost freed a lot of those people that were in that book names yes Paul arenus Martin Columba and fill in the blank up until now William brandom right fill in the blank but the seven horns and seven eyes had to come up it had to be in after the church ages we're finished amen right it's when this lamb takes a book now listen I'm going to go slow so you can pay attention to my notes in Revelations 5 that's why I call this now this is my Sublime book of books brother Brown said this was the most Sublime scripture in the Bible right amen cuz it was a special group of people that God only knew right the devil can't get to those people because if you believe the way I believe that book was Genesis 1:26 and 2 right man that's right that Adam couldn't produce and the original title deed owner had to take the book right which only had the names of the redeemed amen and he had to hold on to it but he came as a Son of God and sat down on the throne of those seven Church ages okay right right that true he had the book so the book must have been worthy that's right in Genesis 126 and 27 there is no sin there is no adultery there is no condemnation there is nothing right so let's start now looking at the book is being worthy not just the one sitting on the throne not just the lamb taking the book cuz you know what Jesus Christ is not going to reach and grab anything that's not worthy that's right he's not going to come after something that's not worthy he's not going to have this whole scene set up and reach and get a book and see filth in it that's right praise praise the Lord yes Lord Genesis 1:26 and 27 that was the book of all the Nam of the redeemed now look if my past is not blotted out I've got to stand in front of the Judgment that's right only on my works right right you remember that from back when now look this scene is one on the throne with that book and that book is the title deed to Redemption that's the name of the redeemed everybody understand that all right and it's what it's closed up closed up now we know by being on the father's Throne he did let the names out down through the church ages right right but for us to come to a place for total Redemption something's got to be shown Glory all right right this is where it gets thick now remember the father's Throne is the Son of God right yes in spirit form the Holy Ghost down through the church ages everybody know that right yeah Spirit God that Throne that one sitting on the throne with the book in his hand was the son of God that was the spirit God down through the church ages right theophany okay theophanies don't bleed right right theophanes don't bleed so there had to be a scene of him IM morphing right into a human man amen to bleed come around take the book and turn around and sit down right right there's your scene all right now listen theophanes don't bleed but the lamb bled amen sure I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was a blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon a cross Glory the Holy Ghost and seven horns and seven eyes produced the lamb for their ages right right man that's what was coming to get amen all right now we're talking about the Eternal section don't worry about anybody else now we're talking about the Eternal section don't worry about what happened to Judas and what happened to this one what happened to grandma or any of these I'm talking about you guys okay right if you're not born again then you need to get over into this section of the book amen all right now the father had this book then since Adam right right right Father Strong he was the possessor of that book Glory from Adam we know Christ came with the book in him cuz he was the man sitting on the throne come on he's he's he's he's fulfilling he's only one God but he's fulfilling Offices here I seen amen father's Throne he's sitting here with a book in his hand getting ready to hand it to somebody but now watch it was a blood of atonement the lamb wasn't the offing it was a flesh God right a body that has prepared me sure now we know Jesus Christ like Dad said today we know Jesus Christ did that but what form did he do it in yeah you testified to you testified to you testified to you Jesus Christ himself in in in body form has never testified to you right oh yeah amen that's right but God in flesh right has testified to you God in flesh is the one that the seed comes out of the body God in flesh went from a from a meeting over here to an Ethiopian unit yes Philip Phillip was God in flesh yes he was for his day he was God in flesh amen but remember it was a blood atonement blood had to be shown everybody got that right and we're only set free by they were only set free by the Holy Ghost in their soul down through the seven Church ages everybody understand it up until today today yes today I'm talking about today we're bringing this right up to today amen all right now this lamb takes a book on a 50 not a 49 that right on a 49 that's what they've been down through the church ages look in Leviticus all the scriptures in the Old Testament 49 on that 49th year some things could go free free right but on the 50 everything went free when that lamb takes this book everything's going free that's right everything's going to be revealed everything's going to be made known everybody understand that but it had to be revealed to be made manifest that's right Glory he does it he reveals it then he makes it manifest right everybody think I'm going slow now cuz I want you to listen he does it reveals it and makes it manifest course got so he's got to reveal it to make it manifest right and where's he going to be make it made it manifest in you that's right the lamb that takes the book that's right cuz maybe I'm getting a little ahead of brother Dale but that lamb that takes the book if you got to produce that lamb then that's you taking the book sure you're part right cuz your name's in that book amen right right right yes had to be in the right hand mhm soz there's where the power is right the power and authority and it had to come to a mature group of people but listen to this here's the home stretch right here let's pull up quote number five it is rising of the sun there was the first sheath come up from all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of all prophets there has been churches churches Brides brides Brides churches Brides brides right been a lot of brides been a lot of churches you reading this with me but there has got to come one Glory one Hallelujah there has come there has to come a real bride not saying the other Brides were false that's right right but they got to come one right right mhm there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics with it of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place find it that means we got to seek for it what good does it do to polish the Hut what good does it do they give her a good facelift or a Simoniz job for those of you that are younger Simoniz means wax cuz there was only one thing back when we were growing up and that was simonit Turtle Wax all right so why I give it a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ who are you and I right cold stiff and dead some of y'all came raise your hand and say hallelujah praise God but if you go to have life in you one day you'll be able to go man I hate to do this but you know you go to other functions and man you know people throwing stuff and you know doing all this and we just say well praise God he saved me no he's going to come a power in this bride that you not going to be able to control yourself that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in L Jordan Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive how is that and his bride and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he is not he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the D Dynamics to prove it amen and has he being the groom I want you to listen to this real close CU I'm going to bring out something right here and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him now he said he's had Brides brides churches churches Brides brides but there's coming one right right that's right and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation yes sir any others has spoke of the Bride let me read it again it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations they didn't have all the revelations down Through the Ages any other has spoken of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one a woman taken from his side she had taken the spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife amen hold that word wife cuz it was Brides brides churches you can have Brides but you only got one wife that's right the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together made mechanics and Dynamics until the church or the people in other words till we wake up and realize that we're just going to sit here and preach sermons just like this so now Revelations 197 I want you to really pay attention to this cuz remember God's an accuser of the Brethren right all down Through the Ages he's accused of all kind of stuff you know right right you not do that you no I guess y'all I'm farther long than I am then listen to this Revelations 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready yes yes Lord now down through time brother BR said we he's had Brides brides churches churches but there's coming one right one there's coming one that he's looking for that's right the devil has beat us around as long as that book is closed we can't become the part that we're supposed to be right that's true it's sealed up right right right sealed right let's go to Deuteronomy 22 I know this is a carnal um comparison but it was put in the Bible for some reason and I'm going to you know it's like I heard a brother uh actually brother Aaron brought this point out Sunday brother Aaron McGary when we were in witcon I thought it was good let's remember don't take these types all the way but let's watch and see what happens here if any man take a wife and go in her and hate her remember who you whole husband used to be oh yeah and give occasion of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and he's going to say I took this woman and when I came into her I found her not a mid and no Lord not a burger then shall the father and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the down virginity unto the Elders of the city yeah and they point at it and for you older people you know what tokens of virginity is there was a cloth placed under the female on the night of her marriage and if the blood was there she was a virgin that's right if it wasn't there she was killed that's right that's right look what the daddy does and the D's father said saying to the elders I give my daughter under this man to wife he hated her lo Heath give occasion of speech against her he said all these things about her I found not my Virgin and my daughter a maiden and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity what did he do and they shall spread the cloth for the Elders of the city and say look when I see the blood when I Glory see the blood when I see the blood I will pass I will pass eyes over you amen and they shall spread the cloth when he Reon got that book he opened it Glory he said silence I don't want to hear no more right I've proven that she's my wife that's right right she's not my bride anymore that's right right amen she's my wife and I've got the token yes of her virginity Glory thank you Lord thank you Jesus thank you and open the book amen that loose me and you right right what he looses from sin cuz the Elders of the city could make no more accusations after that cloth was spread out because there was the evidence going back to the first that's right there's the evidence MH that's why that's the most Sublime scripture in the Bible now let's go to the next one let's read now this is what happened what did we say it was strongs 975 a sheet on which something had been written right it wasn't it wasn't a word it was the blood the token of your Purity right God proved the evidence in Revelations 5 he opened the book and he said shut up thank you Lord shut up silence in heaven she's worthy cuz she's my wife Glory she hasn't been running around with anybody else She's mine and she's my wife from now on she's not you can't even accuse her anymore cuz it's done here's the token to if that token was not put over the door which was what blood that's right then those people died right they come out of the land of Egypt like brother for always says the breach produced the bleach because when you look at red three red Glory right you get white yeah right sir red through red it's white you ever wonder why God put it in chapter 5 g r a c e righten there's the grace people he was worthy to take it and turn around and show it to the world right right which are your accusers he spread it out and reveal that we are his wife he and he then he opened our eyes to show it out of this book and we don't have to go get it from another book this is the book we get it from right here brother Brown what is that called the bleeding word right invisible Union we'll read it in just a second John shouted and I would have shouted if I had have been there amen if the one that took the book was worthy then the contents of the book was also Worthy righten all he was doing was in the acts of a play and he was showing what he was doing right worthy amen Revelations 5 verse 7-10 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken that book the four beast and 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having and every one of them golden hearts and golden bows full of oders which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying what Thou Art Worthy to take the book now let's keep going Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and it doesn't stop there right amen he's fixing too it didn't say and and we made you King and has made that was weak and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests GL and we shall reign on the earth red through red pull it up that's right it blocks my sin not me that's right cuz I'm in the booken the Red Blocks my sin sister but God can't block me out cuz my name's in that Booky tokens of our virginity right if you see married to the first husband you're committing adultery right but if your first husband's dead right amen you know Christ makes us a burden you know that we're not we're not burdened Christ makes us a burden the word makes us a burden exactly right but they don't have this quote but I'm if I can find it I'm going to read it and I pulled it up back there in the back this is on invisible Union I just didn't read down far enough what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word I believe in God which is the word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word becomes blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the word word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart staying on God and on his word that book that John took or that the lamb took remember it's the same book in Revelations 10 sure that the mighty Angel handed to John and told John to eat the book right right told John eat that book John takes the book and eats it that book disappears yeah that book is seen no more until Revelations 20 and that book is now standing in judgment right it has become a group of people right it's been Blood Bought Blood Washed listen folks the blood of Jesus Christ not only cleanses your spirit your soul but it cleanses your body amen cuz he didn't just claim part of you he claimed all of you he wants all of you I want us to remember that remember about Rahab where are your accusers God will get rid of your accusers if you'll let him he got rid of Rahab he got rid of the woman that was thrown before him actually in Deuteronomy the father steps forth and says look here's the book yes he spread it open there's my token amen you can't touch me I was a virgin amen now I'm not the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm the wife of Jesus Christ cuz there's been Brides brides churches Brides brides but they'll come one one that's going to believe this it's not that this word this word's been written for now about 8 or 900 years yes in this form right here right but until that thing opened up that's what got me when that brother said he opened it up and proved to the whole city so where are your accusers that's right and then it came to me shut up silence what is the seventh seal silence in heaven silence all your accusers have been done away with amen but you got to believe that you got to believe that that's right that your accusers are done away with right oh he's not he's not ever going to play around in this brain up here but all you got to do is just open up show him your token of your virginity look um it's not what brother collie says about me it's what God said about me what God said about me he said I'm a virgin I proved to him that I've stayed a virgin now I'm his wife that's right I'm his wife forever more you can't do away with that that's right and that's what the whole book is the whole book is his wife Genesis 126 and 27 is the wife the body the body of Jesus Christ yes who you and are right you and I are the body of Jesus Christ the wife thank you in that scene one more thing before we go let's stand you know the lamb could take that book Brother Gary he take that book and turn it around just like this and go wasn't he split open right here is when is this when the bride came out brother BR said we got to get back got to get back into the side right remember the first Adam was closed up bride couldn't get back in this Adam he just takes a book slides it right back in because I read you the quote she is him exactly she is him that's right right if you see me you're going to see sin but if you see him that's it he's done away with all your accusers he's done away with everything that anybody's ever accused you of doing he has done away with it cuz you can't find me cuz every time you see me you're supposed to see him amen that's right John ate that book and it disappeared right but it didn't go away it became greater and greater as those Church ages came about and as God revealed himself more and more in that last Church age we had a prophet that could prove that the lamb was there what was he doing he was showing our name in the book glory and that it's not our righteousness our works is what he's done right Lord red through red blocks out my sin it doesn't block me out let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord today that something's been said that maybe we can understand a little more about you that we can realize Lord that it's not our works or our Good Deeds or or anything we've done we just we're tired of the accuser of the Brethren we're tired of of someone accusing us of of things and and and not looking at the word father we need to look to you the author and finisher of our faith the one that the one that gave your life Lord and we know it now was the blood the blood's always been a token but it was a token in the Old Testament of a of a lamb that was a natural lamb that did not have a soul but father Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world came on the earth John pointed and said there he is same thing The Same Spirit of Elijah in the end time and a little Prophet called William Brandon pointed and said Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world and Lord he made you manifest and he made you known to the people and father I pray that our little ideas and our and our uh doctrines and and denominational thoughts and ideas Lord will be cast out that you'll come forth Lord and be the father and show that token of our virginity and show the world and show the show the elders and the accusers say look this is my sinless wife yes Lord this is my wife that I bought she's Blood Bought she's Blood Washed and I can never blot her out of my mind I can never get her out of my mind Lord when you were on the cross the ssong says we were there on your mind because you were dying for a special group of people a people that would live in the worst time since the beginning of man but you promised us that you would take us through this and you promis us Lord that You' never leave us or never forsake us that where that we are that you'll be there also and that the word of God will be made manifest in a group of people Lord I pray that you'll just come Among Us Lord and show yourself today Father L that you're the one true and living God and Jesus is your name you are our father but also our our bride Lord bridegroom father you're the one that brought yourself you didn't send another person Lord You Came yourself and you sent your word down and Lord and opened it up down through the church ages but father there was always something withholding you were with you had the book there in the form that you were revealing yourself Through the Ages but Lord in the end time a prophet comes on the scene and says here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a w horse rider there goes the accuser Lord when you get rid of our accusers father maybe we'll start realizing where we're at and the things that we're doing Lord father forgive us of our sins which are many and our mistakes which are many Lord and our being dilatory toward the word father I pray that you'd give us an energizing that that Lord that Dynamics will fall on the mechanic Lord we've heard your word I believe in its pure form and I pray Lord that all the things that have been said now will come together Lord that you'll show us there in Revelations father five that that it was a worthy book because it was a worthy group of people in the book it was not something that was unworthy but Lord you were worthy to take the book and show us that we are now worthy to do all the things that you promised in this word thank you Lord Jesus father give us strength for the journey be with the pastor and bless him Lord be with the ones that are all around us the ones at work the deacons Elders Lord the ones that are that are seasoned in the gospel that that help us through life father the the ones that are just sit in the Pew Lord and and draw you father we pray that you'd bless them Lord oh Jesus Jesus and I pray not there be any sick among us Lord that you would heal them now father that you would send your word down Lord thank you Lord touch us Lord everything we need Lord is already done the seals have been tore off the book The Cloth has been spread and the world can be silent now because the Bride of Jesus Christ has been shown to the world Lord we pray that you just take care of us Lord thank you Lord bless us now thank you Lord I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was a blood for me one day when I was he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood for me whose was itel when I was he I know it was I know one day when I was L he died upon a cross and I know it was the blood for me it was Emmanuel's blood uel's one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was BL for you know told Brother Bill last Sunday everybody enjoyed brother Bill being here last Sunday I'm sure I know I did and I told him I said you know that's the way it should be right I know the musicians need to come and play but all of our Focus we weren't standing we were sitting when that person walked up you knew there was a person standing there and needed prayer I immediately went to praying I didn't go to singing and that's okay I'm not I'm not saying we shouldn't do that but but everything was focused on a Prayer right yes and a thought and nobody was standing everybody was sit sitting down now brother R did the same thing he didn't have everybody stand during prayer lines everybody sit down the ones that needed prayer stood up they come forward what then we focused all of our prayer on that okay that's what I liked about that and it was just a silent it was brother Bill used to be he could run around this pull pit on the top back when he was younger and he'd probably try it now but he's he's he's settled down now to where he just says hey I'm not going to touch you we're just going to pray a lot of people don't like brother Bill but I like his stand for the word I like his stand for the way that he believes cuz it's in the word of God I know the word of God says lay hands on a sick but when are we going to say Mountain you don't have to go lay your hands on the mountain mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart right I know it was the blood I know it the blood it was it wasel's it was Emmanuel's BL for one day when I was lost he di the cross it was the blood for sometimes when you get down and out if he has covered you with his blood just go read the Bible where it talks about the atonement the token the blood's been applied he shed his blood and you'll realize one thing that was worthy that man was Worthy amen and by the by him putting his red blood on your red sins red through red is white right red through red is always you going to get white so red blood through your red Sin Satan you can't accuse me no more that's right now see if you don't have a token of your virginity if you don't have something to show him if you ain't got the token you can't show it right right you got to have the token am I like brother dick I was thinking the other day when you talking about you know the brother was talking about yesterday about depart from me I never knew you see that's what we're talking about there was never a relationship there so what God's going to do he's going to open the book and he's not going to see any token of some person's giving their life their virginity to him and he's going to say depart from me you're not in the book right I never knew you because those in Genesis 126 and 27 he's had an intimate relationship with that is that is his wife that's right that is the wife of Jesus Christ that God preserved before the foundation of the world that's where our names were written before the foundation of the world and we cannot have him took out he can't blot his own self out that's right he can't he can't blot his own self out right and brother Brown said one time said I no more die God can die right you may take this thing and put it in a hole somewhere I'm not dead I'm alive that's right I've shown the token of my virginity and I you got to bring me up but somebody's going to stand there and say Satan I'm covered completely Mom and Daddy brought this thing here but you know what I've been chained I've been reborn all my life has been rearranged oh what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way
