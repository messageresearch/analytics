[2:46] any other things that we just think I'm
[2:49] gonna go right to the word Lord and you
[2:52] know my style
[2:54] hella girl and we just goin please God
[3:02] so if you got your Bibles this evening
[3:07] we will read two places in the street
[3:10] scriptures st. Matthew the fourth
[3:12] chapter in the fourth verse I read and
[3:16] I'm sorry from Saint Luke the fourth
[3:18] chapter and we see it right here it says
[3:22] everybody we read this when Jesus was
[3:25] the greatest temptation and Satan gave
[3:28] him three major temptation in the body
[3:30] spirit and soul and I saw you begin to
[3:33] look at he says in Matthew 4 you
[3:35] tempting at me saying
[3:37] and jesus answered and said it is
[3:40] written man should not live by bread
[3:43] alone but by but by every word that
[3:48] proceedeth out of the mouth of God and
[3:52] st. Luke the fourth chapter and I have a
[3:59] beginning at st. Luke the fourth chapter
[4:06] in verse 17 and it raised like this in
[4:10] the need we know the started Jesus right
[4:12] here is identifying himself in
[4:16] description and he says and they were
[4:19] delivered unto him the book of the
[4:21] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[4:23] the book he found the place where it was
[4:26] written remember he was the only one
[4:29] and there was no man worthy to open the
[4:31] book it was in all the profits and
[4:33] everything then he said the Spirit of
[4:36] the Lord is upon me because he has
[4:39] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[4:42] poor he has sent me to heal the
[4:44] brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the
[4:46] captives and recovery of sight to the
[4:49] blind to set at liberty to them that are
[4:52] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[4:55] the Lord
[4:56] and didn't he done what he closeable and
[4:58] in the word he'd had the ability to open
[5:00] in the closing it and he gave it again
[5:03] in to the ministers and he sat down and
[5:05] eyes of all them that were in the
[5:07] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[5:10] began to say didn't I said to him this
[5:13] day is the scripture fulfilled in your
[5:16] ears
[5:17] let us pray father help me one more time
[5:21] - you're my body my mind my soul my
[5:27] spirit to you O God my lord help me to
[5:30] surrender myself over to the will of God
[5:32] now father God I give you all my
[5:34] strength this evening and the name of
[5:36] Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you
[5:40] you may be seen at one moment thank the
[5:43] Lord for the reading of the word of God
[5:45] this evening I like what I like with the
[5:48] Bible says here that you know what Jeter
[5:50] realized he told him is that just day is
[5:53] the scripture fulfilled in your very
[5:55] ears in and fulfilled in your ears and
[5:58] and I begin to look at this word of God
[6:00] this evening as I begin to take a
[6:02] thought from here this day is the
[6:05] scripture fulfilled in a forward body by
[6:09] forward body and the reason I talk about
[6:11] it because we want to realize here the
[6:13] only way that God can fulfill himself
[6:15] they gotta help a body to do it in under
[6:18] so we begin and again I killed right
[6:20] here so Jesus himself and he was busy
[6:23] with if he was going to die and he was
[6:25] tempted and then he was kept in a and
[6:29] going through the grain is one of the
[6:30] greatest temptation it was and it does
[6:33] no scroller temptation that we can have
[6:36] physically then be hungry
[6:39] how do yet fasted forty days and forty
[6:41] nights wanted to scroll in this aisle
[6:44] that's in your body is hunger now you
[6:47] know I don't know you might not feel
[6:49] like it is but brother and cities were
[6:51] he thing if you get hungry enough you
[6:54] eat out of a garbage in how many so
[6:56] Jesus himself when attempted would one
[6:59] of the greatest prey or desire that a
[7:02] man hath when a man is hungry what he
[7:04] won't do for his own stomach honey but
[7:07] he proved he had to say he had to pull
[7:10] his body subject to the word and tell
[7:13] the devil I was not being to eatin bread
[7:16] I'm gonna live by the word of the God of
[7:18] my the word of father so I begin to look
[7:21] at I begin to look is oh we realized
[7:23] what he did he had overcome that desire
[7:25] of a flushing and the day we got the
[7:28] same desire some people say well I don't
[7:30] work how do you know I talk to people
[7:32] all day they'll tell you something they
[7:34] won't eat think you say I talk to people
[7:37] sometime I say we had you ever try to
[7:39] eat possum I never eat that nasty stuff
[7:41] I said wait you don't say never I just
[7:45] got one day pause I pop it might look
[7:47] like a buffet never say never you know
[7:51] you get hungry enough and that possum
[7:53] dad somebody gotta go and at work show
[7:55] you know so we don't want to we don't
[7:56] want to put ourself in the position
[7:58] either what we just hadn't breached yet
[8:00] we had never reached that level hunger
[8:03] that we were what we willing to either
[8:05] hamburger out of a garbage can
[8:07] honey but the point of the deal the
[8:09] point of it is that desire gina was sure
[8:12] here honey I got a scroll a desire for
[8:15] God can I do my body my human desire
[8:21] remember he was tempted in every measure
[8:25] in every way that we are tempted in and
[8:28] that devil came to him and kept at him
[8:31] when he had fasted forty days and forty
[8:33] nights with the greatest tip that you
[8:36] can do it he was hungry and he was tired
[8:38] honey tree what a tip you will you turn
[8:42] against God will you to pray will you
[8:44] let
[8:44] word go discern then save your stomach
[8:47] save your life to it when a man is
[8:49] hungry and thirsty he might do anything
[8:52] to live
[8:53] but Jesus said man should not live by
[8:56] bread alone but by every word never seen
[9:00] another my god
[9:01] why could he said it because he came in
[9:03] his word body he didn't in the word so
[9:06] we want to look here they don't work
[9:08] shall we begin to look at this later
[9:09] Jesus came in his word body hawlucha we
[9:12] begin to look at these things right here
[9:14] and there were sorry Elijah so now we
[9:16] begin to look at Jesus being a full word
[9:19] of God he was in know we we pass out the
[9:22] off me but Gina did not die fast as the
[9:26] oven he came in his word body when he
[9:30] came he was in the beginning he was the
[9:32] word and the word was with god and the
[9:35] word was god and the word was made flesh
[9:38] haloo he came and his word body-hugging
[9:41] so when he came he was a man a man but
[9:46] the point of it what he would kept it
[9:48] and he was different the one thing that
[9:50] he was different with me you he was not
[9:52] born the way we were born but he was
[9:56] Mary ate food things that the earth
[10:00] was a cursed product of God so
[10:03] everything to come from Earth were
[10:04] cursed at it so what it is she would do
[10:07] when she built when that body began to
[10:09] grow up and things that she in other
[10:11] words and I would and everything the
[10:14] body can feel see the body revealed the
[10:17] body can feel what it is to be weak the
[10:19] body can feel what it was to be tired
[10:20] but all we look at past the human
[10:23] reality of Gina down on the solar
[10:25] cheetah was God coming down on the third
[10:29] grandma Gina what the seed of God
[10:31] because he was God I mean he could not
[10:34] he could not if he would have felt right
[10:36] here we all would have failed but he
[10:39] overcame his bush
[10:40] and anyway trying to tell us something
[10:43] we could do all day if we put the word
[10:45] first I want you to notice here let me
[10:50] let me back up for a few minutes here so
[10:52] we realized here so we rely why would
[10:54] what would the del why didn't their with
[10:56] chip
[10:57] what was this girl was saying it was but
[10:59] when as focused as I were what the tip
[11:01] I'll have a desire a scroll compassion a
[11:04] desire for something I knew didn't work
[11:07] we real I wonder what was the first day
[11:09] to happen with me when the chart fell
[11:12] evil
[11:13] how do one she fell from she fell from
[11:16] her desire for the word she lost the
[11:20] design for the word Nancy Tucker desired
[11:23] in her body
[11:24] anyone lush the briman said she she woke
[11:28] up run the word and she took over larval
[11:31] hello so desire for Lux but knowledge
[11:34] however he did not get pregnant in a
[11:37] wool first she got pregnant in a my
[11:40] first desire with chain and she started
[11:44] to design thank you more than she did in
[11:46] the word other people we gotta take the
[11:49] word how are we gonna decide the word
[11:51] more do we do sensation or any other
[11:53] pleasure we gonna go heaven and earth
[11:55] will pass away but jesus said my
[11:57] workshop available I begin to look at
[12:02] something getting a look at these things
[12:04] right here and we want to realize you
[12:07] that's what it's all the revelation it
[12:09] is the world listeners were the
[12:11] revelation that we could we try we we
[12:13] want today the stronger say that we got
[12:15] to have in our life of a desire to serve
[12:19] God we never say we got honey the pain
[12:22] today to be Brazil what the same
[12:24] fighting the people with today change it
[12:26] the desire to be changing their desire
[12:30] sorry no longer desire to be like crying
[12:33] they they they crave for and design how
[12:37] they trying to quit a holy thirst of God
[12:40] with things of the world so we were
[12:43] gonna realize here that's what that was
[12:45] such a bother in his hand if it's a good
[12:47] a domani a drug trial in his age because
[12:51] we realize
[12:52] Satan is trying to stop this ride for
[12:54] recognizing that she is the word for
[12:57] this hour how do you never wake up again
[12:59] and I took a quotation here they'll
[13:02] probably begin to speak on her in other
[13:05] words we find unchaining desire how do
[13:08] we realize here in Christ the mystery of
[13:10] God revealed they bent until he began to
[13:12] speak he's a he's an in there would be a
[13:16] time come for window when he would
[13:21] express himself in his fullness of his
[13:25] Godhead honey that's what the devil ate
[13:29] that's what the devil once the bride
[13:33] recognized had the former's of the
[13:39] crisis put this up in you now the city
[13:42] says anything the fullness of his guy at
[13:45] guilty through his church having the
[13:49] preeminence in his church oh my he said
[13:52] what the anointed man do you know the
[13:56] man now the anointed peoples oh my to
[13:59] bring back the anointed bride and the
[14:03] bridegroom knowing about what makes
[14:06] everyone it's exactly what Eve turned
[14:09] down honey
[14:10] and Adam and I don't come back with live
[14:15] and he know that the second I'll come
[14:18] back here knowing that no any word not
[14:20] knowing of the word because he said my
[14:23] words they are spirit and day my words
[14:25] are spirit see anointed with what the
[14:28] word some of the point of here is not
[14:31] what he's these stories going back he
[14:33] restored by the for revelation of the
[14:36] Godhead why this same attack the Godhead
[14:38] because if you ain't got your hand right
[14:41] how can you fall he's gonna light come
[14:43] through the heads I'm baby could be born
[14:47] deformed it might be not happen along a
[14:50] baby could be born without leave
[14:53] but he could not be born without a head
[14:56] you see what saying it got to have a
[14:59] head for the body deliver so say in the
[15:01] mood to me lady he change his job you is
[15:04] to change the desire for the word
[15:09] Godhead and if you notice what did he
[15:12] tell see the desert was sold in prison

[15:34] Rama sworn Romans 1 and I'm gonna begin
[15:40] reading reading it let me begin let me
[15:45] begin at the 19 verse maybe now into the
[15:48] 21st maybe I might really look glance
[15:50] there but 1990 20 verse it says Romans
[15:53] 1:19 19 verse is that because that which
[15:59] may be known of God is manifest in them
[16:06] for God showed unto them for the
[16:10] invisible things which you do we change
[16:14] he's dealing with people that just come
[16:16] always saying it out and then what
[16:19] people don't work needs away when people
[16:21] God is world when you people got
[16:24] testified I know God how do I another
[16:27] one that comes in a revelation all the
[16:29] knowledge of Godhead they come to the
[16:32] revelation that knowledge of the garden
[16:34] not not not revelation knowledge he
[16:37] gonna leave you got to Revelation you
[16:39] will not change your views on God this
[16:42] she says here for the invisible things
[16:44] of God I like the visual things of him
[16:47] from the creation of the world are
[16:50] clearly seen not something in here not
[16:53] something that not reveal hadn't before
[16:55] gauger bringing in diapers he had to
[16:57] show you the truth
[16:59] clearly singing been under being
[17:03] understood by the things that are made
[17:07] even his eternal power and his Godhead
[17:10] fourth day for that they all went out in
[17:14] his huge so now he putting the right
[17:16] here he said if they and he would say he
[17:19] did Hurley was now they are without an
[17:22] excuse
[17:22] hello God did another one he says if you
[17:25] notice the critic vertical burns he said
[17:27] because that wind a new god holy with
[17:31] because when they knew God how do they
[17:34] had a understanding people don't leave
[17:36] in the message now how do they how to
[17:38] understand this minute and sold in
[17:41] prison now how can you help you know
[17:44] what what is that without an excuse
[17:46] means hold it 21st verse it means to
[17:52] forgive someone for making a mistake or
[17:56] doing something that's wrong and there
[17:58] was somebody that made a mistake this is
[18:00] another mistake this is when they come
[18:02] to the true in other words dinner they
[18:05] don't want to come to the truth and they
[18:07] refuse the word they have a desire they
[18:10] can be changed from God how do people we
[18:13] gotta make sure how do you get a new
[18:15] birth and I express with God will never
[18:18] change me go God does not change
[18:24] he said because that when they knew God
[18:26] they glorified him not as God neither
[18:32] were they thankful but became vain
[18:36] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[18:39] darkened professing themself to me
[18:41] professing them decide to be wise they
[18:43] became fools and change that's what a
[18:48] problem with that were the problem none
[18:51] that been in the run dismissing today
[18:52] whether they would say do it he's
[18:54] marking the people that the people are
[18:56] changing harder they don't heard all the
[18:59] truth the Godhead the oneness of God the
[19:01] grain of God and now all of a sudden hey
[19:04] legally ready to change it how do they
[19:06] trying to make God something that babies
[19:09] are scared of what the world design
[19:12] anyway he's at the twin turret and they
[19:17] chained of glory the glory of the
[19:21] uncorruptible God into an image made
[19:23] like to corruptible man and beasts and
[19:27] creeping things and what wherefore God
[19:30] giving him home cleaning it that day st.
[19:33] Luke's 1730 could not people feel okay
[19:36] they heard the word how did that work of
[19:39] breaking the indictment once they heard
[19:40] of God and Satan who the true night
[19:47] didn't fit you see he preached the truth
[19:49] the promise that he bring in this year
[19:52] you either accept it or turn it up
[19:54] why would he come back to Godhead they
[19:57] rejected the God is not what we got
[19:59] perversion
[20:00] how do people turn from the word and
[20:02] that's the spirit follows it he turned
[20:05] from the world
[20:06] she practices that wasn't human but with
[20:09] a base hallelujah because we are God
[20:16] dealing with just brought about in the
[20:19] revelation of a desire a woman came to
[20:23] program with this she said brother I
[20:24] need what I would only go professor what
[20:28] is your desire
[20:29] he says the
[20:30] oh she's away you got happy because
[20:33] God's gonna deal with in his eye on you
[20:35] guys
[20:35] for him how do you know what you said
[20:37] brothers you never let me defend letting
[20:40] satanical but why do you think in a
[20:42] revelation of this mystery that we live
[20:44] in that we live here it always goes back
[20:47] to her when he got ready to open the
[20:49] book what they say he said eatable why
[20:53] this ain't about because you have a
[20:54] designer
[20:59] this is heavenly food but you notice in
[21:02] the same the private old eat the book
[21:05] about spiritual desire take Luke 17 it
[21:10] was the coming be the same temptation to
[21:14] find Jesus with people more than lovers
[21:19] of God Amen hear that what he says here
[21:25] so we realized really why because this
[21:28] is all that God is wanting to vindicate
[21:31] himself in a full word body and we
[21:34] preach the third pole and that word but
[21:36] let me finish this out on desire for a
[21:38] few minutes I'll either the word shall
[21:40] we begin to go around and I want you to
[21:42] notice it what God called Peter honey
[21:44] you know he said Peter who to me and
[21:46] said it I am Peter said out of Christ
[21:48] the Son of the Living God how did Jesus
[21:50] a flesh and blood never revealed this to
[21:52] you now you had to come a showdown that
[21:55] Peter would have a desire for God over
[21:58] everything that you said Peter did not
[22:00] go he denied God because God told him he
[22:03] would hey Peter
[22:05] it was constant all means we've had
[22:08] people to save you
[22:08] don't be too happy tonight because God's
[22:11] and it would be another word
[22:15] so we fire but she was testing Peter
[22:18] revelation I did told it low to decipher
[22:21] I did they rejected him and he walked
[22:24] away as st. john 6:66 and they turned
[22:26] away from the light having the desire
[22:28] they're going to be religious without
[22:30] the Holy Ghost and what did he say to
[22:33] Peter will you also go people say the
[22:36] same thing Jesus a Jesus yeah
[22:39] here we had to pray somebody
[22:42] it was either whom shall I go tell me
[22:46] would you let go saying the same thing
[22:48] Jesus say how the man should not live by
[22:51] bread alone whom shall I go that has the
[22:54] word he recognized his desire was not
[22:57] flesh and blood hit this island for the
[23:00] word people that what God tried to give
[23:03] by doing a design with tariffs on the
[23:06] word I love these I returned from the
[23:08] world but this bride right here our
[23:10] desire will be turned back to the word
[23:14] begin the little hero
[23:16] now you said bro jewel head look at this
[23:20] little girl you know writer or one of
[23:24] the things that I desire should be you
[23:29] know and when Reverend pretty rapture
[23:31] message we should have worn scroll
[23:34] desire of our food oh my wife of our
[23:38] life everything has to be second but
[23:41] this should be the desire and we plan on
[23:44] making a rapture just must be our desire
[23:46] and then looking at Psalm 27 and we
[23:49] heard when David say these words Psalms
[23:54] 27 I'm trying to find a knack in there

[31:31] you you didn't know until you heard the
[31:33] word and there was you know what he's
[31:36] never heard the word and the word would
[31:38] had God hey that was not some
[31:40] representation now you would have kept
[31:41] going on the way he was I would have
[31:43] kept going on the way and she wasn't
[31:45] kept living with the same husband she
[31:47] had look down and see that she had a
[31:55] desire Messiah come so she was looking
[32:01] for Purusha
[32:02] she was looking for something to take
[32:05] place when the Messiah come it was a
[32:08] revelation now before this before in
[32:11] other ways so she was trapped up with
[32:13] all this all this stuff all the filters
[32:16] of lifestyle she were living in and how
[32:18] many more was guilty and trapped up in
[32:20] this lifestyle but the Messiah we were
[32:22] looking for something to take play hello
[32:24] we were not even looking but it was a
[32:26] desire somewhere you always had a desire
[32:28] for God just let you see her so Jesus
[32:35] came down and he came down cuz she had a
[32:39] desire he came to the fire seized anyhow
[32:42] no desire
[32:43] they said you better get out of here you
[32:44] devil I have to see in the problem God
[32:47] manifested after people seen the Godhead
[32:49] explained I don't believe that thing why
[32:52] they don't believe it because the souls
[32:53] in prison
[32:54] turn down the guy you see it's better
[32:56] for somebody not to her dismiss it
[32:58] didn't come to it and say I believe in
[33:00] saw the devil you black see the Holy
[33:02] Spirit they know what the god help early
[33:07] made known the revelation and you know
[33:09] where you come from and know who you are
[33:11] hey you ain't got it call it a devil you
[33:13] miss
[33:13] nobody a lot of people boy a lot of
[33:17] people just messing up check on this
[33:20] answer he came to him in the time watch
[33:23] watching what was she receiving she
[33:26] received in the third world for him by a
[33:27] day the word was gonna be open to her
[33:30] you know would you show me anything
[33:32] differ from the word open the Hyundai
[33:34] open to you she recognized the Messiah
[33:36] we reckon out the word which is Christ
[33:38] the Messiah this day but manifest in the
[33:40] son of man ministry so what was the
[33:42] difference between all recognize him and
[33:43] then we recognize him she recognized him
[33:48] before he was in her we recognize him in
[33:51] us that's a different wiener she
[33:53] recognized him as the statue standing
[33:55] there talking to him in flood how do we
[33:57] and she's seen the word in front but we
[33:59] see the word behind skin we see the word
[34:01] in us and that day you should know that
[34:03] I am in the father and the father me how
[34:06] are you this is the day talking about
[34:14] the kingdom of God is in me now so she
[34:19] said sir she said he goes through gillis
[34:23] quickly on desire and what he says she
[34:27] died now watch what she was doing she
[34:30] was drawing water cuz she was thirsty
[34:34] she has a thirst and everybody got a
[34:37] thirst he goes you see today that the
[34:41] thought was around water with your body
[34:43] desires so she was doing something that
[34:46] the flesh body had a scroll his offer
[34:49] was water how Lucille Jesus says there's
[34:52] a woman give me a drink
[34:54] how do give me a drink and the woman
[34:57] looks at him and she says you have
[34:59] nothing to draw with the well is deep
[35:01] and we know the story begin to gold
[35:03] Jesus say if you know who I am he would
[35:06] ask me over drink and I would give you
[35:09] water that she wouldn't have to come
[35:11] here to draw no more but if she said she
[35:14] had a desire Lord give me this water
[35:17] I'll do people that what we trying to
[35:19] say when lord give me this water that i
[35:21] don't have to draw no more i like to
[35:23] pull from the world
[35:24] I know pause does Deluxe's at the front
[35:27] I didn't come from the fountain of the
[35:28] Living Word Helia
[35:32] did Jesus say at all so we begin to look
[35:36] at this story and they didn't see the
[35:38] message we cannot fall watch that she
[35:40] begin to do
[35:41] did she says Jesus I'm just kind of
[35:44] perforating it might be broke up a
[35:46] little bit but you get what my poor so
[35:48] they begin to talk and then they saying
[35:50] you know she believed let's talk about
[35:52] unnatural she says to Jesus
[35:55] she says you say I father Jacob build
[35:59] this wheel in other words and how far
[36:02] the drop with Missy forget it going here
[36:04] trying to explain why didn't she dragged
[36:07] him from there well of Jacob you know to
[36:10] see drop on the world of Jacob it never
[36:12] changed her design honey she drunk that
[36:15] well and she kept on living with us

[36:21] he'd never done nothing just knowing
[36:24] Jacob the Prophet honey

[36:55] Jean actually a question bird she said
[36:57] go get you husband go get your husband
[37:02] now she been you know I sent him ain't
[37:07] got none to hide so she said ain't gotta
[37:09] know me ain't nobody telling me what to
[37:12] do I do what I want to do just say you
[37:15] said true I've been glad with no mystery
[37:18] the way this so-called legal is the
[37:20] spirit running man
[37:21] you mean I better profit do you need to
[37:23] do that Jesus didn't do that because he
[37:26] wasn't worried about cleaning up before
[37:27] catching
[37:30] we try to Berkeley we say you better
[37:32] quit doing this you better quit doing it
[37:34] and we let alone out do it and she don't
[37:36] know nothing about God holiday we got
[37:38] people take off doesn't take off their
[37:40] head by six months they write back in
[37:42] the world why don't you paint Mac the
[37:44] world
[37:44] hey what's with him so he goes on here
[37:48] total he did go he didn't say answer the
[37:52] question he go get your husband Jesus
[37:57] are you saying true
[37:58] now what was he looking at he was
[38:01] looking at in her was a little teeny
[38:04] baby teeny tinkle we're called truth in
[38:09] other words you say brother truth will
[38:12] prevail over lying any day you know what
[38:15] so truth is what God looks at didn't
[38:17] even do it even in other words she told
[38:20] her truth and he were concerned he was
[38:22] not concerned about he was concerned
[38:23] about her because I need her let me
[38:26] respond it was true he said you have
[38:29] said truth and the one you got now is
[38:33] not your husband so when he did it
[38:35] something on the inside internal because
[38:38] she knew they would she knew the ignored
[38:40] that was beyond it was silent when he go
[38:42] she's good Lord we know when the Messiah
[38:44] come here dude either he open the third
[38:47] pour he broke the revelation girl she
[38:51] recognized the word in the flesh that's
[38:55] all that hold of this message man we
[38:58] don't made it so we don't explain it
[39:00] away
[39:00] we don't explain what it is when
[39:02] everyone you recognize went in the
[39:04] mirror when the word came to Mary Mary
[39:06] did not understand everything and Jesus
[39:10] could not impregnate Mary but she had a
[39:14] revelation of st. John 1:14 the word in
[39:20] the beginning was the word then the word
[39:21] would be made flesh he could not
[39:23] pregnant her she come to that revelation
[39:25] so if you noticed when he began to talk
[39:27] to Mary he being inside America he said
[39:29] Mary had highly favored among you been
[39:32] highly favored and Beiber's Beckett well
[39:34] I have a she didn't understand this
[39:36] neither did he say the second time we
[39:38] know industry
[39:39] marry he said you gonna have a child and
[39:41] they begin to tell it what gonna happen
[39:43] and then angle be called or something
[39:44] made out of what I marry looking at the
[39:46] stake of marrying and this is never
[39:48] happened before this has never happened
[39:50] before anybody tell you now they got
[39:53] pregnant it was I swear to God tell me
[39:55] telling Allah from him tell him to
[39:58] repent and get that a Duchess Dell offer
[40:00] them it ain't happenin home or like that
[40:02] I don't care how many priests a poke
[40:04] whatever we say I done this a virgin
[40:06] birth it is a lie how do that only
[40:09] happen one time now there's so did she
[40:12] go to here so she ain't never happened
[40:14] before so Mary takes the natural
[40:16] approach using the natural understanding
[40:19] where we alway proach God we always try
[40:22] to take the supernatural and make it
[40:24] natural right I'll do you know will
[40:25] become we trying to make it so William
[40:27] believe me but they're putting it the
[40:28] supernatural is not made for you to
[40:30] believe it with your own call of my
[40:32] supernatural may for you to believe
[40:33] about faith when it cannot even be
[40:35] explained but you know that God is real
[40:38] you can explain God he took my spiritual
[40:42] you like so anyway you know God he might
[40:45] personally make himself known to you you
[40:47] can't pick up a book he would pick up
[40:50] all the newspapers he'll pick up all
[40:52] liturgy you won't read about God but you
[40:54] would never know God until he make
[40:56] yourself personally known so Kingdom
[41:02] became doing he says praise gotta be
[41:05] some prison but in a way yeah right he
[41:10] came through so he had the meeting said
[41:11] Mary personally known to Mary
[41:13] so what did he do to marry American Mary
[41:17] says where's Lord everything you say but
[41:24] we got one problem I am still a virgin
[41:28] I don't even know a man so the what she
[41:33] was saying
[41:34] we're truth because that's the only way
[41:37] that she would know life to be made
[41:39] manifest has come through the union of a
[41:42] man and a woman so and it never happened
[41:44] before and it was so what are you doing
[41:46] here bringing the mystery by sickos
[41:49] not gonna be a physical unit because the
[41:51] first ball come to a physical union
[41:53] between the beast and a woman sort of
[41:54] second that restored man he had to come
[41:56] by like it was in the beginning through
[41:58] the spoken word
[41:59] I'm just something had already been
[42:00] smoking before mercy shall bruise so
[42:07] every time for that to be fulfilled
[42:09] mary says she still couldn't believe it
[42:14] it just it was just too mysterious and
[42:19] jesus seen it but see you don't get a
[42:21] new birth it confuse you a new Barbara
[42:25] is a clear understanding of the word of
[42:27] God today you come to a clear-cut
[42:30] understanding of the word of God so he
[42:33] had to say something married to get
[42:35] married let's stipulate her mind
[42:37] something that she know that was
[42:40] impossible but it was done in a way now
[42:43] you know I'm tell you what things can
[42:44] happen when you think it could happen
[42:47] anything we all believe that you know
[42:49] and there were things that happen to one
[42:51] good thing right now that you know the
[42:52] brush set don't look at all that why her
[42:54] guy's name what's her name
[42:58] get away now true but it would be what
[43:04] if God's sake but rich in you you want
[43:07] to have a baby y'all know where go buy
[43:09] your clothes I know we don't believe
[43:12] that y'all have to pray for me I mean we
[43:18] have a hard time too but if God tell
[43:20] them to get ready they're gonna have a
[43:22] child you might a county over it might
[43:25] not be you might get explain it I might
[43:27] get x-ray but if God say so you believe
[43:30] religion do you want one
[43:35] you go clean it you can see that already
[43:40] you can see you can see that you don't
[43:42] really know that but we can't
[43:46] believe it but in a way but anyway
[43:50] you've gotta say it what happened so
[43:52] what does God do he go to tell about
[43:53] Elizabeth Elizabeth it was the open
[43:59] heart and stagnant don't receive the
[44:01] word same flesh wendy was hit was over
[44:05] there was she seen this
[44:06] she said he none too hard for God being
[44:10] under me Lord
[44:11] according to thy word and what was it
[44:14] Saint John 1:14 was in the stomach
[44:16] that's all it was st. John 14 was in her
[44:18] stomach the word was being made flesh
[44:20] God was coming in his word body
[44:23] shall we begin to realize here so having
[44:26] this way we find her day every time
[44:28] things happen it was always a word how
[44:30] do you never work and now that's what
[44:32] the of Revelation is the day is
[44:34] that we trying to get back to what we
[44:36] fell from we dispel our bodies and fail
[44:40] all creation is little groaning waiting
[44:46] you say what's going on now
[44:48] the world is falling apart birth pains
[44:52] is on the world everything happening
[44:55] sonica more the spirit of solomon is
[44:58] raising up to piss the payors and
[45:01] accepting it everything you know Loretta
[45:03] Souter let all the church world say
[45:05] everybody's alright they let Saleh me be
[45:08] made known to the world that they are
[45:10] accepted now they I don't we're not
[45:12] turning down people we are turning our
[45:14] spirit you show me what Jesus said it
[45:17] won't be one up in that holy city but
[45:22] the world is in that condition and when
[45:24] the world was in that condition
[45:26] Abraham were met the word cars standing
[45:30] in a body revealing the mysteries to
[45:33] Abraham the secret of the body change I
[45:36] don't hear anybody you and your wife
[45:38] will receive a baby I don't even have
[45:40] wag about no aim ahead with you all ever
[45:41] baby sighs no even true
[45:45] hallelujah everybody around him know
[45:47] there was jewel but when God said you're
[45:50] gonna have something you have something
[45:51] honey but God sure the type of a change
[45:55] of the body right before he burns
[45:57] Solomon he changed them back to young

[51:54] and the word I believe that anybody
[51:56] could be chained we I believe that
[51:57] you've you see the whole ego God give
[51:59] you a new nature and I don't believe
[52:01] that God makes the species he say God
[52:03] don't make a pig
[52:05] he don't make a legal pig or she was a
[52:09] big dick cheney dude she he said he
[52:11] always wasn't she
[52:12] honey if you were made a man you ain't
[52:14] gonna be changed you always was a man
[52:18] now I don't care what nature that way
[52:20] sighs saying doctor say that is a lot
[52:23] from hell
[52:24] God ain't got no God Oh make no mistakes
[52:26] if God made you a man he made you a man
[52:29] I lead underwear he'd give you the
[52:31] designer man and he said when you see a
[52:32] man don't have that design something is
[52:35] wrong with development the Bible doesn't
[52:42] say where it is
[52:43] so do you know in other words they can
[52:45] get mad they can spin all the way want
[52:47] to but then they go change got word and
[52:51] it works a weed at work so but realize
[52:53] here but the bride recognized her place
[52:55] and they begin to run out who they are
[52:58] and begin to manifest the attributes to
[53:02] be burned
[53:02] tell me Father become because they was
[53:05] manifesting the attributes of sodomy and
[53:08] what did he set the fire and this
[53:09] consumed the whole city
[53:11] how did endeavor go get ready not the
[53:13] city the stuff he gonna consume
[53:14] everything that who name is not found
[53:17] written in the book how do so in other
[53:19] words everything they're not found in
[53:21] the book we hope because soon they're
[53:22] gonna be people's gonna be good people
[53:24] and if good people's a new denomination
[53:25] and it'll be a lot of them god it's
[53:27] gonna take a stand so we don't want to
[53:32] know you've got genuine peoples in there
[53:36] that believe God even though they might
[53:38] have to go through tribulation in the
[53:39] world but they take a stand for grace
[53:41] right we gotta bleed that way so we're
[53:46] gonna look it on someone get ready to
[53:48] wine down so I told you it was gonna be
[53:50] long but I just want to say these things
[53:52] because we realized here that this
[53:54] revelation come for one person one
[53:55] purpose in us he said in Christ mister
[53:58] God revealed he said with just great
[54:00] revelation was revealed mysteries made
[54:02] known to to you and you denounced all
[54:05] the things of the world why because your
[54:09] desire to change what we don't do what
[54:12] the world do you didn't do this is
[54:14] because the revelation in you you just
[54:17] have no desire

[59:03] eternal so in other words I say you know
[59:05] right when we eat dinner and it was it's
[59:07] all life honey just keep eating and
[59:10] living and eating and living and eating
[59:12] and living that's the kind of body that
[59:13] we're trying to get back to a desire to
[59:15] eat and live forever how little work
[59:18] that's not the most desirable thing that
[59:20] men love is eating now when you fool you
[59:25] pretty good get hungry try down the road
[59:29] for two hours and you ain't at nothing
[59:30] and you look up on that billboard you

[59:58] 120 pounds wet but he got an appetite
[1:00:02] good I looked at that plate I said man I
[1:00:05] saw even you I'm heat went back to the
[1:00:10] desert to everybody man I said he was
[1:00:18] already in the Mullaney
[1:00:21] we tried to watch what we we're trying
[1:00:24] to reel out here you know what am i
[1:00:27] eating I grow a little more I just ain't
[1:00:29] growing taller but the point of it is
[1:00:31] I'm never sitting there looking at this
[1:00:33] guy I'm saying how much he was putting
[1:00:34] down I'm wall I look at him I said man
[1:00:37] you one blessed guy with a hit off
[1:00:40] healthy tapeworm
[1:00:42] I just told her that you blessed to be
[1:00:45] that way but God let us get a desire and
[1:00:50] what we start eating now go to the Word
[1:00:53] of God we eaten off the book eaten the
[1:00:56] Word of God together created a desire to
[1:00:59] eat that why I said read your Bible that
[1:01:02] is not just an accident he said that he
[1:01:05] said how can I get closer to God because
[1:01:07] the more you read it is more you created
[1:01:09] a desire to eat some spiritual food
[1:01:11] that's it just it just didn't work don't
[1:01:14] worry if you don't read it you know the
[1:01:16] heaven he said he that would not win
[1:01:18] which one of feasible but you beat it
[1:01:21] defeated spiritual day he's gonna get
[1:01:23] spiritually and it's gonna get stronger
[1:01:25] if you feed it a bunch of tommyrot off
[1:01:27] the news I got more news preaching I do
[1:01:32] too by the word and we're not gonna go
[1:01:35] change the condition of the world other
[1:01:37] because it's under curse and we know
[1:01:39] that ever said 19 in 50 said I don't get
[1:01:42] what we do leave a raise up every jaw
[1:01:43] washer everything it will not change
[1:01:46] don't the condition of the world so that
[1:01:49] way I got to be birth would you bet we
[1:01:50] gonna change about all people said we go
[1:01:52] looking for the day but everybody
[1:01:54] getting along
[1:01:55] yeah you will at the Mullaney you won't
[1:01:58] have another day like that into the
[1:01:59] plane but all this junk that we hear all
[1:02:02] that just listening to politics stuff
[1:02:04] and actually becoming greater and more
[1:02:07] designed for politics and all the wood
[1:02:09] cut me rather the work of the world they
[1:02:11] may is preaching the Word of God trying
[1:02:13] to get their people starts by so clear I
[1:02:15] ain't got time for this stuff let my
[1:02:20] word be true true feels like details and
[1:02:27] people dumb enough to believe it in the
[1:02:29] message they say this is gonna happen he
[1:02:33] said just clap what you two were saying
[1:02:34] whoever the word said gonna be like song
[1:02:36] come on he won't burn it so I don't need
[1:02:39] no science to tell me that I don't need
[1:02:40] o news until why do you do what they're
[1:02:42] doing ain't doing what they're doing
[1:02:44] because the Bible predict and privacy
[1:02:46] that this is what's gonna happen before
[1:02:48] we get out of here
[1:02:50] so we might well look up stand looking
[1:02:52] around every musicians car
[1:02:55] god bless you maybe they say they don't
[1:03:06] get open the eyes of my heart Lord
[1:03:09] that's the only way we're gonna see God
[1:03:12] and the only way we're gonna see God
[1:03:14] we're gonna have to get a thirst for God
[1:03:16] hallelujah we gotta get a thirst for God
