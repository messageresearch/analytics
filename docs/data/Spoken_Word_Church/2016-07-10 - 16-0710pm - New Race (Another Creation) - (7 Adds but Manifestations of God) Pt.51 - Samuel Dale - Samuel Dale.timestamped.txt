[22:49] the lady oans WR these things sayith the
[22:52] amen the faithful and true witness the
[22:55] beginning of the creation of God all
[22:58] right now we go over to Second Peter
[23:02] 1 Simon Peter servant and Apostle of
[23:05] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[23:08] like Precious Faith with us through the
[23:10] righteousness of God and our Savior
[23:12] Jesus
[23:13] Christ Grace and peace be multiplied
[23:16] unto you through the knowledge of God
[23:19] and of Jesus our lord according as his
[23:22] divine
[23:23] power hath given unto all things all
[23:27] things that pertain into life and
[23:28] godliness through the knowledge of him
[23:30] now watch it's through the knowledge or
[23:32] revelation of him that has called us to
[23:36] glory and virtue whereby are given to us
[23:38] exceeding great and precious promises
[23:41] that by these you might be partakers of
[23:43] the divine nature having escaped the
[23:46] corruption that is in the world through
[23:47] lust and besides this besides escaping
[23:50] it besides coming into the
[23:52] body all beside this giv all diligence
[23:58] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[24:01] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[24:03] and to Temperance patience and to
[24:04] patience godliness and to Godliness
[24:07] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[24:10] kindness charity or
[24:12] love for if these things be in you and
[24:15] abound they make you that you shall
[24:16] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[24:20] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you
[24:23] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[24:25] to the reading of the word
[24:30] now not to uh back up into this morning
[24:35] much but to um make sure you follow
[24:40] our thought pattern of what we're
[24:43] talking about so that it will go right
[24:45] on
[24:46] into uh this message this afternoon we
[24:51] were talking
[24:52] about looking at the Statue of a perfect
[24:55] man and looking at
[24:56] things and remember now your Prophet
[24:59] said it I didn't he said if you don't
[25:01] understand your
[25:03] mathematics of the Bible that you're
[25:05] missing it all right so he'll give the
[25:08] numbers
[25:10] three and he'll say that's like father
[25:13] son Holy Ghost is perfection you know
[25:15] think he'll even use seven is completion
[25:18] seven is perfection uh 12 is worship he
[25:22] said if you don't understand the
[25:24] mathematical parts of your Bible he said
[25:26] then you'll miss it and you'll get the
[25:28] wrong thing onto the wrong place so I'm
[25:32] not a
[25:33] mathematician but the the Bible is
[25:36] perfect in it being revealed that's
[25:39] right about the mathematics now not to
[25:42] just look at it and well I found this
[25:44] you know there's people that argue in
[25:46] the message you know over the fact of a
[25:48] number four being an antichrist number
[25:50] well that's true it is it's an
[25:52] antichrist number you know uh youve
[25:55] coming down to your uh false prophet and
[25:57] things you know and bees and come out to
[25:59] four but remember it's also a number for
[26:03] restoration justification sanation
[26:05] baptism Holy Ghost and reveal word see
[26:08] so it's whatever you're using it
[26:10] for and you're not using mathematics to
[26:13] just show how smart you are
[26:16] mathematically because you will miss it
[26:18] that way but to speak about the things
[26:21] of God to come out to the right numbers
[26:24] and all and I if you if you miss
[26:26] anything in the message remember one
[26:28] thing we cannot bring any
[26:32] thought through the word now
[26:35] listen you can't bring any thought
[26:38] through the word of God and stop on a
[26:40] number
[26:41] seven if that's as far as you can go is
[26:44] a number
[26:47] seven you do not have eternal life that
[26:50] you're talking
[26:51] about if you stop on the number seven
[26:54] right your Prophet said it's the
[26:56] Millennium is even still under time
[26:58] right the Millennium is still under the
[27:00] number seven
[27:01] am amen so then you know you can't do it
[27:05] you got to bring it to a number eight to
[27:09] bring it to Eternity to to break make it
[27:13] work sevens are great because they are
[27:16] for the time right all right but then
[27:19] you got to take it to a number eight for
[27:22] your understanding and all but remember
[27:25] now uh like Wade was bringing out on the
[27:29] the message there of the Daniel 70 week
[27:32] see Israel never celebrated the
[27:34] 50th
[27:38] Jubilee they didn't celebrate anything
[27:40] hardly because they were in captivity
[27:42] most of the time and they couldn't
[27:44] celebrate other than their own little
[27:46] household celebration but see there's
[27:49] got to be something for Israel to take
[27:51] her to that part all right now keep that
[27:56] in mind because that'll be the point
[27:57] want to be dealing with now remember
[28:00] what we were talking about this
[28:02] morning we were talking about the the
[28:06] pyramid and looking back at the pyramid
[28:09] and we we look at it and I asked you the
[28:11] question the other day why would brother
[28:14] brandham put Holy Spirit here when it
[28:18] doesn't list it that way in the
[28:21] Bible it says faith virtue knowledge
[28:24] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[28:27] kindness
[28:28] and
[28:29] love but yet he put the emphasis on it
[28:32] to bring it to show in the Holy Spirit
[28:35] and that's perfect it was right so you
[28:38] know he he was emphasizing to me the
[28:42] point of bringing it to a great
[28:45] Revelation and I hope you followed it
[28:47] this morning in our little drawing our
[28:50] little illustration and we'll read
[28:52] another quote or two so if you will
[28:54] Brothers pull up the one with the first
[28:56] one with the kind of dots in it and
[28:59] things and let's look at it
[29:01] because I as One True Believer I believe
[29:04] in the Seal of God Amen and I believe
[29:07] when you're born again at
[29:11] Faith at Faith you are sealed in right
[29:14] Amen to the body of Christ can never be
[29:18] taken out can't be removed there's no
[29:21] way nothing can remove the person that's
[29:24] sealed by the Holy Spirit that's right
[29:26] all right amen but then that doesn't
[29:29] give you everything into
[29:32] manifestation it doesn't give you
[29:34] anything to bring into life you know the
[29:38] point it gives you eternal life all
[29:41] right but yet it needs these things and
[29:44] we are required to have these
[29:48] virtues all right that is not my
[29:50] thoughts that's your Prophet these are
[29:52] required virtue knowledge Temperance
[29:54] patience godliness all that is required
[29:57] of you and I now especially this
[30:01] age because this is the age that they're
[30:04] going to be very vital to understand
[30:08] these things about these virtues because
[30:12] the prophet of God said talking of the
[30:15] ages and he's talking about the
[30:17] messengers and the ages and the Seven
[30:20] Church ages that's in your uh statue of
[30:23] a perfect man and he said as he brings
[30:25] the church then he will bring bring the
[30:28] individuals or individual to bring the
[30:30] church all right and see then if he
[30:34] bring in the church you know as a whole
[30:37] a unit will come up and there will be a
[30:40] Rapture he
[30:41] said and he said with these things here
[30:44] in the ages it'll bring a church a bride
[30:47] to a Rapture and he said in these
[30:50] virtues you remember reading that these
[30:54] virtues brings the person to the place
[30:57] place to be raptured am all right now so
[31:02] then it's very vital to understand it's
[31:05] a necessity so you say what's going to
[31:07] be the Rapture brother
[31:10] Dale these virtues that's
[31:14] right now you tell me something else
[31:17] irregardless of what you want to count
[31:19] it to be of this or that or the other or
[31:20] whatever you want a call to go with it
[31:23] it would have to still come back to
[31:24] being these virtues brought in to an
[31:28] individual we'll bring that individual
[31:31] and count that individual
[31:34] off and that will be a living moving
[31:39] Idol of God or instrumentality of God
[31:42] all right and the church ages with these
[31:44] virtues would come to a place to bring
[31:46] it down to a change of the body all
[31:51] right so now the holy spirit is your
[31:55] seal but now notice brother Adam wrote
[31:57] Holy Spirit between there that you know
[32:00] that I remember thinking on that I
[32:03] preached this many many years ago and
[32:04] many many times so it's not a new thing
[32:07] or a
[32:08] thought but I remember when I first
[32:10] begin to look at those things and look
[32:12] at it and say well you
[32:15] know there's some reason
[32:18] there there's some reason why he would
[32:21] write Holy Spirit and draw it out that
[32:24] way because remember he's the prophet
[32:28] all and he would he made the draw in the
[32:30] way he wanted it all right and we can't
[32:33] question why he would make those
[32:36] things all right cuz come on listen look
[32:39] behind me and read it pull it back up on
[32:41] there where you can read it and and just
[32:43] you know where they can can see it you
[32:46] see look Faith virtue knowledge temper
[32:48] Fai God his brother kind Holy Spirit it
[32:52] doesn't list Holy Spirit in the
[32:56] Bible the prophet told you what it was
[32:59] he told you what's going to seal
[33:04] it what's going to seal these
[33:07] virtues is the Holy
[33:10] Spirit and he's not making two people
[33:13] out of it so in a minute we'll read it
[33:16] God coming down through Christ Holy
[33:19] Spirit seals these things into you
[33:22] that's
[33:24] right see he's right then he knew what
[33:27] was
[33:28] doing he was telling
[33:30] us what would bring us to eternal
[33:36] life all right see then you don't have
[33:39] to take that out because if you're
[33:41] counting you got one two 3 5 6 7 8
[33:51] n you say well what no don't take it out
[33:54] just let this and this all be become one
[33:57] and let all of this become
[34:00] one as the Seal of
[34:04] God then you only have the eight
[34:09] things right see then you have faith
[34:12] knowledge temp Pati God and the love of
[34:15] God which is a whole thing all right so
[34:18] it's was emphasizing it when you use you
[34:21] get to New Birth see this line
[34:24] solid this is still J rip down
[34:27] there all right now bring it on up for
[34:30] another point to seal this one in see
[34:32] when he seal that in it's sealed
[34:35] in you say well brother brother I'm
[34:38] right up
[34:40] here well what about this down
[34:44] here I don't know about that but I'm up
[34:46] in
[34:47] here well now I wouldn't have want that
[34:50] said it you read it I've got them laying
[34:51] here or they're laying in the office
[34:53] brother Brandon says it'll crumble
[34:58] if it ain't sealed in it'll crumble so
[35:01] you say well I'm sealed in Brother D
[35:03] right up here is where I'm sealed in
[35:05] this is the individual this is not the
[35:07] age that's right all right see you say
[35:10] well I'm sealed in here and then you got
[35:12] problems in between here these could
[35:13] even be sealed in here but you got a
[35:16] problems in between that it can
[35:18] crumble amen so why not do it the way
[35:21] the prophet does just in the in the
[35:23] Bible does it add to your faith virtue
[35:28] it didn't say it into brotherly kindness
[35:30] and it says faith virtue knowledge each
[35:35] one coming up if you went down to a
[35:39] certain uh group of people today they
[35:43] call that a starcase
[35:45] lecture do you know that there's a
[35:49] a group that uses that right there and
[35:51] they call it a staircase
[35:55] lecture
[35:58] don't throw off on nobody they got some
[36:01] good
[36:01] points you but listen see as each one
[36:05] comes forth and sealed in there's no way
[36:08] to you take that out you might think
[36:10] you're up in here and crumble back but
[36:12] you're only going to go to where the
[36:13] seal is so let that seal keep coming up
[36:17] so just going up through there Brothers
[36:19] you got it see each one is just sealed
[36:21] in there's no way to take that out now
[36:24] sealed in but watch the point now that I
[36:26] didn't get to this morning bring it on
[36:28] up
[36:30] okay now you got that sealed
[36:35] in there's no way for any of this to be
[36:39] taken
[36:39] out but you do have one thing that's got
[36:43] to be
[36:44] done you got to finish this part up to
[36:48] where you can't take nothing out of it
[36:51] you know how you build up things and you
[36:53] bring it
[36:54] up and you leave little flange the
[36:56] prophet spoke of blasphemian n or rock
[36:59] box and then you set this top he said
[37:02] it's not just a platform cuz you set the
[37:04] platform across you can take out but
[37:07] once that top is set down on that church
[37:11] there's no way to get nothing out of
[37:13] here that is Christ amen the
[37:17] manifestation
[37:19] amen that is
[37:21] him living in you and
[37:24] me all we got to do is just not try to
[37:26] go up or down just fill in the sides
[37:30] with your rock box that your sister
[37:31] spoke of in her
[37:33] dream that would come up into here and
[37:37] go over and then this comes down into
[37:39] here and then you don't move them just
[37:41] leave them right there just draw in the
[37:43] sides line all right now we'll you say
[37:47] well is that true okay let's read it
[37:49] okay we're going back to this morning
[37:51] and get these two or three out of the
[37:53] way then we'll continue on cuz I know
[37:56] that I will will not complete this
[37:58] message this afternoon it will be have
[38:02] to be into
[38:03] Wednesday possibly even next Sunday but
[38:07] see here's the thing that I wanted the
[38:09] points I wanted to read go back to
[38:11] number I gave you those Brothers 1 2 3
[38:14] 4 go back to the number
[38:17] one okay which is paragraph 140 141 of
[38:21] the stature of a perfect man now look
[38:23] what he says that Big Stone come by
[38:26] picked it up that big maget Stone picked
[38:30] it up you remember now you remember this
[38:32] morning I quoted it brother BR says we
[38:34] got to be magnetized to The
[38:38] Headstone not just stuck or anything the
[38:41] cement not just the cement to put on
[38:43] something each one becomes vulcanized to
[38:47] the other
[38:48] one all right then when you do look what
[38:51] you got we got to be magnetized to that
[38:55] headstone
[38:57] that headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ
[39:01] and every one of us has got the
[39:02] magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that
[39:05] stone strikes the image the church will
[39:07] flee to it back into Glory she'll be
[39:10] taken up in the Rapture of the Saints
[39:13] When She Goes Forth through that day all
[39:15] right now we got to be magnetized to it
[39:20] all of it's got to be stuck together all
[39:22] of it's got to be the same material you
[39:25] don't add Rubber and metal you can't
[39:27] vulcanize that we know the old
[39:29] vulcanized patch we used to put on the
[39:32] tubes it was burnt together to you that
[39:36] don't know anything about it it was
[39:37] burnt together and then each the the
[39:40] tube and the patch would become
[39:43] bonded which meant they were of the same
[39:46] material and the heat just bonded them
[39:48] together well all the heat the devil can
[39:51] put on you and I all he's doing is just
[39:53] bonding us more to God that's right
[39:57] right let him pour it
[40:00] on brother R said the church always does
[40:03] better what under
[40:06] persecution but see you mention
[40:08] persecution well you think he going
[40:09] through the tribulation I didn't say
[40:11] that your Prophet has said we don't go
[40:13] through the
[40:14] tribulation but we do have
[40:17] persecution right all right now watch
[40:20] let's go on to the next one then this is
[40:22] from Blasphemous 's
[40:24] paragraph uh let's see what
[40:27] I may have give it to you on the
[40:28] opposite do it that's okay we'll use
[40:31] that this is
[40:33] three
[40:35] 20
[40:36] 39 329 okay said right in there
[40:42] listen watch him as he brings it
[40:44] forth right in here right in here you
[40:47] see I got it between all these Works in
[40:50] here he's talking about the virtues
[40:52] right and here are these little waves
[40:55] comes you remember the sister the water
[40:57] was washing down in the waves what is
[41:00] that the holy ghost coming down through
[41:06] Christ see Holy Spirit the holy spirit
[41:09] is above all this watch
[41:14] it no wonder he put it there the Holy
[41:17] Spirit read the quote
[41:19] now the holy spirit is above all this
[41:24] watch welding the
[41:26] together building a
[41:32] what you say well that's all of it it's
[41:35] just the Holy Ghost that's coming you
[41:37] didn't
[41:38] read building what a perfect church for
[41:42] the Capstone to cap it
[41:47] off now you see why you got Holy Spirit
[41:49] written in
[41:52] there see he's right holy spirit
[41:57] amen Christ coming down the holy ghost
[41:59] coming down through Christ on your
[42:02] pyramid one coming down through the
[42:04] other see but not being two Gods this is
[42:07] all magnetized remember I told you this
[42:11] morning we are all magnetized To The
[42:14] Head and the head is what's pulling you
[42:17] right ever born again
[42:20] believer ever born again believer is
[42:24] being pulled upward I read you're being
[42:26] pulled downward right right right ever
[42:31] born again believer it don't matter
[42:32] whether you think they're United to it
[42:34] or what it's pulling
[42:36] you the day you was born again it
[42:39] started pulling you
[42:42] upward right
[42:44] amen Christ leading us but look he's
[42:49] welding us to Holy Spirit welding it
[42:51] together a perfect
[42:53] church for the Capstone to cap it
[42:58] off he's not making it two different
[43:00] things love is the seal amen but the
[43:04] holy spirit is the
[43:06] seal Love Is The
[43:12] Virtue the holy spirit is not a
[43:17] virtue or it would have been listed as a
[43:23] virtue the prophet is showing you how it
[43:26] seals
[43:28] in now watch it love is a
[43:34] virtue what do you love is a virtue it
[43:37] is all the
[43:40] virtues are you with
[43:43] me the Capstone is all the
[43:46] virtues on a regular pyramid pull the
[43:48] pyramid
[43:50] up and you'll see what I'm talking about
[43:52] cuz we talked about this many many times
[43:55] before if it's draw correctly and built
[43:58] correctly that stone will fit right
[44:04] here
[44:05] right you understand what I said if it's
[44:08] drawn the way that it's built this Stone
[44:11] will fit right here it also fit right
[44:14] over
[44:16] there in this
[44:20] headstone is
[44:22] all the virtues of almighty God
[44:28] right because it's love and that's what
[44:30] he is right can't you see then what's
[44:34] pulling you yes
[44:37] am if all of the virtues are
[44:40] here all of these virtues would be up
[44:43] there pulling you but this is me and you
[44:46] coming up this way we got to come slow
[44:49] and
[44:50] gradual
[44:52] right but in him is everything all right
[44:57] now do you understand why I said it the
[44:58] way I did this morning
[45:00] then we're sealed
[45:04] in by the baptism of the Holy
[45:06] Ghost to give us a new
[45:09] birth but then as each virtue is brought
[45:13] forth and the Holy Spirit seals it in
[45:16] and remember he ain't going to seal it
[45:18] in until he knows it's
[45:19] right you right see that's why we with
[45:23] those yarded lines I had it so you can
[45:25] come up to here and you can get from up
[45:27] into
[45:29] here why would your Prophet come in the
[45:32] message and say godliness and said look
[45:36] said you come all this way until God
[45:39] expects you he don't expect you to be
[45:40] perfect till you come up to here you
[45:43] remember that the other week
[45:46] I read the stature of a perfect
[45:50] man study it
[45:54] amen think about it of what it's being
[45:57] said well I'm I'm in the message you
[45:59] ain't in the message if you don't know
[46:01] what the messenger talk what message you
[46:03] talking about the only way you can be in
[46:05] the message is for the message to be in
[46:08] you
[46:11] right but see then as each one of these
[46:14] is brought into US is tempering it
[46:17] together sealing it together just don't
[46:19] try to lower the headstone CU you'd be
[46:22] fitting right there that's
[46:24] right
[46:26] leave it where it's at right and let the
[46:29] Holy Ghost that's here in this part that
[46:32] we' call Christ just fill in the sides
[46:36] and join together let Christ and man
[46:39] become
[46:42] one that's right what did he say in
[46:45] blasphemia name he said no
[46:48] wonder the Holy Ghost has not been
[46:51] taught correctly he
[46:53] said right right
[46:59] but see when we and the Holy Ghost
[47:00] become
[47:03] one there's our
[47:05] problem we don't think that can ever
[47:13] be
[47:15] right well in a way now I guess you
[47:17] could say the Bride In Christ are one
[47:19] with that that ain't in the Bible that's
[47:22] right you got that out of gre's Almanac
[47:25] or somewhere
[47:26] off of Facebook you didn't get it
[47:28] reading the
[47:31] Bible you know what I mean Facebook
[47:33] somebody else is
[47:36] gabbing and get okay you know we're not
[47:40] perfect like I said the other day this
[47:42] book bumper sticker I'm not perfect I'm
[47:46] just
[47:47] forgiven if you're forgiven you never
[47:49] done it right come on in God if you're
[47:53] forgiven you never done it well if you
[47:56] never done it you can't be counted
[47:59] guilty you're
[48:02] perfect we better get down to studying
[48:04] how to make us be not guilty that's
[48:07] right now I only know one way to be not
[48:13] guilty because there ain't nobody and I
[48:16] ain't going to stand up here and tell
[48:18] you and I can read from Brother brandom
[48:20] anything you want on that very point
[48:23] where you're talking about be therefore
[48:24] perfect he said do we sin he said every
[48:29] day so now he's not
[48:32] saying if you ever notied one
[48:35] scripture and I know it's going to hit
[48:37] you hard but you know that Jesus was the
[48:39] one that said there's none good no not
[48:46] one come on he's the one who said it he
[48:49] said there's none good no not
[48:52] one you say are you trying to say Jesus
[48:55] were sinful no I'm saying he was a
[48:59] man I'm saying he was a
[49:02] man and that
[49:05] problems
[49:06] right come on Church get with it it's
[49:11] time to either get it or get out of it
[49:13] cuz we're running out of
[49:15] time right
[49:18] feely out of
[49:20] time okay but look now think about
[49:24] it
[49:26] all of these virtues then are of the
[49:28] same
[49:31] material right and they can be
[49:34] vulcanized
[49:35] together and they're are all the same
[49:38] that they can be magnetic you know
[49:41] magnetism we read it this
[49:44] morning all
[49:45] right that headstone is the Holy Ghost
[49:49] and every one of us that's got the
[49:52] magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that
[49:54] stone strikes the image the church will
[49:58] flee to it back into the glory we read
[50:00] it just a minute
[50:03] ago taken from what the 70th week of
[50:07] Daniel we got to be magnetized to The
[50:11] Headstone now how are you
[50:13] magnetized to The
[50:16] Headstone it's got to be the same
[50:18] material that's
[50:22] right so you can go through and figure
[50:24] out all these things everything else and
[50:26] you're going to miss the point of what
[50:28] because that's what people would do they
[50:29] sit and figure out everything while
[50:31] you're talking and they don't realize
[50:33] what you're saying they missed the whole
[50:36] point all right but
[50:39] listen if it's all the same
[50:44] material it can be vulcanized
[50:47] together so it's his faith his virtue
[50:51] his knowledge Temperance patience Godly
[50:53] brotherly kindness and love right
[50:56] It All Belongs to him given unto you
[51:00] amen and to bring you forth
[51:03] into what you're supposed to
[51:06] be the prophet said on the statute of a
[51:09] perfect man paragraph
[51:11] 142 have
[51:13] faith and be born
[51:17] again add to your
[51:21] faith
[51:23] virtue right
[51:26] add to your faith virtue y all right
[51:30] now I've been saying it over and over so
[51:33] you already to know what I'm going to
[51:34] say faith is not a
[51:39] virtue it doesn't
[51:42] say add
[51:44] Faith it's the prophet explains it that
[51:48] Peter is saying those of light precious
[51:51] Faith have faith and be born
[51:54] again there's your new birth there's
[51:57] your sealed in to the body of Christ all
[52:01] right because it's his faith all
[52:05] right but faith is not a
[52:11] virtue it is Christ himself that's right
[52:15] all right but then you add virture
[52:18] knowledge temper fa is
[52:20] godliness and when you do you come out
[52:23] to the right one
[52:26] cuz then you add to your faith virtue
[52:30] and The Virtue
[52:32] knowledge remember how it
[52:35] was and watch him now go ahead and pull
[52:39] this up cuz that's the point we're going
[52:40] to start from pull up number
[52:45] four which is paragraph
[52:48] 65 of blasphemian 9es first
[52:52] fundamentally excuse me first
[52:54] foundationally and he said is Faith
[52:58] second add to your faith virtue and your
[53:02] virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance
[53:03] from Temperance to patience patience to
[53:06] Godliness godliness Brotherly Love
[53:08] brotherly kindness and then love being
[53:11] the Capstone
[53:13] seven of those
[53:23] things are you
[53:26] reading he just named
[53:34] eight did you count
[53:39] it face secondly Fai he's not two fath
[53:43] now Faith virtue
[53:47] knowledge
[53:49] Temperance
[53:51] patience godliness brotherly love you're
[53:55] not repeating the thing and in
[53:59] love being in the
[54:01] hedone that's seven things he
[54:09] says why is
[54:12] it look at your
[54:14] pyramid draw the pyramid back up because
[54:16] it's easier to see this one than it is
[54:18] back in the
[54:20] corner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[54:27] eight that's
[54:31] right well I don't think we need to know
[54:34] this you've been 50 years listening to
[54:37] blabber
[54:38] mouse that don't know what they're
[54:40] talking about that's
[54:45] right you could at least sit down and W
[54:47] listen just a little
[54:51] bit and say why what why are these
[54:54] things
[54:57] all right we haven't taken out the Holy
[54:59] Spirit we've made the Holy Spirit the
[55:01] whole thing so then it's not nine things
[55:05] by counting the holy
[55:07] spirit is eight
[55:11] things but what is the man talking
[55:15] about he goes on to the message the
[55:19] statue of perfect man and he's bringing
[55:21] down and naming these he said seven
[55:25] things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[55:29] then the love of
[55:32] God keep it down under there okay CU
[55:35] we're going to need that more than we
[55:36] need this part up here pull it back to
[55:38] the
[55:41] pyramid go remember
[55:45] now he says there's seven things seven
[55:54] what
[55:56] if faith is not an ad you got one add
[56:00] two add three add four five add six
[56:02] eight
[56:06] seven seven
[56:09] things go face not an
[56:14] ad you got seven
[56:17] ads well oh well let's just prove this
[56:21] pull it back to number six now we're
[56:24] going to flip-flop between those two so
[56:26] keep your finger on the button Brother
[56:29] Anderson look on the message God's only
[56:32] provided place of worship 1965
[56:35] 1128 and look what he
[56:39] says coming down but the headstone was
[56:42] rejected messenger John the Baptist
[56:44] introduc the king but the headstone was
[56:45] rejected and they don't know the stone
[56:48] of scrone or whatever it is they don't
[56:50] know where it's at because it's a
[56:52] rejected Stone but that's the stone
[56:55] that caps the whole thing that makes it
[56:59] the pyramid through the complete seven
[57:03] Church
[57:06] ages adding Grace adding this adding
[57:10] this and there are seven
[57:13] ads the last one is
[57:21] Christ so there's seven ads
[57:25] virtue faith is not an ad that's right
[57:28] that's a
[57:30] birth so you going to catch it in the
[57:32] minute why I said that while ago when
[57:34] you come to that headstone it's got
[57:35] everything in it but it's an
[57:39] ad why because it's never been here in
[57:43] nobody
[57:44] but two
[57:48] people the Lord Jesus had it I believe
[57:51] brother brandom had that
[57:53] headstone I don't believe he he could
[57:55] have told us about it if he didn't have
[57:58] it
[58:00] right right I believe that see I put it
[58:04] in the place that I believe
[58:06] it because Peter couldn't tell you how
[58:08] to come up the statue of perfect man if
[58:10] he didn't have it right amen you know
[58:13] what brother Brown said it took him to
[58:14] get to where he could preach statute for
[58:16] man 33
[58:21] years and what did he say on that he
[58:23] said I just got the other the day how
[58:25] this ties in right
[58:28] here to something I was going to preach
[58:31] go back to the old message of this 56 uh
[58:35] intervail was the old title and look and
[58:38] see if he wasn't talking about a living
[58:41] moving
[58:43] instrumentality of God walking in
[58:49] you but he didn't know about these
[58:52] things here he said
[58:55] so he must have grow in Grace and
[58:58] knowledge but now he says there's seven
[59:03] ads and
[59:06] Christ being the seventh
[59:10] one so let's read one
[59:14] more cuz these two is vital to the point
[59:16] let's read number
[59:18] seven which is is this the sign of the
[59:21] end
[59:23] sir the the Holy Spirit kept off the
[59:25] individual and sealed it when we added
[59:28] to our faith righteousness and godliness
[59:30] faith and so forth and kept adding to it
[59:34] till we got seven
[59:39] things and the seventh
[59:41] one was
[59:44] love which is
[59:49] God all right this may not mean a thing
[59:53] in the world to you
[59:56] and the way some of your faces look it
[59:57] probably don't you wonder what in the
[59:59] world of man talking about talking about
[1:00:01] the Simple Plan of
[1:00:06] Redemption why would your Prophet say
[1:00:08] certain
[1:00:13] things if you have the revelation of
[1:00:16] what he said is there any problem with
[1:00:18] you saying
[1:00:23] it draw back to the pyramid
[1:00:28] now and you look at it and you see
[1:00:31] it love being the
[1:00:34] seventh the Bible
[1:00:37] says
[1:00:40] faith now you count them as we go
[1:00:43] up virtue knowledge temper godl you know
[1:00:48] patience God in his brotherly kindness
[1:00:50] and love that's seven things
[1:00:59] when I remember the story we
[1:01:02] started if all you can
[1:01:05] take is a number
[1:01:12] seven you've got your rest you got all
[1:01:14] your types your shadows enti our Bible
[1:01:17] is tied to a number seven which is
[1:01:20] completion now most of you that are read
[1:01:24] enough you remember on a little message
[1:01:26] called future
[1:01:30] home brother Brandon was tapping it as
[1:01:33] he was bringing it
[1:01:35] down tapping and coming
[1:01:39] down and he knew what they were thinking
[1:01:43] he said now you
[1:01:45] say right said what are you going to do
[1:01:48] now brother brandom because you run out
[1:01:51] of
[1:01:53] numbers
[1:01:55] you know why they were saying that
[1:01:57] because that's all the numbers mankind
[1:02:00] knew
[1:02:04] right that's all mankind could teach
[1:02:07] on a
[1:02:12] seven
[1:02:14] right he said no he said I hav't run out
[1:02:19] of numbers said I've got one
[1:02:22] more anyway to the number
[1:02:28] eight and he declared the number eight
[1:02:31] to represent
[1:02:34] eternity now we don't get this to be a
[1:02:38] number
[1:02:45] eight we're cutting ourselves short
[1:02:48] am CU if you're looking at the pyramid
[1:02:51] and now if you'll think
[1:02:53] sensible
[1:02:58] there's eight
[1:03:03] things but there's only seven
[1:03:11] ads
[1:03:13] right Peter's got eight
[1:03:19] things but he's only got seven
[1:03:23] ads
[1:03:24] because faith is not an
[1:03:26] ad it's not a
[1:03:30] virtue it's a
[1:03:32] birth you got to have the ver the birth
[1:03:35] before you can start
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:40] okay but there's eight things
[1:03:44] listed Seven is a number of
[1:03:48] completion as I said until brother
[1:03:50] brandham came mankind spoke of the
[1:03:53] number seven
[1:03:54] and that was the height of their
[1:03:58] understanding over in the Book of
[1:04:00] Revelations it mentions it three
[1:04:04] times it tells you in the Book of
[1:04:06] Revelations three
[1:04:08] times it talks about the seven spirits
[1:04:11] of
[1:04:16] God there's not seven spirits of God are
[1:04:19] they your Prophet said no he said it's
[1:04:23] the one Holy
[1:04:26] Spirit manifesting itself through seven
[1:04:29] Church a
[1:04:35] Messengers
[1:04:38] right he said
[1:04:40] this not
[1:04:42] seven
[1:04:44] spirits he said there's one Holy
[1:04:47] Spirit I've got these here if you need
[1:04:50] them it's off the message called a
[1:04:51] sardian church age yes the spirit is not
[1:04:54] not seven spirits but one it goes down
[1:04:57] to sardian church
[1:04:59] age that was uh 250
[1:05:03] 251 he covers it so we see that the
[1:05:06] seven spirits actually refer to the one
[1:05:08] spirit of God working out the will and
[1:05:11] word word of God in different
[1:05:15] Generations
[1:05:18] okay seven different times off the
[1:05:21] sardian church AG's message paragraphs
[1:05:24] 73 seven different times the Holy Spirit
[1:05:28] would anoint a
[1:05:32] messenger
[1:05:37] okay what about
[1:05:41] it so do you see what I'm trying to get
[1:05:43] you to look
[1:05:45] at
[1:05:47] ads R Run's right they seven
[1:05:52] ads Peter's is right and brother Brand's
[1:05:55] right there's eight
[1:06:00] manifestations then he said he brings a
[1:06:03] in the individual this is off the statue
[1:06:06] of perfect man right
[1:06:07] there he said he brings the individual
[1:06:10] and said the same way he brings the
[1:06:12] church that's right through seven Church
[1:06:16] ages now I said we're going to go so far
[1:06:19] I'm going to cut this deliberately and
[1:06:21] leave
[1:06:23] it
[1:06:24] because I cannot finish the
[1:06:27] message because it'll take too long if
[1:06:29] y'all want to stay till
[1:06:31] 5:00 we'll go
[1:06:34] ahead but now here's an
[1:06:42] individual that there's seven
[1:06:45] ads to that
[1:06:48] individual the Bible said I didn't add
[1:06:51] to your faith virtue knowledge temper
[1:06:54] those are virtues
[1:06:56] right the last one to be added is The
[1:07:00] Headstone right remember your disciples
[1:07:04] only got right
[1:07:05] here with the greatest they had of Paul
[1:07:08] and Peter and them cuz the headstone was
[1:07:11] rejected now may I quote brother brandom
[1:07:13] again he
[1:07:15] said it will come back in the end
[1:07:21] time it was rejected by there I've had
[1:07:25] arguments with people over this I these
[1:07:27] ain't no these saying arguments cuz
[1:07:29] there ain't no argument to it and I've
[1:07:32] had a lot of say you mean to Paul Paul
[1:07:34] didn't have the headstone I didn't say
[1:07:36] it brother random
[1:07:39] did right well I ain't found a quote no
[1:07:42] there's no quote that says Paul Never
[1:07:45] Had The Headstone
[1:07:49] y but you show me one where he did have
[1:07:52] it
[1:07:57] remember he got to right
[1:08:01] here that headstone was rejected back
[1:08:03] there you remember what I was saying
[1:08:05] this morning was you listening
[1:08:10] yes what is the headstone to the church
[1:08:13] the revealed word of God right whatever
[1:08:16] you want to call anything else it's a
[1:08:18] reveal word of
[1:08:20] God remember Jesus preached six
[1:08:24] in Matthew 24 and not one disciple
[1:08:28] understood what he was talking about
[1:08:33] amen not one disciple understood those
[1:08:37] were the seals of Matthew 24 to put in
[1:08:41] Revelation
[1:08:45] 6 not one disciple ever spoke of the son
[1:08:50] of
[1:08:51] man but the first thing brother brownon
[1:08:54] spoke when he started yeah that's right
[1:08:58] I've checked it out I haven't found it
[1:09:00] in 47 you got the computers you can run
[1:09:02] it and see when he first started but you
[1:09:05] know yourself that immediately in his
[1:09:08] ministry he started talking about the
[1:09:10] son of man
[1:09:14] right remember he had the sign of the
[1:09:17] son of man yep which was the sign of the
[1:09:20] Resurrection amen physically and
[1:09:23] spiritually
[1:09:26] brother R's the one that said The
[1:09:28] Headstone was rejected what was The
[1:09:31] Headstone what if those
[1:09:34] disciples we know it was the story it
[1:09:36] was meant to be but what if those
[1:09:39] disciples had have accepted all that
[1:09:42] Jesus
[1:09:42] said you and I wouldn't be here plain
[1:09:47] language amen he was d
[1:09:51] right we thank the word world is what
[1:09:54] turned him down them disciples never
[1:09:57] knew what he was talking about why
[1:10:00] because they did not have the Holy
[1:10:04] Spirit as a New
[1:10:07] Birth by not having it as a new birth
[1:10:10] they had no inside
[1:10:12] teacher that's right that's right there
[1:10:16] stood The Headstone you got to admit
[1:10:18] Christ is The Headstone you got to admit
[1:10:20] the Bible the stone that was rejected
[1:10:22] becomes the head of the
[1:10:25] corner that's right uh did it remind me
[1:10:28] that what it
[1:10:29] go brother dick used to talk about this
[1:10:31] long time
[1:10:32] ago
[1:10:34] headstone Cornerstone
[1:10:37] Sunstone it's just according to what
[1:10:39] you're using that's
[1:10:42] right this could not be put into the
[1:10:45] disciples why because it was
[1:10:47] rejected what was it put in the
[1:10:49] disciples the full understanding of the
[1:10:52] word of God
[1:10:54] amen if it had it been you wouldn't
[1:10:56] needed a prophit in the last days that's
[1:11:00] right I told you it'll be Wednesday I
[1:11:02] got to finish on you know brother
[1:11:04] Brown's message didn't
[1:11:06] begin y when he first started that's
[1:11:09] right
[1:11:12] man come on it's in the future I mean
[1:11:15] it's in the Rapture message I got the
[1:11:17] others laying on the desk okay I didn't
[1:11:20] bring them cuz I afraid I get started on
[1:11:21] it brother brother said not in years of
[1:11:24] preparation not in years when he began
[1:11:26] to S but said he went declared his
[1:11:30] message until
[1:11:32] 1963 brother random was doing a work of
[1:11:35] restoration that's
[1:11:37] right restoring back to the faith of the
[1:11:40] fathers 63 the sealed open his message
[1:11:44] went end eternal life we'll get to that
[1:11:48] Wednesday but I want you to
[1:11:52] think
[1:11:55] as the individual comes up so does the
[1:11:56] church come up
[1:12:00] right now we've declared the
[1:12:03] reason that the prophet would write Holy
[1:12:05] Spirit I forget I got it over here
[1:12:08] forget the reason that he would write
[1:12:10] this in would be to show us this Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit would seal all of this in this is
[1:12:16] the holy spirit this as well all of that
[1:12:19] would be the holy spirit it's his faith
[1:12:23] his is not given to you am okay
[1:12:26] everybody understand
[1:12:28] that so then when you take that Holy
[1:12:32] Spirit make it all you don't count
[1:12:35] it but you got seven
[1:12:38] ads and you got eight
[1:12:41] things to be dealt with right I didn't
[1:12:44] say eight virtues you only have seven
[1:12:46] virtues that's right that's the key to
[1:12:48] the whole thing you only have seven
[1:12:51] Church ages right you don't have eight
[1:12:54] Church ages there's no such thing as an
[1:12:57] eth Church
[1:13:00] age but some of you older ones
[1:13:04] remember there was a Doctrine back there
[1:13:06] called The Eighth Day that we're already
[1:13:09] living in the Eighth
[1:13:11] Day we're already in
[1:13:14] eternity no you're still under a
[1:13:18] seven physically we're under a
[1:13:22] seven
[1:13:24] physically people will be in the
[1:13:26] Millennium under a
[1:13:28] seven but the bride will be there Body
[1:13:31] Spirit and soul with eternal life
[1:13:33] already into the eth The Eighth Day
[1:13:36] don't come until the future home
[1:13:39] amen there a lot to be
[1:13:41] preached you think sometimes that I drag
[1:13:44] out I wish you'd see me like this
[1:13:46] morning I said No Need No need no need I
[1:13:50] can't bring that I feel the trash can up
[1:13:56] with quotes from R brandom because I'd
[1:13:58] never be able to bring
[1:14:01] it you think I'm slow
[1:14:05] now I'm just trying to get you to see
[1:14:10] something well I don't understand he got
[1:14:12] a 70 got an 80 got then you don't
[1:14:14] understand eternal life amen that's
[1:14:17] right when that Holy Ghost came into
[1:14:20] your soul it didn't put it in a seven
[1:14:22] that was only the types of the Old
[1:14:24] Testament of the
[1:14:26] rest not only spoke of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:29] the rest Jesus said come unto me all you
[1:14:32] ever heav L I'll give you a number eight
[1:14:35] into your
[1:14:36] soul
[1:14:38] that's see they thought seven seven
[1:14:41] seven
[1:14:44] seven it's all right
[1:14:48] then if faith is not an ad then you got
[1:14:52] seven ads
[1:14:54] that will bring the headstone to the
[1:14:58] church well brother Dale now you're
[1:15:00] facing something cuz you're facing a
[1:15:03] situation that you just
[1:15:05] said the prophet said as the individual
[1:15:09] is built
[1:15:12] so is the ages
[1:15:17] built so we
[1:15:19] got by virtue of being a part of God
[1:15:23] starting from we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[1:15:31] 8 we got it past
[1:15:38] completion Church
[1:15:43] ages now how are you going to bring that
[1:15:45] in the church
[1:15:51] ages I won't try
[1:15:56] to we'll just let brother brandham do
[1:16:00] it
[1:16:02] okay cuz they ain't got no sense
[1:16:07] to sense didn't figure it out
[1:16:11] either
[1:16:13] okay let's go to number 16 you'll see we
[1:16:17] jumped a long
[1:16:19] ways back before then to make sure you
[1:16:22] don't get lost on what I'm talking
[1:16:25] about he says the last quote we gave you
[1:16:28] from the sardian church age 1960
[1:16:32] 1209 that there's seven different times
[1:16:35] the Holy Spirit would anoint a messenger
[1:16:39] yep right now how many Messengers are
[1:16:45] they how many Church age angels does it
[1:16:49] list
[1:16:51] seven right
[1:16:55] right all right now we got to have seven
[1:16:59] Messengers that'll fit identically with
[1:17:02] the seven ads
[1:17:04] amen but we got to have eight
[1:17:11] manifestations or else I'm
[1:17:16] wrong so let's let brother brandom say
[1:17:20] it go to number 16 all we on it start
[1:17:24] off at
[1:17:25] 50 he talks about the martyrdoms and how
[1:17:28] they're waiting then in the next Age
[1:17:31] come the Lutheran the reformer age they
[1:17:34] went to wise with the cunningness and
[1:17:35] coming down they married and come on
[1:17:37] down after the death of Wesley they had
[1:17:40] a Methodist organization there you keep
[1:17:43] going that way it's just it does
[1:17:46] that and I want you to notice see that
[1:17:50] someone might ask
[1:17:53] about this
[1:17:55] Pentecostal which was the third age now
[1:17:57] you know what he's talking about
[1:17:58] Pentecostal is not the third age
[1:18:00] Pentecost to the seventh age right so
[1:18:02] now you know what he's talking about
[1:18:03] he's talking about the third age coming
[1:18:06] forth from the three of justification
[1:18:09] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:11] Ghost everybody with me amen we got
[1:18:13] enough sense to know that he ain't
[1:18:16] messed
[1:18:17] up so justification sanctification
[1:18:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost I give you
[1:18:22] another quote want it you can find it
[1:18:24] brother R said the last three messages
[1:18:26] of the last three ages completed the
[1:18:32] birth so now he's talking about the
[1:18:36] Pentecostals
[1:18:37] look you see each one of those ages only
[1:18:40] taking a dip into the Holy Spirit
[1:18:42] justification is the work of the Holy
[1:18:44] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[1:18:46] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:18:49] spirit watch
[1:18:51] him
[1:18:56] now I didn't write the
[1:18:58] book you want to quit
[1:19:01] reading come
[1:19:03] on that's the reason it took a prophetic
[1:19:06] Prophet to come
[1:19:08] down oh that's brother
[1:19:10] brandom finish
[1:19:16] reading right finish
[1:19:19] reading that ain't brother brandom
[1:19:22] that's right he says it I didn't that's
[1:19:27] right that's the reason it took a
[1:19:29] prophetic he's talking about ausa street
[1:19:31] right that's right Pentecostal ausa
[1:19:34] Street that's right 1906 right
[1:19:37] amen that's the reason it took a
[1:19:39] prophetic Prophet to come down no
[1:19:41] Messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:19:44] Ghost came
[1:19:45] himself in his fullness of the

[1:21:27] don't care I don't care if he's the son

[1:22:41] faith of the fathers

[1:22:47] Revelation contain in the Seven Seals

[1:23:11] I'll tell you where it's at but why
[1:23:13] don't you save yourself a time and look
[1:23:15] it up why hadn't you read
[1:23:21] it oh but we're in the
[1:23:24] message what
[1:23:28] message see brother brandham come at the
[1:23:30] End of the
[1:23:34] Age Now what age did he come at the end
[1:23:46] of okay remember that's questions and
[1:23:51] answers only the
[1:23:55] seals that I just read
[1:23:59] from preached in
[1:24:03] 1963 324 what it is the morning service
[1:24:08] questions and
[1:24:09] answers he just said
[1:24:12] that but I just can't see how zeusa
[1:24:14] Street was
[1:24:15] anything brother brandom said it was the
[1:24:19] restoration of the gifts and that's all
[1:24:22] people wants to take
[1:24:25] gifts he just called it the person of
[1:24:28] the Holy Ghost in the fullness of his
[1:24:39] baptism a prophetic
[1:24:45] Prophet you me zeusa street was a
[1:24:48] prophetic
[1:24:50] Prophet yes sir because it was the
[1:24:53] person of Jesus
[1:24:56] Christ no messenger now you're going to
[1:24:59] have to listen no Messenger to isusa
[1:25:04] Street you can't make it come out right
[1:25:07] you take the oneeyed black man and make
[1:25:09] him a messenger brother brandham says he
[1:25:12] was the messenger of isusa
[1:25:15] street now you got
[1:25:19] eight
[1:25:21] angels
[1:25:26] if you make the oneeyed man on the zeusa
[1:25:30] street that form of a
[1:25:34] messenger it was the Holy Ghost on ausa
[1:25:39] street I just read it that's the reason
[1:25:41] it took a prophetic
[1:25:45] Prophet see but the baptism is the holy
[1:25:49] spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:25:50] prophetic Prophet to come down
[1:25:56] you realize the Holy Ghost is the
[1:25:59] prophet do I need those quotes for
[1:26:07] you I remember the first time we were
[1:26:09] sitting in Jeffersonville Indiana it had
[1:26:11] to be
[1:26:13] 1968 there was an argument back then
[1:26:15] over who was going to take over who is
[1:26:17] going to be the leader who is going to
[1:26:18] be the Holy Ghost to lead us
[1:26:21] through Billy Paul got up and read a
[1:26:23] quote from Brother brandom Where the
[1:26:26] Holy Ghost is the messenger of this
[1:26:37] age if you think I'm doing the way with
[1:26:39] brother brandham you tell me I'm reading
[1:26:42] exactly what he says he's the one that's
[1:26:45] putting it in
[1:26:46] charge right putting it in its
[1:26:51] place
[1:27:04] watching just in case you keep on and
[1:27:07] want to run off with it brother brand on
[1:27:09] the questions and answers in
[1:27:10] 1963 324 pull number 18 up we're going
[1:27:14] to jump 17 and go to
[1:27:19] 18 and the man of the seventh angel
[1:27:23] messenger where's he going to come at
[1:27:26] the end of the lady oan
[1:27:36] age Elijah of Malachi 4 was to come at
[1:27:40] the end of the seventh Church
[1:27:48] age
[1:27:51] okay
[1:27:54] now before I get to it Wednesday night
[1:27:55] just remember all the messengers comes
[1:27:58] the end of the age that's
[1:28:02] right there's only seven
[1:28:05] angels but there's eight manifestations
[1:28:08] of God in those seven Church ages that's
[1:28:10] what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:28:12] there's only seven virtues to add the
[1:28:15] virtues but there eight manifestations
[1:28:17] in the person from Faith virtue
[1:28:20] knowledge temper patience godliness
[1:28:21] brother kindness and love turned out to
[1:28:24] be eight
[1:28:25] manifestations in your
[1:28:28] life the church ages is
[1:28:31] identical you have eight manifestations
[1:28:34] of God but only seven
[1:28:41] angels can you remember the quote we
[1:28:44] wrote up there can you remember
[1:28:47] that the Pentecostal isusa
[1:28:51] Street
[1:28:53] that it would be a prophetic Prophet
[1:28:55] would come down no Messenger to the age
[1:28:57] they wouldn't no Messenger to the zeusa
[1:28:59] street to name it as a messenger brother
[1:29:01] brandham gives credit to the oneeyed
[1:29:03] black man he said it like this one day
[1:29:05] he said a oneeyed m black man and a
[1:29:07] couple of bums you ever heard that
[1:29:10] one he said in a couple of bums started
[1:29:15] the work of missionary
[1:29:19] there if you remember the they were
[1:29:25] trinitarians that's right but that don't
[1:29:27] have anything to do with the West doctor
[1:29:31] never come to about 1912 folks so don't
[1:29:33] don't try to run me and say you're wrong
[1:29:36] oh they were a zeusa street with
[1:29:38] trinitarians right but that don't make
[1:29:41] no difference the Holy Ghost
[1:29:44] fell on the zeusa
[1:29:49] street remember that one I'll read this
[1:29:52] one and I'm quitting all right go back

[1:37:26] eight
[1:37:27] manifestations of almighty God that's
[1:37:31] right just as in the pyramid you got
[1:37:34] seven
[1:37:35] ads with the Seven Virtues but eight
[1:37:39] manifestations because he puts it to you
[1:37:42] at
[1:37:44] Faith and he turned out to be the eighth
[1:37:47] which is love which is eternal life amen
[1:37:55] Zeus's Street no Messenger to the
[1:37:59] age the Holy Ghost came himself and he
[1:38:02] says another great
[1:38:09] prophet but R had no trouble calling the
[1:38:11] Holy Ghost a prophet because the Holy
[1:38:14] Ghost is the
[1:38:16] prophet remember brother randam said
[1:38:20] what
[1:38:23] I am not the son of
[1:38:27] man I only come to introduce the son of
[1:38:32] man brother brandham was what what did
[1:38:36] he say he was he said I'm a
[1:38:40] prophet said he is the
[1:38:44] prophet now we got it right it just took
[1:38:48] a little time to express
[1:38:54] that there's eight manifestations of God
[1:38:57] throughout seven Church ages and we wind
[1:39:00] up at the last just right there under
[1:39:04] the head the
[1:39:06] love and a prophet to bring a
[1:39:11] message you realize now that we're just
[1:39:14] now stepping back into the Bible that's
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:21] I didn't make the statement brother
[1:39:23] random
[1:39:24] did 1977 be the 70th Jubilee since the
[1:39:27] beginning of jubilees from According to
[1:39:30] Leviticus
[1:39:33] 258 258 deals with the 77s of 49 which
[1:39:38] is the seven Church
[1:39:43] ages you realize brother brandham came
[1:39:45] in the seventh age ending it up but his
[1:39:49] message spoke of eternal life
[1:39:52] I ask you
[1:39:54] church this one thing go home and do it
[1:39:57] I know you ain't done it I've asked you
[1:39:58] over and over to do it and it would give
[1:40:01] you a
[1:40:02] shock to go home and get the little book
[1:40:06] that list the
[1:40:08] tapes the messages of brother brandom
[1:40:10] right cuz probably a lot of them don't
[1:40:12] even have it cuz you ain't concerned
[1:40:14] with
[1:40:16] it I would like for you to read the
[1:40:19] titles of the sermons after the
[1:40:24] seals just read the
[1:40:27] title of the sermons after the
[1:40:32] seals and every one of them deals with
[1:40:35] eternal
[1:40:38] life things that ought to be who is this
[1:40:42] mesic marriage and divorce invisible
[1:40:46] Union the future
[1:40:49] home ever met
[1:40:52] message even the titles of the
[1:40:55] sermons after the seals
[1:40:58] broke shows you the prophet's
[1:41:03] message that's
[1:41:06] right not in years he said a preparation
[1:41:09] we'll get to this Wednesday we said when
[1:41:11] he begins to
[1:41:12] sound see he spent 30 something years
[1:41:15] coming up to the fact of trying to
[1:41:17] preach the statue of a perfect man
[1:41:20] Return of the faith of the fathers back
[1:41:21] to the
[1:41:24] church then the seals
[1:41:29] broke then everybody in the message was
[1:41:34] what you want to turn on the computer
[1:41:36] and let you read some of the doctrines
[1:41:39] they
[1:41:41] have that in
[1:41:43] 1963 the Lord Jesus came to Earth in the
[1:41:47] form of William
[1:41:49] brandham
[1:41:57] where are
[1:41:59] we that's right but I've concluded that
[1:42:02] part if you can't understand it I'm
[1:42:04] sorry pray about
[1:42:07] it there's seven ads to the pyramid but
[1:42:10] there's eight manifestations of God
[1:42:13] because it starts at Faith and goes to
[1:42:15] love there's seven Church
[1:42:19] ages but there's no Messenger to isusa
[1:42:22] Street the Holy Ghost came himself so
[1:42:25] he's not counted a
[1:42:29] prophet he is the messenger of each
[1:42:32] age he come to make way for brother
[1:42:35] randam to step on the
[1:42:38] scene the prophet made way for the
[1:42:42] prophet to bring his
[1:42:45] message what a wonderful
[1:42:49] thought
[1:42:52] to think about we're standing on the
[1:42:54] brims of
[1:42:59] Eternity on the edges of Eternity
[1:43:02] looking
[1:43:06] at eternal
[1:43:14] life you come to the Millennium see the
[1:43:17] Millennium is to the
[1:43:18] Jews it is still under the seven Church
[1:43:21] age goes all the way to to the uh if I'm
[1:43:24] quing it correctly the seven Church age
[1:43:26] goes into the
[1:43:29] uh White
[1:43:34] Throne Millennium is still under a seven
[1:43:38] amen but we're there with eternal life
[1:43:42] amen then a future home will come into
[1:43:48] being and I'll say this this one so you
[1:43:51] musicians get
[1:43:53] ready see then you say but it's 77s is
[1:43:59] 49 now what your point and you're
[1:44:03] right but you're not totally
[1:44:06] right 77s is 49 so you go 77s is 49 the
[1:44:11] first year of the next
[1:44:14] 49 you're counting that to
[1:44:19] 50
[1:44:21] but it's
[1:44:22] not they never reached a
[1:44:25] 50 they never celebrated a
[1:44:32] 50 come on that's what you think I know
[1:44:34] it I've talked with some of you 77 is 49
[1:44:37] the first year of the next is a 50 no
[1:44:40] it's not it's just starting back over
[1:44:42] it's a one you say that represents
[1:44:44] eternal life it represents eternal life
[1:44:46] but it is not eternal life the future
[1:44:49] home is a 50
[1:44:54] the Millennium is still a seven 7 sevens
[1:44:57] is
[1:44:58] 49 the future home will be the

[1:45:19] than that you're not going to a 50
[1:45:21] you're going back to a one comes back
[1:45:23] over again we're not supposed to go to a
[1:45:25] one and come back over and I said you're

[1:45:31] it will be
[1:45:33] 7749 and the first year of the next will
[1:45:36] start the next
[1:45:37] 49 that's right

[1:45:44] to be a
[1:45:46] 50 you said there ain't no 50 yes

[1:46:06] eight matches exactly this messenger was
[1:46:10] to bring us a message of eternal
[1:46:12] life he is to stand between us and
[1:46:17] Eternity and declare it amen
[1:46:22] Leviticus 258 77 is 49 but Leviticus
[1:46:27] 2510 is a
[1:46:31] 50 read your
[1:46:34] Bible under the
[1:46:37] 49 under the
[1:46:39] sevens there is no
[1:46:42] Rapture no type of a
[1:46:44] Rapture because a person worked for
[1:46:46] seven years and he went for went free in
[1:46:49] the seventh year and that's the way the
[1:46:50] Bible said in the seventh year they go
[1:46:52] so really didn't work for six years so
[1:46:55] you go free in the
[1:46:57] seventh if you went into bondage with a
[1:46:59] wife read your Bible you'll come out of
[1:47:02] bondage with a wife but if your master
[1:47:05] gave you a wife she remains in bondage
[1:47:09] right if a master gives you children or
[1:47:11] a wife would she has children they
[1:47:13] remain in
[1:47:14] bondage but read Leviticus
[1:47:18] 2510 everything thing goes
