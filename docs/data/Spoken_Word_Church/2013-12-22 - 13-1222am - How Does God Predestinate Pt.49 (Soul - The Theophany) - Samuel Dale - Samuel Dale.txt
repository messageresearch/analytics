Corinthians chapter 6. there are any of you having a matter against another to go to the law before the unjust did not before the Saints know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life yeah yeah I speak to your shame it is so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to the law with one another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourself to be defrauded thank you know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters or not adultery not feminists not abuses of themselves with mankind and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God meets father belly and the belly for me but God shall destroy them and God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication not for but for the Lord and the Lord for the body they don't have no ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot God forbid but he that is drawing unto the Lord is one spirit what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for a year about with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which ye are Gods amen God bless you be seated Lord when the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart openly Eyes of My Heart to see you I am lifted him shining in the light of your glory amen of as we say shining in the light of your glory pour out to power and lovely holy amen holy holy holy way right You Are Holy Holy Holy yes your holy holy holy I want to see amen and amen and amen so just turn around and look at each other and you'll find God good to see everybody in the house of the Lord that was saying we had a visitor but our brother was with us Wednesday so he doesn't get another welcome when you come one time you get a welcome you come two times you're just part of us but good to have everybody in the house of the Lord remember especially this morning to pray for Anna she called you know she's been having troubles with uh female Provost okay with a lot of bleeding and uh that way she said she started bleeding after they got up in Tennessee so it can be a problem you know a lot of doing so let's just pray that everything will be all right and all like that I believe it will and all because she has an appointment uh later on when she gets back to try to get everything corrected but as of right now it's still a problem so you sisters just remember her especially on that all right now remember they will not be a service this coming Wednesday it will be Christmas so we say to all of you Merry Christmas have a good time and just remember that we love the Lord we don't have to worry about putting Christ back into Christmas because we never did take him out of anything in Christmas Christmas to me is is 365 and a four days a year you know that's that's just me I'm a little childish I I like Christmas you know you say well I don't like it it's too heater and it's well everything you got is here so what about it you know just be a good old heathena and then forgive it we don't put no Santa Claus in the church we don't put no wreaths on the doors here at the church or anything like that but we just try to be a Christian and be what we can be all right remember that number watch not service December the 31st on Tuesday brother Timothy Burdette will be preaching for US service starting at eight o'clock and I remember and you come and bring your testimonies or you know whatever you've got make your plans to where that if we have time we will have a testimonial service and things before midnight and all like that so just remember that all right then remember there will be no service on January the first because that is a Wednesday so remember that and just pray that the Lord would bless and in the Bible study will be I went back to fifth it was the fourth of January and uh so remember that and it's back to what normal questions and answers so we've been having a pretty good time really enjoyed the last one and all and if you don't want a copy of it you're welcome to it so just remember that any more announcements remember the finger food sisters you know Brothers whatever a few Brothers want to fix up something we'll eat it too because we we have a good time and that way we don't have to go out after the service on you know what's not service we don't have to go out to the world and the things we can sit down and eat together a little bit but if you want to come on about six or seven o'clock we'll probably have a little bit to eat for then so just just remember and pray one for another all right any other announcements anybody wants to stay over you need to have them where they put it down right if anybody wants to stay over on the what's not service night all right you know after it put it down downstairs and we will make arrangements would somebody for you to be able to stay with them that you don't have to go home you know right after midnight in a different thing okay anything else okay let's just pray father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for all things and we just ask you to help us and guide us this day as we try to talk about you Lord and speak about the things that you've laid upon our heart to cover and in doing it may you come and Quicken that word unto us that we may become the word the prophet said we become the word as we receive it so then we appreciate that we ask you to have your way remember to stick Among Us just touch each one we know that there is many different sicknesses and things among us now that are doing and we know and use promised it in your word you said you sent your word and healed us well we're doing our best Lord to try to bring the word so then we believe that you will come Among Us and heal the sick deliver each one remember especially Anna there with that bleeding and we pray that it was with the the time there in the Bible when a lady had been to many doctors and done everything she could do and all but yet once into your presence then the blood issue stopped so we condemned that issue that's causing the problems now in the name of Jesus Christ we love you and we thank you just have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Romans 8 in Ephesians 1. Romans 8 in Ephesians 1. Lord willing maybe this afternoon we'll try to get a little more back on to our predestination all right I've I've not tried to get away from it I believe that this is what we needed to understand you know and trying to get a foundation to make sure we do understand what the Lord is wanting in this day okay Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called let me also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us okay let's go over to Ephesians in try to read a couple of scriptures Ephesians 1 in beginning with verse 3. that should be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings were in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we covered this past Wednesday of talking about what is a soul so I was asked back under to speak on this so it came out to be a good time okay the announcements these things are up here on the platform um this if I knew how to run this thing I'd buy a whole lot of them but uh maybe one of these days y'all are getting me up on a yeah I get a good I call them iPod iPod and then all kind of farts and parts and pads and and they get me fixed up you know but there is a good one and it's only like 20 29 that you can put the whole message into your phone and that would be good you know take it with you you can have the whole message and they'll order it they'll send it to you spoken word and you can put it into your phone you got it right there will you I might get encouraged to get one I'm still having troubles with the the regular phone so we don't worry about it all right but now as I saying we were talking about this past Wednesday especially of what is a soul you know I don't think we understand you know what we're really dealing with in in the point of trying to talk about these things and uh you know there's been so much talk contrary to the truth until you know it's hard to try to get people to listen to the word uh you know I I was listening we was to or maybe that I don't want to deer stand the other day one listening to brother Branham because that's what I do I just sit there and run through and like last night I think we listened to three two or three tapes we do that a lot we just sat there and listen and you know go right through but Rhoda Branham was talking about if we don't believe all of the truth no you know what he said he said you've got the wrong interpreter I mean that's as blunt as can be he said if we don't believe all the truth and we take away a little bit or whatever you know when we divide he said we don't have the correct interpreter because that's the holy spirit's supposed to be the only interpreter of the word right all right but see this has been argued with of mankind about to religious Realms going down through organizations and things and you know of what is really the soul of man and that's what I tried my best to express what I could I have for 40 something years here to preach to you and uh to try to get you to see I believe the soul is the real you all right and see we we want to just make it something that's just not uh real and then we want to go with the soul is just the nature of the spirit well that's not a quote and challenge you to find it for me the prophet says the soul is the nature of the spirit when the people put that just the nature of the spirit it was just putting it in a realm of floating Spirits or this kind of spirits or nothing real it's just the nature of something so you got a dog it's the nature of a dog you've got a cat it's the nature of a cat you got a human that's a nature of Mom and Daddy it don't have to be right it don't have to be then that's where the people get it in there you know they'll just say well brother Dale the the prophet said the soul is the nature of the spirit well okay but is that just tacking something onto something you know a nature or something is what you inherit right right a dog a bird dog through its natural inheritance through its parents it comes out to be a bird dog and it will point you don't have to be trying to point it will automatically point because that's this nature of its doing you know and things well then if that be true of just an animal that has no soul what about a human being but that's what I was trying to get across to us about the soul and bringing the scriptures and involving all of it that it says the soul that sent us shall die doesn't say the spirit that's right it doesn't say the body I want scripture for it yeah but I believe so and so I don't care what you believe I'm sorry that's just past that you know I think what we need to do here is pass out some sugar tits around in this place because we've had more hurt feelings around here in the past three or four months than we've ever had as long as I've been pastor and I thank all this going backside and get a I'll get some pacifiers and just give everybody one and you know you can get over your hurt feelings and if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry but check it out see where the truth or not you hurt my feelings I always try to check it to see whether it's right or not see then that way we just put our feelings where supposed to be sitting on them okay you remember now we we're getting in a day where it's getting pretty bad when they when I can jump on to a Duck Dynasty guys bro what are they saying who do you think they're going to get after next you know and do all of that but you know so right now the world's divided over whether or not he would have said that or understood it but that's all right that's none of my business I don't I didn't know that until the other day we had I was wondering what are they doing you know because I don't have a TV and no food with it but now listen if the soul is the thing that senteth or the part or whatever we are then it would have to be more real than the body and it would have to be more real than the spirit realm of mankind because animals have a spirit Realm of their being you know but they don't have a soul all right now then in seeing it then we ought to realize the reality of the soul that it was no way the Old Testament people could have the soul of God to come to them because there was no way made for it to come so it would be an anointing from the spirit to come and it could be on Balaam it could be on Moses and be the same anointing and come over in the New Testament and you can still have the anointed ones right that we talk about that it's a genuine Holy Spirit anointing people's spirit for them to do the things they're doing you know and be who they are but still down inside of there is the real you I've tried my best to get people to see that since the two Soul doctrines started back in the probably in the 60s and in the part of my Ministry that I've tried to have I've tried my best to not attack people but yet to try to explain the truth because see it must need to be heresies among you why because it'll make you dig and it'll prove who's who that's right by the heresies that are among you so then they there had to be heresies the brains make us think about amen you know people wouldn't thinking about the soul we're in any organization denominationalisms Etc was anybody talking about the soul of man as I told you they even had people back there that I ran into that said you didn't even have a soul until the law came into being well there's a lot of things that people believe about this that or the other but what does that matter in in the whole realm it's you and I mean and it's like I'm saying you your your new birth's not in your body your new birth's not in your spirit because the Bible says that and I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit but the prophet of God said that's not the Holy Spirit he said then I put my spirit in you didn't say I'll give you another new spirit he said I put my spirit in you my being my part that I am to be dwelling in you anointed ones that's not in you right right come on Lord I know the difference anointed ones and true genuine because anointing ones that's not in you it's on you what let's see then we just say well so overnights are so business would you see and you're taking the old the the older years of the prophet's message and try to make doctrines out of it when I've tried my best to show you for 40-something years that that Prophet didn't have to change what he taught because he always taught five senses for the body see taste feel smelled here he always taught five senses for the second realm which was reason memory conscious affections love Etc whatever imaginations he always taught one sense for the soul either Faith or doubt all right it's not both of them faith and doubt you know now we're going to get to it when we get down maybe this afternoon God won't dwell in an unclean vessel dude don't you put no soul of God in you and the soul of the devil now you're getting into a garbage can all right I'm sorry but I think it's time to be blunt I have been for 40 something years if you've listened to me so there's no need of changing now you know and try to Sweet soft the thing you know and uh soap it there what you call that word but now listen see then the Soul is the nature of the spirit one because that Spirit displays what your soul is right the nature of my actions in my body the actions by my spirit realm displaced what's inside of me right I mean if like the prophet said if I was John Dillinger you would expect me to carry a couple of pistols this morning you know because that would be what would be inside of me all right but that's not what's in there see then the born-again Christian is not born again in body you're not born again in your spirit amen you're born again in the center realm the soul but brother Dale I got worse come on read to quit read what's what Rim he's talking about draw you three circles and then stay with what he's talking about each circle and what the being of it is but see that ain't going to change nobody unless somebody's searching for truth you wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been somebody trying to search for truth right that's right amen because that way we're searching all right we don't claim to have all the truth but we claim to believe what we believe all right now then the rest of it will take care of itself as we go along but see the soul is the real you it's truly what you are it will live on after death amen the body doesn't live on the spirit doesn't live on it's the soul the real you that's what you are you are a soul a being Joel means person being whatever all right and I'll get back to this in a while see then if we can believe that Jesus's soul you know went to hell that it was his Spirit his soul his person of his being his theophany then why can't we believe what we are mainly because you ain't never heard it that's the reason people don't believe it they've got their preconceived ideas and thoughts and they're not going to change it I don't expect people to change their thoughts I don't expect you to accept what I say I expect you to go look up what I say that's why I read what the prophet said I don't even just give you well quote Prophet said so and so well you don't know whether that's right or not unless you write it down real quick but see I just put it up here and let you read it at least you can't argue with that point all right but listen the soul the prophet said it's what you are amen it's more real than this come on it was before this you remember Ezekiel 18 4 All Souls are mine Satan can't give you a soul come on I don't blow all those doctrines out of the world but it won't Satan can't give you a soul and make him a creator All Souls God said her mind the soul of the Father the soul of the son he said All Souls are mine all right now then if we are that if we are a being a soul then we were created in the image of God I'll get to that later on in the message but I'm just laying down a few thoughts see the soul is what governs you right not your body right it's not your spirit that governs you now governs governs what does governance mean rules dominates right right so if I'm John Dillinger you'd expect me to be a crook but by saying I'm a Christian I'm not supposed to have that form of nature right see then if I'm lying cheating stealing running around with women commit adulter all kind of things and you know for certain there's something wrong on the Edward part of me brother Dale it's just my spirit I was just born this way that's what I told my brother said God made me this way and he can't judge me for being wrong I said he didn't make you wrong he made you right you went wrong with everybody he can judge you for being wrong he didn't make you go wrong we've been through that right you know when I say things people just go hey where I believe every soul was created perfect I did not say eternal the baby's born it's perfect I did not say eternal all right you show me where God can create anything imperfect can you show that to me I'll put a sign on my back and walk out of here right now and we'll just quit but you know you can't do it right see God doesn't create anything imperfect we perverted we deform it a tree bending over what something happened to cause a deformity all right when you and I are born as babies that's as perfect as you can be right right but by giving you a free morning agency a choice in us being born where we're at then you start out automatically being wrong because everything you hear to say the little baby is born in the hospital bed laying there you know and all the nurses and going around and said boy blankety blankety blankety blank look at this full moon all these babies blankety blank you know cussing like crazy he said well the baby can't hear have you ever asked a baby couldn't hear yeah whose authority are you going on right if you don't believe it can hear walk in a room and speak to it right it may not be able to roll around do very much but it's going to try its best turn the Way You Are right see that's what gets me is all these people telling their theologies you know well a baby can't do this the baby can't whoever asked the baby huh well we determine that because well you were the baby because the baby's got more sense than you have all right that's just plain but it's true but it's perfect not Eternal perfect he become a living soul God breathed into his nostrils he become a living soul all right then what is that what govern you is what you are you are what you are remember progress 66 or uncertain Sam I didn't put these up now these are quotes the soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul your soul is real it's not just a spirit part floating around it's more real than your body right it was in being before your body was dropped from Mama right right it's more real but see we want something tangible well brother Dale I just never have seen a soul you haven't you've never seen a soul how about waking up I know it's well on over and it'll probably be next week week after next and we're next year but Moses desired to see God right am I right he talked to him face to face he'd talk to him lip to ear he'd been in his presence he had seen all kinds of things but one day he desired to see God you know what God said let's go stand over on that Cliff to the Rock and I'll pass by and you can see my back part because you can't see my face right now and he saw the back part of a man amen amen but brother Dale you just you just make God a man well what are you going to make him yeah but but he's just a spirit you've been taught that all your life why don't you wake up read for yourself get your Baptist glasses Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal and Brandon Myers you know what I mean by that not brought around his message the idiots in this message the way they try to read to you what you get them glasses and then believe it right is God real amen amen well he's just a spirit yes and here it comes along like this in the message you want to sympathize right I'm telling some brothers one time years ago about it and they said well well brother so-and-so said God was just like a spirit just floating around I said brother random said he was not like a spirit he was not like the wind he was a being well that's his way of seeing it yeah I'll get what he sees I said another day I wish sometimes you could sit with me on a deer stand and listen to God my wife would talk about it the other day have you ever seen anybody that could talk like run around them I get so I mean I get so amazed at just listening to him talk a seventh grade education man and he's explaining Body Spirit and soul to the doctors and the doctor says man there's something crazy about you said you could dream a dream without going to sleep he said oh that's what you're talking about he said have you ever heard of visions said the prophets had visions do you realize that we I am anyway I'm gonna put it that way I'll get back up to myself and forget it I read the scripture sometimes and it doesn't sound right you don't ever do that you know it's not clear I don't understand it but then I click on the tape and the prophet's explaining that scripture and it makes it so simple there's no other way it could be said than that right you realize that the very words of the man now not every time he said the and and button this and that and the other you know according with human being but I've still got to listen to him as a human being right even if even if what he's got he ain't saying thus saith the Lord I still don't listen to him explain it man hadn't you well he ain't explained it my way oh that went wrong didn't it remember the word comes to the prophet it don't come to you except by way of the prophet we don't have a right to believe no we lost that right as Christians amen right right so the soul is what governs you it's what you are you are what you are by your soul you remember this one was on it you must be born again 61. what is a soul it's you you are a soul well it's the spirit that's floating around if you don't think there's more into you being real then uh you know if if you don't think there's something in you that's more real then what you are suppose I tap Michael on the head something's going to tell him to holler oh right so there's something in there that's more real than anything else but see that's what we don't think and we don't think God is real we think he's just some floating Spirit floating around it's been the hardest thing in my life to try to express what little sensible thing that I could see about how real God is he's got to be more real than all of this he created it yes but I just thought he was a spirit floating around this is fear he just comes down as a spirit and he does he's omniscient he's omnipresent he's all of those things but yet he's not real you see folks what we're doing is letting the devil interpret that's what we've done all of our lives we've let him interpret to us instead of taking what God Said but you see what they're doing today okay but listen when men fail what did the prophet explain like blasphemus I mean uh greatest battle ever fall he said that God chose the heart of man he said Satan chose his head right right now the head is the intelligence form of situation we think right but that's wrong because we don't think with our head right right oh that's just a bunch of massive bright I just a bunch of stuff to record that's a good tape recorder that's a good computer but you don't think with your head the Bible says as a man thank a word in his heart so is he heart of man is soul of man right not just spirit it's soul it's being is what you are so God chose the soul of man Satan chose the head now in the head is all the intelligence of the human being right but the soul is down inside of there not as just they're going to run around them explaining it and he said science says that the human heart has an inch square compartment no other animal has he said could it be the Bold of the Soul now ain't that something he's not explaining that the inch square compartment is where you're living at the real you right right he's telling you what science says that there is ability of human man to be something different than the animals your soul is you right right is what you are as I say in Wednesday night trying to explain it then see we say to our kids well we just let them grow up and be what they want to because that's the way they want to be let them be and we didn't do that with ours right right you can do what you want to with yours but we didn't do that with ours an old Papa you know old old grandpa go to your granddaddy little Abby was acting up one day and I told him I said you need to correct her and I said you need to get a little Hickory don't enter with your hand well they didn't go get the Hickory I got one outside and got one and I brought it in I said use that instead of your hand instead of hollering and screaming at them shaking them he never heard nobody get a brain damage from a little Hickory but you can make a brain damage or break somebody's neck or kill them by shaking them slapping them in the face I see one of you slapping in the face I'll try slapping you rather Dale you're not be that way I'm not that way I said old outside part of me you said well that's hard to fight it is but listen we say but brother Dale the soul is just the nature of the spirit it's not just the nature of the spirit he said well it's the nature of the spirit then we'll go that way but then a prophet comes along that's where we ended up talking about it talking about the real you see what you are huh and the prophet of God said on souls in prison 1963 11 10 the morning service what'd he say and I know where they pulled that one up or not no that's 44 you're on the you're on another quote you can run it backwards if you want to and we'll get to that one but what did he say he says the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit then when the nature of a man see yourself please just Nature's spirit then he's describing how and he said it wasn't that your body died it was that your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit diet see the nature which is the soul then what'd he say the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world well how can the nature be a nature that's where you're tied up at I don't have no problems the nature of my soul is being displayed this day now if I say something hateful that's the outside part of me because I do still believe that when you are born again you are still a human in the outward parts of you in the nature of your spirit and your body and controlled and motivated by this world but that inward part is God he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again so it wasn't your soul now watch what I'm saying it wasn't your soul that died see that would be you'd have to replace it with something it's the nature of that your spirit displays to your body so it wasn't your soul dying you don't take out put in another one that's exchange that's a close doctrine of the two Souls call it Exchange all right but the nature of what I was came out by the new birth justification sanctification that takes out that old nature of my being but it don't take out my being it just takes the nature of it away that's simple to me now I know I'm accused of being so deep until people can't understand now I'm so simple they can't understand me because I don't talk with education and that's what I think about right around them I listen to that man he don't talk with education he talks from the Holy Spirit that's with inside of him let's see what was that scripture the other day he was talking about we're talking about unto your and your children and to them that are far off or whatever they're in the scripture you know he said unto you Jews and your children Jews and then went far off he says Gentile and as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said both you and Gentile I sat there and cried that's so cynical tell me mankind are there some theologian simply saying you your children and them that are far off and the men is the Lord Our God shall call and you just put it in simple terminology simple terminology is your soul is you you are what you are you're not born again in your body and Spirits you have to be born again in your soul and to be born again in your soul is what the nature of that Soul has to die amen which is of the world and then God comes and lives in US now you got the new birth Paul summed it up by saying this Christ in you the hope of glory life that amen Amen in the flesh he said I'm motivated on the inside of me by this faith that came to me this Revelation this person that came to me to birth me and he said you beat me you do what you want to you try to drown me he said you can't do it look at that man beating like he was whatever three or four times in the deep and all this I beat when 40 Stripes saved one which it said 40 would kill you beaten to Pieces guts probably hanging out half the time because of those hooks at the end of that whip to cut and he said how can all things done that I may win Christ and being found in him not having my own what is a soul when God breathes the breath of life into your nostrils and you become a living Soul then you begin then that's on that same message of souls in prison think about it I'm trying to get you to see what a soul is and we I know right now see we're not going to get into what I want to do this evening so that's okay but the soul of man that's why I've tried to preach it to you that God had to come not send somebody else body to body he's my brother my kinsman redeemer Spirit to Spirit he can anoint my spirit and I can see things and they could in the Old Testament but soul to soul he could not get into them in the Old Testament because there was no way to drive that unclean Spirit out of them amen he couldn't come to them as a birth because there was no way to get their life out of them the best they could do is like David go and be in the bed with Bathsheba read your scripture on his way home he said Lord return unto me the joy of thy salvation even Schofield picks it up and says that see because down inside of that man was a soul which was that man and no matter how whether we'll get to it in a little bit whether it's sinner or saint that soul is a real you for what you are yeah but brother Dale I have these problems okay that's human elements we'll have problems in these human elements as long as we're in the human elements but what is your desire all right well I just can't help but go out and do that now you're getting into a problem when you say you can't help now you've got a problem because you're not yielding to what's inside of you that's right we'll get on to that more but think about it you just see what I'm talking about you what it's not that you become a soul that's what you are if we could ever get it out of our stinking heads to think this is something real that you're looking at yeah Matisse what here is tangible whatever get it to the place of realizing God is more real than that you mean Brothers God's got a place well the Bible says he's up in heaven Heaven's not their own Earth and my footstool what else would you build me but I just can't see God being real like you do why not you know why because you've never seen him right but I thought it was more blessed to what believe that have not seen I thought that was the Bible but why don't you open your eyes and look around just look around you're sometimes shut down and get one of them drawings that's off the doctor's office I sat there and look at that and I'm just amazed you sit there and you look at that thing that's all drawn out it's got all them Parts sir and every one of them's got a purpose come on everything bears you can live with some of them Parts yeah but that still don't make you right let's see God can bypass every bit of that sister Carly was living without a a pituitary how you call that big old word you know female part pituitary gland that she was supposed to have been a diabetic because there was nothing to supply and all at once she starts getting sick she goes to the doctor and he takes her off of the sugar medicine what you call it you know you know what she lived until she died without having to take that stuff you tell me what was supplying it well she happened to be born with a with a two pituitary glands I get sick I'm honest I get sick at mine in your stupidity you go to the doctor you come out and hear right here in this church walk outside and see if it ain't right go to the doctor and I say the doctor gave me a complete bill of health this week everything's right ninety percent of you is going to say well so until died because he went away to the doctor he had a complete he had a complete physical and he died two days later you were unbelief you're killing the word why because we're being stupid but so and so tired 30 minutes after on so what yeah you know what you're saying you're saying I don't have faith you're saying you don't have faith by speaking of our stupidity of what science says that's been on my mind for a year or two that's off they'll tell you you go outside what we have Services we have prior you go outside I got a good doctor this week I got an appointment doctor says I got sugar doctor said I got this and that or the other what do you say I thought God was dealing with what we said our confession I'm not telling you you're not sick I'm not a dummy you go to the doctor's office you walk in you explain to the doctor what's wrong with you right he gets paid for you telling him what's wrong with you right that's pretty dumb to start with but that's what happened but instead of saying God said it say that sometime to the doctor and watch him I told you about that time I went to one I asked him I said would you believe that for much my blood pressure has been running 160 something 190 and one over 110. and I said we prayed Sunday morning and I come up here Monday and now you say my blood pressure is 120 over 80. do you believe that the nurse said no I went in and told the doctor the doctor said no I don't believe it I come out and told my wife I should get me another doctor I ain't going back to him at least a doctor could say well things do happen he ain't going to do that right because he's losing patience like brother Hal Thomas years ago I don't remember where we was there or whatever but they prayed for him for for he's listening he'll know it they prayed for him for a kidney stone and the doctor done told him it's impossible to pass it it was too big so many centimeters whatever he called the doctor up and he said doc you say I got to get this out he said yep he said I got it in my hand you know what the doctor said don't tell nobody that way I'll lose all my patience something to that degree you say but come on I don't have to live I don't try to live a lie so when you call my house how am I doing my wife even get on to me and say you're going to the doctor tell him what's wrong with you you're going on I say hey Doc how you doing I asked him how he's doing that's the first thing try that sometime just try it and you walk in the office and the doctor comes up and he sticks your hand you say how you doing doc uh you say you call him doc yeah I call him doc cause that's what he is you call it my house and say hey Doc how you doing that means a person he puts his pants on just like mine but I'll just say he said well what's wrong with you I said well I got a bad cold or I'm hurting here am I hurting nothing wrong with that because you're telling him what's wrong with you right and then you take the medicine he gives you and you say thank you doctor but the medicine ain't going to heal me because God is the Healer and you watch him look at you huh but you might get one converted you know we're pretty good to go out and try to convert everybody else along we convert to a doctor okay get off of it listen the real you is what I'm talking to remember that Wednesday I'm not talking to your bodies good bodies is bodies we all got them we got problems Spirits are spirits we all got Spirits we all got problems but speaking to the soul of the individual and what it brought around say look at paragraph 44 are sold in prison then go ahead and pull that one up that's number one that Soul that's in diocy that soul is what God is working on watch if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then the nature dies the nature and the love of the world eyes and the things of the world if you can get that to just just get a person to stop then it's like we say we ask people we try to introduce the message what we try to do you understand the seals you understand the plagues of Halls of drugs well you're trying to make it look like you got something yeah the thing ain't God that's right right start talking to him on the godhead you don't have to jump into the water baptism ask brother dick there how long I talked to him before I brought up water baptism he was already saying himself I see it now it's not three persons extreme manifestations of God okay you believe that yeah I said okay I'm about this water baptism you might run in somebody like him that already been thinking about it you know God does work on both ends um but you see as I said the other day I've quoted over and over they said to brother Brandon what what must we do to be saved he said we tell them what not to do and what to do you know quit this quit that don't do this don't do that he said they didn't ask that question they asked what must we do to be saved repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's no promise any other way talking to the nature that part in there that's motivating us now let me explain a little bit your you realize every person we're going to get to this later don't bring it back you realize every person in the world that Brandon said is born with a gift a gift of faith an ability to believe no brother Wilson okay so glad see I was born special I can believe it you don't want to talk to me after service about that because I'll remind you of how long it took me to bury that down in there to get you to believe it because I know I'm hateful but is it the truth oh I saw it immediately I like sister Gail's way I come in fighting right you come in fighting you're going to stay you come in burning like crazy you're gonna be like a candle burn at both ends you're going to burn out in the middle and you're gone that's why people don't last too long in the message oh yes I see that oh I see that well I see that organization is wrong but what about the what about well I ain't going now I'm not going to go to that water baptism yet I just see organizations wrong you don't see it's wrong you just see the natural outwards yeah because the only way you can see anything about organization to be wrong is get bored again look what he says there on the same quote so therefore he has partnership you talking about the new birth going down to paragraph 45. he has partnership too you see and taken this man Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together that's not an anointing on your spirit he's talking about the man the being that we are that's all that we are any Partnerships you know what he says he says you and God together as persons he says a being what we really are listen what he goes on to say now let me yeah we'll buy fires trying to prove Satan to how real he is but you know that's what gets me I will say this and he'll come back this evening and pick that up you know we think God is just a spirit but the devil's real hello yeah I never heard nobody say the devil wasn't real have you oh have you ever heard anybody say the devil ain't real no he's real look what he called me to do well just remember God created him so God would be more real than he is we'll get back on that but I want to get on to the point or the real you that's what I'm talking about Wednesday night so we'll cover this go to number two brothers I know we I'm having to jump number two is the 65 1205 things that are to be and he's talking about this body being like an old coat that you wear uh you know different things coming down but go ahead you hang that thing up that's the way this whole body is you it's more the image of the heavenly it is not you I mean even the best we can do come on we're reading it Wednesday night around said what a hypocrite was he said it was in Pharisees that with their mouth they said they believed what he was saying but said with their heart they denied what he was a saying and that made him a hypocrite so something inside of them wouldn't write it is not you you are on the inside of that body how many times we heard the prophet say you've never seen me he said you see the body I inhabit okay you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection now he's explaining a Christian right because the inside is pulling it see bringing it in line with the word of God you're inside you yourself your being this body is just an old code and someday what will you do with it for it you was was only in the Garment for a while this is like the Earthly garment this body you your real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Branham you know Susie Jones or whatever it is okay going around to the last part of the that let me make sure I got it this one is the old coat they've just seen that inside of you with the old coat all right boy the image and watch you what I'm getting to is I'm down below but it's in in here the people just seeing you this and what you was your soul what you was your real you was on the inside of that the real you who is the real you the real you what's the real you it's what you are all right the real you is what you are see that's why that when we're of the world what do we do we live like the world right but when we're Christians see we're living in the world but not of the world come on we're not stupid are we we eat we drink we play we work we do we're all everything's of the world right everything we do is motivated by the world right but there's supposed to be something on the inside of there that's controlling us that's the real you real use not just this body out here right the real you is not your spirit the real use what's down on the inside whether it's good or bad that's what Jesus was talking about the Pharisees the real you was showing itself in the Pharisees when they would confess with their mouth we know that you are a man sent from God because nobody can do what you're doing except God be with him but we don't believe you are the Messiah right so who is he talking to yeah you know conference being the high priest could be such under the anointing because he would have praise and you know he prophesied we think it's just not a prophecy but he prophesied one day you think it was just him throwing Jesus to the garbage no he was prophesied he said it must needs be that one die for the sins of the people instead of all to die maybe he didn't use the word sin in there but just go ahead with the other right see he was prophesying he was the high priest but now if you think those things are not right you just answer to me one thing that man could speak under the anointing right he could walk in and see all of the things he was the high priest he could see the Shekinah Glory he could see the candle he could see everything he was a high priest and here's a man that he would admit that we can't argue with you about the signs and wonders nobody can do that unless it be of God put down inside of me something is telling me that you ain't right my body is going one way my anointing is going another way and I'm on the inside saying I'm going to kill you right what was motivating him it was not the great anointing that was on him to prophesy that's why brother Randall said you can't tell that woman that it's wrong for her to wire them shorts and things cut her hair he said because the anointing his owner right and inside of her something else inside of her was being displayed by her flesh the nature of her spirit was coming out to go wear the shorts and the higher you know the anointing on her most of you remember a woman that worked at the plant she was a woman preacher and she's you know and I talk with her constantly because I was not ridiculing her and hateful of arrogant ask her a simple question one day I said I said you believe the Bible says yes I said you say you're a woman preacher I said I'm not going to argue with you about it you know what I believe and you know what I don't believe God called you but that's all right if God called you that's your business that's between you and God but I said if he calls you to preach you've got to preach the truth she said yes I said what are you going to do with your hair in your clothes sometime that's all I asked her I wasn't hateful I'd go to her and say somebody to church is sick I called you know I almost called her name 15 times but all right she wouldn't know I'd say we got so and so sick at the church he'll pray for him hey I believe she's anointed and under her anointing she could touch God come on I ain't talking no woman preacher why are you afraid come on but you see what was the inside of her overrode what was outside of her she hit the lottery one day for two thousand dollars she never would tell me she hit the lottery she wouldn't do it everybody else were rejoicing over Nails blessing from God I said her name then her blessing from God you know she was blessed she got two thousand dollars but she never told me and ain't no blessing from God that might be your blessing from your God but it ain't mine all right listen what are we the people just seeing you this you remember Wednesday night we were talking about the LIE detector's test a lot of texture tests won't do and that's not your body new spirit come on you say but your spirit no that's that real part of you on the inside you take that lie detectors test that thing on the inside it's going to click click click and you remember what we were talking about Wednesday night um I was quoting a while ago the uncertain sound he said but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called The Soul and this intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system the soul is the one that can't lie and get by with it he said in your subconscious Blaze we see we take all of those terminologies and we think well we're we're you talk about something real but see we think this is real it was not the body we'll get to it you see it was not the body of Jesus that went to hell right right he was his soul amen doing not his body that come back on the day of Pentecost it was not a spirit to anoint it was his soul the person of his being right but you see Church we want to try to make it just something's that is not real come on I hope you get that if you don't get nothing out of what I'm saying you know one thing for sure brother Dale believes in a real God and he believes in a real being he believes in a person that you are and that's the part I try to deal with we'll have trouble with these bodies in these Spirits as long as we live but yet that Soul inside of there is going to live on somewhere if nothing else to live on till Judgment Day and then God will do it remember Wednesday if you're not him that can destroy the body I fear him that they can destroy the soul the real you see this is just something I live in this will be laid down in death if I don't come to the change but if I come to the change this is not going to be laid down this is going to be changed why because something on the inside of the inside is of God not just an anointing on your spirit to make you feel good and Shout that's wonderful you don't love with your body Your Love with your spirit you display love with your body your spirit is what causes a love factor to work but your soul is what you really are either the nature of my soul is of God or it's of the world right what do we think about it come on brother the real you 'll have to do a two-part of this this evening but I was talking about what I want to get to the point to see that your soul being the real you that the prophet of God said your soul is your theophany then we want to put it all the way up yonder that's automatic just throw it up well the prophet said it yeah but what about the things he said about life what about when he was referring to beyond the curtain of time and he said the angel of the Lord said this is sold under the altar crying how long but brother Dan we know we got that straightened out now I'm quoting 65. we'll get to it this evening I'm quoting 1965. you say within the shields sold 100 still sealed you I ate just a minute there is a definition in that that makes it to show who they are going under the fifth sealed you read your scripture it says Souls crying how long how long to avenge our blood he said see there that is not the bride because she doesn't want vengeance but you can use this souls in prison crying how long hello bless the bride see that's where we don't keep it straight like we're talking about Wednesday night Revelation 7 brought around says in one quote he says that's not the bride and two times after then he says it was the bride well boy he was massively confused no no no no you and me is the one that's vastly confused but but Revelation 7 is over after Revelations 10 he is now you want to talk we like to quote Revelation 10 7 right Revelation 10 7 is five chapters after the Rapture six chapters matter of fact but we love Revelation 10 7. you see that's where we take that thing and that Soul down inside of there says wait a minute there's something wrong longing for a truth it's not your body it's spirit that longs for the truth it's that inside of there why didn't run around and say you go out here and you see the people he said that little woman he said the reason she went into the world he said because the church was the deceiving part and since she turned to prostitution oh because the church couldn't bring her to Christ well I told that brother at that time he said I taken my wife or took her to a Pentecostal Church to get her free in the spirit I said brother you hold it just a minute now you tell me a Pentecostal church can get them free in the spirit to get the Holy Ghost when our true born-again Christian believing the message of the hour and preaching it can't get it to him oh but see we want to make it so good because you see I hit him right in the head with it because see he was thinking she's got to be free and you're not free at Lula she wants to shout and scream and holler hey man well why did the new birth the new birth is a birth of the word not shouting and screaming and hollering I believe in it you say brother Dale you you're just not emotional like everybody else you don't know me I'm more emotional than anybody in this building but I just don't make it in front of you I make mine to God into God Alone because I'm not trying my best to convince you of anything I've smelled his presence I've heard his voice I've I don't have to deny because his 40 Years of telling you about it but yet that Soul down inside of you is what I'm talking to to get you to listen to the word there's a prophet said then if that soul will just stand still long enough and listen to the word then the nature of it will go out see that's what justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost does burns out all of that according to the Future home 15 16. the future home you'll read that message sometimes we think it's all talking about some World we're going to he said I want one thing to get to you and that's to plan a Salvation but he said it is one thing that the soul of the individual goes through the same thing the world goes through yet he was trying to preach Redemption what about it let's stand number 25 in the spiral book number 25 on the spiral book you forgive me of my actions and reactions of anything sounds hateful but listen church I'm just tired not physically I'm tired of us playing little sugar tit Doctrine ideas my crazy with this feeling then they're feeding your britches lady God had somebody to say that to you I do that to you to see what you would do I have to fight that one all the time to see what I would do you mean I failed at that yes I didn't take it correctly what about it what about that soul in there like I said the other night you think brother Dale you just don't preach simple and get the people in the altar you go back with me in the message and preach souls in prison and see the order is full great Revelation now orders are full our eyes am I right anybody have a need oh yeah I Surrender together father we thank you for this day and we just committed into your hands believe in you that you'll just lead and guide us forgive us Lord of our ways and our actions and talks that are not according to you but yet Lord let that that's what down in the hearts of each and every one of us come to a realization that we're talking about something real not talking about just spirits and just ideas and thoughts but talking about a real reality of a living God and a reality of a living people that even in our fallen estate Lord we're in your image because we're crucial creators we're people Lord not just adults Lord just help us help us to be as you want us to be Lord we love you we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed remember the service this afternoon let my blessings fall on me
