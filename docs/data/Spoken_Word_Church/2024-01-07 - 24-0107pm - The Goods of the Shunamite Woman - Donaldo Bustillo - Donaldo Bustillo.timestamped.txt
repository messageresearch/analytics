[0:04] good afternoon
[0:06] Saints all praise be to
[0:11] God I want to give an update on my
[0:17] knee I didn't fall at work um I didn't
[0:22] stumble I didn't hit
[0:25] it I just squatted
[0:28] down to get a bag off the bottom shelf
[0:32] of my
[0:35] trolley and I felt a little
[0:39] something and I worked the rest of that
[0:45] trolley and then I went on to my next
[0:49] [Music]
[0:51] trolley and within that
[0:56] hour it swelled
[0:58] up
[1:02] like a
[1:03] [Music]
[1:04] balloon the pain was
[1:09] increasing by the
[1:13] minute it hurt to put the ice pack on
[1:20] it so I went to the
[1:25] medical and um what happened was
[1:30] a soft tissue
[1:35] sprain now I couldn't put any pressure
[1:37] on that
[1:42] leg Kendrick brought me
[1:46] home and he had to help
[1:50] me I put out on the WhatsApp for y'all
[1:52] to help me
[1:58] pray for the pain
[2:02] I went back oh kendri came
[2:05] home the next
[2:07] day from work and I was walking
[2:12] around and he said how are you even
[2:19] walking and I said it's the prayer of
[2:22] the
[2:25] sa
[2:27] hallelujah amen amen and I haven't taken
[2:30] any pain medication although they wanted
[2:32] me
[2:37] to the second thing I want to share with
[2:40] you
[2:43] is to me it's an air of
[2:49] Supernatural I was working at
[2:53] wacovia in Buckhead in
[2:56] bu had to be the work at 7:00 in the
[2:59] morning
[3:03] and I'm speeding up
[3:06] 400 and I noticed a brand new
[3:13] Cadillac and I don't recall a license
[3:16] plate on
[3:19] it maybe a dealership
[3:24] plate so of course I passed it and I I
[3:26] thought
[3:28] maybe
[3:31] it was a health
[3:35] issue cuz the car acted like it didn't
[3:38] know where it was
[3:45] going and I looked
[3:48] over at the man that was
[3:54] driving to make sure he was
[3:58] okay he looked over at
[4:03] me and I kept
[4:07] going I pulled into the parking
[4:12] lot and he pulled in beside in back of
[4:18] me now my woman radar went
[4:25] up he came
[4:28] over to my
[4:32] window I rolled it down just a little
[4:36] bit and he
[4:39] said
[4:41] ma'am don't you think you were going a
[4:43] little too
[4:46] fast and I said yes
[4:49] sir he said you want to slow it
[4:56] down you want to be careful
[5:02] he got in his
[5:05] car and he
[5:08] disappeared now I look to my
[5:11] left to see if he was going to
[5:16] park I looked to my
[5:19] right and I saw the tail lights and they
[5:22] just
[5:26] went now the air of Supernatural
[5:32] to me let me describe this
[5:37] man brand
[5:39] new black
[5:42] suit white shirt you
[5:46] know Black
[5:51] Tie but what he looked
[5:56] like it was a black man
[6:02] older close cut
[6:05] hair see some
[6:09] gray but y'all his
[6:13] skin was
[6:16] Flawless no signs of Razor ever hit that
[6:23] face were
[6:26] perfect his
[6:28] eyes had a I don't know
[6:32] bluish every
[6:35] color
[6:39] everything and that's what made me think
[6:41] it was a supernatural
[6:46] visit why was this car on the highway at
[6:49] 7 o' reminds
[6:51] you work
[6:53] this this was 6:30 in the
[6:56] morning I looked at this man like what
[6:59] meeting is he going to at this time of
[7:01] the
[7:04] morning and he doesn't know how to get
[7:09] there I took
[7:12] that as a
[7:17] message and that's why I said it had a
[7:19] supernatural air to
[7:24] me never saw him before
