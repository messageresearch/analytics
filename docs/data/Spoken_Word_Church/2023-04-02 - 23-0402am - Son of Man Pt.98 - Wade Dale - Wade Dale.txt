yesterday last night that I had not previously seen before just remember too that was spring breaks coming up people are going there's about 10 or 7 June and and Deanna are leaving today going to Florida and me and Thomas are leaving going to Illinois so we're going in two different directions um be gone until Wednesday so we're going to do some work I'd rather work on the hunting camp and go to the beach anyway so hey praise the Lord some people say but the lease is back there going no if the hunting club was at the beach no I wouldn't even go there either brother Aaron to be preaching for us Wednesday night all right on this coming weekend the seventh which will be Friday Good Friday brother Dutch Scott will be with us we start at seven o'clock all right seven o'clock all right the next day on the 8th it'll be three o'clock we'll have a fellowship meeting brother Tom Christian has already said he's coming I have not heard from Brother Homer some of the other ones brother Tony and the different ones that were previously in the fellowship meeting had other things planned during that weekend so but we're going to have a fellowship I mean three o'clock and as June posted on WhatsApp you need to get with her our sister Esther and figure out the the food for that day and brother Chris long will be here that Saturday and then also Sunday we'll have only one service and it'll be Easter morning uh service regular service 9 45. um that's a good Sunday school this morning wasn't it good sounds good always there that's why we keep saying ever since always a good sentence so all right now so then April the 16th which will be a few Sundays from now that's brother Dale's birthday he perked up when I said April 16th it'll be brother Dale's 83rd birthday so we're gonna have a party for him after the second service all right after second service we'll have a birthday party for brother Dale on April the 16th be 83 years old so if you want to give him a gift that would be wonderful we'll have cake and ice cream all right also now remember on the 30th April the 30th last Sunday of this month brother Willie Smiley will be here now he is the brother-in-law of brother Jack Duff that was here a couple weeks ago and he's he's a smiley he's he's a big black guy about that tall but he's a big man and he really appreciated us I hadn't talked to him in several years and he really was excited about coming so he'll be here on April the 30th uh after second service today we'll have Community foot washing um also I sent out that WhatsApp about Father's Day and I didn't get any replies but one so fathers you all need to think about what we want to do I did look at that cabin that we used to get in Helen it is available that weekend of Father's Day so if you'd like to do that again we need to discuss that among ourself and uh see if we want to do that or or go over to the uh to the pond like we did last year so we'll we'll decide on that but just be thinking about it also I know all of you uh we've been um working with the group in Ohio for now almost two years uh they came out of a church that um there was some disagreement with Doctrine and and most of you know the the details but you don't need to know the details all of them they just left the church because of certain things all right and then their dad had already left and he had been watching us online since like 2015 and he's been trying to get them I mean the suns are always a little bit hard-headed except me and and uh Donnie we can't say that can't we it's okay but they were a little bit hard-headed and a little slow they're not watching in today they're doing something different today but yeah slow too but um they came to watching us online now most of you know the back side of it now that they're they watch us every service they send their tithe to us religiously religiously they send their tithing they send their offerings and their gifts to us whatever we need they're a part of this church all right but they don't have a pastor and they consider us to be the pastor of of the group up there of about 14 people and they have a couple of extra ones that are coming now so back several months ago it well actually when we went up there in July when all of us went in July I kind of got all the men together in the church and I told them I said look I said you guys need a pastor it's okay to watch online and it's okay to you know there's a lot of people doing in the message but I don't agree with it not for a length of time not for a length of time temporary not a problem but a length of time you need somebody to look you in the eye that's why I take Ministries and stuff like that no no don't work well the Bible said it wouldn't work you can't be perfected that way so you got to have somebody and brother Ryan tells us that a pastor has to be the Shepherd in other words he's even got to smell like a sheep but they know him by his smell because he lives with him brother Ryan says the pastor lives with his people all right so it has to be um even in the absence you know brother Dale there then you've got there somebody's got to be taking this thing and keep going all right because we are sheep we and I need it as much as you need it we we need a head we need a pastor we need somebody we can go talk to somebody that we can can relate with and somebody that on Sunday he gets on you to a little bit on you a little bit about some of the things that's going on because he does have discernment and he does have part of the fivefold ministry the pastor kind of covers all those and we know that but we don't cover them all in his fullness that's why we bring people in to evangelists and teachers and different ones if we can find a prophet we bring him in but you've got those different Falls that that me as being this every Sunday but you got to have that every Sunday service for your recharging and for somebody to you know be with you and and nurture you in in the Lord I kind of wanted to get to that last night in the Bible study about planting seed but um we'll get to it maybe later on so I told him I said you can't have you can't consider me or or the ministry of this church that can't be a pastor for a length of time temporarily yes but from where they came out of there are several churches in Ohio but they all teach the same thing for what they came out of so they can't pull from the pool of people in another church or or a pastor didn't come out or a minister didn't come out and say well I don't agree with brother so and so I'm going to start my own church they just came out and then so fell in love with a ministry here and as brother Isaac he'd they'll be watching this later on will tell you they were they realized sitting under the ministry of this church now I'm talking about all now they've listened to brother Dale since 2015. and going on back to Family Matters and all the different series that we've been preaching for since the 2010 I think it was they're sitting there watching and bringing it up online from the website so they're not sitting there not doing anything they're wanting but they realized they were so far behind that they needed to catch up and I told him I said if you're going to catch up you're going to have to need somebody to pastor this church because I can't do it I've seen people there's a brother that does it in Tennessee and when he gets older he will not be able to do it he passes the church on Saturday and then he passes the church on Sunday that is not the way the Bible set up that is not the way brother Branham set it up that's not the way I don't think God set it up either all right now if you have to watch online like this people like sister Johnny sister Freda different ones that's okay and we have people streaming right now that can't get to this church but it's because they can't get to this church it's not because they want to sit in their slippers and watch online see that's easy to do there's no overcoming we had to overcome to get here amen we had to overcome to get up this morning to get here and then what we're going to do sit here and just listen to me ramble no I believe God's give you something to listen to and something to take into your heart and then what live it yeah go after the door we've always sat down greatest gift we can give brother damn we can put his picture on the wall on your wall we can give him cars and boats and planes plane that's one thing we haven't got planned but listen we can give him all that and that's fine and that makes life happy and that makes everything good and cozy but he'd rather see you live it and for you to be come to that headship where no one else will come to he wants to preach you to that and then he can sit back and look at it and say I have done my job as Paul said I've done my job I've run my race I there's before me a Crown of Life and to me that's why uh and and I was listening to brother Donnie this morning just for a little while brother Johnny Reagan and he was preaching on the same basically the same thing but he said a successful pastor is not somebody that can tickle your feelings it's not somebody that can make you feel good or or cozy in warm it's a pastor that can get you born again bottom line it's a pastor that can get you born again if you and brother down started with 12. then we've had other people come in you know other ministers and different ones but not a pastor so we can see this is the fruit of what has been preached as we were trying to get to the seed last night because the seed is the word it's the word being sown all right not a not a sperm or a little seed something Little Dot floating around in your body somewhere but he's preached the word of God and people not people Christians have been come from that um as a testimony I'll tell you this and it's going to surprise Mom and Dad we were sitting yesterday at Cafe I sat with them old men sorry I sat with them old man and then when I get up they said where are you going I said I'm going to work so you don't have to and they say just keep going so I can get my check but we were sitting there talking about um my cousin Terry was talking about how long our church had been because the Methodist Church is fixing to just split wide open there's going to be some church buildings available because there some people said they're quitting the Methodist they're not going to they're going to dissolve a certain part of it and dad's brother Marshall is one of the ministers that's that's very prominent in this area everybody knows Marshall Dale and he's been here before so we were talking about churches and Terry pops up and he says well brother he said that he said Samuel which is his uncle said he did it right said he just bought the church to begin with said he'll have to see throw everybody out and he had to keep it to South I said well that'll work that way he said I know he said I drove by the other day and he said your parking lot was so full and he said I like that so he said well when did the church get established I said well in 1971 and my other cousin Roy Turpin was sitting over there across from me and he popped up and he said no it wasn't and I thought how you know you weren't here he said no he said that church started at General Motors because he worked at GM with that he said that church started General Motors said he was preaching to a group of people some of them's already passed over by the cauley's a recipient of it brother dick brother Al uh Brother Dean different ones brother Tom they all worked at GM so that so he popped up and said no I didn't start in 1971 he said it's 30 when he started preaching they'd take they'd have 30 minute lunch and they would have church meeting I don't know if they eat or not it probably it didn't matter they ain't worried about but brother Dale then gathered a group together and then they just brought him up here so it was good to know there's a testimony of a man that never stepped foot in this church which was Roy which is he's a Methodist but he he knew one thing's for sure that brother Dale had started Church before he started this one he started it down at General Motors and just brought it here so that's a good that to me that's a testimony and then and um of the of the longevity too of like as brother Donnie said a real Pastor stays with the people helps them grow and they sure they grow in numbers but I want to grow in stature not statue stature all right to where we can be a Powerhouse for God and that's why we've been talking for now 98 sermons on this so let me get to the uh what I want to tell you there was no one that was um I wasn't going and Bob and them's not going it's be hard to move to Ohio so from July till yesterday I'd been working with them and working on getting this rectified or getting a solution to their to their issue try to get them to cut the cord if you might say I not so much cut to court and we never hear from them or see them again but they elected a pastor yesterday and it was uh brother Isaac Negron now he's been see we've been trying to keep this a little bit under wraps tonight people yeah I hate that can't we just get behind him we just get behind him just get behind him forget about all this other junk call us yak but he has been speaking for several months since January actually um on like a three-month basis and I've been listening in and and uh and kind of nurture name up and then the whole church agreed that they needed a pastor and that he could fulfill that without uh having us be every service they have to to watch in all right so there the name now they named the church a long time ago but it's a lighthouse of Refuge in Lorain Ohio so that's what they're going under now Lighthouse of Refuge I think brother Aaron denim um a plaque so we've been kind of working toward that I know I know some of you may not agree with what we were doing but you know what I'm not going to ever leave anybody behind never will I put somebody in a boat and shove them out I'm glad God didn't put you in a boat and shove you out in the water and said fend for yourself help we're here to help the body we're here to help the body not cut the parts off all right so we're just going to pray for brother Isaac and and I'm going to go up probably in three or four weeks and and speak with them and they've already got the church set up they set it up just like ours they've been paying tithe here so now the tithe will be going to the ministry there at the Lighthouse of refuge and brother Isaac will be the pastor there so we will they're still going to stream in uh listen those guys let me tell you what they do how they on Sunday morning they watch us no not today but they watch Us online Sunday morning Sunday afternoon they stream Us in and then they go and and go to the archive sermons and pull up another one so they're like three and four sermons a day Wednesday night Wednesday night they they stream and then they go home and listen to a service uh whatever like brother Dale preaching on um I can't remember the one that but the seals and the different things they listen extra so they know they're not dilatory they're not people that that I don't trust I trust him so I trust listen I trust their decision because listen I'm like what brother Brown said the pastor's only got one vote sure he's the final say sure he's the headship of the church but he's just got one vote you have the vote you are the ones that put people in and take people out not one person except the Lord Jesus by the holy spirit so they voted him in yesterday and I appreciate him and I love him with the love of the Lord so let's stand our feet we'll get started I just want to let you know because you know send them some Atta boys and send them some you know um I don't believe in luck but send them some prayers send them some blessings and say we're behind you we're with you there like I said they're still going to stream in uh I think on Wednesday night now they're going to stream it stream Us in to keep going um so Isaac doesn't have to preach so much three or four times I don't see how in the world brother Dale did it just getting two services on Sunday it's killing me and he got two services on Sunday one on Wednesday had no backup no help he had the lead singing and he worked 40 something hours at General Motors and drove an hour and a half down an hour and a half back so praise God Rest Ranch for a little while unless some of us Young Folks do something but they're going to stream in they're always going to be a Bible study so we haven't wasted our money to to zoom uh uh they're still going to be with the Bible study with us and um like I said streaming on Wednesday and then they will be watching online but not live because today is the first day that brother Isaac is speaking to the people there at in Lorraine so we appreciate the Lord we appreciate what he's done for us we appreciate that we've had a pastor for 50 years we hadn't had to go look for one amen so we've got we've been blessed we've been blessed we all have been blessed and I hope that goes in a testimony somewhere [Applause] today if y'all know what I mean that do know what I mean Lord bless your sister Barbara good to have you with us today so y'all know where we're going with that all right so we're gonna speak today just for a minute and then we will uh uh try to maybe get the bulk of it this afternoon so let's buy our heads yes ma'am so he's out of the nest what as of today I ain't getting it yes I'll still be working with them personally yes okay yeah like 30 minutes this morning on the phone yeah before I got here yeah so I mean yeah they're babies and like I said the cord's been cut but you still once you cut the cord you still got to feed the youngin all right you still got to die for him and you got to put you know you got to put you can't he can't find his own food so he gotta feed him a little bit so know that we will not cut them off at all it's just that the importance of them having a pastor has been taken away from this church and had been placed on them to take care of some of their issues and things that they have because uh we all have issues we all have things and and really pray for him because it's family all right so just keep them in prayer so let's pray Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the people that we have here the purchase of your blood Lord and I thank you Father is today that the Lighthouse of Refuge starts up as we were talking last night a new Administration is starting a new chapter Lord I pray that you would anoint our brother Lord the song leader and anoint the ones Lord that are playing instruments anoint brother Isaac Lord to bring the message to the people and may Satan not have any hold or be able to get his claws you know he's going to try Lord I pray that you'll protect him Lord as a baby put your arms around them Lord and wrap them in your love father just be with us and same thing here wrap us in your love Lord let us not have a malice and strife and Lord getting into godliness and and brotherly kindness we're going to cover that Lord that that the sweetness of the of the Holy Spirit should always Trump anything that's going on and I pray that you'll be with us Lord and furthermore this service be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here maybe the ones that are watching in Lord that can't get here I pray that you'd helped him or to get through whoever they're getting through and they can come back to service father Lord I pray this should be with each one that's that's leaving I know brother Ryan and them different ones are gone uh be with them Lord as they travel back today be with us as we travel every many people on spring break vacations I pray that you just be with us and bring us back together in you be brother Aaron on Wednesday night Lord as he brings the message and Lord bless this coming weekend Lord Lord we honor the resurrection every Sunday but this is a special time a time that we're we're going to listen to your Servants of God speak to us about you Lord I pray this should be brother Chris and brother Dutch give them travel mercies get here and back home and ever be with us Lord we pray in Jesus name amen yeah I I just I want you to uh just pray for him pray for pray for the people pray for each one they've already established they've got deacons they've got um trustees they used our same Charter and um so they're just kind of filling in those parts and so they have everything pretty much set up already we've been working on that it's not just something we called yesterday and said this is what we need to do we've been working since July so and I didn't want to burden any of you with it and I didn't want to hear your anything about it I just want to hear positive things they're a body they're a bride listen I I wish we had that Zeal all of us had the same Zeal to listen to three or four tapes a day to make to know that we're a little bit behind and we got to catch up and not miss a service all right and they've been working on well sister Melissa's been taking piano lessons so they're working toward you know having a service where they've got instruments and and some of you that's watched them or they've got plenty of instruments to play with they just didn't have a piano player so sister Melissa took it upon herself to take piano lessons so she they're buying her a piano small like we got the Cleveland over downstairs and they're buying her a small piano and she's learning how to play and then this afternoon they're gonna all practice song so they're not just sitting up there on their heels they are doing something for God so we're just going to put our shoulder to the wheel with them and we're going to ask the Lord to anoint them as a church right so this is part 98 in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth II Peter 1 says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness and we'll try to get the godliness this afternoon first Timothy 3 16 it says without controversy we're going to look at that because it says without controversy no argument great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit saint of angels preaching to the Gentiles believed on in this world received up into glory and I'm not adding to the word I'm going back to John 1 1. that word became flesh again in a group of people amen you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word and we know that God had a plan and a purpose and let me read making a way brother Ryan talks here in 1956. he said Jesus died for one purpose and that was to save those who God foreknew would be saved we kind of went through that a little bit in a Bible Study last night and and the Really the good thing about Bible study is is you can broaden for two hours you can broaden the subject created just me trying to hit for knowledge just for a few seconds if you'd have been here last night I wouldn't have to cover this again because we could usually we try to we cover don't we don't we cover what we're I'm going to preach on the next day or even Bible and his in his Sunday school class different ones so and you know what to me that's the Lord because we don't get together like a school and all the all the instructors get together and we said well no we're all going to preach on this right here no we don't do that we don't discuss that all right we let the Lord do it for us and he brings everything together and makes it perfect and that was to save those who God for knew would be saved now remember he would not that people be lost he would that all be saved and come to the glory of the Lord but he knew that there's some people that as I've said many times before the way to understand foreknowledge is to know that God knew it even if he gave Hitler a million years if he let him live let's just say Ten Thousand Years he never would come to repentance because God could see that remember he's infinite he can see all the way past what we can see so he could see that some as we were talking last night some come to a Justified State and a Sanctified State and God knew they couldn't go any further so maybe he'd take them off the scene so they have to don't have to go through the tribulation we were discussing uh this morning or last night brother George that we talk about people that we've been around all of our life and all of a sudden they fall over dead or we've got a family member that that that's just good Christian person then they die and we're so sorrowful but we ought to look at it a different way God has pretty much preserved them in the state they were in put them in a grave put their soul in another dimension and they ain't got to worry about tribulation period they don't have to worry about any of that they just got to worry about coming up to watch on judgment and if they're good to the bride they'll be given eternal life everybody with me with that to me that's the Glorious thing about Grace Grace is not only just to the bride it's not just only the Christians it's the people that are around you that God knows he's going to give eternal life to that we we don't but he does and he is so Sovereign that he can take somebody out of the way so he let Adolf Hitler live his life and then take his own life as they say knowing that if even if Adolf Hitler would have been given another 10 years another 20 years he would have never changed from what he was see to me that's the Providence of God by foreknowledge not putting him in a tube and pulling him through it now about with me on that God did not do that with anybody he did not put him in a tube and make him a robot and say well this is the way it's going to be no he saw your choice to me that's the simplest thing he saw your choice because we choose and I was telling him last night listen even when we get in the Millennium even when we get in the future home we still got to make a choice do I want to go out of the city or do I want to stay here do I want to eat that fruit or do I not want to eat that fruit do I want to go visit brother darty well that's two thousand miles brother Donnie's house I'll be there in about that right there so it doesn't matter that's right God knew there was going to be somebody saved and there had to be a preparation now what is a preparation that's a plan or as we said before a plan is a method of achieving an end so God is as brother Brown tells us that God has a threefold purpose we go back in the back part of God's mind and we see that God had a plan and a purpose well what was it planning the purpose to get us back to Heaven Amen to get us back to the Garden of Eden because remember all God was reported to Christ poured into church took her back to the Garden of Eden he didn't leave her listen he's not leaving us down here he's taking somebody home amen everybody with me and there had to be a preparation or a way made for them to be saved if there wasn't salvation wasn't possible if God foreknew that people would be saved knowing who they were he had to lay a plan down yes and we'll talk about that maybe this afternoon if we get to it election you have to bring election in all right same way with today today you may be born again but still under election you got to decide whether you want to climb this Jacob's Ladder or just stay the Way You Are you choose that you know what the preaching does the preaching just what brother I'm saying open scales to your eyes so you see what God's already done not what God's coming up what God's already done and then you make your choice from that you're still making you're making a choice right now yeah yeah everybody's making choices why does he say he's not willing and then he should perish he isn't he isn't willing that it should pair any should perish but did all might come to repentance but the or in order to be God he has to know who will and who won't or he wasn't God because he's omnipotent I'm I'm the president omniscient he knows every everything he's at every and all powerful so foreknowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing all these marvelous days that we're living in now listen knowing that even people like Paul and the different ones that were in the first church age they come to a a conclusion or come to a revelation that God was not going to come right then now they preached and it's in the Bible talks about to the coming of the Lord but brother Brown tells us that Paul was trying to get each the Corinthians and them to realize God wasn't coming in their generation God had work to do to seven Church ages and there John stood in that first church age John the Revelator and watched the church ages unfold so he knew that God wasn't coming during his lifetime but now you and somebody you and me and me that's right that's not our conclusion that's not our Administration our Administration has changed our Administration says we're not going by the grave somebody is going to go up not down you got you and you know what you got to decide whether it's you or not so God made a preparation before the foundation of the world he had this plan and the plan is perfect and as we were talking last night somebody had asked the question was is as you start when you start your Christian Journey uh what happens to this group that dies before the um change what happens to these people that have changed the body and what happened to the food's virgin so we got the little chart out that we done and I think Joe's got some pictures of it if you want it uh I know it's online of the Journey of a Christian that journey of actually it's a journey of everybody it's the whole Plan of Redemption say tell them where we go but the people in the end time let's hone in on that the people in the end time today we have a we have a mandate or our Administration tells us that we have got somebody has got to come to a body change so it's not going to be though that there's an x on the calendar and when we get to that day somebody's going to be changed all that's left alive is going to be changed that's not the way God does things that's not the way he put his plan together he put his plan together to send us a prophet in the end time to put the word of God together and then he had big nuggets and we break it down into little nuggets and then you take it and you eat the book right and when you eat the book you realize that we have to have these virtues listen one more time we say well this was just for the end time no it's not from right here down was in the first church age they had these virtues working in their life listen working in their churches when we get to brotherly kindness that's where you're gonna feel it the Bible says they had all things common they brought everything they owned in oh yes right and distribute it out evenly to everybody get ready for your pensions but Michael don't have no pension yet you gotta share with him brother College said all right he'd be the only one in the whole building and say all right but that's probably kindness and you know two people got in trouble and died because they didn't show brotherly kindness for those of you that didn't hey man I'll tell you who it was 99 cents to fire they owned the pieces of properties oh yeah here here's my property here's my here's my property but there was one piece of property they kept in their pocket right and the Holy Ghost discerned that and they died because of it all right just telling you that's what brother Brown talks about brotherly kindness read that now God comes down to cool of the day now look that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost we're gonna fly through this it's a father again God the Father dwelling in you look working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working what through you making you a co-worker so we got to be where as we were talking about vulcanization we've got to be vulcanized to what we're talking about right now amen all right are you going to get left behind there is a there is a movie called Left Behind it's going on right now but you're left behind is going to be worse than they're left behind because you know too much you can't be a foolish virgin and sit in this church I promise you that foreign giving you a place giving you a part of your Fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes Abode there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls that's what the matter with the meetings today there's not enough Spirit touching it to go for the souls of the Lost and the dying it's more like making a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul-winning program how pitiful I'm just reading what the brother what brother Brown said now brother rammstead and in Christ Mission Gardnerville said look back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve now he saw the picture unfold he saw the plan unfold because it was in his mind can't change that's right can't change he knows who did and who did who I mean who would who wouldn't but we don't that's right that's why they asked brother around said well brother Brown if God knows everything why are you preaching he said I throw the net out he said I get frogs lizards and I get fish every once in a while all right so that doesn't do away with Ministry it makes it more important now back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and going to achieve and look he had a motive in doing it brother Robert said check your motive and objective God's motive and objective was was to get us out of this condition that we're in right now praise God get us out of this condition that we're in right now why do we want to stay in this condition in order to let himself be expressed through what stars moon no you yes right amen that's and by with me join his great mind he wanted this now if it stayed in his mind he wasn't God if it stayed in his mind he wasn't God but he had to let it Loose because you and I were in there the bride was in there even the foolish version even the people that are given a cup of water they were in his mind but as we were man brother Joe Canada were talking about the sections of a book there's a lounge Book of Life and then there's an eternal section you can be taken out of one but you can't be taken out of the other Judas was taken out of one but once you're put in the Eternal section Revelations 13 8 you can't lose right and there's not there's not a book and an angel up there racing your name it's just telling where you and I can understand what's going on when we get to the watch on judgment and we judge others we're not going to have a book right here and it just go well no you know what you'll know if you missed it you'll know why you missed it you'll know why you're standing right here and not standing right here get quiet on me that's okay you'll know God will not have to tell you why you didn't make it you will know why you didn't make it brother Brown said there'd be a still Small Voice tell you you missed it wow wow let's continue on let's skip that we know about deep call of the deep there's got to be something at once there's something there's something desirous of man about wanting to be more like God it's just that we do it with as Bob said we we take our passion and we put it on this that or the other instead of God we all have a thirst for for a being that's like I want to talk to this y'all I know some of you are not from here but there was an atheist went to the meeting at the Lewis city council right up here well I know the mayor he's a he's a nominal Christian man he works for the post office too but he wouldn't allow he said a prayer and he wouldn't allow the atheist atheists to say a prayer I said why are atheists even praying what are they praying to an atheist don't believe in a superior being I thought if I was there that's what I got going okay buddy who you praying to let me know who you praying to because you have just not you have just become an unatheist if you have a being that you pray to you have because an atheist doesn't believe in no God they actually believe that they are the the you are the higher intelligent higher power I'd really like to talk to him about that but that's just the way the world is and they still having issues with it up there Genesis 5 22 says Enoch walked with God after he got Methuselah I want y'all to understand something too we've um there was a question yesterday or last night after the Bible study about um the moment of silence now we got to remember when we keep our types correctly Enoch type 2. the bride know what type what if it was virgin right they had to go over the tribulation all right and then come out Enoch walked with God and left so all that that connects with the Seven Seals and all the different things that connects with Enoch that does not connect with Noah so you can't type them together you gotta type them separate because people say oh yeah we got in the safety of the Ark and Noah no Noah tie it the foolish virgin Enoch type the bride all right so let's keep everything straight but you know what with God there is nothing we know about Enoch except he walked he walked with God and was not for God took him what are you saying walk with God amen amen and as I was saying last night when we get to the patients in just a few minutes patience is not you sitting on your honey waiting on God to bring you something with your shoes on your slippers on and you got your feet propped up in your house well bro wait and the Bible says for us to be patient Paul says run with patience this race that's right yeah the man has anybody ever seen a race where everybody sit in the couch I've seen them idiots try to get on the couch and put wheels on it race it down the road I said idiots sorry about that but um that would be if you put wheels on a on a couch so these are the generations of Noah and always a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God so God's power to transform watch what brothers Brown says this is the new one I put in here we were talking about last night here we go back to I'm sorry that I'm referring to last night but there was so much within that two hours that I'm covering today that um they would have helped you if you'd have been here um we were talking about a corn plant coming up and we have maypops everybody know what a map is I know some of us older ones know because we used to throw them at each other and they would pop that's why they're called made pops they grow on a vine they have this real pretty flower but they will literally pull your corn to the ground because they have runners but that little thing about that big round that's caught this the little fruit on it brother John I don't know if you ever you're not old enough but men Terence in different ones we'd have fights with them because you're throwing at each other and it hit it and it popped because it opened up that's why they called them and they blame it so brother Brown knows this he calls them creepers for if you didn't get those Creepers out where the corn was in the row like this then the creeper would reach over grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself around gradually what are you saying by the way remember what we were trying to get into last night there's a seed that comes up it germinates comes up out of the ground and then it gets choked out because you stopped walking you don't get these Creepers out I like what it's called creepers who wants a creep in their life no grab a hold of that coin and wrap it around gradually so easy so sly that you'd hardly tell it was wrapped and finally it gets stronger and stronger and it pulls that corn till it's deformed listen to what he's talking about pulls it against itself wraps it around its own Vine deforming form it from what it was now remember it was corn it's still corn but it's now deformed corn from what it was to something else yet it's corn but it's deformed corn and we are look and we are still in the image of God but some are so deformed as sons of God that ought to hit you right between us mine did me when I read that he's talking about sons of God he's not talking about somebody off the street drunk he's talking about sons of God sons of God get caught in that look that walk contrary to his word and to the way that he had us and provided for us to walk what's the plan just letting something the world twist us out of the way pull us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God now that ought to make you sh shiver in your liver that we were talking about last night shivering your liver because you know what that talk about Sons and Daughters of God me and you we can get to life choked out of us if we don't go up this statue of perfect man you can be a stumped Christian who wants that just getting a plan folks it's just so simple to get in the plan do the what the word of God says that's what we've been trying brother Dale's been trying Bob brother Louise brother Aaron myself we've been trying to tell you what the word of God says if you don't do it it's your fault all right you've never heard a preacher stand behind this Pulpit say now I know the Bible says but you really don't have to do that right right never have you heard that so whose fault is it if you interpret that in your little brain yeah creepers creepers creep in and take that good looking big old corn plant pull that thing over and be totally deformed right but yet still be a son and daughter of God wow you're quiet all right let's go Temperance Temperance now look how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken let's continue through that let's go to patience we before we gotta get through here in just a second in the New Testament remember the word the word patience is not in the Old Testament the literal word patience starts in the New Testament all right so the Bible says in your patience possess ye your souls all right join the new test it The Testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose what gets in the plan of God which never swears it's never pulled down by a creeper you allow he pulled down by a creeper I allowed to be pulled down by a creeper amen what is a creeper your own ideas and my own ideas contrary to the word of God and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest love trials and sufferings patiently and steadfast steadfast waiting for remember Simeon was 80 something years old it's not recorded where God spoke to him but the Lord spoke to him and said you'll not die till you see the Lord's Christ you'll not die when are we going to realize that that God spoke to us will not die till the Dead come out of the ground they have to be destroyed in a group of people Hebrews 6 verse 10 said for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister now continue listen and we desire that every one of you to show the same what Dylan Assurance of Hope what unto the end yes now remember what brother Mills always preached the seven civil programs it was the end of all things it's not the end like things are going to be done away with you can't end God but you can end an Administration you can end a testament we're going to read it tonight or this afternoon when we take communion it what Testament was done away with and the New Testament came into place the Old Testament was bulls and goats the New Testament was the blood of a man blood of God all right so we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that you be not slothful come on why don't we come to church to sleep I've never come to church and I know it's hard sometimes but I'm gonna tell you one more time you you have never fell asleep at a doctor's office he might have put you to sleep maybe that's what I'm doing praise the Lord anyhow to me this is life to me this is this should supercharge instead of instead of we're just listening and a lot of you that y'all that's all you're doing you just listen you just come to listen and you don't do a lot of that but ye be not slothful you ever seen somebody that I just um Daddy and Terence were talking one time and and this guy I we've got some and you've got some we all know some you know as britches there's three sizes too big his shoes are 12 sizes too big he's just Nothing fits everything's just slouchy and sloppy and they walk like this got hair all the way down to hair that's lawful and they were discussing somebody the other day you know years and years ago and and um on the testimonies that we should be doing the greatest testimony is that that I had a father that wasn't that image I had a father that was that image he was that image he was upright he was a Christian or not he was a better man than most men just by being who they are instead of being slothful so if he would have been that way though poor cancer looked just like he'd look like Ted Nugent back in the 70s praise the Lord if you don't know who that is Google it Luis will tell you maybe in a couple of weeks he's still alive y'all know that his hair's short he's a deer hunter that's why I know him uncle Ted but that's how we grew up we grew up dressing good being clean going to church on Sunday not being slothful not having to get my daddy up I know uh friends of ours we'd have to go to their house and get their daddy out of the bed because he's drunk never had to do that do that and I know if some of you did you rise up above that but what I'm saying is be not slothful the Bible tells us not to be slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he lifted his hand and he said I'll do it I'll do it uh Adam I I wanted you to do it you can't do it I wanted you to can't do it I'll do it I'll bring this thing to pass in other words I'll make this plan so perfect you can't get out of it it's going to perfect the people we'll talk about that last night tonight how are we going to have white robes how are we going to get blameless how are we going to get perfect there's therefore now no some of you are condemned now because of what I've said because you ain't living the right life but there's therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk get mad yeah Paul was the one that wrote it because you know what he was looking at what was going on in the church Romans Corinthians Philippians they were all churches and people in the church and that's what he was addressing but you know what that same Spirit didn't die it just came over here into the second Church age Third Church Age 4 5 6 7. all right James 1 verse 2 says my brother encountered all joy Joy when you fall into many Temptations Joy hey knowing this that's a trying of your faith worketh patience but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing we got to start realizing the Bible's already got all the words we need it's got everything in there exactly the way it's placed and not changeable it is unchanging this Bible is unchanging When It Was Written 1500 years ago in in print form it hasn't changed one word I want to put my faith in that not into shifting Sands of man's ideas he said now you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in US work work work work work work work work work and why don't you get work on the new birth first get born again get born again then you can start working on these other things right seek ye first to what kingdom of God and then all these other things things will come to pass we find those things happening now there's the trouble you know it I know it now brother Brown where is it there's the trouble we want to do what we think that we can work our way into heaven we think we can tithe our way into heaven no tithing is just you get a blessing if you tithe all right so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in US now there's the trouble we find these things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians piled up along the road is because they didn't go into it right in other words they didn't go by the plan of God and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many would like to be that raise your hand say Amen you know why you know why somebody didn't raise your hand because you're scared of it right you're scared of it you better not be you're right but you're scared to be the dwelling place of the Living God don't be scared if you're scared that means the devil's there and then the Bible says flee from him resist him and flee from him and say Lord come on in the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his long-suffering that long word long-suffering right here is bare long have patience not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance we read that not too long ago that's what God wanted he wants everybody to repent Greek Lexicon says bear long suffer long to be long-suffering that's what long suffering means patiently endure we're going to look at that word endure in this a little bit to be of a long Spirit not to lose heart two person patiently and bravely in enduring what what Misfortune in trouble yeah that's your two friends if you're a human to be patient and look now can you do this to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others remember brother Brown said one time he said if I was God I tell you one time if you didn't believe it gone but God's long-suffering 120 years he listened he waited for a seven billion people to receive Noah's message and knew when he started he was only going to get eight children of Israel 2 million come out he knew by the time they got in the original would be too yet he yet he he he babyed him the whole way same way with me and you to be patient and bearing the offenses of injuries of others to be mild and slow to punishment James 5 verse 7 says be patient therefore brother unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband and husbandman which is the bridegroom waited for the precious fruit of the earth now who's the precious fruit of the Earth we're it that's us we are the precious fruit of the earth he's not worried about apples and oranges and pears he's worried about me and you yes and have the long patience for it until receive the early and later ain't be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord drawth now more now than then says fourthly add patience to your faith if you got faith it works patience the Bible said so this is patience now that's the next thing on building this stature God's got real material in his building and how short we are brother and sister see why we're our where we're at see why where we're at yes sir we have Glory shouts because we got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all other things these other things we fall slide off we can't build his church he can't build his church the prophet of God sees virtue must be in us until we get virtue I've read this many times Maria because sometimes it stumps you say why faith is just it faith is all I got to have no it's not Paul says I can have all faith know all Mysteries yet have not charity I am a sounding brass and a tinkling simple symbol then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith but faith alone won't do it I'll shout out 1960 brother Brown said then Abraham we find out didn't obey God just right he didn't Abraham said get up and leave he got left but he took a lot with him he wasn't told to do that see but now in Abraham's heart he's like well this is the thing I ought to do no it wasn't the thing he ought to do it was Authority inside the whole town now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still not obey let me read that one more time I put in big letters for all those who said now he made ready and faith in the promise this is Abraham and then not obey still it'll hinder us wow I believe in the Holy Spirit I believe I should be baptized with the Holy Spirit now no matter how much you believe you've got to obey that Commission just faith alone won't work because faithful that works is dead that's right just like the borderline Believers got people today you find in the Bible said for it's impossible for those which are enlightened and may protect us of the Holy Ghost to fall away to renew themselves and get into repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and count the blood of the Covenant when he was Sanctified another holy Unholy thing and done despite to the works of Grace and Hebrews 10 it says it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God and those people you've seen them come to church what was talking about this last night they'll come and they'll say oh yes I believe yeah I got you brother Dale I'm with you I'm with you by the way I'm with y'all I'm with you I'm with you I'm with him wait a minute I'm with you I'm with you now I'm with you but they believe but they'll never actually we become hindrances you ain't man if you want to I'll amen because we because we I said we we become hindrances you're gonna blame it on God thank you you're gonna blame it on the devil well maybe a little but let's blame it on herself like Caleb and Joshua came back with the evidence they'd been over in the promised land now those other believers he shouldn't mean unbelievers they said oh it's great but we can't do it but they hung along just the same remember those 10 spies that said we can't make it and then the two that said we could Joshua and Caleb they didn't they didn't separate Joshua and Caleb stayed right there with him for 40 years stayed with them and they walked like this and was right there at the promised land and they just kept walking like this but look they never got to enter the promised land except for those two just those who come back with faith that we could and then he talks about the amorites and all that well now God just didn't go over there and take a broom and sweep out Canaan and all the amorites hit dots and all them and sweep them out say come on in Israel this is yours we've even planted Crocs for you no sir they had to fight for every inch of ground in other words they had to fight their way in they had to fight their way to stay there but they had the promise of Victory how many we got to we've got to have that promise of victory if you're so beat down try please try to say I have the victory somewhere it might be a little one battle ain't gonna be one in one day a war look Footprints means possession every time the souls of your feet touch that's it take that much ground in other words a little bit a little bit more a little bit more let's do this and then we'll close brother mom said patience with heart what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with who not your neighbor not your brother not your pastor not your friend patience with God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience you said well I asked him last night and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience in other words what are you working on that's what we were talking about last night somebody asked a question what's the difference in Divine Healing and the difference in a miracle a Divine Healing takes patience a miracle is something that a capture falls off or like the picture that's just free to send us to one picture this lady just eat up with cancer black spots all over him she was prayed for next time she went to have her X-ray done nothing there all right but now Divine Healing takes a while it tries your faith well I ain't no bet have patience what if Noah 10 years into his tenure as the pastor of whatever City he was in they tell him every day Nola they no rain and they're Whiting remember the Bible says the ground it come up from the ground the mess came up in other words the the aqueducts and the viaducts was pushing water up out of the ground there wasn't any reason for rain so he was preaching something totally totally away from science and totally away from anybody's perspective I promise you before Noah started preaching and during the time he started preaching nobody sold an umbrella right brother Carly umbrellas got created After the flood because they didn't need them before so that made it even more like I'm telling you today and some of you look at me cross-eyed somebody is not going to die somebody's going to need that umbrella somebody 's here before all that Eno didn't need one he walked was gone and he was not that's right because God took him but Noah had patience if he didn't come today it'll come tomorrow what if 10 years into this brother Dale would have said well I deal with these bunch of rebels no more where would we have been that would have been 1981. some of y'all wasn't even born what if he said fully I'm done with it close Church get out of here finish don't want no more of this bunch of rebels no he persevered he had patience knowing that what God would end his promise the end of the promise is is us going in the Rapture all right come on musicians why God said so and brother Louise was preaching several Wednesdays ago Wendy tell you that Noah Revelation that's a little over 100 years old and we want fresh Revelation every day we want something to we want something to spark listen we need to hang on to what God's already got it for us what God's already give us we need to hang on to it we find God come this far waiting for the church too but it'll be there don't you worry he promised it let's stand to our feet they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint Teach Me Lord Teach Me Lord to wait trouble over there is where people were in too much of a hurry it's just got to be done right now can't come back no more say and when you get that in your mind you're going to lose right there when you get that in your mind you're going to lose right there you're on losing ground right there you have nothing to stand on you must be patient they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength that's what I said God's in no hurry he let the Hebrew children get so close until they had to start feeling the heat because it killed the people that was beside of them that's how hot it was but you know what their testimony was we're not bowing to what you told us about too Satan we're not doing what you told us that we're supposed to do or or the government's got for us or this got for us and that's got for us we're not doing that we're going to die well if I die I'm gonna die happy I'm gonna die in the Lord but guess what happened it burned everybody else up but them it singed the ropes off of their hand s and when they come out and they didn't smell like they was even in a fire God didn't just keep them from the fire you talk about a body change how many of you have had Burns they hurt and blisters I've seen people burn all over their body and it's hideous it was seven times hotter they was walking in and the thing was glowing if you'd have just touched the outside of the Furnace you'd have died but they walked in it they walked in there we got trials and tribulations folks but we never had a trial like that before hey man we never were told that if you don't do what I tell you to do you're going into that fire pit but they did but they what they had Faith under the blood of bulls and ghosts they had that much faith because they come to a conclusion I'm not going to do I'm not going to bow we got to come to a conclusion today we're not going to bow to what the devil's got amen I'm not you should not bow we don't have to bow there's only one person we bow to and you know what he don't make us he don't make us but he loves it when we do when we Bow Down and Worship Him see don't be in a hurry wait and watch listen take the scriptures examine it see if it's right and if it's right hold on to it if it's not tell me so I can get it right that's what the prophet of God said right one more time be patient now we got that way we got to add it but if you ain't got it that way don't add it it won't work in other words we were talking about last night you know God shut the ark no it didn't Noah was still at the 120th day wanting a a crowd of people to just rush into the ark that's how much he believed of what he was preaching but God said I've had enough I'm going to close the door nobody else is getting in and then brother Brown tells us there's time when a gentile's door will close and I'm not going to close it and you're not going to close it God's going to close it and who's out there is out there and who's inside is inside that's what we're coming to it's not now I don't believe I believe we still got people coming in we're still preaching the gospel as if that is but there's going to come a time and a place with us that and listen that's our mandate in this Administration tells us there's going to be a day when the door is going to be closed and we can't open it for nothing nothing we can do but God said look God said it's going to rain and it rained and those who found a way of Escape took it those who didn't perished the same God that said it will rain set fire is going to fall from Heaven and destroy the world and there's a way prepared for you those who will take it will escape it those who do not will perish The Sinner will perish with a sinful world but the redeemed will be Redeemed by the Holy Spirit let's sing a song something for you to think about God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord I appreciate you oh heavenly father I appreciate you I love you adore you I bow down before you Heavenly Father [Music] Holy Spirit [Music] to me thank you Lord Holy Spirit [Applause] you [Music] you've got me and you're dwelling inside me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me sing it to him oh Heavenly Father talk to him he
