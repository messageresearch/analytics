fighting a cold me in June our and just forgive us if we we may just croak through this one I just don't want to croak croak through this number we will honk croak but if you got your Bibles we're gonna start now as we promised winds denied we're gonna start with the fifth seal so if you will want to read revelation 6 start with verse 9 yeah and we're gonna kind of go back and review a little bit since it's been a little while since we put everything up here so we'll review a moment if that's alright at least try to get you for you go to the Land of Nod hello hello we're gonna try with one trial got it thank you brother Danny what happened over here oh man there we go now save that thanks sir all right revelation six start with the ninth verse by a few announcements Bell Joe green it's going to be here with us this Wednesday like brother Dale said gonna take a few days and go hunting with him and Nathaniel Bible studies this coming Saturday also December the 16th you heard from Regina what you need to do now so y'all kill the fatted calf and y'all go get the vegetables so we'll see how that works we just we so blessed without with food too it's just unreal and that'll be on December the 16th brother Chris long will be with us obviously for the what's not service so just keep those things in mind and there's any other announcements just look on the website because Joe puts them on the website for you so we don't have to make so many announcements revelation 6 verse 9 play for brother Bob he's there with their parents or her parents I think down in Mobile I think brother William was preaching today I think so or be with him on the travels back so we all had a good time Thanksgiving and all of our travels were obviously safe we all got back and and thank God for a little bit of time we did have to just take off so revelation 6 verse 9 let's bow our heads the Lord Jesus thank you for this day thank you for another opportunity Lord to speak to the ones that you've chosen to be in this hour being this time and more than that to be in this building so that we can all talk about you while the we pray that you'd be with the ones that are not Willis ones that are sick ones that are sin sick Lord we think of many that have fallen away and left and back slid all kind of things Lord we pray that we with this fifth seal coming up Lord we we're gonna see an abundance of grace the Lord that abundance of grace has been extended to all of us all through our life this by the grace of God that we stand here today all of us thinking back right now through all of our lives each individual of the times that maybe something could have happened that we would not have made it this far in life but Lord for some divine opportunity we are here and I say it is a divine opportunity because you knew who was going to be here before the foundation of the world you knew who would and who wouldn't but Lord we pray today that we would all just draw a little bit closer to you realize that as I've always said before man is no way in our humanity that we come up with the word called grace it's only by you Lord that has created this grace to give to a group of people that doesn't deserve it if father we pray that you'd just be with the ones on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for the labor forgive us of our sins and our daily mistakes Lord lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit be the active participant in this service Jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the fifth seal you don't have to just bear with me I saw under the altar the souls of them were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true that thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated in the Lord at its blessing to the reading of the word so now as we look at the fifth seal we want to just kind of lap back over and for the sake of my voice and to think of all of us here let's go back to where we were several weeks ago and just make sure that we got this together because we got that we've got the church ages one through seven right one through seven and this is the Gentile dispensation right all right this is Gentiles now we can go all the way back into Daniels seventy weeks and look at the chart that brother Branham drew and we can see that we as the wild olive branch was inserted in that timeline of the seventy weeks of Daniel look at your chart it's 69 weeks over here there are 70 weeks determined for the Jews to bring them in like to bring them into the to get rich for the tribulation for the key Battle of Armageddon got it sixty-nine and one well there's an insertion in there and that's the wild olive branch that God has grafted in you and I were grafted in there here's your grafting it's mmm I was telling them in the sentence go class downstairs when we look at Romans we see Romans is talking Paul is talking about a group of people that didn't have the law a group of people that were not righteous people didn't even have a promise the Jews had a promise the whole Old Testament is their promise they had the Torah they've got all the Old Testament prophets but God every time when Jesus was on the earth every time he talked to a Jew a juice I'd you touched me Lord come and see my child come coming to this coming to that but a Gentile a Gentile heathen that had no promise I had no promise of anything he said I perceive you're a man of authority and where you go where I tell people to go they go he said in other words when he was saying Jesus he said I see you have power that you don't have to lay hands on me you just speak the word and my servant will be healed if it was a Jew they'd be good come Oh Lord's got to go over here and we got to do the tour and we got to do the sprinkling and we know that was that was promised to the Jews that wasn't promised to the Gentiles and then what did Jesus say even to the South Phoenicians woman and the Centurion he said I have found no greater faith so see all of you and I listen a Jew what did they do when Jesus was there when Jesus was there they the first thing they said was we be of Abraham they had a lineage they had a promise to go back to they had a temple look to the temple because the Bible told him that's what happened to Jonah remember Jonah Jonah looked toward the temple if you get in trouble look towards the temple that's in the word right look toward the temple or do this or do that that was do's and don'ts it was works things they did because it was promised to the Jews for that to happen but when he come up and saw the Gentiles that just said we believe what you said he said I found no good or faith so what you and I we have to have faith for something we don't see Jews needed to see something but when the very were in Romans or we in Romans 9 9 and 10 read 9 and 10 he talks about the stumbling stone that's the problem there stone was standing in front of them and they stumbled all over him that's why it's called his dumpling stone he came and he was a rock of offense why they took offense to everything he said you a man making yourself God right so that was the stumbling that's why they stumbled at the very you know he they told him they said we have Moses and I told them it's like I've always said you know we got 1,100 sermons well they walked up to Jesus and they said we got Moses this quote book it's called the Torah we got Moses quote book we got brother Browns quote book didn't do them any good no they didn't know the God that was in that quote book because jesus said if you would have known Abraham if you would have known Moses you would have known me so we have to know something by revelation that we've never seen before we have no promise now sure you say well we don't know in the Old Testament we had no promise Jesus came and brought that promise the promise of the Holy Ghost that's our promise it's to receive the Holy Ghost that's what happened on the day of Pentecost I brought bill Adel was talking about you forming ladder rain what Jesus preached fell on them on the day of Pentecost it had rained on him for three and a half years and then the harvest came there was 120 plants there was 120 plants in the upper room they they were watered for three and a half years but then that last little gusher came from heaven as the sound of a rushing mighty wind and that started your church ages alright then he's got to go back you said what's this got to do the fifth seal you got to remember we're gone so this is this is to the Jews and this is actually this the fifth seal is in another dimension the first four seals worth we've been talking about is that happens in this dementia fifth seal actually happens in another dimension alright so then that what God's got to come back we've got to leave get caught up for him to come back and fulfill that last week to the Jews there all right well that okay to do what to do six things which is the six fold purpose that six fold purpose brings them back just like the sixth eels are bringing me in you to a change of the body it they're obviously gonna take a body change because they're all gonna die and they're gonna be caught up in other words they're gonna be pulled into another dimension okay that all right so now we've got our seven Church ages everybody got that same am alright now the first three ages type the first seal right we'll put this button like seal number one excuse me this one will be number two now remember you got lap over all right three then you lap over and this one will be for cuz they all lap over but to show the first three ages the first seal second seal third seal for sealed now the first seal was what the first seal was a white righteous church or a white horse rider right a wild horse rider rode out in the first three ages so what combated it was a white righteous church that had no denomination no denomination no false doctrine oh yeah that was some it was trying to get in there was there was certain was like Sorrenti us and some of those that were that were bringing in doctrines but you didn't have an established denomination they were beginning but it wasn't established cuz remember because it's the saying a deed and a doctrine it became a saying became a deed and a doctrine in this long church age right here which was that middle one in Columbus time when the Catholic Church took over right right and then so this is white red black and pale we all remember that mmm alright so we got that and this is the dispensation of the Gentile age because remember on the fourth seal we take a rapture on the fourth seal we're caught up so the Gentile age is over on the fourth seal we are living under the anointing of that right now in the fourth seal death and hell will be destroyed because death in hell is what wrote in that Pale Horse death and hell wrote in is alright cuz they come in and see how Satan does he mimics God and he can't come up with anything original bless his heart don't bless his heart he come in as a white righteous church if he would have come in blasting and screaming and and you know you understand what I'm saying people would have said hope wait a minute but he come in with flattery he come with with simplicity and just a well like Sorrenti us you know a serene theist said well now was was Jesus God no I think he was a light substance of God because he couldn't be God because he was a man in him you see all the reasoning that comes into all that well you know what I read yesterday and Iranians run out of the bathhouse that he was in and said I ain't gonna be caught in the same room with that guy another word none I don't want to be in there with that heresy and that heretic idea but you know what that idea didn't die it just kept growing all the others kept growing because right in here see in this right here that's where the denominations were established okay coming out of the cat the Catholics come in and then after the Catholic come in here comes the protesting or the Protestant we've already been through this but just for just the background to get to the fifth seal because the fifth seal is over here the fifth seal is when we're gone but it's in another dimension so we got to talk about this first then we'll get to that but then you've got you read which was white killing 68 million people got killed in this Dark Age Christians so that was a lot a lot of killing okay all right and then he comes out and you say well what you think black would be over here no the black this blackness is the worst blackness this is the time when man comes in and starts making denominations that are totally against God's Word and that remember the scripture we read if if what if your light be darkness how great is that darkness you think you're walking in light but you're totally walking in darkness that's worse than just being in darkness at all and then so that black horse rode in set up denominations and you know what God winked at that because he's got brighten every one of these look they sprite and every one of these ages born-again true believers my brother Nels talking about today Paul comes in starts his reign then he has a harvest without his harvest that's thing about this morning listen to me you'll get something this Paul's harvest was the harvest of souls right Irene is his harvest was the harvest of souls obviously because they're dead in their body their bodies gone but now when we come to here that's why there had to be an eighth manifestation just like what we're talking about somebody this morning when brother Branham comes and sews the form of rain the latter rain is the harvest rain and it's the last one sure he harvested souls no doubt but you can't just keep harvesting Souls and people's keep dying you had to be in the eighth manifestation of God over here at the end of the age right here in this little part when the son of man is to be revealed that there's a body change got to happen so it's not just your soul that he's harvesting and it's brother branham's not doing the harvesting you understand when we put names in here that's God Paul gave nobody the Holy Ghost when he was here Irene escaped nobody the Holy Ghost but you know what he done he directed them to so that God could talk to them under the auspice of that age and the box of that age and they accepted it when they did that put him in the body thereby all right with that put him in the body and then that was the harvest or the latter reign of Paul's teaching Irina's all the way up to even Pentecost and then even brother Branham lapped back over into Pentecost they're starting in 47 to bring a message up to 63 he was established in the faith of the fathers bringing us back to what where they were right here bringing us back to the faith of the fathers here's the faith of the fathers right here those three ages is the faith of fathers right that's funny but see God had to bring us back to that he had to restore the three because he's not going to harvest a stump stump is not going in the rapture know what brother Branham oh he the Cedars on there with the shucks he said the seed is at the end of the memory all your seed is that was at the end of the vine or at the end of wheat goes out and then it matures here's your original seed an apple goes out you got apples hanging at the end of a branch same way with you and I see that's what it is that's what we've come to we've come to that we come back to the fruit again we've come back to where what it'll reproduce itself so in reproducing itself then it's going to come right here and we're going to be caught up so what the harvest of the of the seals that we're about to talk about or that we've been talking about the harvest of the seals is your whole body spare and salt done all right the whole thing whole thing's got to go this time because we'll read a little bit later on we'll read what brother Brown said about not today but we'll read what he said about the souls and so sleeping and all that stuff like that we'll talk about that a little while but not not this survey so everybody okay with that we got church ages we got Gentile churches Satan rides to white horse red horse black horse pale horse this is where we're living in now in the seventh church age right so we're in this and it white red and black together makes pale then we showed that this was more just justification sanctification the whole ego and I'm gonna put right here word made flesh that all right because the culmination of all this is the Word made flesh okay so we type justification white now look everybody okay I'm all right don't worry about me don't worry about me I'll be fine I might have to eat a eat one of these but that's okay I really don't care we're gonna get it done faster sign you don't sign language will get sign language on what stuff you can interpret it Spanish yeah but just now look we went through justification in baby form which chopped off your past sin right sanctification which what drives you unclean spirit out the Holy Ghost is when God comes in burns your old nature out and God Himself the Creator comes in the man that made everything the not a second person or third person but the person of God divides his soul out into you not like that and then you truly do become the Word made flesh but you're a baby you started the baby desire the sincere milk of the word but when we go in talking about these seals is what we've been talking about I hope you could see that that when we went through the force for seals that this is a higher form of justification this is a justification where brother branham covers it I can't remember where he covered it we'll pick it up I'm just going to kind of give you an overview and then we'll come back and read it where this justification is as if you've never done it so this would be as if you come to a revelation that you were trapped into the first part but when you receive the Holy Ghost you come back and I we've talked many times before that you go right on back through justification again when you get into the pyramid so we come to sanctification what is sanctification clean and set aside for service what the brother branham's when he saw the vision of sister Shepherd what happened there was water bringing trash out trash now you're already born again but there's got to be a sanctifying process in this statue of a perfect man that burns out the air that gets all the trash out amen so statue a perfect man Colette's to me that's the sanctifying process you already got the baptism the Holy Ghost in the baby form your baby right down here and you born babe in Christ then you grow you realize this as you've ever done it and then you realize every Sunday and every wings you and every time you match play and every time you meditate that God is cleaning up you don't just automatically these are just lines of reference okay folks these are just lines of reference because God don't just pour virtue in you and it fills that whole line up I wished it was that way right since about I wished it was that way I really wished it was that way I know I know but it's not it's not that way let me do some housecleaning here it's not that way it's just those lines can be just like England if it's your life like my life these lines are going like this on the inside you get a little bit of godliness and then you get a little bit of this and then you get a little bit laughs but you sell them in though you know when you got verse you you know when the knowledge the temperance the patience the godliness there's there's no you're not standing there and God's filled up this much of you and then he filled this much and then he fills up this much no it's a daily walk with God it's a daily realization I mean how many of you have come from a place that when you were born again who was that me and Joe so much things remember what we were just telling man Joseph said brother Joseph Canada resting right back there he's 45 42 he told me a few minutes ago he said you know what he said when I was younger things bothered me he said now that I'm 40-something years old he said they don't bother me as much as they used to I see you where do you get 58 and 60 and 70 and 80 those things are become very frivolous they become nothing right well that's the way it is with God you say well no that's not yeah it is that's the way you grow you grow up in the things that you used to do you don't do them no more but the things that used to bother you sure they come to you but they don't bother you as much and then but remember God is not a granddaddy because when we become grandparents we let everything go if a grandkid does it it's cute that's just the way it is right Josh just get some mad at me he said daddy you to never let me do that when I was younger what if I'd have done that I said you would have not lived to have that green car Renshaw but because she does it it's wonderful she just took a pen one day and got my hunting magazines and she just I mean she went but about three she just drew tore pages throat stuff everywhere in my hunting magazines and you don't do that much but she did and it was cute so I didn't mind it but Josh tried to kill him so God's not a grande to let you get by with everything but he is a father that wants you to grow up and then you go huh that used to bother you sighing they don't bother you anymore does it right same way with God if you can't see if you can't see how God deals with you by the way you by the way you are you ain't got the whole ego you ain't got the Holy Ghost if you can't see how God how you deal in your natural life and how that God lays right over the top of that and deals with you basically the same way cuz we're all we're all different you know what some of y'all wouldn't even have a hunting magazine in your house so you can't relate to what I'm saying but maybe Good Housekeeping maybe Popular Mechanics maybe some other magazine but it's the same principle the kid tearing the thing up same way with God basically he deals with all of us the same way because it's in his word because that's the way we live and that's the way he deals with us by the way we live I just believe that that way it becomes more personal to me it becomes person that I know God's dealing with me okay alright so we see justification as if you never done it sanctification in the statute of a perfect man cleaning the trash out red what red is always sanctifying Red's keeping us clean member brother Brown said you're not saved by the blood you're kept save your kept saved by the blood you can't get unsaved but you can get kept saved by the blood throwing all that trash out all right say man now we're talking about the Holy Ghost here but let's put all another one in here y'all can't see in the back that says adoption because you come here and you're getting up this statue of a perfect man to where God can use you and then remember the Prophet said he seals all that in he seals it in with what the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost that you got when you as a baby but now you've come to more maturity he's been able to to offer you things and you treat him right he didn't offer you the car keys at the bottom of the pyramid amen but now once you get older he'll hand you the keys to whatever vehicle you that he has for you to use that all right that's just pretty simple that's what makes the seal so simple to me it's just the onion peel you just keep peeling it back now we come right here to where we've come here to where these a few things got to happen remember I gave you the four things death is destroyed death was not destroyed right here except in your soul got it that's not destroyed in your body and your spirit right here but what about praise God that you come up here to adoption and where does adoption work through I believe it works through the spirit realm your memory reason conscience affection imagination cast down those things get rid of them get the knowledge of God the temperance of God the patience of God the godliness of God brotherly kindness of God all right you didn't have that when you were here potential you received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy cry father Abba Father but when you come around here you gotta quit cryin if you're still crying you're still right here we got to start believing what God's already done for us not what he's going to do what he's already done for us he's equipped you for your whole sea this is yeah I hope you hope you get this before I pass out this right here is your whole journey as a Christian right there that's your whole journey everything you do say breathe talk listen here memorize everything is right here in these in this four seals because it's in this dimension it happens right here everybody got that it happens right here cuz look even your body change is in this right here it can't come any other way they can't help you they can't help you they can't help you they can't help you they can't help you they can't help you and 99% of them can't help you they're already gone they're going on they can't help you they're in another dimension waiting on you to bring them to this dimension amen they're in another dimension they've already went they went through whatever stages in all this they went through but they have never went through this stage yet the body's changing death destroyed that's why you and I wife spent so much time on that force field because we must realize that the resurrection and the body change lies in you and I the voice of the resurrection will come through the bride of Jesus Christ and you know what you know what this proves I already told you this two or three thousand times this proves right here that we don't go through the tribulation because the Tribulation Period is right here you and I take a rapture bodycheck talk about a change and a resurrection it all happens right here we don't go through the tribulation period if your bride I don't care if you pass away today and you're just right here as a newborn babe in Christ you will never die never can die never will die your flesh will stop producing and they'll put you in the grave the firing mechanism has left the electricity has left the building so that's what you are your soul is your electricity you know that's what we are right that's why they see them we have x-rays x-rays proves there's something in there besides you it shows bone and all that other stuff but there's a reflection somewhere coming off of that there's a firing mechanism what makes my end do that now if my theophany was not in me it would be and that'd be it it would never move again right so it's the fired mechanism your soul is your firing mechanism that's what keeps your heart pumping hello but that fire mechanism of those just passed on is over in another dimension and they're waiting to come back here and get back in that same body so just start working again but it won't be like this that's beginning to happen to me don't worry after about 15,000 pieces of mail a week that old hand right there kind of goes my dexterity has left the building but you know what they're over there on the other side brother Robert Tatum he's not over there with his hand all turned over to the side like this no he's got 20 year old hands and he's over there talking to Gary Adkins and all the ones that have went on that we know we know because they're here you know we're sitting here brother mr. Marlow all the ones lord of mercy charlotte gives me gave me a reminder not too long ago every time I put on a tie I think of Richard that man could put together I can't do stripes in circles and Prince Richard could do stripes and circles and prints and Reds and dark green and blacks and purple and he put them all together you go wow that looks good if I put him on you go who did that was the room dark when you put that out right Charlotte so she gives me this big box with like 150 times the guests so every time I get in that Thai box and you give me this one but I was trying to pick out some more but you know what there's our connection they walked among us they're part of us they're more part of us now because they had a human life they they they work through now they're all together in one place and they're all going come on people come on people hurry up because remember we're gonna get into where they're saying how long how long but not this fifth seal people listen up we got to separate that that all right we got to separate that because this right here is bride bride material and this is the bride of Jesus Christ now none of this is on either side Israel's not nothing is not his bride remember he divorced her in the Old Testament can't be that no more their servants they're gonna be giving the whole ego but they're not getting this cuz you know what we have to have faith for every bit of this you know what why did brother Branham what what if he was an impostor what if they broke these books and we don't know where in the world this come from but you know why I know it's right because what's inside of me rings out with what's on this page that firing mechanism that I got that God recharged about twenty years ago took the old one out and put the new one in it agrees with this so I know it happened how you know Jesus walked the face of the earth how do you know that you never seen him ain't no picture that's the closest one but God give us a prophet to say hey that looked like him so at least we kind of narrowed it down did he give us the Prophet to say Eve was blunt headed and blue-eyed no it's not what he said that's what he saw and then he told us I told him this morning I said anything I don't care what the Prophet said anything you can't put faith in and put it in the word is hearsay right it's hearsay that's what the that's what the Pharisees and Sadducees couldn't get over it was all hearsay to them but the one that said it was standing in front of them that's what's gonna happen today the one that said it has got to be here the one that said it has got to be in control then we know it's right then we don't have to pick quotes to fight quote we know we had to speak to the Prophet I believed William Brennan was a prophet I believe he told us the absolute truth but if we can't if the one inside of me can't agree with it it's hearsay the only thing you've got is a revelation a revelation is not hearsay when brother Brad went across the curtain of time before he went across the curtain of time it was hearsay wasn't it what have you always heard of your life boy you know Uncle Joe he's walking with Jesus on the streets to go nice a lot when I was what we heard in there right mama sitting at the feet of Jesus right now that's all we heard walking the streets to go right well that's always a lie according to brother Branham and I believe he saw it he didn't get it wasn't hearsay God sent him over there to come back and tell us he's sent him to the promised land he sent us to the promised land by a prophet with a vision and I don't believe too much about a vision I believe he went there that fired mechanism went over there and because they hugged him that's why we're gonna see in this fifth seal if we would have just paid attention to the Bible the Bible said down in another dimension they cried with a loud voice they weren't over there like brother Ram thought you know many times he talked you know brother Nevel just floating on a cloud remember we all were going to play harps and float on a cloud right that was hearsay it's not hearsay anymore we have proof what the problem is is 210 line preachers that went over into the promised land remember I preached that sermon but what about 15 years ago I still have people when I go to root they go I enjoyed them by a priest on 10 line preachers because there was 12 people went across the promised land they're also same thing they brought back evidence and 10 of them said we can't take it they God that's our problem The Lying preachers in this message have kept us here there was only 2 that believed and God had to wait till all them other preachers is dead for them too amen to take them across in the promised land that all right death has got to be destroyed that's a reality that's not hearsay you hear me I don't mind people saying brother Brown sin that's fine but I'm like brother Clark why singer says why do we have to get up and read 45 quotes why can't we just preach it out of the revelation of our own faith adding those in because 90% of the time we're quoting either brother Branham of the Bible why do I have to say 1950s 65 while we are not a denomination nothing why do I have to read that why for weak people for weak people trying to convince some of certain things no you can't convince somebody this it's got to be a personal revelation with God because as hearsay hearsay will hold up in court but an eyewitness will show up in court and say I saw well I'm gonna tell you today I saw these seals open I see them open and I see what it's doing to a group of people it's not hearsay death is destroyed by our belief not in a Torah not in all this other stuff but what Jesus did what he sent that little prophet to break this thing down to us cuz you got to remember - now I not belittling brother branham at all none you hear me he preached the seals seven nights I was looking in the I was looking in the things over there he never mentions the fifth seal except in the fifth seal and a few times before never mentions it again in the message now the sixth seal he mentioned it because it does a lot with the Tribulation Period he never mentions hardly mentions the seals after he preaches them hardly ever mentions Daniel 7 two weeks after he preaches them why because once it's preached once it's open it's for me and you to take it's for me and you to break it down to other people break it down to each other break it down like this and have 15 sermons on the fourth seal brother Ram said I can't do that I don't have time but was it gift to us or did he put it in his in a little book and carry back with him no he opened it and it stayed open and it's still open and it's not hearsay does you know what if you shut the book it's hearsay because I can't read it but if I can read it in the book that's not hearsay that's something I can see so there's your four seals hey all right now look I'm gonna make this statement and I'm gonna then I'm gonna write the fifth seal down we're gonna talk about just for a few minutes cuz I wanted to get this out of the way now the first four seals is the in actuality what happens because we leave right here and we're not seeing anymore until it's kind of strange that we go up in revelations chapter what kind of strange would go up Revelation chapter 4 we will go up on the fourth seat that strange that a coin sir I don't think so but we go up in Revelations for one and um we're not say until 1924 so revelations four we're caught up and then then it then God starts dealing with the Jews but we have to get the spiritual part of it so the four seals that we've been talking about if we take a rapture then that's been destroyed all these things that we've been talking about so this is actual belief what happens and it shows you what happened but now you say well once we got five six and seven let's just throw them away and give them to the Jews we got to have all of them I mean I'll bring you a quote next Sunday brother Graham says six seals finishes Redemption so we got to come too right here under here so we got lap this back over this way hey all right with that we got a we'll have it back over and go five six seven because we got to have them all this and the Seventh Seal what brother Graham said Seventh Seal brings Christ back to the earth they okay five six and seven it's too legit enough five is in another dimension sixth seal comes back into this dimension during the Tribulation Period so we know we're not here all right in the seventh seal the seventh trumpet is the same as the seventh seal kingdom of our Lord has been come to king of what Christ comes in fights for the Jews everything's done and over with and then we go into the Millennium still under this because it's Christ in us going on into the Millennium thereby alright with that alright so we got a little out this back over now and start talking about the fifth seal there by alright you see that so we got to look at this one through four tells us what happened five six and seven is going to show you exactly how it happened everybody all right with that five six and seven is going to show you and I how this one two three four happens because the fifth seal is a great seal why would 5 be the number of grace not a coincidence again and what does this 5th seal do it's not as if you never did it it's the real you never did it never did it because without that and without this and without this you're not gonna take a buddy Jenny but you do take it here that's why it's kind of confusing to be careful but you got to take five six and seven and lap them back here because look we're gone right here all seals are broke to the Gentiles to the Gentiles while we're still here because there's no one else saved after here this is Gentile they mean nothing to these any none of these seals mean anything to these people that go through the tribulation only that we made it and they may have a chance from knowing us because the foolish virgin doesn't get any of this sure they get sanctified but they get baby sanctification right is that okay they're not confusing you they get me they're not saying to fight up here they're sanctified right here they never come to that faith to receive the Holy Ghost if they receive the Holy Ghost then that puts them in our group and they're not foolish virgins but remember they're virgins to the Word of God they have cleaned their self up but they never went on to the Holy Ghost you know why a lot of times that happened I'm gonna just tell you this there's gonna be a lot of foolish virgins in this message because the preachers that preach and got to holy go and if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you can't go no higher in your pastor they'll tell you it's this they'll tell you it speaking in tongues bleed brother Brown was a prophet that's gonna be the worst one listen those people didn't only believe Moses was a prophet they knew he was because they had his Torah right there in their hand God told them to do the temple things of the temple and the very temple was standing there and they missed him same thing now same thing now God has sent this listen I told you the other day the son of man revelation will also bring the the son of man three-and-a-half-year revelation go back to Matthew Mark Luke and John and read it look what the highest form of religious world did to Jesus and that's what they're gonna do to anybody that is the Son of Man the bride what so what's the highest religious form in the old world what we say randomized randomized they know everything they know it all they know everything it is they all they know it all well I don't want to know it all I just want to know him all if I know him all I don't have to be a know-it-all you want to put that down and hope that you can that's not copyrighted you can come if you want you write it down man that's okay you write that down interpret that in Spanish but you know we always lay heavy on the Son of Man we know that the Son of Man anointing is here but that same anointing that combated him was here too we don't we don't talk about that sometime but that same anointing that caused the son of man to come on the scene and do what he did is all around him who was it the religious world who's gonna come down on us the Baptist Methodist no no no it'll be the people in our own right Judas was in Jesus's range wouldn't had part of the ministry one of them 10 line preacher but the fifth seal that we're fixing to talk about I'm gonna read you a few quotes and we'll be finished we're gonna have to see that this grace we look at the fifth seal and we're gonna break it down later then it is souls under the altar cry how long how long then we know how that who that is that's the Jews under Eichmann and Hitler but there's a lot of things that goes with that but when we see that it's growing out what happened what is the whole pretense of the fifth seal God gives eternal life to a group of people that doesn't want it didn't that mean you mean you I mean did you just grow up one day and say I want eternal life no God had to come to you hey boy that's far enough your mind your mind hey let me get your attention and that's what he done around here and then now we've come to a place that we look and see right here because remember he didn't have to deal with the real you never done it his real you never don't need to start with but we're born in sin we're saving an iniquity we'd come under a little bit different part right but he still had to deal with memory reason conscious defense and imagination because remember the Bible said that when he was out in the wilderness the devil came to him and tempted him he has been tempted by the devil in his mind the whole time he was alive he was not exempt from that but you what he done he done what we don't do he right but he does he never dwelt on any of that now that's the son of man so that's what you and I gotta come to the prince of this world has come and has nothing in me now you say well now now in a way well now in a way that's the devil if you're gone in a way that's the devil you're either God Almighty in human flesh are you the devil almighty in human flesh that was quiet right there's no gray area then when you get into this you get born again then God starts working as if you never done it you come to a place that not only God destroyed your past but he's destroying every day that you do something that you asked forgiveness for keeping you clean by the blood at sanctification that statue of a perfect man is burning all that out then you come to adoption it won't be a bunch of babies that's the body change can't happen can't happen cannot happen all right so let's read this here just for a second well reads what brother brings in so we got the fifth seal six himself said we got a laughing back under here so that we get all this so that gives all seven seals to you and means that all right well that'd be okay with that then we come to this grace that we were a group of people that didn't want it because look this words gonna get sticky God blinded the eyes of that group of people right here let's look right here look the fifth seal Jew he literally blinded their eyes and said you can't see Who I am you know why he blinded their eyes for me and you so that this could happen I feel good now but that's what he gave us he literally blinded because you know what they would have accepted him he came that he came the exact way that the Old Testament said he would come Jesus said what part of this do you not understand I've done everything that the Bible told he said but you can't see me but I'm gonna give you eternal life for something I did cuz he's got he can do that I'm gonna give him eternal they don't even what's the same thing what happened to us when we were born in seeing shaping the neck we come to this world speaking lies what happened hello we were blinded to the things of God then all of a sudden one day he goes hey it's me hola and now we come though when we get all these things right in the order we must because we'll never take a body change if we don't no no not here say that the real you never did it this is not the real you so what's inside never done it never done it never sinned a day in his life because God had to literally blind them but you know what God had to do to he'd put his out hand over his own eyes cuz if he sees sin he must destroy it so he covered his own eyes for two thousand years so that means you can come in what kind of grace is that now I'm telling us what I said there's no way man could come up with that word no way you and I are too judgmental oh well I am and y'all are not then well thank God we're not God yeah that's right under that yes but we're judgmental in our humanity everybody raise your hand everybody raise your hand that's how many people are judgmental right but what is grapes do oh yeah if you're not under this you're judged but God can't judge you right here and you received the Holy Ghost he can't judge that fired mechanism because it's him he can't judge himself he's already been judged and it wasn't his soul that was judged he gave his soul ransom he gave his body a sacrifice he gave us all a ransom so what he can ransom you that's why I'm telling you you never lose them that's why I said people go with one of the seals the cells have got to be the plan of redemption everything we talked about is the redemption of man all the way to every cell all this is Redemption we wouldn't need this if we were dead in trespasses and sin but we need this but once we come to realization if you don't realize the real you never done it you'll be so condemned you can't take a body change but the only body changes gonna be to buy this bottle that man standing right there the seventh seal is the man let me read a few things and it will quit hey okay - excuse me just a minute I'm gonna hide but you still heard what I said anyway sorry maybe if I sweat a little more I'll get this out of me all right fifty let's read the quote number one don't keep that in your mind in your heart we're gonna come back to justification again you're justified complete the real you never did it so we comin right back we keepin our continuity justification all the way I didn't erupt it on there justified justified you did not do it in the first place justify that's not talking about that justification let's talk about that one all right quote number one this is watch brother branham now we're gonna talk just a minute we're gonna read some quotes what he says about the fifth seal stomach step over here all right Oh Lamb of God come forward now this is his prayer right before he brings the seal we call on you Lord the great Redeemer come forth and show us your plan of redemption so the fifth seal has a part of our planet for do its part of my plan of redemption we just proved that we brought it back over here under the because somebody did ask me the question well what about the fifth sixth and seventh seal right here we're going right back again we're gonna laugh right back over and bring it around here all right show us your plan of redemption that's been hid through the years breaking this fifth seal for us tonight Father and revealing what's beneath that seal for us now the fifth seal for the Jews for that Jew that's over there in another dimension B said break it for us that we might go away a better Christians than we are now might be better fit for the task that lays the head we ask in Jesus name all rights go to number 2 this is paragraph 25 I just brought a few quotes right at first excuse me daddy quit doing that you're making me do it well now I get started on them subjects and we just talk on he was telling my stuff now people around the wall are standing in the halls rooms so forth right there any all they're gonna see it when you preach them Jeannie or your mom and Daddy anymore it just clearly y'all weren't there okay I know brother mocking him were there on the sixth seal right cuz they saying if I were you and make a change all right hey brother Joe's dad and brother Mike brother Ernest mote brother Robert ate them they were there singing if I were you I'd make the change so we have a connection with these people they were there during the time of the opening the seal now I want to give thanks to him who's I'm the present look and that today not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning just about an hour before daybreak then when I was out praying so brother branham when he comes to that fifth seal he realizes he better put his notes to the side all seal 1 through 4 he said I looked on my whole notes and I was gonna preach this I looked on my old notes and I was gonna preach this I looked on my old notes he said buddy came a holy hole totally different way okay I'm just telling you what he said not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in a same material mysterious way this morning hour before daybreak all right school number three number three now this is rather a mysterious and now for the sake of tapes and clergymen and teachers descending present that's us now if you have a different view of this I did too but I'm just taking it from the inspiration which completely changed my view of it see and we'll read what he said what he thought it was and then I find out as you see these revealed it's taking right back and bringing those Church ages see look so this has got to happen to us in the church ages to us all right and the scripture right together tying it up and that's the reason I believe that it comes from God he depended a lot on him Church ages Denny number four this is paragraph 69 notice there's no mention of another beast or a living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal now remember that was on the fourth seal that was on the first seal second seal third seal fourth seal but none here now we've been through some of these but I just brought them to bring them back to your attention now this is a pretty long reading but there's only two quotes left and we'll be done we've been a little bit about an hour all right number five fifth seal now notice I love this at the time of the writers of the four horses the rider I'm gonna let him explain what I just explained kind of of the four different horses there was a beast that announced the power every time the rider straddled another horse and came forth to ride another kind of beast came out and announced it that's a great mystery what you talking about the line ox man and eagle the holy ghost in the church age is working through the people not all right that's a great mystery see that is the mystery why announcing the mystery why isn't there one here on the fifth seal to announce it here it is according to the revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me today see our this morning early that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time let's scroll it up the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took his last ride and we found him on the pale horse mixed with many colors and rods all the way into British perdition we get it on the trumpets and so forth when we teach that getting plumb off the subject and we go he rides that's the reason there's no one there now we know written because some reasons for something we know written cuz some reasons for something now you remember at the first beginning I said there can't be nothing without a reason remember the little drop of ain't that you've got to find the reason there was a reason they didn't have to have a beast or a power to announce this still being broke and only God can reveal why that's all because it all lays in him in other words nobody else's revelation had ever been right just what he just said nobody else's revelations been right but he's fixing to tell you but the reason that he reveals that I as I understand that is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church ages at all how about the fifth seal that's right there away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up at the fourth chapter revelation does not return until it comes back with its King in the nineteenth chapter but but cuz you know what the seals are in Chapter what six and eight revelations tens in there in between all that right so we just need to kick it all out erase it out of your Bible cuz it's not to us I don't think so the only way we get to revelations 19 is what's in between revelations five is what there's your grace there's your Redemption chapter revelation five right the church absolutely wait a minute yeah the church absolutely is raptured I miss something what'd I miss we're my Oh for chapter right thank you Joe thank you does not return until it comes back with its king in a nineteen chapter but these cells here are revealing what has been what is and what will be now he covered every bit of it right there see and now what was to be for the church age was revealed by these seals not just four of them all of them and now watch what takes place the four stages of his rider has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist riding has been revealed at this time because remember look when the Antichrist when we go of the Antichrist comes down and heat he continues on look over here he continues on he's he's revealed through he's exposed through us we go up he comes down and he becomes he becomes Satan incarnate in that Pope while not while we're here while we're going right the four stages of the Antichrist writing has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have they don't have to have anymore there's no more beast left and there was four living creatures of God to announce the ride rider as they rode for beef our four powers all right let's read this last one number six this just kind of sets the stage for for next week now notice and they're not verse souls under the altar now here's where I'm going to get some real disagreement but just watch for a minute I thought that too but it didn't come that way we've I've always thought that those souls under the altar where the the martyrs of the early church and everybody else did to see how wrong that would be because you take seal number five and you put it right here you don't have no martyrs of the early church they've already raptured there's nothing in this dimension that we're talking about that that our born-again Christians but you're a Smith taught it a little bit different and he always thought that these are the souls of the altar where the the martyrs of the early church and I'm sure that dr. your eyes Smith and every one of them says it is see but I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't it wasn't the souls now now you say well I don't know about that well now just a minute we'll find out scroll it up so everybody can read it please these are not the souls of the bride Church not at all we thought that was the bride Church waiting their souls under the altar you see crying how long how long Lord let me read it again so get it right when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held keep that scrolled up please see the Word of God and the testimony which they held now don't move from there just a minute see and they cried how long Lord how long you stay holy and true dust out judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and the brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being open the church is gone it just can't be the souls of the early church now now please if you ever did give this attention now because this is great controversy so I want you to listen real close now and you've got your papers and things to write with now I want you to notice now these cannot be themselves because the souls of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in the rapture and the fourth chapter revelations they were taken up so brother Brent was getting ready and so am i and the next Sunday we will jump into this position that we're talking about here this seal this fifth seal is not ever don't ever get it in your mind that it's the bride no Christian it's not somebody not even a foolish virgin it's a special group of people that's going to be given grace like you have never seen it before and if you'll read the fifth seal I I'll I've got it marked in my seal book but I left it at home I circled every time brother Brown said grace in the fifth seal unbelievable unbelievable why because it's a great seal it's the seal of grave well now that seal the grace can't do you any good over here right what's great is gonna do you any good and glory you don't need it you need it here you need it so you can get caught up you're gonna get caught up in grace why remember in what is it where's ekor ayah we said the headstone will come crying what grace grace unto it not just grace double grace we need double grace you need grace for the inside guy you need gracefully outside yeah we need all kind of grace but that grace right there n-type is gonna be what we need but now in action about it's gonna be grace to a group of people that never even heard of Jesus Christ never knew he was the messiah just like me and you you didn't care when yous young don't tell me now some of you may have been born again when you were younger I wasn't some of you weren't it didn't bother me you know why because God wasn't in there but when he come knocking on the door it was great graves Amazing Grace let's stand musicians coming let's sing amazing grace I won't be able to but choke in Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found I try to think about John Newton as he's carrying those slaves across America into America you know they say that's where he got the inspiration he was just a dirty old man I mean he was not a Christian at all until he saw the he saw those slaves and they were not even singing Amazing Grace they were seeing something that had that rhythm to it one of their old songs i'll get the history they just need to if you ever get the DVD it's called Amazing Grace and its really good its way how John Newton comes from the Lord it starts right but can you imagine him standing looking down at those slaves with angry eyes maybe not allow compassion but then one day God came and saved that man's soul and he said I once was them I once was those people down in the bottom of Lex yep I was bound I was a slave and I was not going to a good place I was going to hell and then God took me out of that slave pit and he gave me grace Amazing Grace Oh zing brain how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me [Music] was long say it to him bye don't say you take neighbor don't sing it to me close your eyes and singing to him was blind [Music] [Music] my heart toothy hi grace [Music] think about it I may need a think about you lights dirt all over talking about earlier tonight I [Music] car oh please that has more me safe thus far hi great well [Music] [Applause] Oh same time now Oh turn it down right knee [Music] gods bring flavors let's praise him now just for men all praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God [Music] amen the anthing of the believer it was Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me you know we're getting this fifth seal we're gonna sing just over an abundance of grace the brother Larry that's what's got us here right now it's grace grace has brought us to this hour it was grace in Paul's day to accept Paul's message and to live the life of Jesus Christ same way with now we accept the message that brother Branham Brahe we live that message but somewhere in that message has got to bring us a body change like no one else that's why I say go to the Son of Man the Son of Man G only one who took a body change so he's got to show up to get us out of here you know what nice can I say this that's more grace than it was on the day of Pentecost can you realize that you saw no well yeah that's where it started but he got into the soul of man these people right here this people now not only God gets in the soul of man but he works through the spirit realm and then we are not a second person we're that same man that stood on the shores of Galilee in another form called the bride now he said that I did so he said that so that's what we need to do because if we're not the Word made flesh sure we can be the Word made flesh and still die and go by the grave Jesus was he was the Word made flesh but he died once for all I heard so somebody's gonna realize that we ain't gotta do it again to me that's graves brother Lewis to me and us grace we could be out doing a million other things right now listening to a million other things doing a million other things but we're right here not just in this church but we're under the Dome of the of the revelation of the end time in the end time we have come under this revelation and it's grace and we need grace for everyday right grace for every need grace for everything we have need of so god bless you just keep us all in your prayers will be back wings and our brother Joel be speaking for us but all minds clear let's just sing amazing grace one more time [Music] the Grace how sweet the sound they say RH [Music] your God we pray Lord that our little buddy Lord as we feel his body Lord with a little bit of heat to it that you'll break that thing father and she'll drive that thing away from him Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Amazing Grace how sweet docile [Music] Dok to be placed on a true believer in you lord now I praise the Lord when this cloth is laid on my brother Lord - whatever is binding his body or whatever needed he has Lord that it would be loosed and there'll be a report Lord and a testimony in the name of Jesus Christ amen King grace how sweet [Music] okay [Music] bless his little piece on his neck Gordon it'll not become a rash but it'll be here with you guys thinking the other day you know you talked about grace [Music] there was a healing angel up there in Northeast Georgia Medical Center right now healing not because they're Christian there's a healing angel you people we gotta believe in this there's a healing angel that's in that hospital right now that's healing those people and they don't even care who is some of them were not even Christian duty know probably cursed in the name of God yet he's healing that's great that's great two human beings not just Christians that already but more Grace on Christian but to heal somebody don't even want to be healed [Music] the Lord we pray Lord with a childlike faith of our little sister Lord but you'll take away that is in front and it won't bother anymore in the name of Jesus Christ amen believe amen but I don't think about it God gives grace to people don't even want it so what a great mystery in the fifth seal the God gives grace to a group of people that didn't want him he does it every day it's kind of normal to him to send the healing angel up the hospital or to somebody's house and they don't even know who he is but yet he's gonna heal him why because he give him a human body and that human bodies got problems and he lines that human body back up through the help of doctors in medicine so how much more us as Christians should see the grace of God in our life yes ma'am mr. pran should have been released prior to COPD and scho okay okay good you got whoever this prayer call clothes those worn we pray that it will accomplish what it set out by the desire of our sisters heart whatever it is worn may it be accomplished in Jesus name Amen what the contacted god bless you y'all brother Dale was telling you the other day we we have a friend of ours

what Center a special angel one that will protect your Lord in the time of trouble Lord you even when you were here in human flesh you've had angels come and minister to your father now I pray Lord

nighttime when it becomes so rough Lord Lord I pray that you'll be with her Lord and bless her in keeping keep her safe Lord keep her mind clear lock Lord so that she can hear from you father and not the lies of the devil father just bless her now and take care of her in Jesus name Amen why can't we pray for an angel pray for an angel Jesus needed angels when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane an angel came and ministered to him what an angel was given to the Lord Jesus brother Ram says you have an angel that stays with you your whole life mine's in bad shape but he'll be all right my guardian angels I had to go through the light same way with you guys but remember one thing's for sure God will never lie and Satan will always lie even though Satan tells you the truth he's a liar and he can do nothing unless you allow him to do nothing he has no power unless you give him that power resist the devil and he'll flee from you our problem is as we go No resist him and he'll flee from he didn't say it walk away he said flee from Cleveland the Bible tells us that that Satan come to Jesus take him on the mountain take him on take him nothing he he was pretty comfortable brother a because he took Jesus Christ himself on the temple so Satan was pretty he was pretty confident that he could go to the temple and nobody recognized who he was do you understand what I'm saying but remember Satan had to leave him when God the last third time he said it is written it is written and if you'll read one I believe it's the Book of Luke the last one he says it is said because being written can be hearsay but when it's said by revelation it becomes reality all right let's bow our heads your heavenly Father thank you for this day lord thank you for a time that we have with the people of God or there wouldn't be no other place I'd rather be than here father greatest you'd bind us together Lord with grace and love and revelation more than anything that would draw closer to you father forgive us of our sins are many mistakes that we make our thoughts that are contrary to you Lord and the ones Lord there our families that are sentencing lord I pray that you knock on their door Lord knock on the door of their heart Lord give them a chance to come in father we pray that you'd be with us down we go our separate ways it wasn't some of the highways we have many miles to travel between us all to bring us back together winters day night Lord and service for you father grant these things in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed [Music] you
