John first chapter verse 12 and it reads like this so but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name they were gonna read one who acts the first chapter in a verse for a separate versus but yeah shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and injured in all Judea and in Samaria and unto unto the end unto the uttermost part of their one more scripture Hebrews the fourth chapter and I want to reread a verse from there I actually prefer first one and two out there and it says right here Hebrews the fourth chapter verse 1 and 2 it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of Internet to his rest and uh and it is really any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them them not being mixed with faith in them days early that's thought I'd trust God that you would take these few words and give us a sprint Lord and speak to your peoples one more time father God hasn't give me on my script of this service but it's so spirit use it for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God just this evening I looked at description here it says the Word of God not being mixed with faith probably there nothing he'll do that was driving I was looking at that they heard it but it didn't do him no good honey in other words him hey do you go to church you hid a word but it would win you win you you and you can heard over and over I wanted to move I don't want to take I want to see the word what power behind it and it was so we begin to look at him my title would I had looked out of the bread a list and pinnacles the power behind Pentecost and I looked at it I thought about Pentagon I said what was the power if you think about Peter what power came with pinnacle and I thought about that slave when the word upended even a damn pinnacle never had to be like mixing heard a one heard all the Jesus preaching they heard Jesus preached and they knew two things here buddy he still was not what he want to be never run they were hiding in the upper room because there was a friend and a public it had to be sublimates and on the day of pinnacle he'll come to power God came down and took it mixed the word and faith together and then they start preaching the gospel how lose that when the Gusman came real to him how do we know her in the world so pinnacle had power to mix the word and faith and I thought about that I say you know mission is a when Jesus was healed in the Old Testament it makes he took me he told him they kill a lamb and eat it so what you know each they take those lamb in I want you to eat the whole lamb I want you to eat everything with the lamb how do did he says but he put something else in it he they but would you put a little bit of bit of herbs in it and to really put that enough for the experience honey sober you'll have a testimony behind it honey you got an express behind it honey they eat the lamb so you go through your trial you can look back say God brought me from there okay I will do this I regard was living in I will do I know I was the one in pain but I know that my god in the hill I don't remember that I got a little bit of hurt and he loved us a little bit he makes this messenger in the word we had to eat a lamb we had to eat the lamb to eat the whole book and I'll tell you what it means that it will be better he put a little bit of business in there so when we go to our trials and tribulations we can look back and hurt with an experience like this is what God done for me I'll I bleed the word and the word stuff still for me and it was Jesus even told at one time except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you you're gonna have to mix me Halloween we still doing it in same body type communion site we still mix it I lose if you don't mix it how do you gonna have some bit of trials if you don't take it you will help the trial if you take it outward so you know what do you two need to go back and get on your knees and make it right if we gain ticket so begin to look at me think about them Baines here and I were so I'm think I gotta get a chance more departing or going supporter that do get rid support doing it but let us say here bad guy brace you know he give us all you know we talk about wraps in faith this is I'm gonna don't want to say a few things before I can survive we talk about wrap your fate you say I wanna I'm gonna uh I'm gonna I'm gonna have a wrap here I'm gonna wrap some faith in a way and then we come to the time and a trial at something cut my way and we forget about it we you know we see like you see like every commandment well who got you what are you God is letting something take place God only give you a chance a trial so you can get a gain a testimony how do you know where he give you something because Joe couldn't never a preach on the resurrection until he had a trial until he had a test and with Joe got a test here and we're doing tribulation Hollywood a joke do he saw some that no other prophet so he saw Jesus coming out a grave in the resurrection he know he was automated it was through trial to gave him the great blessing and there were so you know and so we all need to have it but I like your it make us either when the Holy Ghost come up on it make a witnesses we become we got we begin to become a wind we we got a testimony i Lou you're done let me look at here on here let him pull up something real real quick in Hebrews 11 first five here Hebrews 11 verse side we can pull up enough every day and I want you yeah we look at inna Jesse wake up with a chest he didn't wake up Holly you know just said I believe the message hello he he would put skin on the message how they insane time for the message to help skin on it so by in the words oh hey Weiser well I got famous he did not only did he have faith he had to mix that thing here to make it come real to him and the Bible says hell that's by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him and him for before his translation he had here the testimony hardly any testimony and he had a testimony that he pleased God hallelujah the word it was something way with him he does it have a still or stillbirth he had a birth with life-image he had a testimony with life in it how do I know that my God is real how do I want to testify how do we say it so somebody ought to testify your devil don't want nobody to testify by the way oh you like you to do this well how's it well how you feel today yes I'm gonna die I guess you wield oh I guess you will if you're gonna tell like but that's just money like you I don't want to say nothing I don't want to get nobody to think of somebody how do you know the devil don't want you to say none and he tell you that because he know your testimony might like somebody else life somebody out might hear your testimony and you might be the one that called that person who receives of them God does what anyone hurt he's you know and the Bible says we overcome him by the word of our testimony hi the replica revelation teaches of that and by the blood of the Lamb so we got something to testify so now get back a few months ago I went through a great great setback it started in March you know started February and it started with just something that brother like I said it just hits you at once all at once my throat starts to closing up on me and I realized something's going wrong in my body for the first time I never had this happen and all of a sudden I've eaten my food and all my food was stop right here and went go down then I would put a throw it up for 10 days and I knew something was wrong I said something wrong I said my food and now I'm losing weight and stuff like this and I'm just throwing it right back so I say tell my wife I said I need to see a doctor and I go to one doctor they look at me they do bloodwork they send me back home and I can do blood work or they wouldn't tell me what's wrong I'm I'll give you free blood I ain't paying for your cattle at here was tell me something I'm gonna be giving out my blood I mean I'm never gonna pay for God and everything but in a way didn't kill me then it sent me back home and told me to go take some something over the counter like in house and man

remember I was that young guy he probably should have you would know that I was a young guy that got kicked out of school when I was in the ninth grade I got kicked completely out of the Gaston County school system but why she went to school with me she okayed that even though she was in love with me she didn't know it at the time but she didn't know it at the time but she was in love with me so

is wrong and right I had to do it for myself oh god no what you're doing with a man somebody you don't even say you never enjoyed probably God dude hit let me ask you a quick question now each other that means you agree to quit why you think that John the Baptist was in the wilderness John the Baptist should not have been in the wilderness learning learning how to be a brother under John the Baptist what a priest sir he should have been a priest Zachariah was a daddy hello Jones you knew how'd it go in there like the canvas knew how to do the showbread John was a pre I born in the priests house but God in our danger to be a priest he ordained John to be a prophet so he need John in the wilderness not in a not in the tabernacle so what'd he do they killed Zachariah when they killed Sagar I'll just run to the witness when you come out he was a prophet he's Godhead training got a guy got a reason he got a way to do it we don't understand if God got stuff for you to do you might run but you can't get away from you can't get away from my god I had to play and I thank God for His grace I thank God that he's already healed me I might not feel the full result yep I ain't got nothing to do with feeling he's already done done the job he'll lose already just started working on me hello you know you you don't something you had no sell out you old times probably testify you don't sing yourself beat down so for that you feel like that the last breath and all of a sudden on their last breath that come the Holy Spirit and you back it sure honey ensure that God either with you yet Oh God got a plan for the church and I thank God with my wife she stuck with me in about a bed and everything when I was really weak and stuff she say that we would try to get me to eat I
