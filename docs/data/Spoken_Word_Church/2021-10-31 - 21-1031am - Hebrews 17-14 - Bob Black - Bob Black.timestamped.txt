[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] god bless you saints we got a little
[0:02] small crowd this morning

[0:06] we're two and three together together
[0:12] we sure been getting a blessing out of
[0:14] listening to the to the camp and uh i'm
[0:17] so proud of all the the kids getting up
[0:19] and singing we were watching the
[0:21] specials and everything
[0:23] it's uh it's it's good you know when
[0:25] they get to camp they can kind of
[0:27] they make their own decision i guess you
[0:28] know that's good that when when they
[0:30] don't have mom and daddy there to prod
[0:32] them they're doing they're doing it
[0:33] they're they want to do something for
[0:35] the lord and that's good
[0:36] that's good to see
[0:38] how many enjoy brother ryan's sunday
[0:39] school lesson last sunday appreciate it
[0:41] appreciate
[0:42] that
[0:44] if you didn't listen to that i encourage
[0:46] you to go back and listen i sure enjoy
[0:47] that story about the uh don't forget the
[0:49] main thing
[0:51] um and the other things he shared
[0:54] let's go into we're just i think we're
[0:56] about done with hebrews chapter one um
[0:59] we're just taking our time with if the
[1:01] brothers can pull that up and uh
[1:04] and we're um
[1:05] just kind of going going through at a
[1:08] at maybe a slow pace but just so some
[1:10] things settle in
[1:13] so verse seven is where we uh or well
[1:16] actually we we ended up at verse 13 but
[1:18] let's just kind of read a background
[1:20] we'll just briefly background some
[1:21] things this morning to kind of set some
[1:23] context again
[1:25] before we keep going
[1:27] and verse 7 says and of the angels he
[1:29] saith who maketh his angels spirits and
[1:30] as ministers of flame of fire
[1:33] but under the sun he saith thy throne o
[1:35] god is forever and ever a scepter of
[1:37] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[1:38] kingdom
[1:39] thou has loved righteousness and hated
[1:41] iniquity therefore god even thy god hath
[1:43] anointed thee with all of gladness above
[1:46] thy fellows and thou lord in the
[1:48] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[1:50] earth and the heavens are the works of
[1:51] thine hands
[1:52] they shall perish but thou remain us
[1:56] and they all shall wax old as doth a
[1:58] garment
[1:59] and as a vester shalt thou fold them up
[2:01] and they shall be changed but thou
[2:04] art the same and thy year shall not fail
[2:07] but to which of the angels said he at
[2:09] any time sit on my right hand until i
[2:11] make thine enemies that footstool
[2:14] so last time we kind of dwelled on this
[2:16] a little bit if you go to the next slide
[2:17] and we begin to kind of meditate on how
[2:19] god has set himself down somewhere and
[2:22] we began to ask the question where did
[2:23] we see it
[2:25] and uh you know
[2:28] i'm kind of trying to follow a thread of
[2:30] the thought through this and
[2:32] putting
[2:33] because you know you can you can be in
[2:34] it begin to think um you know that uh a
[2:37] lot of times our mind will begin to go
[2:38] that god is somewhere far off on on like
[2:41] the other side of the galaxy or
[2:42] somewhere far off unreachable but the
[2:44] bible says he's not he the word is
[2:46] nighty even in thy mouth he'll be with
[2:48] you he's with you and he'll never leave
[2:50] you forsake you and those kind of things
[2:52] so so the thought is that he's actually
[2:54] he sat down in your heart and if you go
[2:57] to the next the next uh slide that he's
[3:00] in the old testament the type was that
[3:01] there was a mercy there was a seat for
[3:03] him to sit and he sat down between the
[3:05] cherubims and in type showing that one
[3:07] day he would set down in your heart in
[3:09] the middle of your three-room house and
[3:12] the bible says in psalm 99 1 the lord
[3:14] reigneth let the people tremble he
[3:16] sitteth between the cherubims let the
[3:18] earth be moved
[3:20] it's really important to kind of set
[3:21] this framework down so that when you
[3:23] begin to all the scripture ties together
[3:25] so beautifully and you begin to get over
[3:27] in revelation and it talks about one
[3:29] sitting on the throne and those kind of
[3:30] things and it's helpful to be able to
[3:32] you got to have the picture set so that
[3:34] you can so that you don't have the cloud
[3:36] uh the clouds on the ground and the cow
[3:38] up in the sky and everything and it
[3:40] creates a great big beautiful beautiful
[3:42] picture so when you get over in
[3:43] revelations you can read it the right
[3:46] way of what it's really saying
[3:48] so when and when brother brown went on
[3:50] the next slide when he preached
[3:51] revelation chapter 4
[3:53] he said now the mercy seat now the mercy
[3:55] seats in the heart seek where the
[3:57] shining forth of his glory and all of
[3:58] his children the shekinah glory and the
[4:01] human heart is that the mercy seat
[4:03] and then in in yale a highlight he said
[4:05] is god's presence and when a man walking
[4:08] or a woman he's reflecting the shekinah
[4:10] glory he don't go into gambling dens and
[4:12] carry on and go out here and deny the
[4:13] word
[4:14] no matter what the people says he's got
[4:16] his heart set on one thing
[4:18] god
[4:19] because god is set down on the mercy
[4:22] seat in his heart and in the next slide
[4:24] and that's why peter on the day of
[4:25] pentecost began to quote that the lord
[4:29] said thou almight he began to quote that
[4:30] scripture from psalms for david is not
[4:32] ascended into the heavens but he saith
[4:34] himself the lord said unto my lord
[4:36] sit thou on my right hand until i make
[4:38] thy foes thy footstool
[4:41] and then the next slide we talked about
[4:42] how that the enemy the last enemy to be
[4:45] to be defeated is death
[4:47] or in first corinthians chapter 15 says
[4:49] then cometh in when he shall have
[4:51] delivered up the kingdom to god even the
[4:53] father when he shall put down all reign
[4:55] and all authority and power for he must
[4:58] reign until he hath put all enemies
[4:59] under his feet the last enemy that shall
[5:02] be destroyed as death
[5:04] so now you got a picture of of christ
[5:06] he's now he died on the cross for us but
[5:09] he couldn't yet take his he couldn't yet
[5:11] to go and sit on his throne so he comes
[5:14] down and sits on the father's throne
[5:16] which is in your heart and he's doing
[5:18] the work of the high priest in the old
[5:20] testament the high priest would go
[5:21] beyond the veil and he'd put the blood
[5:23] on the altar and he would he would go in
[5:25] and do the work and then he would come
[5:26] out he'd come out and and everybody
[5:28] would you know everybody maybe would be
[5:30] breathlessly waiting for him to come out
[5:32] wondering if he was going to die i
[5:33] wonder if everything worked out all
[5:34] right and they'd have that tassel tied
[5:36] to him so that if he did die while he
[5:38] was doing the work he would they could
[5:40] drag him out
[5:41] that rope the rope tied to him and so
[5:44] he's doing the work of the high priest
[5:45] and all that speaking of something that
[5:47] christ is doing if you go to the next
[5:48] slide
[5:50] christ has been doing for the last 2000
[5:52] years
[5:54] now see this is why
[5:55] uh daniel's 70 weeks is so important so
[5:58] i just want to i'm just going to touch
[5:59] on this really quick because daniel 70
[6:01] weeks lays out the pattern
[6:04] a lot of times when you read scripture
[6:06] it's so important to see the pattern
[6:08] everything god does he's the same
[6:09] yesterday today and forever and he works
[6:11] in patterns if you can see the pattern
[6:13] that he works in then everything begins
[6:15] to start fitting together and the
[6:17] pattern here is that christ died on the
[6:19] cross he preached for three and a half
[6:20] years and then he sits he sits on your
[6:22] throne for two thousand years
[6:25] and then when he's done with the
[6:26] atonement the atonement process when
[6:28] he's done when he's finished
[6:30] he rises and is made he visibly comes
[6:33] and takes his throne again he's visible
[6:35] again so there's a pattern now now he
[6:39] uh god actually even repeated that
[6:41] pattern and the six-fold purpose a lot
[6:43] of people wonder you know i've talked to
[6:44] people what am i supposed to really be
[6:46] getting out of daniel 70 weeks we'll get
[6:48] that pattern
[6:49] and then then the pattern is repeated
[6:51] the pat the whole pattern that you can
[6:53] see as the seals are open and all the
[6:56] the the process of redemption that
[6:58] christ has brought us through then it
[7:00] repeats in the sixth full purpose
[7:03] six seals finishes redemption there's a
[7:05] six-fold purpose to to
[7:08] that god brings uh
[7:10] israel in the and and and works through
[7:12] that seven years to until he can finally
[7:14] come and take his throne again
[7:17] you know there's even a pattern in
[7:18] genesis where for six days got first he
[7:21] he spoke and there was light and then
[7:23] he's began to separate the atmosphere
[7:25] and then life began to come up from the
[7:27] ground and then he began to turn
[7:29] just like the seals he began to turn his
[7:31] attention to the to the heavens
[7:33] turn his attention to the sun and the
[7:35] moon
[7:36] you you can apparently see there's
[7:37] patterns things and then on the seventh
[7:39] day finally you got a masterpiece family
[7:41] again back in harmony walking in the
[7:43] garden and then when christ comes when
[7:45] he returns to sit on his throne you've
[7:47] got him coming back with his bride
[7:50] coming back in the millennium to rule
[7:51] and reign
[7:52] coming back in harmony
[7:54] so see i got down here at the bottom sit
[7:57] until
[7:58] see it he's sitting until the last enemy
[8:01] is defeated
[8:03] so let's go to the next slide
[8:06] and the fourth seal brother brown said
[8:07] and then we find out that in the
[8:08] revealing of the seals that the lamb had
[8:10] left his mediatorial work as an
[8:12] intercessor
[8:13] because he's he's done he's done the
[8:14] media tour he's he's he's done the work
[8:16] of the high priest and had come forth
[8:19] now to claim his rights all that he had
[8:21] redeemed by his death
[8:23] and then no one could open the book no
[8:24] one understood it it was a book of
[8:26] redemption and god the father spirit had
[8:29] it in his hand because christ was at the
[8:32] throne as a mediator the only mediator
[8:35] where's the throne at now we just laid
[8:37] that out the throne is at the throne of
[8:40] your heart doing the work that when you
[8:41] the work of a mediator when you might do
[8:43] something wrong then his blood is
[8:45] covering you he's on the throne of your
[8:46] heart that when you when you just do
[8:48] something wrong because he's on the
[8:50] throne you you want to repent you you go
[8:52] and you ask god forgive me
[8:54] because and he's there he's there to to
[8:57] do the work of a mediator
[8:59] you see that's one of the main topics of
[9:01] hebrews is that christ is our high
[9:03] priest
[9:04] he's he's our high priest and that's
[9:06] what paul as we go through hebrews he's
[9:08] bringing that out he's he's fulfilling
[9:11] what was typed in the old testament the
[9:12] work of a high priest he's he's the he's
[9:14] the high priest and he's sitting on the
[9:16] throne of our heart doing that part
[9:18] doing that work
[9:20] therefore there could be no saint no
[9:22] mary no joseph no nothing else on that
[9:24] altar because it was blood and only the
[9:27] blood of jesus could make the atonement
[9:30] and in the first seal brother brahm said
[9:32] and notice every time joseph left when
[9:34] joseph rose up
[9:36] from that right hand of that throne
[9:38] watch glory
[9:40] there set joseph by the right hand of
[9:42] pharaoh and when joseph raised up to
[9:44] leave that throne the trumpet sounded
[9:47] bow the knee everybody joseph is coming
[9:50] when that lamb leaves the throne yonder
[9:52] on his days of mediatorial work when he
[9:54] leaves the throne up there and takes
[9:56] that book of redemption and walks forth
[9:59] every knee will bow and every tongue
[10:01] confess
[10:02] there he is there he is visible now now
[10:06] see when you look at that chart of
[10:08] daniel 70 weeks and you see that pattern
[10:10] uh one thing i kind of want to bring out
[10:12] you can you look at that pattern of what
[10:14] how god is how the redemption plan
[10:17] and and you look and you study it and
[10:19] you see the pattern begin to unfold
[10:21] but then
[10:22] then slowly something begins to reveal
[10:25] to you god begins to speak to you of a
[10:27] work that god is doing in you
[10:30] so that's the really the main thing it's
[10:32] got to be personal we can look at we can
[10:34] look at the chart of daniel 70 weeks and
[10:36] weeks it's like it's like a history
[10:38] lesson you know things things happen in
[10:40] the first three ages and then the next
[10:42] age and then the next two ages and the
[10:44] next age and so on and so forth the
[10:46] souls under the altar and it looks like
[10:47] something that you just study out
[10:49] but what you got to be getting out of it
[10:51] is something that god's doing in you
[10:54] that's why when you when you it's so
[10:56] important to understand where the throne
[10:58] is because it's not just something to
[10:59] learn about something that we we
[11:01] just kind of have the mechanics about
[11:03] but to know that god is actually abiding
[11:05] in your heart that he's come down to sit
[11:07] in you that see then it becomes personal
[11:10] then it becomes god's doing something
[11:12] something real in your life
[11:15] and then and the soul's in prison now uh
[11:17] in on the next slide
[11:19] brother brown said uh that's a fantastic
[11:22] sermon if you want to dive into the
[11:23] seals too brother brown says things that
[11:25] in that sermon i don't know if he says
[11:27] anywhere else
[11:28] he said but under the sixth seal were
[11:30] these trumpets opened remember under
[11:31] there we find out that the lamb came
[11:33] forth appeared on the scene he appeared
[11:36] on the scene
[11:37] he had left the mercy seat his work of
[11:39] redemption was finished
[11:41] and he came forth and took the book out
[11:43] of the right hand of him that set up on
[11:45] the throne and time was no more
[11:47] and that next quote the revelation of
[11:49] jesus christ he said do you see it
[11:52] the lamb the high priest the high priest
[11:55] holding his blood as an atonement on the
[11:58] mercy seat for our sins
[12:00] is the lord god almighty
[12:02] that is his present office
[12:04] that is what he is doing now
[12:07] pleading his blood for our sins but one
[12:10] day that lamb will become the lion of
[12:12] the tribe of judah
[12:14] he will come forth in power and glory
[12:17] and take his authority to reign as king
[12:20] and when he's king he'll become visible
[12:22] again
[12:23] visible manifested in the flesh so that
[12:26] he can come and actually sit down on the
[12:28] throne a physical throne
[12:30] manifested physically so the next slide
[12:32] just to kind of sum up that again where
[12:35] where did he sit he sat on the throne
[12:37] he's sitting now on the throne of your
[12:39] heart and that's why paul in hebrews 1
[12:41] 13
[12:42] but to which of the angels he didn't say
[12:44] that to any angels he didn't say that
[12:46] any old testament prophets
[12:48] sit on my right hand until i make thine
[12:50] enemies that footstool to sit on the
[12:52] right hand of god and power and
[12:54] authority to sit down not on a thrown
[12:56] way out somewhere but on the throne of
[12:58] your heart not to just play games but in
[13:01] power and authority to actually overcome
[13:03] overcome all your stubbornness like
[13:05] brother brown was saying in that sermon
[13:06] that that was playing before to overcome
[13:08] all your stubbornness and pride and and
[13:10] overcome your desire for sin sitting
[13:12] down in power and authority on your
[13:14] throne until every enemy has ever come
[13:17] the overcoming he's overcoming uh
[13:20] pride and avarice and lust of the flesh
[13:23] and the pride of life until every enemy
[13:25] including death is overcome
[13:29] so let's go to the next slide and we're
[13:30] just going to read this real quick
[13:32] we're just going to touch on this real
[13:34] quick just to kind of lay a thought give
[13:36] you something to think about and
[13:37] meditate on and the first seal brother
[13:40] adam said
[13:41] the voice is a thunder
[13:43] the voice came
[13:45] from where
[13:46] from the throne where the lamb had just
[13:49] left as intercessor
[13:51] to where the voice come from
[13:54] now he's standing here to take his
[13:56] position and his claims
[13:58] but the thunder
[14:00] came from the inside of the throne
[14:03] thundered out
[14:05] and the lamb was standing out here
[14:08] the thunder
[14:09] where the lamb had left
[14:12] left the father's throne
[14:14] to go to take his own throne
[14:19] now he said now don't miss it friends
[14:23] i was listening i was mowing the yard
[14:25] and brother brown was preached i think
[14:26] it was the fourth seal where he spent
[14:27] like 15 minutes talking about y'all
[14:29] y'all ain't gonna see it
[14:32] but i think now we're at a time where we
[14:33] can see these things
[14:36] we all know as christians that god swore
[14:39] to david that he would raise up christ
[14:41] to sit on his throne
[14:43] to sit on his throne
[14:45] and give him an everlasting kingdom here
[14:47] on the earth he did it and jesus said he
[14:50] that overcomes the antichrist and all
[14:52] the things of the world shall sit with
[14:54] me on my throne
[14:55] as i have overcome and have set down on
[14:58] my father strong
[15:00] now someday he rises from the father's
[15:02] throne
[15:04] and goes to take his own throne
[15:07] now he comes forth to call his subjects
[15:10] how's he going to claim them he's
[15:12] already got the book of redemption in
[15:14] his hand
[15:15] now you see how it's got to be personal
[15:18] it's got to be when you when you read it
[15:20] like like that maybe
[15:22] you read it when it becomes personal
[15:24] you're reading it differently
[15:25] because something that is actually
[15:27] happening in your life
[15:29] now let's go to the next slide
[15:31] and we'll finish up we're going to
[15:33] finish up with hebrews chapter one which
[15:35] says which closes out which
[15:37] to which the angels said he at any time
[15:39] sit on my right hand until i make thine
[15:41] enemies that footstool are they not are
[15:43] they not all ministering spirits sent
[15:46] forth to minister for them who shall be
[15:48] heirs of celebration see then he brings
[15:50] it back personal
[15:52] the whole story is about god trying to
[15:54] redeem you he's doing something for you
[15:56] are they not all ministering spirits
[15:58] sent forth to minister for them who
[15:59] shall be heirs of salvation and you
[16:02] are the heirs of salvation
[16:04] so this story this story is about christ
[16:06] and his bride
[16:07] now let's go we got about about 10 more
[16:10] minutes let's start on hebrews chapter
[16:12] 2. and let's just read this and see what
[16:14] good things we can pull out of this
[16:16] chapter as we as we keep moving along
[16:20] hebrews chapter 2 says therefore we
[16:22] ought to give the more earnest heed to
[16:23] the things which we have heard
[16:25] isn't that the truth after we've heard
[16:27] all those things that paul laid out in
[16:28] hebrews chapter 1 all those good things
[16:30] about where christ sits and that he's
[16:33] greater than all the angels in the old
[16:35] testament and all those things about how
[16:37] he's a high priest and we're going to
[16:38] get into that more lest at any time we
[16:40] should let them slip
[16:42] for if the word spoken by angels was
[16:44] steadfast and every transgression and
[16:46] disobedience received a just recompense
[16:48] of reward how shall we escape if we
[16:50] neglect so great salvation which at the
[16:53] first began to be spoken by the lord and
[16:55] was confirmed to us by them that hurt
[16:57] him
[16:58] god also bearing them witness both with
[17:00] signs and wonders and with diverse
[17:02] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[17:04] according to his own will
[17:07] for unto the angels hath he not put in
[17:08] subjection the world to come wherever we
[17:10] speak
[17:11] but one in a certain place testifies
[17:13] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[17:15] of him
[17:16] or the son of man that thou visited him
[17:19] thou madest him a little lower than the
[17:21] angels thou crowned him with glory and
[17:23] honor and it's this set of set him over
[17:26] the works of our hands
[17:27] thou has put all things in subjection
[17:30] under his feet
[17:31] for in that he put all in subjection
[17:33] under him he left nothing that is not
[17:35] put under him but now
[17:38] now we see not yet all things put under
[17:42] that's a scripture that's packed with
[17:44] lots of interesting things
[17:46] let's go to the next slide but we see
[17:48] jesus
[17:50] who was made a little lower than the
[17:52] angels for the suffering of death
[17:55] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[17:57] the grace of god should take death for
[17:59] every man
[18:00] for it became him for whom are all
[18:02] things
[18:04] and by whom are all things
[18:06] and bringing many sons unto glory
[18:08] to make the captain of their salvation
[18:11] perfect through sufferings
[18:12] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[18:15] who are sanctified are all of one for
[18:17] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[18:18] them brethren
[18:20] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[18:22] brethren
[18:23] in the midst of the church will i sing
[18:25] praise unto thee
[18:27] and again i will put my trust in him
[18:30] and again behold i and the children
[18:32] which god has given me
[18:34] for as much then as the children are
[18:35] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[18:38] himself likewise took part of the same
[18:40] that through death he might destroy him
[18:43] that had the power of death
[18:45] that is the devil
[18:51] let's go to the next slide we got a few
[18:52] more verses i'm just kind of reading
[18:54] this to kind of set a little background
[18:56] so we understand what we're getting into
[18:58] and verse 15 says and deliver them who
[19:00] through fear of death
[19:02] we're all their lifetimes subject to
[19:04] bondage
[19:06] my in in that in that good that that's
[19:08] why he came to deliver us from all this
[19:10] fear and all the turmoil and to give us
[19:12] something concrete
[19:14] that we can live for him with
[19:16] for verily he took not on him the nature
[19:18] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[19:20] abraham
[19:21] wherefore in all things that behooved
[19:23] him to be made unto
[19:25] to be made like unto his brethren that
[19:27] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[19:29] priest and things pertaining to god
[19:31] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[19:34] the people there he is being a high
[19:35] priest again
[19:37] for in that he himself hath suffered
[19:39] being tempted
[19:40] he is able to sucker them that are
[19:42] tempted that's the kind of high priest
[19:44] we got is not some unfeeling man that
[19:47] that's kind of going through his life
[19:49] he's got his own problems but we've got
[19:50] somebody that can be touched by the
[19:52] feelings of our infirmities that that
[19:54] went went through the things that we
[19:56] went through and
[19:57] and and knows and understands whether
[19:59] you're a child or an old man or old lady
[20:02] or whatever it is he knows
[20:04] so let's start let's start going through
[20:06] some of these scriptures and hebrews
[20:08] chapter and i'm going to just kind of
[20:10] read some of the things that brother
[20:11] branham uh said when he was preaching
[20:13] about these things
[20:16] and in hebrews chapter 2 verse 1
[20:18] therefore we ought to give them more
[20:19] earnest heed to the things which we have
[20:21] heard lest at any time we should let
[20:22] them slip now brother adam said what
[20:24] what type of people are now he he really
[20:26] tears to hide off
[20:28] when he's getting into this what type of
[20:30] people ought we to be
[20:31] when we see the great jehovah come down
[20:33] and do the things that he does and see
[20:35] them compared scripture by scripture
[20:37] that they're the truth
[20:39] and we sit around sometimes
[20:42] like wars on a log and just so
[20:44] unconcerned
[20:46] he said we ought to be and i highlighted
[20:48] all these arts we ought to be and we
[20:50] should never be we ought to be
[20:52] busy every minute trying to get people
[20:54] to christ
[20:56] we ought to be lively stones
[20:58] we should never be slothful like we are
[21:02] why because of all that paul laid out in
[21:04] hebrews chapter one all these things
[21:06] that we have access to we ought to be
[21:08] busy for god we'll he said we'll get up
[21:10] to go to church and we'll see the lord
[21:11] jesus do something
[21:13] or bless us in such such a way and then
[21:15] we'll go back out and say
[21:18] very nice meeting
[21:20] wasn't that a good meeting
[21:23] somebody told me one time it was like
[21:24] when they said when
[21:26] i like to hear somebody when they when
[21:28] they say that they enjoy the service
[21:30] actually say something specific about
[21:32] what they enjoy to the service because a
[21:33] lot of times you know we'll kind of let
[21:34] our eyes glaze over and we we go out of
[21:37] this out of the meeting and we
[21:39] we don't really
[21:40] sometimes we just don't really it was
[21:42] just a very nice meeting
[21:44] a very a very nice get-together but
[21:47] church should be what's he saying church
[21:49] should be more than that it should be
[21:50] more than just a get-together
[21:52] why because we've got christ the high
[21:54] priest that was that came to take away
[21:56] all of our problems and and and help us
[21:59] through life and we should be we should
[22:01] be fervent we should be given everything
[22:04] we should we should come expecting
[22:07] we should come expecting to see a
[22:09] miracle in our lives
[22:12] i got i got three minutes
[22:14] we'll do a couple more verses
[22:16] uh let's go to the next slide
[22:18] and brother adam he he went on with with
[22:21] verse one he said then when we see those
[22:22] things take place that we do see take
[22:24] place enough we should never let these
[22:27] things slip
[22:28] we just let it go through our fingers
[22:31] that's what's the matter with the great
[22:32] pentecostal church today
[22:34] they've let the very cream of the crop
[22:37] slip through their fingers
[22:39] when they had it in their hands
[22:41] my goodness not recognizing what you got
[22:45] they didn't recognize what they had but
[22:46] he said but look what they've done
[22:48] they've done like the rest of the
[22:49] churches they run in the game in the way
[22:50] of coral and perished in the way of cane
[22:53] and perished in the gang saying of
[22:55] course
[22:56] and let's let's go on to the next slide
[22:58] what he said he said how did he said the
[23:01] the scripture therefore we ought to give
[23:03] the more earnest heed to the things
[23:04] which we have heard lest at any time we
[23:06] should let them slip and he said brother
[23:09] brown said people let it let things slip
[23:11] by by instead of really getting into the
[23:13] scripture we we just start all these
[23:15] arguments and we you know you you're so
[23:16] worried about who's right and who's
[23:18] wrong and everything everybody's all
[23:21] this contention and everything instead
[23:23] of just coming with humility and and
[23:26] bowing ourselves down to the word and
[23:27] just taking it like a little child and
[23:29] accepting what god said uh you know a
[23:32] lot of times
[23:34] well let's let's read what brother brown
[23:35] said he said how did the indians lose
[23:37] this country to the white man
[23:39] is because they were disunified and
[23:41] we'll end on this and the musicians can
[23:43] go ahead and start coming
[23:45] he said if they had one big forefront
[23:47] but they were fighting one among each
[23:48] other they would have held their grounds
[23:50] if they have all come together how are
[23:53] we going to lose it because we're
[23:54] disunified how we how we lose our
[23:57] experience with god is because we
[23:59] disunify
[24:00] we just unify the body of christ we
[24:02] should never be divided
[24:04] we might different ideas
[24:06] but let's be heart and heart brothers
[24:09] god wants us to be
[24:10] he died for the entire church of god
[24:13] and we do not want to be disunified
[24:16] you love him this morning
[24:19] god bless you we go into the song
[24:21] service
