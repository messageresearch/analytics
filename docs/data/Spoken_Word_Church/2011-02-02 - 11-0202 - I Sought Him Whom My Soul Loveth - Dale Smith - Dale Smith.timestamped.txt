[13:47] the
[13:50] way but that really doesn't
[13:54] matter I refuse to hear him

[23:31] in jesus' name amen God bless you
[23:34] friends if you have your Bibles we
[23:36] wouldd like for you to look into the The
[23:39] Song of
[23:41] Solomon and while you're looking for
[23:44] that it's there just in front of Isaiah

[23:49] little books in the Bible that'll be an
[23:52] easy way to find it and uh am I needing
[23:55] some no duct tape I hated it so take it

[24:21] microphone all
[24:24] right thank
[24:26] you here we
[24:33] go all right Song of Solomon everybody
[24:35] found it amen amen and we're going to
[24:38] read out of chapter three there starting
[24:41] at the first verse it says By Night on
[24:44] my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth
[24:48] I sought him but I found him not I will
[24:52] rise now and go about this city in the
[24:54] streets and in the Broadways and I will
[24:57] seek him whom my soul loveth I sought
[25:00] him but I found him not the Watchmen
[25:03] that go about the city found me to whom
[25:06] I said saw you him whom my soul loveth
[25:10] and it was but a little while that I
[25:13] passed from them but I found him whom my
[25:16] soul loveth I held him and would not let
[25:20] him go until I had brought him unto my
[25:23] mother's house and into the Chamber of
[25:26] her that had conceive me may the Lord
[25:29] bless the reading of the word this
[25:31] evening as you have your seats
[25:34] we would like
[25:36] to take a little time this evening just
[25:40] preach a little from my heart I amen was
[25:44] reading in a uh commentary of Charles
[25:49] Spurgeon and he made a note concerning
[25:53] this and just the way that he approached
[25:56] it I I I said you know that that's just
[25:59] highly preach material brother d i I
[26:03] believe you know that that there's a a
[26:05] great lesson to be learned here but as I
[26:08] studied on with the commentators of the
[26:11] the great uh man age under that man
[26:15] anointing I I I saw that they could only
[26:19] approach it uh to a point but then there
[26:23] there came this great void of
[26:25] understanding there came this the this
[26:28] place because we understand according to
[26:31] the message of the hour that there's
[26:33] there's only one provided place of
[26:35] Fellowship that we have under the under
[26:38] the revealed word of the hour and that
[26:41] that that that God has a place for us
[26:43] and that that that here was a a a woman
[26:46] this this this shulamite woman was a was
[26:50] a type of Christ and a a type of the
[26:52] Bride here and Solomon being a type of
[26:55] Christ and and as I was as I was looking
[26:58] at this we could see and look back into
[27:00] the days when when there was a time that
[27:03] that Israel fulfilled these very
[27:05] scriptures and and how that Israel would
[27:08] would would backslide and how that they
[27:10] would that they would get out of
[27:11] fellowship with God and and how that
[27:14] that that God would be removed from them
[27:16] and they would go seeking after God in
[27:19] all the wrong places right as I thought
[27:23] about that I I said you
[27:25] know history always repeats itself and
[27:29] and we know how that you know that that
[27:32] that man is just a a a habitual Sinner
[27:36] and just a creature of habit and and we
[27:39] just do the same things over and over
[27:42] again and we follow saw how that Israel
[27:45] would do the same thing that would that
[27:48] God would send him a deliver and and he
[27:50] would take them out and and and and set
[27:52] them up and put them back into
[27:53] fellowship and all they would say We'll
[27:55] serve the Lord and we'll do all these
[27:58] things and God let this Stone be a
[28:00] witness against it wouldn't be 72 hours
[28:03] and they'd be backslid as of goose and
[28:05] you wonder how in the world could they
[28:08] do those things when when God had done
[28:11] so much for
[28:12] them and then we carry it on down and we
[28:16] see
[28:17] that things don't change much you know
[28:21] people are still very much the same and
[28:23] though we can say well you know we've
[28:26] got a we've got a Holy Ghost in This
[28:29] Hour we got a but we're still people
[28:32] we're still born of a woman we still got
[28:35] inherent weaknesses that are hardwired
[28:37] into you just like they're hardwired
[28:39] into me and we still have a tendency to
[28:43] fall on our face and and we we we even
[28:47] with the Holy Ghost friends I I'm here
[28:49] to tell you people make some of the most
[28:52] rational decisions and mistakes in their
[28:54] life and we we just seem to but here we
[28:58] see this woman and the scripture says
[29:02] that it was by night and so we see here
[29:05] that it was a dark time that it was a
[29:07] that it was a time where uh you know it
[29:11] was it was a a confused hour that she
[29:16] was in you ever wake up in the night and
[29:19] and wonder I I don't know which way I'm
[29:21] laying in the bed and and you know you
[29:24] you you turn one way you're all to fall
[29:26] out but yeah you turn the other way and
[29:28] you mind you don't know and you you find
[29:30] yourself in a in a confused State there
[29:33] and so we see that this was a a dark
[29:36] time it was a night time and so she says
[29:40] well I I said to myself where is he that
[29:44] my soul loveth where is he the one that
[29:47] my soul loveth and and she began to look
[29:50] for him in the bedroom and in the places
[29:53] where she thought he ought to be you
[29:56] know ought have been there uh she she
[29:58] that's the first place she looked and
[29:59] then she said well he's not here so I
[30:02] must go into the into the city I got to
[30:05] go out into the streets and into the
[30:08] Broadways and and we find that as she
[30:10] went looking for him he wasn't nowhere
[30:13] to be found yeah right yeah
[30:17] right but I asked the question this
[30:20] evening why wasn't he found yeah right
[30:24] she you would have thought she would
[30:26] have been the one to know where he was
[30:30] this one that are soul
[30:33] loved but we find that the scripture
[30:36] here shows us that that she went in all
[30:39] the wrong places oh yeah that's right we
[30:42] we realize that Christ spirit is a is a
[30:48] a a dove Spirit a Meek spirit it's a
[30:52] lamb nature and it has these the this is
[30:56] the way that Christ wasn't and Christ
[30:59] the word the the the the Holy Spirit it
[31:02] doesn't go out and mingle with a bunch
[31:04] of confusion amen right you're not going
[31:07] to find Christ Spirit uh and all this
[31:10] this loud stuff that they that they got
[31:13] going on in the streets and and and
[31:15] carrying on in the Broadway why just the
[31:18] very fact that she would call it the
[31:20] Broadway would tell you that Christ
[31:23] wasn't going to be there when would
[31:25] Christ ever be on Broadway amen you see
[31:29] or Hollywood right where Christ would
[31:32] never be in those places and Solomon
[31:35] here was a was the mystery of Jehovah
[31:40] revealed you see he was a type of the
[31:42] brid a type of the husband the type of
[31:45] the king the type of the Lord and here
[31:48] this woman was a shite she was a type of
[31:51] The Virtuous bride and here she was
[31:54] looking for him but she was looking in
[31:56] all the wrong places we find that people
[31:58] get so confused many times they think
[32:00] that he's in a big church or in a big
[32:02] denomination or in a big system
[32:04] somewhere oh a big program a big
[32:07] education a big politics a big
[32:09] government God ain't never in those
[32:11] places he ain't never revealed his he
[32:14] always reveals himself in Simplicity
[32:17] that's right brother right amen here was
[32:20] this woman
[32:23] looking lost the company of
[32:28] Christ can you imagine out of
[32:33] Fellowship any time that we leave the
[32:38] word we leave Christ right that's right
[32:42] any time we walk away from the revealed
[32:46] word of God we walk away from
[32:51] Christ in the beginning was the word the
[32:53] word was with God the Word was God and
[32:56] the word word became flesh so we see
[32:59] that the son of man is the re revelation
[33:02] of the word for the hour that we live in
[33:04] it's the word made flesh again amen
[33:08] that's right and
[33:13] so we find
[33:15] that I like how Spurgeon says this you
[33:17] tell me where you lost the company of
[33:19] Christ and I will tell you the most
[33:23] likely place to find it right we found
[33:26] that that that soldier who had been out
[33:28] on the battlefield and he was he was cut
[33:30] through with a machine gun I believe it
[33:32] was or strael or something like that he
[33:35] was laying there on the ground bleeding
[33:36] out and and there the the chaplain came
[33:39] to him and and said Son are you a
[33:42] Christian do you know God he said well I
[33:45] once knew him he said well when did you
[33:47] he said you do you know him now son
[33:49] you're fixing to go and meet your maker
[33:52] you're fixing the face almighty God how
[33:54] do you know him now what's your
[33:56] condition now I said well I don't know
[33:58] he said well where did you know him yeah
[34:01] said you got to go back to where you
[34:03] knew him that's the place you've got to
[34:05] find Christ is go back where you last
[34:08] felt him the last place you knew him you
[34:10] got to go back there and that condition
[34:13] oh that boy began to pray now I'll lay
[34:16] me down to sleep am he had a cradle
[34:22] religion oh man he had KN known God and
[34:26] the and the and in the nursery oh I want
[34:29] to God that people amen would Shake
[34:32] themselves and wonder have you ever
[34:33] known Christ outside of the nursery
[34:36] outside of your Sunday school experience
[34:38] when the last time you had fellowship
[34:41] with
[34:43] Christ a real experience with God
[34:48] right where did you lose him did you
[34:51] lose him in the closet yeah in your
[34:55] prayer closet oh my
[34:57] and when's the last time you visited him
[34:59] there yeah when's the last time we had a
[35:02] an hour of restraining prayer Amen in a
[35:05] time where we supplicated with God we
[35:07] call ourselves the Church of the Living
[35:09] God and we have no fellowship with
[35:12] Christ oh but we have plenty of
[35:14] fellowship with the sports stadium and
[35:16] plenty of Fellowship over here with the
[35:18] movie house and all kinds of Fellowship
[35:21] here and there oh let me tell you what
[35:23] Fellowship has Christ with below what
[35:25] Fellowship has with Darkness amen oh you
[35:28] got to find him in that place of
[35:30] pleading prayer that's where you'll find
[35:33] him if that's where you left him
[35:36] right did you lose Christ by sin
[35:42] yeah that's some besetting sin some
[35:45] little stubborn thing that you won't
[35:47] repent of and you know God's convicted
[35:49] you over and over and over and over and
[35:51] over again you still keep coming back to
[35:53] the the same place and the same
[35:55] conviction and the same condemnation in
[35:57] your soul oh let me tell you amen the pl
[36:00] the one that your soul loveth that's the
[36:02] one that's lost many times our you know
[36:05] we find that we're a Triune being we
[36:07] we're a body we're a spirit and we're a
[36:09] soul and we find that many times I I'm
[36:12] friend your your your flesh never did
[36:15] love God oh my my Bible says you were an
[36:18] alien you were born in sin shaped in
[36:21] iniquity that you uh you were dead in
[36:24] trespasses and sins and in times past
[36:27] walked according to the course of this
[36:29] world according to the prince and the
[36:31] power of the Earth the spirit that now
[36:33] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[36:35] that was your flesh that's your flesh
[36:38] and your flesh unchecked and un
[36:40] unrestrained by God Amen it'll lead you
[36:43] right straight back into the water where
[36:45] you come out of amen that's
[36:50] right but the scripture also says among
[36:52] whom
[36:53] also we had our conversation in times
[36:56] past
[36:57] in the lust of our
[37:00] flesh fulfilling the desires of our
[37:05] minds your spirit man right you see and
[37:09] so that Spirit man it don't love God
[37:11] either never did love God always
[37:14] captivated by its imagination by its
[37:17] memory by its conscience and by its
[37:19] affections amen why it was it was always
[37:21] captivated by those things that were
[37:23] around him because the things that were
[37:25] around him had ACC to those there was
[37:28] doors through the flesh there was doors
[37:30] through the spirit but the scripture
[37:32] says the one that my soul love it oh let
[37:36] me tell you amen there was an election
[37:38] that was laying there there was a little
[37:39] woman amen by the well and she she was
[37:43] an outcast of society married four times
[37:47] or five times and living with another
[37:49] and no fellowship with God but Jesus
[37:52] said I have needs to go by way of
[37:54] Samaria why because there was a little
[37:56] woman there that had something on the
[37:58] inside of her soul amen that God could
[38:01] identify
[38:04] with we find then that when Christ be to
[38:07] call oh from the from the regions of the
[38:10] Lost amen that little woman amen when
[38:13] Christ was standing there oh that little
[38:16] that seed germ amen that was down inside
[38:18] her it began to bring that Spirit woman
[38:21] it began to bring that flesh woman under
[38:23] subjection to that Soul woman oh let me
[38:26] tell you this what we need tonight is as
[38:29] a as our soul to fall in love with
[38:31] Christ
[38:32] again and it'll bring all the rest of
[38:35] you into subjection to the
[38:37] word that's right did you lose Christ by
[38:42] neglecting the
[38:44] scriptures we find so many times that
[38:48] people you know you start out serving
[38:50] God and you read the scriptures every
[38:52] day and every
[38:53] night it's it's ever on your mind study
[38:56] the word listen to a tape study the word
[39:00] go to church hear the preaching oh but
[39:02] then after a little while so many things
[39:04] begin to take the place oh don't you
[39:07] realize that's the words of your lover
[39:10] that's the words of the one that your
[39:12] soul loveth oh my can you imagine a
[39:16] relationship where the husband he would
[39:18] just you know he would just come in
[39:20] maybe you know uh in the evening sit
[39:22] down pick up his newspaper drink his tea
[39:25] or his coffee or whatever to have a
[39:26] little dinner go to bed wake up the next
[39:28] morning go to work go on about his way
[39:30] life she gets up she goes through her
[39:32] routine and the only ships passing in
[39:34] the night they only see once another
[39:36] talk to one another you know on
[39:37] occasional B why that relationship would
[39:40] fall apart in just a matter of months
[39:42] amen exactly they go on and on and on
[39:45] like that until finally they wonder and
[39:47] the kids are grown and the kids are
[39:49] raised and they're moved out of the
[39:50] house and then a man and a woman now
[39:52] they got the empty nest and they look at
[39:53] each other they don't even they don't
[39:54] even know each other right
[39:57] that's right oh why is it how how would
[40:00] that be your relationship would that be
[40:02] a a synopsis of your relationship with
[40:04] Christ that you were just ships passing
[40:06] in the night you saw him at church amen
[40:09] you heard him on a t you just passed by
[40:11] and me you didn't pay a whole lot of
[40:13] attention in there had no real
[40:15] relationship with Christ he couldn't
[40:17] move on your soul and cause you to to
[40:19] weep and to and to come into some sort
[40:21] of a a spiritual relationship where he
[40:24] meant more to you than life or breath or
[40:26] your necessary food oh would Christ ever
[40:30] come to a place like that in a man's
[40:32] life why you would seek Him day and
[40:34] night he would long for him in the night
[40:37] would search for him everywhere he
[40:40] could wouldn't be satisfied until he
[40:43] found him amen oh that I knew where I
[40:46] might find him oh it's dangerous to be
[40:50] without the lord it's dangerous oh it be
[40:53] like sheep without Shepherd it' be like
[40:56] like a tree without water oh let me tell
[40:59] you friends we need Christ this evening
[41:04] amen then I thought something
[41:09] here that
[41:11] the scripture says that she was going
[41:14] out into the City and looking everywhere
[41:17] then the Bible says
[41:19] that she says but the
[41:23] Watchman yeah the Watchman amen that
[41:26] went about the
[41:28] city found me yeah she wasn't looking
[41:32] for them right but they found her oh
[41:36] yeah now I thought this was striking and
[41:39] so once they found her then she thought
[41:43] well these are some Authority these are
[41:45] some kind of a you know some sort of an
[41:48] office that I maybe I could make a
[41:49] request to and she says have you seen
[41:53] the one that my soul loveth and then we
[41:56] see a like a breach in the scripture we
[41:59] see like a like a like there's like a
[42:01] Vortex or a void now in the word that
[42:04] there's no other communication between
[42:06] them and then we just find her the next
[42:08] thing we know that she's embracing the
[42:10] one that she loved yeah and you begin to
[42:12] wonder what happened
[42:14] here what happened they found her then
[42:17] she found him yeah something something
[42:20] happened there you know and and as I so
[42:23] I said well then surely these Great Men
[42:25] of God and so I went back through the
[42:27] commentary page after page of of
[42:30] reference to this very passage of
[42:32] scripture and they all said well she was
[42:34] having a
[42:35] dream and she didn't know where she was
[42:38] it's is all an allegory that one one
[42:42] commentator even said that that many
[42:44] people believe that the Song of Solomon
[42:46] was just erotic songs that Solomon wrote
[42:48] to his many women yeah had no spiritual
[42:52] bearing at all and then others said well
[42:56] they they found her and they they just
[42:58] thought she was deranged and that she
[43:00] didn't know what she was looking for and
[43:02] they didn't know who she was looking for
[43:03] anyways and and oh my and they just went
[43:06] on and on and on and on and I thought
[43:09] what how is it that you could see
[43:12] something in the scripture uh uh like a
[43:14] Watchman on the wall and not and be a
[43:17] theologian and not be able to reference
[43:19] the word amen back into the prophetic
[43:22] utterances of Isaiah where Isaiah amen
[43:25] references this scripture of the
[43:27] Watchman it says Watchman what of the
[43:30] night oh my how they could not see that
[43:33] this Watchman was significant in the
[43:36] scripture and that this Watchman that he
[43:38] bore a reference throughout Bible type
[43:41] and Bible
[43:43] example amen they Carri it from Genesis
[43:45] to Revelation you see every time that
[43:48] God had to get through to his people
[43:50] that he set a person a single messenger
[43:54] up above the others and to point the
[43:56] people in the right direction oh my how
[43:59] they could not see that and I thought my
[44:01] that's just so obvious in the scripture
[44:03] why why wouldn't they see that why
[44:05] couldn't they see that this Watchman now
[44:06] then here it uses a plural reference did
[44:10] you notice that Watchmen and so I have
[44:13] to I have to say that that is that was
[44:15] not done by accident but that had to be
[44:18] done on purpose that God Amen that
[44:21] though there would be a singular
[44:24] Watchman even in the milit we had what
[44:26] we call the Corporal of the Guard or the
[44:29] sergeant of the Guard or the officer of
[44:31] the Guard there was there was one that
[44:32] was over the rest of the guards right
[44:36] and they operated under that set of
[44:38] instructions and that's what they did
[44:39] they had a certain route that they had
[44:41] to take a beat that they had to walk
[44:43] I've walked many a cold night amen
[44:45] guarding nothing but a bunch of empty
[44:47] empty old damn tracks amen freezing
[44:49] myself to death out there wonder why
[44:51] would anybody want to steal this bunch
[44:53] of
[44:54] junk but it was my job I didn't have to
[44:58] I couldn't go there and say Hey Sergeant
[45:00] guard I don't want to watch this stuff
[45:02] it's cold out there it's Christmas Eve
[45:04] and this is a bunch of broken down am
[45:07] tras who's going to steal an Amtrak
[45:10] right I couldn't ask that question
[45:13] wasn't my job to ask that question I had
[45:15] a post I had to be there and I was I was
[45:18] I was ordered to be there oh let me tell
[45:21] you friends that there's a there's a
[45:23] five-fold Ministry amen that God has
[45:26] Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and
[45:28] teachers Amen to perfect the Saints Amen
[45:31] to walk in the word amen to stay under
[45:33] the ERS amen are their Chief Watchman
[45:36] that's right that's right and so but I
[45:40] saw here why did they not why didn't I
[45:44] why couldn't they see that it's obvious
[45:47] to me that that Watchman showed her
[45:50] where he was am it's obvious to me but
[45:53] they all said nothing the scripture is
[45:55] is silent there and I thought wasn't
[45:58] that something then my mind began to go
[46:01] back and I thought hey that that's
[46:03] another place in the Bible that does
[46:06] that over in the seals when the seals
[46:09] are being brought forth and you get to
[46:11] the Sixth Seal it ends up in the sixth
[46:15] chapter of
[46:16] Revelations but then we have this this
[46:19] this it's like a an injection of a whole
[46:23] another chapter of the Bible the whole
[46:25] seven chapter is dropped in there and
[46:28] then you go over to chapter eight and it
[46:30] picks up the seventh seal right and it
[46:33] says it talks about a a half hour
[46:35] silence and things but we find that
[46:38] under the half hour silence that was
[46:40] really the revelation of that was really
[46:42] over in chapter 7 come on right because
[46:45] it was over in chapter 7 that we have a
[46:48] prophet to the Gentiles it's over in
[46:50] chapter 7 that we have those Messengers
[46:52] go back to the church of Israel we find
[46:55] all these things happened in that
[46:56] seventh chapter but yet between the
[46:58] sixth and the and the and the seventh
[47:01] seal there's this whole message that's
[47:04] delivered inside of there and what was
[47:06] it but it was to point the people back
[47:09] to Christ the lover of their souls
[47:12] amen that's right now then the the the
[47:14] the system missed it yeah sure well they
[47:17] just let her wander they just let her
[47:20] wand oh those watch when the the Bible
[47:22] talks about those pastors he said that
[47:25] they don't feed their
[47:26] their Church they don't feed the
[47:27] children they're they're they're Wicked
[47:29] they don't do those thingsbody said
[47:30] there's going to be some pastors that
[47:32] will feed their people there's going to
[47:33] be some pastors that'll take care of the
[47:35] flock of God that's right but there was
[47:37] these ones that didn't what did they do
[47:39] they let her go off out into predition
[47:41] again led the blind the blind leading
[47:44] the blind oh but my here was this one
[47:48] that these Messengers that told this
[47:51] little woman here he is the one that
[47:53] you're so loving he's the one where is
[47:55] he not on the highway he's not in the
[47:57] big system he's not in the big
[47:59] organization but he's here hidden in the
[48:01] word amen brought him over to the
[48:03] revealed word of the hour said this is
[48:06] the one that your soul
[48:08] loveth that's right he
[48:13] says but
[48:15] watch prophet of God picks up those
[48:18] those uh the Magi the wise men he said
[48:23] we have seen his star in the east right
[48:27] right now then so here they come and
[48:32] they present this as some Christmas
[48:34] Story oh my and they' got these Magi
[48:39] looking into the Eastern sky
[48:41] right that's not even the way that it
[48:44] happened they were in the East looking
[48:48] to the West right that's how they saw
[48:50] the star and so but you you find here
[48:54] that they were reading the scripture and
[48:57] they saw in the Bible that a star would
[49:00] rise out of Judah and they begin looking
[49:03] for that star now we realize that that
[49:06] star that they saw it passed by every
[49:08] observatory in the country right nobody
[49:11] saw it but an elected group right only
[49:14] those three saw they went rocking right
[49:16] by staring right we following the star
[49:18] what star yeah everybody else said what
[49:21] star what are you looking at where did
[49:23] it go we haven't seen it yeah and the
[49:25] prophet of God said they didn't see it
[49:28] because they were not looking for
[49:31] it they weren't looking for it Oh my he
[49:35] says that's how we can come in these
[49:37] churches Heen we we see the supernatural
[49:40] happen all around it we didn't see
[49:41] anything yeah yeah come on weren't
[49:44] looking for it that's right that's right
[49:50] watch I like
[49:53] this he says these Holiness people
[49:57] whatever you want to call
[49:59] yourself he says I don't see nothing
[50:02] because you're not looking for it oh but
[50:05] you usually get what you're looking for
[50:09] that's right it's right you you get what
[50:13] you're looking for now
[50:16] then just want to recap just for a
[50:18] second here hit some of these I thought
[50:21] the wording here is very good he says
[50:23] and it's between the sixth and the
[50:25] seventh seal that this interval is
[50:29] given now we want to notice this very
[50:33] important that we notice this little
[50:37] time right it was just a little time
[50:40] based you know in comparison to the
[50:41] whole grand scheme of things the the
[50:44] message of the hour the the unfolding of
[50:46] the seals the the the the the the the
[50:48] the breaking forth of the Mysteries and
[50:50] all even brother Ram's entire Ministry
[50:52] was actually very small space of time on
[50:55] the grand scheme of things but it was a
[50:57] time there where there was a Watchman
[51:00] that could deliver a message now then
[51:02] when he delivered a message then he says
[51:05] now there's going to be men that will
[51:07] pick this message up and will carry them
[51:10] out to the Rapture right yeah oh my what
[51:14] was it but it was to carry this little
[51:17] woman this little virtuous woman and was
[51:19] going to carry her in a way that was
[51:23] would be pleasing to God and would carry
[51:25] her into the presence of the one that
[51:28] her soul
[51:31] lth
[51:32] watch so between the sixth and seventh
[51:35] trumpet there's a prophet who appeared
[51:37] before the Gentiles to call the people
[51:39] back to the
[51:41] original Pentecostal
[51:44] Doctrine you see so the the things that
[51:48] were restored are were just that
[51:50] restored they're not new this is not a
[51:54] new doctrine it's not a new movement
[51:57] it's not anything new but this is a
[51:59] restoring back to the original and I
[52:02] want you to see something here he says
[52:04] it's between the seventh Angel's message
[52:07] that has been preaching and condemning
[52:10] the
[52:10] Pentecostals you see why because they
[52:13] denominated went out into the Broadways
[52:16] went out into big organization and
[52:18] colleges and hospitals and huge uh uh
[52:21] building programs of multi-million and
[52:24] billion dollar or ganizations and got
[52:27] their mind off of Christ and got their
[52:29] mind on to their own systems that's
[52:32] right that's where they deviated you see
[52:34] right amen but watch this message of the
[52:37] Watchman would condemn those things oh
[52:40] yeah sure condemn it yep that's right
[52:43] wouldn't have nothing to do with
[52:45] it but when he would when when he would
[52:48] do that then the system because that's
[52:51] what people inherently want they wanted
[52:55] the Tower of Babel oh yeah they wanted
[52:57] the the masses in the days of Noah they
[53:00] wanted the the the the pleasures of
[53:02] Egypt in the days of Moses we found that
[53:05] people continually rebelled against God
[53:08] and condemned Moses and LOE the light
[53:11] bread which was the very thing that God

[54:37] this into cabbage going down
[54:41] you
[54:44] amen oh don't you love
[54:47] him but now I'm bringing you to
[54:49] something here that here was this
[54:53] messenger that we have to it has to line
[54:56] up with the scripture right if it
[54:58] doesn't line up with the scripture then
[55:00] it's not a true Watchman because that
[55:03] Watchman could not be M sighted he
[55:06] couldn't be half blind with a patch on
[55:07] one eye he had to have a man that was
[55:10] had eyesight not only that but he had to
[55:13] have a thorough understanding of the
[55:15] stars of the heavens because his job was
[55:19] to look into the stars of the heaven and
[55:21] he would see that all right or Orion is
[55:23] in it I don't know anything about these
[55:25] things I'm just giving you an example
[55:26] would say it's in this third phase or in
[55:28] this fourth phase and that'd be in the
[55:30] fall of the year you know Ryan the
[55:31] hunter that's why we hunt the time of
[55:33] that's where the animals are are you
[55:35] know it's good to kill them at that time
[55:36] of the year because they don't have
[55:37] young with them and stuff and and and
[55:39] there coming on winter time and the the
[55:41] weak are going to die anyways so it's a
[55:43] it's a natural thing and so here uh here
[55:46] was O was coming into his position he
[55:49] know it'd be dropping over into the
[55:51] sunset you into the into the into the
[55:53] west and and so but if you didn't know
[55:55] what oion look like then you wouldn't
[55:57] know where oion was and so you I'm just
[56:01] using him as an example and and and so
[56:03] here here this Watchman you know some
[56:06] weary Christian would come out of his
[56:08] house in the middle of the night he
[56:09] couldn't sleep and oh just burden down
[56:11] he say
[56:13] what what of the
[56:15] night well if it you know if it was one
[56:18] or two in the morning he' say well we
[56:20] see Orion's high in the skies probably
[56:23] around you know 1 2 in the morning
[56:25] something like that there was there
[56:26] wasn't really a clock then they they
[56:28] would just tell me is in the you know be
[56:30] the first watch or the second watch or
[56:32] whatever it would be and he' say oh my
[56:35] oh I got to go back to bed and so he'd
[56:37] stagger back in there and you he' try to
[56:39] go maybe go have some warm milk or
[56:41] something eat him some onions or
[56:42] something go to sleep you know and so it
[56:45] would he would try to try to get himself
[56:47] you say why you eat onions onions help
[56:49] you go to sleep you know that yeah they
[56:51] have opium in them there like an opiate
[56:53] in there helps you it's like a narcotic
[56:54] put you to sleep turkey will do that
[56:56] dark dark meat turkey will do that too
[56:59] yeah they get you an onion turkey
[57:01] sandwich sleep like a
[57:05] baby won't get No Interruption your
[57:08] breath will smell like a goat by the way
[57:10] there you
[57:14] go yeah that's right and so hey but what
[57:19] be asking that Washman what hour is it
[57:23] and that's what we find that people you
[57:25] know I I heard someone here the other
[57:27] day say it was talking about um it was
[57:30] on a it was on a a web thing it was they
[57:33] were given the exact time and exact date
[57:35] of the coming of the Lord oh my it was
[57:37] going to be May the 14th of uh I maybe
[57:41] it might have been this year or
[57:42] something like that oh my and what if he
[57:45] don't come at that hour what credibility
[57:48] will that Watchman have oh my my
[57:51] Watchman said look up look up your day
[57:54] Redemption is here friends amen
[57:57] Redemption is here upon us it's not
[57:59] something we look off out into the
[58:00] future I'm not looking in two weeks I'm
[58:03] not looking in two years Heen he could
[58:05] come before the night is
[58:06] over say Watchman what of the night if
[58:09] he's a true
[58:11] Watchman and he'll tell you what to look
[58:13] for right man what to see now watch
[58:17] because he's he knows about those things
[58:19] he'll see the historic evidences of
[58:21] Christ and where that Christ is the same
[58:24] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8
[58:26] he'll see those things he'll point you
[58:28] to those things he'll point you to True
[58:30] Bible uh doctrines of of of the
[58:33] ordinances of the of the of the Bible of
[58:35] water baptism the Lord's Supper of foot
[58:38] washing he'll tell you these things
[58:39] correctly according to the word of God
[58:42] he'll point you to to to the right
[58:44] things of the of the word of God in your
[58:46] domestic affairs of marriage and divorce
[58:48] he'll point you to those things he'll
[58:49] tell you amen where the where the
[58:51] security of the believer is he'll tell
[58:53] you those things that's right because
[58:54] because he's a true Watchman of the
[58:57] word not only that but this Watchman
[59:02] also would know the
[59:06] enemy in the daytime those watch them
[59:08] would stand on the on there and they
[59:10] would look out uh through primitive
[59:12] means through the little little Optics
[59:14] that they had and they would look out on
[59:15] the horizon and if they see the
[59:17] standards or the insides of these
[59:20] different armies that were approaching
[59:22] then they would say oh well that's
[59:23] that's Judah coming over to visit
[59:25] Benjamin well that's our buddy let's
[59:27] open the doors make them welcome kill a
[59:30] fatted calf where you we're going to
[59:31] have a party that's a it's a great time
[59:33] a Great Fellowship we're going to we're
[59:35] going to give these uh soldiers of a of
[59:38] our Brethren we're going to give them
[59:39] meat but if he looked out across there
[59:41] and he'd say hey that looks like them's
[59:44] Philistine banners them's Philistine
[59:47] banners he say board up this place let's
[59:49] put put soldiers out on the walls let's
[59:52] defend ourselves is that right would
[59:54] have to be well knowledged in the
[59:57] enemy's tactics he would be able to see
[1:00:00] the movements he'd be able to call it
[1:00:02] back down to the armies what to prepare
[1:00:04] themselves for
[1:00:06] right so we'd have to have long Vision
[1:00:10] be able to see it amen right I
[1:00:13] appreciate God sending a a a Watchman in
[1:00:17] our day amen I do because he was able to
[1:00:20] look out from
[1:00:21] 1932 and give us specifics that we could
[1:00:24] look for and we could we could actually
[1:00:27] we could actually Bank on those things
[1:00:30] mean that that we would not be that that
[1:00:32] we wouldn't be concerned or we wouldn't
[1:00:34] be confused as to whether or not that
[1:00:37] this was the right thing or not and that
[1:00:39] God would stand behind it and vindicate
[1:00:41] that message that's right but not only
[1:00:47] that but the
[1:00:49] people that would respect that
[1:00:53] message that there would be a provision
[1:00:55] made right yeah the Bible tells us that
[1:00:58] if the Watchman warned the people MH and
[1:01:01] the people
[1:01:02] prepare that the blood if they if they
[1:01:05] lose the battle that the blood would not
[1:01:07] be on the watchman's hands but it would
[1:01:10] be on the people's hands because they
[1:01:11] did not prepare or for whatever reason
[1:01:13] they lost the battle you know just never
[1:01:16] there's all kinds of uh variables there
[1:01:18] but the the Watchman did his job that
[1:01:20] was the main thing he said but if he saw
[1:01:22] the enemy did not warn the people said
[1:01:25] then the blood would be upon his hands
[1:01:28] right all right so now that's very
[1:01:31] important because we see then that this
[1:01:34] Watchman begin to tell the people what
[1:01:37] to look for amen right that's right we
[1:01:41] find that the Watchman begin to point
[1:01:42] forward and he said look out when you
[1:01:45] see the world the women of the world
[1:01:49] becoming more and more beautiful he said
[1:01:51] know that it's a flashing red light
[1:01:54] light of his coming that's right amen
[1:01:57] and when you see that that that he he
[1:02:00] preached a message the God of this evil
[1:02:03] age he began to show how that the the
[1:02:07] the the idol of this Modern Age would be
[1:02:10] a half-dressed woman some sex goddess
[1:02:13] some queen that they would put out you
[1:02:15] look at the day today everything that's
[1:02:18] out there whether it be advertisement
[1:02:20] whether it be Hollywood movies anything
[1:02:23] churches
[1:02:24] oh churches advertised how they do it
[1:02:28] Benny H wasn't going nowhere he got rid
[1:02:30] of his little humble wife amen got him a
[1:02:32] sex Queen a went National y oh yeah sure
[1:02:36] you know Nation Global whatever he went
[1:02:38] here that just happened here recently
[1:02:41] you look at them you look at all these
[1:02:42] name band preachers what do they got to
[1:02:44] do they God if they don't have a sex
[1:02:46] Queen for a wife they'll put her away
[1:02:48] and get him one right oh my that's right
[1:02:52] oh what is it everywhere you look a it's
[1:02:55] just one goddess after another
[1:02:57] Billboards plastered all over what was
[1:02:59] it was a sign to get ready to go amen
[1:03:03] right was it was a sign to get ready to
[1:03:06] go he talked about how that the women
[1:03:08] would be in
[1:03:09] politics and even to the point that
[1:03:11] there would be that there would be one
[1:03:13] that would rise up and actually be of a
[1:03:16] great power like a a vice president or
[1:03:18] something yeah right well we've already
[1:03:21] wait we're we're that close and maybe
[1:03:23] even a little closer if we really knew
[1:03:25] what the truth of the matter was right
[1:03:27] sure we don't know where that is but we
[1:03:29] do know that there that that's a sign
[1:03:31] there was never a day in 1932 do you
[1:03:34] think a woman Congressman well that
[1:03:36] would have never went over right that
[1:03:39] would have never went over a woman
[1:03:41] politician are you crazy that wasn't

[1:03:45] rocks at them in the street because they

[1:06:21] of course they were in The Tavern
[1:06:23] drinking and party and going on the
[1:06:25] soldiers were all drinking they were

[1:07:12] judgments of God until God can take out
[1:07:15] the elect right

[1:10:08] shouts back the morning
[1:10:12] cometh and the night
[1:10:15] also he says what look at the continuity
[1:10:19] of the scripture how that it follows
[1:10:22] nature
[1:10:24] that the morning cometh that's a given
[1:10:28] we know it's coming but the night also
[1:10:30] what is that you know and he says you
[1:10:33] look at when that when that sun is
[1:10:35] rising what does it do but it congeals
[1:10:38] those atmospheres it pushes begins to
[1:10:40] push that Darkness to where the darkest
[1:10:43] hour is just before the dawn right amen
[1:10:46] the darkest time of the night the
[1:10:48] coldest hour that's when the the
[1:10:50] condensation comes on the clothes line
[1:10:52] that's when the when the fro sets in and
[1:10:55] what is it it's that cold dark hour
[1:10:57] that's where she was looking for her
[1:10:59] lover she went out in that time and he
[1:11:01] said watch when one of the night he said
[1:11:03] the morning cometh right the morning

[1:11:24] said but the darkness comes also yeah
[1:11:27] the Night comes too there's two things
[1:11:29] that are coming right we see that the
[1:11:31] Bible says that there was Darkness upon
[1:11:34] the Earth right and gross Darkness upon
[1:11:38] the people that's right yeah you see
[1:11:40] what was it that their minds became
[1:11:42] alienated like it was in the days of
[1:11:45] Sodom and gomorra where their hearts
[1:11:47] were continually on evil y oh he said
[1:11:51] but there was going to be some that
[1:11:53] would be watching for the morning
[1:11:56] right watching for the morning
[1:12:06] right inject something
[1:12:10] here so if you can me consider me to be
[1:12:13] his servant just before the break of day
[1:12:16] that's why this horrible Gloom is over
[1:12:18] the Earth it's just before the coming of
[1:12:21] the Lord Jesus there's no more hope left
[1:12:24] in nothing but his coming GL nations are
[1:12:28] against Nations they have they have
[1:12:29] fooled through God's laboratory till now
[1:12:32] they've got enough power now to blow one
[1:12:33] another into one another into Atomic
[1:12:35] ashes and they're Wicked and they're
[1:12:38] unreligious and they're un Christlike
[1:12:40] and the only motive that they have an
[1:12:42] objective is to destroy and they are
[1:12:45] inspired by a destroying angel that was
[1:12:48] sent from heaven to inspire these men oh
[1:12:51] yeah sure amen and so here the these
[1:12:53] Angels were waiting for the opportunity
[1:12:57] they were just waiting for the nod from
[1:12:58] God to to loose their vials and their
[1:13:01] loose their plagues upon the Earth but
[1:13:04] the Bible says that he that lth will let
[1:13:06] until he be taken out of the way he was
[1:13:09] a was a person of Christ in the church
[1:13:12] when that church is lifted out and then
[1:13:14] the destroying angles are relased
[1:13:17] released upon the earth oh but let me

[1:15:46] the tower to Tower in men not just a
[1:15:49] single man yeah right that's where you

[1:15:53] ministry and brother BR he also had
[1:15:55] great Ministries and and other men down
[1:15:57] Through the Ages brother Brown spoke so
[1:15:59] highly of Charles finny abely you know
[1:16:01] spoke highly of Smith
[1:16:23] turned a blind eye to him wouldn't pay
[1:16:25] no attention
[1:16:27] right but watch what he says here the
[1:16:30] Holy Spirit has sent us a Watchman that
[1:16:32] watches over us he is our Guardian the
[1:16:35] Holy Spirit was sent to lead man to be
[1:16:38] the Watchman of our soul exactly right
[1:16:43] man wasn't to watch over one another it
[1:16:46] was the Holy Spirit to watch over us
[1:16:48] he's our tutor our teacher the holy
[1:16:49] spirit is to teach us then we cry out to
[1:16:52] the holy Spirit looking at these things
[1:16:55] Watchman what the amen we call out to
[1:16:59] the Watchman the Holy Spirit the one
[1:17:01] that was that was that was enthroned
[1:17:03] that was towered in our souls that was
[1:17:06] to to draw our attention to a word there
[1:17:09] to draw our attention to a to a to an
[1:17:11] intelligence an intelligence of this day
[1:17:14] right oh but yet not to get ourselves
[1:17:16] confused with things that are around us
[1:17:18] or other things or other messages but
[1:17:20] but to focus on what God's purpose is
[1:17:23] for this hour just in this in closing
[1:17:26] now we find that this
[1:17:29] woman when she found this one that her
[1:17:32] soul loveth oh yeah look what she did
[1:17:35] the Bible says that she embraced him
[1:17:38] that she held on to him and she says and
[1:17:40] I will not let him go would not let him
[1:17:44] go oh would to God that we would have an
[1:17:47] experience tonight that we could we
[1:17:49] would take a hold of Christ and that we
[1:17:51] would not let him go GL but Watch What
[1:17:55] Happens she says and I took
[1:17:58] him to my mother's house yeah into the
[1:18:02] Chamber of her that conceived me yeah
[1:18:06] now watch this this this points right
[1:18:10] back to the scripture in Joel that says
[1:18:14] all the years that the pommer worm the
[1:18:16] korm the caterpillar all these years
[1:18:19] that they have taken away he says I will
[1:18:22] restore amen say the Lord I'm going to
[1:18:25] restore this I'm going to bring it back
[1:18:28] watch he's going to bring it back to
[1:18:29] what it was in the beginning a full
[1:18:33] bride tree is that right now that we
[1:18:35] find what also that the prophet of God
[1:18:37] preached us a message he says what was
[1:18:39] the three-fold purpose of God to
[1:18:42] manifest himself to have preeminence in
[1:18:45] the church and to restore that church
[1:18:48] back to an Eden condition to take the
[1:18:51] church back to to the Genesis back to
[1:18:54] the beginning look where she took him
[1:18:56] amen not to the place where she had lost
[1:18:59] him but she took him back to the place
[1:19:01] where she was conceived took him back to
[1:19:03] the original Pentecostal Doctrine where
[1:19:06] she was birthed on the day of
[1:19:08] Pentecost oh my that's where that's the
[1:19:12] message of the hour is to restore us
[1:19:14] back to take us back to Genesis to take
[1:19:17] us back to the original Pentecostal
[1:19:18] Doctrine and and it it's not to take us
[1:19:21] off into the misty blue some where oh no
[1:19:24] sir friends you know and and I always
[1:19:26] say it like this you know if if if you
[1:19:29] know if that's not the
[1:19:31] message then how is this how is this
[1:19:34] tree that is supposed to put forth
[1:19:36] another Branch right yeah he said if
[1:19:38] it's another Branch it'll be just like
[1:19:41] the first one right
[1:19:43] amen because he's the same yesterday
[1:19:45] today and forever God is not going to
[1:19:47] have respects to anything but that book
[1:19:49] of Acts church that's it that's the only
[1:19:53] thing and so now that they look for it
[1:19:55] down through the church ages that we've
[1:19:56] looked through through our lives we've
[1:19:58] looked down through the last you know
