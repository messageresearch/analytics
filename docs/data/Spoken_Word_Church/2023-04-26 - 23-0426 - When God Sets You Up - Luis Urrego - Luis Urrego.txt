Matthew chapter 15. and we'll start at verse 21. Matthew 15 21. before we go there let's just let's just bow our heads our gracious Lord Jesus we just thank you Father once again for the opportunity to read your word thank you Lord Jesus that this is your Eternal and holy word father and Lord Jesus it's it's father God powerful Lord to even change father God the the most vile person Lord even in this hour it's got power to heal Lord Jesus because father your word is life and so Lord Jesus it's it's it's got creative power Lord and we just thank you for your word this afternoon Lord I pray Lord Jesus that you would forgive us forgive us

father God something that would help them um in their Journey with you Lord Jesus and you use my lips Lord Jesus to speak father God Father for I am unworthy Lord God but you are worthy Lord Jesus and we just commit ourselves into your hands this evening bless those that are not here with us Lord and we just ask that you have your way in this service we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God Matthew chapter 15 starting at verse 21 it says then Jesus went thence and departed into the coast of tire and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen this afternoon I just want to take a little topic and I just want to call it when God sets you up amen when God sets you up how many have been set up before or have you set someone up it's not a good feeling you know we we have uh maybe we have different testimonies or different experiences you know brother Brandon was set up one time when he was when he came there with the ministers there in Chicago and uh they set him up for a trap and um but uh God knew amen what they were doing I remember one time when we first came into the message we were so excited about the message and about the word and and uh when we had come out of the Baptist Church we had some friends there that were very skeptical of why we had left and and so they invited us to their house and they told us they said hey we want us to tell you tell us about this this Prophet about brother Branham and and coming and tell us about the message so my dad and me we went over there and and they were friends of ours there at the Baptist Church we got there we were genuinely thought that they really wanted to hear about the message but when we got there they had they had a man there from one of the Baptist Churches there in Greenville South Carolina and he we were not expecting him to be there he was a he was a creature and so we started talking my dad and me started explaining some things to them what we knew at the time and uh all of a sudden he starts he starts speaking up and say he just kind of took over the whole thing after that um and it was just a surprise for us because really what it was is that they were trying to set us up for a trap because this man was a theologian and so my dad and me we we uh you know we gave him some books we gave him some tracks I remember right before we left their their house that day and we were just downtrodden my dad and me you know because there we were so excited about hey we were going to talk to tell them about the the word of God tell them about the message and here we are they're just telling us how wrong we are and through this man and I remember going to the restroom that afternoon or right before we left their house and uh all the books and the tracks and everything that we had given them where they were already in the trash can there in the restroom so it was it was a trap it was a setup but you know God has this God knows exactly amen who's going to receive his word and who's not amen the only responsibility that we have is just to be a light to people amen and and tell them wait and then your duty bound to answer when someone asks you questions amen your duty bound to and if you don't know how then I'm afraid you need to get in the word then if you if you say well you need to talk to my pastor you need to talk to such and such you need to get in the word yourself if you don't know how to explain the word yourself that's a problem I think if you say you're a Christian especially if you're being a Christian for many years and you don't know how to explain basic salvation to people or how to receive the holy ghost that is a big problem so I I think I think that you need to do something about that but anyways so when God sets us up amen there's we've all been set up at one point in time and and uh uh and but God you know God also sets sets sets us up and it's not it's not to do us any wrong amen but I believe God sets you up Amen in order to bring something out of you amen that wouldn't have come out in the first place in in any other way and so in looking here at this woman at the at this Canaanite at this Canaanite woman here on in Matthew chapter 15 which you can also read in Mark chapter 7 this this account amen it's always been striking to me this this this this this this this this uh this passage here in the scriptures because uh it's a gentile woman it's not a Hebrew she wasn't uh one of his disciples she uh she wasn't uh someone who was walking with Jesus she was a gentile Heathen woman who apparently where she came from she was a Canaanite woman and where she came from she was uh she she was a idol worshiper she she didn't worship the the the the god of Israel she didn't amen but but somehow or another amen it got to a point that her daughter a man was so sick and was so tormented by a devil that she realized wait a second my God the gods that we are told that we to worship the Bales or the or whoever it is cannot help my daughter and she probably may have heard from many different different testimonies of different people of what Jesus had done for for her for others and and she said you know what if he can do it for them then I know that he can do it for me too amen and I'm not going for myself but I'm going for my daughter amen what mother amen doesn't doesn't do anything amen for their child when she's a true mother I mean she would do she would she would Shake heavens and earth just to be able to find help for a sick a sick daughter or a sick son amen there's nothing that you wouldn't do as a parent for for your child oh they might be 35 years old there's still nothing that you wouldn't do for your child that's your child amen you would try to find help you would try to do whatever you could Amen in order to help your children praise the Lord you know I I is there's there's something that that struck me when I was younger uh I when I used to work at Chick-fil-A in in Greenville South Carolina and there was one evening while parents used to go go pick me up it would be about a 35 minute drive from where we lived to the Chick-fil-A where I was working at and she and they'd pick me up well that evening somehow there was no cell phones at the time so I got so we lost communication I left earlier that that evening and so I I I what I thought that they were going to be already out there waiting for me and and and so what it was at the parking lot the Chick-fil-A was at a parking lot of it was at a mall and so I walked out the parking lot and I was there just walking around I was listening to my music and just kind of walking around and and and my parents were driving around too and they were looking looking for me wondering when I was gonna get out but it was about an hour or so and my mom thought because my mom wasn't with my dad dad even my mom thought that something had happened to me because the Chick-fil-A had already closed so that so the parking lot was getting dark and and uh and so finally I saw them and got in the car and and my mom was worried half to death and that's what we do sometimes as as kids we worry our parents I know I did they pray if it wasn't for their prayers we wouldn't be where we are now amen thank God for our parents prayers but we got home and the love of a mother you know I'll never forget this when we got home we got out of the car and we walked in the house and she opened the door when we walked in together she really wasn't saying anything while we're in the car because she was she was nervous but when we got in the car when we got in the house she turned around looked at me and just gave me this big old tight hug as you started crying on my on my on my shoulders and said I thought I'd lost I thought something was had happened to you and right there I I just I just I I melted to [Laughter] I said Mom I'm okay I was probably like 15 years old Mom I'm okay I'm okay I'm her only son so and her firstborn so but but you know those things leave an impression in your heart it lets you know that your parents you know really love you and uh show them affection when they show you affection because maybe you won't ever have that opportunity again you know you might you might think oh my parent my dad or my mom they're they're just too affectionate I don't want them to go over here and get so close to me but you know what there's you're our children you'll never stop being our children no matter how grown up you might be you're still gonna always be our children and we saw you from a little baby and then here you are you're grown up and you're bigger and we still love you just the same so anyways I don't even know why I got into that that wasn't even in my notes but praise the Lord anyhow amen brother Branham says this here he says in the message in thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy he says you go through a test God tests you like he did Abraham he tests Abraham's seed after him and now the reason we don't possess the Gate of the enemy the reason there's so much Among Us is because that we're not able to stand the test and let me tell you something watch what he says here and I thought this was very interesting the test of the word is right amen the test of the word is right you know God Amen when he tests his children amen is through his word amen is how you will respond maybe to Something in the word that maybe he's already spoken to you already but you haven't done anything about it so then he'll bring something about in your life amen there's like you know what you know my word already let's see if you can if you can pass that amen and if you don't pass it you just take it over again until you do pass it amen until you go to the next grade and that's how God works amen so the test of the word is right and so we're going to see here in just a moment how he used his own his word amen in order to to test this this this woman I mean she wasn't a a a daughter of his uh per se but maybe later on she got the Holy Ghost I don't know we don't know after what happened here but one thing is for certain amen we see that something great happened here something something something uh was was brought out of her amen that would not have been brought out any other way and it took a devil Amen to drive her to do that it took a devil amen possessing her her daughter Amen to drop to to put her into that situation in order to bring that situation about and don't you think that God remember Jesus said that he never did anything unless the father showed him first and so we see that here in Matthew chapter 15 amen at the first at the beginning of the chapter the first uh the first part of the chapter he's Jesus is offending left and right he's he's talking about uh the talking about the traditions of uh of God versus the the Commandments of God and how the Pharisees they were just about amen looking good on the outside amen but they were dead men bones inside and how they're dead in their traditions and and he was just offending them left and right and then here he here he comes Amen in this same chapter and is about to bring more offense amen but it's not an offense Amen to do harm but it's an offense to do good amen because he saw I believe that he saw this woman otherwise he wouldn't go to Tire and sidon for one for one I I I I believe that he's trying to get away from the heat there in in in in in Jerusalem or wherever he was talking to the Pharisees it was probably a lot of heat he made him mad so he's probably trying to get away and if you know where tire and siding is located it's located uh on the uh North uh West part of of of of Israel towards the coasts and uh so it's very very far from from from Jerusalem and in those areas and tire inside and are about our cities are about 20 miles away from each other they were Heathen cities they they served other gods and and they they were mostly made up of gentiles amen and there were some Jews there too but Jesus amen went over there to get away from all that heat you know sometimes we need to get away from the Heat it's good to get away you know they were to criticize brother Brandon sometimes while he'd go fishing and shouldn't he always be preaching shouldn't he always be praying for the sick healing to say but you know what you need some rest sometimes you know you a Ministry can wear you out Ministry can wear you out and and preaching can wear you out too and uh so Jesus needed rest along with his disciples now we we know that God has pleased in testing his children we see it we read in First Peter chapter one verse verse 7 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold amen he calls the trial of your faith precious than gold amen that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ job 23 10 tells us yet he knows the way I have taken when he has tested me I will come forth as gold Psalm 66 10 tells us for thou God has proved us thou has tried us as silver is tried amen and then first Peter 4 12 tells us beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you trials will come tests will come there are unavoidable is how you will react to those tests and how will you react to those trials is is what is is how is what God is trying to bring out of us amen so there in Matthew 15 21 we'll just kind of take it verse 5 verse and it says then Jesus went dancing departed it to the coast of tire and sidon and we we are we read we already went through that Jesus had just amen he had he had a Throwdown I guess you could say with the with the with the Pharisees there at the beginning of the chapter amen but you know what truth is truth amen and and and and and and and and you know Jesus needed Jesus was only here for a certain amount of time so he needed to tell him the truth amen and it was up to them to do what they were going to do with that truth now in verse 22 it says and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David amen it's almost as if she's saying if she's saying that she's the one that needs the help she Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David amen obviously she's been around Jews so you know enough to know that the Messiah that was to come was to be the son of David it was a political term that really didn't belong for her to her for for her to say Amen so really she wasn't son of David to him because the son of David was only for the Jews amen and so she she calls out to him and says with with with everything that she has I'm sure she was being she was being genuine in the way she was doing it and she says Lord have mercy on me thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil now the Bible doesn't tell us amen how vexed she was maybe she was it was sickness maybe it was a a demon of of something spiritual in her life we don't know but the Bible tells us that she says to him she was grievously vexed with a devil and you know as I said you know the the the the the her her denomination couldn't help her her church people her pastor couldn't help her amen this was the last opportunity this was the last person amen that she she's she's helped others why couldn't he help me and so she goes with to him as with everything that she has amen praise God now verse 23 tells us but he answered her not a word so here's this woman amen she's making all this F all this racket and all this noise and you know Jesus has to have hurt her but the Bible tells us that he answered her not a word amen maybe Jesus and the disciples amen they were really they were really relaxing they were really you know we've had we've had we've had enough uh heat for for a little while and and and maybe Jesus was on his phone you know like some of us sometimes you know hey brother how you doing huh [Laughter] you're taught you have to talk over people now amen you gotta snatch the phone off off of people just to get them to pay attention to you nowadays I've I've been there done that I got the T-shirt my wife could tell you that that's the case but here it's rude when somebody doesn't pay attention to you or doesn't doesn't hear you out right and here's this woman amen when it comes to Jesus with a need and the Bible says that he then answer her not one word I mean we get offended nowadays amen when people when you know that they read our text message because it says red at the bottom and they don't reply back you imagine that the god of creation amen the the Jesus amen who whose the loving Christ Jesus who's supposed to pay attention to to every one of our needs didn't reply back to her didn't reply her text message in other words in today's vernacular can you imagine that and his disciples came and besought him saying verse 23 and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us now and looking at some and reading at some of this we don't know there's there's we don't know if the disciples were telling her go ahead and give her what she wants and let her just go on her way telling Jesus or Jesus go ahead and just tell her to go away right because they knew that Jesus could do what could give her what she needed but obviously she was being very bothersome to them and so much that amen they were probably on their phones too I don't know I mean they were probably they were probably they were probably just just busy and and and and like you know what get her to go away do something Jesus in other words they were trying to tell Jesus what to do amen and Jesus was just there minding his own business amen so here's the thing the woman that woman was re was ignored first she comes with a need and how is it you know when we when we come with a need amen and and we're and we're ignored amen she comes with a need and is ignored by not just Jesus but by the church as well the disciples ignore her as well they don't even give her any help amen and so now amen she feels rejected as well praise the Lord send her away for she crieth after us and it wasn't that they were she was crying for them because she wasn't saying she wasn't telling that Peter have mercy on me or anything like that no she was one in Jesus but they were getting in the way of her getting to Jesus I wonder if sometimes us amen as the Disciples of Christ as the Church of Christ if we don't get in the way of people getting closer to God amen maybe we're the ones that fault amen for people not drawing closer to us because we think amen that our way the way we do it is is how we it needs to be done and you know what sometimes that might just turn people more away then draw them closer it's better amen to just just say Lord have your way Lord do what you need to do amen and you know the hearts of people because you and me cannot do the work for others I can't change Hearts but the weight can't change Hearts brother said brother Dell can't change Hearts none of us can change people's hearts only God changes hearts hey man only God a man can change the heart there is nothing that you and I can say Amen to some rebellious rebellious youth or some rebellious person or or anybody amen that would change their heart unless God comes down and does it himself hey man I'm just thoroughly convinced of that more and more as the year passes by and as you see our our children growing amen there is nothing that you and I can say Amen that really will turn hearts unless they really want to desire it first other than that amen it's just just you just wasting your breath it really God has not gone in there now you can be salty you'd be salted before people because I promise you that living the life amen and and and living before others amen has more impact than anything that you and I could say amen anything that you and me could say amen any anything that you and me can can prove to someone amen doesn't have as much impact as when somebody amen sees a life a genuine uh life amen being reflected out of out of you I pray God helped us amen pray God helps us so the disciples amen they take the matters into their own hands and and they try to tell Jesus what to do and and and so what what was what was the real reason that the disciples wanted Jesus to send her away was it because they wanted her to be healed or was it because they were she was being just a bother like a little like a little puppy a little dog a little barking Chihuahua hey man just barking right around here I don't know if you ever had a barking Chihuahua maybe you have one of those at your house we used to have a Chihuahua when we were younger and then things oh man they they're bothersome yeah yeah they're cute some of them but then they they have that that that bothersome bark it gets on your nerves and so much that you just want to stick them in a closet and shut the door and just not let them ever come out again but they'll keep they'll watch over a house though they'll let you know if somebody's approaching the house amen but that's how these these disciples saw that this woman and verse 24 it says but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel now this is after Jesus after the disciples had told them send her away and this is his reply Jesus replied but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel so was Jesus answering the disciples or was he saying it to the woman because he doesn't it doesn't say whether he was talking to the woman or was he answering his disciples you see now later on we'll know we'll see that he actually directly talks to the woman amen but I believe that Jesus when he was saying this amen he was saying that with with with tenderness and compassion amen but yet stating truth amen because let's just read it like this sometimes we want to read this these passages and and and think that Jesus was just being so hard and and and and and just kind of just kind of you know going over this woman you are a dog and but I don't think Jesus because Jesus because the woman was was still persistent and you're not going to persist amen with someone who who doesn't want you you know you just kind of leave him alone then but I believe that that that the way Jesus was talking amen wasn't being harsh wasn't being wasn't being a uh critical hey man wasn't being amen but I believe Jesus amen let's just see it like this he said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel in other words I'm I'm I got I got to do this you know it's almost like I'm being torn apart you know this is just me I could be wrong but the loving Jesus amen had to find a certain way Amen to bring that out of her amen praise God and it caused amen it caused the woman to be persistent amen however it was that the Lord Jesus amen was answering her it caused her to be persistent amen because she kept persisting praise God and so we see here amen that brother Branham the quote that we just read that he says the test of the word is Right amen praise God what Jesus was doing amen was the right thing what Jesus was saying to her was the right thing because the Bible says that he came to his own right and his own received him not he came as the Messiah for the Jews amen he was fulfilling amen the Old Testament scriptures amen and so he really wasn't for them but was it that the Gentiles were not going to receive any benefits while he was there Sunday and and if you look back amen he replies this way but if you go back to Matthew chapter eight just a few chapters before we see the Roman Centurion and he was a gentile and he goes to Jesus almost in the same way and he says Lord uh he says uh uh uh my my servant is grievously sick and you know what Jesus replies to him he says I'll go and heal him why didn't he answer her this way but then what what the Centurion says he says uh Lord I'm not worthy that you come under my roof amen because you're you're you're you're you're a master just like I am and if you and and I tell this one to do this and this one to go that and but if you just say the word it was almost it's almost as if Jesus amen said deliberately those things or did deliberately those things in order to bring that out of them the Roman Centurion and it's the same thing with the Canaanite woman here that we're reading about makes me think about predestination brother Ryan talking about bro this the uh Sunday it really enjoyed that that that uh Sunday school lesson about how God has a plan for us and it's like a it's like a play in the different characters and and all this and and God's foreknowledge amen he knows amen what you are going to choose amen praise God so he'll present the situation in order for you to make the decision to make the choice now maybe the Centurion he heard the same thing too he probably heard that others were being healed as well so why couldn't his servant be healed amen and maybe he see they had to hear something first in order for them to make a decision to go to Jesus and then Jesus present things Amen to them the way they're the the way they did so Jesus to the Romans and church says I'll go and heal him oh no no Lord no you stay right there you just say the word amen and my servant will be healed that was powerful Jesus told him he said amen I haven't seen such faith in Israel amen and his servant was healed why is why it say do the same thing for this woman she was a gentile just like he was he was she was a heathen just like the Roman Centurion was nothing different other than he was a man and she this is a woman but you see God knows exactly how to deal with each and every one of us he knows exactly what you need or what he needs to say Amen through his word or maybe through a sermon or or maybe somebody says something to you to bring a certain reaction amen that will spark amen for you too too to to decide going this way or decide going that way Amen in order to fulfill your predestination amen that's how I believe it I believe that that's what happened here because God's not respect your persons he just knows exactly what you need you see praise God sometimes hey man we're so stuck in in and it needs to be done this way this way God only does it this way God you'll be surprised God sometimes amen does things totally different than what we think and you can't say that that is not of God if it's going to bring out a positive outcome amen then so be it he'll always stay in his word for sure and neither of these two situations he was out of the word he just knows the hearts of the people much better than you and me do you don't know people's hearts I don't know people's hearts therefore we can't judge amen and say yes yes yes yes yes when in reality you don't know amen so we got to be careful with that we got to be careful with that amen so in John 1 11 says he came to his own and his own received him not amen so Jesus was there fulfilling amen that that that that scripture amen and and then going back to what brother Ryan was saying amen because um I like the way he brought it out with regards to to you know uh the different characters and a play and and all those different things different elements have to take place in our life amen we in our life this woman right here amen God Jesus was trying to do everything he could because he only had a certain amount of time with her so he did everything amen that he could Amen to draw out what he knew was in her amen all in maybe in a 30-minute span what might take place for us in 80 years the ups and downs where we don't where we where we pray to God and say Lord do this for me and God doesn't answer and then sometimes we have our our our our ups and and we have their good times and and all that that woman experienced that in within a span of maybe 30 minutes God wasn't going to waste Jesus wasn't there waste any time amen he was going to bring out from her amen exactly what she he needed to bring out so it could take for us 75 years to do it it could take fit amen God is patient but for in this situation he needed to do it within 20 to 30 minutes that's the reason why he because you read this passage and you think how harsh Jesus was what situation why couldn't he just go and and just heal his daughter or or remotely do it he did it for the Roman Centurion why can't amen but he was he was the pro the healing part was not the his problem he could do that that is not a problem he was trying to bring out out of this woman amen something that he knew that he that she could come to him he was more concerned about her than he was about the healing of the daughter amen that's how strange God does things he's more concerned about the heart than he is about amen the healing of a person I'm not saying that that that that the healing is not important to him I'm just saying the heart is more important amen because you could be healed in your body and then maybe backslide a year from now and be totally healed from cancer God will never take that away he could amen he could but he's more concerned about your heart condition about your soul praise the Lord so healing of our bodies amen that's just that's just that's just a little bit sometimes it's the hearts that he has he has to work on more amen but he does it right that's exactly what he needs to do amen so in verse 25 it tells us then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me amen and and after being rejected after being ignored she finally said you know what he's not my Messiah he's not he's not I'm he's not by son of David I realized that but at least I'm going to plead for his mercy and for his grace that's all I got amen praise the Lord Jesus silence amen towards her and and what seemed to be a rejection brought out authenticity from her now she was now she she came in talking about son of David have mercy on me she wouldn't be an authentic then she was just doing what what others were doing she was just saying what others was saying now she said Lord I have no other place to go I have no other person to turn to Lord help me brought out something authentic from her brought out humility out of her amen brought up perseverance in her amen amen in a Heart of Worship too now she's got a Heart of Worship praise the Lord amen and Matthew Matthew and the next verse he says but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs amen now let's just look at this here for just a moment I'm just kind of skipping here a few things because what Jesus was doing amen he was setting her up remember the title is when God sets you up he was setting her up the whole time amen he was setting her up for for a breakthrough praise God that's really what he was doing amen and sometimes our in our problems amen God is all he's doing is just setting you up he's just setting you up he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs now according to Mark 7 24 which is the other scripture that's talking about the same situation Jesus at this time was in a house and it reads like this and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tire and sidon and entered into an house and would not and would and would have no man know it but he could not be hid so the woman probably entered into the house maybe she was outside crying for him and the disciples said tell her to go away at this time now he's entering into an house maybe he was there to pray for somebody or or to heal somebody or maybe just to have dinner we don't know why he was there at the house for but she won't leave him alone and then in verse 27 because we know that Jesus actually uh says this line to her but Jesus said unto her amen that same line that we just read there in verse 26. let their children first be filled for it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs now if you look at the Greek word because sometimes we wonder what's Jesus really calling her a dog maybe maybe not but if you look at the Greek there amen Jesus the the is the word the Greek word there is and that and that word means a little dog a house dog or a puppy it's totally different from the word dogs that are used in Matthew chapter 7 verse 6. which is which says give not that which is holy unto the dogs that's a totally different word there is the word kissing it's the Greek word kisim which is a dog which is universally despised in the East a primary word or a dog in Luke 16 21 speaking of Lazarus the beggar having his Source licked by dogs that is a totally different word there as well which means which means the same thing as the previous one a dog universally despised in the East or a dog but the word that Jesus uses there or the translation is a puppy or a house dog so he wasn't calling her a dog from the street a dog from the street doesn't have any uh uh uh uh benefits but your dog at your house you will he has benefits he might be a dog but he's got benefits or she's got benefits he wasn't calling her a dog as an offense per se and while he was really telling her is like hold on a second let me take care of the children first then you can be taken care of and we'll read here that in just a moment amen because Jesus really wasn't refusing her request is not what he was doing he was just prioritizing her request is really what he was doing so we have this dog at our house her name is Satsuki and I have a picture here man you want to see a picture of our dog maybe the brothers could bring can bring that up anyways I need to connect here anyways that Satsuki right there that was a picture that my wife took last night and she's a Maltipoo now this is the position that she's always at when I get home from work especially when she sees me going through she knows that I'm going to be giving her some something to eat she's looking at me just like that and jumping and then eventually she'll start jumping and stuff like that but what Jesus is telling this woman is that you you maybe you're a house dog right but a house dog with benefits because as the people are eating and stuff like that maybe I I don't know I'll do it I'm not supposed to my wife gets on to me to do it as I'm eating amen sometimes I'll give her a little something or or or or as maybe the the the the the kids at the house sometimes if they if they're like finish your food and they don't finish it all so that eventually gets gone wow they had given her the last few scraps she is eating exactly what we're eating at the time that we're eating so what this woman is is about to tell her the brothers can cut that off for just a moment bring my notes back here what Jesus is trying to tell them is is tell her is hold on a second amen the children come first then you can then you can have your benefits amen I'm not ignoring you amen he clearly tells her I'm not ignoring you you you but they come first amen it's almost like the the the equivalent of like uh you know when you go to the to the let's say you you broke your ankle or or or you sprung your ankle and you go to the emergency room amen and then you're there at the emergency room but as you're they're being treated and they're looking at your ankle and then but then here comes a man a man who's been shot or gunshot wounded and it's bleeding all over the place inside the same inside the same uh uh emergency room and and everybody amen stops doing what they're doing to you amen because they got to attend to this man yeah you ain't gonna get mad you ain't going you ain't gonna be like well I ain't coming here anymore and you just hobble out right out of the hospital they gonna take care of them he's bleeding blood coming out of his mouth and all kinds of stuff and you're worried about a sprung that's exactly what Jesus is doing with this woman hold on a second wage return amen but the woman wasn't gonna have it she understood amen she understood because I mean she could have left mad right there she could have left sad she could have left right there in the day but you're not gonna help me well I'm gone and I will make sure that I post it all over Facebook and let everybody know who you really are Jesus and Peter and and and and all the disciples I'll tell them who you really are you really don't want to help you're you're racist I'm pulling out the race card like everybody else does nowadays all right let me get off that but this is this is she could have done it but she didn't he called me a house dog he called me a dog but you know what she she started thinking with herself amen she probably started thinking wait a second he called me a house dog and he called me a dog he called me a house dog and being that I have a house dog I have a dog in my house myself I can enjoy what the master is eating maybe she thought that within herself at the moment and she says in verse 27 she says truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table in other words as the master is eating the dogs can also enjoy at the same time so what she's trying to tell him is Lord as you're there dealing with with your children I can enjoy those benefits too at the same time amen well look what look in in Mark 7 28 says it says it like this and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and when you look at that word crumbs it could also mean morsels amen so whatever the the the the the master is eating whatever their children are eating I can enjoy too even if it's in small portions but it's the same food amen it's the same food praise the Lord Jesus amen and she agreed with Jesus she told them you're right Lord you're right amen she said the right thing you are right Lord but yet even though I may be a dog maybe a house dog or whatever it is that you're calling me amen but I can have the same benefits that they are having praise God amen don't you think that you can enjoy the same benefits well somebody else got healed somebody else family a child came to the came to the Lord somebody else amen received this benefit in their life spiritual life I don't know about me amen but if you just take the attitude of this woman amen that amen they can have it I can too because God is not a respecter of persons amen praise the Lord the way they came amen is the way that I can come praise God her faith was already built so much amen even through rejection through through being ignored even through all these different things amen even being insulted almost and yet all that did was just raise her faith up even more praise God that's hard but I believe that if Jesus amen it maybe if Jesus was was being harsh towards her like we think maybe he was maybe she might not have replied that way because who who will who will come to you we'll draw closer to you when you're harsh to them it doesn't work that way but I believe in assault in in a softer way wait a second let me take care of that then the dog because maybe Jesus was telling her that in the in a way of like let's say let's say we say uh uh you know the Golden Rule you know some sort of quote you know uh you know treat others as you want to be treated right maybe he's just kind of telling her that it's not it's not right for me to to to to to deal with you right now when there's a need here but I will deal with you oh it's okay Lord but even while you're dealing with them I'll have my portion as well praise God because hiding trouble I didn't come all over here all this way amen just to not just to leave empty-handed amen I could receive a blessing too right man I didn't I didn't I didn't walk all this way I didn't go through all this I didn't go through every church and every preacher from our church to pray for my daughter and I went through many doctors maybe she went through a whole lot of stuff just to get the healing for her daughter and you're my last chance Lord you're my last resort and I know that you are right Lord but even in this condition amen I can receive benefits praise God amen look what brother Branham says in the message perseverance now this woman the seraphenician woman she believed also this Greek she said Lord first she said thou son of David a gentile has no hold on Christ by the son of David that was thought King that was through King David the race of the Jews he never paid any attention to her but when she turned and said Lord help me amen that got him he was her Lord not a son of David but he was her Lord Lord help me that caught him and he turned around and said it's true the dogs eat the scraps from the master's table that is true look what that woman had the right approach to God's gift what did she say he said he said she approached it right amen she approached it right I like the way Jesus says it in in I believe it's in the Living Translation in verse 28 she said she replied that's true Lord but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children's plates and then and then what in verse 29 he says good answer he said good answer now go home for the demon has left your daughter amen he finally tells her what she wanted to hear the whole time after she after he got from her what he wanted out of her amen amen praise the Lord maybe you're you're seeking the the Healer in your life for what for for your healing I don't know but really what you need maybe you're seeking the healing in in your life but what you really need is the Healer yeah amen maybe what you're you're seeking a miracle in your life but what you really need is the miracle maker amen maybe what what you need is is him personally amen and and not necessarily the the the benefit of him and when the woman got to that point that she was seeking the the the him more than the benefit then Jesus could do something for her brother he didn't even he wasn't even seeing her daughter she probably he probably didn't even know what he she looked like he probably had never seen her before maybe in his mind he did the Bible doesn't say but he had never even talked to her and yet when he received that response and that faith and that that that that that increased in her amen go your daughter is made well praise God amen good answer amen praise the Lord amen so she so she received amen exactly what she needed to hear that the brothers could could bring uh the the screen up one more time hmm I hope this plays all right there we go so right there she was ignored right she still kept going then she she was rejected right she still kept going all right come on bro send her away not even paying attention then she was considered insignificant but she's still climbing then she was insulted but if you notice a man that as as as all these roadblocks are being put in front of her amen that all it is is just scaling her up for for her they're just stepping stones for for her miracle amen there's the miracle and there's the blessing right there and Jesus was was setting her up the whole time praise the Lord so you're you're you're you're you're your nose amen the nose are the best yeses that that God will that you'll ever receive amen amen sometimes we ask the Lord God do this amen and he says no and I know that that was kind of a little cheesy but I was I was actually working with a little program that you know you know what let me let me try this and it worked [Laughter] praise God so God is setting you up I mean it could maybe for this woman it was a it was an ordeal about maybe 15 to 30 minutes I don't know we don't know how long that that that whole ordeal took place for you it could be five years for you could be 10 years 15 years 30 years I don't know you don't know but God ultimately wants hearts not just the Miracles the Miracles are fine but he ultimately wants hearts maybe maybe he's doing the things he's doing in your life because he wants your heart he wants your heart first he wants to do a work in you first then after he's done with you then he can do the rest because that part is easy amen amen amen so I just thank God Amen for for that praise the Lord Jesus amen right before we leave I wanted to if the brothers made sure make sure that they have audio I wanted to save this last I wanted to First say to thank thank each and every uh my my wife's oldest uh sister from Canada she she had surgery Nova is her name she had surgery earlier this week her thyroid was

love the Lord let's stand to our feet with him amen when God sets you up amen do you believe that God can set you up for a blessing maybe God is doing it right now I don't understand Lord amen we
