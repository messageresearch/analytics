I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the endings says the Lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty Hebrews 13 8 right I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patents for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet remember not a not a trumpet but a voice with a great statement to be made what saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seeest writing a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto somernia unto and unto pergamus and into Sardis enter to Philadelphia and under Lady of Sia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle you may be seated the Lord have it his Blessing to the reading of the word now to try to continue our thought s of preparation for talking on the Sevenfold Glory of his person um just to back up just a little bit on this morning's message and to think about it that you know we were talking about the voice that is heard dire and you know we we know that God has a voice his voice is his word Okay then if anybody takes that word takes that word upon their lips and God reveals in their heart what is being said then the prophet said deity is speaking but see we don't want to go that way we're scared of that because we think you're going to go a little bit too far you know and get out on the wrong limb well which is the way to be get out on the limb or not even ever start up the tree you know I mean at least you're doing something and you know and just we think about it and think about the the voice of God speaking to us because I believe that's why that it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I believe God spoke to us by using man's lips to bring a message unto you and I all right straight from his hand To Us by way of the Prophet messenger all right and then see he's not here in a physical form you know God in a physical form or a bodily form he's now in his bride all right that is his last uh form right to the Gentiles the last in morphe the word it's the life form that he is to take to the Gentiles is the word made flesh in a group of people all right it first started by the prophet bringing the word but then someone must become that as I've always said about Martin Luther oh the Catholic Church didn't get very upset with him when he began to talk about the Jewish shall live by faith you know I mean they didn't like it but and they thought well you know we're losing one of our great guys that we've trained but when the people begin to walk in what the messenger brought see then is when the trouble came because they saw they was losing people all right now I've always believed that this message is supposed to be made alive all right now because the prophet brought it It Was Made Alive in his life all right we agree with that we believe that it was made alive in his day and and things and that was true but the message must live right it was made to be lived it was brought to be lived it was not just something that we well okay you know maybe we can or may no no you say well I just don't see it well then what are you looking for right I've tried to explain things and found wound up I guess making it a deeper I don't mean to deeper understand I'm making it deeper to be not understood by trying to explain it because you try to explain to people what you see a lot of times and you confuse them that much more because their mind is not thinking the way your mind is thinking and thereby it becomes confusion but I'll still keep right on doing the best I can trying to explain it and what I mean by explaining it you know I'm not talking about the way maybe you're talking I'm talking about things like you know uh people say I just don't see no uh no move of God you know I don't see things happening like it did in the book of Acts you know well I've always said it and I know that that when I say it people but you've changed places with us in the book of Acts people and I'd like to see what they would be doing I don't mean that derogatory I mean it from a heart of sincerity and love to try to express something to people that you bring those Apostles over here and put them here for about six months under the situation we live under I said just live under today in the hour of the spirits the pool to do into things and let them stay here about six months they'd probably say well let's be let's walk back you know because you know they didn't face a bunch of things like we do you know we're kind of like Paul was in his description you know of his doings that he was beat this he was thrown in this he was in the uh you know the sea he's done all the things you know all for the word of God well you know what he didn't have no problems with that he was happy and I'm happy to be here I am I'm really thrilled to be here in the end time where these things are taking place that may mean death to a lot of us but that's where people don't believe that see they don't think it's going to wind up well that's all right I'm not one to say that it will but I'm saying that you know uh what if it does I'd rather be prepared to know a little bit about it I'd rather have a couple of extra cans of green beans sitting in my house than to be like everybody don't just live by faith It really used to come by the house all the time like that you know just live by faith and yeah he liked to live off of our food and his faith a little dirty I guess but that's the way a lot of people want to do I remember brother Tatum or brother Moke telling about his brother coming through one time you're way back preaching you know live by faith no don't you know just live by faith and on Monday he come around upon his guitar to be able to you know move on well that's all right what if you're going to live by faith just go live if that's the way you're going to be uh I was reading what somebody sent me a little thing about you know and they said you know about a job being eight to twelve hours a day but their final statement was in other words if I do that I can't have the ministry well I don't see why you can't I preach eight and ten hour I mean worked eight and ten hours a day for many many years and preach three services a week you know I didn't have around no problems you know because that's but that's what we we think we're supposed to be The Minister's not supposed to work you know now if you can find me that in the Bible I'll be able to choke it down and eat it but I'm not worried about eating it because you're not going to find it right all right see that's uh the Lord Jesus worked until he got so far along into Ministry and uh you know Paul he worked until he got so far and you know then he's got where he couldn't work because he would just need well that's fine when you get where you could when it takes care of things amen you know but just move on but I'm trying to just say the point of that we get a concept about things and it's hard to get people to break away from that thought or that idea or concept that they have of what things are supposed to be you know all right but now let's get down to what we're talking about because we saw this morning and getting into it that the entire book is the revelation of Jesus Christ all right not just the Book of Revelations but that the Book of Revelation is a wonderful I wrote a very marvelous a point to consider that the fact of knowing that the Bible was written of God by his own hand but then when he would come to the Book of Revelations he would not just come down to and you know and do and right through the apostles and things but he would have purse would personally appear to John to write that's what we were talking about this morning when we're reading it we wrote around him says this is not a prophet here in Revelations 1. he said this is God all right well then I settled I don't care what you want to try to describe and do they say that it's forget it it's God right because that's what the prophet said it was all right now in doing that then we see that the the other writings of the Bible that's trying to express this morning I want to get that talk make sure you keep it the other writings yes it was God's finger that wrote it but the Book of Revelations was not his finger to write but he was personally appearing to a scribe to make sure I'm quoting brother Branham to make sure it was right he appears himself not even a prophet to ride it in the basis of a prophet to just get it like Paul and the different ones he comes himself personally two you know John to write all right now in doing that then he's putting his seal of approval upon it in his very first writings about it you know I used to I've told you this before but I always I always love to read but when his kids we didn't have much to read and all but I I always did hate to read books it was just so dull until it was just you know it was just they just signed a book we had to read it well that wasn't too bad because you could lie about where you read it or not you know right but then didn't want you to make a book report you remember that kids probably don't have to do those things now you know you got to make a book report well I hated it because I knew how dull the story was going to be so I'd read the little introduction at the front I'd get the characters and I'd get John and Mary and Susie and Joe and and I get them all you know find it out and then I would write my own book knowing the teacher 99 of the time never read the book or south because I got by all right I've done pretty good my sister loved her to do reports like that so sometimes I'd get her to do it I've done pretty good until I forgot one day to copy what she wrote me and turned her writing in and they got me but you know but my point is in writing in writing is a wonderful thing you know I love to read stories that have that will keep you interested you know the right real true writers will keep you you know tied with it Spellbound as we call uh on the writing well to me that's what the Book of Revelations is it's spellbinding to the human mind once you see who the characters are and you realize that hey this is talking about me this is what God 2 000 years ago wrote down that I would be or this somebody would be it and why can't I believe I'm that person why can't I believe it especially when it begins to unfold unto me amen you know to be part of me I get excited you know about it and then I want to turn over real quick to the back of the book don't you I want to know about John and Mary if they live happily ever after you know I want to get to the more into the story but then I realized the way the Bible is reading written that we must go step at a time because that's the way God reveals it all right it's a very marvelous thing to look at the Book of Revelations and to be able to find yourself written therein all right Jesus appearing personally to a scribe to write and not letting even a prophet write it it came himself that's wonderful all right see he wants us to know who he is and I wrote sure s-u-r-e in other words make sure you understand then he wants us to see who we are and by that we will see where he is all right now I made a statement this morning that maybe some of you younger ones may not really think about too much but you know what that once this once God unites with his people in some way somewhere one of these days if not already it's going to be that you're not going to be able to find God unless you find the people now I believe that you said well God can just drop down yeah but that's not exactly the way he chooses and you know what if he chooses it to be that way you know what that's the way it's going to be if he chooses it to be that the people is to describe it or bring it out then that's the way it's going to be show me in the book of Acts where anybody's out over here without a Bible without any form without anything so we'll be in the Bible anywhere somebody off by their self and God just drops down and speaks to them and they get up and run over here and no no now come on I said with the Bible or some form right right he's always got a contractor goes I the way I understand the Bible and the description the prophet gave is that the word comes through the body and see then if the word comes through the body you're not going to get it outside the body when I got this or I got that that's all right amen what would you get it all right all right well I got to have a book oh you just trapped your own you read what somebody said You Heard a Voice that was speaking through the writing of someone because the the seed comes through the body right all right see then in that way we know what God is trying to do he's trying to get us to come to a realization of the hour that we're living and what it means and what's happened Among Us you know to see that we as I said can sit down and read the Bible where it used to be so confusing don't you remember when you first read it well you had a guard up in heaven and one over the ocean and one Over Yonder and you just had God's running every which way and you couldn't figure out what everything was and then you got into what does that mean like I said my brother-in-law was a Baptist preacher that Beast to him was a great big thing raised up out of the ocean and King Kong I said nothing deceiving about that but to him that yeah all right see God was happy listen in him throughout the fullness of the God had bottled him God was pleased to come down and dwell in that man that we talk about and call his name Jesus all right you know by his giving of his life and the new birth God is happy to come down and dwell in you and I right happy to do because it's fulfilling what he always wanted all right but when it comes down to the final age that we're living in in this final age he leaves no loopholes because he comes down and shows himself in the midst of the seven Church ages like unto the son of man now we've got to cut something right here slice it and lay it in order in the scriptures or we will begin to get out of order with it and not realize it now John was taken to Patmos to show him to write right all right now where was the church when John was writing a lot of it hadn't even come into being yet right as a matter of fact 1895-96 would have just been partially over into the first church age because it started about 53 A.D all right my point we've got to first see ourselves on Earth he said no no no we we need to see ourselves in heaven well how did you get there question number one I don't remember if we come back to earth and see where he's at now on Earth then we can look into the heavenlies and see the 10 15 years ago matching pieces series that I tried to bring because just trying to show it then on one point what that when on Earth we match what is in God's mind of what is to be then we'll go there all right but we must see first here so let's don't go into the heavenly's too far okay I know I require for you to stop and think with me and that's what I want you to do so when you stay down here on Earth all right what was that old thing about the two Earthly minded be it in Heavenly good and Heavenly minded being in Earthly good yeah uh think about it John was seeing what would take place upon the Earth will you go with me John was seeing that even though he was taking up the into the Lord's Day but still there's no need of being in the Lord's day if you don't know how you got there is that carnal enough you know blood enough let's find out how to get there then we can Rejoice because we're going to be rejoicing about what we've done on Earth which that's what everybody wants to do they just want to run along in one of these days don't vacuum go and while we're up in heaven we're just happy and we're just everything so wonderful no I believe those down through the Dark Ages that faced blinds and died in the arenas I think maybe they might have they might understand all right so John is seeing first if he's to write what he sees he's to write it and send it to the seven Church Ages which would be on earth you go with me all right then if he's going to send it to the Earth now you can pick up a little bit and understand why that you would be speaking of the bride of Christ being the son of man you jump up in the heaven real quick look what you've left out you know yeah but but brother day are we you're talking like it's required that we uh understand what's going on well what else is it to be you know I mean you got a ticket in your hand wait on a bus to pull up to take you to heaven and somebody's going to flip a switch no when when when what is on Earth matches what is already shown to be in heaven we go there Now isn't that a marvelous thing to be able to sit here and read of what you and I are going to be before we leave here and not to make it as some form of oh it's going to be I could just see it we're just going we're just going to take over and we're just going to rule the world well that won't fit too much you know that Spirit won't work too good at all you know that's that's not God all right but to say that we are the if we were covering this morning we are the final voice uh the voice and the person is the same as we were trying to cover and like unto the son of man in other words just exactly like him because it's the same God just in a different body this time he's in a member many membered body whereas once he was walking in one body now he's in the bride around the world fulfilling his word and bringing to pass the things as the people begin to eat the word and become the word I just don't see nothing going on well all right at least you're honest might not be too much of good but honestly but as I said to start with what would happen if you changed positions I mean you don't you don't get that I'm sure in my mind this goes crazy in these things I'm sorry but I think about it you notice your lord Jesus faced uh Pharisees Sadducees and herodians that was basically the three groups you got in some more little flings ends and the thing but basically you'd still wouldn't have one handful and we face 969 is what the prophet was calling it plus about 2 000 in the message and that's probably a small number of demons that we face all right we preach these like I love to do it and decide you remember that under Eichmann and Hitler and Mussolini and all that Spirit was loosed on the Jews to drive them to the Homeland right and brother random was talking there in 16 24 right along in that on that message and he said 20 years later which if you put it 48 see as to them returning to their homelands or whatever 50 40 affected still he said 20 years later it's loose on the bride well you know what he could see them demons already loosed and there to drive us to what the message of the hour very simple point the prophet then when the seals broke he saw those demons and those things and like I've always told you when he got into that four seal he was going to speak on Armageddon I remember first time reading that and I said well I was reading oh I was really man I'm gonna get over here and I'm gonna be able to tell them guys at work where Russia comes from China comes from it's come this comes in because it always talked about it the Pentecostal preachers you know the King of the North or the Syrian that would come down huh thought I'd be able to explain when he finished that he said see he said them demons said them Supernatural he said they're Protestants and Catholics coming together after the little bride and I go phew I mean I thought I was going to be able to explain it didn't even have a quote but you see that Prophet saw all them time but you know what else he saw he saw a bride that would become that that's what I like and regardless of what we think that we don't see this we don't see that God to that Prophet saw a bride that would become the word and he spoke of her you said this prophet in the Malachi 4 will be pointing to the skies at a word born bride as I said this morning listen to the tapes and read the books and listen to him describing how beautiful we are in the eyes of God every message is in there with one way or the other speaking on it you remember that message after a red warning or something got a tape you know called invasion of the U.S one man I held that tape I run home and I put it on there we're gonna say it meets real down there and just see them boats coming maybe while he got preaching about spirits and Catholics and Protestants and things that really I wanted to turn the tape off foreign I don't mind talking straight and honestly I just I was downhearted I thought I was gonna find out some great big things but then I did find it out you know I began to realize like no fourth sealed those demons coming from Protestants and Catholics if we met right now on the battlefield do you know that in World War One they had the Germans had on their belt buckle In God We Trust if we met today you guys have been in there anymore you had to look down there and it said What Faith to you are you Catholics or Protestants or whatever you know what if you met today and you have all them armies coming over a record they need to be Catholics or Protestants you know in Russia would be doing the same thing but you understand what I'm getting at see we think we've got it figured out when we come to find out we're not even in the ballpark because we're not where the Prophet was talking of the things in his description of it in his description fits about his description fits the Bible because that's where it came from and he talked about the bride being the final voice to the final age under her messenger yeah that she would be the final voice that he has no voice but yours and mine he has no feet he has no hands do you need that quote if you do go ahead number three two pull up number three I think two or three which is here ye him Jesus has no eyes tonight but mine and years of on Earth he has no hands but mine and yours he has no voice but mine and yours you mean he has did he thinks so much of us until he has committed to you and I the opportunity to describe him what about that Arizona the ability to describe him you realize you're talking of one God and trying to show people in times that you're describing God and that's not that away you're describing God to what you see that's why it's so hard to put it into words because you know and realize that a lot of times you try to put it in what the prophet said which I I don't get a chance to talk too much anymore but when I used to work and if I you know I would think when I start talking to somebody I was sitting there thinking what is the prophets say well did the prophet say and I just you know it was like that well that was well and good but one day I realized they want to know what I'm talking about right because God told me one day so don't tell me no more what that Prophet said tell me what you say right and uh it's okay but are you with me a final description of himself because we are the the final voice to the final age we are the uh final form of God to the Gentile dispensation that's right all right and then this description of itself is describing not and listen I know you try to build something up and then you say something people just you talk funny I guess I do it's not describing me and you he's describing himself right but the thing of it is he's in you and I right Paul said it's Christ in the hope of glory where do we get on over that glory and all of that seven full Glory see he's describing it as he does oh go ahead number five brother now the paragraph 221 of the invisible Union 65 11 25. and look what he says the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same thing same word and see there's where it goes back what I just don't see it well you know what let me quote brother random and I'm sorry to quote it but you know what he said he says not for you we don't want to quote that quote do we that's what he said he said if you can't see it and you can't believe it it's not for you what I'd at least shut up about saying I don't see it right you know right because you know what I'm doing when I'm saying I don't see it I'm admitting I don't see it and by admitting I don't see it that means I ain't part of it let me hit this who was it one of the Great men down through time there he said preach Faith until you get Faith all right but you see it then he's talking about a bride form a bride standing there in Revelations 1. one standing in the midst of the seven golden candles we follow that point as being the church ages and the things and he said why are we here all right but where is he at he's in her manifesting himself the way he wants it all right didn't we stopped this morning we got to the point I had to cut it off it said one standing in the Mr Seven gold candlesticks gird about the pouch with a golden girl all right now Pat 's means feminists does not mean masculine but it is a description now listen you must make it a description of the high priest especially when we get on over into the the uh girdle and how it is done because John had a girdle the Bible says I think his was leather uh Paul had a girdle if they took off of him and gird him and said they'll do this to you when you go to Rome see it was a customary thing it was simply a peace where the men and the women now used it to kind of pull things in it's not they flop out you know and I do pretty good if I'm holding my breath but I have to breathe and I certainly don't want a girdle all right because that's all that's what the words mean all right and in some of the forms of the girdles it goes back to a uh it was a place where people carried money you called them money belts you know but they would do that evidently in Bible times would carry the money in that because you know that was a place of of I guess rolling it up in there and it would not just be one like now that you got the thing and you put your foot in the back and you pull the strings you know the lady goes in and then you time it wouldn't basically that way it was just a a something that was a part of your garment and I don't know where you men know this and mostly women are probably say I'm crazy you know that a belt is not to hold your pants up who knows that none of you no you know they had suspenders for that is a decorative piece all right let it hold my breaches up now some of these kids today they need some long suspenders okay all right just giving you a little see I did try to look up the girls and things and you know and to find out and for this next few minutes you've got to depend on the profit not her own assumptions okay we can assume assume and we can talk about it but it still doesn't mean very much uh we're gonna have to depend on what he says okay all right so we'll do it that way all right but now look it's shown as gerd about the paps now anybody who you know knows what that is that's feminist women that blessed are the Pops that never gave suck Etc everybody knows that all right when we get to it in a minute the girdle is moved from the place of servant to the place of Judge all right go we're going to read those things and uh but first get is Gert about to pass meaning it's a feminist form it is the Bride of Jesus Christ God thought enough of that to put it in his Bible that he would distinguish things I love one like unto the son of man see then I'm not looking for the son of man right right I'm looking first whatever that son of man represents or is in that way but I'm looking at it in another form because I would be looking at one person all right and see then it's good about the past meaning it's feminism it's a feminist description all right now how can you bring that down to Human terminologies to uh Define the point uh I'll save you the trouble don't do a lot of of uh guessing because you'll try to make it the breastplate of error no no that's not the judgment you'll try to make it this kind of doings or that thing you know so just make it what it is and the way the prophet says that when you dress that high priest before he put on the breastplates and the different things before that was put on he already had this girdle around his waist to hold his clothes in you know and it was made out of material but yet probably dipped in gold or something because oh you wouldn't make it out of a pure gold thing but you got to define the way that you're reading it because it'll sound like it's gold and it'll sound like it's some kind of linen so just put it together and get it right and just take your linen and dip it in the gold and put it around you all right you've got the description of the Bible terminology but it was pretty hold of things and uh it was made to worry that they were other things up above would not be able to move it was kind of like holding things in place and and just to sell you in plain language uh it would mean like if you had a thing down here holding your your garment in you know and then things would go inside but it's not referring to that but I'm describing it and it wouldn't fall out but that was the purpose of the Curious girdle and you'll find it called out and you'll find it called girdle and it was part of the um attire or the garments that the high priests wore other people wore them all right and then everybody wound up with them because it was good to have you know all right keep kind of things in place and I sure liked it because I remember reading this part and I said if you worked with you worked they had shorter garments which he wore and the longer garments well it didn't write in there about this but I I got one of my own if I was down there with a big old garment and it spread a way out and a big old bar got after me I know what would happen most of my garment would go inside my girdle and I'd run right he's had a lot of purposes for it but not those things maybe for the high priest all right because it was part that he had to go through and it tells you what they're in in Exodus and you know even in Leviticus and going over as to what these were all right now get to the point it says it's gird about the pouch with a golden girdle now see we don't have the definition written out in the scriptures that have said so we have to go with the the uh part we just have the writings about it so then we have to to go because I said if you start trying to do it the long try it you'll find out you'll just go hey we're trying to figure out where all this runs and what all this runs to and I could not find one connection between the uh girdle that was here and moving it up to be something in the judgment best we could do was come up with a defining of maybe two pictures waiting and found them I had looked at them but they've got a couple so brother Joe if you'll pull up one of them let us look at it you know we can get a little idea about maybe uh the Garment because it's first down here and then it can be moved they do growl out some things of what they think it looks like and they do draw one with the girdle put right across here right would sound like it fitting but you know not necessarily all right but look that you've got a you know the golden size they call it but you can see that it's across the breast when it's connecting up on the shoulders all right that may be a point look at the next one the other one and see it has it just as a shoulder garment you know whatever it is you'll read here we will what the prophet says that it's in one position it means servant like I said if you were getting down to wash somebody's feet you could just take your garments stick it down into your thing that was around just called a sash it's called different things and you could go about your doings all right but I'm not concerned about whether they fit it correctly you know and what it is I'm more concerned with staying with what the prophet has to say in a definition so let's read it we'll get these we won't spend too much time on it but we'll we'll read a few things are we done been through that it's a you know the gird about the pouch we know what the pouts are and and the girdle but let's read this going up to number eight Brothers and let's read what it says about this what the prophet has to say all right taken from Patton's vision um 1960 1204 paragraph 183 come to the Ancient of Days who hired with white as wool and John turned and he saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with Snow White hair that's not in the Bible right because he's describing the judge with the rest of the Bible he's telling you what that looks like all right with us know what hired the judge not girded around the waist but girded around the pouch up here a lot you'd want to move it across this way and do but what and a judge with the size of the judge over his shoulder all right he stood with a girdle pure holy refined girdle that was held that held his righteousness his cover he was covered all the way to the feet watch the Sevenfold Glory of his manifestation all right now look at the next one Patmos Vision which would be page 53 Church age book there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not his priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer gird around the waist or the priest must worry it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not he is not known not now the priest but the judge all right so it goes all the way over to where it's at all right now I clipped this to her this morning with talking about the things and I'll encourage you not to go into Paul about the breastplate of righteousness and and the different things you won't get the the the things that uh you know will be fitting to what you're talking about because it was a girdle and it was moved it was put in another position if that high priest walked out from behind that Veil all right he went in with it here go to be service you know offering the sacrifices if he walked out from behind that veil with that girdle in a different place they knew trouble wasn't him right any time that he would in his service that he would be working and all at once he would change and put it in another place it would mean judgment is at hand all right now but what I want you to think about is what we're connecting it together with that John is seeing the Bride of Jesus Christ all right and he's seeing her on Earth scripture you remember Jesus God gave no judgment he placed it in the hands of his son you remember that I'm gonna give you the scripture I got it laid here somewhere it was in the hands of his son he had no uh no doings all right I got it laid in here somewhere but anybody ought to know what I'm sorry in the scripture it's in the hands of his son well now where is the why are you dealing with these shoulders why would you not stop on just the paps because you wouldn't have the judgment that's what I told you without the divide it divide it with a hair because it's gird about the pounds to represent feminism but you've got to bring it across the shoulders right right irregardless of what you do because what did he say in Isaiah the government shall be upon what his shoulders all right there's no judgment of God God has no judgment it's the son that does the judge him all right now if the son does the judging then where's the Sun he's in US now who's going to judge a world according to Corinthians right does it not say that the Saints shall judge the Earth right why because if you look at the pyramid it is drawn out don't bring us up no further this would be the neck that'd be the head so here's the shoulders the body the body right imposed our superimpose a picture you would put the neck and you'd put the head and you'd have the body of Christ you know that in every age mankind has been judged or willing to watch our own you know going on down I mean it's passed on we know that but you get the right story but each age that word that was in that age could never age right you follow me every age is judged by the word of the people they hear the Ephesus Earth Church age won't have to answer for what the Ephesians has to answer when you realize what you are when you go out to her you realize that this your own life that you're just living out of you know being a Christian and you sisters you go out and you have your long hair you don't have the pain on your face you don't have the things like that you realize you're judging those people of course a lot of people will say well let's put on a little makeup where we won't judge them well you go ahead because you wound up falling on their sides now you're lost sorry oh hell no playgrounds No Gray areas that way mm-hmm you realize the clothes that you're wearing you know the dresses the clothes that you women are wearing that every one of them women out there will be judged by it that sees that you don't have to preach you don't have to stand on a street corner and holler and scream all about all the things you just walk down through Walmart right remember Wade in June and brother you know and they were just going down an alley and here he goes and he's been here a few times and he goes down and he where do y'all go to church no a lot of women wear long clothes who is that dog the lady that had to hired it was Crystal Gayle had hired it was so long until it would just drag the ground behind her you know of course you cut it you know but she had that long hair well see they they could look at her and see that she wouldn't know you know I've always said you don't put a car out on the side of the road to try to sell it with all the dents pointing towards the highway right you put the dents on the far side where they won't be sand until they get through looking at the good side you say what do you mean by that well what I mean by that is you see women that they'll let down here and even the dress will go down here right didn't you see women that are really tied up here and everything but it comes up this way I was trying to sell automobiles I'm just trying to be straight but be a little comical where you'll think about that see if you live your life men and women in front of the people of this world they will be judged one day now especially when you come to the white throne and and God will say did you tell them about that you know did you tell them why you wore the long hire and no makeup in times did you tell them did you men tell them why you didn't look like you know peep though to the Tulips you know way back in my day you know if you don't you don't look that away you know I believe if the Lord Jesus was here brother Branson said he'd have on the suit of clothes and look like we do believe you'd know him by a robe walking down the street no he'd have them clothes they look like we look because you wouldn't be able to talk to nobody like that except the hip is done on 10th Street but get what I'm trying to say you know that judgment begins at the house of the Lord and if it begins at the house of the Lord's word is the rest of them wind up right and you know what I love the way the prophet describes it he said at judgment it will not be the old sinner that comes by you know the throne just illustrating it paraphrasing it he says they'll just bow her head and walk right on you know would it be those that are anointed of the spirit of God and and look like and dressed like and act like Christians Maybe and they'll say have not I done this or how not I done that he'll say depart from me I never knew you wouldn't that be a horrible thing I'm not throwing in no Stones I'm talking there's a lady done at maze with it she's probably at least 80 or maybe a little more and you know I've known her since I was just a kid and as far as looking at her dress she could have made one and washed it every day and put it back on because I never saw her change the style of dresses always every dress is made the same look the same you could have took a picture of her at 30. 40 50 60 70. and she'd look the same I'm not saying she's not going to make it but what if it is that that's what she bases it upon and then when she winds up at the end of the road she's spent all of her life in that way and yet she won't be in heaven saying anything that's between her and God that's not me and you and her and that's fussing it out he said well it's just what's in the heart that's what everybody says that God knows my heart I said that's a trouble if he didn't know your hearts you could get by with it because out of the heart precedeth all things but my point is what you realize one day he at least somewhere he will be glorified in the midst of the church and he will be standing not as a priest but we he will be the coming judge we just read in the whole body of believers the Saints shall judge the Earth Prophet explaining that on spoken word Original Seed Saints shall judge the Earth that's right I don't oh don't dare you go to court one another and not take it before the church right so ain't still judge the Earth where is the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders that's a part of the body what is it the Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth bringing it to pass what about it but I didn't think that they they'd have to be judged everybody's going to be judged God ain't gonna send nobody to Hell without being judged first you've got to be judged see all right it meant that when it was down here tied around the waist that he was in serving we said now it's tied over his shoulder and he walk out with a girdle tied around the top with a size over his shoulder girded about the paps the breasts with a golden girdle girded up high what is it an attorney a judge he can put it all together in in and bring it up well because he's talking about the bride of Christ but now let's don't be like a lot of people would say they uh come on let's go downtown and judge them people you're the only one that's going to get judged in that case you ain't gonna be no judge it's when you're doing things automatically as a human being not to try to impress or or try to pull you know but to try to just be yourself as a Christian and then being that you're going to judge the world's going to be judged by you is it not so with the Book of Daniel that we could go into it's not the Book of Revelations talking about the watch on judgment in the Book of Daniel 7 and 9 and 10 where it goes on into that there'll be one sitting on the throne right hair like woo we'll get into these things later but there's going to be thousands or some thousands ministering unto him the prophet said we will see it on the throne and judge the world go be a big old room right gonna be a lot of things taking place but you know I know I get carnal and I try to figure things out I try to figure out maybe how many millions of years it'd take for the white Throne to take place you know but then one day I just thought well you know what if it's us well why not put a few million over here with this group and a few million over with another group of the Bride of cry and let that little group that's our judgment you can get it over with just like that we can go on into eternity right I just think Carnival huh but she ain't tying up millions of years trying to find out being judged my point is if it's him and us you know that your judgment will be the same as his right I got in trouble trying to explain this years ago here I go again I get in trouble okie dokie what about when it comes to the Watcher on judgment you realize when your own children comes before you your own grandchildren great-grandchildren or something just using it you can't have one judgment in him have another his judgment will be straight blunt that's it did you witness you'd have to say yes I did then he would have to say your judgment is just and you'd have to say your judgment is just the person would have nothing to argue um but just what if it is that he looks back and he says but that was your children they may have went wrong but they stood up for you one day somebody said something about you one day and they stood up for you they said don't talk about my mama like that my daddy my brothers my sisters my uncle granddaddies or whatever grandmothers see the Judgment would be said because it'd be nothing to change judgment's not going to be somebody going up and arguing a case right it ain't going to be millions of years of Arc In the case where if you don't like your attorney your fire and get you another one no it's going to be instantly quick because he can bring your whole life right before you in a split second right but just what if he says that was your neighbor you remember the neighbors that lived beside her brother Branham you remember I believe it was Rebecca wasn't it that told about it said Daddy said they'll get eternal life said because they never complained about all of the times that you know the people were here and coming by in the middle of the night and do it I said they'll be given eternal life she's not all over with here on the basis of that it's all over with here on what the Judgment part is yes but remember he can change judgment to Grace and I tried to explain that years ago and his brother said are you saying that your family is going to be saved I said if God wants to again now let's back up we're on Earth all right right we ain't had to watch on judgment right okay we're on Earth okay back up with me get out of heaven and come back down here to worry that is being seen on Earth as the bride of Christ and why can't you believe for your family may I quote the prophet if you don't have enough faith for your family I'm paraphrasing it'll be close to right he said I doubt you having faith for yourself but I can't I just look how bad they've done most of it is because you're mad at them because they didn't do what you wanted them to do right come on Mamas and Daddy is you think well this one can make it God he's been a pretty good guy but that ain't no good oh you're a good mom and a daddy right yeah and I didn't talk about planning to get to the white throne in my kids and grandkids and I'll get there and then me plead the case I didn't say that I said my judgment would be the same as his judgment which would mean condemnation but he can change condemnation to Grace but why can't we believe for our children yeah but look how bad they're getting how bad did you get huh what hole did God have to have to dig you out of it you know what we're not planning to do anything wait and let God speak to you amen he told me said you'll be there with your offspring all right there's this one that was way out there a long ways well we said I got the perfect example in my two boys I got the prodigal son and and the Wayward one I mean the The Prodigal Son and the the good one Terrence has just been with us all along he just never left but here goes Wayne out he goes I ain't seeing Terence stayed too good because you remember my illustration his Halo was held up by a couple of horns up there that Wiggles because he was a kid and so is the kids and the grandkids and the great grandkids all right but it's a perfect example of one going out and you having to call for him well you see I call from everyone who called for the wives the kids the grandkids every one of them he'll be there as my offspring then I'm not going to accept that I've got to wait to get there to get them I never have taught that let him get you in a car and run you down the highway unless you run up against a tree and you get out and go walking down the side of the road and three or four people comes riding up and say where was the other guy right right if you want to sit back our grinning the people come up wondering where was the other man that was in the car because they saw a man walk all three of them get out of the car and walk home he's still working on me why can't you believe for your kids what you believe for believe it if they'd straighten up my Lord if I could believe that no problem it's when they won't straighten up got to get keep getting worse in the worse you get the more you grinning okay God you're gonna have to take care of this because I couldn't have done it a long time ago right because remember if we're going to judge we are going to have to have something to judge right is that right nice point we can talk about the size and moving it around do whatever we want where to put it what to do with it you can get all that but what about the judge I didn't ask to be this God chose me he makes us judges but you know those judges are priests and kings you know you can have a judge and then kind of override him right they just get a higher judge ain't no right to judge even them great judges of England with the white wig of superiority you realize the king can just go there and go that no more because they had to kind of honor the Kings stay in good with them you know because they could remove them but who's going to remove the king are you with me I'm not down there a lot are you with me who's going to remove the king I thought we were priests and kings who can remove us well God can now wait just a minute if he made me that right you are going to have to argue the case with him he made me the king well he took David out he didn't take David out and they dirtly died right come on look Church we want to argue about the Garment the things or putting it to our pictures of it and we miss the whole story and it's talking about us in a beautiful beautiful marvelous understanding that all of the scriptures come down into being fulfilled in the bride of Christ amen and then you wonder and then you think about well I don't know where I am in the word amen you know where we are in order I know I'm not where I want to be in the word are you what am I worried about where I am in the word if I find myself in the written word I got a good case because I can say now Lord this right here talks about somebody and may I read this to you that it means somebody that has studied all of this and accepted all of this and accepted you as their Savior and believe that all is true and then in the relies to the book it's written why can't I believe I am that person that's a problem let's stand come on foreign what does it mean to be in the body of Christ it means all of the Bible is fulfilled all the Bible will be made manifest in a little group of people on the bride how much more could I speak about what God has to say about you and I if he looked at David in the dirty manners that he was and all the things and he said a man after my own heart and he looks at a group of people that compare it to the world and we're very low I'm talking about the religious world untruthfully you know because today they're running the aisles they're screaming and hollering about God and what he's doing and we sit and give a good grin every once in a while and head shake for amen what about it what do we got boys okay Go Go Tell It on the Mountain s anybody have a knee that Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ is born God is waiting on the people to believe and everywhere but brother damn I've got so many problems I didn't ask you about your problems because he can't override your free moral agency he can't make you be saved all you gotta do other we send this word offer the need that our sister has we believe it's a finished product you take care of everything because we are here your children and your children can call out to the father and the father will come on the scene we believe you Lord in Jesus anybody else Jesus Christ is think about it two thousand years talking about Jesus Christ isn't it odd don't you think that way isn't it odd that in the end of the Bible and Through the Bible you would be trying to bring if you caught what I was talking about you're trying to bring into being a God that can be comprehended by mankind you know the whole Bible is describing that God and his ways and thought and then when you get to the end of it it starts talking about the people well then we come to find it out you know that the Bible was them people down there now quote to prophet he said the Believers in the book you know there wouldn't be no Genesis or without Moses without I mean the Abraham and the different ones that are listed in Genesis Adam and Eve you know there wouldn't be no book of Acts without the people that were the her you know that there wouldn't be an end time without people well why can't we believe Who We Are why don't we start saying Who We Are no we'll go outside and when you're going to doctor tomorrow I gotta go do this I gotta go for that sleep acne tomorrow would you call that crazy thing tomorrow night they're gonna have trouble getting this old boy to sleep they don't need to praying for me for anything else except pray for me to go and go to sleep because I can go to sleep with a drop of a hat but then when you tell me I got to go to sleep I'm like a little kid there's too much going on that's right I mean whatever they tell me I got I just laugh and grin and just go right on okay that's what I told him the other day he was talking about this out in the other I said I was a 74 year old supposed to feel good because he wouldn't send me forward he couldn't understand I said what am I supposed to feel well don't you feel this or don't you feel that no okay we're running an hour it doesn't bother me what they tell me I know who the healer is well you changed your mind when you laid on death bed I pray to God I won't because I'll be looking up and saying don't you talk like that in here get out of here and leave me alone because I've confessed it all this time I'll keep confessing it why because I know who the healer is I know who's took care of me all of these years I know who he is I know what he's trying to get me to believe of who I am what about you father we love you Lord and if there's nothing else could ever keep I could ever keep saying is that one thing I love you because Lord I truly do I love you with all my heart my soul my mind and my being because I have nothing else yes Lord we're sorry we're human we're Mortals we do things but yet at least listen to her cries believe the hearts of your people reveal unto us who we are Lord you reveal to Martin Luther one day and he just went out and turned the world upside down help us go with us home Lord take care of us take care of everybody bless God each and every one of us in Jesus name you dismissed pray one for another remember now no service Wednesday night created me
