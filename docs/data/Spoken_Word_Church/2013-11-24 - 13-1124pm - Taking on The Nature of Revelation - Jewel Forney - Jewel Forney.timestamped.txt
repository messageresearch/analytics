[6:15] to the word of God in uh in the book of
[6:18] St John the thir chapter in 1 Timothy
[6:21] the 4th chapter I'm begin reading at
[6:24] first
[6:26] John first chapter I mean first John the
[6:30] thir chapter excuse me what I'm saying
[6:33] first John St John St John I'm thinking
[6:36] about St John excuse me that's my bad
[6:41] amen that's the one I want must be that
[6:45] pizza
[6:49] amen praise God uh starting at the first
[6:53] verse that's what I'm trying to think
[6:54] about and it says
[6:56] here there was a man of the first
[7:00] es named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews
[7:04] the same came to Jesus by night and said
[7:08] unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a
[7:11] teacher come from God for no man can do
[7:15] these Miracles that thou does except God
[7:18] be with him Jesus answered said unto him
[7:22] verely verely I say unto the except a
[7:26] man be born again he cannot even see the
[7:28] kingdom of God right
[7:30] and Nicodemus said unto him how can a
[7:33] man be born when he is
[7:35] old can he enter the second time into
[7:37] his mother wound and be born born
[7:41] born Jesus and they and and Jesus
[7:44] answered brother brother I say unto thee
[7:47] except a man be born of the water and of
[7:50] the
[7:51] spirit Spirit he cannot even enter the
[7:54] kingdom of God that's right that which
[7:57] is born of the flesh is flesh that which
[8:00] is born of the spirit is Spirit let's go
[8:05] to a first Peter I mean first
[8:11] Timothy the 4th
[8:18] chapter First
[8:21] Timothy the 4th
[8:23] chapter and it reads like this in the
[8:26] first verse he said now the spirit speak
[8:28] expressly that in the latter
[8:31] time some shall depart from the faith
[8:35] giving heed to seducing
[8:37] spirits and doctrines of devils let's
[8:41] prayer father help me one more time to
[8:45] yeld my body my mind my spirit my soul
[8:48] to you father speak to your people
[8:51] through your word we ask it all in the
[8:53] name of Jesus Christ now father just
[8:56] give us gr father in Jesus name we pray
[8:59] amen God bless you you may be seated one
[9:03] moment thank the Lord for the reading of
[9:06] the word of God this evening and we
[9:09] looked at the word of God this evening I
[9:10] took from the scripture here what Jesus
[9:13] was speaking to Nicodemus and Nicodemus
[9:16] came to Jesus by night we know the story
[9:18] and Nicodemus is literally if you notice
[9:21] what he's doing he complimenting Jesus
[9:23] on his
[9:24] miracles that's great he came to Jesus
[9:27] and he he said we that no man can do
[9:30] these Miracles except God be with him HJ
[9:34] in other word he was giving Jesus a
[9:36] compliment and Jesus never he just
[9:38] completely ignored what he
[9:41] said you know no normally when a man
[9:43] come up and would give you in a
[9:45] compliment about a a Ministry something
[9:47] oh yeah yeah yeah Lord been using this
[9:49] gift of mine but Jesus completely en
[9:53] know it and Jesus go right to the
[9:55] scripture man you need to be born again
[9:57] you don't need to be watching the
[9:58] miracle you you need to get the Life of
[10:00] Christ on the inside if I had a title
[10:03] this evening for a few minutes I'm going
[10:05] to use a title taking on the nature of
[10:07] Revelation taking on the nature of
[10:10] Revelation and the reason I took this
[10:12] thought because you know it's just one
[10:13] thing to know God and know that God is
[10:17] uh what God can do but there's another
[10:20] thing to know that God doing it in
[10:22] you so it's a not different than know
[10:24] that God can do it than know that God
[10:26] doing it in me so we want to me we we
[10:29] realized that was Jesus when Jesus was
[10:31] dealing with Nicodemus he told Nicodemus
[10:33] he said Nicodemus Nicodemus came and no
[10:36] doubt he probably thought hey man let me
[10:37] let I'm coming by Night by the way I
[10:40] want to let him know that we know that
[10:41] he's a man s from God but it was
[10:43] something all the Miracles he did they
[10:46] had set back and they had come to the
[10:48] conclusion hey God got to be in this man
[10:50] but because of their Theology and
[10:53] because of what they was brought up in
[10:55] they was not able to turn their heart to
[10:57] God and Jesus told Nicodemus what you
[11:00] need to do man you need to be born again
[11:02] how Nicodemus being a teacher a man well
[11:05] taught in the scripture he asked him a
[11:07] coral question y right can a man enter
[11:10] the second time his mother wouldn't be
[11:12] born again Jesus look at come on man
[11:15] you've been going to church all these
[11:16] years you don't understand the
[11:17] revelation of the word how you know what
[11:20] so you know what Jesus said you you must
[11:23] in other words Jes required him to be
[11:24] born of the spirit and water Hallelujah
[11:27] that is the flesh is blood that is
[11:28] spirit is Spirit but that we begin to
[11:30] look here I begin to realize in in the
[11:32] book of Timothy it say that many shall
[11:35] depart from the faith giving he to
[11:38] seducing spirit and doctrines of devils
[11:41] H so we begin to realize here the only
[11:43] thing that we got in this AG that make
[11:45] us different from any other age is the
[11:48] nature of this Revelation right I want
[11:51] you to notice here we are the only the
[11:54] predestinated hallah god called for this
[11:57] say is a group of people that have
[11:59] something in there that they can receive
[12:02] Revelation from God that God can speak
[12:05] back to you y God don't speak like you
[12:08] know in word God speak to us by
[12:11] Revelation something come your way God
[12:13] give you a revelation how to deal with
[12:14] it Hallelujah in other word God give us
[12:17] Revelation supernaturally that's his way
[12:19] of speaking back to us hallelujah so in
[12:22] other word he can be preaching you but
[12:24] one day and she sitting around and all
[12:26] of a sudden somebody turned on the light
[12:29] that was no accident that was God way of
[12:32] speaking to you that's way God speak to
[12:35] me you hear preach you hear teach or Sam
[12:38] teacher and he put all the mechanics out
[12:41] there and one day the light come on
[12:44] right and you said wow that's what I
[12:46] been I didn't I know I what it was that
[12:49] was the light H so that's God way of
[12:51] speaking so I'm begin to look so wonder
[12:54] why we need Revelation the point of
[12:56] Revelation is if if you do do not have
[12:59] Revelation for this hour you will not be
[13:02] able I don't care how good you is or how
[13:05] holy you been I don't care how long
[13:07] you've been raised in church if you do
[13:09] not have Revelation you will not be able
[13:12] to overcome the powers of hell am it
[13:16] would not do you would not you cannot
[13:18] fight against this realm with with with
[13:20] human ability that if you notice he
[13:23] would continually it was a reason for
[13:26] him and like God of this evil age
[13:29] if you notice in God this EV AG he begin
[13:31] to talk about uh he said as this modern
[13:35] This Modern na love love he said this Mo
[13:39] modern knowledge love and age people
[13:43] want knowledge more than anything else
[13:46] and I'm not I'm not not I don't support
[13:48] this I believe that a man I learn
[13:50] everything again if you know you say
[13:52] when I when I I I I used to when I first
[13:54] come in the message one of the thing
[13:56] they taught you don't need education
[13:58] well I disagree with that right hall if
[14:01] you want to get a job you want to be
[14:02] working in McDonald's all your life
[14:04] don't get none right Hallelujah words in
[14:07] that when you put you I but the point of
[14:09] is I believe that we ought to you know
[14:10] we ought to teach our kids to be
[14:12] educated but by the same token don't let
[14:14] that come against the word of God
[14:16] because you cannot know God by education
[14:19] you must know him by Revelation huah so
[14:22] don't let just get that so those that
[14:24] have been a group to come to talk this
[14:27] say how preacher rais the teacher you
[14:29] don't need no education you don't need
[14:31] to you need to be humble how do you
[14:33] don't need to buy when I first come to
[14:35] Mage one of the first things he t one
[14:37] thing they tell me don't you don't you
[14:39] go out here you buy the cheapest car
[14:41] that you can buy and all this stuff and
[14:43] I did that yeah yeah that was not that
[14:46] was not knowledge that was
[14:50] stupidity CU I ended up buying 10 cars
[14:52] in one year so so I really didn't G that
[14:57] by listening to this stuff but that's
[14:59] the way time you just need to be humble
[15:01] you got your car it's smoking every day
[15:04] you all a Simplicity no you always
[15:06] stupidity Hallelujah get you something
[15:08] that going to run you need to get to
[15:10] church how you need to get to work so
[15:12] that all those things but we talking
[15:14] about this knowledge love and a how did
[15:16] they're trying to meet Christ by how
[15:18] much they learn it is not given how much
[15:21] you learn it's how who do you know
[15:24] Hallelujah it ain't important that you
[15:26] know everything but you is important you
[15:28] know the alt it's very important you
[15:31] know the alt so he giving here he's
[15:34] talking about this knowledge loving Edge
[15:36] right knowledge yep and what everybody
[15:39] wanted you and you could have a and
[15:42] either you could have no
[15:45] better learning
[15:47] then no learning then the one they got
[15:50] Satan a perverter of the word of of God
[15:54] like he started off in Eden like he
[15:56] started off in the garden any but a
[15:58] relig religious person rely upon his own
[16:02] understanding so he taking it back he oh
[16:05] goodness man that's all
[16:07] right man iy well this good but you do
[16:10] like SS cuz they they come up with some
[16:12] good stuff Hallelujah I mean you can't
[16:14] put it out it's good or evil how so if
[16:17] you use it right it'll work for you if
[16:19] you use it against you if you use it
[16:21] wrong it will send you scra to hell
[16:24] don't pass go Hallelujah so in other
[16:27] words he said didn't could have
[16:29] perverted of the word he started off at
[16:31] Eden but a but a religious person rely
[16:34] upon his what own understanding in the
[16:38] book he as as I said before proverb 53
[16:43] said that we're not to to lean on our
[16:46] own understanding what what we living in
[16:48] we living in here that everybody you
[16:51] come to they have studied and they have
[16:54] studied and they have studied but where
[16:56] is the life of God when peoples have
[16:59] come so close to this meure and begin to
[17:02] turn back and go back to the world
[17:05] giving heed to sedu the spirit and doct
[17:08] the devil all he had was a form of
[17:10] godliness and deny that Jesus Christ is
[17:13] the same as how we begin to look
[17:16] here let just take it let us let us look
[17:19] a little closer here so what I'm trying
[17:21] to get to why we got to have like I said
[17:23] Revelation because the bible say that
[17:26] the Gates of Hell have the Gates of Hell
[17:29] will fight against this thing and with
[17:32] that Revelation you will not be able to
[17:35] discern the spirit of this age now it
[17:38] ain't like it was in every age every
[17:41] other age and the darkg AG all they did
[17:44] was to say I accept the blood of Jesus
[17:46] Christ I'm going to die v Jesus they
[17:48] took their life and they went straight
[17:50] on in the glory but in this age yeah is
[17:54] more deceiving yes sir so this age right
[17:56] here this is a more deceiving AG because
[17:59] he said this is an edge when the devil
[18:01] have ped it up on the people and can
[18:03] make the people think they're right can
[18:05] make the people think they are Christian
[18:07] when they completely walking contrary to
[18:10] the word of this day so we got to finci
[18:14] and we got to realize here now the
[18:15] spirit we fight
[18:18] against I'm going to deal with it deal
[18:20] with kind of way the Lord show it to me
[18:22] the spirit we fight against is so
[18:25] deceiving it was only one one place in
[18:29] the Scripture it was ever
[18:31] mentioned you ever thought about that it
[18:34] was not a lot said about it the spirit
[18:36] that we fight against was only one place
[18:39] in the whole entire Bible this scripture
[18:42] was this word was
[18:44] mentioned you said oh man everybody
[18:46] thinking
[18:47] now he said yeah you said and wonder why
[18:50] it was not said a lot on this before I
[18:54] before before we read it I want you to
[18:57] understand one place in the Bible that
[18:59] this one word was ever mentioned there's
[19:02] no other scripture and there never
[19:05] anybody ever talk about it until a
[19:09] Prophet come on the scene and took
[19:11] prophetic insight and reveal the nature
[19:15] that was behind that
[19:17] word you said let's read it that's good
[19:21] let's go to
[19:23] Revelation find it myself Revelation
[19:26] Revelation three verse 15 and 16 let us
[19:31] see
[19:35] here Revelation three and I want to
[19:38] begin to
[19:41] read let me Revelation
[19:45] three first read he says I know that
[19:49] thou th thou or I know that thy works
[19:53] that thou are nether neither hot neither
[19:57] cold I I rather that thou was what cold
[20:00] or heart so because thou are
[20:04] what that is the only place you will
[20:07] find that word because that word right
[20:10] there was going to be what Satan was
[20:12] going to use the script the church for
[20:15] and use that power and he have done it
[20:18] amen amen because thou luk W need a hot
[20:22] not a cold I will spute thee out of my
[20:26] mouth Hallelujah so we R here there's a
[20:28] group of people that's in the mouth of
[20:31] God how a group of people will be that
[20:35] come to the point that God is for the
[20:37] mouth H but they never got in the mind
[20:41] because the bride is not in the mouth of
[20:43] God she's in the mind of
[20:45] God so now that mean that you can not
[20:48] respect a will in his mind but some
[20:51] group of people they made it to the
[20:53] mouth have tasted of the word of God
[20:57] they have tasted of the word of God and
[20:59] a evil is a fe of the mouth the mouth a
[21:03] prophet is a type of evil because he
[21:05] feed his church mouth to mouth amen yes
[21:09] right so we find here that word
[21:12] lukew now why that's why we got to have
[21:15] Revelation cuz every man going to battle
[21:18] that knowing every place every person
[21:21] have got to fight against that Spirit it
[21:23] been one of the most deceiving most
[21:25] concepting spirit in his hand it say
[21:28] don't care how he don't care if Satan
[21:31] can get you in a lukewarm State he will
[21:34] run you till you finally just get tired
[21:36] something I'm going to quit right oh it
[21:39] ain't nothing to it I've been in it all
[21:41] my life come on brother now you remember
[21:45] wine does not decrease in strength right
[21:49] the longer you keep wine the stronger it
[21:51] get but the power that we fighting
[21:54] against in this age N I couldn't get him
[21:57] to preaching get him to
[22:00] read so come on up here my
[22:04] friend he said man I thought I had it
[22:08] made amen now I'm going to we're going
[22:12] to read this here and we going to read
[22:15] it
[22:16] today we're going to look here we I want
[22:19] you to notice here why all of a sudden
[22:23] nobody ever T about this never talked
[22:26] about this but when a Prophet come he
[22:29] immediately tax this spirit because what
[22:33] is he doing he's coming again the gates
[22:35] of hell now people let me say it before
[22:37] we read I say people say when we think
[22:40] about the gates of hell we always got it
[22:42] way out here the gates of hell is way
[22:44] over here hallelu in other words we
[22:46] overcoming drinking we overcoming
[22:48] smoking that is the gates of hell that
[22:50] ain't cause no problem there but the
[22:52] Gates of Hell raised up in church we
[22:56] deal with the gates of hell if people
[22:58] that have rejected the truth or will
[23:00] obey the message that was Gat of Hell
[23:02] started Judas was a gates of hell and
[23:06] Jesus overcoming so we got sometime
[23:08] gates To Hell raises right up in the
[23:10] church right so now he goes to he deals
[23:13] with this let me show you another reason
[23:16] why Satan hates this book of the
[23:17] revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[23:20] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[23:22] yesterday today and forever and changes
[23:23] know wait minut he know what mhm he know
[23:27] the devil's know d right he know that
[23:29] Jesus Christ is the what same yesterday
[23:32] today now we can get the people to
[23:34] believe that we're doing good right he
[23:36] won't let you believe it but he believe
[23:38] it he know that even one Lord one favor
[23:41] one baptis but he got the people
[23:42] believeing in three
[23:45] right okay he got it up there too you
[23:48] can read it they can read it okay he
[23:50] knows that a whole lot more than do 90%
[23:53] of the theologians right he knows that
[23:56] since God is immutable in his nature
[23:58] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[24:01] thus Satan knows assuredly that the
[24:02] original church at Pentecost with the
[24:04] power of God Mark 16 in action is the
[24:07] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[24:10] he got know wait a minute he got to
[24:11] stand that way by the way the same
[24:14] churches started there like he said
[24:16] brother like Brother Sam brother there
[24:19] had to be God had had a new creation how
[24:22] did Pentacost it didn't it started here
[24:25] a book of we got a song that's a brand
[24:28] new church raising up how the power of
[24:30] God has come back in this AG to produce
[24:33] the sa and the power of Pentecost back
[24:35] in the bride like it was then that was
[24:37] Christ in you the hope Glory by the way
[24:40] right it's a true church that Jesus
[24:42] claims as his own all else is false it
[24:44] has to be now remember this Christ in
[24:47] the true church is a continuation of the
[24:49] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[24:52] shows how that the Antichrist Spirit
[24:53] would come into the church and defile it
[24:56] making it loose
[24:58] ho m luk w yep now it's all strange he
[25:02] goes into this he looks him with proped
[25:06] insight and he hits the spirit just one
[25:09] word only filled in the Bible smoke
[25:12] showed in the Bible L one the anif
[25:15] spirit comes into the church defiling it
[25:18] Hallelujah not with drinking not with
[25:20] smoking if you that the church people a
[25:22] going to do that but he can make it luk
[25:25] one amen the five God dying out how the
[25:29] excitement the enthusiasm for the word
[25:31] is dying off the people hallelu and once
[25:33] he can get the people not being enthus
[25:35] about the word not being excited about
[25:37] the word hallelujah the church begin to
[25:39] get L war and people begin to drop off
[25:42] because they looking for some
[25:43] manifestation on the outside and the
[25:45] word receiving the word is a
[25:47] manifestation from the soul Hallelujah
[25:50] word your stimulation is not So Much
[25:52] from the outside the stimulation is from
[25:54] the soul the word moves from the inside
[25:57] all of a sudden you get all excited
[26:00] because you can see Christ coming alive
[26:02] not on the outside of you but on the
[26:04] inside of youen right

[30:44] take a position I'm going to tell God
[30:47] what to do no we don't tell God what to
[30:49] do we get oursel out of the way so God

[31:22] glasses yeah and everybody buming into
[31:25] the wall yeah exactly that we have that
[31:29] around the M somebody come up with some
[31:31] stupid idea that's right brother come on

[38:28] got fult right how do we all got fult
[38:31] how the point we don't be blinded by bro
[38:34] I look at a man like this he might have
[38:37] be the just think somebody Church they
[38:38] so weak and they might not be the best
[38:40] of the Christian M but something in them
[38:43] keep them coming to church right you
[38:45] ever thought about that that's enough
[38:47] alone to give Glory it's something in
[38:49] that person how you might not be where
[38:51] he ought to be but he can't get away
[38:52] from it how every time the church do
[38:54] over he's sting back there and he might
[38:56] not judge it might not come when you
[38:58] think you ought to come but as long as
[39:00] he sat under the atmosphere of the word
[39:02] let him sit right there and let him have
[39:04] church I said but we we too worried
[39:07] about trying to clean a person before we
[39:09] catch him right right
[39:13] exactly too many preach think man wait
[39:16] till I get up behind that pull pit I'm
[39:18] going to cut that place down had I seen
[39:21] that woman back there with earrings wait
[39:23] till I get through preaching she'll be

[39:30] nothing but run out of here I the word
[39:33] could have helped you but you tied to
[39:35] take it up on yourself I'm going to do
[39:37] it that's human effort human will and
[39:39] that's why people drove from the church
[39:41] a lot we think it's the Holy Ghost it
[39:43] ain't the Holy Ghost it's nism right
[39:46] amen trying to control somebody life but
[39:48] if it's the word of God preach the word
[39:51] if you ever get the person on the hook
[39:54] amen the problem that you never show the
[39:56] fish the hug right n you show him the
[39:59] bait and if he swallow the bait you got
[40:02] him on the hook how so you keep
[40:04] preaching and that person let God if he
[40:07] sat under the atmosphere now when it
[40:09] come time to deal with sin you got to
[40:11] hear sin right but we don't pick
[40:13] somebody out to try to pre personally
[40:16] build a message on somebody when they
[40:18] not even born again what you expect for
[40:20] Sinners to be right let me I don't know
[40:24] how I got on that go ahead but the point
[40:27] of this what I'm trying to show you but
[40:29] this this is what we a and to say and we
[40:31] a lot of time we are controlling the
[40:33] Holy Ghost and the control holy ghost is
[40:35] not in control and we think it this God
[40:37] and it ain't nothing but a spirit of Ni
[40:40] trying to force somebody to do something
[40:42] against your against your own will make
[40:45] them do it according to your will right
[40:47] right we want God yes that's right we
[40:50] want his will done in this church
[40:52] exactly not as our will Lord right but
[40:55] as thy will amen amen hallelujah is he
[40:57] going to go here so now we see this
[40:59] Angel reject him y now I want you to
[41:02] notice what that
[41:04] 325 okay 325 let me I got that orange
[41:08] Mark here but let me see right hold
[41:11] on uh I want you to notice
[41:13] here it's office screen like I said a
[41:17] lukewarm come over the message like
[41:20] never before right absolutely all of a
[41:23] sudden people's getting inspired mhm now
[41:26] the man of God went off the scene now
[41:29] people begin to raise up he's a false
[41:32] prophet he made this mistake he made
[41:34] that mistake he made this mistake and I
[41:37] I don't believe wonder what's causing
[41:39] that come on and then you got a group of
[41:41] people that been riding the mess of a
[41:44] year listen that all this junk on the
[41:46] internet yeah come on brother I don't
[41:48] eat beside my ear in the garbage can so
[41:50] they R sit there and listen at this
[41:52] perverted stuff defile their own mind
[41:55] because demons about words people when
[41:58] somebody begin to speak again if it was
[42:00] a truth and they had scripture for it
[42:02] one thing but when men begin to speak
[42:04] their own personality their own mind you
[42:06] better stay away from that stuff don't
[42:08] let a devil your mind exactly that's why
[42:12] we got people that walk with this
[42:13] message and walked away from this
[42:15] message because they didn't have enough
[42:17] discernment right listen to some man and
[42:20] they turn back and went to the same
[42:21] churches they come out of that's right
[42:24] that's going on right now y sir so
[42:26] people we better get on our toes yes sir
[42:28] this this the gates of hell ain't on the
[42:30] outside of church it's raising up on the
[42:32] inside of church H unconverted Minds
[42:35] people that hung around just like Judah
[42:37] how they waiting for the opportunity to
[42:39] try to crush God in now the point of it
[42:41] is you said brother JW did how do we
[42:43] know that you m true that's a good
[42:45] question mhm that's a good question
[42:48] right well let me say this to you I done

[51:37] man just like before Jesus comes just
[51:40] just before Jesus come he will be a
[51:42] prophet he will be a v he will be
[51:44] Vindicated as such by God since Jesus
[51:47] himself in the flesh won't be here to
[51:49] vindicate him as he did John it will be
[51:52] done by the holy spirit so that this
[51:54] prophet's ministry will be attended by
[51:57] great and wonderful manifestations as a
[52:00] prophet every revelation will be
[52:02] Vindicated forever revelation will come
[52:05] to pass right wonderful acts of power
[52:07] will be performed at his commands in
[52:09] faith then then will be brought forth a
[52:12] message that God has given him in the
[52:14] word to turn the people back to truth
[52:17] and the true power of God some will
[52:19] listen but the majority will run true to
[52:23] form and reject him run to form right
[52:27] what have we done come to church that's
[52:29] right everybody formed something you
[52:32] know the word form me is something that
[52:34] giveing shape to something else
[52:36] Hallelujah something else the word
[52:38] trying to shape us into the word of God
[52:40] but we'll give shape to somebody else
[52:43] opinion over a Vindicated Prophet
[52:46] somebody raised up on the internet and
[52:48] say brother invol Propet and we got
[52:50] enough people here I don't know I guess
[52:53] I I can see where you right what you you
[52:55] wor about if you was in the mind of God
[52:57] you would be worried about that amen
[52:59] amen that's the P that got to the mouth
[53:02] right amen that's right we are not in
[53:04] the mouth we in the mou Hall so we
[53:07] dealing about revelation we not dealing
[53:09] what we here say what somebody else said
[53:11] that's mouth Hallelujah the ones that
[53:13] was in the mouth when Jesus spoke the
[53:15] word that was in the mouth he can SC
[53:17] them out but Peter was in the mou said
[53:20] who shall we go that has the word a word
[53:23] and the thought right amen H who where
[53:26] we go that has the word amen the word is
[53:29] in our mind we love God hallelujah when
[53:32] they reject this message and start not
[53:34] only is they going to reject the message
[53:36] yep message yep they going to reject the
[53:40] manifestation of the mess the bride
[53:42] right amen because she's the final voice
[53:44] right you know a lot of times you go
[53:46] around family and you go around people
[53:48] like when I go around a lot of time they
[53:50] say don't let Jews
[53:52] speak that raise anybody up in prayer
[53:54] say something they don't want me to say
[53:55] nothing and I'm thinking what's wrong
[53:58] because they don't want to hear the
[53:58] voice of God I'm not going to rebuke
[54:00] them just tell them what truth says
[54:02] hallelujah nothing first for the first
[54:04] time in all the history out of 20 30 20
[54:07] uh 30 uh 32 years I've been serving the
[54:10] lord first time that ever my whole
[54:12] family ever come together is when my
[54:13] mother just died about about two or
[54:15] three weeks ago I preached a funeral Y
[54:19] and then all of them was there Y and
[54:21] they all had an attitude like he not
[54:24] like what we thought he was
[54:26] prob because somebody they hear somebody
[54:28] big mouth saying something about me that
[54:30] they didn't even know what they talking
[54:31] about just like they hear something
[54:33] about Jesus and didn't know what they
[54:35] talking about that why when Jesus come
[54:36] on the scene the people was the people
[54:39] quoting somebody mouth not the mind they
[54:42] said we not be born of fornication yeah
[54:44] come on that's said then they say that
[54:46] in the Bible we not be born of St John 8
[54:48] they we not be for and fornication where
[54:50] did they get that from yeah they didn't
[54:52] get it from the mind right no they got
[54:54] it was somebody big mouth saying
[54:56] something about Jesus that they did not
[54:58] have no scriptures to support him show
[55:01] me in the scripture what it said he come
[55:03] right he was not born of fornication
[55:05] neither was he illegitimate right if
[55:08] Mary would have had something to do with
[55:09] it h and she was to Joseph J would have
[55:13] come by a wrong act right but he did not
[55:15] come by Mar of about man he did not have
[55:18] man have nothing to do with it he
[55:20] created himself and do it so now who can
[55:24] tell Mary she gave see the Holy
[55:26] Ghost hello mm so you see what I'm
[55:29] saying y this word right here we got to
[55:31] get we got to know where we come from
[55:32] right if we come from the mind of God
[55:35] that mean that we are in them forever
[55:37] ain't nobody going to talk us out of
[55:39] neither is God going to get once God
[55:41] reute you out right once something Le
[55:44] the mouth of God right come on according
[55:47] to scripture he cannot return back cuz
[55:51] only the Bible only say a dog return to
[55:54] his
[55:55] right right God don't return
[55:58] lukewarmness made him sick at his
[56:00] stomach and he sped it out that mean
[56:03] that he can never come back to it it can
[56:05] never come back it's done reject it in
[56:07] other word we other word he done reject
[56:09] it but the Bible says here hallelujah
[56:12] but the bride got the word in her mouth
[56:14] amen hallelujah so now if they reject
[56:16] when they reject God how they going to
[56:18] reject God he said the word of God now
[56:20] in your mouth when they reject the word
[56:22] You Preach they are rejecting the mouth
[56:24] of God amen and when God deal with your

[1:17:34] strength and all going back home this
[1:17:36] afternoon then he's got to leave out and
[1:17:38] go to some more CU he's traveling so
[1:17:40] just tell him how much you appreciate
[1:17:41] him we do but church I've always told
[1:17:43] you one thing when the Devil comes in to
[1:17:47] beat you hard and try to beat you down
[1:17:51] just remember
[1:17:53] there's a great light fixing to open in
[1:17:55] front of
[1:17:57] you and you're the one that's going to
[1:17:59] stop it from opening so when everything
[1:18:01] starts going wrong you start worshiping
[1:18:03] I start looking when things start going
[1:18:05] wrong and everything going wrong I start
[1:18:07] looking right I start watching I pray I
[1:18:12] read I study I'm watching cuz
[1:18:14] something's fixing to unfold you see
[1:18:17] Satan
[1:18:19] knows he knows things and he's going to
[1:18:23] try his best to hinder us to keep us
[1:18:25] from being amen right at the right time
[1:18:29] so when you start seeing it going wrong
[1:18:31] to start saying well praise the Lord
[1:18:34] praise the Lord something's coming
[1:18:35] praise the Lord you know what you'll
[1:18:38] just praise the Lord right into
[1:18:39] whatever's
[1:18:40] coming you see that's that's the way we
[1:18:42] ought to
[1:18:44] do CU it'll always work it has for me
[1:18:48] all of the ministry I've had that's
[1:18:50] worked that when I know the devil's
[1:18:52] fighting it I know that I'm doing
[1:18:54] right if he ain't fighting me I start
[1:18:58] checking that out because I figure
[1:19:01] that's something wrong I've got on his
[1:19:04] side somewhere so I start struggling you
[1:19:08] know see if to call us it's all in a
[1:19:10] Christian Life tell brother fory how
[1:19:12] much you appreciate it amen I just pray

[1:19:31] it's going to be so they can get clothed
