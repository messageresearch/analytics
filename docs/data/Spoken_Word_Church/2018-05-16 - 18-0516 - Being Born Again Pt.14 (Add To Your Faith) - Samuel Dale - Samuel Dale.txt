Lord and no one just bless and take care of that it part and just have your way with each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen [Music] we've been in this scripture now for quite a while but we'll finally get around to the end of it one of these days you know let's just go over to verse twenty-two and twenty-three as we're reading in first Peter says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of the incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now we go over to 2nd Peter now remember what we brought out Sunday though now you say well worried is it that we hear so much about the new birth is the birth of the word well not right there plainly tells you that you're being born again by the incorruptible Word of God which liveth and abideth forever so that that should be enough for you two to know and understand all right now we'll go to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and then a virtue or knowledge you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I pray that maybe some of you miss the Sunday services the morning service there I would ask you if you would to go back and listen to that service because I've listened to it two-and-a-half times so far and you know I had a point trying to get it in mind to each and every one of us all right see the prophet of God now don't misunderstand me and think I'm saying well he didn't do this he knew just listen the prophet of God never came to tell us it was wrong to drink and smoke and Gamble to run around with women and cuss and he didn't have to do that the new birth was supposed to take care of those things we see that we wait and in commercial well I didn't know it was wrong to do that well you know all right the in fact settles it you just you're that far off on your thinking then you know there's no need of even discussing that with you but trying to get a point to you now we didn't consider a lot of things I tried to emphasize that Sunday some of the things that the Prophet said we didn't consider those things maybe we didn't think about those things maybe because we were not told they were wrong by the preachers etc and things like that you know so we went along with those things you know and and you'd be back during the Baptists and I well remember they preached pretty heavily in the 50s and on into 65 and coming on through there with us there was against drinking but there was although you know it's okay to smoke uh-huh we'll see you can say well I didn't know what's wrong do this do that well all right then the Prophet came now you have no excuse so there's no argument about the point the point is that the Prophet didn't have to tell us a lot of things the new birth is supposed to take care of that you don't have to say well give me a quote where the Prophet said is wrong to drink you know that's where you're getting in to the point of just being plumb outlandishly silly because you're to know that with the the way it was and I was what I was trying to get across Sunday because I believe the new birth is the birth of the word that you receive and that birth brings you to as we read of the Prophet to the very divine nature of Almighty God in the basis that it brings the life of Christ within you in the new birth it puts the person of Jesus Christ in you in the new birth and it can be called the divine nature because it's taking away your nature and bringing in his nature cleansing us by that new birth all right then in growth development sure as we go along and we'll get on into this later you know the divine nature of God that it takes all of these virtues to bring in to us the divine nature of God all right so then that should solve the problem that we can look at it and it's look it is like that what we've read being born again now you when you've got the new birth you were being born again it was a process if you were going through through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you were in a process of being which means it's a stage or a journey or something coming all right but then after you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth then you come to the basis of what is it now being born again being born again is a process in the stature of a perfect man all right and that's what we've tried to express and I'm trying to move on into getting the understanding that what we're looking at sea is the stature of a perfect man in 2nd Peter it's not telling you there about you know that you need to be born again that should be settled in the basis of the new birth of faith as we'll get to in a minute and reading some the Prophet had to say all right but it's that is a growth development in the second Peter to try to get us to a place that we need to be in Christ Jesus all right now it'll take those virtues to bring us to the place and people would say well why are we still here and after all these years and a prophet gone because we haven't been taught the correct way the people of the message haven't listened they won't pay attention to what you're saying they just run off with some quote or an idea and I got a quote for this you know and they'll just give you what you can give a quote for anything you want to anything you say I can give you from memory probably a quote from the Prophet that would seem totally opposite from what he's saying all right but that can't be true and see then my point that I've tried to get you to see is a growth development you've got to be born again the born-again experience it takes justification chopping off you PI sins it takes sanctification the unclean spirit being driven out and it's driven out by the word coming and indwelling to drive out that out of your soul now not out of your body and spirit because the Newburg don't take place in the body in spirit it takes place in your soul all right so you drive out that unclean spirit then the Holy Spirit can come in and dwell into our hearts giving us the new birth all right but that makes us babies as the Bible called it desiring the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby that's where the Prophet told it well just reading our minute ago he said that's where you Pentecostals messed up said you thought the new birth was the inner he said that's just the beginning you know the new birth is just the beginning it's not the ending it's not you got everything and it's all settled you know no no it's just the beginning you just got into the family of God by the new birth you just become born again you become a Christian alright see then the Prophet would come along and even all through his life would be teaching things that would sound like that he's contrary one to the other and he talked about the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth is maybe being different you know you said well if you go back and take those things and study them out and listen you'd find out that the new birth is bringing us into the body of Christ justification sanctification baptism with old ago new birth brings us into Christ into the kingdom of God but we're babies alright then the Holy Ghost itself coming to be our very tutor our leader our God and everything to help us grow in the development of Christianity all right and then we'll get back to these more later as we cover it that is a told you over and over Peter and second Peter is telling you how to attain unto where he was this is address to what those that are in Christ Jesus not address to the world not address to everything it's addressed to those that are in Christ Jesus because only those in Christ Jesus can understand what Peter's saying because see Peter would say add to your faith virtue well no I'm a virgin I'm a virgin today so I've got that part straight down well the Prophet he said that ain't gonna do it no that's its wording he said that ain't that's what we think see we get the wrong you understand what I'm saying we get the wrong understanding of things instead of trying to listen to what the Prophet is saying and all of those years he was trying to preach adoption and all of the things to the church to get him to see you know what was taking place to where they could be brought into the family tutored and raised and all like that coming to sonship all right see then it should be a help to you to understand what I've drove for the longest that Peter is telling you how to do this add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and your coming up the statue of a perfect man the growth growth development of Christianity within your being all right Paul comes over and tells you how that you're born into the family and you're just as much of a child as you'll ever be a child and then he's bringing you up through the tutor and the Holy Spirit being the razor and bringing you up to the position of adoption to where God can come on the scene and adopt his own son into the family all right see now to me that's a wonderful thing because that puts all of the Bible and the two main writers I like the way Wade was bringing it out the other day about Paul the Paul wrote the most biggest portion the New Testament you know and I guess Peter wrote maybe basically more than any of the rest of them you know so Peter and Paul is bringing us to trying to get us to see what God wants he wants a dwelling place he wants a body which we are the body of Christ by the new birth he wants that body dedicated to God to live for God and manifest God through the world that they can see and others that can follow in your footsteps all right see then that's what it all comes to bringing us to the the growth development of Christianity huh see then when a prophet would come along and he'd say is I bringing out Sunday you know he'd say ah you get everything you need when you're born again well that's right that's exactly right a baby gets everything it needs when it's born it don't grow no extra parts and limbs and legs whatever it's got everything it just needs a growth development we have the new birth the new birth is the person of Jesus Christ coming and dwelling within our soul to make our soul eternal bringing us his nature his ways and things and in that then that new birth has got everything that we have need of but we need to grow we need to grow up in them as the Bible says alright see then that's what I've been driving at now trying to get you to four months and all driving that point of the new birth and the vital point of seeing what that new birth is alright then we've read it and they emphasize the last couple of messages about words talking about being born again by the incorruptible Word of God so you ought to see the new birth is the birth of the word and it's the incorruptible Word of God that will bring you in I up the stature of a perfect man okay we'll get back to those things later as we going on through the message but I've have reach to put position now to work that we're going to start tonight to looking at the growth development and that's what's wrong with the people of the message like I said Sunday this message is taught to her that it fits the Jews it fits the bride it even goes down and drops low enough to work with I'll use it like that of the foolish virgins and the different things you know all the realms of Christianity is involved in the Bible alright see then bringing all of those things together look we're how you would go off because I've always emphasized this when you talk about the second coming to Jesus cry you got the bride coming across coming out of the church you got him coming for the bride right you got him coming to Israel you got him coming into millennium and then you got his final coming to her that he would come to the Future home all in the second coming of Jesus Christ well then you take a quote from brother Branham and he's talking about the coming of Christ to the Jews and then you read that for yourself let's see you're out because that's not what is talking about to read it though to see that he's talking to the bride then he's not talking about Israel see we need to understand those things and then that way you won't be confused when you're reading in some writers don't understand how come he says easier like I told you about the two brothers I said and talked with one day and one of them said when he got morning in he's adopted he got everything no he said it the other one said well I did four we said of course you don't have nothing he said we just don't have nothing I said would you two guys mind if I stay in the middle cuz I certainly can't go with neither one other games because I know the new birth is eternal life that means you have something so this wouldn't be wrong saying you don't have nothing then this wouldn't be wrong to say you get everything when you believed because that wouldn't work out easy so you stay in the middle and you always and that's always been ever since I've been in this message we have the tapes back there at least - mm - and I probably got my notes I've got Evernote that I've ever sermon I've ever preached so if you want to go back sometimes and sister Johnny said one time said brother they'll let me take those notes you got and put them in to type them in put them in the computer I said well first all you've got all that second off you couldn't read what it said third off you wouldn't understand what was being said because of the way that I am and the way I say things and all you know like that but I've always it's always been since starting this message of knowing and seeing the stature of a perfect man is dealing with a growth development in Jesus Christ after you're born into the family by the new birth that's what it's always been that's that's what I've taught from from the very beginning because that was wet come brother mow preach statue a perfect man in 71 leave us right brother Colley 71 all right so you know it goes away on back you know and I thoroughly enjoyed those days of his teachings on those things all right but see a lot of people differed and says well we don't have this we don't have that that's nothing to me that's between you and God but when you come and tell me I don't have it these are night that does that changes things you tell me I'm not trying to convince nobody of anything I've never tried to convince anybody who I am or where I'm at or what's happening I've tried to preach Christ well but you can see then that would be almost 50 years if I'm say into the 70 71 you know it being 40 something years that I've been teaching the same thing got the tapes to prove it desire to hadn't changed and change this out of the other my change I'll tell you you'll be the first one to know if I miss something changed I've had to correct sometimes yeah I remember one thing I used to I used to think the fusing the theophany you had no feelings whatsoever you know I mean I believed that I believed you didn't have no feelings but then one day I read where the Prophet said you theophany you know you can faithlyn well that change that and you know what I don't I come here and told the church they were I was wrong and what the truth was about it I've always tried to be that away no trying to get it to you to see that I believe Peter was teaching us how to come to work he was which is when you'd look at the pyramid as you'd see where it says brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit there on the pyramid all right now then showing that Peter says will you death he said but you're you're born again at faith and then your growth development is to going on into other thing which brother branham will bring it down and he said Christ coming down through God's Holy Spirit sealing all these things together Christ coming down through God's Holy Spirit see you just go haywire but if you just listened to the Prophet he said that's what it's in the stature of a perfect man I know one time I think it's twice he said I come to build individuals into this stature that's his purpose to build us in the stature alright now you understand what I'm saying about it and I'll get this and get over it see then that he didn't come to tell us what the new birth is that what he didn't have to come and tell us it was wrong to do this and to do that will denote it was wrong to do you didn't have to tell me it was wrong to cause I didn't have to when I come in this message I didn't have to find a whole bunch of things that I've been used to doing and get rid of them he said well you mean you throw school listen I just tell it like it is you're where you want to believe it or not I can go a long ways own if you want tall I never drank me a sinner I never cussed with me a sinner and ever had them bad habits and me a sinner well you believe that or not that's your business but I'm just trying to tell the truth that ain't bragging oh nothing but one thing that's why I believe the way I do that a human being a human being not even a born-again believer a human being has within that human being a soul and that soul motivates that person and it doesn't matter if he's a healer in Africa worshipping idols or if he's any kind of a worse than ancestry the reason that human soul within him is longing out for the God of creation because he that's what happened with me in my Christian life once I met God at 11 years old there's never been a day since then and I didn't want to be more like that that I met I don't have to worry about that I've always told it I believe it I believe the soul the prophet said the soul of an individual what is it really basing it on the best you can want the soul of an individual is really a moral obligation that is within the human element that causes that human element to want to serve God no matter how what you're talking about your God is being there's a desire in there if you won't run around and we'll get into it he talked to me he said Moses had these he said every person born into the world had that same thing every person in the world has a drawing power to pull them pull us to a position if we just listen to it well what do we do we let the things of life we let those thing come and take over now don't you remember back in your early years for you started into a life of doing wrong don't you remember that there was a moral obligation of something within you that you didn't want to go do those things you didn't want to lie you didn't want to cheat and steal the time but you overrode it come on church you put your life there comes that's where my life's always been my life has always been one time an open book I don't well no closed pages in this man's life that's what my wife always says that you you always just tell everything too much that your nun tell I'm just open that's what I was trying to get at Sunday at one time the Prophet didn't have to come to tell us to live good and be good and to quit this and quit that even a moral obligation told you to do that but you claimed most of you claim to have been born again for you heard of the Prophet well then how come that Holy Spirit didn't direct you come on see I get into that and it goes and you you don't like it because you don't like to be talked to that way but I'm truthful and straight and have always been that I believe in being a Christian is the right life hey we all fail don't worry about it well we're about it you're gonna fail anyway cuz why would you to need an advocate why would you need a Savior why would you need a Oh God if if if you wouldn't don't fail you we're gonna do that but we don't have to do it voluntarily and for heaven's sake we don't have to really don't bother me to do that I can't find where the Prophet said it was wrong to drink you didn't need the Prophet to tell you okay I'll get off for Sunday's message all right now think about it so we've been studying now for quite a while about the new birth and the things trying to get it laid down for sure to understand that the new birth is the born to get experience of Jesus Christ to come and live in each one of us to give us his nature and it has to be if we're babes in Christ when we're born again then it's a baby nature what else would you say is there any other way of saying it I don't know because it would be a baby nature it wouldn't God would not expect you to do all of these things where do we get into the statue of a perfect man a little father when brother Ron said look here he said God waited all this way before we have to do this you think he don't understand this he waits all through our life for us to come to a place of understanding all right so didn't listen we become partakers of the divine nature by being born again brought into the family of God by the new birth then we start in that group development in that divine nature as that nature inside of us starts coming back outward into our body and spirit because you're not born to get in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're only born again in your soul all right now see then that becomes to the point that we then begin at the new birth now here's where we're starting tonight so listen we begin in the new birth and that new birth is faith in God right the new birth the birth of the word and we become partakers of his divine nature as the growth development of Christianity into our hearts and lives as we study the Word of God as we pray and we listen to the message you know and and all of those things because listen see then the Prophet didn't have to come to tell us we didn't wasn't supposed to drink again when smoke run around chromatid ultras that he come to give us a message that would bring us back to the faith of the father is that the message of the hour this message is to bring you and I to the divine nature of Almighty God within our human beings we see here is where we're at but I don't see it in you well you know what I always see it in you so now what we got we got a standoff we've got an argument a fuss between and what good is that you don't like my ways I don't like your ways but I've never decrease you not anybody on that basis I never tried to tell nobody they've lost because of their ways that's between you and God I've been totally misunderstood about the rims and the ways that I've took this message and brought it forward to the people but I'll be glad thanks God with what I've tried to bring because I've tried to bring it to a place that this message was to bring you and I to the place that we could have a bodily change that was prophesied in the Bible but was never attained untrue by anyone now you can go back to Enoch but you got a lot to remember with him and the things like that walking off the earth all right but then Church listen Peter tells us in his writing that we've read first one our second Peter verse one through five he's told us over and over that this is written to the church those that are in Christ Jesus all right and trying to tell us how to become into the stature of a perfect man the growth development of Christianity and we'll read in a minute where the Prophet said everything that we have is based up on faith in God all right now what he said everybody here in the building wants to know how to become closer to God he said I guess brother and sister kids about the oldest the tourism and he said everybody said you asked and say their desire in their heart is to be closer to God now if that's not within your heart you need to get a new birth well I'm satisfied where I'm at well that's all right that's between you and God too so you go ahead all right but we're all trying to find out how to come to a place to be AB Wehling place for God to live in right you remember all of those out of the Statue a perfect man and knowing that we must come to that position if we're gonna get out of here if there's going to be a rapture of change things it's not just something that well town's gonna run out no the Bible says there's a time to all things it doesn't say there's a time for all time it says there's a time to all things so then there's got to be a place of position some were that somebody's going to reach the place all right but if it's not talked to the people how can they attain unto go to this serious then put them out for each statue of perfect man that's the question I asked I said now how do I get these how do I get these virtues because if they're necessary then we must have some way well I that's what this prophets message come to bring to do two things restore the faith of the fathers right and then bring the thunders which the revelation containing the seventh seal and it'll be them divinely revealed truths that literally turn us back that's 327 church age we'll read it when you get home but first is to return the faith of the fathers the revelation the faith to the position that the disciples were thrown around instead statue of a perfect man he said those disciples had these virtues uh-huh he said a little bit now before we lose all of it same message he said they didn't have the headstone he said cause the headstone hadn't come yet we said to add these virtues all right he said I come to build individuals into these virtues so the message of the hour is to bring you an eye to the stature of a perfect man where the disciples were that was called the faith of the father's see the faith of the father's is just not to get a new birth that's where you start from but you must grow in grace and knowledge right see until it comes to that he said well brother the way you talk about it that it don't look like it's gonna be a lot of us brother around him you want him he said I doubt it doesnäôt of this generation you want him you want a quote with the Prophet yeah but there's millions following this message today amen he wouldn't be Christian eyes nobody but he said it's a small farm flock right he said what about one out of a state well that puts you to safety what about all the types in the shadows of Enoch one representing the rapture he said well yes you scare me well in order scare us because that's what we'll get back to it on blasphemous names that sister said the way you taught it brother Branham read it blasphemous names over and over cuz we're gonna get back into that said the way that you taught it said there's any way for any of us to have this she was concerned whether she had the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not well yet you just base it upon well I believe the message well she was sitting like they're listening to the messenger she said but the way you're teaching it said it sounds like we don't know see we we want to be come to the dwelling place of Almighty God and to do that would require the new birth to start and the virtues of Almighty God and we won't get to it tonight because we're going to go into it another way but see faith is not a virtue faith is a birth faith is a birth and don't say add two five don't say add faith Peter don't say add faith he said that virtue to your faith faith is a birth virtue is an impartation of the life of God to come into us because of the development of Christianity when I tell you what it is that's what gets me this enriched me to all smithereens as everybody thinks that brother Dale is so deep they can't understand you know what start talking about the new birth and bringing it right down to talking about were you and I were and how God began to deal with us and we could accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and yet you think that's deep how much more simpler can it be gotten you explain what you see everybody I know you just too deep we can't understand no you don't want to understand you won't listen and do like that lady and say Lord do I have the new birth how many of you have searched your soul since we've been preaching about the new birth and thinking about well I wonder whether I have the new birth or not no no go cuz no brother Dale I could never say that in the house a new birth I know I got the new borough how do you know see then we put it on well I believe the message I'll remind you that the shop owner must have been pretty good believers because I stayed with it for three and a half years and they still didn't get it right until Holy Ghost can no that's that true but all right what you see how do we become the dwelling place of Almighty God is because this body physically speaking this body is a body that mankind lives in brother branham's was talking about it or something wait I guess what was about that all this just holds together you know you got flesh and things around and it just keeps that all that stuff in fact and we keep trying to increase it making a bigger place you know all right let's see this body is just a flesh to house what's within us but now physically speaking that will cover it we see then we talk about a house being a tabernacle a building a church or etc or a temple you know and that's well and good but what is the house of God it's the new birth in your soul that is the house of God right you get it that is the house of God is that new birth and that new birth has to have physical things together around to hold it all together until we finish alright and see then we come into that body of Christ by the new birth being born again by the incorruptible Word of God bringing us to that new birth to become a partaker of his divine nature alright we'll get back to this and in a little while but that one the one in order strike you real good where I give it to you the other day on the position of a believer in Christ but a run said after coming into the body we become protected let's get let's start with that where we at I told them we didn't know where we'd start where we're gonna end let's see okay that'll be number eight brothers so if you want bring it up while he's getting there he said what is the tabernacle of God a body God tabernacling in a body all right he said he changes our nature by sending upon us this is from the statue of a perfect man sitting upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we've become a dwelling place for God Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm and the father father and me and I on you you'll know then because you become the dwelling place now look where he takes you this is 1955 this is 62 statue of perfect man look how far back of what he was talking about on the position of a believers that's all in the adoption the believers the position I would invite you to listen to those tapes and things or read on the adoption because we will eventually be into it look at that bruise wounded torn open up his side with a Roman spear in order that by the Holy Spirit we could be baptized into his body protectors of his divine nature you get it then you become a partaker after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature Christ nature in you if you be a protector in Christ and you become a new creature old things passed away and all things have become new divine nature you get the new birth that gives you baby nature of God which is the divine nature of Almighty God to come and live in your soul by the new birth but then I after becoming into the body you become partakers of His divine nature see a growth development a growth development into Christ - were look what he goes on on this one this is all for the the position of them believer roll that back that let's see if we got it no bring that back down or up every which way y'all go okay then you become four take her now listen you become a partaker after coming into his body and particular of his divine nature Christ nature in you how can you cheat still live backslide process must have a price time somebody else tell it I can't everything else with a divine nature of Christ in you how can you do those things with the divine nature of Christ in you it's impossible let that soak just a few minutes kotas right if you be a partaker in Christ then you become a new creature old things has passed away the watch all of our warnings warring excuse me a-- and fussing and stewing and arguing and temper and all of these things pass away did you see it those are the things that god's trying to get us to get rid of he says on the message of the stature of a perfect man paragraph eighty one faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveals it so today we're going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God that and be a living tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in what about he's going to open ok what's it going to turn out to be he goes on over to paragraph 82 I don't think this one's up for them I think it paragraphing 93 and look you say I'm supposed to have virtue it's on a virtue that's what he's saying right here I'm supposed to live gardening this so I'll just have it well brother I've got a that's where we're gonna get to it in a minute Rodale I'll try to live a good Christian live well amen that's good what's the new birth ought to be the other son why you're only trying to place feathers though they're in your reach you can't put the feathers in the wrong bird now you know what he's talking about black birds and the things right now let's just read awhile come on let's pick this up we'll get on go to number 11 statue a perfect man paragraph 94 well that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it see that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it all right first thing you got to do is to be born again you got to be changed we're where we need to be on paragraph 94 do it just go ahead and bring it on up to 94 because that's all right well that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it first thing you got to do is to be born again you got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now now you don't have to worry about the feathers now you know what he's talking about cutting it short what is it he said you can people claim to how this portion of these virtues are not even being born again and he said they do people you met people that are actually people in live good lives etc he said but that's like a black bird you know trying to put peacock feathers in and all kind of changing the birds it won't work you got to be born again alright now look you don't have to worry about the feathers if you get born again right it'll take care of itself when you're born again but you got to be changed you got to change his nature and the rest of him will take care of itself notice you must be born again that is change there's got to be a change but he isn't a Christian until he's born again you're supposed to have read all of these so listen to what he's saying go ahead 90 100 and 101 okay they can't understand it until that man is born again then when he's born again then he's in line of fellowship because he's a new creation that old suspicious doubting character he was is dead now he's a new creation so you see he don't have to add anything to his now because it automatically be added all right now are you following me the first thing to do in the in the statue of a perfect man is to be born again and we'll read it in a minute which is faith how faith and be born again all right then you don't have to worry about it all you got to do it eat look at the 50 years that we've had to study this message why should there be any problem why should they be thousands of different ways of everybody pulling apart in the message they've got one message in fifty years to study it to see if they'd I don't like somebody to stay and say come show me where I've been off fifty years and fathered all these garbage can doctors that you followed oh yeah we've had them here they jumped up and down on the floor and stomped her feet and said gal for this stuff trying to force us to believe this oh yeah we've been through a lot of it go no watch what he says because it'll automatically be added all you got to do is get born again now listen you said well all I gotta do is get born again and they're not everything no because when you get born again you're just in start we're gonna read in a minute that's when you start growing that's when that nature within you is pulling if that nature could be pulling me as a sinner to word it I would repent of the sins that I doing as a sinner and me still a sinner how much more would it be to realize the opening of the word and the studying of the word is to bring the nature of God into you and me and do away with our old nature our old being old parts that we still are comes listen when your first born again as a baby you want me to put it this way this is what I've always preached and always with you know that ever born-again believer new birth eternal life in so born-again believer you know what you start off as a baby now let's see if you agree with this one ever newborn baby is a legalist now you're gonna differ there so go ahead you're a legalist when you first start because you can't be nothing else yeah now you see one of them preachers all they can do stay on legalism that's there better that ain't mine but you know Alling preach on tired and read some clothes and it's nothing you know I'm a firm believer and every bit of it I don't believe you have to be beat to death I believe if you feed a baby it will grow but if you don't feed it right it ain't gonna grow right so is it with a Christian and I want now watch what he says you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith now what's this thing on the Statue of perfect man what does it start with it says add to your faith they don't say add faith now faith is the new birth all right what's he saying you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very foundation faith faith is the foundation of all of it far without faith it's impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it what is sin unbelief so what are you stay back until you get that unbelief out there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one of the other you possess the one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise but first it's got to be faith and let me stay on that foundation for a while now faith faith is what you must believe faith is what faith is the substance of things hoped for it's your if you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith come on faith is the substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11 well what kind of an evidence a holy evidence you might have hope just keep dodging to this and dodging to that but when you got faith you know it because it's the evidence that you've got it okay keep on going because we're just reading it I have a statue of a perfect man that should be what number eleven twelve okay this is just one after the other to read omnipotent omnipresent omniscient infinite that's God so when they make a phone call and say pray that contacts and your faith brings God it's the thing that brings a prayer and God together on the scene prayer faith changes from here to here it brings it together speak on the word and you say the word has everything is right all right faith does the rest of it faith does the rest so you just have faith for a foundation all Christianity oh you are all you'll ever be is the based upon faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word everything is based upon faith so that's why faith is your foundation for the Statue of a perfect man is the word faith because it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen okay go ahead first you've got to be born again and when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it it's if you're just religiously inclined he talks about it should do right would never be able to argue and all I care about and born again it produces faith all right then after you get faith this right here FAI teenage faith then you're just in position of growing and a lot of people go up to the altar and I listen and pray and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification come upon them and things then you have a great time you get up to the altar shouting you go back say bless God I got it no you just started to a place or you can grow remember how much we emphasize on vacation because that's the danger one because you think you're right because you get new desires you get new thoughts new ideas new things you go to church you read you the word you pray you do things he says you're not right yet you just laid the foundation now you're gonna build a house you pour the foundation say boy I got her you got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now all right a house this foundation is for what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the Word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation you begin to add to your foundation now remember when we get started up the pyramid you're going to see the Holy Spirit seals in these things and that's where the trouble is out you say you got faith in virtue and you look on our silver brother Dale I got brotherly kindness you don't know how the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ is right because you're gonna have to wait until each one seals in to get up to that you can't have brotherly kindness before you get all of these other things now that's your prophets words let's see you're not gonna listen to that go read the book I've asked you to read the book huh what is the foundation of they'll try to know okay you're going to build a house now there's where the time these things come in to found out what is the foundation of Christian faith in the Word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation okay quit a little bit one third fall and we jump over to three 3:09 after you come after you doesn't come from here to here to here to here to here to here now now you're coming into the full stature now a son of God but you've got to have this plus all this and you can't even start until you get this and that that a sensible statement you've got to have this and then all that and you can't even start you said well brother Dale I just jump I just wait on y'all I just jump up here brother kindness no you got to have this and then this seals in and this seals in and this seals in and this seals in that sealed in and brother Brown comes up to God on this and he said look you come all this way and look what God required he gets up to godliness and the statue of perfect man he said you come all this way they ain't got to hold a ghost yet you see there's a lot in this message that needs to be understood after you done come through here here here you're coming into the full stature now of a son of God but you got how this plus all this and you can't even start until you get this and remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him don't try to add it to your actually born again I don't care how much you say you got knowledge it's not head knowledge it's holy ghost knowledge well I got brother in the kindness brother Dale if you don't have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness your brotherly kindness is not correct well why can't I have that because God said you can't the Prophet said you can't do this do you get this okay don't try to add it to your actually born again cuz it won't work you can't make it work it comes to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere so you try to say I've got brotherly kindness and you ain't even got virtue or knowledge it'll crumble why because it's not sealed in all these things have got to be vulcanized sealed in and you seal them in one at the time you don't seal something way up to top and then wait and see if something down to bottom and seal some you know you gotta have faith for the warning and experience to seal you in the body of Christ then virtue has to seal you in to Christ before you can talk about Holy Ghost knowledge I wish I could ride back through the mountains that I rode years ago that was going over to brother Ben Howard's and the Lord began to deal with me about faith virtue and all these tempers and I could see how each one was a further development of the ones before you see you got faith in virtue that's the only way you'll ever come to Holy Ghost knowledge is to have faith in virtually as Holy Ghost faith and virtue you never come to brotherly kindness until you come up the statue of a perfect man there's where it's been so much talk and people don't listen they don't listen to the profit you get downs you know genuine born-again dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you comes on up all right coming into perfection man all right what about it coming on into perfection what about it Church do we have the new birth do we have the new birth let's go to 132 come back to that one number thirteen would be 132 paragraph 132 they come back to number 13 now a lot of people go up to the altar and pray and that's where he says you know they come out shout and he go back see bless God I got it no you started to a place to where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you doing is just laid the foundation now you're gonna build a house you pour the foundation you got to build it they're older don't know you talk about it now all right watch what he say it a house this foundation is first what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the Word of God what does it come out to add faith to your virtue listen to this one go ahead we'll get number fourteen then we're gonna pick up real quick fourteen I think we've done been through it but after you come from here to here to here to here here you're coming into full stature son of God but you gotta have this plus all this and you can't even start until you get this why because what are you doing you're like a bird a black bird with a peacock feather calling and saying I got it there's no need of trying to say what you got the best thing to do is try to get it and find out how to get it and then go that way right know whether who was it was it brother would be used to make that statement he said you've got to go where the fellows got to stuff you know if you want dope you got to go to where the fellows got to stuff right that truth if you want Christianity you got to go to the fellows got the word well brother Dale do you think you're the only one ain't never said that never will say that why would you say it because I spent my life I have given over fifty years of my life to studying the Word of God and all people can get out of it is you're thinking you're some intellectual something I can't help it if God has given me what he'd give me but neither will I deny what he's giving me either I'll stand on it until we pass away this message is right it don't need nobody to interpret it it needs somebody to believe it and accept it and move on all right you come to a dwelling place that's why you find scrap seats of ministers of Christians piled along the way now that's what he's done we find the scrap heaps piled along the way is because they didn't go into it right that's paragraph 139 statue of perfect man that's why I'm here this morning paragraph 140 is to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God and they would like to be that the dwelling place and here is what we do you got it up and here is what we do what's the first thing we have faith and be born again let's lay in the foundation then after you lay it lay the foundation secondly add to your foundation add to your faith Peter said here add to Europe first you have faith then you add virture to your faith this is the next column first pour your foundation faith then to your faith add virtue now remember there to be automatically added so get to start with a with a faith all right now right here we're knocks a lot of us down yes sir add virtue to your faith that doesn't mean living a virgin life the adverts are doesn't mean to live a virgin life you know like the manner of the woman and so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with that virgin life do you know what the definition for the word the definition in a statue of a perfect man for the word faith there's two times listed our faith our virtue excuse me it means of virtuous now listen to the difference listen to what the man is saying the world thinks virtue means a virgin life it ain't got a thing to do with a virgin life virgin life don't mean you're a Christian right to be a virgin doesn't mean you're a Christian why would your prophet say that because he knew what that other definition listen to the definition of the word virtue it means a virtuous course of thought now listen we're going to give you this definition then brother Branham is going to give you his understanding because he pulls over the word virtue and takes it to Luke and talks about power there's brother Brandon believing a virtuous life but he knows a virgin it didn't make no difference I don't mean your Christian cause you a virgin right means you're a Christian whether you're born again or not so then what is the word virtue in the statute of perfect man are the Peter that we read a virtuous course of thought feeling and action means virtue means moral goodness any particular moral excellency as modesty and purity you say well that's that's not the Virgin that's not just being a virgin that's being a virtuous Christian come on you don't have to be a virgin to be a virtuous Christian no don't tie it all together the virtuous Christian is one who has what praiseworthy a virtuous course of thought the brother Branham says in a minute we're going to read it he said you've got to have virtue and a pice for it to go out now what is the Pais for it to go out the life you live before others is the Pais that lets virtue go out for others to see it right but a virgin a virtuous life a life lived in Christ is the greatest soul-winning thing that there is Oh we'll get into it in a minute where the Prophet says yeah I said that's the reason said they see you in church acting like a Christian oh you're a good Christian here you don't Dyer dress and act and talk and everything here like you do at home or out somewheres I haven't well you know the people out there is once looking at you that's why I love the Bible I remember this in the Baptist Church you know that to be a deacon we think he's supposed to have this this or this is it you know what the Bible says about a deacon sure all of those are right supposed to be the husband one wife he's poor bill but you know what it mainly said of a good report of them that are with out her to set up a deacon we're not supposed to go among the congregation and ask them what they think of him we're supposed to go to the neighbors around it and see it and where he works at and think a good report of them that are without the Bible say okay virtue the Prophet said it's not just being a virgin but he knew it was to be a virtuous life because all Christianity's be based upon a virtuous life not a virgin life a virtuous life a life that Christ is within you living back out that others can say and want to act like you I told you I worked with these two women in a job that I had it we work side by side 24 hours a day I mean eight-hour today and one day his sister our lady she got a little upset and begin to say something I said you want gonna be talking like that that's what I understand I said I have my problems too she said Sam I worked with you you're in you're out said I've never seen you with a down expression maybe she didn't live close enough to me but that's alright but listen okay now we're going to go ahead because I got this I want to keep this right here to where we get to it but the words word virtue in Peter comes to the basis of a virtuous life in other words a life lived in Christ with moral goodness goodness and thing and a procurer moral in excellency as modesty and purity but a random rule were going to read it in a minute where he says strength is what it's talking about as a virtue there and he said strength is like in Luke you remember in Luke where it said virtue went out mark and Luke both talked of the virtue that went out we think it and it was now listen it was that he got weak but that wasn't it was what caused him to get weak don't go with just being weak because you can run a five-mile footrace and you're gonna be weak that ain't got nothing to do with what he's talking about but look that one that's used in this in the statute of a perfect manner in Peter is using that then in Luke it's using doing the must this means power like dynamite basically power mighty work strength miracle my virtue my strength power ability in hurt power power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature or which is a person or thing exerts and put forth power for performing miracles moral power and excellency of so the power and influence which belong to riches and wealth don't get tetanus on it belongs with power and resources arising from numbers power consisting in our resting upon like armies or it forces our host something to back it up so now listen I want to get this one and then we're gonna do about two and they'll quit do we say the Bible say it or he's just that it doesn't just mean living a virgin life you know I look like a woman or a man it doesn't just mean that it means the living a virtuous life a life in Christ right nothing to do with that part nothing to do with it the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him that right congregation says amen if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him is the first song that I ever loved in the hems one of the greatest words to be like Jesus well if I'm going to be like Jesus I got to have virtue and a pice that it can Pais forward from me to the people what did they see in Jesus oh they didn't agree with him about the first season as ever but what did they see a man going about raising the dead healing the sick casting out Devils feeding the people had a good virtuous life didn't it that drawed power or strength to them that needed it now listen because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if somebody tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds see no no none the arts are draw from check balance somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner are you listening not much virtue can be drawn from that remember you got out of the virtue but a pice come on virtue must be in us until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith true virtue you understand it that's the next foundation wall first you must have faith faith alone won't do it you got Peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith come on then it might be the reason you don't have it because many churches of today teach you don't have to have it are the days of it is past you don't have to have it only thing you have to do is just join church your days of spice now how many sermons that are preached then it's not this you come to church the new birth is not you come to church you come to the altar you cry and you pray and you say you're saved how many sermons did a preach on that how many hours have we spent into what he's saying about it many churches of today teach you don't have to have it are the days of it is past you don't have to have it only thing you have to do is just join church it days is past virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means seeing we must have it if virtue went out from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtually to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength or power then watching because he's going back to Luke with it right some of them don't even believe in the power of God they say that's pious only thing you got to do is just put your name on the book and be sprinkled report or baptize or whatever more and that's all you have to do how many sermons did I preach what you needed to do as a Christian how you needed to get born again that's because of that statement look Peter says here add virtue and Peter's talking about building the house of see the temple of God fixing it to a place and after you have virtue you must have after you have faith you must have virtue with it that's right how virtue for the whole world what does it mean to do with this virtue that it drugs it gives it how you remember the lily it makes a beautiful shot for that admirer it opens up itself for honey and the beaze coming to see it you remember what we read up there a moment ago the run says you've got to have virtue and a pice for it to come out what is the pious it's your life living before others what about it your life living before others they can see that and they can draw virtue have you ever witnessed the Prophet in what he said did he get weak have you ever witnessed that have you ever witnessed the Lord Jesus getting weak have you ever witnessed that have you ever had it to happen to you that because of something and all you get weak I'm on you ever had it better brother McGarity come up here to be prayed for one time and he asked me to pray for him about something that was bothering him I prayed for him and I held his hands and prayed for him and I knew he didn't get it so what did I do the Bible says remember that the man they prayed for you know that they took him and held him until strength came in his body brother McGarity began to just fall away I got a decent amount of strength he was a little bit of guy which I was proud of at that time but as he began to just fall away I just took his hands and I just lifted him up and I held him and we kept praying after a while he was standing on his own two feet and I turned him loose because I had literally picked him up virtually almost in midair to hold him because I knew he didn't get it and he needed something but when I felt that from him pulling to me then I knew there was a saddle product I don't tell that for nothing but the honor and glory of God your you ought to be able to tell in your Christian experience something in your life where you've had things like that have you ever had something to just come to you you knew that was it that was settled it's finished there's no matter what anybody else said it was finished you ever been that way have you ever prayed until you got weak and praying you know I mean you just literally got weak that was what happened to the Lord Jesus when strength went out of him all right he got weak strength went out of it but was it all together strength of her might or was it God pulling upon his gift was God and brother branham when he said he'd pray until he could just these have set him down virtue went out of it but you know what while that virtue went out of caused the people that come to that meeting come expecting right they knew he had virtue and a pice what was brother Branham his pice the life he lived for a profit to make this statement was outstanding to me he says I have lived so close to God until it forced the gift to operate you hear that he said I live so close to God it forced a gift to work that man had a lot of Indian life he had the statue of a perfect man he had the virtues and he knew what they were he said I'm trying to tell you what they are and not only that would tell you how to get them like I said and I've said it many times 3:27 church age book tells you how to get the faith of the father 327 church age book tells you how to get the virtues and what did he say this messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father that's what he came for to bring that part right but then he come to bring his messages because the faith of the fathers was not brother branham's message no more than it was his message to try to tell us how we need to live right that was the Christian experience from the Bible the disciples had these virtues and they had the staff they had the point to wear that the faith of the fathers dwelt within those apostles and they taught others how to come to the place they were that was in the word lorentz message he said didn't begin until the opening of the word of the seals he said not in the years of preparation and all he said but when he begins to silent that goes into the part to love what I said any he'll reveal those seven thunders which are the revelation contained in the seven seals it'll be these Ravalli reveal mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back but everybody's afraid to talk about thunder seals this that or the other they're scared I'll be scared when I'm saying what he said I might not be able to produce it but let me at least talk about it let me at least tell you I'll talk about it contain concern about arresting see it doesn't matter to me what happens in this individual but it means a lot to understand what will happen to you if I don't bring you the truth and I'll do anything I can to try to get you to see the word I've done it for 40 something years preached to you never backed off from anything and never allowed you to fall off into doctrines and ideas that some even would move a little bit and I'd say haha that's not right this is not right here that's that's not right become an enemy to a lot of people because that I would try to tell the church the truth not to get you to act like me but to get you to become a Christian read statue of a perfect man the Prophet said he came to teach us how to become into that stature of a perfect man well then why can't we believe that's what's supposed to be taking place it'll be these divinely revealed mystery twos that literally turn our hearts back why are we afraid of the Word of God I hope you follow me and understand what I'm talking about you can take words and twist everything into any direction you want to go when a prophet was like I said want to go he would say that he said virtue is not living a virgin life he wasn't against living a virgin life but he was against telling people that a virgin life was what was going to make you physical virgin life is wonderful honourable commendable praise God but it is not Christianity Christianity is the new birth the birth of the Word of God which would then make us sons and daughters of a living God in the virtuous Christian of a statue of a perfect man why are we still here because the people don't want to believe and put our whole being in to what the Prophet has to say then we have an excuse with well I don't really know you don't know you don't know what it is really day of God I don't know what it is he died and took it with him I ain't gonna argue with you about him dying taking it with I'm gonna argue with you at all but if he died and took you with him then evidently we don't need it so I ain't worried about it right what I'm concerned with is what we need the statue of a perfect man is what we need we need these virtues to be brought in to us by the opening of the word how else are they going to come in agent you say I need versus others have it that's a peacock and the Buzzard flirt feathers or something put into it but when we look straight at God's Word and take God's Word and believe what he says and he'll add what we have need of he'll add the things that we have need of because we stay with the foundation but we come up to the basis go musician we come up to the basis or saying well I don't know about this don't know see that's what the Prophet said we get into knowledge you'll be coming up in a couple of messages you'll see that's what he says we don't believe God's Word now listen Church please for months I've tried to get you to see what the new burner really is the birth of the word not trying to decrease the NIH's anybody but to get us away from the ideas and opinions of what we used to have that we based our Christianity up on I don't cut my heart I don't paint my face I don't do this I don't do that I don't do try
