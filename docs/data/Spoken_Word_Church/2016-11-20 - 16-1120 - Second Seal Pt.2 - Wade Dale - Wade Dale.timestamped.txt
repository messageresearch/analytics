[0:00] oh Lord y'all remember to clean floor
[0:04] today okay we'll leave that alone we
[0:06] won't even worry about that today how
[0:07] about
[0:13] that Bob picture is
[0:27] Ting all right you do you brother
[0:30] that's right what
[0:32] you today we're starting on the second
[0:35] seal all
[0:37] right and uh well we kind of reviewed it
[0:41] last week but let's
[0:45] read chapter
[0:47] 6 verse 1 through 2 is what the first
[0:52] seal verse three and
[0:54] 4 is the second seal so the feel like a
[0:59] miss and something I guess it's that
[1:01] thing um that's on so the horse
[1:04] rider the
[1:06] man yeah I don't we're not turning it on
[1:09] we're not going to use it it we take 5
[1:11] minutes for it to boot back up the horse
[1:14] rider gets off of this horse all right
[1:17] same
[1:19] person but what he's going to do he's
[1:20] going to change his
[1:22] power his horse horse is a power that's
[1:25] not a physical horse right horse is a
[1:28] power all right so he's going to get off
[1:29] of that first Power why because he
[1:31] started that power and that power
[1:34] continues
[1:36] M which was a what a saying in the
[1:39] people's mind a saying that went out
[1:43] that Jesus was a light substance of God
[1:45] not these sub of God basically same old
[1:48] Doctrine that's in the message
[1:50] today and like brother Dale said last
[1:53] last week or Wednesday night if you
[1:54] don't think so ask somebody of some of
[1:57] the major people that that preach it
[1:59] yeah they believe that he was just a man
[2:01] walked just like me and you walked
[2:03] around that's why I can't
[2:05] understand this is what I don't
[2:07] understand this is what's so
[2:10] silly they say that you and I and I say
[2:13] they some of the big people in the
[2:16] message say that you and I will come
[2:18] here with eternal life in our soul right
[2:21] that's a major doctrine that you know
[2:23] you come here with eternal life in your
[2:24] soul but Jesus
[2:26] did yeah doesn't make sense
[2:31] I can't put one in one don't make two on
[2:33] that one one in one makes about five or
[2:35] six or something see that's an error
[2:37] that's an error that was a saying right
[2:42] become a deed and then it become a
[2:43] Doctrine cuz once you preach something
[2:45] it's a Doctrine and that power goes into
[2:48] the people cuz remember the devil's
[2:51] nothing without me and you giving him
[2:53] some power we give him the power to do
[2:56] the things he does but yeah that always
[2:57] stunned me that that they preach so hard
[3:00] that you and I were born with eternal
[3:01] life but Jesus was born just a man and
[3:03] received eternal life on the River
[3:04] Jordan I think they got it backwards
[3:06] somewhere you knowly and you say well I
[3:08] got these quotes I was telling y'all the
[3:10] other night the essence of the message
[3:12] doesn't say that the essence the the
[3:15] essence of the Bible and the message
[3:16] coming together shows you that the Bible
[3:19] says he was born Emmanuel God With Us he
[3:23] wasn't born the second person of a
[3:24] trinity in him dwelt the fullness of the
[3:26] godhead bodly see so you see other
[3:28] people they take so well he's like the
[3:30] the guy did about him being a third of
[3:32] God that he wasn't the fullness well see
[3:33] he's denying scripture that horse that
[3:37] Rider has been so
[3:40] instilled we we went last night to a
[3:42] concert and and U into a Baptist
[3:45] Church and those people are really
[3:47] sincere I mean they're really sincere
[3:49] they were raising their hands and
[3:50] praising God but uh scripturally they
[3:54] they're they're wrong so so what do you
[3:56] do you do the best you can yes the life
[4:00] in front of them do the best you can but
[4:02] what they're deceived that horse rider
[4:03] got on them denominational horses and
[4:05] rode and has not quit
[4:08] riding right uh we're going to tie this
[4:11] in with the Book of James James says
[4:13] when lust is conceived bre for sin When
[4:16] sin is finished brings forth death okay
[4:20] so that's the same way with these four
[4:21] horse riders when you begin the second
[4:24] the third and the fourth all right so
[4:26] we're going to bring tting together with
[4:28] the book of James is showing that the
[4:30] horse riders are all a
[4:35] deception there is nothing truth in that
[4:39] man getting on the horse
[4:42] except about
[4:45] 99% well that kind of shocked you didn't
[4:50] it and only ones at the end time
[4:53] is soose so close remember so
[4:56] close he's not 99% wrong or he would
[4:59] have a horse to ride on this is my point
[5:03] he wouldn't have a horse to ride if he
[5:04] Satan's not that he's dumb but he's not
[5:07] that dumb okay okay he he he's got to
[5:10] get it so close to it looks the same
[5:13] right right that's the deception the
[5:16] deception is not that that he's in the
[5:19] world and you know the smoking the
[5:20] drinking the cussing the running around
[5:22] and all that stuff that's the world
[5:24] that's right that's that's the that's
[5:26] the devil's he's already got them so
[5:27] he's working on what he's working on the
[5:29] religious
[5:31] people see that's who he works through
[5:33] that's right I hate to say that but he
[5:35] works through religious people and he
[5:37] can to a degree work through Christians
[5:41] right
[5:41] hello right he can work through
[5:45] Christians and I'm not doing that for my
[5:46] ear my ear
[5:48] itches okay but he
[5:51] does so this is why these horse riders
[5:54] were so deceiving yet we got to see
[5:56] underneath all that though that God's
[5:58] working first he always works first all
[6:02] right he always works first you got to
[6:04] remember that you say well this person
[6:06] doing this that's fine that's symbols
[6:08] That's what Satan is doing through a
[6:10] group of people but underneath there
[6:12] there's a group of people that gets a
[6:14] revelation of the first seal which is
[6:16] the line bold line of the tribe of Judah
[6:19] justification in one true and living
[6:22] God all right that's what Satan don't
[6:24] want you to say listen if he can get you
[6:27] to doubt your experience
[6:31] this is this is this is this has been
[6:33] something that I've been studying for a
[6:34] little
[6:36] while because we go back and we and it's
[6:38] hard to do because we're human we go
[6:40] back and we say God I am so sorry for
[6:43] what I
[6:45] did 20 years ago
[6:47] right and God's up there going what are
[6:49] you talking
[6:51] about yeah I mean honestly if he puts
[6:55] your sins now go back to the Bible the
[6:56] Bible's lying if God doesn't put that in
[6:59] the sea of forgetfulness never he can he
[7:02] that's one thing God can do he can never
[7:04] remember that again that's right but you
[7:06] and I what and the rer brings it back
[7:09] up and then I like that song what SS are
[7:12] you talking about you're sitting there
[7:13] going Lord I did this I did that forget
[7:15] that sure it's going to come back to
[7:17] your memory sure you going but just say
[7:19] Lord thank you for bringing me from one
[7:21] place to another
[7:24] place that old man that did that is dead
[7:29] right not divorced if you if he's
[7:32] divorced then you got a problem you you
[7:35] keep bringing it back up and if it's not
[7:36] if it's not dead that's why that I you
[7:38] know I love marriage and divorce pretty
[7:40] straight you know if your husband's not
[7:41] dead or your wife's not dead you can't
[7:43] marri again right why would you want you
[7:46] know that's
[7:47] like the denominational World think
[7:49] they're married to God I hate to say
[7:52] that but it's what the prophet said but
[7:54] they married the devil like brother Dell
[7:56] said you can say Jesus Jesus and be
[7:57] calling on the devil right
[8:01] I mean that's truth that's right that's
[8:03] how the deception is that's why we had
[8:04] to have a Prophet come in the end time
[8:06] to pull that thing apart so we could see
[8:08] because we were so close to it it was so
[8:10] ingrained in our in our psyche it was so
[8:14] what preached to us
[8:16] right indoctrinated
[8:18] us but now we're going to see that that
[8:21] this first part under justification
[8:24] that's done away with but we're going to
[8:26] see the second seal we're going to talk
[8:28] about a blood that not just cover
[8:31] sin we're going to talk about a blood
[8:33] that eradicates
[8:38] sin and the real you didn't do
[8:41] it that's what we have to see to get to
[8:44] take a body change you really going to
[8:45] have to say it right cuz what hurts us
[8:48] condemnation right right well I thought
[8:51] Romans 8 said there's therefore now Paul
[8:52] said 2000 years ago there's therefore
[8:55] now no condemnation but you know what
[8:57] that's got to be a revelation that's
[8:58] right right it's not not been revealed
[9:00] to us 100% that one scripture that's
[9:03] right
[9:07] MH there is therefore now Paul was
[9:09] bringing you know if he didn't say well
[9:10] if he just said well if there's there's
[9:13] therefore no condemnation he said
[9:14] there's therefore now now once you're in
[9:17] Christ Jesus there should be known you
[9:19] say oh I get condemned every day that's
[9:20] fine but who does the condemning it's
[9:22] not God condemning you that's right
[9:25] right it's your past and the things that
[9:28] you do in the human that we live in and
[9:31] we do have to repent every day but you
[9:34] don't have to repent for what you did 20
[9:36] years ago if you really truly repented
[9:39] and you're born again that's the
[9:41] problem if you're not really born again
[9:43] those sins are just heaping right back
[9:45] on you again that's true right that's
[9:48] the difference in the justification that
[9:49] we're talking about in the seals that
[9:52] that the that it's as if you never done
[9:54] it then we're heading toward the real
[9:56] you didn't never do it right you going
[9:59] to have to see right here that that that
[10:02] that it that you know you did it but you
[10:04] know you're redeemed right in this part
[10:07] of you're going to have to see that that
[10:09] real you didn't do it right that's true
[10:12] that's why I can't understand the people
[10:13] in the message that preach that we are
[10:15] we had eternal life in our soul the
[10:17] things I did in my previous like like
[10:21] they always say BC before Christ all
[10:24] right before Christ the things I did
[10:26] there was no way the Holy Ghost resided
[10:28] in my my soul that's right no way that's
[10:31] right cuz God won't dwell in an unclean
[10:33] vessel he will not that's right right he
[10:37] will not dwell in an unclean vessel so
[10:39] not dwelling in an unclean vessel but
[10:41] what is redemption is taking that man
[10:43] that fell that soul that
[10:47] fell because of Adam and Eve
[10:49] transgression we were born in sin shaper
[10:50] in iniquity that person that fell now
[10:53] can be picked back up to what the level
[10:56] that God did see you before the
[10:57] foundation of world and I believe with
[10:59] all my heart that if you're a born again
[11:01] Christian today that God give you a
[11:03] special Angel when you were
[11:05] born to lead you and guide you cuz what
[11:08] he knew the end from the beginning so he
[11:11] knew where he was going to meet you at
[11:13] and he knew that you were going to come
[11:15] to this place and so he had it there
[11:17] where was it at it's in
[11:22] here you must be born from above well
[11:24] this word didn't come from man down here
[11:26] on the ground that's right this came
[11:29] from God Almighty from heaven above so
[11:32] this is where you born from
[11:35] amen so same way with the seals we
[11:39] we I have to scratch my head because
[11:41] sometimes you explaining things you make
[11:44] people think I don't want us to think we
[11:45] got greasy Grace going on but there is
[11:48] come to a point to where you got to
[11:49] stand just like Jesus did and said I am
[11:52] my father one who can condemn me of sin
[11:56] now he was born of he was so much man
[11:58] though to they thought thought he was
[11:59] number one that thought I was looking at
[12:01] it the other day cuz I'm reading Matthew
[12:02] Mark Luke and John like brother Dale
[12:03] said read all right and you look in
[12:06] there you know what I read Mark the
[12:08] other morning and it was that I had
[12:10] never read the book of Mark before the
[12:12] chapter of Mark I got to read nothing
[12:14] I'm
[12:15] like man this a new Bible Well you know
[12:18] it becomes one when you enter into a
[12:20] different realm you start reading it
[12:23] different cuz it it does start out
[12:25] Matthew I mean Mark starts out Jesus
[12:27] Christ the son of God we see that that's
[12:29] the Revelation that you're supposed to
[12:30] get the church is built on the Son of
[12:32] God
[12:33] Revelation but you and I have been
[12:35] commissioned to be like the astronaut
[12:37] get up off of the earth and get into the
[12:40] realm of the son of man which is God in
[12:42] human flesh that's the part they really
[12:44] miss with the God standing there they
[12:46] said he was a wine bibber well guess
[12:48] what Jesus must have drank a lot of wine
[12:50] now they don't get drunk over there like
[12:51] we you know you we drink a couple of
[12:53] wine and we fall over silly it's like
[12:55] Germans Germans drink beer like we drink
[12:57] tea so they drink a case of beer and
[12:59] it's like us drinking three gallons of
[13:01] tea so you see your body but see they
[13:03] saw him so much with with publicans
[13:06] Sinners you know what a Publican is you
[13:09] ever looked that word up my heaven
[13:12] people we say it all the time tax
[13:14] collector oh okay they hated them people
[13:18] yeah that's right they hat and they
[13:20] would go to the house like the IRS that
[13:22] we have now they would go to the house
[13:24] to collect taxes that's why they hate
[13:26] them that's why the publicans and siners
[13:28] were pushed over to the side
[13:29] nobody liked them they weren't they
[13:32] weren't lawmakers and like we say well
[13:35] they were the no they were just Tax
[13:37] Collectors they were told by the
[13:38] government that Bob owed you know taxes
[13:41] and they would go try to collect those
[13:43] taxes nobody liked them so they were
[13:45] over to the side with the
[13:46] cers yep Matthew was a Publican Matthew
[13:49] was a tax collector yes he was and um
[13:53] and I'm sure they were shocked when he
[13:55] changed his life around some but still I
[13:57] mean if you're a tax collector you're a
[13:58] tax collector but they were all pushed
[14:00] to one side and Jesus was sitting there
[14:03] ministering to
[14:05] them leaving the socalled religious
[14:08] world alone except for to condemn them
[14:12] every time he go in the
[14:16] temple you
[14:20] finished share but
[14:23] you that's why I'm up
[14:25] here I'm up here to
[14:27] talk you got come chair
[14:30] now yeah I just talking about the
[14:32] Republicans Republican not the
[14:35] Republican no one of the reasons they
[14:37] were hated so much is because they were
[14:40] they done
[14:41] everything they were not honest in what
[14:43] they doing they just didn't collect
[14:45] taxes they ripped people off and they
[14:47] became Rich that's correct because what
[14:50] they collected was what they paid the
[14:52] Govern and then
[14:53] they and Jesus was around that I mean so
[14:57] you see that how they how they pre what
[15:00] he say preconceived idea of who Jesus
[15:02] was supposed to be he wasn't remember
[15:05] they said cus oh he you know the Messiah
[15:08] come right up to cus and say oh great
[15:10] cus no he came up and told cus who he
[15:13] was and where he come from but what I'm
[15:15] saying is is back to the point the point
[15:17] is you and I are going to have to have
[15:20] to go to if we if we know that that man
[15:23] that walked on the shores of Galilee was
[15:25] God Almighty in human
[15:26] flesh the Holy Ghost That was in him
[15:29] that was not just in him was a part of
[15:31] him right right that's right comes back
[15:34] into the believer at the new birth then
[15:38] like I told you before many many many
[15:40] many many many years ago you read the
[15:42] things that I do shall you do also but
[15:45] we got to start believing that right
[15:46] that's right the things I do what did he
[15:48] do he got up every morning he didn't
[15:49] have to say he was God he knew he was
[15:51] God he knew that he had a purpose now
[15:53] sure the outside man had a purpose for
[15:55] death right brother Dale covered that
[15:57] real good cuz you got to step to he was
[15:59] the Lamb of God that took away the sin
[16:00] of the world Lamb of God is the only
[16:02] thing that can bleed that's right the
[16:04] Son of God can't bleed the Son of God
[16:05] can't die same way with
[16:07] you you can
[16:10] bleed but you can't die if you're born
[16:12] again right you can't die so you've got
[16:15] that part right what we got to do is
[16:16] start working on the outside part and
[16:18] that's what these seals are is to show
[16:20] us number one the
[16:22] opposition what punch he has what punch
[16:25] he's got coming and to be ready when he
[16:28] brings that punish and you say you just
[16:30] do like Jesus what Jesus do Jesus didn't
[16:33] destroy the Devil and he didn't destroy
[16:35] he
[16:36] said the word
[16:39] says scripture says it is
[16:43] written that's why just it just came to
[16:46] me that's why he got to be son of man
[16:48] again because he had to be flesh to be
[16:50] able to die that's right that's why we
[16:52] that's why that in Matthew
[16:56] 17 he said tell the vision of the one
[16:58] until the son of man be risen again son
[17:01] of man died 2,000 years ago he rose the
[17:04] Son of God ascended and was a Son of God
[17:06] through seven Church ages all right but
[17:10] for a moment it's like brother Dale said
[17:11] and i' had never seen that before that's
[17:13] why I that's why I keep coming back
[17:16] Serv sometimes it's the only
[17:19] reason no really you ought to come here
[17:21] just to listen to what what the Lord
[17:24] says through our pastor that's right but
[17:26] when he
[17:27] said and he brought that in that that he
[17:30] had to die son of man right then that
[17:34] was that was the whole purpose of that
[17:38] sacrifice was to take away the old
[17:40] sacrifice of the blood of bulls and
[17:42] goats because the blood of bulls and
[17:44] goats cannot take away sin Satan can't
[17:47] take away sin their sin could only be
[17:50] covered that's right is or cap of what
[17:53] they covered sin can only be covered so
[17:55] it was still there right right right but
[17:58] when Christ come his blood had life in
[18:01] it that could come back in me and you
[18:03] right that's right the the blood of
[18:05] that's why the that's why the um animals
[18:08] I don't know why I'm going this way but
[18:09] I'm going this way anyway that's why the
[18:10] blood of the animal had no
[18:14] soul right in
[18:16] it so that the blood the life that was
[18:19] in that animal couldn't come back into
[18:21] the believer Jesus had to become the son
[18:23] of man to bleed and die to give us life
[18:28] right that was already in him to release
[18:30] that life to bring it back into you and
[18:31] I right so that's why it's the Son of
[18:33] God first revelation is the Son of God
[18:37] God indwelling your soul and you're born
[18:41] again Christian but now it says
[18:44] television no one till son of man be
[18:45] risen again well they killed him 2,000
[18:48] years ago but what's happened now
[18:50] spiritually though through these ages
[18:52] and through these riters they killed him
[18:55] again they didn't kill him they killed
[18:56] the effect what they done is they buried
[18:58] him
[18:59] M they buried the Revelation yes mhm
[19:03] amen they buried that Revelation during
[19:05] the church ages and now like brother
[19:08] Dale said I'll get back to my point now
[19:09] where brother Dale said there's no
[19:10] promise of the Son of God coming back
[19:12] there is no promise there's no promise
[19:14] of a Son of God coming
[19:16] back it never left
[19:19] right sure only I mean he was here 3040
[19:23] days okay as the son of man and Son of
[19:26] God all power in heaven and earth been
[19:27] given unto me when he ascended just a
[19:31] few days later right and come to the day
[19:34] of Pentecost 50 only 10 or 11 days after
[19:36] his Ascension he comes back in the Holy
[19:39] Ghost okay right so the Son of God
[19:42] really never left the place right right
[19:45] the son of man's the one that left and
[19:47] the son of man's the one's got to come
[19:48] back because it's it's required in the
[19:51] scripture as it was in the days of Noah
[19:53] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[19:54] be in the coming of the son of man there
[19:57] is no uh the Son of God who doesn't have
[19:59] to come it never left the revelation of
[20:02] the Son of God never left the Earth
[20:04] never it's been on Earth Listen Hold on
[20:07] what that's the new birth stand for
[20:10] that's correct but you got to remember
[20:11] the Son of God wasn't 2,000 years ago
[20:15] right the Son of God was a Creator God
[20:18] right way back before time so he's all
[20:20] been way back before we think let he
[20:23] come on earth right no he was the son of
[20:25] God he he was the son of God when he
[20:27] walked in front of of and I mean Adam
[20:29] and
[20:30] Eve that's what brother Brown said he
[20:33] said that was the Loos that created
[20:35] everything was the son of God so the Son
[20:37] of God Revelation is back into eternity
[20:40] and it really never changes it just
[20:41] keeps going cuz
[20:43] remember it's God above ush sure he
[20:46] dropped down in time to be God With Us
[20:48] is Jesus he come back though he just
[20:51] went up just for a little while come
[20:52] straight back down and it's been Son of
[20:54] God down through seven Church ages but
[20:56] to take a body change and to fulfill
[20:58] scripture the son of man has to come
[20:59] back to the Earth but he can't come back
[21:01] because look he's barred by scripture
[21:03] his feet can't hit the earth until the
[21:05] millennial reign as the son of David to
[21:09] the Jews is that all right okay and
[21:12] who's who's got to bring him
[21:14] back he's got a horse to
[21:22] ride remember Revelations 19 it shows
[21:25] him coming back on a what white horse
[21:28] and many followed behind him and I don't
[21:31] think they were walking or riding on
[21:33] birds I think they were riding their
[21:35] White Horse amen amen right that's why I
[21:39] don't like that statement somebody say
[21:40] get off your high horse or there your
[21:41] white horse or all that stuff you
[21:44] crazy but when he opened the second seal
[21:48] I heard the second beast say come and
[21:49] see and there went out another horse so
[21:51] it's a different horse it's not the same
[21:52] hor different
[21:54] horse right that was read and power was
[21:58] given to him that sat thereon to take
[22:02] peace from the
[22:04] earth so what's it going to be it's
[22:05] going to be some kind of some kind of
[22:07] something that's going to take peace
[22:08] from the earth and that they should kill
[22:11] one
[22:12] another does Satan actually kill
[22:17] you Satan listen Satan cannot come down
[22:20] as a physical being and kill you that's
[22:23] right God can that's right that's right
[22:26] All Souls are mind he can bring it he
[22:28] can take it out
[22:30] amen but Satan can't do that what he
[22:34] gets into you enough and you do
[22:40] it come
[22:43] on do you think you die in human flesh
[22:45] and God did
[22:50] that no God's not God has no death in
[22:53] him at all how do you think to people's
[22:56] judgment what's he going to do to
[22:57] people's judgment I said you should he's
[23:00] going to stand up there in judgment he's
[23:02] going to have the word of God and all
[23:03] the bride behind him and they're going
[23:05] to condemn their
[23:07] self they're going to know that they did
[23:10] wrong right amen amen the devil made me
[23:15] do it no I I'm like Daddy I I agree 100%
[23:19] most of the time I'm the one that does
[23:21] it now he may suggest it that's right
[23:24] but I'm the one that does it cuz
[23:27] remember Satan has no power how can he
[23:30] how can he be a force to reckon with
[23:33] when the Bible says he's going to be
[23:34] like a drunk on the side of the road how
[23:35] can be a force to reckon with when we're
[23:37] all walking in the Millennium and he's
[23:39] still alive and you're not he's not
[23:41] going to be down there in a chain like
[23:43] you know the Bible say he'd be chained
[23:45] up in the bottomless
[23:46] pit he ain't going to be chained up you
[23:49] know what he's going to be he's going to
[23:51] be a man standing with no power
[23:54] yes he's just going to have to stand
[23:56] still because you know what he tried to
[23:58] go out and do something it's going to be
[24:00] cut off see that's what happened in the
[24:03] garden cuz remember Satan and God both
[24:05] was in the Garden of
[24:07] Eden it wasn't just God and then the
[24:09] devil came on down somewhere no they
[24:11] were together the whole time Satan
[24:14] finally figured
[24:16] out a way to get into the human race
[24:19] right he knew that creation was Creative
[24:23] Evolution not Evolution Creative
[24:26] Evolution and that whatever that Beast
[24:28] was he could either flop over to the
[24:30] man's side or back to the animal side
[24:33] and he said there's where I can get in
[24:35] and he what he went right for it right
[24:37] but remember he had to use somebody to
[24:40] do it he couldn't create somebody to do
[24:42] it that's right he had to use a beast
[24:44] that had no
[24:46] soul you'll get that in the little B do
[24:49] like my cousin Terry Dale said he told a
[24:51] joke last night nobody laughed he said
[24:52] you'll get that when you go
[24:55] home so anyway there went out another
[24:57] horse that was red now what does red
[25:00] signify
[25:01] blood uh what does red signify something
[25:04] killed
[25:06] kill they should kill one another s
[25:08] that's I said when when people go to
[25:11] war the devil doesn't kill people people
[25:14] kill people that's right but the
[25:15] motivation of the devil that's right is
[25:17] that they're in opposition with each
[25:19] other and they're going to kill each
[25:20] other okay so and I think what's going
[25:22] to happen is if you'll see these at
[25:24] least the four with the four be standing
[25:26] here you're going to see that Satan
[25:27] really has no power
[25:30] he motivates you to do his work right
[25:35] you say well God does the same thing I
[25:37] differ with you and the point that
[25:40] brother brandham says when God enters
[25:42] you that's God's
[25:46] hand there's a big difference there but
[25:48] it's really only about that
[25:50] th because Satan does the same thing if
[25:53] he he if he enters if he enters into a
[25:55] person and and uses them as Satan's hand
[25:57] but if God enters in and uses you that's
[26:00] God's hand but Satan the only problem
[26:02] with Satan is he cannot ever use it for
[26:04] good it can look good for a while but he
[26:06] never can carry it all the way out right
[26:08] there's a lot of good people in this
[26:10] world that's right but if they're not
[26:11] born again they're going to hell that's
[26:12] just the bottom line that's right are
[26:15] are be given eternal life you understand
[26:17] what I'm saying but they cannot be God
[26:19] in human flesh on the earth unless
[26:20] you're born again through justification
[26:23] sanctification the baptism of Holy
[26:25] Ghost that's not a law that's what's
[26:27] written in the
[26:28] that's true
[26:30] right so the horse is red we saw too
[26:35] that it was I need to put red up here
[26:38] just kind of keep your little bullet
[26:40] points red and red signifies
[26:45] blood all
[26:47] right and we're going to also see as
[26:49] this develops we're going to go up a
[26:50] little early cuz the kids are going to
[26:51] have a program what is what is the blood
[26:54] of God what does it do it didn't it
[26:57] didn't cover
[26:59] sin it took it
[27:02] away put in the sea of God's forgiveness
[27:04] never to be remembered again that's
[27:06] right that's
[27:07] sanctification sanctification is readed
[27:10] all right so we're going to we're going
[27:11] to go through this justification
[27:13] sanctification those who is Justified
[27:15] he's already glorified white what you
[27:19] start becoming white in justification
[27:23] right and you know what if you say God
[27:26] forgive me of my sins and you die in his
[27:28] eyes you are white you going to be given
[27:29] eternal life
[27:32] right I you white robes were given I
[27:35] like that but I want to mine down here
[27:38] you know I want mine down here that way
[27:40] I'm safe when I go anywhere
[27:42] else right I don't want have to go
[27:44] somewhere to get a white
[27:46] robe because what the Bible says the
[27:48] white robe is what the righteousness of
[27:50] the Saints are we going to just wait
[27:51] till we get righteous that's what the
[27:52] people in the denominational World well
[27:54] one day we going to get a new body and
[27:56] we going to be good no you better be
[27:57] good here
[27:58] right you better do what the Bible says
[28:00] here you ain't going to be no there to
[28:02] you all right that's why you see these
[28:04] seals we're talking about simple
[28:06] salvation brother R said don't ever
[28:08] leave that same simple message of
[28:11] Salvation even in the
[28:14] apex of the message of the hour or what
[28:17] God's brought the son of man Ministry
[28:18] what did he come to
[28:20] do he tells you if you going if you read
[28:22] Matthew Mark Luke and John you hear he
[28:24] said he come to what seek and save those
[28:26] who were lost
[28:28] this one bottom line yeah right then all
[28:32] these other benefits see we can tack on
[28:34] to it because we're at the end time when
[28:35] the son of man is rising again or has
[28:37] risen again into the hearts of people
[28:40] and then then you are God made manifest
[28:43] in another form on the earth called a
[28:45] bride right cuz all the other ones have
[28:48] dead they died went on right and they
[28:51] went out another horse that was red and
[28:52] power was given him that sat there on to
[28:54] take peace from the earth and they
[28:55] should kill one another who's they the
[28:57] people on the Earth all right this is a
[28:59] literal seal this is when this we went
[29:02] through the first three ages Ty the
[29:04] first seal right MH all right the next
[29:07] Church age is the tharan church age this
[29:10] is the longest age and it's called the
[29:12] Catholic age because the Catholics
[29:14] killed 68
[29:16] million Protestants protesting that's
[29:19] why they call it protesting yes
[29:21] protesting the Roman Catholic Church 68
[29:24] million in their own books read Fox's
[29:27] Book of Mark if you can get through it I
[29:29] couldn't so I just quit reading it what
[29:31] they did to people in the name of
[29:33] religion and that Demon's not dead he's
[29:35] right still back here now
[29:38] right cuz you know like brother R said
[29:40] he said you know Thou shalt not
[29:43] kill well you don't have to physically
[29:45] kill somebody to be committing to be
[29:47] committing murder right belittling
[29:50] someone doing you're you're killing
[29:52] their influence you kill the person
[29:54] right that they should kill one another
[29:56] and there was given unto him a great
[29:58] sword all right so in other words now he
[30:00] has a word he has an
[30:04] indoctrination and you know you say well
[30:06] it's Catholic Church well the Catholic
[30:07] church is the beginning of it all but
[30:09] Baptist Methodist Pentecostals and all
[30:11] that in the same boat right
[30:14] organizational religion is in the same
[30:17] boat all
[30:19] right he was given a great sword not
[30:21] just a sword he's given a great sword
[30:23] why because everything's going to be
[30:24] real
[30:26] close and so close now till it would
[30:28] deceive the very elect if it were
[30:31] possible right right all right so now
[30:33] let's go to
[30:38] Matthew
[30:43] 20 and
[30:48] let's tell you what I'm going to read it
[30:50] out of here you can read it on on the
[30:52] thing I'm going to read it here cuz I
[30:53] think I got a comment or two in my in my
[30:58] this one the battery never runs out of
[30:59] it
[31:01] so I like that too yeah the batter you
[31:04] don't have to
[31:06] mash never have to reset it either this
[31:09] thing right here you have to reset every
[31:10] once in a while this one now you don't
[31:11] have to reset that all right can't find
[31:14] Matthew in Revelation brother Brown said
[31:16] that the other day I was listen or
[31:18] reading a book somewhere he said well I
[31:20] can't find Corinthians in Colossians he
[31:22] was in Corinthian oh he made a mistake
[31:28] all
[31:29] right now for many shall come in my name
[31:33] and shall deceive many got that that was
[31:35] the first seal right that was the first
[31:38] seal a
[31:41] deceiver second seal is this and you
[31:43] shall hear of Wars wars and rumors what
[31:46] does the war do kill there's never been
[31:49] a war
[31:51] fought even between a husband and a wife
[31:53] that they weren in a little blood shed
[31:55] somewhere I'll get you to wake up cuz
[31:58] some of you off into the Land of
[32:00] Nod remember C's the only one that went
[32:03] to nod first all right but you shall
[32:05] hear of wars and rumors of
[32:07] wars what kill let me tell you let me do
[32:11] this right here let me bring Revelation
[32:13] back will it was so neat how the how the
[32:17] Lord showed brother
[32:20] random how these seals compared with
[32:22] Matthew 24 all right horse was red and
[32:26] power was given in selling to take what
[32:27] take peace from the earth if there's
[32:30] peace there's peace if there's war
[32:32] there's no
[32:33] peace right peace from and they should
[32:36] kill one another and there was given
[32:38] unto him a great sword second seal and
[32:41] ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[32:43] see that ye be not
[32:47] troubled you see the Waring in the
[32:49] message and the Waring around the world
[32:51] physically and spiritually be not
[32:53] troubled for all these things must come
[32:56] to pass but but the end is not
[32:59] yet okay this is not the war to end all
[33:01] wars right there will come a time of a
[33:04] war that'll end all wars and I'm talking
[33:06] about spiritual and
[33:08] physical but there is a time when this
[33:10] War's got to be over right what's we
[33:12] Waring at in our flesh in our members in
[33:14] our in our spiritual realm right that's
[33:17] the war that we fight now the next one
[33:19] coming down is the third
[33:23] seal all right so we won't read it here
[33:25] in Matthew 24 for it says for Nations
[33:27] shall rise against nation and Kingdom
[33:29] against Kingdom and I wrote Satan and
[33:31] God so it's both kingom there's only two
[33:33] kingdoms in the world there's not a
[33:36] Grecian and a and a Roman and a there's
[33:41] only two kingdoms right Satan's kingdom
[33:43] and God's kingdom that's only two
[33:45] there's no gray area so you know you you
[33:47] either fighting for one and against the
[33:50] other or for this one and against this
[33:51] one you're always at
[33:54] War it's like Paul said I mean like U
[33:57] yeah Paul it said I have a Waring in my
[33:59] members what the things I would not I do
[34:01] the things I do I would not right that's
[34:03] iniquity you know better than to do it
[34:05] and you do it anyway and we do it all
[34:06] the time but there's an advocate that
[34:09] we've got to look back to and not see
[34:11] that he has crawled on the cross and
[34:13] throw his blood out again he died once
[34:17] for all the Bible says one time for
[34:20] every sin on the face of this Earth he
[34:22] died one time and he does not have to
[34:23] die again that's right now man has
[34:26] killed him his influence man has buried
[34:29] that son of man
[34:31] Revelation but it was Satan riding
[34:33] through the men to do it and women yeah
[34:36] right right but the Catholic Church
[34:38] killed 68 million Protestants that's why
[34:41] you call it Protestants protesters the
[34:43] only problem is is now the Protestants
[34:45] have become the the um the horse
[34:48] daughter and given power cuz the only
[34:51] thing look the only doctrine that
[34:53] Catholics and and and Protestants really
[34:55] have is like brother R said the the U
[34:58] communion okay communion Ro um Catholic
[35:02] Church says that when you give the I
[35:03] mean it's kind of silly but look what
[35:06] they've done they've indoctrinated that
[35:08] when you take that wafer and put it in
[35:10] your mouth now remember you don't get to
[35:12] drink the wine that's right the priest
[35:14] drinks wine that's why they're all
[35:15] drunks I mean honestly why they do the
[35:17] things they do but they put it in their
[35:19] mouth and that turns into the Flesh of
[35:22] God now that's what they teach yeah and
[35:24] that he drinks the wine symbolizing the
[35:26] blood keep him clean so he can keep you
[35:29] clean well that's not true at all but
[35:32] you look at the denominational World
[35:34] they they taken uh it's just a piece of
[35:37] cracker and there's no symbolism at all
[35:39] so you're going to see how the two's
[35:41] going to come
[35:42] together they'll compromise on that and
[35:44] then they'll all become
[35:46] one but we got to see these seals and
[35:48] get out of here because once that starts
[35:51] boiling that's when me and you are going
[35:53] to be persecuted that's when me and you
[35:54] are going to be stopped from doing
[35:55] things that we can do now we're free
[35:57] country to do what we want to thank God
[35:59] for Thanksgiving yes but there's a great
[36:02] Thanksgiving feast that we're going to
[36:05] and it ain't going to be in this
[36:06] Dimension but we got to get there first
[36:09] so let's
[36:13] go remember Tuesday night we have church
