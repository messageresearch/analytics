[10:58] the spirit of Christ Christ which was in
[10:59] them and signify when it testified
[11:02] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[11:04] the glory that should follow unto whom
[11:07] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[11:10] but unto us they did Minister the things
[11:12] which are now reported unto you by them
[11:15] that have preached the gospel unto you
[11:18] by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven
[11:21] which things the Angels desire to look
[11:23] into wherefore G up the loins of your
[11:26] mind and be sober and hope to the end
[11:27] for the grace that is to be brought to

[11:34] you may be seated the Lord had his
[11:36] Blessing we had a a u word sent into us
[11:40] that we need to pray uh that brother uh
[11:45] Royal
[11:47] Serano uh the flooding is in the
[11:49] Philippines real bad and there's some
[11:51] pictures back there that it says it
[11:53] actually the first floor of his home and
[11:55] I'm 99% sure I've been there when I saw
[11:58] the picture
[11:59] and the bottom floor of his home is
[12:01] totally flooded and uh so it's raining
[12:05] real bad there you know and all and and
[12:07] they're here and cannot contact their
[12:09] two daughters so just pray that the Lord
[12:12] will move the rain out and make
[12:13] everything you know be okay they' say
[12:16] they've already had over 50 casualties
[12:19] in the last 2 or 3 days from the strong
[12:21] rain so remember that the Lord would
[12:24] would be with with them and take care of
[12:26] them amen right now
[12:30] we've tried to bring things down Sunday
[12:32] afternoon to kind of a uh show you an
[12:36] overall view of what we're talking about
[12:42] and all and you know kind of line up
[12:44] some things to where we can move on a
[12:46] little bit and you
[12:49] know I want to make sure tonight we're
[12:52] not going to use any I may quote a good
[12:54] bit but we're not going to use any
[12:55] quotes we want to just go with the
[12:57] service and try to to speak without
[13:00] having to uh pull up a bunch of quotes
[13:03] and things but to get you to see what
[13:06] we're talking about amen all right now
[13:09] we went through in our studies of
[13:11] Revelations 4 and brought it over to the
[13:15] place you know then to go into now into
[13:17] chapter five and going into chapter five
[13:22] we have found some things to be there to
[13:26] help us to understand that's right and
[13:28] and I pray that the Lord would would
[13:31] would open their eyes to one thing now
[13:34] it's it's you know I've gotten some
[13:36] comments back so I know that most people
[13:39] haven't never maybe thought of the
[13:41] situation that I brought out there
[13:43] Sunday morning in the afternoon service
[13:46] right of the book
[13:48] being written and then sealed up right
[13:52] because most everybody wants to try to
[13:54] break it open it see it you know
[13:57] understand it but if you wasn't here I
[14:00] ask you to please listen to the morning
[14:03] and the evening service this past Sunday
[14:05] all right but see the book is sealed
[14:09] amen right the prophet said you're
[14:11] sealed with the book right right amen
[14:14] now you say well how do it sealed now
[14:16] now there's some things about this book
[14:18] this Bible that we're holding up that's
[14:21] that man was able to be able to read and
[14:24] understand like the Fai of the fathers
[14:26] the writing of the word Etc but then the
[14:30] Book of Revelations comes into view and
[14:33] it just kind of seals up the book right
[14:36] to where that you you've got to have an
[14:38] understanding then of a sealed book
[14:41] right a lot now if you'll notice in your
[14:43] reading we'll get to it in a few minutes
[14:46] uh in three places in chapter 5 alone it
[14:50] speaks of a sealed book you know and
[14:54] chapter 5 we know is to be already the
[14:56] bride in glory after the WAP rure amen
[14:59] right Y and the book is still sealed
[15:02] right see because you've got to get that
[15:05] understanding to be able to walk into
[15:08] the rest of the scriptures all right but
[15:10] see the book is sealed you say yes but
[15:13] but uh you know and I said there are
[15:16] some parts of the book that was not what
[15:19] you call sealed up right y but just
[15:23] remember
[15:25] that the Bible is sealed to unbeliever
[15:29] right amen right that's right that's
[15:31] right y all right do you you follow that
[15:34] amen it takes a baptism of the Holy
[15:37] Ghost to be able to understand the Bible
[15:40] right now you can read you can study it
[15:43] that's fine and we do that but the Holy
[15:47] Spirit has to reveal amen and we're
[15:50] talking about the revelation of Jesus
[15:52] Christ and see then we know that the
[15:55] Bible said just paraphrase it that no
[15:57] man can call Jesus the Christ
[15:59] you know the Christ accept it be by what
[16:02] right by the baptism of the holy spirit
[16:05] all right see because you can't
[16:09] understand you can't see the book you
[16:11] see can't see the kingdom of God without
[16:14] the new birth right amen all right so
[16:16] it's sealed up now so remember now the
[16:20] book is sealed up the that mankind can't
[16:23] read this Bible that's right and
[16:26] understand it right amen
[16:29] because it's sealed until you get the
[16:31] Holy
[16:33] Spirit now also remember this and keep
[16:36] it in your mind I'll repeat it in a
[16:38] minute but see until this time there in
[16:43] Corinthians the Bible says that there's
[16:45] a blindness over Israel's eyes right
[16:48] amen that they cannot see it's over
[16:51] their heart really right because they
[16:54] can't see
[16:56] it right and see that's what we're
[16:58] talking
[17:00] about see then we begin to talk about in
[17:03] The Book of
[17:05] Revelations you don't see the book in
[17:07] chapter 4 you see one on the throne You
[17:10] See Redemption you see all the things
[17:12] and the bride goes up in Revelations
[17:14] 41 not seen until 1921 right you know
[17:18] coming back all right the rest is to
[17:23] Israel see then that's the point we're
[17:25] trying to get across to you to be able
[17:27] to see
[17:29] but you see you the book is sealed am
[17:32] and we gave it to you paragraph like 75
[17:35] of the seal book the book is sealed and
[17:38] you're sealed with the book amen
[17:40] right see you're the book
[17:44] right see we're not talking about the
[17:47] one that's in the hand of the one on the
[17:48] throne is
[17:50] not a scull field thps and chain or
[17:53] whatever Bible right amen the book in
[17:56] the hand of the one sitting on the
[17:57] throne
[17:59] we' read it to you the prophet there's
[18:01] nothing in it but a book of names amen
[18:05] right see it's a book of names because
[18:07] it was the names that was written on the
[18:09] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[18:11] foundation of the world Amen right so
[18:13] it's just names written in that book
[18:15] amen all right but see then when we came
[18:18] to Earth then this Bible
[18:21] here is The Book of Life right amen
[18:25] because this Bible here then tells what
[18:28] going on on Earth while that name is
[18:32] being made manifest that was in the
[18:34] Lamb's Book of Life Amen brother said
[18:37] arm and Neville is not written in the
[18:40] Bible but he said what's going on on
[18:42] Earth while arm and Nevil is here right
[18:45] he said that puts him right in the word
[18:47] amen right all right see then we don't
[18:50] look in the word to try to find our
[18:52] names
[18:54] right we look into the word to see
[18:56] what's going on man yes
[18:58] all right now the emphasis I've been
[19:01] trying to make for quite a while is one
[19:06] thing that book that you
[19:09] are is not completed yet no that's right
[19:15] amen well because we're not completely
[19:17] yet right right right right am see we're
[19:23] in the journey amen we're in the
[19:26] process all right now being in the
[19:28] process being in the Journey the book is
[19:30] being written ye are written Epistles
[19:33] Paul said known and read of all
[19:37] man but see when you come to the Book of
[19:40] Revelation chap 5 the bride's already
[19:43] gone up to glory in chapter 4 right
[19:46] right so she's already become the
[19:51] book she's already become a Britain
[19:54] epistle that's right she's already
[19:56] become a live word that's what we're
[19:58] doing right now
[20:00] right is receiving the word of God and
[20:03] becoming that word just as we eat and
[20:07] become the food that we
[20:10] eat and see then looking at it
[20:15] then see we are
[20:18] sealed the world can look at you and
[20:20] they can say to the about the sisters
[20:22] and they say well you know you're
[20:24] different right you look like the word
[20:27] all right right but still they can't see
[20:29] him right
[20:31] right you remember brother R saying said
[20:33] you can't see me
[20:35] right he said you see the body I inhabit
[20:39] right but you can't see me
[20:42] right now so is it that I said a moment
[20:44] ago then that we are that
[20:47] book amen you're a walking book right
[20:51] you're a living book amen the book is
[20:54] now being written about you and I amen
[20:56] there's things in this Bible that's not
[20:58] fulfilled yet you agree right amen all
[21:02] right now if it's written in this book
[21:05] by somebody by prophecy like Paul said
[21:08] we be changed the moment the twinkle an
[21:09] eye now that hadn't taken place yet
[21:12] right right if it has you and I missed
[21:14] it all
[21:16] right but see it's not taking place yet
[21:19] all right so then the book is not
[21:25] complete all right man see now the book
[21:29] I'm talking about Adam didn't have a
[21:32] Bible in his
[21:35] hand we were doing Pary and my wife and
[21:38] I were talking about these things and
[21:41] she helps me to try to get me to back to
[21:44] the CH the chain of thinking and what we
[21:46] ought to bring out and you know and I
[21:48] appreciate
[21:49] that you see Adam never had a Bible in
[21:52] his
[21:53] hand he didn't have a book in his hand
[21:56] no right
[22:00] but he didn't have a book he didn't have
[22:02] the the lounge Book of Life holding it
[22:04] in his hands no no but what he had was
[22:10] was the ability to bring forth all of
[22:13] those names amen right yes
[22:16] sir right right and had he not sin not
[22:21] entered the
[22:23] picture that's right we would have come
[22:25] spoken word children amen and only the
[22:28] names It Was Written in the lamb Book of
[22:30] Life would have been all that would have
[22:31] come right
[22:35] right but but because that we didn't go
[22:38] that way and send into picture then
[22:41] there's a lot more names going to be
[22:43] involved and then a book had to be
[22:45] starting to be written y right according
[22:48] to the Book of Daniel according to the
[22:49] Book of Revelation it calls them books
[22:51] right Prophet says there's even a book
[22:53] about your life right but this Bible
[22:56] tells us enough about our life right
[22:58] right that's right see this Bible has
[23:01] covered every age and
[23:03] time that will ever be upon the Earth is
[23:06] written right here in this Bible amen
[23:09] all
[23:10] right but that's the Book of Life man to
[23:14] show you what you're doing or a record
[23:17] of what you're
[23:18] doing and it recorded on the day of
[23:21] Pentecost that the baptism of the Holy
[23:23] Ghost came and how many received that
[23:27] what were they their names had to be on
[23:29] that L's Book of Life right right but
[23:32] it's not that Adam was sitting with the
[23:33] book and lost it he lost the ability for
[23:37] it to come forth amen and God had to
[23:39] take it back right all right and brother
[23:44] around said then we see him sitting here
[23:47] with that book in his hand amen so the
[23:50] book that I'm talking about is in the
[23:51] hand of the one sitting on the throne in
[23:53] Revelations 51 right it's not a Bible
[23:57] you can call it a Bible because it's the
[23:59] book of
[24:01] life but it's a record of those
[24:04] names
[24:06] right that would receive Jesus Christ as
[24:09] their savior amen amen but it's not a
[24:11] record of the Jews it's not a record of
[24:14] the of the foolish virgins M and the
[24:18] thing it's only a record of those names
[24:20] is only the bride
[24:23] right see then when Jesus Christ paid
[24:26] the price
[24:29] then he went to the throne
[24:32] right all
[24:34] right you remember we went through
[24:36] chapter
[24:38] 4 he raised up and went to the throne
[24:42] amen all right brother said climbed up
[24:45] on the throne and set down in other
[24:48] words became the one on the throne amen
[24:50] that's what happened at
[24:53] Calvary but he didn't claim The
[24:56] Possession that's right on the entire
[24:58] being at Calvary
[25:00] right he only claimed the possession of
[25:03] the soul of the
[25:05] individual
[25:07] amen all right now he's not going to
[25:10] have to get back up on the throne and
[25:12] die again to claim the rest of us he
[25:14] paid the price amen it just wasn't made
[25:17] manifest at that time
[25:21] right see then what started
[25:25] was it started on Earth y just like I
[25:29] said a moment ago no man can see the
[25:31] kingdom the kingdom of God is the
[25:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost into our
[25:34] hearts and lives right
[25:36] amen all right be in that Kingdom when
[25:40] you and I came into that Kingdom by the
[25:42] new
[25:43] birth that brought that name that was
[25:46] before the foundation of the
[25:49] world it made it manifest on earth
[25:53] right might not be
[25:56] G Atkins or crany want
[26:01] right because it's their name that was
[26:03] written before the foundation of the
[26:04] world
[26:06] right but there's a manifestation on
[26:09] Earth of that individual see both of
[26:12] them the in are made manifest here on
[26:15] Earth and accepting the new
[26:17] birth then God's predestination would
[26:21] catch up with you
[26:23] right and see then you would be here in
[26:26] as a born again believer
[26:29] right that's the writing of the book
[26:34] amen see until all of those
[26:37] names in that L's Book of Life have been
[26:41] made manifest upon
[26:43] Earth in individuals who have received
[26:46] the new
[26:51] birth then the book is not complete
[26:55] amen I gave you quotes over and over
[26:58] where the Prophet would say when the
[26:59] book is
[27:01] completed you know what happens to the
[27:04] book it's sealed up that's right
[27:09] amen so if you can
[27:12] see that people can't even see you
[27:16] that's right they see the body you
[27:17] inhabit they see your life your actions
[27:20] your doings and that's why it's so
[27:21] important yep how we live
[27:24] amen all right but they can't see that
[27:28] Christ in you because that Pharisee was
[27:31] just as
[27:31] religious
[27:34] sure as to look upon him the Pharisee
[27:37] would have been more religious of what
[27:40] we think of religion than what Jesus was
[27:43] even sure
[27:46] right but we know that what was it he
[27:48] was an actor right amen word Pharisee
[27:52] actor see all
[27:55] right but you see once that last name
[27:58] comes in here on
[28:02] Earth and is made manifest by the new
[28:05] birth you understand what I'm saying not
[28:07] just because it comes on earth right but
[28:10] it's got to receive the new birth amen
[28:13] all right and when it does the book is
[28:15] completed
[28:19] right and it's sealed
[28:24] up because what I want you to think
[28:26] about
[28:28] the statements brother R made that we
[28:30] sometimes
[28:32] don't you know honor them as much as I
[28:34] think as we need to but brother R said
[28:37] here in Revelations 5 he said the book
[28:40] is
[28:40] closed amen that's
[28:43] right he said we didn't know it was a
[28:45] seal
[28:47] book that's what he said I said the seal
[28:49] I gave it to you he said we didn't know
[28:51] it was a sealed
[28:53] book he said but we found it's a sealed
[28:56] book
[28:58] the book is sealed up it's not open
[29:00] until chapter n chapter 10 you find him
[29:03] with a book in his hand open you don't
[29:06] find him in chapter 5 with that book
[29:08] open why
[29:14] right because this book in Revelations 5
[29:17] is
[29:21] you and you're sealed up just like
[29:23] you're sealed up here but they can't see
[29:26] it right m they can see the life that
[29:28] you manifest
[29:31] yeah but they can't see Christ right
[29:34] unless the Holy Ghost comes through that
[29:37] person to make Christ manifest right
[29:40] right so then the books got to be sealed
[29:43] why because it's got to go to Israel as
[29:45] a sealed book right right come
[29:49] on yep that's right sure Israel at this
[29:52] time the book is seed
[29:54] amen right yep they can't see Jesus
[29:57] Jesus Christ right right they know all
[29:59] about him sure they could probably tell
[30:03] you more about him in a lot of things
[30:05] than even the lot of the religious world
[30:07] that claim to be
[30:11] Christians but in doing
[30:14] that see it's sealed up right you are
[30:19] the book right that I've been talking
[30:22] about in the hand of the one sitting on
[30:23] the throne cuz you don't see the book in
[30:25] chapter 4 I went through that over it
[30:27] and over it
[30:28] amen you see the throne and one on the
[30:31] throne the elders and the the rainbow
[30:34] and the things showing the Rapture has
[30:36] taken place
[30:38] right but you don't see the book in the
[30:40] hand of the one sitting on the throne in
[30:42] chapter 4
[30:44] right it's in chapter 5 right why
[30:48] because he's fixing to take that book
[30:53] amen and he's going to preach you to
[30:55] Israel amen amen I don't see why people
[30:58] can't see that that's right amen we're
[31:01] not going to Israel as I've said some
[31:03] even believe that we're going to go to
[31:04] Israel ourselves some in the message say
[31:07] a gentile prophet and a gentile bride
[31:09] you know of course I knew the brother
[31:11] meant he was the Gentile Prophet but it
[31:14] didn't make no difference I didn't
[31:15] believe we're not going to get up the
[31:17] plane fly to Israel and then go out to
[31:19] Rapture and we ain't going to fly up and
[31:21] go over and go down you know and no
[31:25] no but this man
[31:27] message which is the Bible amen right
[31:31] you agree brother R's message is the
[31:33] Bible this message will go to Israel
[31:37] this book will go to Israel not a not a
[31:39] book like this right but they will tell
[31:43] Israel right right you rejected the
[31:47] right of sunship
[31:51] right you would not receive Jesus Christ
[31:56] as your savior right we said the
[31:58] Gentiles
[31:59] did and they have this whole New
[32:04] Testament now is written that you can
[32:06] read what they done right
[32:11] yes and they can tell us that and they
[32:14] went in the
[32:16] Rapture and you rejected the right of
[32:21] sunship I was looking at something today
[32:23] cuz my wife will remember this I told
[32:25] her I said there something something
[32:27] somebody
[32:30] said about him singing a new song and I
[32:32] couldn't get that
[32:36] straight now I know where it's
[32:39] at see in Revelations five the bride
[32:43] sings a new song
[32:45] right but in Revelation 14 Israel sings
[32:49] a new song after they're redeemed sure
[32:53] absolutely amen about 143 I think it is
[32:56] I knew it was somewh word and I couldn't
[32:57] place it and I kept searching then all
[33:00] at once it appears yeah all right see we
[33:04] sing a new song
[33:06] Amen you say yeah but we've always sung
[33:08] the song of redemption that's right but
[33:11] our song of
[33:13] redemption if you ever noticed your
[33:17] songs notice your song
[33:22] books Charles Wesley and them all wrote
[33:25] the songs right during that period of
[33:26] time
[33:27] a lot of people that time you know there
[33:29] was written about the
[33:30] blood is that
[33:33] right why because that was what being
[33:35] was being
[33:36] preached it was being preached so strong
[33:40] until they believed you were saved by
[33:43] the blood right
[33:46] yeah there's no way to be saved by the
[33:48] blood cuz the chemistry can't be
[33:50] applied you're saved by the life that's
[33:52] in the blood right amen but you see
[33:55] there are songs actually sing those song
[33:57] We sang them right here I know it was
[34:00] the blood I know it was the
[34:03] blood and it were written in the time of
[34:05] the
[34:06] blood right they was being preached of
[34:12] sanctification ausa Street
[34:15] struck right what is the
[34:18] songs one of them now that may come on
[34:21] down later in our day but just get my
[34:23] idea of what what I'm
[34:24] saying they wrote songs about about the
[34:27] Oneness of the godhead right after isus
[34:30] the street that's right y cuz that was
[34:34] the
[34:35] message that was being
[34:37] preached what are the songs now written
[34:40] by the people of the bride of Christ
[34:43] beautiful
[34:45] songs of the
[34:47] token of the different things what
[34:50] because it's the hour amen even the song
[34:54] shows the time that we're at right amen
[34:57] are you are you following me
[34:59] amen see but we're going to sing a new
[35:01] song
[35:04] Amen you said we just want to sing the
[35:07] songs of redemption now we're going to
[35:09] sing a new song
[35:12] yeah we'll get through that in a minute
[35:14] we're going to sing a new
[35:17] song not something different
[35:21] right but a song related to where we
[35:25] at then when we leave out of here
[35:28] Israel will sing a new
[35:34] song but be real careful the way you
[35:37] place
[35:38] it CU we sang the new song that thou H
[35:41] has made us Kings and Priests right
[35:44] under our God
[35:45] Amen Israel sings only thou Hast
[35:49] redeemed us right I get time I'll get to
[35:52] that scripture in a minute it's on over
[35:54] the message to show you the difference I
[35:57] don't get to it you read uh Revelations
[36:00] 59 and 10 and then you read Revelation
[36:04] 141 through about three they sing a new
[36:07] song Amen y because you see they can't
[36:10] sing the song of Salvation like that
[36:14] that's right they can sing only the song
[36:16] of
[36:17] redemption you say what the same no it's
[36:22] not Redemption can be a a a why why
[36:27] thrown
[36:29] judgment foolish virgin is redeemed one
[36:32] day but she can't sing the song of
[36:35] redemption that we can sing right cuz
[36:37] they don't know anything about our God
[36:38] and our
[36:41] savior are you
[36:44] listening see the book that went back
[36:48] back there was the book of names yep
[36:52] right but the book in the hand of the
[36:54] one sitting on the throne if you want to
[36:56] to call it that it's the Bible cuz it's
[36:59] Bible is the Book of Life right brother
[37:02] R will call it the
[37:04] Bible cuz it's the book of life right
[37:06] amen but in this book of life there also
[37:08] a lot of bad things you know what it
[37:11] does it tells you all about how dirty
[37:13] you are right Paul said in such were
[37:16] some of you some of us amen that's right
[37:20] but I like what he sung a new song cuz
[37:24] he said but now we're
[37:25] clean washed amen Washed by the blood
[37:29] amen see this Bible then shows you
[37:33] the natural life that we're living
[37:38] amen but it shows also the eternal life
[37:42] that is dwelling on Earth cuz here's
[37:44] Peter James John that's those names that
[37:47] were written in that book of life before
[37:49] the foundation of the world you
[37:52] know but then their lives at here even
[37:55] to Peter D doubting and problems but you
[37:58] know it was before his new birth
[38:00] right you don't find any doubting in
[38:02] Peter after his new birth made
[38:05] manifest you find him ready to give his
[38:08] life for the
[38:11] gospel but do you see what I'm talking
[38:13] about you see what I've been trying to
[38:14] say I know it's confusing when I come
[38:17] out and say hey everybody's been talking
[38:19] about opening the book book this book
[38:21] that they don't even know how the book
[38:23] got
[38:25] sealed
[38:27] okay how did the book in Revelations 5
[38:29] get sealed whatever kind of book you
[38:32] want to make it
[38:33] right whatever you want to call it or
[38:35] what it is how did it get sealed cuz it
[38:39] is
[38:42] sealed yeah but we know the seals
[38:44] brother there we know all about
[38:47] seals
[38:51] yeah listen church I know I've made Mass
[38:54] confusion When people's minds are saying
[38:55] one thing the sealed of the literal
[38:58] happening of those seals is to Israel
[39:02] amen the revelation of those seals is to
[39:05] the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't want
[39:08] to be around here when the six seal
[39:10] breaks to
[39:11] you cuz you'd be in the tribulation
[39:14] right right
[39:16] amen well that's what they thought
[39:18] brother around and was
[39:21] saying
[39:23] right when you get over to the Feast of
[39:25] the trumpets like the brother said said
[39:27] he made so many slips of the tongue that
[39:29] it can't be understood brother R gets
[39:31] over there and he says see here he said
[39:32] there's a seven a in a seventh
[39:37] angel Mal for he says to come between
[39:40] the sixth and seventh
[39:43] seal well now if it comes between the
[39:45] sixth and seventh seal that'll put him
[39:47] in the
[39:48] tribulation if that's all you know
[39:53] right he said well brother Dale the seal
[39:55] is broke to the bride amen
[39:59] amen but are we there where they are to
[40:02] make be made
[40:04] manifest you better not be there when
[40:06] that first one is cuz that was the only
[40:08] question they
[40:09] asking does second Thessalonians the man
[40:13] of sin sitting in the temple of God
[40:14] showing himself to be as God is that the
[40:16] first heal he said
[40:18] yes so you better not be there for that
[40:20] you better be there where that God takes
[40:22] the seal off and reveals to
[40:25] you but the things is taking place I
[40:28] don't want to be where they're at I want
[40:29] to be where the revealing is at this is
[40:31] the revealing of the book
[40:34] amen while the book is being written
[40:36] about you and I it's being revealed
[40:39] right we are the revealed book yeah
[40:42] that's right we are the word of God
[40:44] that's being made
[40:48] manifest we are that book amen that's in
[40:52] the hand of the one sitting on the
[40:54] throne Lord
[40:59] and then he can take what's
[41:03] there and he's got a book to go to
[41:05] Israel y right right exactly you
[41:08] remember we brought it out Sunday trying
[41:10] to to show where the prophet of God even
[41:12] was confused on that Fifth Fifth chapter
[41:17] because when he answered that question
[41:20] right is that the Saints he says
[41:24] no that is not the
[41:29] Saints he said they're not redeemed he
[41:33] said that's the elders and the the
[41:36] beasts and
[41:38] things but he's done forgot that he's in
[41:41] heaven
[41:42] right he's thinking that's some
[41:44] Redemption for
[41:48] Earth chapter 4 and five is in heaven
[41:51] amen
[41:54] yep the bride already in glory
[41:58] right she's the book that's what I'm
[42:01] tried to explain to you that's right and
[42:04] then I ask you a simple question I know
[42:07] that is fensive to people could he take
[42:09] your Revelation and convert to Jews
[42:11] right
[42:12] M right well I don't really know where
[42:15] there's one God or three you know kind
[42:17] of look like it's three sometimes
[42:18] sometimes maybe there's four or five I
[42:20] don't really know is it important for me
[42:24] to know yes that's what everybody says
[42:27] right once you start talking to anybody
[42:29] that's the first thing you think we need
[42:31] to know
[42:32] this all we need to know is Jesus Christ
[42:37] died for our
[42:39] sins that's
[42:42] it well go right over there and join
[42:45] that church cuz that's what he preaches
[42:46] every
[42:48] Sunday I'm not sarcastic I'm telling the
[42:51] God's honest truth you don't go to a
[42:54] Baptist Church and hear them preach that
[42:56] salvation comes by believing in some
[42:59] hudo they preach it comes by believing
[43:01] in Jesus
[43:02] Christ
[43:05] right but then the scripture says no man
[43:08] can call him the Christ unless it's by
[43:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[43:13] right could he take your
[43:18] Revelation and show Israel one God
[43:20] that's right now you see why did I spent
[43:23] 40 something years preaching one God
[43:28] y could he take your revelation of one
[43:30] God and converted you that's
[43:37] right brother R was listening to him the
[43:39] other day he said them Jews can show you
[43:42] where that Trinity come from y he said
[43:45] they can tell you all of these things
[43:48] because they studied
[43:51] it so that's why you can't cut God in
[43:54] three pieces and give him to a Jew
[43:58] now how could you take the doctrines in
[44:00] this message and go to
[44:02] Israel that's right two Lords Two Souls
[44:05] River Jordans you know God not god Till
[44:08] The River Jordan all these
[44:11] things you see why it's not going to
[44:13] work they've tried to do it
[44:18] right I'm not TR to explain there have
[44:21] churches in Israel right today that are
[44:24] following this message sure
[44:27] but is that going to convert the
[44:33] Jews well how come it won't
[44:44] convert back come come on right all you
[44:47] got to do is get the word brother just
[44:49] give him the
[44:53] books now You' seen the ladies is coming
[44:56] on all these things after the guy you
[44:58] know jumped up that brother R was out
[45:00] there at the wrong time hunting and all
[45:01] this that and other now this big things
[45:03] on the Blasted on the internet around
[45:05] the world showing the fallaces of
[45:07] brother rand's
[45:10] message you don't have them as copy in
[45:13] my
[45:14] office see everybody's getting on the
[45:17] bandwagon
[45:20] now church we don't see the man of sin
[45:22] sitting in the temple of God showing
[45:24] himself to be as God and in a literal
[45:26] extent Israel sees that of the breaking
[45:30] of the Covenant but we see him sitting
[45:33] now amen now in the people of this
[45:35] message because the greatest and the
[45:37] closest to the truth is where the
[45:39] Antichrist can be the greatest that's
[45:41] right yes sir so you think that I'm
[45:44] hateful for talking about those things
[45:45] no I'm trying to warn you just don't get
[45:47] caught with
[45:52] them I just simply ask you the question
[45:55] cuz your Revelation converted you
[45:59] amen and I don't mean this
[46:03] wrong but how many of
[46:07] your mannerisms and conversation and
[46:10] life and things has converted people to
[46:12] this message right
[46:16] amen
[46:20] right
[46:22] sorry I shouldn't be that a it's true
[46:26] but one not it's the truth
[46:29] amen the prophet said your life is so
[46:32] loud I can't hear your
[46:34] words right oh that's for them other
[46:38] people
[46:40] no a live life is a greater book than
[46:43] any book any talk you can do with your
[46:45] lips amen right all
[46:49] right let me get off there and get
[46:52] back do you see what I'm talking about
[46:55] right
[46:57] let's just read go ahead brother Joe
[46:58] pull up Revelations 5 we got him in the
[47:00] office all bicep t i cuz I told him
[47:02] going have nothing but a few
[47:06] scriptures let these other brothers
[47:09] rest but I want you to notice how many
[47:11] times he talks of a sealed book right
[47:14] well now what kind of a book is it what
[47:17] what what's wrong here we've done gone
[47:21] up in the
[47:22] Rapture what kind of a book is it
[47:29] yep and I saw in the right hand of him
[47:31] that sat on the throne a book written
[47:33] within and on the backside seal with
[47:35] Seven Seals that's all the people ever
[47:37] deal with is it on the inside or is it
[47:39] on the outside we can't figure that
[47:44] out we can't figure that out whether
[47:47] it's inside or
[47:52] outside we got quotes from R around that
[47:55] sealed on the the inside and sealed on
[47:57] the outside
[48:00] yeah but you better carry that all the
[48:02] way through until you find him saying
[48:04] you can't add one word to the book right
[48:08] no right I tried to explain that years
[48:12] ago but how many of you remember
[48:18] it there's not Seven Seals on the
[48:20] outside of the book there's not seven
[48:23] Thunders on the outside of the book
[48:26] Daniel heard the Thunders right they're
[48:28] in the book John heard the Thunders
[48:30] they're in the book
[48:33] yeah but he had a quote from Brother
[48:36] brandom the Thunders is the only thing
[48:39] that's left and they're on the back side
[48:41] of the book now what's he talking about
[48:43] he's done explained to you it's not a
[48:45] book like this right he's done explained
[48:48] it's not this that it Scrolls and things
[48:52] right why can't you remember that get
[48:54] away from a book
[48:57] but once you get down to a point of
[49:02] thinking that
[49:06] book is a book of
[49:09] names and it's sealed up until those
[49:11] names are
[49:16] revealed until it's revealed
[49:20] amen it's not
[49:23] written inside and on the backside
[49:27] writing why don't you just get simple
[49:30] weird
[49:33] thinking everybody wait that this a
[49:36] simple statement I've made for 40
[49:41] years then the book that is written is
[49:45] sealed by The Book of
[49:52] Revelations it's not outside the book
[49:55] right be outside the book you you get
[49:57] your CL sometimes
[50:00] right well it was on the outside till
[50:02] the prophet broke it well did he go
[50:05] outside the book and get his Revelation
[50:09] no come on did he go outside the book
[50:13] and get his Revelation no he didn't do
[50:14] that his Prophet
[50:16] am it had to be what was in the book he
[50:19] said but where light had not shined on
[50:22] what in the Bible had light not shined
[50:25] on right right Peter didn't preach one
[50:27] God water baptism no Eternal Hells and
[50:30] thing right you said no you can't well
[50:32] it's in there in his writings y
[50:36] right but the Book of Revelations has
[50:38] the Bible
[50:41] sealed that's what it seal with on the
[50:44] back it's the last book in the Bible
[50:47] right right there's not another book
[50:48] after The Book of Revelations so that's
[50:51] the backside of the book
[50:53] right y The Book of Revelations it seals
[50:56] the entire book Y and until those seals
[50:59] are
[51:00] broke that's
[51:07] right I'm going to throw you a curve to
[51:09] where you follow one of these days and I
[51:10] get to it when you get to Revelation 61
[51:13] there's only one seal broke in
[51:17] 61 right so then there's six more so the
[51:21] book ain't opened in Revelation 6:1 it's
[51:24] only part the open
[51:28] right you got to have all of those Seven
[51:31] Seals to be open for the book to be
[51:34] opened
[51:38] right he church so what does he say and
[51:41] I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a
[51:43] loud voice who's worthy to open the book
[51:46] y though the book's
[51:48] closed Y and to loose the seals thereof
[51:51] seal with the
[51:53] seals no man in heaven no man under the
[51:55] Earth was able to open the
[51:57] book why it's a seal book needed to look
[52:01] there on you couldn't even look at it
[52:04] right what do you mean I can't look at
[52:06] it I I I pick it up and
[52:10] yeah what your Prophet said said you
[52:12] stop at drunk driving down the highway
[52:15] and he saw drunk and you ask him is
[52:17] Jesus Christ God and you say yes he said
[52:21] but he only knows what somebody else
[52:23] said right y
[52:26] it's not a revelation to him
[52:31] no no man in heaven or on Earth neither
[52:33] under Earth was able to open the book
[52:36] neither to look her own and I we much
[52:38] because no man was found worthy to open
[52:41] open open open to a
[52:45] seal and read the book neither to look
[52:48] there
[52:50] on and one of the elders says we not
[52:53] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[52:54] has Prov Veil to open the
[52:59] book and loose the Seven
[53:02] Seals brother Rand couldn't do that cuz
[53:06] no man in heaven no man on Earth brother
[53:08] Rand said Moses was there Elijah was
[53:11] there he said all of them that had died
[53:14] in Christ was there there's no man worth
[53:17] it so don't holler say brother R was
[53:19] worthy he's the one that's just told us
[53:21] he's not worthy that's
[53:24] right but get what I'm talking
[53:28] about he's
[53:31] prevailed he's overcome so he can open
[53:35] the book he can lose the seals right the
[53:39] land so in Revelation 61 it says and the
[53:42] lamb opened the first
[53:48] seal second one it says and the lamb
[53:51] opened third fourth now it don't get
[53:54] down on over there about 5 and 6 and say
[53:57] the lamb opened the fifth seal but you
[54:00] got enough sense to know what's going
[54:02] on so don't be a you know what reason I
[54:06] get that I I know what goes in people's
[54:08] mind well ain't no Lamb on the for and
[54:11] F or something like that boy look at the
[54:16] Revelation on water
[54:19] yeah and behold low in the midst of the
[54:21] throne the Elder still is a lamb he had
[54:24] seven horns and seven eyes which is
[54:25] seven spirits of God it's like we said
[54:27] now what kind of lamb is
[54:31] it
[54:32] y That's not talking about Calvary he
[54:36] never had seven horns and seven eyes at
[54:38] Calvary no that's
[54:41] right right this is the end time
[54:45] right when the book is sealed
[54:50] up only after the book is sealed up does
[54:52] a lamb appear with seven horns and seven
[54:55] and I and all right we put message after
[54:57] message to do prove what where did the
[54:59] lamb come from right did we not read
[55:03] that it came from the church
[55:05] ages cuz those horns and eyes are The
[55:07] Messengers and the ages go back in
[55:10] chapter one and read it'll tell you that
[55:15] right where did this lamb come
[55:19] from what's he doing in the end
[55:22] time he's fixing to go to Israel yep
[55:26] right he's going to take those seals off
[55:29] that book and go to Israel amen cu the
[55:31] next Redemption is Israel and chapter 5
[55:33] we're in heaven
[55:35] man right simple everybody says I'm so
[55:39] deep but what is it
[55:43] simple
[55:44] look and he came and took the book out
[55:47] of the right hand of him to set upon the
[55:50] throne he took the book now brother
[55:52] around I gave them to you it's on souls
[55:53] and prison and uh who do you say this is
[55:55] is two different quote that brother
[55:57] around said he took the book climbed up
[55:59] on the throne and said I am
[56:01] yeah all right so that's what he's
[56:02] referring to he took the book out of the
[56:04] right hand of him that set upon the
[56:06] throne right see we look at like two
[56:08] people when they got no he took the book
[56:11] he come to the position the book in him
[56:12] was one he walks upon on the throne and
[56:15] sits down who the
[56:17] lamb the lamb that has seven horns and
[56:20] seven eyes right CLS up on the throne
[56:22] and sits down
[56:26] the prophet said it like this he said he
[56:27] become the one on the throne right as
[56:30] your Revelation put him back on the
[56:32] throne right or do you still have
[56:34] wonders about Trinity or what this is or
[56:36] what that well brother so so explain
[56:38] it's so
[56:39] beautiful yeah like that brother that
[56:41] had that big thing and had the screens
[56:43] of it and everything you know and
[56:44] everybody just went
[56:48] haywire he had it all draw out where
[56:50] this great Pillar of Fire went up here
[56:52] and went over here and come down down
[56:55] over here and he just raced this
[56:58] out that's where he first messed up
[57:02] y because brother ROM never
[57:06] said all God like all that we think was
[57:10] poured into
[57:11] Christ because there was a part of
[57:13] Christ that was not made manifest until
[57:15] the Book of
[57:18] Revelation
[57:20] right look and when he had taken the
[57:22] book The Four beasts Anders fell down
[57:24] for the lamp having every one of them
[57:26] hearts and golden vs full of odors which
[57:28] are the prayers of the
[57:32] Saints y now and they
[57:39] who not the
[57:41] lamb not the
[57:45] elders not the the four Beast you see
[57:49] well that was part of it yeah it's part
[57:51] of it but now you're getting into the
[57:53] story mhm the Saints are singing a new
[57:57] song what are they singing see that's
[57:59] where brother Brandon when he answered
[58:00] from here up in his talk but then when
[58:03] he dropped down and read that nin verse
[58:05] he said that is the Bride of Jesus
[58:07] Christ I was fixing I answered that
[58:11] wrong and they sang a new
[58:16] song now
[58:19] watch what is that new
[58:22] song would not that new song
[58:25] be what the prophet of God was
[58:28] saying when he said when the seals
[58:32] broke it become a brand new
[58:36] book is that what he said not a
[58:38] different book
[58:41] right not something
[58:44] different from the song you were singing
[58:46] about the
[58:50] blood you finally see as a prophet would
[58:53] say you're not saved by by the blood see
[58:55] Luther w i mean Wesley and all them
[58:57] thought you were saved by the blood
[58:59] little said you're not saved by the
[59:01] blood he said you're saved by the life
[59:03] that was in the blood he said you're
[59:05] kept saved by the blood CU it's on the
[59:09] throne see then you're moving up right
[59:12] amen it's opening up singing a new song
[59:16] and watch the worthy to take the book
[59:21] amen and to open the seals now it didn't
[59:24] say he did right there
[59:26] no you find in chapter 5 one worthy to
[59:31] take the book and what the book is
[59:35] chapter
[59:36] six is when the lamb opens the first
[59:40] SE get it in correct
[59:43] order read it in correct order look why
[59:45] they sing a new song dark worthy to take
[59:48] the book and open the seal there for
[59:50] thou was slain who was slain the lamb
[59:53] Christ right and has redeemed us amen
[59:57] that's it to God by thy blood out of
[1:00:00] every Kindred tongue and people and
[1:00:03] Nation like way said the other day see
[1:00:05] then that can't be Israel
[1:00:07] n because they're not redeemed out of
[1:00:09] every Kindred Nation they're redeemed
[1:00:11] out of Israel they may be living in
[1:00:14] every nation and Kingdom but they're not
[1:00:16] in that that are not that's not them
[1:00:18] they're Jews amen that's
[1:00:20] right listen has redeemed us to God out
[1:00:23] of every k
[1:00:25] and hath made us unto our God Kings and
[1:00:28] Priests and shall reign on the earth
[1:00:31] amen that's it remember what it says
[1:00:34] there so keep looking at
[1:00:37] that chapter 4
[1:00:41] 14 and I looked and L lamb stood on the
[1:00:43] mount s and with him
[1:00:46] 144,000 having his father's name written
[1:00:49] in their forehead look what's already
[1:00:51] happened to
[1:00:53] them and I heard Heard a Voice from
[1:00:55] Heaven as the voice of many Waters and
[1:00:57] the voice of a great Thunder and heard
[1:00:59] the voice of Hearts harping harping with
[1:01:02] their hearts and they sang as it were a
[1:01:04] new song Before the Throne yeah watch
[1:01:08] their song now remember their song you
[1:01:10] made us priests and Kings right you
[1:01:13] redeemed us watch what their song is and
[1:01:15] they sang as it were right and you song
[1:01:19] see because they they couldn't sang it
[1:01:22] before before son Before the Throne and
[1:01:25] before the four Beast and the elders and
[1:01:28] no man could learn that song right
[1:01:31] listen right but the
[1:01:34] 144,000 which were
[1:01:37] redeemed from the Earth all it says that
[1:01:40] they're
[1:01:42] redeemed nobody can't sing that
[1:01:45] song but the
[1:01:47] 144,000 no man can't sing this song that
[1:01:51] we're looking at in Revelations 5
[1:01:53] right where he's made us priest and King
[1:01:56] nobody can sing that the Jews can't sing
[1:01:58] that right amen cuz they don't come
[1:02:00] after sunship
[1:02:03] right you don't understand what that
[1:02:05] prophet he answered that
[1:02:07] question there in the questions and
[1:02:10] answers on the seal he said that is not
[1:02:12] the Saints right now what if God had not
[1:02:15] stopped him that's right there's only
[1:02:17] two redemptions in the Bible That's
[1:02:19] Right
[1:02:21] 144,000 and a
[1:02:23] bride that you're dealing with yep so he
[1:02:26] would have been saying that was Israel
[1:02:30] y well that's okay we're over in fourth
[1:02:35] chapter see that's how silly people are
[1:02:38] right if he made that
[1:02:41] Israel we can't say that we're priests
[1:02:44] and Kings Israel would be the priests
[1:02:47] and the Kings cuz they would be singing
[1:02:49] that song we wouldn't even have a song
[1:02:51] to sing right right that's right
[1:02:56] we wouldn't have anything to shout about
[1:02:58] when you get on down in the further in
[1:03:00] the fifth
[1:03:04] chapter we wouldn't have
[1:03:07] anything we would all be going to Israel
[1:03:10] yep and how many years have I tried my
[1:03:13] best to preach to you one
[1:03:16] thing in the Old Testament there was no
[1:03:19] eternal life as a possession except Adam
[1:03:23] that's right

[1:03:28] Testament that talks about having

[1:03:38] life right that's why they a singing you

[1:03:48] that can cover a lot of people yes sir Y
[1:03:52] and they can sing that song of Israel
[1:03:54] but they can't sing what the 144,000 can
[1:03:57] sing right you know the 144,000 can't be
[1:04:01] nothing but Unix to the bride
