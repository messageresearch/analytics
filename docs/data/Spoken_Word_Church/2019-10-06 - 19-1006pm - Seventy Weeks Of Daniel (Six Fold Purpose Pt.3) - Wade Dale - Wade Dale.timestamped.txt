[20:29] six fold purpose this will be part three
[20:31] let's go ahead and do this if you'll
[20:32] turn to the turn to the scripture we're
[20:34] going to I kind of I told you I'd give
[20:39] you the the paper but I forgot that the
[20:45] ones on the internet can't see that
[20:46] paper so we're going to kind of fix this
[20:51] that for the ones on on the internet so
[20:56] they can see also Lord bless you hope
[21:00] you enjoyed it it's um it's something
[21:02] that I really enjoy I enjoy talking
[21:04] about the Lord I enjoy talking about
[21:06] what what God's done for us and what
[21:08] he's still gonna do for us and
[21:10] is gonna do for him after we leave so
[21:13] let's get into this and we will we will
[21:17] we got the organ there now so we're
[21:21] gonna have to make them no one not
[21:24] nothing Sarah's off over here get all
[21:26] over me

[21:34] all right turn it this way just a little
[21:36] bit how about that that better well
[21:39] Sarah sorry Oh how's that okay I know
[21:47] you're gonna have a little glare on it
[21:48] but we working on that Daniel 9 verse 21
[21:52] let's go to the Lord in prayer know we
[21:53] all have again unspoken requests on our
[21:56] heart we always have something on our
[21:57] heart that we that we carry with us so
[22:01] just keep those prayers in front of the
[22:03] Lord the Heavenly Father would thank you
[22:05] today for an opportunity that we can
[22:07] stand before the purchase of your blood
[22:11] you went to Calvary for one purpose and
[22:14] that was to get a bride that we see now
[22:17] in the end time and also Lord you you're
[22:20] gonna get that huh little Benjamin group
[22:22] that 144,000 is gonna come out of there
[22:24] and be filled with the Holy Ghost but
[22:27] Lord has got to be that we get out of
[22:29] here we can't do it alone we have to
[22:32] have the Word of God we have to have a
[22:34] fivefold ministry that's solid that will
[22:36] give us the word Lord and it'll teach us
[22:39] Lord you said you'd send the Holy Ghost
[22:42] and it would teach us and lead us and
[22:44] guide us into all truth so we pray Lord
[22:46] that truth will be spoken today and that
[22:49] you'll be the one that does the speaking
[22:50] father you'll be the one that does the
[22:53] revealing because we can't do that on
[22:54] our own father we pray that you'd just
[22:57] be with the ones here Lord bless them in
[22:59] body if they're not born again father we
[23:02] pray that you would just as we always
[23:05] think of the ones Lord that some come in
[23:08] and say I couldn't go to sleep or or I
[23:11] was so burdened with lord I that burden
[23:13] on my heart for several people that I
[23:15] could that I named him in my head all
[23:18] the time Lord and I know there's one
[23:19] sitting here Lord that has children
[23:21] husbands wives different things
[23:24] or two out in the world not serving you
[23:26] Father will we pray Lord that they'll
[23:29] come under conviction father and that
[23:30] you'll go to them and you will stir
[23:33] their water Lord so much to where they
[23:34] want to know more about you father and
[23:36] we here today want to know more about
[23:38] you though we may some have been walked
[23:40] many many many many years in this
[23:43] Christian way but there's Lord there's
[23:45] more of you to be had so there's more of
[23:48] you
[23:48] to be given probably give us this day
[23:51] our daily bread

[23:53] the family down there is their doing the
[23:55] funeral at the moment Father we pray
[23:57] that you just be with them touch each
[23:59] one father bless us take care of us in
[24:01] Jesus name Amen
[24:02] Daniel 9 21 yay while I was speaking in
[24:06] prayer even the man Gabriel whom I'd
[24:08] seen in the vision at the beginning
[24:09] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[24:12] about the time of the evening oblation
[24:14] and he informed me and talk with me and
[24:16] said old Daniel I am now come forth to
[24:18] give thee skill and understanding at the
[24:21] beginning of my supplication the
[24:22] commandment came forth and I in come to
[24:25] show thee for thou art greatly beloved
[24:27] thank God for that he's talking to you
[24:30] today thou art greatly beloved therefore
[24:33] understand the matter and consider the
[24:36] vision seventy weeks are determined upon
[24:38] thy people and upon the holy city to do
[24:41] six things we talked about three this
[24:42] morning we're going to get to rest this
[24:43] afternoon to finish the transgression to
[24:46] make an end of sins to make
[24:49] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[24:51] everlasting righteousness to seal up the
[24:53] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[24:55] most holy
[24:56] know therefore and understand that from
[24:59] the going forth of the commandment to
[25:01] restore and rebuild Jerusalem unto
[25:03] Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks
[25:06] and threescore and two weeks the street
[25:09] shall be built again in the wall even in
[25:11] troublous times and after threescore in
[25:15] two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but
[25:17] not for himself he was called for me and
[25:19] you and the people of the prince that
[25:21] shall come shall destroy the city which
[25:23] was Titus in the sanctuary and the end
[25:25] thereof shall be with a flood and to the
[25:27] end of the war desolations are
[25:29] determined and he shall confirm the
[25:30] covenant with many for one week and in
[25:33] the midst of the week he shall cause the
[25:35] sacrifice and oblation deceased and for
[25:37] the overspreading of abominations he
[25:39] shall make it desolate even unto the
[25:41] consummation and that determined shall
[25:42] be poured out upon the desolate you may
[25:46] be seated in the Lord that is blessing
[25:47] to the reason of the work and to all
[25:56] right so we we already know that do I
[25:58] have to keep telling you over and over
[25:59] one week equals seven years you should
[26:02] know that it's in the BIOS in your Bible
[26:04] business if you don't know it read it
[26:05] it's in the book of Genesis a man thing
[26:08] your Bibles been in your Bible the whole
[26:09] time man been there the whole time so
[26:17] I'm just gonna kind of do it like that
[26:27] Chloe what are you doing back there
[26:30] that's got to be her that's all right
[26:34] it's okay she's saying praise the Lord
[26:36] y'all just didn't hear
[26:45] all right so what we're talking about
[26:47] now is this last week or last seven
[26:55] years yeah I was thinking I thought well
[26:59] we'll just do it on a chart Thomas
[27:01] Thomas is back there in the back I want
[27:03] y'all to know he has rope he has took
[27:05] notes and wrote the whole thing full you
[27:08] can't hardly see him when I wrote he
[27:09] wrote notes let me see some of y'all's
[27:14] or some of y'all that don't even have
[27:17] them you got to study really you do I
[27:23] mean if you're not you gonna be confused
[27:27] alright so this is the six fold purpose
[27:29] this is Daniel 9:24 to me this explains
[27:34] everything in a nutshell we got to go
[27:37] through dates and times and we know
[27:38] what's going on we know this was the
[27:40] church ages this will be the Gentile
[27:42] rapture because as soon as we go up he
[27:44] comes right down through two witnesses
[27:47] and starts the 1260 days according to
[27:50] revelations 11 the 1260 days of
[27:53] preaching to the Jews is that right say
[27:56] ma'am
[27:57] all right through through what to
[28:00] prophets do to two prophets 1260 days
[28:13] I'm just gonna write Armageddon right
[28:15] there because in the midst of the week
[28:19] according to the scripture what happens
[28:23] the man of sin breaks his covenant he's
[28:28] gonna make a covenant with many for one
[28:30] week all right now remembered that he is
[28:33] the Antichrist we're not here when that
[28:35] signed we'll get into that later on you
[28:38] will not if you see that treaty sign you
[28:41] missed the rapture okay so that happens
[28:45] right here then right so he shall make a
[28:48] covenant with many for one week and in
[28:53] the midst of the week what's in the
[28:55] middle of seven three and a half or 1260
[28:58] days
[28:59] so you got 1260 and 1260 got it so now
[29:06] but what's going to happen is is in this
[29:09] time this period Israel is going to be
[29:13] redeemed and so is the land or the city
[29:17] because remember what have I been
[29:18] telling you it's to the Jews and to the
[29:22] land or Jerusalem or our building of the
[29:25] walls or building of the temple and all
[29:27] that we'll get in just a little while
[29:28] that okay okay so there's three things
[29:31] got to be done one and I'm going to just
[29:33] put finish because you can read it
[29:35] number two make an end of sin finish the
[29:38] transgression make an end of sin we're
[29:40] talking about we're going to go through
[29:41] in just a minute and three we're going
[29:43] to reconcile all right so we're going to
[29:49] finish the transgression make an
[29:50] innocent reconciliation for iniquity now
[29:53] what does that do that that takes the
[29:57] 144,000 and redeems them that all rights
[30:01] amen
[30:02] their redemption comes right here about
[30:08] what about the land what about the other
[30:12] three it takes 6 this is a 6 fold
[30:15] purpose not a 3 fold purpose it's a 6
[30:18] fold purpose so you gotta have three
[30:20] more which will be number four we're
[30:22] gonna talk about in a few minutes okay
[30:23] we're gonna bring in everlasting
[30:25] righteousness if you'll get this I'm
[30:30] just gonna paraphrase here and you may
[30:34] not be and see it from the back but they
[30:35] can zoom in it on the camera and let the
[30:37] people steal it see it on the internet
[30:41] so we're gonna bring in we're gonna talk
[30:46] about bringing the never license rice in
[30:48] this silt division property and a
[30:49] Northland most holy because if you
[30:51] anoint the most holy here's the key if
[30:53] you anoint the most holy brother Brown
[30:54] tells you I'm gonna read you what he
[30:56] said that is us coming back into the
[30:58] Millennial temple anointing the temple
[31:01] well now if you've only like most people
[31:03] in the message this is what they see
[31:04] this is what they make it out to be that
[31:11] there's only 1260
[31:13] days left after the rapture to finish
[31:15] Daniel 70 weeks that's not true
[31:17] according to the Bible
[31:20] so who we're going to believe the Bible
[31:26] because how you going to bring in
[31:28] everlasting rice and there's gonna be a
[31:29] battle right here I'm gonna read it in
[31:31] the Bible there's a Battle of Armageddon
[31:33] that destroys everything right here how
[31:37] you gonna bring in everlasting
[31:38] righteousness and how you gonna put all
[31:39] six of them over here
[31:41] how you gonna nort the most holy in us
[31:42] going into the Millennial temple that's
[31:44] being built by the Jews in that length
[31:48] of time can't happen
[31:50] ain't gonna happen you got to have time
[31:54] for bringing in everlasting rice and
[31:55] cell division and property in North
[31:57] North the most holy here's what the
[31:58] problem people think that we're saying
[32:00] they're saying that we're preaching that
[32:02] there's seven years tribulation I never
[32:04] said that the Bible never said that the
[32:08] Bible says he shall confirm the covenant
[32:10] with many for one week I'm just reading
[32:12] you what the Bible says and in the midst
[32:15] of the week he's gonna cut off after
[32:17] that 1260 days he's the Antichrist is
[32:22] going to come in going to break his
[32:25] covenant and say hey stop it I am your
[32:28] God that you're looking for and then
[32:31] what's going to happen is the Jews are
[32:33] gonna get really mad and they're gonna
[32:34] get mad at these two prophets than
[32:36] 144,000 gotta put them in there cuz
[32:39] they're gonna be saved all they need is
[32:41] these three three completes the birth
[32:45] justification sanctification baptism the
[32:47] Holy Ghost completes the birth but
[32:49] you've got to you've got to bring the
[32:51] land then you've got to bring the
[32:52] buildings in cuz it's to Daniel people
[32:56] Daniels people and the city how you
[33:00] gonna build a Millennial temple anointed
[33:03] let's come back in Revelation 19 I'll
[33:05] read it to you how you gonna do that and
[33:07] then have a battle of Armageddon where
[33:09] everything is destroyed again you'd have
[33:11] to rebuild the temple you'd have to do
[33:14] all these again but why not be careful
[33:17] with what you're talking about
[33:18] see what the Bible says see what the
[33:20] prophet of God says that there is one
[33:23] week left after the rapture now there's
[33:24] only 1206
[33:26] days of preaching laughs there's only
[33:29] 1260 days of what they call Jacob
[33:31] trouble are the Tribulation Period
[33:35] because what remember the Gentiles are
[33:38] going to be hunted like dogs the foolish
[33:39] virgin and all the ones that a couple
[33:41] water in my name and even these 144,000
[33:44] but they're gonna die and then they got
[33:46] to come back 144,000 of the Jews they
[33:49] got to come back somewhere and Bill they
[33:51] listen there's got to be a temple built
[33:52] between right here and somewhere right
[33:55] here according the Bible you can't build
[34:00] it right here and then destroy it so
[34:05] what I'm telling you the Bible is that
[34:07] you go back to the Bible so you say well
[34:09] I got this quote well it better match
[34:11] the Bible and we know it will because
[34:17] I'm gonna tell you one more time
[34:18] whatever you think I'm saying the
[34:21] prophet of God was right now
[34:25] didn't Jesus tell us one time he kind of
[34:28] looked at his disciples and he said
[34:30] these things were here to hide it from
[34:34] the eyes of the wise and prudent Jesus
[34:39] said some really hard things to drive a
[34:41] bunch of people away eat my flesh drink
[34:44] my blood and all those different things
[34:45] he was pretty adamant about it and then
[34:48] there was a lot of people left so you
[34:50] know what that's the way it is in the
[34:52] message have you not heard several years
[34:56] ago when they all started leaving the
[34:58] message Geoff Jenkins and all them and
[35:00] I'll name the name cuz I really don't
[35:01] care that's the first thing they said
[35:04] was his brother branham was so wrong in
[35:06] Daniel seventy weeks that he was so
[35:08] confused at how could he be a prophet
[35:10] didn't he the ones of you that heard it
[35:13] the all those other ones very same thing
[35:16] they said no Daniel seven weeks and the
[35:18] clouds the days they just did not have
[35:21] the Holy Ghost cuz well that without the
[35:23] Holy Ghost you will leave this message
[35:26] if you got the baptism I Holy Ghost
[35:28] right now today you cannot leave this
[35:31] message
[35:34] well the brown said to the evidences
[35:36] that you receive the word for the hour
[35:38] that you're living in and I'm gonna I'm
[35:42] going to interpolate I'm going to
[35:47] interpolate and I say that you can't
[35:51] turn any of it down and have the Holyoke
[35:53] you turn any part of the word down
[35:56] you're a word rejecter amen and brother
[36:01] brown it was real clear about where word
[36:03] rejecters wind Amen now to say you don't
[36:07] understand it that's a big difference
[36:08] and say that don't mean that
[36:10] Amen alright so here we are set up and
[36:13] then we'll start reading her quote one
[36:15] week equals seven years the Bible says
[36:17] in Daniel 9:24 that there would be a six
[36:21] fold purpose this six fold would have to
[36:24] come to pass to get them into their
[36:28] millennial reign now I want you to
[36:31] understand something remember there's
[36:32] lap overs I've always said the Battle of
[36:34] Armageddon is not a one day battle it
[36:38] will not be a one day battle because it
[36:40] is a battle of man it is a battle of a
[36:44] comic mashing buttons there's gonna be
[36:48] atomic explosion all over the world see
[36:52] there thank God we're not gonna be here
[36:53] and it's gonna take a while it may take
[36:56] two or three years for everybody to die
[37:00] cuz it's not gonna kill everybody one
[37:02] time but as all that's happening we're
[37:06] safe somewhere the 144,000 safe
[37:09] somewhere but somewhere they got to come
[37:11] back and build that Millennial temple to
[37:12] spark I'll read it to you to start this
[37:16] millennial reign it may come back in
[37:19] here a little bit this way but what I'm
[37:21] saying is the Bible tells us there's one
[37:23] week left after that man right here
[37:26] makes that covenant there's one week
[37:28] left to finish the 490 years of
[37:33] Redemption bringing Israel back would
[37:36] you believe that or not it's the truth
[37:38] all right so we've already had 483 years
[37:41] of it 69 weeks so there's one week left
[37:44] to make the seven
[37:45] four years to finish and put them
[37:48] because it says here since here it shall
[37:52] make it desolate even until the
[37:56] consummation of brother Graham said the
[37:57] consummation is it's when the Jews go
[38:00] into the Millennium come see that's for
[38:01] them this is their time here this is
[38:04] their time it took away jacob's trouble
[38:07] this took away all these things it took
[38:09] away end of sin reconciliation for
[38:11] iniquity bringing in everlasting
[38:13] righteousness Philip division and anoint
[38:15] the most holy that's what we're going to
[38:16] talk about this afternoon but this is to
[38:18] the Jews and it will be literally a
[38:21] thousand years time continues on unto
[38:25] the white throne judgment because
[38:27] remember it's still the old seventh-day
[38:29] brother Brahim explains that read your
[38:31] future home and the different ones you
[38:34] see that is still the old seventh day
[38:36] it's going to be 1,000 years but they
[38:39] could be lap overs either way I'm not
[38:42] gonna be concerned with it but I'm
[38:43] telling you one thing's for sure when
[38:46] this is over with
[38:47] the Millennium has begun it has begun it
[38:52] has begun when set dang that's the whole
[38:54] purpose that's the whole purpose for the
[39:00] six fold purpose is to get them in the
[39:03] Millennium look we don't need a
[39:04] millennium the bride that we're not even
[39:08] promised the Millennium we're we're
[39:11] eternal right here
[39:13] we're eternal we don't have time times
[39:17] in the dividing of times we have time is
[39:19] no longer when you get born again time
[39:21] is no longer time - this doesn't mean
[39:23] anything to you but it does to the Jews
[39:26] and it's the exact there's exactly 1260
[39:31] days now what's gonna happen you say
[39:33] well at the twelve hundred and sixtieth
[39:35] day if they all get saved are they gonna
[39:37] go in the rapture they could be days
[39:39] months in between all that he just said
[39:42] in the midst of the week the Antichrist
[39:45] is going to come in and say I'm your God
[39:48] well it may take him a month or two to
[39:50] get really mad already take it may take
[39:52] them a month or two to kill all the
[39:53] 144,000 but to fulfill the scripture
[39:56] they all have to be killed somewhere
[39:58] to that okay done all right and
[40:02] everybody got their chart this one
[40:04] everybody got that I want you to hang on
[40:07] to it because look this chart right here
[40:09] is official
[40:11] according to George Smith this is what
[40:13] Rebecca drew on the wall at the
[40:15] tabernacle cuz I read it I was listening
[40:18] to it the other day he said Becky that
[40:20] looks like a girl well that look down
[40:23] there that listen he's got a little
[40:24] dress on but it's that kingdom of gold
[40:27] and all that you know the statue
[40:29] standing up but this is official now
[40:31] look you see the top set the type is
[40:33] probably be back in the 60s cuz it one
[40:35] of them old typewriters it click click
[40:37] click and the little kids are going what
[40:38] is that go look it up go back about 40
[40:43] years and you'll see that kind of
[40:44] typewriter so so this is exactly what
[40:48] was written on the blackboard at the
[40:51] tabernacle when brother Branham preached
[40:52] Daniel 70 weeks so I've set and watched
[40:57] him draw all kind of charge I think I'll
[40:59] just take the one the Prophet drew to me
[41:02] that's official and you know what it's
[41:04] according to the Bible all right
[41:06] according the Bible I don't see why
[41:12] people it's why brother Dale said it's
[41:14] really hard to preach the truth it is
[41:16] it's hard to preach the truth it's not
[41:17] hard to preach area you can just draw
[41:19] whatever you want to it make it all fit
[41:21] the way you want it to fit and now but
[41:25] this to me is this this settles
[41:27] everything to me is the sixth full
[41:28] purpose when I read it I'm like man
[41:30] there's got to be one week left after
[41:33] the rapture to make all this come to
[41:34] pass there's got to be seven years left
[41:37] to bring all this to pass because you
[41:39] can't put this over here and finish it
[41:41] like everybody says but all they want to
[41:43] be you know they want to be the first
[41:44] one they want to be the they wanted to
[41:46] be the Bishop of the message or
[41:48] something whatever they want to be and
[41:49] that's fine with me I don't care all
[41:51] right so let's go to 2nd chronicles and
[41:53] let's do a little background here just
[41:58] like what we're talking about this
[41:59] morning in second chronicles let's just
[42:02] go through this real fast
[42:04] talk about 2nd chronicles and all the
[42:06] vessels of the house of God great and
[42:08] small the treasures of the house of the
[42:10] Lord the treasures of the King and ever
[42:12] fences and all that he brought into
[42:13] babbling and they burnt the house of God
[42:15] and break down the wall of Jerusalem and
[42:17] burn all the palaces and destroyed all
[42:18] the goodly vessels in other words that
[42:20] was a fulfillment of the prophecy of
[42:23] Jeremiah that they would be in captivity
[42:26] for 70 years and that the temple and all
[42:30] the things around Jerusalem would be
[42:32] totally desolate there would be nothing
[42:34] there because when they get the Attic to
[42:37] rebuild they got to rebuild the temple
[42:38] and the walls in Jerusalem's everybody
[42:40] got that okay all right so now let's go
[42:43] to number one seventy weeks are
[42:45] determined for what purpose whose people
[42:47] was it determined to pum Daniel's people
[42:50] go to number one well yeah let's read
[42:54] the city full purpose seventy weeks are
[42:55] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[42:57] holy city to do those six things now
[42:59] let's go to number one kind of fly
[43:00] through this because I believe this
[43:02] morning we took our time and you I
[43:04] believe you got it better then you've
[43:07] had before seventy weeks are determined
[43:08] upon thy people for what purpose for
[43:10] what whose people was it determined upon
[43:12] Daniel's people the Jews and what was it
[43:15] determined for upon not only Daniel but
[43:18] Daniels holy city so to fulfill all the
[43:23] 6-volt purpose you got to bring a city
[43:24] in there somewhere you got to bring a
[43:26] temple in there somewhere a ma'am how
[43:28] you gonna do it over here you're gonna
[43:30] destroy it again it's the Battle of
[43:31] Armageddon that's not gonna happen the
[43:33] destructions got to come and then you
[43:35] bring in this this and this
[43:37] oh my gosh that's a ma'am well well I
[43:40] just read it on the board whether you
[43:42] believe it or not that's your business
[43:44] all right six vote purpose we'll go to
[43:46] number two and the seventy of weeks
[43:48] covers from the going off of the church
[43:50] until the coming back of the church that
[43:52] space is what he covers now what's he
[43:53] talking about
[43:56] because in Revelations for one we go
[44:02] into rapture we are not saying until
[44:07] when
[44:08] revelations 1921 will read it tonight
[44:13] where we ride back into the Millennium
[44:15] so the gent this is really this isn't to
[44:17] the Gentiles but it is part of the
[44:21] scripture and brother Bram did spend
[44:22] three sermons on it so it must be
[44:24] aborted
[44:25] get it right number one to get that you
[44:29] and I have to do the same thing they
[44:30] have to come under the same Redemption
[44:33] you and I did go through justification
[44:35] go through sanctification in the baptism
[44:37] of Holy Ghost through two prophets
[44:40] coming and talking to them but to us
[44:42] it's what the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[44:45] talking to us through a fivefold
[44:46] ministry puts us right here and then
[44:50] we're not heard of again or we don't
[44:51] even come back to revelations 1921 and
[44:54] we come back in the millennium not our
[44:57] time but to the Jews that's their
[45:01] thousand years that's their Golden's you
[45:03] believe that they never celebrate it
[45:06] they okay all right
[45:09] that space is what it covers now not all
[45:11] of them in two weeks of Daniel part of
[45:12] it so what he's saying is we got to get
[45:14] the dates and the times over here don't
[45:17] you got your gap right here this is when
[45:18] we were grafted in with the olive tree
[45:20] we were grafted in right in here
[45:23] they were taken out now they're gonna be
[45:25] grafted back in right here 144,000
[45:29] they're going to be grafted back in the
[45:30] olive tree that never died we were
[45:33] living in listen we live off the life of
[45:35] the Old Testament we live off the life
[45:37] of the Jews and Israel and what they do
[45:39] and and you know we don't have to worry
[45:41] about the pots and the pans and they're
[45:43] doing the sacrifices but it's for
[45:45] example there's what they told us in the
[45:46] Bible that's for our example to them the
[45:48] ends of the world come upon man's probed
[45:52] at it for 2,000 years but listen we have
[45:55] the perfect interpretation by divine
[45:59] vindication the prophets said amen
[46:01] so we have the perfect interpretation
[46:03] what are we doing with it what are we
[46:07] doing with it making it everything else
[46:09] but the divine interpretation but there
[46:13] is a truth amen seventy weeks are
[46:20] determined just keep on going let's go
[46:24] on down look to the next paragraph and
[46:26] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[46:27] people now remember that's all the
[46:29] journey of Israelites have on this earth
[46:31] that right there it just culminates in
[46:34] this one week all right all that other
[46:37] is information and how big
[46:39] they're they're determined seventy weeks
[46:41] she's just determined that's all lauded
[46:43] to the Jews upon thy people and upon thy
[46:45] holy city see he never takes the city
[46:49] out so you have to bring the city in
[46:51] you've got to bring the walls in you
[46:54] gotta bring the the temple in because
[46:56] that's important to the Jews okay
[47:00] therefore these seventy of weeks now
[47:02] don't miss it it were a reveal from that
[47:05] time to the end of the Jews and also to
[47:07] the end of Jerusalem because remember
[47:10] Battle of Armageddon is going to be all
[47:11] destroyed everything is okay until
[47:15] there'll be a new city built somewhere
[47:20] in here
[47:21] it can't be built over here it's got to
[47:24] be built somewhere over here because if
[47:26] you build it here man's just gonna kill
[47:29] destroy it here amen all right once you
[47:33] look at it with some good revelation and
[47:38] we've had some good teaching here and
[47:40] like I said brother Dale's been
[47:41] preaching this since 1974 so so it's
[47:44] it's I hope it doesn't become common to
[47:50] us I don't want this this message should
[47:52] never be coming we should always like
[47:55] see when I was when I was going through
[47:56] this and I read that scripture where
[47:59] they said let his blood be on us and our
[48:00] children
[48:01] I always thought man how shameful that's
[48:03] exactly what they were having they had
[48:05] to say they had to say let his blood be
[48:07] on us that's what kept them covered
[48:10] that's what covers me and you Lord I
[48:12] plead the what I plead the blood I never
[48:18] seen it like that before and I'd
[48:19] appreciate it so many times you never
[48:20] see it when you said let his blood be on
[48:22] us and our children they were saying it
[48:24] as a prophecy we know it's a prophecy of
[48:28] rejection but it was a prophecy of
[48:31] salvation that protected them until they
[48:35] except right here until they accept the
[48:38] blood see they don't now because they
[48:40] didn't think cry they just thought they
[48:42] hung a guy I mean they put him on a
[48:43] cross he was just a common thief may
[48:45] have been a good man may have been a
[48:47] prophet don't know but when they
[48:49] realized that was God Almighty and human
[48:51] flesh that was there
[48:52] side that was their Jehovah that was who
[48:55] they had been looking for all those
[48:57] years are you talking about
[49:00] just like well like I said the women are
[49:01] gonna separate from the men they're
[49:03] gonna wail and moan for days when they
[49:05] find out this is good that they had
[49:07] killed the Messiah
[49:09] revelations 11:1 and there was given me
[49:14] a reed like into a rod and the angel
[49:16] stood said rise measured the temple of
[49:17] God and the altar and them that worship
[49:19] therein but the court which is without
[49:21] the temple leave out and measure it not
[49:23] for it is given unto the Gentiles and
[49:25] the Holy City shall they tread under
[49:27] foot forty and two months and I will
[49:30] give power unto my two witnesses and
[49:32] they shall prophesy one thousand two
[49:35] hundred and threescore days
[49:37] that's 1260 days clothed in sackcloth
[49:40] and then we talked about this morning
[49:43] here's what we got - this morning - with
[49:45] justification sanctification in the
[49:48] baptism the Holy Ghost they have got to
[49:50] go through that to redeem the Daniels
[49:54] people not the city not the city yet not
[49:59] to land yet but you got to get look it's
[50:02] just like you and I Adam fell and then
[50:05] all of the world fell everything fell
[50:08] underneath Adam so now when the second
[50:10] Adam come he redeemed everything back to
[50:13] where Adam was and then brings a bride
[50:17] and then until we come to a body change
[50:20] and we're a over able to overcome this
[50:23] fall the fall when we're able to
[50:27] overcome the fall then here comes the
[50:29] earth back up again
[50:30] here comes everything then the 144,000
[50:33] they can come up when they come in then
[50:35] what's going to happen there's going to
[50:36] be a natural battle but that's not going
[50:38] to end it it's going to be within the
[50:40] earth brings forth again the desert will
[50:42] blossom like a rose in this time of the
[50:46] thousand years of millennium now we're
[50:49] not even talking about the future home
[50:51] it's way over here it's a thousand years
[50:55] it's off the chart but that's our home
[50:57] that's what we're looking for that's the
[50:59] city that we're looking for all this
[51:02] right here is to the Jew but we got to
[51:05] go
[51:05] because we're on a honeymoon for a
[51:07] thousand years with Christ while his
[51:10] rote ruling and reigning the 12 tribes
[51:12] of Israel sitting on the throne walk you
[51:14] know what he's only not only one on from
[51:16] these guys clean there with her with him
[51:19] and she will never leave his side
[51:22] ever again she'll always be there with
[51:25] him and then what's going to happen
[51:26] after this thousand years is there's
[51:28] gonna be a white throne judgment then
[51:32] there's gonna be a battle that it's not
[51:34] man's about all this God's battle
[51:35] because remember Satan still alive Satan
[51:40] is still alive and he's gonna be bound
[51:41] up right in here we're gonna read it in
[51:43] just a minute he's gonna be bound up for
[51:45] a thousand years and all his demons that
[51:48] didn't kill him it's just gonna make
[51:50] sure they don't have anything to do but
[51:52] right here at the very end they're gonna
[51:54] pop back up and God's gonna have some
[51:58] holy fire for Battle of Gog and Magog is
[52:01] going to be a holy fire it's not gonna
[52:03] be man's fire because in that battle God
[52:05] is gonna physically kill those demons
[52:08] nothing will be left except the people
[52:11] that were given eternal life to the
[52:13] fifth seal Jew the cup of water of my
[52:16] name the foolish virgin all that and
[52:20] then we enter into the future home which
[52:22] is way down the road over here so you
[52:24] think well we're coming to the end now
[52:26] we're coming to the beginning we're
[52:29] coming as your as a Chris as a
[52:31] non-christian you are coming to an end
[52:33] but as a Christian you're just look we
[52:36] take a rapture in the body change we got
[52:39] a thousand and seven years at least we
[52:42] gotta wait till we get into our new city
[52:44] but you know what it'll be like Rachel
[52:47] and Jacob remember he he fulfilled her
[52:51] week he worked seven years to get a wife
[52:54] and he said it was but just a moment
[52:57] because of his love for Rachel you know
[52:59] what God's been waiting over two
[53:01] thousand years plus seven years to get
[53:06] us to this place to where we can what be
[53:08] husband and wife sitting right side by
[53:10] side amen all right let's let's go
[53:13] number one finish the transgression I'm
[53:16] gonna background just a little bit and
[53:17] then we'll get into them good
[53:19] to the subject finish the transgression
[53:21] what is the transgression is a rebellion
[53:24] it's to recognize its as recognized by
[53:26] Center and sinners and as God forgives
[53:30] so that's what a transgression is the
[53:32] transgression is you do something to get
[53:34] somebody so they did something against
[53:36] God they rebelled right there's his
[53:38] rebellion they rebelled against God but
[53:42] God said I'm gonna finish that
[53:44] transgression finish the transgression
[53:47] so it's going to be done away with now
[53:50] look let's read number at the quote
[53:51] number three now we go back into Daniel
[53:54] we'll find out that in Daniel we'll find
[53:55] out here the 24th verse to finish the
[53:58] transgression to finish what to finish
[54:00] Israel's transgression what is they
[54:02] transgress it is to go against something
[54:05] because remember they were against God
[54:07] all the way I mean all the way from when
[54:11] Mo's well actually when they told Moses
[54:15] to go up on the mountain and get what
[54:17] God said and bring it to them don't let
[54:20] God speak to us Moses you go up there
[54:22] and get what God said bring it to us and
[54:24] we'll do the Bible says we'll do
[54:26] everything you say they lied they lied
[54:29] from that point forward they made Liars
[54:31] they've not done what God said that's
[54:33] why God had to put him away he tried to
[54:36] keep him to be married to him but she
[54:38] just kept going out playing the we
[54:40] read that back in the history and he had
[54:43] finally just I'm done with you I'm gonna
[54:45] divorce you of course he couldn't be
[54:47] married to them in us at the same time
[54:49] okay I can't have to leave my wife it's
[54:54] going against something a transgress
[54:55] against me it's to do a wrong to me
[54:57] transgressed against you is doing wrong
[55:00] to you so Israel did it wrong to God and
[55:03] in this 70th week what's going to happen
[55:07] God is going to finish the transgression
[55:09] of Israel finish the transgression we'll
[55:11] be turning away the ungodliness from
[55:13] Jacob and then all Israel will be born
[55:16] again all of them will receive the Holy
[55:19] Ghost so now let's finish the
[55:20] transgression that's number one all
[55:23] right so then we talked about in Romans
[55:25] 11 if you we don't I didn't bring it up
[55:28] but remember the engrafting everybody
[55:29] understand that when we say in grafting
[55:31] you and I
[55:32] or grafted mmm there was an olive tree
[55:37] when I just said that he had to divorce
[55:39] him or put her away he cut down some of
[55:41] the branches and he grafted in the
[55:45] Gentiles the wild olive off of another
[55:47] tree over here grafted into this tree
[55:50] and then we grew for 2,000 years
[55:53] well now remember I read you in the
[55:55] Bible he couldn't do away with this tree
[55:57] because it still has life he still but
[56:00] he said what is now the mystery is is
[56:03] that God can graft back in the same limb
[56:07] that he cut off two thousand years ago
[56:10] he can graft it back in because right
[56:13] here is doing grafting he grasped him
[56:15] right back into the tree because these
[56:18] people are Jews there's not a Gentile in
[56:20] this bunch they're all Jews even the two
[56:23] prophets are Jews so there we were
[56:28] looking this morning how that
[56:29] justification finished the transgression
[56:31] he justified that group of people and
[56:34] put them on a journey with those two
[56:38] prophets of 1260 days all right number
[56:40] two make an end of sins
[56:43] number two make an end of sins now let's
[56:45] read Daniel to finish transgression make
[56:47] an end of sins that's his second person
[56:50] of purpose of coming first is to finish
[56:52] Israel's transgression and to make an
[56:54] end of sin where did Israel sin where
[56:57] did they do their vital sin
[56:58] where did they separate themselves from
[57:00] God now we read it this morning Matthew
[57:03] 27 go to Matthew 27 verse 20 through 25
[57:07] let's read verse 24 when Pilate saw that
[57:10] he could prevail nothing but that rather
[57:12] a tumult was made he took water and
[57:14] washed his hands before the multitude he
[57:16] just didn't know he couldn't wash that
[57:17] blood off his hands
[57:19] and they couldn't either saying I am
[57:23] innocent of the blood of this just
[57:24] person see to it then answered all the
[57:27] people and said his blood be on us and
[57:31] our children and as I said before that's
[57:33] the best thing they could have said
[57:35] because they were going to they were
[57:37] gone any way that we're gonna crucify
[57:38] him so let that Holy Blood stand because
[57:42] remember the blood speaks but remember
[57:46] that it was nothing
[57:46] chemistry of the blood it's the life
[57:48] that was in the blood all right all
[57:51] right so now in Sakurai thirteen verse
[57:55] one in that day that should be a
[57:56] fountain open to the house of David to
[57:58] the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
[58:01] uncleanness he's beginning to clean up
[58:04] Israel's sin he's finishing the
[58:06] transgression making an end of sins
[58:09] listen that's what he's doing for you or
[58:11] not when we come to a body change we
[58:14] have had an end of sin we have no more
[58:17] sin when we come to a body change even
[58:20] our brain is going to be changed we're
[58:23] not gonna be thinking like what we used
[58:24] to think the former things are passed
[58:26] away behold all things have become new
[58:28] amen
[58:29] you're not gonna have a dirty thought in
[58:31] the body in a change body that's your
[58:34] problem now you're having a minute I
[58:38] won't say dirty thoughts in a dirty body
[58:40] which I mean we're not you understand
[58:42] what I mean you can't help the thoughts
[58:44] come in but boy when we come to that
[58:46] place you say it can't happen well you
[58:50] know what may not to you but it's gonna
[58:54] happen to somebody somebody's gonna come
[58:57] to a place to wear this thing we've got
[58:59] to deny our natural birth we've got to
[59:03] lean so hard on our spiritual birth
[59:06] until that will take over and change our
[59:09] body because remember body change is not
[59:11] coming from stuff out here it's not body
[59:13] change is not coming from Israel getting
[59:16] back in her homeland they've been back
[59:17] there for a long time it's gonna come
[59:20] from what you got inside of you it's
[59:22] gonna come from the word that you hear
[59:24] that comes from here to here Zechariah
[59:29] 13 sixth is that one shall say unto Him
[59:32] where are these wounds in the hand then
[59:35] he shall answer those which I want what
[59:38] a gracious God those which I was wounded
[59:41] in the house of my friends not my
[59:45] enemies my friends awake o sword against
[59:49] my shepherd and against the man that is
[59:50] my fellow and saith the Lord of Hosts
[59:52] smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall
[59:55] be scattered and that's what happened
[59:57] when they smote the Shepherd they put
[59:59] him on Calvary we read the quote this
[1:00:00] morning the sheep was scattered what
[1:00:02] Israel was scattered dispersed they were
[1:00:04] told in the Bible that if you don't do
[1:00:06] what God said I'm gonna send you into
[1:00:08] every nation and you're gonna suffer
[1:00:10] your heart think about six and a half
[1:00:14] million you know the population of
[1:00:17] Georgia is only like 12 million so half
[1:00:19] of this whole state of Georgia
[1:00:21] six-and-a-half million people
[1:00:24] children mothers fathers old people
[1:00:27] didn't matter they put them in a gas
[1:00:29] chamber just because they were Jews just
[1:00:33] because they were do nothing else they
[1:00:35] had not sinned against nobody as far as
[1:00:37] natural but they sinned against God a
[1:00:40] long time ago and they're paying for
[1:00:42] their sin just like you and I would do
[1:00:45] the same thing number five there be so
[1:00:49] ashamed of their self when they stand
[1:00:51] there and see that very one that they
[1:00:52] crucified in the night standing there
[1:00:54] our precious own Joseph there'll be such
[1:00:57] morning they'll say where did you get
[1:00:59] those scars he's sitting in the house of
[1:01:00] my friends see what I mean to make an
[1:01:02] end of sin of unbelief that was that's
[1:01:06] what he's coming for and I said before
[1:01:09] if you can't remember in your journey
[1:01:11] where you come to justification where
[1:01:13] you realize you were wrong you had
[1:01:16] transgressed against God and you were
[1:01:18] like way out there somewhere well when
[1:01:21] he extended your arm you took it well he
[1:01:25] finished your transgression if he still
[1:01:29] remembers what you did in your past
[1:01:31] you're not saved but if you're saved
[1:01:35] thank God because he had to what he had
[1:01:38] to finish their sin pre-poo prophets he
[1:01:40] had to preach to justify them now we're
[1:01:44] looking at sanctification where they
[1:01:46] come to a place to where their eyes come
[1:01:48] open so much to us amen I'm the one who
[1:01:51] put him on that cross that was the
[1:01:53] mossad that was the one we were looking
[1:01:55] for and I did it no no no your your your
[1:01:58] you know your ancestors to town no their
[1:02:01] 144,000 they're gonna get a updated
[1:02:04] revelation I'm the one that put him on a
[1:02:07] cross because you and I can say the same
[1:02:09] thing I put him on that cross cuz he
[1:02:13] died for me
[1:02:14] and then you died for you so you keep on
[1:02:17] going a little bit further coming to
[1:02:19] make an ender stand put it away
[1:02:21] what's the first to finish the
[1:02:23] transgression then make an end of sin
[1:02:25] then we're talking about number three to
[1:02:26] make reconciliation for iniquity okay
[1:02:29] let's go to the next part but we're
[1:02:32] talking about sanctification red blood
[1:02:34] red horse rider we can put all these I
[1:02:36] can put all these six fold purpose in
[1:02:38] the six seals there's your white horse
[1:02:39] red horse black horse because the black
[1:02:42] horse is what the new birth you die
[1:02:44] they're gonna have to die to be
[1:02:47] reconciled because you know what they
[1:02:49] can't be made to - you can't be mad at
[1:02:52] the devil married to God - that old
[1:02:54] party who's got to be dead da-ad Black
[1:02:58] dead I'm talking about that as dead as
[1:03:00] dead is not if you're not dead then
[1:03:03] you're still alive it's to you Paul said
[1:03:06] it's not all that liveth but it's Christ
[1:03:09] that liveth in me
[1:03:10] amen twice what they're gonna say
[1:03:12] they're gonna realize Christ died for
[1:03:14] them that he has caused it listen you
[1:03:17] got to have a revelation that God took
[1:03:20] your sins away because you still
[1:03:23] remember him Satan still remembers them
[1:03:26] his little imps and his little demons
[1:03:29] still reminds you every day but you got
[1:03:32] to come to a revelation that he has
[1:03:35] finished your transgression he's made an
[1:03:38] end of your sin that's a revelation that
[1:03:40] just like standing up saying I'm saying
[1:03:42] while I'm justifying the real me didn't
[1:03:46] do it
[1:03:46] I'm gonna go from smoking pot and drink
[1:03:49] a beer because the real me didn't do it
[1:03:51] no you're lost you need saved let's go
[1:03:53] back to justification because the old
[1:03:57] use not dead yet but if you'll do it
[1:04:01] right if you'll do it right look at the
[1:04:04] woman at the well she was a at
[1:04:08] five six six six husbands got cleaned
[1:04:13] her up so he can clean you in a minute
[1:04:17] listen there's no difference in the
[1:04:18] prostitute a murderer and whoremonger
[1:04:20] it's all sin you disbelieve the Word of
[1:04:25] God is just as bad as that
[1:04:27] because you know what you're doing if
[1:04:28] you still if you're still alive and
[1:04:30] Christ is not alive in your life that's
[1:04:32] what you're doing you're prostituting
[1:04:34] yourself out to the devil that's why
[1:04:36] we're all under that part we all
[1:04:38] prostituted ourselves out to the devil
[1:04:41] amen that's pretty hard but it's the
[1:04:43] truth all right number three is to make
[1:04:46] reconciliation for iniquity to cover to
[1:04:50] purge we brought in and make an
[1:04:52] atonement on that day of atonement we're
[1:04:55] reading maybe we read it now no maybe we
[1:04:58] read a little bit later but when you
[1:04:59] come to that day of atonement it was a
[1:05:01] morning for the killed what they're
[1:05:03] gonna do they're not gonna mourn that
[1:05:05] Christ died here no you read where it
[1:05:07] says where did you get those scars in
[1:05:09] the house of my friends they'll realize
[1:05:11] 2,000 years ago they put him on the
[1:05:13] cross you got to realize 2,000 years ago
[1:05:16] that he made an atonement once for you
[1:05:19] and when you accept that atonement it's
[1:05:23] just like what just like a pardon a
[1:05:26] pardon is not a pardon until it's
[1:05:28] accepted as a pardon the pardon is there
[1:05:31] I wish we'd realize these things that
[1:05:34] yeah I was thinking the other day you
[1:05:35] know we somebody was yakking about you
[1:05:42] know the people that if you like blow
[1:05:44] point one eight you're drunk now they're
[1:05:47] gonna change it down to 0.08 and all
[1:05:50] everybody's in an uproar you know why it
[1:05:52] didn't bother me one bit
[1:05:53] that you don't need to you did you chime
[1:05:56] in and and tell the people are boy the
[1:05:58] government's just you know why that law
[1:06:01] has no effect on me they could go to
[1:06:05] point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
[1:06:08] that's right be but see it you
[1:06:12] understand what I'm saying so there's
[1:06:13] laws we got laws all these different
[1:06:15] things but if you're not put under that
[1:06:17] law if you don't drink and drive
[1:06:20] it doesn't matter they go to having one
[1:06:25] in your car doesn't matter the man you
[1:06:27] know what that didn't scare me a bit
[1:06:29] shouldn't scare you either we get scared
[1:06:34] all these laws and stuff didn't reef
[1:06:37] don't remember we all were under the law
[1:06:40] until Christ came to what make
[1:06:43] reconciliation so to make reconciliation
[1:06:45] for their iniquity he's going to in this
[1:06:49] 1260 days he's going to reconcile and I
[1:06:52] read it before in Corinthians about
[1:06:55] reconciliation let's skip to that
[1:06:57] because it's okay iniquity is doing
[1:06:59] wrong as they did at the cross he made
[1:07:01] reconciliation but it will not be
[1:07:03] applied to them it wasn't applied back
[1:07:05] here on the day of Pentecost it got
[1:07:07] applied 120 in the upper room they
[1:07:10] applied that atonement they believed
[1:07:13] that Christ died for them and got filled
[1:07:15] with the Holy Ghost acts 2:38 but it but
[1:07:18] now remember he don't have to get back
[1:07:19] on the cross over here to redeem Israel
[1:07:22] he did it back here it was a pardon but
[1:07:26] it wasn't accepted as a pardon until
[1:07:28] right here they're going to what open
[1:07:30] the eyes of the 144,000 to realize that
[1:07:35] they've already been you and I gotta
[1:07:38] realize that Christ don't have to get
[1:07:42] back on the cross you hadn't got to go
[1:07:43] do 25 Hail Marys and go see the priest
[1:07:48] it was not applied to them why because
[1:07:50] they were blinded and could not see it
[1:07:53] let's skip on down let's read second
[1:07:56] Corinthians go out like that therefore
[1:07:57] if any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:07:59] creature and that's what's gonna happen
[1:08:00] to learn in 44,000 listen they're gonna
[1:08:03] be right here right before the the body
[1:08:06] change in the rapture they're gonna be
[1:08:08] you're not going to be able to tell them
[1:08:09] from the other Orthodox Jews they don't
[1:08:14] believe Christ like no there's nobody in
[1:08:16] Jews and jewelry now that believes that
[1:08:18] Christ died for the sins if not they'd
[1:08:20] be a Christian big difference so what's
[1:08:24] going to happen is right here God's
[1:08:25] gonna literally lift his hand by these
[1:08:29] two prophets just like he did you
[1:08:31] through a preacher through somebody
[1:08:32] telling you about God's Word it's not
[1:08:35] that he had to write something new well
[1:08:38] now Louise says Lisa's coming to the
[1:08:40] Lord I need to write about revelations
[1:08:42] 24 because he's coming in now that was
[1:08:44] already there revelations 22 revelations
[1:08:50] 20 everything was already there what
[1:08:51] happened to you God just lifted his hand
[1:08:54] away and that's the same thing he did
[1:08:56] with these two prophets for these
[1:08:58] hundred 44,000 he'll have to write a new
[1:09:00] Bible he don't have to write a new
[1:09:01] anything he just takes our blinders off
[1:09:05] so that we can see who see Christ not
[1:09:08] see them two witnesses they'll see
[1:09:10] Christ that's what we want to see now we
[1:09:12] want to see Christ in this ministry
[1:09:15] therefore if any man be in Christ is a
[1:09:16] new creature old things are passed away
[1:09:19] behold all things are become new
[1:09:20] and all things are of God who hath
[1:09:22] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:09:24] and that's given us the Ministry of
[1:09:28] reconciliation so got to come through a
[1:09:31] ministry to wit that God was in Christ
[1:09:33] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:09:35] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[1:09:38] have committed unto us the word of
[1:09:41] reconciliation so we have today the word
[1:09:45] of reconciliation and then now we look
[1:09:48] to keep go to the next one says that's
[1:09:49] the atonement so you got look right here
[1:09:52] you got justification and sanctification
[1:09:53] and baptism Holy Ghost that reconciles
[1:09:55] you back to Christ clothes reconcile
[1:09:57] means to take apart
[1:09:58] he made an atonement so that you
[1:10:01] what-what happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:04] there was a separation God couldn't talk
[1:10:08] day-to-day without him like he used to
[1:10:10] while there was sin in the picture but
[1:10:13] it's got to come back where God came
[1:10:15] down in human flesh in the second Adam
[1:10:17] and took that away already you just
[1:10:19] gotta get the blinders off your eyes to
[1:10:22] see what he's already done and he's
[1:10:24] wrecking he's give us a word and a
[1:10:26] Ministry of reconciliation that you're
[1:10:30] listening to now everybody okay say Amen
[1:10:35] revelations 11 well let's go to oh wait
[1:10:39] it's a Quran I don't get too far ahead
[1:10:41] and she'll come to pass in that day I
[1:10:43] will seek to destroy all the nations
[1:10:44] that come against Jerusalem and I will
[1:10:46] pour upon the house of David and upon
[1:10:48] the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[1:10:50] of grace and supplication now remember
[1:10:52] that's going to begin here and go
[1:10:54] through all this 1260 days because God's
[1:10:57] getting ready to take 144,000 out and
[1:11:01] that he's going to protect that city
[1:11:03] listen he's still protecting it now this
[1:11:06] world
[1:11:07] would love to see Jerusalem flattened
[1:11:10] most people in this world would love to
[1:11:13] see Jerusalem completely destroyed well
[1:11:17] God's got his hand on them because
[1:11:20] that's his city and that's his people
[1:11:22] and then that's why that's why the folks
[1:11:25] the judgment will not strike this world
[1:11:27] until we're out of here
[1:11:28] this little pre stuff we're getting now
[1:11:30] ain't nothing to be compared to when we
[1:11:32] get out of here the wrath of God is
[1:11:34] going to be poured out on this nation
[1:11:37] and just pray to God that you got the
[1:11:40] new birth and you won't be here and I
[1:11:43] will pour upon the house of David upon
[1:11:45] the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[1:11:46] of grace and of supplication and they
[1:11:48] shall look upon me whom they have
[1:11:50] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[1:11:53] one mourning for his only son and shall
[1:11:56] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[1:11:57] bitterness for the firstborn in that day
[1:12:00] shall there be a great mourning in
[1:12:02] Jerusalem as the mourning of had a
[1:12:04] remand in the valley of megiddo battle
[1:12:06] of armageddon is going to be in that
[1:12:08] very battle be in that very valley of
[1:12:11] megiddo about that and the land shall
[1:12:14] mourn every family apart we read that
[1:12:17] this morning so let's go to the next
[1:12:18] comment I got here for three processes
[1:12:21] brother instead completes the birth
[1:12:22] let's go to the very next where it says
[1:12:24] three processes right there three
[1:12:26] processes completes the birth so we come
[1:12:28] right here to this part of the twelve
[1:12:31] hundred and sixty days because when you
[1:12:34] reconcile listen when you when you in
[1:12:37] Christ or reconcile you're going through
[1:12:39] a daily journey but you've got a statue
[1:12:41] of a perfect man they're not promised in
[1:12:43] you that they're promised to get the
[1:12:46] Holy Ghost and then they're gonna take a
[1:12:49] rapture well they're gonna be killed and
[1:12:50] then they're gonna take a rapture
[1:12:51] alright that's their promise that's I
[1:12:53] promise cuz I sent a New Testament they
[1:12:57] don't believe in you they ain't got time
[1:12:59] they only got three and a half years to
[1:13:01] get it all to just get born again but
[1:13:04] that's all God wanted of them that's all
[1:13:07] God wants for them that's all he
[1:13:08] requires of them is to get more and
[1:13:10] again and go to justification
[1:13:11] sanctification and to reconcile where he
[1:13:13] can now talk to that 144,000 just like
[1:13:19] you talks to me and you know
[1:13:21] no no this bride we know that no this
[1:13:24] bride
[1:13:24] no no this bride but he still he can't
[1:13:28] kill that tree that's his tree the olive
[1:13:32] tree is his tree he can't cut it down
[1:13:34] that's the Jews so I we referred to
[1:13:37] through the chart but look I like these
[1:13:39] three words finish I'm glad God finished
[1:13:41] my transgression I'm glad you made an
[1:13:44] end of my sin and reconcile me back to
[1:13:46] Christ that's exactly what we go through
[1:13:47] is exactly what they got to go through
[1:13:49] it everybody got that alright so now
[1:13:52] let's go to revelations 11 if we don't
[1:13:56] get done I'll finish next Sunday I'd
[1:13:59] like to get finished today though but
[1:14:00] that's okay now we going back to the
[1:14:03] revelations 11 this is the promise of
[1:14:06] these two witnesses but watch what
[1:14:07] they're going to do everybody okay watch
[1:14:10] what they're going to do cuz I left this
[1:14:14] off for the first piece that when we
[1:14:16] read revelations 11 now we're gonna read
[1:14:18] 1 through 13 and there was given me a
[1:14:20] reed like a rod and the angel stood
[1:14:22] saying rise measure the temple of God
[1:14:25] and the altar and them that worship
[1:14:29] therein but the court which is without
[1:14:30] the temple leave out and measure it not
[1:14:33] for it is given unto the Gentile and the
[1:14:35] Holy City shall they tread under foot
[1:14:37] forty and two months
[1:14:38] all right forty-two months this is the
[1:14:41] position I'm reading to you right now 42
[1:14:43] months nobody got that all right now
[1:14:49] we'll give power unto my two witnesses
[1:14:51] and they shall prophesy 1260 days thirty
[1:14:57] times two clothed in sackcloth so that's
[1:15:00] that's the time that they're going to
[1:15:02] have to preach to the Jews according to
[1:15:06] the Bible to bring out 144,000 now these
[1:15:12] are the two olive trees and the two
[1:15:14] candlesticks standing before the god of
[1:15:16] the earth so we know there's two of them
[1:15:18] and if any man shall hurt them fire
[1:15:20] proceedeth out of their mouth now
[1:15:22] they're not gonna have a flame thrower
[1:15:23] going out of our mouth that's a type
[1:15:28] it's the word it's the sword it's the
[1:15:30] it's the fire proceeding out of their
[1:15:32] mouth saying no you're not going to
[1:15:34] touch
[1:15:35] boom you're out of here you know or
[1:15:36] whatever you know is there they're just
[1:15:37] gonna be able to control nature because
[1:15:39] the sixth seal opens are during this
[1:15:41] time not even been talking about that
[1:15:43] maybe we're later if any man will hurt
[1:15:46] them fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[1:15:48] and devours their enemies and if any man
[1:15:51] will hurt them he must be in this manner
[1:15:53] be killed if somebody throws a rock at
[1:15:56] them they like to throw rocks over there
[1:15:57] their stone throwers alright Levi's tows
[1:16:01] a rock get them to witnesses and hurts
[1:16:03] them Bible says they die so they're
[1:16:06] pretty - very serious guys you know why
[1:16:08] they've only got a certain length of
[1:16:10] time stay alive and I'm sure they know
[1:16:13] that when that revelation comes to them
[1:16:16] two prophets they're gonna look in
[1:16:18] Revelations 11 and say all right that's
[1:16:20] us well we got 1260 days let's get
[1:16:23] started alright they have power to shut
[1:16:28] heaven that it rain not in the days of
[1:16:30] their prophecy which same with Elijah
[1:16:32] and have power over waters to turn them
[1:16:34] to blood which was Moses and to smite
[1:16:37] the earth with all plagues as often as
[1:16:39] they will and when they shall have
[1:16:42] finished their testimony look right here
[1:16:45] look at me when they have finished their
[1:16:46] testimony they've got to preach 1260
[1:16:49] days but when they finish their
[1:16:53] testimony the Beast that ascends out of
[1:16:56] the bottomless pit shall make war
[1:16:57] against them and shall overcome them and
[1:17:00] kill them if I got that say men and
[1:17:04] their dead bodies shall lie in the
[1:17:06] street of the great city which
[1:17:08] spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt
[1:17:09] where our Lord was crucified think about
[1:17:12] seeing in all the cable news all the TVs
[1:17:16] all the man the coach the media is gonna
[1:17:18] be there anyway the one of these two
[1:17:20] guys that can if they want it to snow
[1:17:22] ten feet deep all they do is say snow or
[1:17:25] somebody tries to bother him they say
[1:17:26] dead while you know that all the media
[1:17:29] outlets cuz that's what it says watch
[1:17:31] and of the people in kindred and tongue
[1:17:33] and nation shall see see to television
[1:17:41] they will see you through television
[1:17:43] they'll see their dead bodies three days
[1:17:46] and a half and shall not
[1:17:48] suffer their dead bodies to be put in
[1:17:50] the grave why they want to humiliate
[1:17:51] them they finally killed him and who
[1:17:53] killed him that great who's that guy
[1:17:55] right there that descended out of the
[1:17:56] bottomless pit that's Satan through the
[1:17:58] Pope when he comes in and breaks that
[1:18:00] covenant God said okay we're finished
[1:18:02] now do with them once you wish and they
[1:18:06] that dwell on the earth shall rejoice
[1:18:07] over them and make merry the whole earth
[1:18:09] they listen they're not going just
[1:18:11] torment Israel they're going torn
[1:18:14] because remember like I said the CIA all
[1:18:16] these different don't you think they're
[1:18:19] all gonna try to kill them way over here
[1:18:21] but they got 1260 days they cannot be
[1:18:24] touched and they that dwell upon the
[1:18:27] earth shall rejoice over them and make
[1:18:28] merry and shall send gifts one to
[1:18:30] another because these two prophets
[1:18:31] tormented them that dwelt on the earth
[1:18:34] not just Jerusalem on the earth and
[1:18:36] after three days and a half the spirit
[1:18:38] of life from God entered into them and
[1:18:40] they stood up now what about that three
[1:18:42] days in Jerusalem in that hot Sun ain't
[1:18:46] gonna be pretty
[1:18:47] but all of a sudden the cameras are
[1:18:51] going to be turned on them and here they
[1:18:55] go and stand right up and they stood
[1:19:00] upon their feet and great fear fell upon
[1:19:02] them which saw them and they heard a
[1:19:06] great voice from heaven saying unto them
[1:19:08] come up hither so somewhere in that time
[1:19:10] the 144,000 were killed - because it
[1:19:13] looks like they all gonna come up in a
[1:19:15] resurrection alright and they heard a
[1:19:17] great voice from heaven saying come up
[1:19:18] hither see we already heard that voice
[1:19:20] we heard that voice in Revelations for
[1:19:23] when we went to resurrection we heard
[1:19:25] that same voice right there that was the
[1:19:27] voice of the resurrection this is the
[1:19:30] voice of the resurrection
[1:19:31] and they heard a great voice from heaven
[1:19:32] saying unto them come up hither and they
[1:19:35] ascended up to heaven in a cloud and
[1:19:36] their enemies beheld then what a
[1:19:38] wonderment I can see the television
[1:19:40] cameras going or just be looking at them
[1:19:45] and they just disappear in the same hour
[1:19:48] there was a great earthquake what's
[1:19:49] beginning to start listen when they go
[1:19:52] up in a rapture folks there is ZERO Holy
[1:19:54] Ghost on this earth there's not a person
[1:19:57] in this world of seven probably billion
[1:20:00] people at that time
[1:20:01] we'll have the baptism of Holy Ghost so
[1:20:03] there's no holding back this is the
[1:20:05] total wrath of God being poured out on
[1:20:08] the world in the same hour where there
[1:20:10] was a great earthquake and a tenth part
[1:20:11] of the city fell and then the earthquake
[1:20:13] were slain of men seven thousand and the
[1:20:15] remnant were affrighted and gave glory
[1:20:17] to the God of heaven so right here is
[1:20:20] your battle of Armageddon in the midst
[1:20:21] of the week when he terminates that
[1:20:23] contract with them in the middle of the
[1:20:26] week comes the Battle of Armageddon so
[1:20:28] let's go to Daniel 12 verse 1 and at
[1:20:32] that time shall Michael stand up the
[1:20:34] Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:20:35] children of thy people and there shall
[1:20:38] be a time of trouble such as never was
[1:20:40] since there was a nation now keep in
[1:20:42] mind we still got three folds to finish
[1:20:46] we still got three folds to finish you
[1:20:49] can't finish them over here there's got
[1:20:51] to be this going on and then this
[1:20:53] happens
[1:20:54] we'll read that in just a second and
[1:20:57] many of them that slept over I'm sorry
[1:20:59] such as never was since there was a
[1:21:01] nation even to that same time and at
[1:21:04] that time thy people now who is thy
[1:21:08] people
[1:21:09] Daniel and thy people you and I are
[1:21:13] already gone the church is coming the
[1:21:16] brides already he's not drawn by the
[1:21:17] bride he's talking about Israel the
[1:21:23] 144,000 at that time thy people shall be
[1:21:26] delivered every one that shall be found
[1:21:27] written in the book you notice it didn't
[1:21:30] say in the Lamb's Book of Life the
[1:21:33] Lamb's Book of Life is the bride only
[1:21:36] eternal section the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:21:38] is a bride only it's not 244,000 all
[1:21:41] right but he said it was written in the
[1:21:43] book see why if we read the Bible we get
[1:21:45] it right you read the Bible you get it
[1:21:47] right all right and many of them now
[1:21:51] watch this is gonna of what's gonna
[1:21:52] happen is and many of them that sleep in
[1:21:54] the dust of the earth shall awake some
[1:21:55] to everlasting life something to shame
[1:21:57] now what happened is that's not gonna
[1:21:58] happen right here God's just telling us
[1:22:02] what's going to happen so there's no
[1:22:05] resurrection right here now there's no
[1:22:06] Bible for that brother Branham even
[1:22:07] tells us in the rapture how many
[1:22:09] different resurrections they are or how
[1:22:11] many raptures it's not a rapture to
[1:22:13] Balam Armageddon except that
[1:22:15] witnesses they're already gone they're
[1:22:16] gone we've already they're already left
[1:22:18] they've left them they've left the earth
[1:22:20] so there's not another rep there's not
[1:22:22] anybody gonna be resurrected in here
[1:22:24] that didn't watch look it says and many
[1:22:28] of them that slept in the dust of the
[1:22:30] earth shall awake some to everlasting
[1:22:31] life and some to shame and everlasting
[1:22:34] contempt he's talking about over here
[1:22:36] it's the white throne judgment and they
[1:22:39] that be wise shall shine as the
[1:22:41] brightness of the firmament firmament
[1:22:43] and they that turn many to righteousness
[1:22:45] as the stars for ever and ever but Thou
[1:22:48] O Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:22:51] book even to the time of the end many
[1:22:54] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:22:55] be increased then I Daniel looked and
[1:22:57] behold there stood other two the one on
[1:23:00] this side of the bank of the river and
[1:23:01] the one on the other side of the bank
[1:23:02] rivers kind of strangest to two
[1:23:06] witnesses okay got it at once said to
[1:23:11] the man clothed in linen which was upon
[1:23:12] the waters of the river what is waters
[1:23:15] people how long shall it be to the end
[1:23:18] of these wonders and I heard the man
[1:23:21] clothed in linen which was upon the
[1:23:22] water of the river when he held up his
[1:23:23] right hand and his left hand unto heaven
[1:23:26] and swear by him that liveth now this is
[1:23:29] revelations 10 happening in the Book of
[1:23:31] Daniel but remember in Revelations 10 he
[1:23:34] puts one for the land one for don't see
[1:23:36] water lifts his hand and said time shall
[1:23:40] be no longer that's you and I that's for
[1:23:43] the Gentiles that we don't have a time
[1:23:45] we don't have a date we don't have a
[1:23:47] time but they do they have exactly what
[1:23:50] it's saying right here swear by him that
[1:23:52] liveth forever it shall be for a time
[1:23:57] times and a dividing of times 1260 days
[1:24:04] or three and a half years right and when
[1:24:07] he shall have accomplished to scatter
[1:24:08] the power of the holy people all these
[1:24:11] things shall be finished and I heard but
[1:24:15] I understood not they said I O Lord what
[1:24:18] shall be the end of these things he said
[1:24:21] go thy way Daniel for the words are
[1:24:22] closed up and sealed till the time of
[1:24:25] the end you and I are fulfilling that
[1:24:28] Scripture right there you and I are
[1:24:31] living in that Scripture this day this
[1:24:34] scripture is being fulfilled in front of
[1:24:37] your eyes many shall be purified and
[1:24:39] made white and tried but the wicked
[1:24:40] shall do wickedly none of the wicked
[1:24:43] shall understand but the wise shall
[1:24:46] understand what a promise alright let's
[1:24:51] start with number four I'm not gonna
[1:24:52] keep it too long list we have to just do
[1:24:54] but I want to do number four at least to
[1:24:56] get you going onto the other side of
[1:24:58] this 1260 days everybody okay amen
[1:25:03] number four to bring in everlasting
[1:25:05] righteousness
[1:25:07] now watch that's the fourth thing that
[1:25:10] he came for the fourth what did he come
[1:25:13] to do to bring in everlasting
[1:25:14] righteousness make an end ascend
[1:25:16] reconciliation and to bring in
[1:25:18] everlasting righteousness when Israel's
[1:25:21] transgression had come to an end now
[1:25:24] when does their transgression come to an
[1:25:27] end here here they're going in rapture
[1:25:35] alright
[1:25:36] when is this transgression had come to
[1:25:39] an end when Israel's transgression now
[1:25:41] we're going to I want you to catch this
[1:25:43] because when we bring that woman and the
[1:25:45] Dragon cast out you're going to come
[1:25:47] right back to this scripture again be
[1:25:49] sure to put it down when Israel's
[1:25:51] transgression has come to an end Satan
[1:25:54] who is their accuser and our accuser
[1:25:56] Satan will be sealed up in the
[1:25:58] bottomless pit when what when bringing
[1:26:01] in everlasting righteousness something
[1:26:03] that come on in so so so it's gonna
[1:26:06] happen over here Satan is going to be
[1:26:09] sealed up for
[1:26:10] here he gonna be sealing up over here
[1:26:13] somewhere like I said it's an overlap
[1:26:15] he's gonna be sick because you can't
[1:26:17] bring in everlasting righteousness while
[1:26:19] Satan's running all over the world right
[1:26:25] think sensible Satan is going to be
[1:26:29] bound because look like I said before
[1:26:31] this battle of Armageddon nobody but
[1:26:33] sinners left demons devil
[1:26:37] there's no Christian people left but to
[1:26:41] bring in everlasting righteousness is
[1:26:42] when they put him in the bottomless pit
[1:26:44] because we're going to somewhere in here
[1:26:47] that 144,000 has got to come back I
[1:26:50] don't have scripture for it well I do
[1:26:53] but I don't have a quote for it but I do
[1:26:56] that they gotta come back and build a
[1:26:59] temple you can't bring in everlasting
[1:27:00] righteousness in this time period right
[1:27:03] here cuz how you gonna bring in
[1:27:07] everlasting righteousness one more time
[1:27:08] and then have a battle of Armageddon
[1:27:11] okay so it's got to happen after the
[1:27:14] Battle of Armageddon when everything's
[1:27:16] dead everything's gone
[1:27:18] Satan has become powerless because what
[1:27:20] he's putting that bottomless pit cuz now
[1:27:23] everything it walks that earth this hunt
[1:27:25] all amen
[1:27:26] this 144,000 I just saw that there's
[1:27:29] hundred forty-four thousand and the
[1:27:30] bride are gonna be walking on this earth
[1:27:35] and Satan's gonna have to be down here
[1:27:38] because he's got nothing to work in up
[1:27:39] here he's got a lot to work in up here
[1:27:42] oh they gonna kill him too prophets I
[1:27:44] just read it but when that Battle of
[1:27:46] Armageddon comes something's going to
[1:27:49] happen kill everybody that's the center
[1:27:53] and then everlasting righteousness
[1:27:58] 144,000 and whoever we got they're
[1:28:00] coming in they gonna come back to earth
[1:28:02] then they're gonna build something for
[1:28:04] us to come back everlasting
[1:28:07] righteousness watch this number four be
[1:28:13] sure to put it down when Israel's
[1:28:14] transgression has come to an end Satan
[1:28:16] who is their accuser and our accuser
[1:28:19] Satan will be sealed up in the
[1:28:21] bottomless pit when what when bringing
[1:28:23] in every
[1:28:24] in righteousness something that cannot
[1:28:26] end all because unrighteousness will be
[1:28:30] done away with
[1:28:32] how're you gonna do that right here if
[1:28:35] there's only three and a half years left
[1:28:37] after the rapture as most people
[1:28:38] ninety-nine percent of the people the
[1:28:40] best is preached
[1:28:41] I said 99 I mean it no other ministers
[1:28:45] know I'm telling the truth but how can
[1:28:48] that happen according to the Bible
[1:28:51] because my final resting place is this
[1:28:53] Bible that puts it together for me okay
[1:28:56] cuz quotes will kill you you know what
[1:28:59] killed Jesus you know what killed Jesus
[1:29:03] Moses is quote Moses that they had Moses
[1:29:08] quote book and that's what killed Jesus
[1:29:11] huh a sinner didn't kill Jesus well
[1:29:16] technically he did but the center of my
[1:29:18] sin killed him but who actually was the
[1:29:20] one that was against him the priests the
[1:29:23] people that read Moses quote book we
[1:29:28] have Abraham as our Father Jesus said
[1:29:31] you don't have the same daddy I do if
[1:29:36] you don't know Abraham you know me
[1:29:39] what he was telling them is your quotes
[1:29:40] are killing you I tell you that's what's
[1:29:45] killing people now the quotes that we
[1:29:47] that I save and contend that you think
[1:29:50] are different and wrong and I don't if
[1:29:56] you can bring a major doctrine and not
[1:29:58] have to throw quotes out if you can take
[1:30:00] every close take everybody every Bible
[1:30:03] every just while I'm bringing you we're
[1:30:05] walking right through this last week by
[1:30:08] the Bible and the prophets message then
[1:30:12] I have no problem I I got plenty to
[1:30:14] stand on because I'm going to stand on
[1:30:15] the Word of God and then hmm and
[1:30:18] righteousness will be done away with
[1:30:20] let's read revelations 20 listen can we
[1:30:22] go about 15 more minutes
[1:30:25] revelations 20 verse 1 and I saw an
[1:30:27] angel come down from heaven having the
[1:30:29] key of the bottomless pit and a great
[1:30:30] chain in his hand and he laid hold on
[1:30:33] the dragon that old serpent which is the
[1:30:35] devil and Satan and bound him up
[1:30:37] thousand years and cast him into the
[1:30:39] bottomless pit and shut him up and put a
[1:30:41] sail on him that he should deceive the
[1:30:44] nation's No More till the thousand years
[1:30:47] should be fulfilled and after that he
[1:30:49] must be loosed a little season
[1:30:52] let's read Ibaka to brother Brown reads
[1:30:56] this talking about bringing in
[1:30:57] everlasting righteousness watch woe to
[1:31:00] him that buildeth the town Habakkuk 2
[1:31:02] verse 2 12 14 woe to him that buildeth
[1:31:04] the town with blood and stablished a
[1:31:06] city by iniquity behold it is not of the
[1:31:09] Lord of hosts that the people shall
[1:31:10] labor in the very fire and the people
[1:31:12] shall weary themselves for very Manatee
[1:31:14] but the earth shall be filled with the
[1:31:17] knowledge of the glory of the Lord as
[1:31:19] the waters cover the sea how in the
[1:31:22] world is that gonna happen right here no
[1:31:23] it's gonna happen right here all right
[1:31:25] number eight oh my he says in other
[1:31:32] words when the enemy has been put away
[1:31:34] the end of sin has come the bringing in
[1:31:37] of everlasting righteousness that come
[1:31:39] now how is that gonna happen right here
[1:31:41] one more time look over this way how's
[1:31:44] that gonna happen right here okay happen
[1:31:46] according to the Bible can't happen
[1:31:48] God happened over here so it's got to be
[1:31:50] time left all right that's what I mean
[1:31:54] that 6-volt purpose we'll just explain
[1:31:56] everything if you'll just let it and
[1:31:57] you'll quit running quotes through your
[1:31:59] brain that's our problem quotes will
[1:32:02] kill you the bringing of everlasting
[1:32:05] righteousness has come Satan is sealed
[1:32:07] up in the bottomless pit this is the six
[1:32:09] fold purpose and the knowledge of the
[1:32:11] Lord shall cover the earth as the waters
[1:32:12] cover the sea amen glory to god it's
[1:32:15] coming brother it's coming women will be
[1:32:17] ladies and men will be gentlemen amen
[1:32:19] then he starts singing the song when the
[1:32:21] knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[1:32:22] earth to see in the sky oh my heart is
[1:32:24] groaning crying for that day of sweet
[1:32:26] release when our Jesus shall come back
[1:32:28] to earth again
[1:32:29] look all right now the Millennium then
[1:32:31] is on you see that so it's gonna happen
[1:32:36] right here cain't gotta happen over here
[1:32:43] what I'm telling you we just face final
[1:32:45] resting places in the Bible
[1:32:47] now the millenniums in his own that's
[1:32:49] when the millennia
[1:32:50] when the city is to be built so are we
[1:32:55] gonna build a city here are they gonna
[1:32:57] build a city here they gotta build a
[1:32:59] city here the city's got to be rebuilt
[1:33:00] over here it can't be rebuilt here and
[1:33:02] then the Battle of Armageddon tear it
[1:33:03] down because remember the abomination
[1:33:07] that maketh desolate which is that
[1:33:08] mosque of Omar they're sitting over
[1:33:10] there on the Dome of the rock
[1:33:11] remember the prophet of God said they're
[1:33:13] gonna drop a bomb right down through the
[1:33:14] middle of it with less in the middle of
[1:33:16] Jerusalem like I said this morning it's
[1:33:17] going to destroy that whole city in an
[1:33:20] instant an atomic bomb they're not gonna
[1:33:22] drop a firecracker down the hole no it's
[1:33:26] gonna be a bomb an atomic bomb but thank
[1:33:30] God will not be around to see it all
[1:33:34] right now the Millennium is on that's
[1:33:36] when the Millennium when the city is to
[1:33:38] be built forth I had about six more
[1:33:39] scriptures but worry I will too let's go
[1:33:42] to number five seal up the vision and
[1:33:44] prophecy now this one you might think
[1:33:46] this one is a little bit out of place
[1:33:48] but it's right where it's supposed to be
[1:33:52] because brother Adam refers that the
[1:33:54] vision and all was sealed up until the
[1:33:57] time of the end but let me let me get
[1:34:00] something to you a little fault that I
[1:34:02] had here mm-hmm well we have still up
[1:34:05] the vision and prophecy number nine what
[1:34:07] is it oh hallelujah do you see it class
[1:34:09] this revelation of Jesus Christ and of
[1:34:12] his power of his coming at the end time
[1:34:14] was sealed up until now that's what he
[1:34:17] comes to do is hit from the scholars no
[1:34:19] one do they want to apply sealing it up
[1:34:20] back yonder to those prophets and
[1:34:23] everything way back it won't hold water
[1:34:25] but the vision this vision has been
[1:34:27] sealed until right now that's where I
[1:34:31] placed my faith that God will reveal
[1:34:33] them seventy weeks Amen seal it up till
[1:34:35] the end time close up the words and seal
[1:34:38] the book until the end time what did he
[1:34:41] do to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:34:42] Daniel had prophesized these things
[1:34:46] they've all been unsealed but when you
[1:34:49] come right back here it seals it up in a
[1:34:51] group of people you're sealed here
[1:34:56] they're sealed here but it seals up the
[1:34:59] vision the whole part of this is being
[1:35:02] played out and to seal it up
[1:35:04] wrote a little note here they know where
[1:35:07] they stand at that moment so you know
[1:35:10] where you stand when God reveals the
[1:35:11] word to you because you're gonna steal
[1:35:14] that vision and prophecy and you know
[1:35:15] why he's gonna do that because you're a
[1:35:18] bit you're gonna be a mystery people
[1:35:21] don't go understand you they don't
[1:35:22] understand us now they think we're crazy
[1:35:24] but that isn't it sealed up inside of us
[1:35:27] well it was still depend 144,000 now
[1:35:30] they've come back to seal up the vision
[1:35:32] and prophecy inside their self but
[1:35:35] they're getting ready to release it
[1:35:37] because they're gonna have to when you
[1:35:38] come to the number six watch so that's
[1:35:42] the real short one brother branham does
[1:35:43] not spend much time on that one at all
[1:35:45] so let's go to number six to a north the
[1:35:48] most holy we get to this one then we're
[1:35:50] good now all right
[1:35:53] got about 10 minutes before clock you
[1:35:55] should be okay y'all stand outside for
[1:35:56] two hours and talk after it's over with
[1:35:58] some anoint the most holy
[1:36:02] number six so we've come through the
[1:36:05] first tree to reconcile the the people
[1:36:08] now we've got to reconcile the temple
[1:36:12] and the building and the earth because
[1:36:13] that's what happens here bringing
[1:36:14] everlasting rocks and bringing we're
[1:36:17] bringing where on the earth we're coming
[1:36:21] back to this earth God's gonna watch our
[1:36:24] let man wipe it off then we're going to
[1:36:26] come back to it bring in everlasting
[1:36:29] righteousness seal up the vision and
[1:36:31] prophecy in those people cuz listen they
[1:36:34] gotta have a vision and prophecy to
[1:36:36] build that temple because you got to go
[1:36:37] back to Ezekiel 40 like what we're gonna
[1:36:40] read right here hang on number 10 now to
[1:36:43] anoint the most holy
[1:36:45] now folks this took a prophet to tell us
[1:36:48] this because the million years idea mine
[1:36:51] and your idea would be to anoint the
[1:36:53] most holy we would think that it would
[1:36:55] be go way back to the temple and all
[1:36:57] these other things that's know what it
[1:36:59] is he said it says to anoint the most
[1:37:02] holy and the most holy is not a building
[1:37:07] the most holy now I'll let him explain
[1:37:09] it now to anoint the most holy now this
[1:37:11] may be a little bit strange for just a
[1:37:13] minute to many of you teachers but just
[1:37:15] hold it for a minute let's see how it
[1:37:17] come
[1:37:18] this is the anointing not of a man Jesus
[1:37:23] is already anointed is that right the
[1:37:26] book of Acts said that God anointed
[1:37:27] Jesus with the Holy Ghost and went
[1:37:29] around doing good healing the stick and
[1:37:31] so forth Jesus is already he is Messiah
[1:37:34] Messiah means The Anointed One is that
[1:37:35] right but here at the end of time he's
[1:37:38] going north the most holy hmm oh are you
[1:37:42] gonna do it over here Kate gotta be over
[1:37:46] here whatever you think it's got to be
[1:37:52] over here it's got to be time well and
[1:37:54] I'll prove to you that there's time left
[1:37:56] anyway
[1:37:56] maybe next sending em cuz there's a hole
[1:38:00] if people don't even read Daniel 10 over
[1:38:03] in Daniel 10 and-and-and 11 I think it
[1:38:07] is hang on just a second
[1:38:14] I had it marked and I took it out this
[1:38:18] morning but I feel I need to read it
[1:38:20] that okay I'm gonna give you a bucket
[1:38:26] full right here it's not on here just
[1:38:29] hold what you got I'm gonna read it and
[1:38:30] I'll read it next Sunday we'll give you
[1:38:31] something to chew on cuz it's the
[1:38:33] continuation of Daniel 12 that we read a
[1:38:36] few minutes ago twelve nine says go thy
[1:38:39] way Daniel for the words are closed up
[1:38:41] and sealed to the time of the end many
[1:38:42] shall be purified white tribe but the
[1:38:44] wicked shall do wickedly and none of the
[1:38:46] wicked shall understand but the wise
[1:38:47] shall understand verse 11 and from the
[1:38:50] time that the daily sacrifice shall be
[1:38:52] taken away that right there hmm at the
[1:38:57] time of the day that sacrifice will be
[1:38:59] taken away watch this this is Bible and
[1:39:02] the abomination that maketh desolate set
[1:39:05] up there shall be 1290 days now that's
[1:39:13] there's 1260 that's 30 more days that's
[1:39:17] lapping you over into the Millennium oh
[1:39:19] that's not all
[1:39:20] blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to
[1:39:23] the 1,335 days put you way over
[1:39:30] into the Millennium huh how about that
[1:39:32] anyway let the Bible let's let the Bible
[1:39:36] do it for you amen so they see that
[1:39:39] she's got time right there read Daniel
[1:39:40] 12 if you want to but it puts you way
[1:39:43] past the 1260 days that all right what
[1:39:49] is the most holy to my way of seeing it
[1:39:50] okay pull it back up which I believe I
[1:39:53] can prove it by the scripture is to
[1:39:56] anoint the most holy which will be the
[1:39:58] tabernacle that will be used during the
[1:40:01] Millennium now is that here how you
[1:40:05] gonna build the tabernacle and then
[1:40:07] destroy it
[1:40:07] it's got to be over here Joyce at the
[1:40:11] last part of that last week everybody
[1:40:13] got it right then everybody believed
[1:40:14] what bro Graham said I do now listen and
[1:40:17] see why I get it described in Ezekiel
[1:40:20] the fourth chapter he didn't mean that
[1:40:22] he meant at the 43rd chapter the first
[1:40:25] was watch we're gonna read that let's go
[1:40:31] back to his ego and find out how he
[1:40:32] pictures it in the Millennium how they
[1:40:34] will anoint the Ezekiel 43 let's read it
[1:40:36] a little bit find out so let's go where
[1:40:41] it says afterwards paragraph 119 go you
[1:40:44] gotta go back to paragraph 119 there you
[1:40:51] go now this is the continual
[1:40:52] continuation of the quote from brother
[1:40:53] Branham now watch discrim description of
[1:40:57] the temple that is to be built in the
[1:40:59] Millennium now anyone any reader that
[1:41:02] knows from Ezekiel the fortieth chapter
[1:41:03] until the 44th chapters nothing in the
[1:41:06] world but the Lynn Millennial temple
[1:41:07] being erected on earth when the glory of
[1:41:11] the Lord fills it and so forth like that
[1:41:12] now we're gonna just describe the temple
[1:41:14] in the 43rd verse first 43rd chapter
[1:41:17] first to sixth verse listen now let's
[1:41:20] read Ezekiel 43 1 through 5 afterwards
[1:41:22] he brought me to the gate even to the
[1:41:24] gate that looketh toward the east winds
[1:41:29] Christ coming from the east and behold
[1:41:31] the glory of the God of Israel came from
[1:41:33] the way of the east and his voice was
[1:41:36] like the noise of many waters in the
[1:41:38] earth shined with his glory and it was
[1:41:40] according to the appearance of the
[1:41:41] vision which I saw even according to
[1:41:44] vision that I saw when I came to destroy
[1:41:46] the city and the visions were like the
[1:41:48] visions I saw by the river Chebar and I
[1:41:50] fell upon my face and the glory of the
[1:41:53] Lord came into the house by the way of
[1:41:54] the gate whose prospect is toward the
[1:41:58] east so the spirit took me up and
[1:42:00] brought me into the inner court and
[1:42:04] behold the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:42:08] house that's in Ezekiel that all rights
[1:42:10] they men know and then now look at
[1:42:12] Chronicles second chronicles 5 this is
[1:42:16] when Solomon brings the temple up and
[1:42:19] chronicles came to pass that the trumpet
[1:42:21] ears and singers words one to make one
[1:42:23] sound to be heard and praise and
[1:42:24] thanking the Lord when they lifted their
[1:42:26] voice with the trumpet and cymbals and
[1:42:28] instruments and music praising the Lord
[1:42:29] saying for he is good for his mercy
[1:42:31] endureth forever
[1:42:32] that then the house was filled with a
[1:42:35] cloud even the house of the Lord so that
[1:42:37] the priest could not stand to Minister
[1:42:38] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[1:42:41] the Lord had filled the house what
[1:42:42] brother bruh I'm saying is God's not
[1:42:44] gonna fill that house back again like
[1:42:45] that he's not gonna come in in the cloud
[1:42:49] he's coming in in flesh he's coming in
[1:42:55] flash thereby okay with that number
[1:43:00] eleven is six full purpose God came into
[1:43:02] the sanctuary that was to be anointed
[1:43:04] and was given over to him for the people
[1:43:06] to come to worship so to anoint not thy
[1:43:09] holy place but to anoint the most holy
[1:43:12] place and we notice that New Jerusalem
[1:43:15] is the most holy place and the anointing
[1:43:18] will be upon the New Jerusalem that
[1:43:21] descends from God out of heaven prepared
[1:43:23] as a bride adorned for a husband the
[1:43:27] anointing will be on them them that one
[1:43:34] zarubin will dedicate his temple after
[1:43:36] it was rebuilt it was not anointed again
[1:43:38] because it was already been anointed
[1:43:40] been tore down or just instructed again
[1:43:43] he meant it was destructed and they put
[1:43:47] it back together the destruction had
[1:43:49] come to it it had been instructed again
[1:43:51] and put up so there was no anointing of
[1:43:53] it anymore when it was one time anointed
[1:43:56] that carried
[1:43:57] on through and it goes on to this very
[1:43:59] time but when God sets up the Millennial
[1:44:02] tabernacle he will anoint the most holy
[1:44:05] not thy holy but the most holy but when
[1:44:09] the King takes his throne for 1,000
[1:44:11] years
[1:44:11] glory she's over now the anointing of
[1:44:14] the most holy will be the last thing
[1:44:16] take place when the tabernacle is
[1:44:19] erected the resurrection that's come now
[1:44:21] remember that's gonna happen inside
[1:44:22] Daniels 70 weeks because it's the six
[1:44:26] fold purpose this is where we're at
[1:44:27] right here all these six have got to
[1:44:31] happen inside of that last week when the
[1:44:37] tabernacle is erected the resurrection
[1:44:41] has come and we know that he's given a
[1:44:46] what a timeline the resurrection has
[1:44:48] come look look watch me the resurrection
[1:44:51] has come the Jews has returned Christ
[1:44:55] and his bride has come and the Jews and
[1:44:58] 144,000 are sealed the Millennium has

[1:46:30] I'm reading your Bible after these
[1:46:34] things I heard a voice of much people in
[1:46:36] heaven saying hallelujah salvation and
[1:46:38] glory and honor' power until the Lord
[1:46:40] our God for true and righteous are thy
[1:46:42] judgments for he had judged the great
[1:46:44] which did corrupt the earth with
[1:46:46] her fornication has avenged the blood of
[1:46:48] his servants at her hands and again he
[1:46:51] they and again they said Alleluia and
[1:46:53] her smoke rose up for ever and ever
[1:46:55] that's the old prostitute church her
[1:46:57] smoke rose up and the four and twenty
[1:46:59] elders and the four beasts fell down to
[1:47:01] worship God
[1:47:02] they said upon the throne saying amen
[1:47:04] hallelujah and the voice came out of the
[1:47:06] throne saying praise our God praise our
[1:47:08] God all you his Saints and you either
[1:47:10] fear Him both small and great and I
[1:47:13] heard it was the voice of a great
[1:47:14] multitude brother Brahm says listen here
[1:47:17] you are Church after she went up in the
[1:47:19] third chapter here she comes
[1:47:21] see and I heard as it were the voice of
[1:47:23] a great multitude as the voice of many
[1:47:25] waters and the voice of a mighty
[1:47:26] thunderings saying hallelujah for the
[1:47:29] Lord God omnipotent reigneth hallelujah
[1:47:30] watch the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:47:33] now here she comes
[1:47:34] let's be glad and rejoice and give
[1:47:36] honour to him for the marriage of the
[1:47:38] lamb has come and his wife not bride his
[1:47:41] wife had made herself ready
[1:47:46] here she comes both bride and bridegroom
[1:47:48] and to her was granted that she should
[1:47:51] have right be arrayed in fine linen
[1:47:52] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:47:54] the righteousness of saints and he said
[1:47:56] unto me write blessed are they which are
[1:47:58] called in to the wedding supper of the
[1:48:00] Lamb and he said unto me these are true
[1:48:02] state the true sayings of God
[1:48:04] I fell down his feet to worshiping and
[1:48:06] said see that I do it not I am of thy
[1:48:07] fellow-servant thy brethren and have thy
[1:48:09] brother and have the testimony of Jesus
[1:48:11] worship God for the testimony of Christ
[1:48:13] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and I
[1:48:16] saw heaven open and a white horse oh my
[1:48:18] he that sat there almost called faithful
[1:48:20] and true and righteous and this does he
[1:48:22] judge and make war and his eyes worst
[1:48:24] lanes of fires ahead within many crowns
[1:48:26] he was crowned white king of kings
[1:48:28] and he had written not had her name that
[1:48:31] no-one knowed but himself and he was
[1:48:34] clothed with white best your dipped in
[1:48:35] blood and his name was called the Word
[1:48:37] of God brother Branham says in the
[1:48:39] beginning was word words we got into
[1:48:40] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:48:42] who is it Jesus and his name is called
[1:48:44] the Word of God and the armies which
[1:48:46] we're in heaven followed him upon white
[1:48:47] horses clothed in fine linen white and
[1:48:50] clean glory here he comes and out of his
[1:48:52] mouth will go a sharp sword that that it
[1:48:54] should smite the nation's shall rule
[1:48:56] them with a rod of iron and he treadeth
[1:48:57] the winepress of the fierceness of the
[1:48:59] wrath of Almighty God he had on his vest
[1:49:01] earnest I name written king of kings and
[1:49:04] Lord of lords what is it here's the
[1:49:06] culmination right here his people had
[1:49:09] just crowned him king of kings and Lord
[1:49:12] of lords
[1:49:12] coming back to his holy temple anointed
[1:49:16] with the presence of God to live and
[1:49:18] reign through the millennium with his
[1:49:21] church amen the appearing with the
[1:49:22] mighty King to take her place at his
[1:49:25] side the new royal anointed temple now
[1:49:30] the six full purpose of revelation 6:1 -
[1:49:33] revelations 19 21 is fulfilled that's
[1:49:39] your Bible so according to the Bible
[1:49:45] there's one week left after the rapture
[1:49:47] to fulfill all these great things that's
[1:49:49] going to happen I don't really care what
[1:49:51] no man says the Bible says there's one
[1:49:55] week left after the rapture of the
[1:49:57] church we just proved that
[1:49:58] so whatever else that we think you need
[1:50:01] to take delight what brother said but
[1:50:03] now that becomes trash so what do you do
[1:50:07] with trash throw in the trash can okay
[1:50:09] the trash you thought before throw it in
[1:50:12] the trash can
[1:50:12] alright because there's the whole thing
[1:50:15] that's actually just watch I'll give you
[1:50:20] a key in that standard suite I stand
[1:50:21] there feet here's a whole key when
[1:50:24] brother Branham says and I got the
[1:50:28] quotes ready to bring them but not at
[1:50:30] this time he said seventy weeks that's
[1:50:32] seven years the whole of the 70 weeks
[1:50:34] 490 years is culminated in this one
[1:50:38] week right here all the other is dates
[1:50:40] and times and all the trees and branches
[1:50:42] and all of those stuff but this is where
[1:50:45] actually Israel gets her Redemption and
[1:50:47] the land and they build the temple they
[1:50:49] got to bring what to daniel thy people
[1:50:52] and the holy cities got to be built
[1:50:54] according to ezekiel 40 it can't be
[1:50:56] built right here you got a battle
[1:50:59] Armageddon look on your chart with that
[1:51:01] brother branham drew middle of week
[1:51:04] Armageddon
[1:51:08] just telling you what he said so
[1:51:11] according to the Bible Court of the
[1:51:12] prophets message so now they say no
[1:51:14] brother Brian brother Graham said no no
[1:51:15] no I didn't the last half of the week
[1:51:18] well the first half of the week good no
[1:51:20] you misunderstood what I said when
[1:51:23] brother asked him is seven years after
[1:51:24] the rapture II said no no no nenene I'll
[1:51:26] read the quote but now okay it can't be
[1:51:32] contrary to this
[1:51:33] he can't be this is the Word of God and
[1:51:37] he was a word prophet but now remember
[1:51:41] there was a messiah week that nobody
[1:51:43] realizes that there was three and a half
[1:51:46] years that Jesus preached over here
[1:51:48] there's three and a half years of Jesus
[1:51:50] preached here that's all that's one week
[1:51:54] so Jesus preached the first half of the
[1:51:56] week here he's preaching the last half
[1:51:58] of the week right here but people don't
[1:52:00] understand that they don't listen to
[1:52:02] what brother Graham says because you
[1:52:03] can't go contrary the Bible you cannot
[1:52:06] be a word prophet and be contrary to the
[1:52:10] Bible you can't so he was the word
[1:52:13] prophet I know he was there's no doubt
[1:52:15] he was so any quotes you bring me I'm
[1:52:18] just gonna say let's read revelation
[1:52:19] let's read Daniel 9 let's read let's
[1:52:22] read Daniel 9 and see if it fits your
[1:52:24] revelation or fits your quote but it
[1:52:27] won't because the Bible I got a lot of
[1:52:32] faith in this right here
[1:52:33] I don't like got a lot of faith in man
[1:52:36] that draws their own charts and makes
[1:52:37] their own don't even read this one
[1:52:40] brother he was so confused he read
[1:52:42] scripture that didn't even pertain to
[1:52:43] Daniel seventy weeks but you know what
[1:52:46] when you're a prizefighter or you think
[1:52:48] you're a prize fighter and you're up
[1:52:50] here going hey I got you buddy

[1:52:59] hits him in the head what happens it
[1:53:01] makes him mad so what does he do
[1:53:03] that's what a real good fighter will do
[1:53:05] he'll get you mad right and you'll lose
[1:53:08] your composure you'll start flailing and
[1:53:10] all this and all he's gonna do is go and
[1:53:12] every time you start doing this he's
[1:53:14] gonna go poop that's the way God is with
[1:53:17] the devil he's got the devil some mad
[1:53:19] the devil start swinging everywhere and

[1:53:29] and Satan's gonna be doing all this

[1:54:23] dance okay
[1:54:26] take them put them on somebody else too
[1:54:35] tell you what folks daddy had one of
[1:54:40] these in his pocket about 15 years ago
[1:54:44] and we were over in South Carolina
[1:54:46] hunting the guy walks up to us a real
[1:54:49] good friend of ours and he said I won't
[1:54:52] see you guys in November noticed he was
[1:54:55] pale kind of sickly looking he just went
[1:54:59] to the doctor and he had thought in his
[1:55:01] groin he had thought that he had what he
[1:55:05] call it where you tear you have a
[1:55:07] rupture or something hernia thank you he
[1:55:11] thought he had a hernia down in his
[1:55:12] groin area because they was bunk
[1:55:14] sticking out he had so much cancer in
[1:55:17] his prostate they give him three months
[1:55:19] to live three months University of
[1:55:22] Columbia over in South Carolina that
[1:55:24] hospital is where he went
[1:55:25] actually he worked over there went to
[1:55:27] the hospital they told him so you got
[1:55:29] three months to live go enjoy yourself
[1:55:31] we're not going to give you any chemo
[1:55:32] it's all OB so he said this was in
[1:55:38] February or March and he said I won't be
[1:55:41] able to see you in November he said I
[1:55:45] just want to tell you Bob and joy we and
[1:55:48] daddy said what what's wrong what's the
[1:55:49] problem he said well he said they've
[1:55:51] diagnosed me with cancer instead of
[1:55:55] giving me three months to live it it's
[1:55:57] all over me yeah it became a lot but he
[1:56:04] believed that but you know what daddy
[1:56:05] did he pulled the prayer cloths out of
[1:56:07] his pocket and I mean that thing to be
[1:56:09] real honest with you it was all dirty
[1:56:10] and been in there for years there
[1:56:12] probably but that really doesn't matter
[1:56:14] that really doesn't make any difference
[1:56:16] because he took that prayer cloth and he
[1:56:19] handed it to he handed it to Terry and
[1:56:23] he said I'll see you it he closed his
[1:56:29] hand he put it in his pocket he lived
[1:56:33] nine years nine years from a prayer
[1:56:38] cloth and every time we'd go hunting
[1:56:40] every time he'd go hunting he'd take
[1:56:43] that thing he go still got it still got
[1:56:45] it right here
[1:56:46] you've got it it's right here still got
[1:56:48] it so I don't have to pray for that you
[1:56:51] just don't see what's went on nine years
[1:56:53] the guy was he said they don't
[1:56:56] understand what happened he said they're
[1:56:58] trying to give me some kind of steroid
[1:57:00] to keep me he said keep me what he said
[1:57:03] I'm healed thank God he went to Alaska
[1:57:06] three years after that and went on a
[1:57:08] like a $10,000
[1:57:12] what was it Richard a ram or some kind
[1:57:14] of RAM he had to like climb 12,000 feet
[1:57:17] I mean this guy was in good shape
[1:57:19] to have so much cancer he was in real
[1:57:21] good shape but he did die nine years
[1:57:24] later but you know what he tells you
[1:57:27] every time every he said I told them at
[1:57:29] the University of Columbia over in South
[1:57:31] Carolina he said I want to stay stood
[1:57:34] you the files over there if anybody
[1:57:36] wants to go see it he said I'll tell you
[1:57:38] where it's at he said he said it they
[1:57:40] don't know and kind of explained what
[1:57:42] happened he said but when he went back
[1:57:45] to have another checkup or went back
[1:57:47] again you know and the doctor I guess
[1:57:50] was looking at him like what are you
[1:57:51] doing here you only got three months to
[1:57:53] live checked him in there was zero zero
[1:57:58] cancer where a man was going to die in
[1:58:00] three months just by a man handed him a
[1:58:02] prayer cloth and telling him about it
[1:58:05] and saying what we we believe that's
[1:58:07] what the Bible says in written in acts
[1:58:10] 19 that they took the cloths off of Paul
[1:58:12] he said we believe this that we prayed
[1:58:15] over this prayer cloth and there's an
[1:58:16] anointing that goes on it and you can't
[1:58:19] wash it off no matter how much you wash
[1:58:22] it you can't wash it off but there was
[1:58:24] another anointing and there was a what
[1:58:26] there was a passage to get that to the
[1:58:29] guy it wasn't a tape recorder
[1:58:31] it was a person God is in people God can
[1:58:38] use all these facilities but God is in
[1:58:40] people and that connection he believed
[1:58:43] now this guy's not a believer he's not
[1:58:46] he wasn't even a Christian at the time I
[1:58:48] think he came on a little bit later and
[1:58:50] I reckon he kind of you know figured
[1:58:52] he'd better believe something but he was
[1:58:55] just a sinner him God but he always
[1:58:56] treated us very well very well never
[1:58:58] shunned
[1:58:59] Ritchie you hunted with
[1:59:00] didn't you something Terry yeah Malthus
[1:59:03] and his brothers still probably hunting
[1:59:05] over there but yeah he's just nine years
[1:59:07] the men left lived a good full of nine
[1:59:11] more years and then he finally passed
[1:59:13] away but you know what he links
[1:59:16] temporary the healing of the souls not
[1:59:19] though
[1:59:19] healing of the soul is eternal so when
[1:59:22] we hand you these prayer cloths you
[1:59:24] believe that that's gonna happen that it
[1:59:26] will happen to you just like it did to a
[1:59:28] man that wouldn't even believe it listen
[1:59:30] Donny walked brother Donny walked up
[1:59:32] here with belief all around him can't
[1:59:36] not believe he's seen it happen but what
[1:59:40] about a man that just was dying had no
[1:59:44] hope I believe if we took a picture of
[1:59:47] him he'd have that hood of death over
[1:59:48] him just like that woman in a picture
[1:59:50] brother branham that pronounced the
[1:59:52] woman had cancer remember and then
[1:59:54] because he was three months that demon
[1:59:56] had eat him up he went on he was real
[2:00:00] silent during the whole hunt he didn't
[2:00:01] say anything really cuz you know what
[2:00:03] God was doing something cuz I'm telling
[2:00:05] you the next time he went to the doctor
[2:00:07] that all was gone they said well we're
[2:00:10] gonna go ahead and give you some
[2:00:10] steroids just in case that you know what
[2:00:13] man will do they're gonna give you
[2:00:14] something but you just believe for that
[2:00:17] you take that with you to tonight this
[2:00:19] afternoon and you believe what God's
[2:00:21] already done you believe what God has
[2:00:23] already done in the Bible you believe
[2:00:25] what he's going to do cuz listen we
[2:00:29] always have to believe for the
[2:00:30] impossible hey why why do we need to
[2:00:32] believe that we're gonna get in the car
[2:00:33] and go home I mean we're just gonna walk
[2:00:35] out there and turn the key but we got to
[2:00:38] believe for the impossible we got to
[2:00:39] believe for a body change and you know
[2:00:41] what that's potential that's potential
[2:00:44] body change when you're healed that's
[2:00:45] the potential but what's gonna happen
[2:00:46] one - brother Karn it's gonna steamroll
[2:00:50] it's gonna not stop it's not good we're
[2:00:54] gonna well I'm healed but oh I feel sick

[2:01:27] had this he had problems with sugar
[2:01:29] diabetes very bad diabetic but something

[2:01:35] and and he was just bedridden and so his
[2:01:40] son and some other some of the other
[2:01:42] ones that help helped him out in the
[2:01:43] church they were the ones who were
[2:01:45] taking the services and they were just
[2:01:46] praying for their pastor just bring for
[2:01:48] the pastor we went when we went during
[2:01:50] December I went back there to see him he
[2:01:52] would always still go to the services
[2:01:54] but he would have to lay in a bed the
[2:01:57] pastor of the church laying in the bed
[2:01:58] on the at the back of the church trying
[2:02:01] to listen in and he couldn't talk he
[2:02:03] could I mean he was just with his eyes

[2:02:12] name is brother at Nestor I said brother
[2:02:13] Ernesto can you hear me and he said he
[2:02:16] would acknowledge and he and so I gave
[2:02:18] him a prayer cloth and we played
[2:02:19] together the exact same prayer cloths

[2:02:31] that they know him he's a vet he's well
[2:02:33] famous well-known pastor there and he he
[2:02:37] took video of his dad and his dad was
[2:02:40] sit sitting up and he's talking to the
[2:02:42] camera and he's saying like I appreciate
[2:02:45] everyone's prayers
[2:02:46] I mean it's but he's been sick for a
[2:02:47] long time he said I appreciate
[2:02:50] everyone's prayers and I appreciate it
[2:02:52] and so he said I believe the Lord's
[2:02:54] gonna raise me back up put me back in my
[2:02:56] post of duty and so I you know I believe
[2:03:00] it's all this the prayers of the Saints
[2:03:02] but hey I gave him a prayer cloth and
[2:03:03] maybe that anointing just just sits
[2:03:05] there right there and maybe you've ever
[2:03:07] changed things I don't know god man
[2:03:10] God's in control and then
[2:03:12] and we think God's not doing anything
[2:03:15] we're just so dry we just kind of just
[2:03:17] teach for an hour and a half or two
[2:03:19] hours and we go home and ain't nothing
[2:03:22] going on come on people
[2:03:25] brother branham told us he said the same
[2:03:30] anointing that that fourth church age
[2:03:32] had where they went into the lion's den
[2:03:35] he said that same anointing is on you
[2:03:38] just to make it through your daily your
[2:03:40] daily duties in other words paraphrasing
[2:03:42] that same anointing that kept that took
[2:03:45] them to let lines down and kept that
[2:03:47] anointing on them to be that fourth age
[2:03:49] it's the same anointing that you got on
[2:03:51] you to make it through your daily duties
[2:03:53] it's an overcoming just to get here so
