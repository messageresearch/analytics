[36:49] Anna and sister Nala got up to sing and
[36:52] they set the place on fire
[36:54] so everything was going pretty good and
[36:57] all at once said this started like an
[36:59] old Pentecostal meeting there was a lot
[37:01] of shouting going home and dancing
[37:03] around and everything and you know we
[37:06] was always doing pretty good but you
[37:10] know we just had a good time doing it in
[37:13] the Lord and you'd never guess who was
[37:18] the last one died since you never guess
[37:21] they had to him just kind of got and you
[37:28] know all dinner sailed and had a good
[37:29] time fellowship in our Amen all right
[37:32] now we're talking about the stature of a
[37:35] perfect man trying to understand what is
[37:40] expected of us in this generation or
[37:45] date all right now we're not concerned
[37:48] with what other ages are we're concerned
[37:51] with this age so that's what I want you
[37:54] to think on is that to me I you know you
[38:00] can say well this age is this and this
[38:01] age is that I want I'm wanting us to
[38:04] talk about the alive word that is in the
[38:08] age that we're in now the you know the
[38:12] alive word right now what was paisa
[38:14] spice what future is future with the
[38:18] prophet said that was our biggest
[38:19] mistake that we made we either go
[38:22] backward or we go forward and we feel
[38:24] failed to see what's taking place right
[38:27] now what others don't see much going on
[38:31] well then you know what's wrong you you
[38:37] so we're just dead apart Luther that
[38:39] means you're dead you know because you
[38:42] you ain't gonna say they're dead up
[38:44] there are you you're gonna say we did
[38:47] you're gonna say it like we did but what
[38:50] you mean is everybody's dead but me and
[38:53] I'm trying to tell you how dead all
[38:54] y'all are but just remember the word
[38:58] Wiis means we okay but now talking about
[39:03] the statue of a perfect man because to
[39:05] me that is one of the most gracious
[39:11] wonderful what else could you call it to
[39:16] have an experience to be able to
[39:20] understand the Bible and to walk in the
[39:23] light of the hour that we're living and
[39:25] to see the Prophet came to bring us
[39:28] these things and to bring into
[39:31] manifestation in our hearts and lives
[39:34] and we'll read in a minute
[39:37] these are the things the Prophet said
[39:40] God expects us to add well see then if
[39:47] he expects us I remember Richards when
[39:49] he came down from Tennessee years ago
[39:51] and and you know he said I was in this
[39:55] series or top in it and he said oh well
[39:58] I didn't know this these things was
[40:00] expected of us well what do you think it
[40:04] sitting that far I mean if it ain't
[40:06] expect to tear it out man telling me one
[40:09] time that to give sometimes order but
[40:11] you still got to give me a Bible you
[40:13] know I mean I just ripped it out of it
[40:16] you know because if it's not there what
[40:20] do we need it for you know it's this
[40:23] space you know but I see in this day
[40:26] that the biggest thing that we all we
[40:29] all be us me too
[40:31] is that we're not thinking about what's
[40:35] taking place we're looking back and
[40:39] we're looking forward we're not
[40:41] following what's taking place well when
[40:44] are we going to get to that position to
[40:47] think on these things all right now the
[40:50] Prophet said it was I said we'll read it
[40:51] a minute he said these are the things
[40:53] that God expects us go ahead
[40:59] well I can't do nothing well you know
[41:03] maybe we need to listen because I think
[41:06] we've had long enough to play around of
[41:10] 50 years since we're leaving of the
[41:12] profit right I think it's time to be
[41:16] serious about where we're at and what
[41:19] we're doing because things are getting
[41:22] bad everywhere else and you know so then
[41:25] let's let's consider that all right but
[41:27] now think about it our last message we
[41:32] were talking about the one thing that I
[41:34] believe holds a great key is to wear
[41:37] that it is a reading there in the
[41:39] scripture in verse 5 it says add to your
[41:42] faith now it doesn't say add faith this
[41:49] says add to your faith then it says add
[41:53] virtue all right now what was the
[41:58] emphasis faith is not a virtue in that
[42:03] respect it is a gift
[42:08] Ardi gift it is the baptism of the Holy
[42:11] Ghost the Prophet said have faith and be
[42:15] born again he said these are the things
[42:17] that you know that God expects of us
[42:20] first he said how faith and be born
[42:22] again all right see then faith is not a
[42:26] virtue or something it is not even added
[42:34] he added he gave us his life all right
[42:40] he gave us eternal life that's the faith
[42:45] that it's talking about all right and
[42:47] that faith then becomes a part of us
[42:50] it's a part of his life given to us to
[42:53] make us sons and daughters of a living
[42:55] God all right
[42:57] see then it becomes my faith because he
[43:00] gave it to me right he gave us the new
[43:06] birth then we ought to rejoice about
[43:08] what he has given us
[43:10] all right but then think about it see
[43:13] it's not a faith it's not an ad it's a
[43:16] foundation the Prophet covered we gave
[43:19] it over and over and over where he says
[43:21] the foundation of all Christianity is
[43:25] based upon faith in the Word of God all
[43:30] right so then you'd say well what's it
[43:33] all over there all right upon this rock
[43:36] I'll build my church and the gates of
[43:38] Hell shall not prevail against it so
[43:40] then the church is build up on faith
[43:44] faith you know well then get faith and
[43:50] really in what it is it is the new birth
[43:53] how faith and be born again it's the new
[43:56] birth well I don't understand what you
[44:00] mean by that
[44:00] I tried to emphasize it real good to
[44:03] life service they're talking about that
[44:07] we we look at faith as being some
[44:11] something that we can attain see we put
[44:15] something way up head when we look at
[44:17] the pyramid you know and we say well I
[44:19] don't know I may be done in here now but
[44:22] I just don't see I'm up in here these
[44:24] well it may be true but it's there for
[44:29] us all right
[44:31] and the Prophet said these are the
[44:34] things that God these are the things
[44:37] that God that he expects you to add so
[44:44] well I can't add nothing no but we can
[44:48] make ourselves available Christianity is
[44:53] not something you can work up in or do
[44:56] but you have to make yourself available
[45:01] that's the main point if we won't do
[45:04] that then God can't help us anyway all
[45:08] right
[45:08] make ourself available make yourself
[45:10] open study the word the read the Bible
[45:16] and do it brother was preaching - not on
[45:19] the you know about the cell phones and
[45:22] how to do it
[45:23] and I marked down a little thing on mine
[45:26] because he he says that there's they're
[45:29] medically saying now that there's a
[45:31] little knot on the back of the head of
[45:33] people that's coming up right here on
[45:36] the back you know why cellphone people
[45:45] are doing down so much to do now this is
[45:48] serious he wasn't kidding he was given
[45:51] the medical thing and I'm you know I
[45:54] didn't realize maybe I missed the point
[45:56] but he said it was like 78 percent of
[45:58] the American people her cell phone
[46:00] I believe that's about what he was just
[46:02] saying I don't number and let me give
[46:05] her numbers like 300,000 Americans you
[46:07] know out of that 250,000 or more
[46:09] he's got cell phones see and that's you
[46:14] know that was his point to express what
[46:17] we're doing and he said that they've
[46:19] medically said people are bending over
[46:21] you know you've had so much throw you
[46:22] seen it with with computers with women
[46:26] typist and things that have problems
[46:28] because they're bent over and everything
[46:30] well he said they've been well that's
[46:33] doing pretty good and so what's taking
[46:36] over
[46:38] what's taking over in Our Lives taking
[46:49] over what we have young yeah we have
[46:53] phones are good they got a reason the
[46:55] purpose for being here and they're good
[46:58] you know that's fine but now when you
[47:02] you can't even curl in a conversation
[47:03] because of people you know green or
[47:05] anything and in that don't don't think
[47:09] you're fooling me I know a lot of you're
[47:11] sitting there now looking over
[47:15] oh you got the phone hidden then you're
[47:21] sitting there ok then we expect the
[47:30] Statue of a perfect man to be building
[47:31] us if we were studying my point if we
[47:35] were studying the message like we have
[47:38] everything else I think it would help us
[47:41] don't you
[47:42] I mean ain't that serious enough that if
[47:45] we were putting our hearts and our minds
[47:47] to studying the message and letting our
[47:50] children study it from that the brothers
[47:54] was talking about a three-year-old with
[47:56] a cell phone you know I mean you got
[47:58] kids now they you know I mean Lily Lily
[48:02] do better on the cell phone and I can
[48:05] she's overtired a little finger going
[48:07] and getting these things and she'll pick
[48:08] up the essence here that's good no you
[48:15] can't so I used mine for what it's to be
[48:17] huge folks okay not telling you to throw
[48:21] it in a trash can mine got throwed in
[48:23] the light but you know listen church my
[48:28] whole point is what is the thoughts in
[48:32] our mind of the day and the hour that
[48:35] we're living should it not be that our
[48:41] whole thoughts should be based upon
[48:45] Christianity our goal should be to know
[48:51] the Word of God to study the Word of God
[48:56] right that should be our whole goal
[48:58] because that now we'll get to that in a
[49:00] minute because you asked me said well
[49:01] how do you get these virtues it's gonna
[49:03] have to come from the word all right so
[49:07] we'll get to that point in a minute but
[49:08] what I want you to think about now hold
[49:10] that point have faith and be born again
[49:15] all right
[49:16] then these are the things that God
[49:18] expects us to add well it's expected you
[49:24] say yeah but I can't add it but you can
[49:26] make yourself available
[49:29] the Word of God no just like I said I
[49:34] don't wanna raise the hands but how
[49:36] many's read statue a perfect man since I
[49:39] asked you to read it or listen to the
[49:42] tape well my kids they just don't do
[49:46] they don't pop that really Angelica
[49:52] sadhana learn listen to the tape a
[49:54] little it'll change things okay but now
[50:00] listen faith is not a virtue it is the
[50:07] foundation that everything is based on
[50:14] upon this rock I'll build my church it's
[50:19] built upon the revelation of the word of
[50:23] God
[50:23] what was the Prophet to do I thought
[50:29] that the purpose of the sending of the
[50:32] Prophet was for us to receive the word
[50:36] back in the original form that it was in
[50:41] the book of Acts and the things you know
[50:44] or the writing of the Bible and thing
[50:46] the face of the father's which you don't
[50:49] hear anything about the face of the
[50:50] father's no no not will be on dad
[50:55] well how'd you get that question oh
[50:59] we're way up here how did you get well
[51:03] you know I'm up here too I'm up here to
[51:05] top with your love how did you get that
[51:08] well I got love filling our gospel make
[51:15] it yours which one you think you got all
[51:18] right but think about what we're saying
[51:19] now a house is held up by the foundation
[51:27] right
[51:28] it is not suspended out in mid are held
[51:32] up by skyhook you ever heard those
[51:35] statements you know what a people you
[51:37] know we used to say it and they say well
[51:38] how that this puts you a skyhook out
[51:40] there you know just hang it up the sky
[51:42] well now you you know I didn't got much
[51:45] sense to think that that would work
[51:47] because it won't hold it up all right
[51:50] but now see the foundation of all
[51:53] Christianity is based upon the
[51:57] Revelation faith because faith is a
[52:02] revelation right all of Christianity is
[52:06] based upon the revelation of God's Word
[52:09] we have we know more about all the other
[52:12] things and we know about God's Word
[52:15] right you know we read everything else
[52:20] but we don't know you can tell how much
[52:22] this is and how much that is and what
[52:24] percentage is isn't what that is and all
[52:26] the things all the different things
[52:28] you've got and you say well what about
[52:32] this in the Bible well we're beyond that
[52:35] well I love asking question how'd you
[52:39] get that I mean if you have reached I'm
[52:43] serious now women come on everybody in
[52:46] the building I'm serious if you know how
[52:50] to get to I've been toasted well people
[52:53] at Lulla don't believe like I believe I
[52:55] believe this not but everybody don't
[52:58] believe like I believe will let may be
[52:59] true but is it true or what but I'm open
[53:03] I'm open and I pay you okay women men
[53:09] and all we we don't believe in women
[53:10] preachers but we're gonna make an
[53:13] exception if you know how to get to the
[53:16] Statue of a perfect man all right
[53:23] wayde's off this afternoon he's supposed
[53:26] to be preaching but he just got took out
[53:29] of the way for you now if you know how
[53:32] to I don't think I mean it seriously if
[53:36] you know how to get to the Statue of
[53:38] perfect man
[53:38] we need for you to pre preach to us or
[53:41] teach to us and we'll make an exception
[53:43] we let you women stand out front and you
[53:45] can tell us all about how to get there
[53:47] cuz I want to get to there if these are
[53:50] the things God expects
[53:55] right yes / - don't want Ellucian to me
[53:59] you don't want to listen good you don't
[54:01] have nothing I'm not afraid I'm not
[54:06] afraid about what I believe and what I
[54:07] say and I'm not scared to say it and to
[54:11] tell you like it is because that's where
[54:13] I stand
[54:14] all right but now listen if the card
[54:19] expects us to add these things then
[54:26] there's one thing for certain if he
[54:28] expects it he has already made away
[54:34] right for us to receive it or he
[54:37] wouldn't expect it so he sent to profit
[54:42] right well we need to know about this we
[54:47] know when I ain't got time to read the
[54:49] prophets message you know he sent a
[54:53] prophet in vain if he's not willing to
[54:56] back up what he said and waiting to back
[55:00] it up so whose problem has it been for
[55:03] 50 years us and that us means starting
[55:07] me here through you all right because we
[55:13] know everything else but we don't know
[55:14] about the DES message all right now
[55:17] listen add to your foundation okay you
[55:25] build a house search for the Tony
[55:27] different ones that are our carpenters
[55:29] you know most of us are a little bit in
[55:32] that line of mine and we know as I said
[55:34] we don't hang them out on the sky hook
[55:37] we build a foundation but make your
[55:41] foundation the Bible says sure all right
[55:45] now you're gonna build a 10 story
[55:48] building then you go out there and you
[55:52] just clear it off and you just start
[55:54] letting your blocks know I won't do in a
[56:00] house let alone 10 story building
[56:02] you know something gonna cave in and
[56:04] hurry right you got to get that foot and
[56:07] right that foundation alright and I'm
[56:12] like this I'm bigger is better I guess
[56:15] you call it if to me you're gonna pour
[56:18] six inches of concrete will one up or
[56:20] eight inches what are the purposes and
[56:26] then they're only required we talk about
[56:28] requirements of what the law of what
[56:30] this land says or whatever I'm talking
[56:33] about Christianity if we're gonna work
[56:36] for 10% why not work for a hundred
[56:38] percent in Christianity because you're
[56:43] going to see in a minute when we get
[56:44] down to the point of thinking about it
[56:46] because there's some words brother
[56:48] branham used that has to be brought and
[56:51] I was gonna bring some of that today but
[56:54] I'm laying the background for it
[56:56] the I know the prophet will make a
[56:59] statement but you've got to place that
[57:03] statement in the correct order now like
[57:07] he says about virtue for instance he
[57:10] said now that doesn't mean live a virgin
[57:11] life well is it okay not to live I mean
[57:14] it is he meaning it's okay to not live a
[57:18] virgin life
[57:19] no he's meaning that's supposed to be
[57:21] settled in your faith right it's not a
[57:27] question of whether or not you're
[57:28] supposed to live a virgin life that's
[57:31] not a question that's not a thought
[57:34] there's gonna be a Christian you're
[57:38] supposed to be a Christian well I don't
[57:43] know where whether I should cut my hair
[57:45] or where I should do this or what you
[57:47] know I don't know if I do they're gonna
[57:49] if I don't they're gonna know like I
[57:53] said we talk about things that brother
[57:57] branham brought when he did not to bring
[57:59] them the Bible already said it the Bible
[58:07] already told you not to cut you her not
[58:09] to punch your face the Bible says that
[58:12] when are we going to just read it
[58:16] you realize what you're doing you
[58:20] realize by not accepting what the Word
[58:22] of God says now God had to send a
[58:26] prophet are you with me because the
[58:31] people wouldn't do it so he sent the
[58:32] Prophet to do it yeah why did he send a
[58:36] prophet to America oh we have what we're
[58:38] good
[58:39] well I've heard this one that knew God
[58:41] God sent it to America we got the money
[58:43] to send it to the world boy your corner
[58:47] what kind of a spirituality do you think
[58:50] that is think of some little bitty
[58:54] things that you make us I'm not throwing
[58:56] off on him this little straight it's 150
[58:59] something miles long about 50 miles wide
[59:02] god what a couple of mile forgot how
[59:04] many million people 1 million people God
[59:10] could send this message or this Bible or
[59:14] this things to them the world from
[59:16] Jamaica Buddha book no no no he said to
[59:22] America called he sent it to America
[59:24] because we're the ones that are the
[59:26] worst why did the Prophet come he don't
[59:29] come because of money he don't need
[59:31] money he come because this land was the
[59:36] worst garbage can that there is in the
[59:38] world this America that we call right
[59:46] because we think we're so spiritual you
[59:54] know that a prophet is a condemnation to
[59:56] a nation
[59:57] you don't read them do you know it's
[1:00:02] central night it's got a compound
[1:00:04] meaning it's sent to the nation to save
[1:00:08] it yes but to condemn it also what's
[1:00:14] that I'm just playing a point for you to
[1:00:17] think about because we take something
[1:00:21] and we'll read it and we use it instead
[1:00:24] of understanding and letting it
[1:00:27] enhance us we use it for corrective
[1:00:30] forms but I know what that that's just
[1:00:36] my mind huh we use it to correct with
[1:00:41] instead of using it to develop from you
[1:00:48] say something about virtue well brother
[1:00:50] Brennan said that's not living a virgin
[1:00:52] life
[1:00:52] what is it okay to live like the devil
[1:00:54] is that what you're saying are you
[1:00:57] saying that he's saying it's okay to go
[1:01:00] ahead and do these other cuz this over
[1:01:02] here is not what its meaning
[1:01:03] he's just illustrating the one natural
[1:01:06] thing because that virtue I'll get this
[1:01:14] part in and I'll back up to the next
[1:01:15] service if you ever looked at will see
[1:01:18] what virtue means and we've ever just
[1:01:24] looked up see what virtue means
[1:01:29] according Webster virtue is moral
[1:01:33] excellence goodness righteousness
[1:01:48] conformity in life and conduct to morale
[1:01:55] and never how you say ethical I'm very
[1:01:58] pronounced that word principles a good
[1:02:06] or admire ability that's lack of a
[1:02:10] person another thing or whatever one
[1:02:15] right I brought it down to avert you
[1:02:17] mean strength now did that woman draw
[1:02:23] virtue from Jesus did she look at
[1:02:25] himself when we look at muscles man I
[1:02:29] bet he could pick up 200-pound strength
[1:02:33] well we've got a good spiritual thing
[1:02:36] going today at Lee we didn't know it
[1:02:38] meant like that what about that he just
[1:02:41] means strength the life that Jesus lived
[1:02:48] before that woman was where she got that
[1:02:56] strength from to believe we'll get back
[1:02:59] to those things I just want you to think
[1:03:01] on it because what I want you to think
[1:03:03] on is we we take something of what we
[1:03:06] want it to be we make it two things we
[1:03:08] want it to be and then somebody said
[1:03:12] something quick as I say it we just what
[1:03:15] we click well he don't know what he's on
[1:03:17] that virtue
[1:03:18] hurts your strength we don't we don't
[1:03:20] worry that setting the book you know you
[1:03:24] don't need to be in the book you need to
[1:03:27] be in the hearts and lives of the people
[1:03:29] a living Bible instead of the letters on
[1:03:35] page she is taking up on us and watch
[1:03:45] the definition we'll get back to that
[1:03:47] definition later and we'll cover it on
[1:03:48] because it's not to just say well it's
[1:03:51] not a virgin
[1:03:52] well the Prophet said it's okay do all
[1:03:53] these it he didn't say that he was
[1:03:58] emphasizing
[1:04:00] the way that the word is used in that
[1:04:02] definition at that point right so we'll
[1:04:06] get back to those sign but see look it's
[1:04:09] supposed to be taking upon ourselves the
[1:04:11] divine nature of God now there is the
[1:04:17] only strength or our virtue that is
[1:04:19] worth anything is the divine nature of
[1:04:22] Almighty God nature our virtue the
[1:04:30] divine nature our divine nature and you
[1:04:32] know virtue the things of God
[1:04:35] he expects us to add these things but we
[1:04:48] can't do it ain't nobody said anything
[1:04:51] about what we can do and don't do but if
[1:04:56] we won't make ourself available he can't
[1:05:00] do it he can't save you if you don't
[1:05:04] want to be saved
[1:05:06] well no he can boy he dr. Paul no don't
[1:05:11] go those routes he can't save you if you
[1:05:15] don't want to be saved
[1:05:16] the probably said he can't override your
[1:05:19] free moral agency all right no she
[1:05:24] expects us to have these virtues so it
[1:05:28] must be that he has provided away and he
[1:05:35] did which is the prophets message right
[1:05:40] the Word of God so that others can see
[1:05:49] his nature in us that's what the
[1:05:54] strength from virtual you'll find to be
[1:05:57] more and more is that you can look at
[1:06:00] something or somebody he said how would
[1:06:01] it be if you're out here telling
[1:06:03] somebody that you're a Christian he said
[1:06:05] in drunk the next day he said ain't no
[1:06:07] virtue to that this
[1:06:13] it's for taking of his divine nature but
[1:06:15] letting that nature live to outwardly
[1:06:17] into our hearts and lives
[1:06:21] see it's his nature the probably said to
[1:06:25] be like Jesus was the greatest song he'd
[1:06:28] ever heard well what was he wanting to
[1:06:31] be like Jesus oh he went out and raised
[1:06:32] it at healed assigment is that all you
[1:06:35] can see of the life of Jesus yup and he
[1:06:44] was God he was tempted in more than you
[1:06:46] and I could ever think about being
[1:06:48] tempted so don't set him aside and try
[1:06:51] to make it to be something that that he
[1:06:53] wasn't empty no he was tempted worse
[1:06:54] than we are that's what we should
[1:06:57] consider did not listen
[1:07:02] so do you see what I'm talking and
[1:07:04] driving add to your faith what God gave
[1:07:13] you the new birth right all right he
[1:07:20] gave it to you it belongs to you okay he
[1:07:25] ain't gonna take it back right he's not
[1:07:29] an Indian giver so he's not gonna take
[1:07:31] that back from them it belongs to you
[1:07:34] then if he says now add virtue strengths
[1:07:38] and you know know whatever willing to
[1:07:39] make them he's got to make away and he
[1:07:45] did by giving us the word what you see
[1:07:57] instead of us trying to to take it and
[1:07:59] study of the things that said we're
[1:08:02] trying to make it something that it's
[1:08:03] not see the new birth is the nature of
[1:08:13] Almighty God which I believe it is we
[1:08:18] have always tried to teach it to you
[1:08:19] because that's what I believe it I
[1:08:22] believe the new birth is the birth of
[1:08:24] the word
[1:08:28] now if you can express anything else
[1:08:30] that's an uber to be then the birth of
[1:08:33] the word I'd like to know about it and
[1:08:36] I'll give you the full pitch you can
[1:08:37] have it to explain it what you see the
[1:08:43] birth of the word is to bring the very
[1:08:46] nature remember what Jesus said to
[1:08:48] Nicodemus he said you must be born again
[1:08:52] the original says you must be born from
[1:08:54] above in other words Jesus was telling
[1:08:58] Nicodemus if you could ever come to the
[1:09:00] place to be born from where I come from
[1:09:02] then you will know what I'm talking
[1:09:04] about right the new birth see we are
[1:09:13] supposed to be partakers of his divine
[1:09:15] nature which is the partakers of the
[1:09:21] word right see I can't do anything
[1:09:29] myself but I can accept what he's done
[1:09:34] for me and then I can try to make myself
[1:09:38] available it's not go out and live like
[1:09:45] the devil and then said well I'm a
[1:09:46] Christian we were talking about that
[1:09:51] coming home last night kind of you know
[1:09:53] in our thoughts a lot of times we we we
[1:09:59] get it all messed up now listen if the
[1:10:04] new birth is the birth of the word the
[1:10:08] word revealed to you are made alive the
[1:10:12] disciples took the word they held the
[1:10:15] word the Holy Ghost came and quickened
[1:10:18] the word giving them the new birth right
[1:10:23] that's the same thing that happens to
[1:10:25] you and I we study the Word of God we
[1:10:29] hear the preaching we do and God comes
[1:10:32] to us accepting our believing because
[1:10:38] we've accepted
[1:10:39] him then he comes and accepts our
[1:10:41] believing of him and gives us his own
[1:10:45] very nature faith you don't give you
[1:10:50] something that it's not worth anything
[1:10:51] he gives you the very foundation of all
[1:10:54] Christianity his faith in the Word of
[1:10:56] God and then when he gives that to us
[1:11:02] then he's expecting us to add these like
[1:11:06] well how can we add him all right the
[1:11:08] Prophet made it that's read I want you
[1:11:10] to listen to what he's saying he said
[1:11:13] you can't a nice rubber and metal
[1:11:17] you can't do that sorry I can do this
[1:11:22] all right do that cuz I'm Christian I
[1:11:24] know I'm born again they don't bother me
[1:11:27] to drink smoke dude no no I don't bother
[1:11:30] cuz you're not born again who are you
[1:11:32] telling me any born again yeah yeah
[1:11:35] anything else does that answer the
[1:11:39] question
[1:11:40] I didn't stumble when I said it if we
[1:11:43] live like the devil are we do you think
[1:11:50] you live a good Christian life
[1:11:51] no sure don't did you see it ain't up to
[1:11:54] us to live a Christian life it's up to
[1:11:57] us to let him come in to us and let him
[1:12:02] live outwardly that's his divine nature
[1:12:08] that's the Christian life all right
[1:12:14] did the entire pyramid now watch them
[1:12:17] say if the new birth is the foundation
[1:12:20] of the Word of God then the end time
[1:12:26] period would be the birth of the word
[1:12:29] that's sensible code it's the same
[1:12:32] material right now wouldn't it be good
[1:12:40] Tony do we go out boy we pour that
[1:12:42] foundation we put 12 inches well let's
[1:12:44] put 14 let's do this and do that and
[1:12:47] then we go down and buy the cheapest two
[1:12:49] before as we can buy to start from there
[1:12:52] or some kind of a material that ain't
[1:12:55] worth nothing and then we start building
[1:12:57] a house know whatever we put on the
[1:13:06] second stage to lay on the foundation
[1:13:08] should be as strong well you know it's
[1:13:13] supposed to be 16 centers so we'll make
[1:13:14] it 40 inch center that won't matter
[1:13:16] I won't matter a little swag fall down
[1:13:19] it won't matter and that's what we do in
[1:13:22] our Christian life to letting him do it
[1:13:27] how do we add these virtues by the word
[1:13:30] that is revealed to us the Bible says
[1:13:34] study to show that self approve workman
[1:13:36] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[1:13:37] dividing the word of truth see then the
[1:13:46] word that is revealed to us is the way
[1:13:50] God brings to us his nature because the
[1:13:57] new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[1:13:58] Christ right all right what would be the
[1:14:03] rest of the pyramid would be the birth
[1:14:07] of the word that's why I love it anyway
[1:14:10] cause you're birthed into this see your
[1:14:12] birth into this you burst into this
[1:14:14] person this person will have any burst
[1:14:16] we have I don't know but I love it in
[1:14:21] the scripture were during the book of
[1:14:23] Acts they had many feelings of the Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost
[1:14:25] don't you have many feelings every time
[1:14:29] they gathered they had many feelings of
[1:14:32] the Holy Ghost and then a new birth to
[1:14:35] have that one but what does it matter if
[1:14:38] we have many births what's the problem
[1:14:41] so I'm birthing to this person to this
[1:14:44] person the Prophet says no son the
[1:14:48] opening of the word is the is the birth
[1:14:50] why is it then the scripture says being
[1:14:53] born again these are studying of God's
[1:15:00] Word will bring the nature of God
[1:15:04] because he can quicken it but if we
[1:15:07] don't know what the prophets say let's
[1:15:08] see he said the Holy Ghost is sitting in
[1:15:10] your soul waiting on you to bring in the
[1:15:12] word now perforation I'm hitting pretty
[1:15:15] close but he said now as quick as you
[1:15:18] bring it in said he'll make it live
[1:15:20] where's he yet these words he yet he's
[1:15:29] inside your soul that's your faith
[1:15:31] that's your foundation that's where he's
[1:15:33] living at he's waiting on you to bring
[1:15:35] in the word he's waiting on you to study
[1:15:37] the word and and to get to that but it's
[1:15:43] not just had knowledge of how much we
[1:15:45] can read now we'll get to those things
[1:15:49] it's the revealed word he realized then
[1:15:54] the key to the whole thing is what you
[1:15:57] know I said I'd get around to speaking
[1:16:00] on eventually because I did I ask
[1:16:03] brother motor I said now how did we get
[1:16:05] these virtues he said well I don't
[1:16:06] rightly know I said I don't either I
[1:16:09] went throwing off on the my what the
[1:16:11] Lord spoke to me about 19 and 80 and he
[1:16:14] was showing me the the opening of the
[1:16:16] word through the seals and they're
[1:16:18] different things and and he showed me
[1:16:21] the key what is the key to be able to
[1:16:26] add the virtues number one we know we
[1:16:31] can't have him okay solve the problem we
[1:16:35] drew that don't thank Sealy we can't do
[1:16:38] it but he can do it but we got to make
[1:16:41] itself available well I don't need to
[1:16:44] study that seal book probably preach
[1:16:47] didn't it'll be that that for what does
[1:16:48] it matter to me well I thought it was
[1:16:51] the plan of redemption I mean I'm sorry
[1:16:55] that's that's the way I think I thought
[1:16:58] the seals was the plan of redemption
[1:17:00] I thought the seals revealed things
[1:17:02] about Redemption that were not made
[1:17:05] known to mankind until the coming of the
[1:17:09] end time and the Prophet coming to bring
[1:17:12] the word I mean if I've missed that I'm
[1:17:14] sorry that's just where I stands what
[1:17:16] always believed God had it available
[1:17:21] with who could he get to deliver it to
[1:17:24] your name let's see we get hung up in
[1:17:30] the vessel instead of the delivery
[1:17:37] instead of believing the word that has
[1:17:40] been brought that it will take care of
[1:17:43] our needs we get hung up on the vessel
[1:17:47] that was brought by and stopped with a
[1:17:49] hat well you know I mean if that's
[1:17:54] offensive to anybody I'm sorry but is it
[1:17:57] true so how do you get anything
[1:18:07] all right now Josh where's the enemy he
[1:18:15] doesn't disappear by courage and turned
[1:18:16] into then he groped hard on anything now
[1:18:24] anybody run the ball then brother Bob
[1:18:27] he's a he's on some way in the computer
[1:18:29] tech that's what I tell him around here

[1:18:33] now I don't know what that means
[1:18:34] I just heard that word that's he call
[1:18:38] him computer techs they supposed to know
[1:18:41] something about a computer huh no no

[1:20:53] lesson this afternoon and imaginary
[1:20:55] numbers I don't need no lesson to
[1:20:57] imagine their numbers

[1:21:01] need no imaginary and I'm not making a
[1:21:03] joke I'm just making illustration how do

[1:21:27] that far well we need somebody you know
[1:21:30] I mean they pay them outstanding amounts
[1:21:35] of money today for people to know
[1:21:41] how's it taking those numbers and put it
[1:21:43] together come out with right answer
[1:21:45] right well what about in the Christian
[1:21:50] room now how can we get Donnie he's a
[1:21:58] mechanic
[1:21:59] well now Donnie's going to explain to
[1:22:02] Bob on mechanic and Bob's gonna tell us
[1:22:06] all about it with a computer well we
[1:22:12] just get all messed up right what is the
[1:22:16] way it's to study it study it to be able
[1:22:27] to say and you know ain't it so amazing
[1:22:30] and I look at it like this and thinking
[1:22:33] about the human mind and how smart we
[1:22:35] think we are but you know what Bob
[1:22:38] cannot doing anything in the computer
[1:22:41] room unless he's knows one plus one
[1:22:44] equals two
[1:22:49] Donnie can't fix a car unless he knows
[1:22:51] one plus one equals two they used to
[1:22:56] make so much fun of me cause I was in
[1:22:57] the DOS end of the deal coming up and I
[1:23:00] never did care about the windows you
[1:23:03] know and I was a dass man still do it
[1:23:06] but you know what I didn't know enough
[1:23:08] sense to know one thing you know your
[1:23:10] windows is sitting over my dass my daus
[1:23:14] is still controlling das is the first
[1:23:19] level of mechanical parts you would call
[1:23:22] it of computer ISM I guess would be the
[1:23:24] way to say it you know you can't do away
[1:23:28] with it you can't do away with it
[1:23:36] because it's the way to get there how do
[1:23:40] we get there by prior and studying is
[1:23:43] that the way you profit said do we get
[1:23:45] the Word of God prior and studying
[1:23:50] studying the Word of God studying the
[1:23:53] Bible
[1:23:54] study the prophets message see we've got
[1:24:03] the prophets message the Word of God to
[1:24:07] tell us all things and the Prophet
[1:24:09] wouldn't he say within these books and
[1:24:11] tapes lives the change of the body we'd
[1:24:15] call it justice
[1:24:16] verbatim of words and we're going to
[1:24:22] study Greer's Almanac we're going to
[1:24:25] study this we're gonna study that ain't
[1:24:28] got time to to read ain't got time to
[1:24:31] study the message well you know what
[1:24:37] we're gonna get exactly what we're gonna
[1:24:38] know we're gonna still be with the DOS
[1:24:40] and everybody else gonna be going with
[1:24:42] the windows cause it's the same simple
[1:24:46] thing that's why I told a man let's eat
[1:24:50] that you know brought me into it and
[1:24:52] everything the kids tried to get me into
[1:24:54] the computer point of it this is the
[1:24:56] point but see I was on the das I could
[1:24:58] work it and do what I wanted and the man
[1:25:01] kept home and he laughed at me the one
[1:25:03] that showed me what to do or sold it to
[1:25:05] me he said you still own that I see up
[1:25:07] still on it he says what are you going
[1:25:10] to get out of them back on days I said
[1:25:11] when you put it to her that I could type
[1:25:13] in God is good and it immediately
[1:25:15] appears I said I will go to Windows he
[1:25:19] said type it in typed it in it said God
[1:25:22] is good which I was used to typing it in
[1:25:24] God is good on my docks go cut the Grice
[1:25:27] picked it you know get the garden and
[1:25:29] and do all the work and then finally
[1:25:31] come back in and there it was it's just
[1:25:33] a little slow but you know heart they
[1:25:37] come to some place right well when he
[1:25:43] chopped a tea and I said I'll go home
[1:25:45] we're going with with the windows
[1:25:48] because he I had a reason to know things
[1:25:51] had speeded up I was in the computer
[1:25:55] industry but in a world but not what I
[1:25:58] needed to be all right now what's the
[1:26:02] point if
[1:26:05] the new birth is the foundation of all
[1:26:10] Christianity and if the new birth is
[1:26:15] what Jesus said upon this I'll build my
[1:26:18] rock my church on that rock
[1:26:20] if that's true then we may need to speed
[1:26:25] up our capacity but don't forget your
[1:26:29] foundation what would happen if windows
[1:26:35] went flat you'd go back to gosh but how
[1:26:43] many could handle it no you'd have to go
[1:26:48] back to teach the whole thing over again
[1:26:50] but see that's what we're doing with the
[1:26:52] Word of God we're not studying the Word
[1:26:56] of God to try to find we're trying to
[1:26:58] find secret things would you live in to
[1:27:01] do in the walk dad out there the
[1:27:03] congregation want it they'll be glad to
[1:27:04] hear that yesterday
[1:27:05] they had never seen that before well
[1:27:09] that's not the way that I do I do to try
[1:27:12] to get me and you to understand the Word
[1:27:15] of God because I believe the new birth
[1:27:18] is the birth of the word anything after
[1:27:21] that will be the birth of the word it's
[1:27:23] all right what am i doing then what do
[1:27:26] you mean I don't need a new birth I got
[1:27:29] new birth well brother they'll try to
[1:27:31] get them and people try to get a new
[1:27:32] birth while we weren't wearing born
[1:27:34] again forty fifty years may I quote Paul
[1:27:41] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:27:43] you believe have you grown up and got
[1:27:49] out of Dodge got over into Windows do
[1:27:53] you understand where we're at so God has
[1:28:02] supplied now that's the emphasis I've
[1:28:05] always tried to make God gave the
[1:28:09] Prophet the word that was the purpose he
[1:28:14] was to bring the word that was another
[1:28:15] cough or that he was
[1:28:18] to bring those things turn the hearts
[1:28:21] and the back of Anita all of that was in
[1:28:24] the word but we didn't know it but one
[1:28:28] day we learned that all right now it's
[1:28:33] wonderful to keep on reading the message
[1:28:37] that 50 years later we're still kidding
[1:28:40] from that message revelation enjoined
[1:28:49] reading and going studying the message
[1:28:52] enjoy hearing the Prophet sees a way to
[1:29:03] get the virtues is to do one thing how
[1:29:05] did you get to birth okay how did you
[1:29:11] get the new bar I accepted Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] as my savior and then he accepted me and
[1:29:16] gave me the baptism home to go uh-huh
[1:29:18] he had the Holy Ghost available all you
[1:29:21] had to do is accept it are the virtues
[1:29:25] and things of what we have need of is
[1:29:27] available all we need to do is study the
[1:29:30] prophets message and to see that as we
[1:29:38] do there's no set channel to be able to
[1:29:42] say we need the virtue so let's stand
[1:29:45] let's handle it this way let's do that
[1:29:47] and let's do over here we're gonna we're
[1:29:49] gonna jump over here we don't need to
[1:29:51] know all this about faith and first
[1:29:53] let's jump up here to godliness I think
[1:29:55] what I'll be better human beings we're
[1:29:58] great great that's good we ought to be
[1:30:03] whether we're gonna forget all the other
[1:30:06] you've left your foundation see what I'm
[1:30:12] trying to get you to see is the revealed
[1:30:14] Word of God is the only thing that bring
[1:30:16] you to a birth a revealed Word of God is
[1:30:19] the only thing that can bring you up and
[1:30:20] me up the Statue of a perfect man the
[1:30:22] Prophet brought the word we're not
[1:30:24] listening we're not looking for some
[1:30:26] channel or some thought we have it it's
[1:30:29] already there
[1:30:31] the prophets message is dire
[1:30:34] so let's study that part because that
[1:30:37] was what God spoke to me about is the
[1:30:40] opening of the word I've always loved
[1:30:46] the Bible I've always loved the Word of
[1:30:47] God but it started opening now here's
[1:30:56] our problem we need verses so let's look
[1:30:59] up into Bible devil scripts we can find
[1:31:00] on virtue there's you know there's more
[1:31:03] scriptures in our so then beside the one
[1:31:05] bird around amuse they're speaking of
[1:31:07] virtue of strength well let's just study
[1:31:10] these let's get somebody to explain all
[1:31:12] this about how you do this then it's not
[1:31:14] that have you ever been sitting
[1:31:20] seriously no think because I'm trying to
[1:31:22] explain a very valuable point I don't
[1:31:26] mean mind wandering the word that we're
[1:31:29] sitting I remember when you don't know
[1:31:30] what's going on and you know I look at
[1:31:34] some of you sometimes I thank my lord
[1:31:36] you know you just you over here and over
[1:31:40] there you know what is on their mind but
[1:31:44] listen it will do us no good to bring up
[1:31:54] a reading room situation you know you
[1:31:58] don't want to mean by that not throwing
[1:32:00] off on them that's what you have a
[1:32:01] witness point reading they have a
[1:32:03] reading them they're going to read and
[1:32:04] they teach them how to talk to you and
[1:32:07] what you say they say something back and
[1:32:10] they got all kinds of things all right
[1:32:12] no it's not training us into those
[1:32:15] things
[1:32:16] it's a yielding of our vessel to God
[1:32:23] and what I mean now you listen to what I
[1:32:25] mean in what I'm saying it's not you
[1:32:27] sitting there that your mind is gone and
[1:32:29] you you're not even thinking about
[1:32:30] something all that once whammo here goes
[1:32:32] something with no that not exactly the
[1:32:35] way it is that ain't gonna work that way
[1:32:38] but when you're thinking on the Word of
[1:32:41] God and somebody's speaking if you ever
[1:32:44] done this
[1:32:45] you're engulfed in your thinking about
[1:32:48] the Scriptures you you've got something
[1:32:50] in your mind that you're thinking of and
[1:32:53] the minister or somebody talking to us
[1:32:56] or something says something that goes
[1:32:57] you know just pull off with us what
[1:33:04] you're doing and then now you've changed
[1:33:07] from this thought that you're engulfed
[1:33:09] in to now you're into a different line a
[1:33:12] different thought what has happened God
[1:33:14] is speaking to you is that sensible I'm
[1:33:20] trying to tell you something if you
[1:33:22] listen it's not to try to find how many
[1:33:25] times the word virtue is in the Bible
[1:33:27] and be able to say it's in our 49 times
[1:33:29] in sin River no that's no one here but
[1:33:33] find out about the life of Jesus Christ
[1:33:38] how did he wind up with the strength
[1:33:41] that the woman could draw from and how
[1:33:48] could she see it in him well he was no
[1:33:57] here's what we're gonna get into her oh
[1:33:59] he lives such a good life you won't stay
[1:34:05] the rest of the afternoon you want to
[1:34:08] get into where he planted ropes together
[1:34:10] and run him out of the temple you want
[1:34:13] to get in where he called him first
[1:34:15] issue snakes and he didn't put
[1:34:25] everything down as a flowery bed of ease
[1:34:27] a bunch of roses nor anything did he he
[1:34:29] didn't sugar hid everything he was
[1:34:32] playing but from that
[1:34:36] what about telling a man like Nicodemus
[1:34:38] said Nicodemus you are a teacher he
[1:34:46] credited and gave it to him but he said
[1:34:48] you don't even know these things
[1:34:53] he wouldn't brag it on him too good
[1:34:55] he was telling we're not worried I he
[1:34:59] was telling that it's trouble then he
[1:35:02] was dependent on the wrong time I'm
[1:35:03] trying to get this point in then what
[1:35:05] we're all right think on it you're
[1:35:10] setting you're listening you're studying
[1:35:12] you're meditating you're reading and all
[1:35:14] that once your mind goes into another
[1:35:16] thought room another pattern something
[1:35:20] is revealed to you and you say well I
[1:35:24] wasn't even thinking about that I wasn't
[1:35:29] even thinking on that that form and see
[1:35:33] God is speaking to you that's where
[1:35:36] you're getting the things there's where
[1:35:42] the opening of the word is coming in out
[1:35:45] you remember when the prophet begin to
[1:35:50] talk oh well how much we remember the
[1:35:55] days when we first started you know then
[1:35:59] to hear that prophet explaining said one
[1:36:02] God is simple he said I'm a father I'm a
[1:36:08] human I'm a being he said got many
[1:36:14] manifestations but said there's only one
[1:36:20] God and your mind goes through the whole
[1:36:23] Bible this as it begins to open and you
[1:36:27] see who talk IV Brown
[1:36:28] you see who talked to Moses you see it
[1:36:31] was the same I'm the God of Abraham
[1:36:33] Isaac and Jacob
[1:36:36] knowing that ever one of those was a
[1:36:39] manifestation of God in an hour at a
[1:36:42] time but yet every one of them was the
[1:36:44] same God through the opening of the word
[1:36:49] he will bring into being the nature that
[1:36:52] he wants within you and I is that simple
[1:36:56] to study the Word of God to listen to
[1:37:01] tapes and pray and ask God to reveal
[1:37:05] themselves see that's the way the
[1:37:08] virtues will come the virtues will come
[1:37:12] because of the revealing of the work now
[1:37:13] listen DARS where it's going to hurt
[1:37:16] because you're not studying the message
[1:37:25] you're studying everything else am I
[1:37:30] wrong only through the opening of the
[1:37:39] word can we be brought to anything how
[1:37:45] do we get the virtues well I sneeze
[1:37:47] virtue outer skin or I need knowledge
[1:37:49] I'll just study the Bible that's not
[1:37:51] going to give you knowledge of God or
[1:37:53] what he's talking about
[1:37:56] it's when you come to little situations
[1:37:59] and learn read what that prophet said
[1:38:01] that's what opens it to me when that
[1:38:03] prophet said said look at that he said
[1:38:05] Abraham had knowledge and I thought
[1:38:13] Abraham that knowledge wait a minute
[1:38:18] Abraham wasn't born again well yet God
[1:38:24] enjoyed the thought to meditate with
[1:38:27] Abraham in his thoughts and that's what
[1:38:29] I love about it that Abraham is called a
[1:38:32] father of faith why because God could
[1:38:39] talk to him well how do we get knowledge
[1:38:45] how do we get temperance well we just
[1:38:49] would just not have and we'll we'll beat
[1:38:51] the daylights out of everybody until
[1:38:52] they get to where that's that they're
[1:38:54] acting more nicer that's not gonna
[1:38:56] change nothing cuz that's not what it's
[1:39:00] talking about
[1:39:03] only through the opening of God's Word
[1:39:08] can the virtues be brought into being
[1:39:11] into the hearts and lives of the people
[1:39:14] that and only that is the only way it
[1:39:17] can come he said well what's been wrong
[1:39:20] because we're not reading right so we
[1:39:26] try to hear somebody preach some
[1:39:28] outlandish off-the-wall doctrinal idea
[1:39:32] than to sit down and just talk about the
[1:39:35] word
[1:39:35] I enjoyed that cuz they got into a big
[1:39:41] argument boy boy he was telling him off
[1:39:44] on this side and he was on that side he
[1:39:46] was boy I would having a big well where
[1:39:49] do you go get in the middle of the five
[1:39:51] cuz there's what you won't you try to
[1:39:54] find the Word of God look it away or
[1:39:56] reveal read the Bible and let it just
[1:40:00] become part of you not because you've
[1:40:03] read it but because you can see that
[1:40:07] it's speaking to you come on the Prophet
[1:40:14] said virtue he said that's not living a
[1:40:16] virgin life so he goes over to the
[1:40:21] strength because that's what it is but
[1:40:28] what is strength it was the man himself
[1:40:36] being made manifest
[1:40:38] what are these virtues Christ's own life
[1:40:43] living in us that it see we study the
[1:40:51] word which to me now is this me saying
[1:40:56] the Bible the prophets message because
[1:41:01] they are the Word of God revealed we
[1:41:05] have the Bible we have the prophets
[1:41:08] message that tells us the Bible is right
[1:41:11] not correcting it not changing it
[1:41:15] telling us what it's saying related to
[1:41:18] her Ives now see then by the Word of God
[1:41:27] being revealed then God can add his
[1:41:31] nature through the revealing of the word
[1:41:34] that's what I'm talking about
[1:41:37] I give it about two minutes we'll quit
[1:41:39] revealing his nature through the opening
[1:41:43] of his word and seeing those individuals
[1:41:49] in the word and see how that they were
[1:41:55] living for God in a time when they
[1:41:57] didn't even have did not have the new
[1:41:59] birds it was not there but yet Abraham
[1:42:03] was a friend of God it was it Abraham
[1:42:13] said I know he'll teach his children
[1:42:16] which one was one of them I know I know
[1:42:20] he'll teach his children yet confidence
[1:42:26] God had confidence you know my hand does
[1:42:31] he have that in you and I
[1:42:39] d then it's all the birth of the word
[1:42:46] didn't I listen let's get over onto this
[1:42:50] part these are message the prophet has
[1:42:56] brought us is the Bible brought in to
[1:43:02] not not interpreting it not changing it
[1:43:08] not doing those things but he's saying
[1:43:11] it's meaning what it says and says what
[1:43:13] it means you know it's right he's
[1:43:16] bringing us the clarity of the fact of
[1:43:19] how right it is that we thought we had
[1:43:21] to interpret it some way to get some
[1:43:23] mystery out of it
[1:43:29] I've heard preachers more they try to
[1:43:31] make something they're bringing it so
[1:43:33] great of a mystery and a lot of them Oh
[1:43:35] brain like this I got something right
[1:43:36] here I'm gonna tell you everyone I'm
[1:43:38] gonna tell you in a while but they never
[1:43:39] get over that I want to walk down open
[1:43:41] the book say come on tell me what you
[1:43:43] got well are they trying to entertain me
[1:43:50] or what are they trying to do huh so now
[1:43:54] listen I'm gonna bring this for your
[1:43:57] closing and we'll cover the virtues
[1:43:59] later see what I'm talking about not
[1:44:05] just to read the Bible the Word of God
[1:44:08] the message listen to tapes and things
[1:44:10] but it's when the word is revealed or
[1:44:13] made alive in us
[1:44:15] it will bring into our being the divine
[1:44:19] nature of Almighty God only by the
[1:44:22] Revere word now why don't you want the
[1:44:24] seals
[1:44:26] why don't you want Daniel 7u8
[1:44:40] could it be that we're turning down the
[1:44:41] channel could it be today that we're
[1:44:51] turning down the channel that would come
[1:44:53] forth because hey I I'm gonna read it
[1:44:56] I want this make the statement cuz I got
[1:44:57] it in here in Ephesians forward talks
[1:45:00] about the fivefold ministry being for
[1:45:02] the perfecting of the science brother
[1:45:04] branham put it in the message the statue
[1:45:07] of perfect man to fill him up that I
[1:45:10] make teach others a possible problem now
[1:45:12] listen I'm gonna make this statement of
[1:45:14] you like it now I'm sure you where God
[1:45:17] put that in the word now you show me
[1:45:19] where he took it out you show me where
[1:45:23] he took the fivefold ministry out of the
[1:45:25] word
[1:45:26] well if it is that the fivefold ministry
[1:45:28] is far the perfecting of the science
[1:45:30] then could we be turning down the
[1:45:33] channel that God is using that's as
[1:45:37] simple as I'm asking you that I'm gonna
[1:45:38] finish with this title okay listen
[1:45:43] then the virtues are to be added to your
[1:45:47] faith in your faith is the warning and
[1:45:49] experience your born-again experience is
[1:45:51] the new birth within your soul you go
[1:45:55] with me your faith your birth and all is
[1:45:59] to be dealing with the soul it's not the
[1:46:00] body and spirit God uses that and works
[1:46:03] through it but it's got to be the soul
[1:46:05] of the individual now then if he adds
[1:46:11] the virtues and he's in dire as I quoted
[1:46:14] while ago at the Prophet cities and
[1:46:16] they're waiting on you to bring him the
[1:46:17] word and said he'll make it alive
[1:46:20] alright to add to your virtues why would
[1:46:25] we be afraid to listen to preachers
[1:46:28] preach on some doctrine and ideas and
[1:46:30] things even if if they're just trying to
[1:46:33] straighten something out we can learn
[1:46:35] from that but listen it's added to the
[1:46:41] soul because that's where the new birth
[1:46:43] starts from alright now listen how did
[1:46:46] that woman see or know from Jesus that
[1:46:51] she needed the strength he had
[1:46:53] it was not an automatic process it was
[1:46:56] over a time element of her watching what
[1:46:59] he was doing and may have been you know
[1:47:02] who's right already healed a bunch of
[1:47:05] people and she saw that or whatever it
[1:47:07] is you want to put all that together you
[1:47:08] do that I'm just trying to preach and
[1:47:12] see that woman she saw something
[1:47:16] something that made her think and she
[1:47:22] says that's for me
[1:47:26] she dropped from him what she needed see
[1:47:37] God adds the word to word until we come
[1:47:39] out with the nature of Almighty God is
[1:47:41] that just actual perfect ma'am is that
[1:47:47] they don't listen just a simple thought
[1:47:55] see we're born again in or so we're not
[1:47:57] born again in our body and spirit okay
[1:47:59] now listen for a second huh so being
[1:48:03] born again in our soul that's where we
[1:48:05] begin to work from and that's what all
[1:48:07] connecting what what's your body and
[1:48:10] spirit is involved in it because
[1:48:13] remember the only way people can see God
[1:48:16] is not through your soul because they
[1:48:18] can't see yourself right well they see
[1:48:25] the Menten dollars they see it through
[1:48:28] your spirit they see what your spirit is
[1:48:34] doing your spirit is manifesting what's
[1:48:37] in your soul and see that's why we need
[1:48:42] that spirit to operate from the inside
[1:48:46] come in back out right now listen to
[1:48:51] what I'm saying then get it right so
[1:48:54] what is in my soul will come out in my
[1:48:57] spirit because you cannot see my soul
[1:49:01] other than follow me into the spirit
[1:49:03] room and that's where the deception is
[1:49:05] that
[1:49:06] because people can be Christians and
[1:49:09] spirit now how do you gonna know whether
[1:49:14] they're Christians in spirits or so by
[1:49:17] the word right then what did the Prophet
[1:49:22] say how do you test anybody he said give
[1:49:25] them the word test become the word test
[1:49:32] that's what I'm doing today I'm giving
[1:49:34] the word test every one of us let's see
[1:49:35] if we pass it because you see then I
[1:49:39] don't have any trouble with you know
[1:49:43] thinking about what we do or don't do
[1:49:48] I know preachers that's their basic
[1:49:50] doctrines and ideas is they have to
[1:49:53] preach on own clothes and dress and
[1:49:55] higher and stuff like that and maybe I
[1:49:57] need to preach a whole lot more on that
[1:49:59] but if you're a Christian don't tell me
[1:50:02] you're gonna cut your heart don't tell
[1:50:07] me you're gonna work plants don't tell
[1:50:10] me and you're gonna go out and do this
[1:50:11] or do that we're gonna be on dad they
[1:50:14] don't even talk about that don't even
[1:50:16] mention that stuff to me because it has
[1:50:20] no sense to it the Bible tells us not to
[1:50:24] do things why should we worry well I
[1:50:27] didn't know that to the Prophet see you
[1:50:29] didn't go to church where it was taught
[1:50:31] right okay the Bible didn't change the
[1:50:39] Prophet brought not a great revelation
[1:50:42] to us about hair and dress and clothes
[1:50:44] it was already in the world he just
[1:50:50] emphasized it he put it to wear you you
[1:50:54] had to think about it he put it to her
[1:50:56] and saying if you do these things you're
[1:50:58] not a Christian now you stop and see at
[1:51:01] least your thinking and my Christian do
[1:51:05] I live like one glad like one am i
[1:51:11] turning down the revealed work
[1:51:17] am i turning down the revealed work am i
[1:51:20] rejecting the word of God because it
[1:51:23] doesn't fit my idea or thought
[1:51:26] come on musician what about it we have
[1:51:34] had the most wonderful opportunity you
[1:51:39] not have it if we have a question all we
[1:51:44] got to do is go to the prophets message
[1:51:51] about the answer to all things is laying
[1:51:55] in the Word of God
[1:51:57] yeah but we don't want it knocked out or
[1:52:00] the we're trying to make excuses study
[1:52:07] the word you say how do we get these
[1:52:09] virtuous brother Dale I still ain't got
[1:52:11] that right how do we get them by God
[1:52:13] revealing his word but if we turn down
[1:52:16] the channel that he sends it by if we
[1:52:21] reject the way he sends it then we're
[1:52:26] rejecting them but see we don't take it
[1:52:32] to know what we just take you to what I
[1:52:36] believe well okay we've been around in
[1:52:39] 50 years on what I believe we need 50
