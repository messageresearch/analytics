services even looking forward to hearing about the mission trip and continue and you know it what a blessing it is you get a text from somebody in the philippines but they say they're praying for you

of my heart i want to see you i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you to see you high and live shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] you are holy holy holy holy holy [Music] praise the lord jesus good evening saints trust everyone's doing well by the grace of the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord and we're going to see how this contraption works it says it sounds good and so i'm not too good about having microphones around my head i like him more in my hand but we're going to try and see so um i trust everyone's doing well let's turn to mark chapter 16. mark acts chapter 16. uh you notice that the scriptures i've just been reading it's been missionary minded scriptures and uh because the importance of mission work it wasn't just wasn't invented or just one of the disciples came up with it it was jesus's own words and uh we'll read a quote here in just a moment that where brother branham says something very interesting here but in mark chapter 16 um let's just bow our heads before we read the word our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to serve you lord jesus and to open back the pages of your word father thank you for bringing us here lord and father god we just realized lord that we're insufficient without you lord jesus so we pray oh god that your father just come in our midst lord and have your way father here tonight lord speak to our hajj father god inspire us lord through your word and lord jesus that this last part father of the trip lord god that you you gave us and you directed us lord jesus may it be a blessing father god to those watching and even to those that will watch later lord jesus we just commit ourselves into your hands now and the requests everyone father god that was mentioned into your hands lord this evening we pray these things now in jesus christ's name amen amen mark chapter 16 verse 14 the bible says afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and abraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and in order for them to be damned they would have to have disbelieved the word first so jesus has given here an opportunity for everyone to hear the gospel amen but in order for them to be damned they would have to reject the gospel right and these signs shall follow them that belief in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover notice how everything is so positive they shall so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following praise the lord you may be seated this afternoon this evening let's read this quote here brother branham says the following and the message end time evangelism he says he says here's some he says we know redemption is nigh amen see something's fixing to take place now the world doesn't see that they laugh at it because like they did in other days but we know that it's coming near man if you're if you don't live in this hour amen if you don't realize something is going on you're hiding in a rock you you're you're you you feel like you just want to stay here and and but i'm telling you what things are happening so fast around us and uh that it the only thing to do is nowadays saints is just grab on to him amen there's nothing though don't you have no hopes in banks accounts uh you have no hopes in in in the stock market you have no hope say amen only hope is in his word and what and what you what that what he showed you through his word amen this message that he's given us amen and that's the reason i chose this subject brother branham says for my last for a while for the tabernacle on the end time evangelism and when we are doing mission work or foreign mission with the word of god we know we're always in the will of god because jesus's first commission to his church was go out and preach the gospel that was his first commission to his church this last commission was to preach the gospel also the first time he ever ordained any persons to preach the word and go throughout the country he said heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils as freely as you have received freely give in saint matthew the 10th chapter sending out the 72 by two that was the first commission he gave to his church now the last commission he gave to his church just before he was received up into glory he said go ye into all the world amen so beginning and it ends the same way amen he had just risen from the dead amen so we're always whenever whenever we're in missions we're always in the will of god amen praise the lord jesus and you know uh this beautiful places and beautiful things to to see amen but uh when they when they put a a a a a schedule for you you really don't have time for that and so but um i really learned this and this in this trip that uh we should rest because uh really back to back working it really it really it hurts so as i mentioned sunday you know there were several days where it was just it's like five days straight and some of those days preaching two or three times in a day and it really it really catches on to you think oh i know y'all be fine though it really catches up to you but uh so it's just something that that i learned for next time because you also at the same time you don't want it to be a stumbling block to uh you know to your children as well uh you know they get tired too so they come a point there come a point uh where uh i think one of them zoe was saying we're gonna hear poppy again [Laughter] and then brother eric's little son you know he because brother eric was the one who was riding us around in honduras to the different churches and his little boy i think he's like three years old four years old yeah he's four years old he said we're going to hear brother luis again so yeah but thank god for their patience all right so last time we left we were down here in el banquito i'm sorry in in in choluteca chaluteca honduras this is the border right here of with nicaragua and honduras yeah right here and so that's where we left that so next all right so we were we were here in this area called el tambor and uh in el tambor is where brother eric's father-in-law who is the pastor there and and so we were he was before we had service with them that evening he wanted us to come and see if we could pray for these individuals this this little young brother right here he's uh [Music] he's uh what's the better he has a form of autism but he's he's like 40 something years old he's never been able to walk he's he's just been pretty much just bedridden and so his dad who who who you'll see in just a moment brother cornelio uh he asked that we pray for him and so so we went over to their house and prayed for them next now this is this is that that young man's uh that little brother's grand grandmother she's 94 years old and uh still has a sharp mind she's the honduran version of sister cleta and she remembers a lot of things she was talking to us like she was just a teenager so it's really good to meet her and this is brother robert this is brother eric's father-in-law who's a pastor there in that in that area next all right so this is uh this is brother cornelio this is on a phone call that i was with him about two weeks ago and i want to show you something here real quick the brother cornelio who he's the father of the young man that was in the hammock next now brother cornelio for several weeks before we came over there he was praying to the lord and he asked the lord um that when brother luis would come maybe i could make this request to him and well he this is his house right here and so he he has to take his son and pretty much almost try to carry him everywhere he goes to go use the bathroom everything and it's been like that for 40 something years and so brother cornelius now he's in his late 60s he's he's uh it's been very very tough for him so what they wanted to do is he was he he requested that if he could build a little room right next to his home right here in this area and uh where where there would be a bathroom right there everything needed for that young man to just not have to move him around to different places so um we just put it before the lord prayed for him and i really i really felt uh led up on upon my heart that part of the money that that that you all offered he needed i asked him i said how much do you need did you need for to to build a little room he said uh he told me the amount which would be which would equal to about three thousand dollars so we gave him 1600 uh right there on the spot and and he got to start it he got to working right away next so this is another a picture of that that area next and this is what they've built now within the last two week two or three weeks [Applause] so we gave him the 1600 and um we're probably maybe uh uh i'm trying to see if we could get the the other sixteen hundred to not sixteen hundred thirteen hundred something like that and the other thirteen hundred so that they could finish the roof to the to the to the place so you all pray about that if you wanna help help with that so that way we can finish this room for them but uh he was praying and he was just so thankful to the lord he wasn't expecting that and i said well brother cornelia i said listen you won't know unless you ask the bible says ask and you shall receive you see if you don't seek you won't find so he was just very humble and so that's what they've gotten done so far next and he's been deposited he's been just updating me with with what they've been doing and so really really wonderful all right so that night this is brother robert's church that the brother brother eric's father-in-law and we had service there that night and um and so this is just a little bit of turn it up a little bit so there was about maybe two or three churches that came to to the service as well for mother from other areas next [Music] all right next all right next next this is some of the chur one of the churches they're leaving and packing the truck the 11d god bless you that means god bless all right this is brother robert this is this is eric's little boy i just thought that picture was cute so i put him in there he's a he's a fine looking young boy next all right so from there we went the following day we went to uh el banquito uh which was about an hour or so away from from where we were at uh where the church you just now saw and this is this is brother emeterio brother hemeterio he's one of the oldest pastors there in in at the first church message church that was founded there in honduras and uh and so brother amethedio i believe he is he's in his 80s if i'm not mistaken mid mid 80s it doesn't look like it though and so we had service there he has a really nice church and so this in this area in el tambor it was where the message was first taken to honduras from this place it's been spread throughout throughout all a lot of places in honduras [Music] [Applause] and next is song service there that evening bella's playing the violin back there [Applause] okay next all right next okay so this is one of the little young sisters after the service next all right and then then one of the brothers they invited us to eat at their home so um we are that they're at their home here with this brother emitted and there's zoe with the little girl then afterwards this is at their home the brother they invited us is him right here and he asked if we could pray for his family and pray for his home and so this this area right here has a lot of people that that live here in the united states they got family relatives in florida virginia maryland tennessee as a matter of fact if some of you know who brother danny taurus is from tennessee uh this is this is brother danny brother emeterio the older brother the pastor that that's brother danny torres is a father-in-law so next now this is the brother and i really i could not remember his name but this is the brother that took the message to honduras now it went i believe it was in the is it was in the 60s if i'm not mistaken or 70 something like that but um actually it might have been earlier than that but it wasn't really it was he was it was transitioning he was a pentecostal but believed in brother branham and had heard brother branham and uh took took that uh baptism in the name of lord jesus christ to this area and from there others started going coming to the area and they they preached was preaching the message to them so all right and so here this is brother hob and the reason why i have him here he was taking the pictures but the hub is from another area in honduras and he wanted to go on this trip with us to the other side of honduras where we were at and and so the following day next he asked if we could go pre uh pray for his grandmother who was in the hospital sick in the in the local area so we we we went and prayed for her she's not she's not a believer from what i understand just a catholic lady but she was really really touched by the fact that some random person when wanted to go to the hospital and pray for us so so that's what we did and uh she was feeling much better by the by the when when we left there so thank god all right so uh that evening we uh we had service in another area uh called el triunfo and in el triunfo they planned for us to be there the whole place was packed out and there was about three more churches outside of the uh outside of the building so there was about maybe six churches all together and this and this so we really really had a good time there that that evening it was hot but we uh i really enjoyed myself preaching that that that evening there's bellins as christine singing a special let y'all watch this here for a moment me [Music] all right next [Music] okay next all right afterwards we had uh we had a prayer line and so everybody coming up coming up for prayer we also gave gave out the uh the handkerchiefs and uh there was something that here when we were giving out the handkerchiefs and and the brother the brother right here he's he's a young brother he's stepping in because the pastor of the church here he's he's uh he's very sick and he's he's got diabetes and i think i believe they cut some of his toes off and so he really can't stand and and minister so he's he's pretty much taken over right now and uh but when i when i told him about the the the the little handkerchiefs and it was like it was like all almost all of them just wanted to wanted just wanted one and so we we tried to give as many as we could and then we i just gave the rest to the brother and i said at another time just give it give it to him next and this is afterwards we had some fellowship outside next this is one of the buses that had come for the service that day that evening um i believe maybe there was maybe three churches in there all right and then this is the pastor there at the church and um he's he's he's a he he fellowships he's in his right mind and everything is just that he's he's gotten much older now and he's not really able to minister anymore next all right so that evening that was um that was on uh let's see when that was that was on the 30th right it was like january it was december 30th when we were there's uh so or december yeah something like that and we needed to head back on the to the uh back to where brother eric and uh where they live which is about four hours away about four almost five hours away that same evening we needed to be back uh there and uh so this is us just stopping and getting us getting us some snacks and it was probably what it was like one in the morning there next all right so the following day we um while we were there in choluteka where we were ministering to those churches we had bought brother eric's wife a a tin where she could have some uh you know a lot of rice a plastic bin so we went out and bought her a like 25 pounds of rice and that's me uh doing the work it wasn't heavy [Laughter] this was bella bella was working while we were there in talanga and this is the little store where she was working at this is brother brother uh uh eric's uh wife and and and her mother-in-law they they sell tortillas in this place and that's why it's called tortilla and so that's how they make some money you know and and they helped support themselves and so bella was there helping them they also they also this is eric's mother she's very entrepreneurial and during the december they sell fireworks um there's a big big business there in december so next all right so on the 31st of december we had a like a watch night service that evening and this is at the brother eric and this is at their church next and a lot we had a lot of specials that evening it probably went to about 11 o'clock at night next there's a little boy giving a special [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right next okay that's me ministering there next by the time i came out everybody was already tired already special doubt i already uh testified out so it was uh but afterwards we had we had some uh late a late dinner with everyone and uh had some fellowship afterwards next here's some of the young people from brother eric's church next all right this little girl right here um is her name when i was eating there at one of the tables she asked me she said she said how does it feel to have a dad and it was just a random question and i said well um you know it's a wonderful feeling to you know and i was just kind of talking to her and so she would she came to my wife and was asking her the same you know kind of the same things come to find out she told us the story she said that she had seen her dad uh when she was younger she's 10 11 9. when she was younger she saw her dad laying on the on the street he got shot he got killed and so he she didn't know what had happened to him and so she lost her her father at a very young age so she's she has this this uh i'd ask that you all pray for her because she has this thing that's really it's bothering her for her not to have a dad she's grown up without a dad and uh my wife was able to minister to her in the way because she's lost her father so and so they they uh my wife christine really connected with with her so just remember her and your prayers next all right so the following day after we had uh had that watch night service um we got to bed maybe a while two in the morning we only got maybe like one hour of sleep and uh had to leave out about three three thirty in the morning back to the other side of of of honduras where we were where we were preaching where the bus was at uh because that's where the border to honduras and nicaragua uh the best place to to get uh to cross was that area so we we drove out this is us right here at the border and uh this is some of the men they're they're trying to take our luggage and you have to kind of be careful with these with these man they they want to help out but they really want to help out they they they're gonna try to take as much money from you as possible so next um just kind of pointing out where we were we were kind of around right here now next so it was that zoe yes with only less than maybe no sleep she had not gotten sleep that that that morning that's us trying to cross over next this is my face trying to deal with these guys [Laughter] and uh because they tell you one thing they say listen i'll take your things we'll cross over to the border to nicaragua and for a certain price and when you get there they start quoting you another price and i said wait a second no you told me this price and so and when you when you you know call them out they're like okay yeah yeah you're right next this is us this is me and bella and uh usually uh since this was january the first uh usually it's uh there's more traffic going on more going on but uh hardly anybody was was awake that that morning everybody had partied and drunk the the the night before so there was we easily got through it was just very hot this is right here at the border of honduras and nicaragua next i just wanted it was so laid back this is at the that the uh uh immigration in nicaragua that you know they they have you know don't use your cell phone they have you know things they don't use your cell phone and i was using my cell phone and it was before i had seen the sign christine pointed that out [Laughter] but they had they had told me they had told uh they had when we were here crossing the border they they were looking at me kind of strange because i was here i was walking with with three girls mine and they look like miners because christine you know looks just like she's my daughter so they're looking at me strange and they're asking me who are who is this i said that's my wife and then when they would see it in the passport okay they thought i was smuggling children over across the border but after all that we got through just fine brother neil's son um well you'll see here in a little bit brother nilsson and brother giovanni who's his brother he's the pastor but nielson is the pastor here in china nicaragua this is now nicaragua and this is the his church here so the following day after we crossed over we had service here next this is a song service my brother nielsen's church [Music] they have some excellent musicians here at this church next that's brother nielsen's wife by the way who was playing there with with with bella this is the church where my wife was saying that she testified last sunday where she had that heat stroke it doesn't look hot but it was hot and they told us that that day when i was preaching there and i wasn't feeling well i was already coming down with something because from here we were getting ready to go uh to the it was when we were going to go to the to the jungles uh about a day or two later but that got delayed and that that we didn't end up going to that because several people were sick including me and but i believe it was the will of the lord for us not to go but um they said that that day when we preached there it was the hottest that they had ever seen been in the church and i preached there several times but didn't see it any different from any other time but they said it was the hottest so so i guess it affected christine next [Music] all right this is just you could turn it up a little bit a little taste of some of the streets of chinandega nicaragua [Music] and the activity that goes on we're parked we're parked right here next to a car so we're like taking up a bunch of space we're creating traffic we're yeah we're creating tracks here comes a horse bicycles everything [Music] and no one's upset nobody's honking no life goes on next all right this is kind of good idea a little traffic chinondega is a very nice little little city kind of town town but it gets busy all right so so since we didn't end up this is brother nielsen by the way and since we didn't end up going to um which is on the west coast on the east coast of nicaragua we had to cancel that for several people were sick including the interpreter that was going to go over there to interpret because over there in that area they have their own dialect and so you have to have you can preach in spanish but you have to have uh somebody interpreting into their dialect and the interpreter was sick himself so we i told brother nilson i said bro nielsen it's probably not the will for us to go not the will of the lord for us to go so we didn't go but we ended up uh scheduling um setting up to visit other places that needed to be visited as well and when brother nielsen was setting up those places i mean they just they were just coming up like that you know like so we knew that it was this that's where the lord was leading us so this is us heading to one of the places right here this is we're heading to monchones nicaragua next and it's a mountainous area and um just beautiful next next all right so we visited bro uh brother um beset i forgot the brother's name now uh but this is his church and the brother he's an older brother he he uh he uh he's been he's the one who pretty much evangelized this whole area that whole mountain air plays there since the 70s when he came he came he heard the message in 1976 if i'm not mistaken next and this is his this is his little church right there and so we started having survey we had about three three day service there from uh friday saturday and sunday next this is some of the sisters from there in that area next this is the this is the pastor there brother the brother and uh he he had not spoken in a while but that evening he wanted to just kind of testify and give and and just let the congregation know and just we really enjoyed it next so afterwards we we had uh this is some of the church age books that some of the brethren uh brother george smith and them had provided uh to them and we had taken them over to them in this area and uh we gave we gave gave them out and uh so there was a picture of them receiving it next this is the pastor here and uh just it's real real wonderful to hear you know his testimony of how the lord dealt with him and you know by the lord dealing with him and and what he did you know there's a church and several churches in other places around the region as well next all right this is the this is the pastor's son and so we this is uh the day when we were heading back to another area called plan de grama which was about another about an hour and 20 minutes from from where we were at right here in monchones next and this is the church here in plan de grama this is the pastor there the grammar he prayed for the brother the brother he [Music] he he had a fall [Music] about a year or so ago also had coveted and something with that fall caused him uh to um it messed him and messed him up in in his head mentally uh he hit his he hit the side of his face and so whenever he would get up to preach to minister he would always just minister the same thing over and over and over and they knew something was something was wrong and so whenever you talk with him whenever he talks to you he always talks to you about the same subject and it's like he's never you know so y'all just remember the brother and prayer he knows something's wrong and and and so just difficult things that churches are going through as well you know amen uh this is a ministering there that one of those evenings and then this is some of the people there at the church next you turn it up a little bit we just got through service and getting ready to go to a little place called plantagramma brother you say yes you're next to me by the name son brother and his wife back there we got for the island back there i forget all these people's names i can't remember names i'll remember faces all day long but i just names i just they slipped me all right so after after we we just had wonderful services there that could tell you all different testimonies there when we were there in monchones plan de gramma and but afterwards uh this is uh back in in in in this area right here is is a uh is a piece of land that about two years ago i had requested uh if some of you brethren could help pay for the for actually no it was just recently this is the piece of land that we helped pay uh where they're going to start building the church and so i wanted to visit that that that piece of property and this is some of the people at the church this is brother allen this is his dad uh and he he's a pastor there in the in the capital of managua uh in in nicaragua and brother allen is kind of helping this group he's not their pastor but he's just kind of helping this group and the group is growing uh it's more than these it's just that that's who was there at the moment next okay so actually this this kind of got out of order i put this picture here because while we were up in the mountains in monchones in nicaragua bella had her birthday she turned 15 and so um i hate that i wasn't there with her but uh we we we made it up with for her 15 year old 15 year old there in central and in latin america is like a sweet 16 here in here in the state so it's a it's a big deal over there so next [Music] and so this is uh them at brother nielsen's mom's house and the brother is playing the drums on his laptop [Music] all right next okay and this is some of the little kids there at brother neat this is brother nielsen's uh brother nielson's son um and then some of the other little kids there in his church in that in that region there's a lot of volcanoes so very beautiful though and they're active as well next all right so bella and my wife and zoey while we were still up in the mountains they were having service uh at the same hot church next in chinandega zoe playing a special [Music] i think bella is singing with brother nolvin all right now this is the little house right here that um that we helped build last year for the couple who had lost their little baby so they go to brother nielsen's church and so while we while i was up in the mountains my wife she visited them they were only about eight blocks away from the church this is the little house right here that you all helped out with next this is inside this is brother the the brother next this is where they wash their dishes next and so that's the that's them they send their greetings and to you all by the way it would have been four of them but they lost their little their little one all right this is the property right here that i was telling you all that we helped uh pay for pay for it it's been paid for thank god they had a loan a loan on it but but grace of god has been paid for and uh now they're gonna start building pretty soon next and they're all going to do the work themselves next okay so we one of the places that we had planned to go was to an island called the island of ometep and that island is one of the seven one of the seven wonders of the world if i'm not mistaken because it's an island that has two volcanoes in on on an island two active volcanoes um several miles in between and it's very a lot of a lot of uh people go there uh tourists go there um from europe united states but uh there's also a church there a message church there are several several believers there so we went over there to to visit them because they don't get visited much and so that's where we were heading there right right here in this picture next this is the island where we're heading to the island this is one of the volcanoes it's located in the middle of a lake so um and one of the volcanoes has a lake inside the volcano so you can actually get inside that water and it's warm water next all right and this is uh this is the pastor there i believe his name is brother juan and uh and we're just having some fellowship after one of the services uh we had about three day services there next and then we had a service outside of the sisters the sisters home right here and uh we had a really good time you know people as people were driving by tourists were walking by and uh they were just wondering what was going on while we were having church next and uh we preached there about he's the vine and you are the branches next this brother right here he's that sister's uh uh son and uh he he's he's a nominal a nominal man but uh he was really touched by the by the message and uh wanted to go and visit the church the the have service with us the next day and uh next and this is christine with the sister she's she's one of the the veteran message believers there in that in that area next this is one of the volcanoes there as we were driving by beautiful next and this is the lake right here and this is me and zoe when we had some leisure time as the sun was going down next this is bella that was the following morning hey zoey wanted to really really uh go swimming so we made sure we did that because i did too and this is one of the services this is that brother juan's church um right here next um just wanted to point this out next uh go back go back brother pause it this sister right here uh right before we had this last service brother juan and another brother from from the church they wanted to go and visit the sisters the sister and her family and so she was uh they were the lord was dealing with her and she wasn't a christian but uh we were able to talk to her about the lord she's having she has a son who has a who has a problem health-wise we talked talked to her about the lord just shared the gospel with her and her brother and and she we led her to the lord that afternoon and she came to the lord and that evening she she wanted to come she wanted to come to church and you know she had the option to get baptized because the lake was just right across the street but uh hopefully she makes that decision she didn't she didn't right there and then but we just thank god for that next next i was given one of my animated presentations dog at church next all right afterwards we had a prayer for for the sick next and in that area they have monkeys so you can look in the in the in the in the uh in the trees and you could just see monkeys this is the only one we saw but they're all they're they're all over the place i don't have the p i didn't put this picture up but it was funny uh because as we found this monkey to us oh wow look at that monkey up there and we were videoing and there was two other little kids that live in the area just sitting over there on the side of the curve and they were they had like they had their phones and they were just sitting there on their phone monkeys up there like that's we see that every day but to us it was wow next all right this is some of some of the area there next all right one of the evenings we had a little fellowship just [Music] next okay this is some of the brother juan's uh family in that in that area next uh and there was this place there that i love ice cream and we ate coconut ice cream homemade coconut ice cream with a bunch of coconut in it um and we we we we we bought ice cream for all for like 10 of them they would go with us mostly young people kids you know and you'd give look at the size of this right here and we bought about maybe 10 of those it was only like 14 bucks for the whole thing and it's just very cheap and we ate ice cream almost every night [Laughter] that's why i gained six pounds [Laughter] um so this is us uh uh when we when we left the island or we were getting ready to leave i can't remember exactly but we were we were heading back now next and that morning um is when we were gonna cross over into costa rica next and uh this is me taking a little nap on the ship on the boat because from the island to the mainland it was about an hour or hour or so and so this is me taking a little nap next all right so this is us here at the border of nicaragua and and and costa rica now we're getting ready to cross over next now this is us crossing over so now we are we are right here where we crossed over next all right and then we met up with brother eric check on brother eric chacon who's the pastor there who was going to receive us in grecia uh uh costa rica he picked us up met us there at the border from where he lives in grecia to the border there uh it's it's about four hours four hours so he picked us up and we went to go visit brother daniel vado who is one of the pastors there there in costa rica he's more closer to the coast there next this is uh us in that in that re region where brother daniel vado's church is in guanacaste costa rica next so that evening we had service here and this is brother daniel's uh uh church daniel vado i didn't have a picture here of him but he has a powerful testimony he the um he uh he was suffering with cancer if i'm not mistaken and the lord healed him from that i mean he was he was to the point of death and he tells us amazing testimony of things that he saw people coming in the room and and and just supernatural things that took place while he was the lord raised them up and he's he's pastoring the church and uh just a wonderful testimony that he had but that's just kind of it in a nutshell um that evening we we when we preached there there was two young men who were who were just recently coming to the church and you know as a minister sometimes you you don't know what you're going to preach and so you kind of turn back maybe to some previous notes that you've had and maybe the lord is leading you to them so i i did that and i i ministered that evening and i ministered on eating eating the lamb and uh and it really touched their hearts because they were they were on the fence about getting baptized and uh and about what the new birth was was was about and and you know and uh they told brother daniel bado the pastor there they text messaged him the the uh or that evening one of them said that they wanted to get baptized and that the next day and so um but they he could not get he didn't the next day when the next day rolled around he decided not to only because when he told his mother who was a staunch catholic who was a staunch catholic that he was going to go do that she really got upset with him so he he held off but was going to get baptized at a later time and i believe brother daniel he's sending me some pictures i believe he did get baptized and the other young man who who he got baptized as well so at least we planted the seed somebody else did the work amen but the seed was planted there and god does the increase amen next this is this is brother daniel the the pastor there this is at the church in costa rica they're very more strict in regards to to following the covet guidelines and so that's why you see a lot of the spacing and the masking next and this is one of the places there near the church they they're just right there right off the coast and um and i just couldn't help myself i i told my wife i said i'm just gonna just i'm just gonna dip my feet in the water and me and zoe you know because zoe wanted to get in the water and it ended up being everything was in the water after and then zoe was like zoey said papi are you really okay she got in it and so yeah next next all right so afterwards we uh after we visited brother daniel we drove for uh four hours back to gracia uh uh costa rica and this is where the eric chacon's church the brother that picked us up from the from the border and this is us having service sunday morning next so what they did is in order to keep the guidelines covered guidelines they they would just keep uh families together you know and and and so this is this is his church there next this is just right outside of his church in the view next next all right so while we were there um while we were there the we were we were out if you want to pause it for a moment [Applause] that was the last service of the trip by the way i was like i was like yes but no at the same time you know because you knew that we were getting ready to leave and uh but uh while we were getting our covet test um they they had prepared we nobody we didn't know anything about it but when we came back after getting the kova test for us to be able to get on the plane the the next day to fly back they had uh they had they did like a little surprise party for bella and then we came back and uh so they they got her a cake and some of the young people there and they started singing happy birthday to her next you can play it this right here the the older sister there is brother eddie eric mother-in-law which is her mother which is that's her best brother eric's wife and uh bella just really got you know taking a liking to her and they really just just to each other and so so this is uh the last night there before our trip they took us kind of sightseeing in the in the area this church right here is a catholic church a very very old church and we were down here in the steps and i i know i looked on the ground and i noticed the ground was moving and when we looked down it was just trails of ants everywhere and i'm talking about some big ants and uh it was just just interesting it looked they looked kind of strange next all right so brother eddie the following day took us to the airport this is us getting ready to walk through security and this is our final picture there before our trip was over and so next this is us heading back and so here i just wanted to thank you all for your prayers thank you very much for your patience too throughout this this presentation and uh god bless you all and uh we'll see when the lord opens doors for us to go again by the way this is a big old turtle head made out of stone so all right praise the lord jesus well we can turn on the lights [Applause] yeah there are so many details and things we could go through but would we we'd have two weeks worth of presentations i know maybe some of the young people some of the kids would like that but but uh yeah i appreciate each one of you and and uh i tell you what you know and i encourage you know our young people encourage anyone that you know if we ever make a trip out there and if you really feel pressed on your heart you know to to to come with us we we'd be more than glad to have you with us especially young or young people i think if you get an experience like that you know you come back appreciating what you have here more and appreciate things a little bit better and see things maybe in a different way and so um it was just it's just wonderful to be to see other people who are pressing on just like you are and i would always tell them listen we're battling over there in the states the same devil that you all are battling it's the same devil i mean they have difficulties but i tell them but the devil up there is the same devils they're just a little bit more sophisticated the ones we have we battle here they hide themselves a little bit better over there they're just plain you know yeah and so but you pray for those people there and pray that the lord would continue doing the works in the many lives that the word has touched and we just thank god for giving us the strength and for using us uh in those places and we just appreciate you all for pitching in amen financially with your prayers so um let's stand to our feet this evening amen we're just gonna have a word of prayer i'm gonna have the musicians come by the way do we have anything we need to mention just remember brother richard hi he'll be with us this weekend he'll be preaching both services yeah the brothers down there they asked me when are you coming back i mean it's just like you just left even before you leave when are you coming back so you all pray for us we don't know we don't know what will happen from now until then but uh if the lord has us to be there again we'll we'll be there um maybe next time around we'll be able to visit those jungle areas where we didn't get to go last time who knows why we didn't get to go it was just very interesting that we had we had already planned for six months to go to that place and in in a day it was every i was sick brother nielsen was sick the interpreter brother was sick his brother nielsen's dad had gotten sick and had was taken to the hospital and so brother nielsen didn't want to be 12 hours away from where his his dad was at and his dad already worries when he goes to those places so it just really didn't pan out but but you see if if we had not if if if we had gone then that maybe that young sister who who accepted the lord would not have accepted the lord so it's just the lord does things and he understand we we don't know we don't know why but uh he has he knows all the details the ins and outs and we just want to obey so let's just go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you once again lord for the opportunity to serve you lord in this hour lord we appreciate your heavenly father lord father some
