and speak to the author our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord for another opportunity to be in your house Lord that we're just able to gather in Lord is all the things that are happening in the world and Lord there's a lot of uncertainty a lot of distress but Lord we know that there's a place to run to Lord there's a place of refuge to enter in Lord and we can just let off the pressure there's no distress there's no worry Lord because we can't we know what is certain Lord and we know what is truth and we know what is real and father we just pray tonight you just come

them and and touch them in a special way tonight Lord just give us what we have need of tonight Lord Lord whatever the needs are father I pray that you just go and minister to each one follow you know each heart Lord you know what each need is but even before we ask or do you know what it is in your have the answer for it Lord you've already paid the price for it all and Lord we're just so thankful for that Lord and we just give you praise and we just look under you tonight Lord for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen first John chapter one and my title tonight is walking in the light as he is in the light and that's very important because you know people walk in a light but they don't walk in the light as he is in the light because that's what John tells us he said but if we walk in the light as he is in the light and that's what I want to look at tonight he says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it bear witness and show it unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that we that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin and if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in this man god bless you tonight may be seated this is this is from the message there is a man that here they can turn on the light brother brems says he is the light the truth the light and there is no darkness in him and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word and the word is the light that's right because he spoke and he said let there be light that was the word that become liked when he speaks this it's not the light of that eight it's the light of that age each time now here he is here in not in a glare but people are living in a glare but he is but he is the vindicated word he is absolutely the light in the time of darkness yes sir all these false glares and things will fade away yes sir he is here don't fear turn on the lights his promise word it lives makes it may he but he that believes in me the works that I do ye shall you do also that is the word then it is the word as the father sent me so send I you the father that sent him come in him the Jesus that sent you comes in you and the works that he did then he does the same thing because why the word has made flesh in human flesh manifest itself as the light of the day there we are there it is it just is showing the way to light in the light wise men who are not blinded by Creed's and denominations will walk in that light amen god bless you because that's what i want to talk about it was walking in the light as he is in the light and brother Brandon brings out two things he talks about there being darkness but he also talks about being a glare and I want to talk about those two things because you know there is people that walk in darkness but there is you know walking in a glare in a false light brother bream talks about it hey coach about a mirage people looking in a mirage and seeing it's just a false light but I want to look at that tonight because you know the light has come and the light has been given to us and we are to manifest that light because we have become that light if the if the word is in you then you are the light of this hour because you are the light of the world jesus said I'm the light of the world but then he said ye are the light of the world so identified you because if we if we have become as brother Brian was speaking here you know if we have become that light because the was the word the vindicated word is the light of the hour and if it's the vindicated word then you become the vindicated word of the hour and you become the light of the world you became the light that he's that God had made manifest he says there is a man here that can turn on the lights alright what does he do by vindicating his word for this day Jesus the Son of God who promised the word for this day is right here with us don't be scared don't pay any attention to what they're doing you do you'll walk in darkness be was they that do wise Daniel said and these last days will do exploits for their God see they'll walk in the light as he is in the light so that that's the thing is to walk in the light as he is in the light because that's what God came to do is identify through the scripture what the day and hour in which we live all in every age and every time God wanted to make known himself and he did through the word and even from the beginning he made itself known and that was his oh the opening of the word him speaking the word as he talked a brother Brent talked about he said that him being the son of God him being the logos and then he stepped out from God to speak and he said let there be light and there was like and he said brother branham said he believed his word he spoke the word and he believed the word and it became light because you know what that's what that's what he was supposed to do that's exactly what was to come forth from him and he believed what he spoke and it came to pass and then it's the same way today one because it's the same God doing the same thing today and so the word you and I have been given to speak you know we are to believe that word well because he's the same he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he give us a word to speak if you give us a word in our day to believe and to proclaim then you know what we believe that word and we speak it because you know we don't have to worry about trying to bring anything to pass we just believe what God said we just speak what God said because he's obligated to bring it to pass he's obligated to fulfill the work it's not our job to do that it's his job to do that well because it's the bridegroom's job to take care of these things it's not the bride the bride is to speak he said because the bride is to become into speaking condition1 because she's supposed to come to a place where she can see the word and understand the word and understand that she is him that she can speak the same word and do the greater works when Jesus said the works that that I do he said you'll do also so when when the devil comes against us her problems comes our way that we wonder if we can overcome no we don't have to worry one because we've already overcome one because he said I've already overcome the world and you have to but the problem is is you we've got to believe that we are overcome too we are more than conquerors through him that loved us if we can see one because if the light is shining on the word for our day than we can see who we are but not just but not just see the word but we are to become that word we had to become that light as as Peter said we'll get into it later he's it as in that day dawn and he said in the day star rise in your heart see there's a there's a light that shines on the word but you know the word has to be in us this in Matthew 26 22 and 23 says the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light and if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness so as we know the light that was in us is to be our eye they said our eye is to be single he said if your eye is single then the whole body is light so there's no confusion if you know what you're looking at if you know where you are then your body can be full of light but you know the problem is is if you are as Jesus was speaking of here if your eye is single and they don't mean to have one eye but that means whatever you're looking at has to be in one focus Pass has to be exactly on the right thing so if your eye is focused on what needs to be focused on then it brings light to your body because you know what you can't have pard truth you can't you can't be looking at one thing and looking at something else but you've got to be focused both eyes focused on one thing because you know later on whether I'm talked about looking at a mirage see if you if you know what he said if you see that your eye has to be single well if you look at a mirage then you if you understand how am I wrong what a mirage is then you understand your eyes not single so he said if your eye be single he said then the whole body shall be full of light then you know what you're looking at because sometimes see the devil puts things in front of you that are a is a mirage is an optical illusion that when you're looking at something what look that's not true it's not exactly what you're saying you know many many years ago I preached on you know truth versus reality you know we live in a world that it's all about reality you know it's all reality shows and everything's virtual reality in this reality you know and all these top things there everything is about being real you know I'm just going to be real you know everybody talks about being real well you know what it's not about being real it's about the truth you know the thing is it's not it's not about being real because you know what let me tell you when when the Hebrew children were standing in the fire those flames were real when Daniel was in a lion's den he was in there with real lions you know those things when the Egyptian army was behind Moses and the children of Israel that was a real army and they could really kill you but you know what the truth was that God told him he was going to bring them out every single one of them he told even when the Hebrew children come there and said you know what our God is more than able to deliver us from these fiery furnace these flames but you know what even if God don't we're still not going to bow to this image we're still going to stand for the truth and look and Daniel he said you know he just went down in there one because he was going to pray to his God he didn't matter what anybody said to him or whatever anybody tried to hold over and he was still gonna follow the word he was still the one because something had illuminated him and he was standing in the light for his day in his hour and he was standing there and he said even if I go in before these Lions they can't touch me unless God allows it and those and those will those children of Israel Moses leading them out they had a pillar of fire and it had a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night so they were still following in the light of the word for their day that was leading them and he led them to the Red Sea but you know what they were standing there but you know God had already told them I'm going to deliver you and you know what there was nothing gonna stand there and hold them back because God told Moses spake and go forward speak the word why because you've been commissioned to it's your commish and to speak the word what it doesn't look like there's any way out God's made a way out he's giving us the way he's giving us the word so he just carry on through because we have the victory he's giving it to us if we just keep our eyes single and look at what God has said what God has called us to he said he said brother I said in secondhand robe he said what we need today is faith in the promise of God and don't pay no attention to what this one says or that one says and he talks about a brother had had two girls that were mutant he was talking about divine healing he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God show raised them up he said if I can make one deaf mute to hear he can make if he can make one deaf mute to hear he can make another deaf mute to hear we know by infallible proof that he does that he said keep our faith on the promise i single our ear single our heart single and one thing on Jesus Christ that he's able to perform that which he has God made the promise he said God was the one that said it so if he said it then that's what we have to let's all we have to do is look at what he said because God is the one that said because he said you know we don't have to pay attention to anything else because we keep our eyes single our heart single our ear single we're listening to the word we're following and keeping our eye on the word and we don't have to worry about anything else because nothing else is going to matter then we can overcome God has given us the word to overcome if we can believe it's it's Earth's to believe or not to believe but that's all God can do is make his keep it make the way before us and for us to see these things and you and so if we walk in the light as he is in the light and so you know if you go through the scripture there's many in the scripture that has walking in the light of their day and then you know sometimes it just becomes repetitious to people or it just it's just you know that's what mama said or you know that's what the preacher said or you know they just go through the motions and and it's not a reality to anybody you know brother Brown was speaking of Mary listening then she was talking about listening to the rabbi's speak to the great things that that the great Jehovah God had done through the ages and and all of the things that they had talked about and then he was reading the scripture and and you know Mary and Joseph was speaking and reading at Isaiah and they were talking about the things that God had done and the God things that God had promised in their day and you know you know and then and then the clergy or the rabbis and the Pharisees and all that you know they just stand it well you know God used to do these things but you know we've not seen God do anything and we go we wonder if God's just turned his back on us and and God don't do these things anymore and you know and Mary sitting there listening and talking to Joseph and said you know you know God is still the same that he always was and know even though the rabbi may not believe it or nobody else believes that she said but I still believe that he said these things and he's going to bring it to pass why because he's the same one that brought all those through the through the Red Sea and all the things that's happened in the past and we've seen God doing and he's the same one and you know she began to ponder these things in her heart you know she had she had heard the word and she had been read the word and she believed the word and you know even her confession was the word and she continued confessing what was the word to her and it was through it was something that was real to her and she began to walk forward in that and you know then all of a sudden one day and she was walking along and you know brother Brent tells it in a different way so what happened but you know all of a sudden she's walking along in this kind of a dark area or you know doing the laundry or whatever and the next thing you know there's this great light that surrounds her that engulfs her or whatever and then you know all of a sudden this man steps out before her and said blessed Mary said God has granted you favor why because you know here you hear you've all all these years you've believed this word you you've read this word you've claimed this word that God was going to do this that you knew what the prophet Isaiah said was going to take place and guess what you're going to be the one that's going to fulfill this word and Gabriel began to expound to her the scripture and what was going to take place and you know she was troubled at it and you know everybody whoever anybody would brother Graham said even I was standing in the presence of an angel you know you didn't being scared but in April said don't you worry don't fear about this because this is - God has granted you favoring God's gonna do this and you're gonna be G and she said how this how can this be saying that I know not a man they said don't you worry the Holy Ghost is going to come and overshadow you and you're going to bring forth the promised word you don't have to worry about it while you can just walk in the light as he is in the light you just walk in the light that he is showing and then all of a sudden you may not be standing in a physical light but the light will open up and you'll walk in that light and she said being unto me according to thy word Lord just let me be your handmaiden and bring forth the word let me be just your simple servant and bring forth the word and then she could bring forth the word and actually what's standing and walking in this in this light and you know all the ones around the around the community and everything you know they you know how can this be cheetah she's no she doesn't come from a very good family you know her family's not you know the upper echelon of our community you know she's just some lowly little girl you know and she just not what we consider you know that God would come in and deal with but that's alright God likes the humble and the lowly and God like someone's like to use the ones that nobody else considers you know just like just like David when they when he tried all the other brothers you know and there's like hey you got anybody else gods refused all the rest of them and then he had to have a second thought oh yeah there's one more oh yeah that's the one yeah well that's the one that God wants God wants the one that nobody else wants he can use those kind of people we don't have because man will overlook what God is trying to do because what man thinks is great God calls foolish and what God thinks is great man calls foolish that's the reason it takes us to die to ourselves that he can come to live that we can see what's truly important what's truly real what needs what is truly what God sees is eternal because you know if we tried to figure this thing out on our own you know we'd be in a world of hurtin we'd be a million miles off the just reason it takes dying out to ourselves and allowing him to come and lead that he didn't come to in that he can lead us so we can see what's what's truth because nobody's ever going to try to figure out what truth is unless unless it's the true one right he is the truth and he's the only one that can bring the truth so as we see Mary continue you know she's carrying this and you know here she is and and you know it's it's odd to live in this world but you know she's carrying this this word she's carrying this gift that God has given her and you know here here she is carrying this and you know and she knows and nothing's happened to her physically but you know what the the holy spirit overshadowed her and then and then she goes and speaks to Elizabeth that proclaims the word and then all of a sudden in an Elizabeth wound here's here's John that hadn't moved you know late lady assume that he was dead or whatever you know she had a problem and all of a sudden he leaps in the womb at the name of Jesus you know here it isn't that Elizabeth she is she begins to get all excited and thank the Lord you know that here is here's the one that we've heard so much about our Messiah is coming that she that she knows all of a sudden here's here's God's going to do this work that a that he's promised you know 800 years later or whatever here it is it's finally going to come to take place you know there were there was times that you know Mary had to face a lot of criticism and she had to face a lot of ridicule why because you know nobody was going to face and nobody was gonna believe that this little girl this young girl was going to be the one that was going to carry the Messiah was going to fulfill the scripture can you imagine all of the young women and all the young girls for 800 years these women had walked along and you know they had read this scripture and no doubt people had set there and thought you know am i go to be the one you know you know I you know it wouldn't it be great to be the one and you know people's like well I wonder who it would be well you know everybody thinks it's got to be the it's got to be you know the upper it's got to be the the Pharisees or the you know the the scribes are the rabbis or whatever it's got to be it's got to be on the upper echelon or some of the rich people in town or you know the ones that are very famous you know there's got to be a certain group that you know and it can't be just just some little simple person that nobody would you know that nobody would give a second thought to but here they are for 800 years people been looking and thinking oh wonder if it's going to be in my lineage you know everybody's were you know looking to see what was going to take place and it's like mary says that she's gonna carry the Messiah she's got a uh she's a brick shy of the load if you got a wire loose how ridiculous do you see what her family you see what see how our family lives do you see what they own they do you see the kind of church they go to you see her or a rabbi is you know that all of these things they don't see what God is doing and it doesn't matter what kind of background you come from we all come the same way we all came needing a Savior you know we all have faults and our failures and it's not it's not looking out the outside it's looking on the inside because that's what God was looking for he was looking on the inside of the man he was looking on the inside of a girl that would believe that she had that she had a real faith to believe what God had said even though it looked impossible God she still believed what God had said and here she goes carrying this child all this way and then you know even Joseph had had his doubts and you know the angel had to come and God had to come speak to him and and explain these things to him that he had to come and get a real revelation of what was going to take place and actually believe this thing and you know carry you know continue on through all of this and you know and then and then you know they had to go to Bethlehem for the for the taxes and all those things and you know and here they are going through all this and you know knowing that God is coming to do something and you know it looked dark and and all these type things but you know God was going to fulfill his word and you know here they come and you know you you look and you know you wonder how Mary felt when when you know they get to town and everything's packed out and everything's sold out and there's no place to be and then you got to go to this the only place that you can find is you know you know the stable which is you know just the the barn or you know where all the animals are and everybody that's been riding and walking and everything all that all this way and ever you know most likely it was probably packed out because there was so many people come to town and then here you are trying to scrounge around in this little stinky place trying to find a place to give birth to the to the creator of the world and this little stinky little stable and it's maybe crowded and here you are trying to find something to scrounge together to deliver your Messiah and here it is in this in this little way and you know and you're all the things that Mary had to endure all the way through but you know she never lost her faith and believing who she who it was and who she was because you know it wasn't anything in her that was any good because God did go gave her Grace had given her grace shown her grace to do this and in the midst of all this here they come down through these this way and and all of a sudden in the in the midst of all this we know that you know the angels came and it was a light that came to the Shepherd's in the field and all of a sudden and the scripture tells us that was a great heavenly hosted that you know shone around about the Shepherd's and proclaiming and saying to them about the birth of the Savior the the chant that he and they proclaimed the message that that he is born in the City of David as a savior which is Christ the Lord has come to be born this day and they came to see this one the Shepherd's had come to see this one that nobody else Syntel really had any time to deal with or had anything had any consideration of but there was an angel visit to those Shepherds that came and brought the word and and they walked in the light of that message because it lit up you know and it illuminated their vision and their and their thoughts that they had to go see the this Savior and no doubt these men had heard these words and had heard this stuff all of their lives and knew all about this but all of a sudden now here is the the illumination the revelation of this word that people have held onto and many people may have thought that it was just a fable or just some you know feint in you know a well we just keep hearing the brow bars talk about it and then you know all these type things but here it is now they come in and they follow this light and they see this one baby but he's laying in a stable and he's wrapped in swaddling clothes they're probably stank it was probably covered in animal sweat and everything else laying in this nasty little place down here and here is the creator of the world the savior of the world laying before these people you know here you you know here's here's Mary thinking you know you know she had been so yourself felt so alone and all of this and here they here comes these Shepherds tell them you know what the Angels have come and proclaimed this birth and that's the reason we're here to see the Messiah how might you know that would really stir something in your soul that when you when you see these things take place and then all of a sudden these Shepherds come in to see what has taken place you think it's just done something done in the in the in the dark and off to the side and and out of you but you know what God remembered what was taking place and yet he was going to proclaim to the world what took place and at the same time that those Shepherds had come to see Christ being born and come to see this little baby God in flesh laying there they were made job all around the world you know there was the three you know those major eyes had seen it way off in the distance had seen that light one because they were following the word the word had told him that that the the star would be born in Jacob the son of would be born in Jacob and that's the slight became and yet so all these years the manger had been looking for this sign in the sky to take place because they knew that it was going to take place and they kept waiting and all of a sudden in this in this little light shining so far away or whatever but they knew that was the sign that they were looking for and here they are they begin to travel brethren say they walked two years going to see the Sun they walked under that height and he said there were many observatories and different ones wise men that had been other places and they walked right past them in total we're going to go see the Christ the word is being fulfilled and we walking in the light we're walking in this light one because we've seen it in the sky and they began to walk in that light many people though you're crazy and they didn't people stand there looking I don't see nothing I don't see nothing you've got wise men great sages standing there looking in the sky I don't see nothing I don't see nothing but you know what they weren't cold to be the ones to see the light but the ones that weren't cold to see the like they were the ones that were looking and they were the ones that were sad shown the light and they began to travel to that light and they traveled for two years to come see this child and they brought gifts to him the gold the frankincense the myrrh that identified him and who he was and what he would do on the earth deity dedicated for death that he was going to become and fulfill the scripture that he would die to save man from his sin why because he was to be the seed that was going to bruise the Serpent's head that he was going to be the woman see that was prophesied in the scripture also many years before thousands of years before and yet here he was standing in flesh and here was that great light and so many people had heard the same word had heard the same word and you know what it didn't mean anything to him they hadn't seen anything even though people had had looked and looked in the same skies but you know what they hadn't been called to that to see that same light that was shining the dose that those men that came those wise men had come brother brems says he said this is there's a man here that can turn on the light he said it was the angels of God that showed light upon the hill to guide the Shepherd's to the eternal light see it comes by like life can only come by light he said the Shepherd's wanting to know you know when a king is born they have singing great carrying on when the king is born and he was seeing he was so secretly born and he was born in a stable in a manger with the cattle and horses were eating yet he was the king and the angels came down and sang the hymns to the shepherds in the light of the Angels themselves were like to show with the Word of God they had the Word of God and told them today in the City of David and Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior the angel had the word and the word came by like to God and they followed the word of the Angels to eternal life they found the babe there wrapped in swaddling cloth as they had said for you see life only comes by light and he was the word made light or become light the word in that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets that old had spoke of him and he and here he come and vindicated he was the light of God spoken word see all the prophets had had had been fulfilled in him see the prophets back there with the word like God up at the beginning when he said let there be light and light came and now the Prophet said a virgin shall conceive bring forth the son they called his name Emmanuel for it'll be God with us now when they had spoke it the word had went out but he was the light and what was he the fulfillment hallelujah he was the fulfillment of that word he was a manifestation of that word so it is today God's Word has been fulfilled at the hour that's the light it's God manifesting himself he was the light of the world so he was the light that became that shine that fulfilled the word and you know here they hear these Shepherds had come to see the word had been fulfilled I no doubt though that was a remarkable experience that Mary had went through and you know so many people that still disbelieve Mary's word and still didn't believe that that they had taken place but you know God never leaves what has the never the word without a witness he has witnesses in the earth and you know it is and it's so amazing that even even when people tried to deny the word and yet Harry ours bringing in more and more witnesses to the same thing because here comes the shepherds but then you know though the wise men came but you know there was a there was a time after after he was born and and the scripture tells us that that Mary and Joseph took Jesus to fulfill the law that had to be circumcised and to fulfill all the scripture and you know here he was in the midst of all that and here this little humble girl bringing this baby and that people gave her a bad name and still made fun of her and and ridiculed for her and she was standing in the temple that day but you know they had heard simians word all those years that he said the Lord has spoke to me and he said I'll not die till I see the Lord's Christ and you know they said well the man man's mind must be sleeping but you know and they go well you know he's just he's just a good old man he's been here forever in a day and you know you know he's got one foot banana peeling one in the grave and you know but all of a sudden you know Simeon no matter how old he had gotten or anything like it he knew what the word had been given to him was and how the word had come to him and it was something that was stirring inside of him that he knew that he was going to see the fulfillment of God's Word and you know what he walked into that temple that day and you know what he said to my brother I said you know maybe he saw the same light that John saw worth as he was leading in and all those women had come bringing their babies to fulfill the law that day and they were standing in a line but you know he came walking through there because he was being led by the spirit and he he came through that line and God told told Simeon to stop and there it was and he took he took the baby from Mary and he said Lord let your servant depart in peace for I have seen the salvation because he had seen what had taken place Luke 22:27 says then he came by the spirit into the temple and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him as the custom of the law then he took him up out of it in his arms and blessed him and said Lord now lettest thou thy department of servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel and she's Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto his mother Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against so here he was he came in to speak and yet God you know you sometimes you feel like you're all alone just like Mary you know you feel like you're so alone that you're walking this way all by yourself but you know what God is vindicating his word through the mouths of two or three witnesses and here they are you know after they heard all these things and they had heard the claim that Mary had made before and they ridiculed Mary and here they heard Simeon making this same claim all these years standing in the temple and he came in there and He fulfilled and he matched up exactly what Mary had said and then all of a sudden that we know that Anna the blind Providence began to speak of this one then give God praise for what had taken place because she spoke of the same thing that this was the Messiah that had come to fulfill the scripture here what here's the salvation of Israel here is the light to the Gentiles the scripture tells us see here is the light to the world here he is he's lighting the way and yet people were so blind so walking in darkness because they had walked in a denominational darkness all those years that they had failed to see the truth of God's Word but those that had you know here's Anna she's a blind woman but she had the vision she had real spiritual insight to see what God was doing as they say there's none so blind as hey you will not see because you know many of them they just heard those things and said did you hear what happened at the temple today that little girl came in there you know the one and a Simeon you know the blessed old priest that's been in there forever and a day then lost his mind it was just you know there's so many people to call I can't believe that happened in here could you please Angela we need to get him out of the temple he's starting to lose his mind it's starting to look bad in there and not realizing that was the fulfillment of God's Word and people's a you know because people don't see because they you know it's so they're so dark they walk in darkness they don't see and God is trying to spread the light Matthew 4:16 says the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which set in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and John 8:12 says then Jesus again spake speak again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life so you know he had walked all those years and had all those things said about him and his mother had had to deal with all of those things but you know he kept going but you know there was a day that came when all of a sudden there was this crazy man come out of the woods his dad was a priest and he had a good name and it soon went off be a hermit in the woods the crazy man out there and he come walking out of the woods and this crazy fellows over here met up with this other crazy fellow doubt in the woods in the water down there and he tried to drown him what happened and not realizing that was fulfilling the word why because the Prophet had to come and watch the sacrifice to fulfill the scripture but they didn't see that even when John come out of the woods and told him to repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand it's like who was this guy you see how he looks he needs he needs I needs a haircut and a bath wearing wearing these you know camel cloth and you know eating grubs and stuff out of the woods and grasshoppers and stuff you know he's not he's not any any good sensible person it's he any kind of person that you want to listen to but you know what he was the prophet of God identifying the Lamb of God identifying the word well because he saw the light shining that the stud over Jesus that he knew that was the one he said behold the lamb of God that take away the sin of the world but nobody else saw that slow to coax down there in the water it's like y'all need to get yelling in the movies folks alone you know they're messing up the sensible people around here giving her everything a bad name we don't we don't need people like that around here did you know he began to expound the word and all these things can you imagine all these people had heard all these things and seen these things and then and you know even when he began to expound the word and do miracles you know what they still didn't believe who he was you're a soothsayer you're Beelzebub you have a devil it all started back there when your mama was a prostitute it all started back there and your cousin like they're living in the woods look like artists he bats come walking out they can say you know who being a prophet and it's the same you know and all the things you think of all this was just a big conglomeration and not even realizing it was the fulfillment of the scripture people had it all screwed up where it was all messed up they just couldn't believe what was taking place and here it is it was the fulfillment of God's Word all the way through his life opening up and identifying himself speaking of a glare see people who walked in a glare of days going by as the Pharisees told Jesus we have Abraham as our Father we know what Moses said and we believe what Moses said and we know what Moses said he's like well if you knew if you Abraham was your father you'd know who I was and if you believed Moses you'd believe me but you're not of your father Abraham you're of your father the devil you don't know who you are your standard because if you knew the day an hour which you'd live you'd rejoice to see this because Moses rejoiced to see this day rejoice Moses was looking forward to this day spoke of this day and you've missed it well because you're walking in a glare and in in darkness and you know when you eat brother I said you're looking in a mirage you know if you know what I'm as a mirage is you know when mirages an optical illusion that takes place and what it is is when your where your line of sight is your sight line do you think when the ground below your light of sight is warmer than the air above it so when you see the ground when you're looking out across the interstate or off across the desert or something when you you know you see that light when you're looking out the ground below your line of sight is all warm and hot and you can see the gas and the steam coming up and above that is cool so it causes because of the way the light is being refracted there you're seeing something there that doesn't exist he said he said you see a mirage and you know and you see this a way off in the distance and he said you know people are trying to chase after a mirage and he said you know they're chasing after a denominational Mirage they see something in the distance that's not even there and you know all this time he's trying to examine and tell them what's truth but they miss them because they're looking at a mirage but you know the problem with a mirage you know you know the two things that are required to fix a mirage you know you know the two things that are needed to have one you know what your causes are distance and height one because if you're if you're up close to one you don't see one but what is it you look off way off in the distance and you can see one and yeah and you're too far down if you had a higher elevation you could see out there realize there's nothing there but if you're off in the distance and you can see way out and you and you're down low and look out across there you know you see all kinds of things and you know when it's hot you see one in this and they call that an inferior Mirage and then if it's cold if it's opposite then you see when they call out a superior Mirage and you know people can see a lot of things and people wonder they see you know there's many people that have claimed to see castles and all kinds of things and bodies of water and you know all these great things that they've seen in their life and they go out there and you know there's nothing there but you know here they are chasing these great things that they see in the distance and they run and run and run and they chase after them and they pursue them and they get out there and there's nothing there but you God wants to bring you closer to him if you come unto me then you can see that you know what is truth because he wants because he's and he's Navi he's not he's not wanting you to be very far off he's trying to come to you because he came to seek answer to save those out which were lost so he came to find those that worry that were in darkness there were off in a distance but he came to bring them closer to him one because then then you can have sight to see but you can't see afar off because you're not designed to see that but you know if you if you come to him that he can give you the sight he can give you the vision to see what needs to be seen and people have looked away off and they and they see great things and they chase after things and didn't realize they're not even there if even people have chased great denominational things and many things that the devil has brought out to people and tried to to put up things and tried to blind people's eyes and he's tried to create these great mirages and these great glares of things and you know people as brother branham said people spend all their time and they're looking back at something that happened in the past and they don't even see what's taking place in front of them what God is doing today thinking like they give God glory for what he done in the past and what he's going to do but they don't realize what God is doing right now well because they're standing in the glare of another age they're standing in the glare of a denominational idea or something Satan has propped up before them and they don't even realize what's taking place today they don't see what God is doing that's the reason their brother Brent he's sitting in God is his own interpreter and he was talking about you know looking through the scripture he said people are looking back it and Luther's dad what a great day Luther's what day was in Wesley's day and Pentecost was what a great day Pentecost was and what a great day that the Prophet when the Prophet was here but the thing is that they're looking back he said but they're not searching the scripture he said because he what Luther had a great day but Luther had to search the scripture for his day there was a day Luther had desert to search the scripture in his day when he found the scripture that was spoken for his day the just shall live by faith then he could turn the world upside down why because that was the set the Lord for his day and Wesley could take the word of sanctification and bring it forth and preach the word and show the people we got to come to a sanctified condition a sanctified life here the Pentecostal this is the great day of the Pentecostal age and they're speaking in tongues and all the great gifts and all these things and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know here we come all these great things but you know what they didn't do away with everything they didn't finish God's plan but they keep looking back what God done way back then and then you know Malachi 4 we were we were promised a prophet in our day we were probable promised prophesied a messenger in our day a prophet that would come and bring the opening of the word God would come in human flesh again and stand and speak to us we people looking back what a great day that was what a great day that was but you know what that's not the day that we live in God sent a prophet yes and we can all praise God but why did the Prophet tell us why did the God when did the god of brother Branham speak to us why did he call us to he called us to a greater light you know he didn't just call us to be born again and that's the great thing and we need to that and we need to get people to that but that's not the end of it well because you know people will live in a mirage and you they get to this place where you know you know well you know I've got the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost well you know what if the Holy Ghost is inside of you then why's the Holy Ghost because the scripture says that he will lead you and guide you into all truth then why is he not leading you and guiding you into all truth well is it is it the way that we've come to this place that we've ruled that people are born again and they sit there and then they just will do it well this is important I'm going or maybe they hadn't even got that far yet why are they living in a glare of another age and they think they're sealed in and they're not even don't even realize that they're sealed out there not in they just they're just walking through in there and they're just going through the motions and not realizing what God has called them to and if he's called us to this then you know he called us to a to a statue of a perfect man not an only just to be born again but but to be mean to the image of Jesus Christ well what did the word do and time brought us Jesus Christ none not even brother Branham you know you know because you know we just gonna walk along and you know but we you know we know that God comes he was Malachi for he felt all of the scriptures that was that was God in human flesh well praise the Lord I believe that but you know what hey he spoke to us that you know what God wants to be the same as he was back then in the same and every part of his bride well because she is supposed to be the Living Word made manifest and everybody looks back at brother Branham oh what a great man we had in our day why because the devil has blinded to people's eyes to the fact what is it going to take for you to get there it takes you've got to have a experience for yourself you've got to have a relationship for yourself you've got to come to that realization for yourself know people people have come along and you know we've got people that nowadays you know will praise the Lord I'm just going to push play well you know what then we just take the scripture and like well you know what that part of the scripture we don't want we just we just gonna throw that out and then you've got other people that come along and it's like can you believe them people they don't believe in a fivefold ministry and then you got everybody else you know well we're just going we just don't get behind it we just gonna get behind our pastor and you know what our pastor is gonna take us in we got a brother son so he's my pastor like that gets you into heaven it's my pastor that's where I go to church like I'd does something for you that gonna get you anywhere no because if you don't walk in all the light as he is in the light that's ready they said you gotta walk in the light as he is in the light because you know yep I believe in listening to tapes and I believe in reading but you know what you've got to have an experience for yourself you've got to have you got to know Jesus Christ for yourself brother Branham couldn't give it to you brother Dale can't give it to you there's nobody can give it to you you've got to know Jesus Christ for yourself you've got to come to a place where you know that you know that you know and if we turn down any part of the word then you know what we're not walking in the light as he is in the light then we're walking in the darkness and he said he said if you're I had walked in darkness he said how great is that darkness if you if your eyes not single on the word we've got to have a fivefold ministry but if fivefold ministry is not going to take you in because everybody's like well you know you've got this one camp over here and you got this one camp over here well the thing is you've got it you've got to know Jesus Christ for yourself but you've got you've got understand yes we've got to have the message and the message came and you know what it's in the in the books and the tapes and those sermons brother Branham laid it out for us but the thing is is he takes a fivefold ministry to dig in there and pull these things out for us to see these things you know you know I feel sorry for a lot of people because they live and they live in this glare of another age or they live in this glare that the devil is has brought up and they said before and they think they're OK and then you know and then I want to try to to judge each other and put point fingers at people and don't even realise you know what they got three more pointed back at them how what kind of condition that people are living in and not realizing the day and the hour which we live it's a it's a time that because when the bridegroom when when the voice that came and spoke and he said he said toad to rise and trimmed their lamps the Virgin's had to rise and trim their lamps and they realized they were without all that's the time in which we live it's you and I've got to be prepared we've got to trim our own lamps make sure that we have all we ain't got time to go around pointing fingers at everybody too many people are got you know they're all into everybody else's business and it's a sad time because people don't realize the late hour in which we live that we have to be ready for ourselves you know you're not going you're not going to do anybody any favors people think that you know what you know I'm just going to get up and I'm just gonna tell these people off you know I just come to tell you and I'm gonna set you straight and you know what you know what needs to be done you know what you know what people need you know what we need in this hour we need people that can live the life of Jesus Christ brother Branham said brother Brown said we don't need people preaching it he said we need people living it that's one of the things he said about brother Neville what he told my brother Neville he said the one thing about her brother Neville preached the message he preached the word but he said he lived it he said that's one thing he said he said live it he said live me a sermon he said don't preach me a sermon and everybody wants to point their fingers and lay it out for everybody and tell everybody how to straighten up and do all their what's right what's not you know what if we all got in our prayer clothes and so we prayed through and we got to the place that we live the life and we well you know before we got up and we wanted to point out everybody's faults and failures and everything you know if we spend more time in the prayer closet for ourselves and for our brothers and praying for them and trying to get them to the place where they need to be then you know I would be so much better because you know what if you live the life before somebody somebody can see it they can't argue with that just like when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and he said it meet with them and they were all gathered in there you know what they may not have believed in Jesus and they may not like Jesus but the one thing they couldn't do was the life that was living he had raised Lazarus from the dead and they couldn't argue with that they could argue with a lot of things but you know you can't argue what the life lived they may not agree with you they may not like it but does one think about it if they see Jesus Christ on the scene they can't argue with that you know that's a that's what we need in this out we need more people living the life of Jesus Christ reflecting the like making the light manifest in this hour because I don't I don't have time to argue with people I don't have time to fuss for people you know because what what is it what good does it do if you want to if you want to be a blessing to somebody walk in the light walk in the light as he is in the light then people God can see God can use your life to see to see Christ made manifest this is from the message there's a man here that can turn on the light musicians can come a sizzle he said let there be light and there was like yes sir he said let there be light and there was there is light he spoke there would be light in this day and there is light he is coming I believe it look at the promises of this age every like that's ever shined these church ages we see has been a pitiful sight to see rejecting revelation three I've got wrote down here revelation three when I was referred looked to the promise of this hour what we're living in a rejected light what did they they rejected it back there while they was living in a glare what are they doing today same thing he said well are you a Christian I'm a Lutheran I'm a Baptist I'm a Presbyterian he said they don't mean one thing just might as well say it was a hog pig or anything else you want to call yourself see that that's that's just about how much it means now no disregards to you but if you're told taking it to its fundamental part that's right I asked the question a Christian that's Christ in you and if Christ is in you then the word is in you then if the word is in you then the light is shining how you walk going to walk out of it see that's the question that's what is in Nell the light the evening lights are shining the broad tree is blooming so the light is shining if the light is if we are in the light as he is in the light then we are the light of the world we are the light to be shining people have their own ideas and they're living in that glare but you know we are to shine the light forth to be the light of the hour to show the truth and you know what if we if we get to the place and and and you know sometimes people will you people get upset and you know we just want to raise off and say something to somebody but you know if we have temperance and patience if we're bringing God's bringing us up through there you know we then we know how to deal with our brothers when they come along and you know we don't snap back at somebody but we know what our brother is going through and you know we get to the place that you know Lord let me be salty and Lord allow me to be the one to say the right thing because you know sometimes people say well you know what I'm gonna tell them off that's like well you know what maybe we need to pray about it you know when when they revile Ronald on Jesus everything you know he didn't roll back at it and maybe that's what we need to do prepare ourselves that lord let us be like to them Lord let us help them Cory if we can say something just somebody let us be a light in this hour to the people that need that need this light people are walking in a glare but you know what when you walk in a glare of a and you see this Mirage or whatever we need the true light to shine and Lord let us be that light that shines to the people that they can see the hour in which we live to see what's truth because you know what as long as they're still here you know we're gonna go after we're just gonna be like Abraham and we're gonna go after them they might be walking in darkness they be walking in false doctrine and a lot of people that have walked away and said things and people you know what I want to pray you know and and maybe they have turned down their day of grace I don't know but you know what I want to be I want to be in a place that if I can say something to somebody I want to be I want to say it in the love and I want to say it in truth I want to be a word fitly spoken to them that I can help somebody I just don't want to offend somebody and Miss a Miss opportunity to speak to somebody Amen god bless you know let's stand send the light amen let's be that light to the world God's called us to that he came to be the light to the world in darkness and he's called us to be the same things like right in this hour Satan is running a rampage doing having so much confusion economically governmental he can eat ecumenical everything just running rampant but you know what he called us to be liked to be to be soldiers in this hour to be to be like be a messenger of the light to show Jesus Christ in this day comes ringing or the restless way send the light sand the light there are souls to rescue there are souls to save sin the line similar send the line the Blessed gospel I let it shine from shoulders your sand the line but it's rainy and means

line sin the line where the scanner fuels for a crown of laughs in the line say in the line sit in the don't let's say gospel the line straining bees you know lots of times people sing that song and they're there when they sing that song they sing send the line send the line they don't realize it's in the light it required us to send the light it's us so brother wait has something to say some let him come just remember I'm gonna put a prayer cloth up here and heard a wonderful message tonight I want everybody to we're gonna pray brother Dutch Scott I'm going to preach for him Sunday he can't hardly make it through a day they're saying he may have Lyme disease and he has paralysis on this side of his face and he has to actually hold his face up to preach and he has to wear a patch on one eye so he's really in dire straits so that's I'm going Sunday to minister for him there one service in Calhoun so that's where I'll be but I won't as we dismiss the service in just a moment I want everybody to come in and while the anointing is here and we got all the anointed people here don't say anything about the ones that not here but reaching reaching say a little prayer for brother Dutch and I'll take that with me to her brother does he he said he can he can cannot work a full day because he gets just drained and has to stop and actually take a nap before he goes back to work against so and brother Dutch is not an old gentleman but he's he's trying to preach too so he was real happy that we were able to to go over there and speak for him and also I want you to pray this coming Sunday we're gonna do just like we've been doing normally except all the brothers can come there we're not gonna send out an email so it's being announced from here that the men can just come at your

community let's see how the world is and me and brother Dale will talk about it and we might maybe do a half they may maybe let the women come in and let them do the servicing yeah no that don't work that won't work but do something for the mother so just pray that we we may do something and get the sisters or at least a mother's in and and let them sit in the service and I just think this thing's fixing to fix him to be alright and and we'll get back to some kind of normalcy but just keep us on your prayers keep Brett likes to keep the brother does he really he's never down but he was really down yesterday because he can't do he can't work and he can't pastor because he can't you know somebody preaching and have to hold her hold it you know how you do when you go to the doctor and you get novocaine and you can't talk and all that stuff you know involuntarily starts flowing out of your mouth he said it he has to hold his mouth up to preach so let's just pray for him pray for the people of their teeth and but what I'll turn it back over to you and you can you can pray and as everybody leaves just touch it and head on out the door and then we'll be careful going home because it's
