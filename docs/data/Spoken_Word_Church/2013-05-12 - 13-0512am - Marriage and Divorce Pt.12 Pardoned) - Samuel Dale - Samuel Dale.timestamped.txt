[6:05] from new jersey there
[6:06] the lord just have your way we love you
[6:08] and we thank you
[6:10] keep us in jesus name
[6:12] amen
[6:13] let's read our scripture we've been
[6:15] reading in matthew
[6:17] 19
[6:19] and then we'll go into romans 8.
[6:23] the pharisees came unto him tempting him
[6:26] and saying unto him
[6:28] and remember they wouldn't want
[6:30] to be right or whatever they were
[6:32] tempting him
[6:34] all right so is it lawful for a man to
[6:36] put away his wife for every cause in
[6:39] other words for just anything
[6:41] he answered and said unto them have you
[6:44] not read
[6:45] that he which made them at the beginning
[6:47] made them male and female
[6:49] and said for this call shall a man leave
[6:51] father and mother and shall cleave to
[6:53] his wife and they twain shall be one
[6:55] flesh
[6:56] wherefore there are no more twain but
[6:58] one flesh what god therefore had joined
[7:00] together let not man put asunder so that
[7:03] was his answer
[7:05] can you do it for just any cause he says
[7:07] no
[7:08] it wasn't so in the beginning all right
[7:10] verse 7 they say unto him
[7:13] why did moses then command to give a
[7:16] writing a divorcement
[7:17] and to put her away
[7:20] he saith unto them moses because of the
[7:22] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[7:23] put away your wives but from the
[7:25] beginning it was not so
[7:27] and i say unto you now listen whosoever
[7:30] shall put away his wife except it be for
[7:32] fornication and shall marry another
[7:34] committeth adultery
[7:36] and whosoever marrieth her that is put
[7:38] away doth commit adultery all right
[7:41] let's go over to
[7:43] romans now
[7:45] 8.
[7:48] we begin reading with verse
[7:51] 28
[7:54] and we know that all things work
[7:56] together for good to them
[7:59] that love god
[8:01] to whom are the called according to his
[8:03] purpose
[8:04] for whom he did for no he also did
[8:06] predestinate
[8:08] to be conformed see to be conformed
[8:11] something coming later on or it would
[8:13] have said predestinated them and they're
[8:15] already see it's pointing forward
[8:18] to the image of his son that he might be
[8:21] the firstborn among many brethren
[8:23] or over whom he did predestinate them he
[8:25] also called and whom he called thee then
[8:28] he also justified and whom he justified
[8:30] them he also glorified
[8:32] what shall
[8:33] we then say to these things
[8:36] if god has done all of this what can you
[8:38] and i say
[8:41] if god be for us
[8:43] who can be against us he that spared not
[8:45] his own son but delivered him up for us
[8:47] all
[8:48] how shall he not with him also freely
[8:50] give us all things
[8:52] who shall lay anything to the charge
[8:55] of god's elect
[8:57] it is god that justifieth
[9:01] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[9:03] that died yet rather that is risen again
[9:06] who is even at the right hand of god who
[9:08] also maketh intercession for us you may
[9:11] be seated the lord at his blessing
[9:14] to the reading of the word
[9:16] now i want you to
[9:20] thank with me today and to make sure
[9:22] this one point thoughts in your mind
[9:26] the bible is positive
[9:29] in what it says
[9:32] no
[9:32] it's not negative it's not
[9:35] uh you know
[9:37] halfway
[9:41] it's perfect
[9:43] but you and i must accept it that way
[9:46] you know
[9:48] let's have a brother back here with us
[9:50] he's been here before he's ain't no
[9:51] visitor though he's a long way from home
[9:53] he ain't no visitor
[9:56] but
[9:58] see that to me is the one thing that all
[10:01] christians should remember
[10:04] when god says something
[10:07] he cannot back up
[10:11] now if he says it about his curses or
[10:13] whatever you know if he condemns
[10:15] then he condemns
[10:17] all right
[10:18] but then if he sets free then he sets
[10:21] free
[10:23] and the bible said he that the son has
[10:25] set free
[10:27] is free indeed
[10:29] that word indeed means there's no
[10:30] limitation whatsoever placed upon that
[10:33] or it wouldn't be called it indeed it'd
[10:35] say in part
[10:37] all right so then that way we can look
[10:40] at the word and be sure
[10:42] when we read it but the main thing of
[10:44] today is for me to get over to you one
[10:46] point
[10:48] if we can't believe
[10:51] what god has said to be true
[10:55] about us
[10:58] then it's not for us
[11:00] is that
[11:01] plain enough
[11:03] you know
[11:04] i mean if i stood up here and i said i
[11:05] got a million dollars up here for one
[11:07] person in the building that wouldn't be
[11:08] everybody in the building would it
[11:13] we've got to believe
[11:15] all right how did the prophet say it
[11:18] he said
[11:20] we've got to believe that there's
[11:22] there's only one
[11:24] going to make the rapture
[11:27] we've got to believe we're that one
[11:30] we can't just say well i i believe i'm
[11:32] gonna i think i might make it but i
[11:33] believe my pastor will
[11:35] well now
[11:36] your pastor might be totally lost
[11:39] he might not be even in the story
[11:41] whatsoever
[11:43] well i don't believe it that way well i
[11:44] don't either but
[11:46] i'm just straight and honest if we can't
[11:49] believe we're the only one you know if
[11:50] there is only one going and we can't
[11:52] believe we're that one
[11:54] see then we're not believing correctly
[11:56] we're only taking it on the basis of a
[11:59] of an understanding from somebody else a
[12:01] thought or an idea
[12:04] or even reading the bible of what
[12:05] somebody says
[12:07] see it's got to be personal
[12:09] all right if we get nothing you get
[12:11] nothing now the message today you get
[12:13] that part
[12:14] that what we're trying to do
[12:17] and what we're trying to speak on
[12:19] now i will not back up too much because
[12:22] the tapes are there if you want to hear
[12:24] them
[12:24] but this is message number 12. that
[12:27] we've been speaking on marriage and
[12:29] divorce
[12:30] in other words covering what a marriage
[12:33] is what a wedding marriages and things
[12:35] like that
[12:36] and then on the divorce situation of who
[12:39] can divorce for what reasons or whatever
[12:42] and we've been through that covering it
[12:45] and i will not back up other than make
[12:46] the statements
[12:48] uh
[12:49] jesus made it
[12:50] plain
[12:52] the only divorce could be made for a man
[12:55] was what
[12:57] that his wife was committed fornication
[12:59] adultery is the same word
[13:01] interchangeable
[13:02] all right fornication is technically a
[13:04] before marriage uh you know before
[13:07] becoming
[13:09] engaged because that's what we've
[13:11] covered what is a wedding an engagement
[13:13] when you ask a girl to marry you and she
[13:15] accepts you're married
[13:18] now
[13:19] we went through that brother and said
[13:21] it's not the preacher that marries you
[13:23] it's your vow
[13:24] you go to some of these foreign
[13:26] countries and they just talk to each
[13:27] other about getting married they come
[13:28] back later and lay down maybe a half a
[13:30] dozen cows or a couple of goats or
[13:32] something
[13:33] which we don't do that in america but
[13:36] i didn't have one daughter so
[13:38] that would have been all right i'd had
[13:39] to pay double for the other but for them
[13:41] see they just do and they just walk up
[13:44] and they don't necessarily have a
[13:45] preacher
[13:46] or whatever they just have a house and
[13:49] step over a stick and and they're just
[13:51] as married as anybody that went through
[13:53] a long lengthy ceremony why because
[13:56] you're married by your vows the bible
[13:58] says by your word shall be justified
[14:01] by your words you'll be condemned
[14:04] all right see then if we expect god to
[14:06] keep his word
[14:09] and we do don't we
[14:11] well he expects us to keep our word
[14:14] all right see then that that way it
[14:16] should be a settled fact to what we're
[14:18] doing when we see the man is not for
[14:20] just any cause
[14:22] he read that in the script jesus makes
[14:24] it plain
[14:25] he said there was not that for any cause
[14:27] because in the beginning it was just one
[14:29] man one woman
[14:31] and the prophet said in the end it'll
[14:32] wind up being that away because we're in
[14:34] the antetype
[14:36] we're not in typing
[14:38] we're in the antitype which means a
[14:40] fulfillment
[14:41] and see when jesus christ come and paid
[14:43] the price polygamists and things ended
[14:46] with the old testament form of doings
[14:49] and and as it did then you come into the
[14:51] new testament and you got one man one
[14:53] woman it's not to be you know one man a
[14:55] half dozen women or one woman the way it
[14:57] is today and i have a dozen men or
[14:58] something it's just getting all
[15:00] perverted
[15:01] but see we're we're talking about bible
[15:02] terminologies we're not talking about
[15:04] man and his ideas or what you think
[15:06] about it or what i think about it i
[15:08] don't give a hoot what you think but
[15:10] this word says and what it says that's
[15:12] what i'm going to say
[15:14] because it says then the man can only
[15:16] put away his wife for
[15:17] fornication i use the word adultery in
[15:19] there because the word adultery and
[15:21] fornication is the same word
[15:24] but then the bible says fear not to take
[15:26] told joseph fear not to take unto thee
[15:28] mary thy wife they were only a spouse
[15:30] right
[15:31] engaged
[15:33] the old testament if you as a spouse
[15:35] even under the law of polygamy i gave
[15:37] where the prophet covered it even under
[15:39] the law of polygamy under the old
[15:41] testament the prophet said if that boy
[15:43] asks that girl to marry him he
[15:45] doesn't keep his word and jumps over and
[15:47] marry somebody else he said he's
[15:49] committing adultery
[15:51] and said he's put out of the camp now
[15:53] that was his words
[15:54] because that's how strong it is it's
[15:56] just not a play party that the man is
[15:57] the hooty dude good guy you know he can
[15:59] do anything he wants to and get by but
[16:01] the girl can't
[16:02] no
[16:03] no it's plain about him
[16:05] so then you understand what i'm trying
[16:07] to say but now for the woman there is no
[16:09] grounds for a divorcement
[16:11] why because she was the one that brought
[16:13] the cause of the fall
[16:16] there's no ground her husband according
[16:17] to romans 7 will get to it this evening
[16:20] more her husband must be dead right
[16:24] see you can't you can't have two living
[16:26] husbands and be right
[16:28] all right see that was what the problem
[16:29] was the problem in the garden wasn't
[16:31] adam and a bunch of women because nobody
[16:33] there but eve
[16:35] but it was eve and adam plus the
[16:38] beast
[16:40] which was not a snake
[16:42] and it wasn't a hurry monkey
[16:44] it was what darwin couldn't find his
[16:46] missing link
[16:48] i mean it was one that could cross and
[16:50] the monkeys won't cross into the human
[16:52] race the beast was taken the bible says
[16:54] the serpent was the the beast was the
[16:56] most
[16:58] subtle serpent
[17:00] see went to the ground crawling on his
[17:01] belly from then on because of the fault
[17:03] all right just a few words to get a
[17:05] point to what we're talking about
[17:07] but we saw then
[17:08] man down through time then
[17:11] that every time you get together and you
[17:13] talk to people on religious matters
[17:15] the fact of marriage and divorce comes
[17:17] up just like we use darkness jesus see
[17:20] when it comes up the people want to talk
[17:22] about it
[17:24] you say but but brother dale that's just
[17:26] too hard we can't live according to that
[17:28] i'll agree with you
[17:30] i agree with you we can't we didn't
[17:34] so then it would be up to god to have to
[17:36] make a way
[17:39] it'd be up to him to have to make a way
[17:40] for us
[17:42] and he did
[17:44] but the way has to be made perfect now
[17:46] we'll get to that in a minute and it has
[17:47] to be lined up correctly all right
[17:50] we wound up speaking a couple of
[17:51] messages or have about three messages
[17:54] talking about the grace
[17:56] to be given
[17:57] about these marital situations that we
[18:00] have
[18:01] and it follows right through the
[18:02] scriptures and the things and we will
[18:04] review a little more this afternoon
[18:06] of just like rahab the harlot
[18:08] coming and marrying
[18:10] into an israeli general and from there
[18:13] came the lineage right down to boaz from
[18:15] boaz down to jesse and on down to david
[18:18] and all of the things and see god has
[18:21] made a way before
[18:22] on a lot of situations
[18:25] but we've got to go at it according to
[18:26] the scriptures we can't go at it because
[18:29] we believe it it's like i said the
[18:31] prophet of god stood there said in 64.
[18:34] he said i've got the scriptures on
[18:37] marriage and divorce
[18:40] he said but if i preach it it'll bust
[18:41] every church in the world
[18:45] and see he couldn't just because he knew
[18:48] that moses had given a grace
[18:51] and he knew paul had given the grace and
[18:54] he believed they would be one in the end
[18:55] time but you can't just walk out and say
[18:58] this is it unless you got something to
[18:59] put it on
[19:02] you could say well the end time was to
[19:04] get a message amen
[19:07] but if you and i don't believe that
[19:08] message don't believe that message is
[19:11] personal
[19:12] that's why i like that scripture it says
[19:14] behold i send you
[19:16] it didn't say everybody it said behold i
[19:18] send you elijah
[19:20] i'm that one that it was sent for amen
[19:23] that's the way i'm believing it i'm the
[19:24] only one in the building saved right
[19:27] right as far as i know
[19:29] that's right
[19:31] the rest of you got to sit there and say
[19:33] well he missed that because i'm the only
[19:35] one
[19:36] all right that's fine because we've got
[19:39] to make it personal that's the thing we
[19:41] got to do is keep everything lined up
[19:43] and make it something personal to us
[19:47] all right
[19:48] but see i preached the last message
[19:50] there a couple of them on trying to
[19:52] bring out some points of understanding
[19:55] that
[19:56] see grace has to be revealed
[20:00] all right the prophet of god said on
[20:02] marriage and divorce progress 272
[20:05] that this grace had to be revealed
[20:09] all right it's not that you were even
[20:10] sitting there
[20:12] you could have been sitting there
[20:13] yourself
[20:15] you and your wife and all the problems
[20:16] yeah and then go back home in the same
[20:19] situation you went if you didn't believe
[20:21] it was revealed
[20:23] if you didn't believe as i said the
[20:25] basis if we don't believe that god sent
[20:27] a prophet in the last days
[20:30] i see the brother shakes his head a
[20:31] little bit so evidently he must be
[20:32] familiar with a little bit what we
[20:34] believe
[20:35] all right so we believe that god sent a
[20:36] prophet
[20:38] we don't believe that man was god no way
[20:42] that's antichrist
[20:44] but we believe that god used a man to
[20:46] bring a message to us all right we
[20:48] believe god is still using man to bring
[20:50] messages to us but it can't be brought
[20:52] contrary to that original one
[20:55] and that one took and turned us right
[20:57] back to the word
[20:59] amen all right now in the message you
[21:01] got people around the country said i'm
[21:02] to take over now well
[21:05] go follow it do what you want to
[21:10] constitution gives you a right to
[21:12] believe what you want to but the bible
[21:13] don't
[21:15] show me that in the bible all right now
[21:18] but getting on with the matter
[21:22] see grace
[21:24] must be revealed
[21:28] now and unless it's revealed
[21:32] you and i cannot stand on it
[21:36] and it's not like i told you and i don't
[21:38] the whole but the brother kind of got
[21:40] away from me one time when i said this
[21:41] is my revelation
[21:44] and he said i don't have a revelation my
[21:46] revelation is that brother branham had
[21:47] the revelation well i thought that
[21:50] sounded like he said the same thing i
[21:51] did
[21:52] you know i wasn't blinded on that part
[21:55] because he said he had a revelation i
[21:56] said i had one all right
[21:58] but the point is he said when the
[22:01] prophet said it that's the revelation
[22:05] now i don't agree with that
[22:08] what he said was already in this bible
[22:12] well then you'd be saying this is the
[22:14] revelation and that's true it is
[22:18] but it must be revealed to you and i am
[22:25] just because it said it doesn't make it
[22:27] right
[22:29] like the prophet always emphasized the
[22:31] bible said in one place
[22:33] judas went and hung himself
[22:35] take another scripture and said you go
[22:37] do likewise now what are you going to do
[22:42] you
[22:44] you got to get it together what it's
[22:45] talking about
[22:47] all right then when you get it together
[22:48] what it's talking about
[22:50] then you can understand now truly we
[22:52] know
[22:54] that these things of the end time was
[22:56] not to be made known down through time
[22:59] because man had taken god's word and so
[23:03] gotten away from the truth of it until
[23:05] when you come into the dark ages of
[23:07] martin luther and them that all god
[23:10] could do was take a man like martin
[23:11] luther which was a trinitarian
[23:14] you know
[23:16] said the jews ought to be taken out and
[23:17] be killed because he was a man he was
[23:20] just under the man time of the combat
[23:22] beast
[23:23] but yet he did preach that just shall
[23:25] live by faith
[23:27] and we believe that
[23:31] john wesley came along preaching
[23:32] sanctification i believe that
[23:38] pentecostals come along preaching the
[23:39] baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts
[23:41] i believe that
[23:43] all right but see it was to come in the
[23:45] end time that this prophet he said
[23:47] wouldn't have no certain mystery
[23:51] but he would gather up all the mysteries
[23:54] of the entire bible well if we believe
[23:56] that's happened then we're here in the
[23:58] end time to be able to stand upon the
[24:00] word of god
[24:01] and say we've had a message all right
[24:03] now
[24:05] see it must be revealed
[24:07] the whole bible
[24:10] the prophet said on a message called
[24:11] patman's vision paragraph 69
[24:14] the whole bible
[24:16] is a revelation
[24:18] it must be revealed
[24:20] if not we're just saying what somebody
[24:22] else said amen
[24:24] well the bible says this the prophet
[24:26] said eyes free and i believe it well
[24:28] amen if that's revealed to you right if
[24:31] not you're just saying what he's saying
[24:32] that's right
[24:36] if somebody else has got to tell you
[24:40] what you are
[24:42] then where's the personal revelation
[24:43] unto you
[24:45] it's wonderful for helps and things you
[24:47] know to tell us these things right
[24:50] but for me to just come up and say well
[24:52] brother branham said he saw me there
[24:56] all right
[24:58] and people lay on that
[25:00] well you better remember
[25:02] he went to both places
[25:07] and he saw people in the regions of the
[25:09] lost
[25:10] and he saw people in the
[25:13] regions of the blessed so now where did
[25:15] he see you at
[25:18] oh but brother you're just too negative
[25:20] no i'm positive you're the one's
[25:22] negative
[25:24] because you're not believing the word
[25:25] all right but now watch you remember how
[25:27] he's bringing out from patmos vision the
[25:30] prophet of god said you can only be
[25:31] saved by revelation
[25:34] you can't be saved by just intellectual
[25:36] understanding or thoughts or believing
[25:38] this and most of people say i know i'm
[25:41] saved because i believe god sent a
[25:42] prophet
[25:46] well now that's not what the bible says
[25:48] or even what
[25:49] you know the prophet of god said
[25:53] he said the only evidence really that
[25:55] you can link it on is whether or not the
[25:57] spirit in you agrees with the word amen
[26:00] now you could put on everything
[26:02] believing god sent a prophet believing
[26:04] that this was right believing that was
[26:06] right like i say i believe martin luther
[26:09] when he preached to joshua lived by
[26:10] faith that was the bride of jesus christ
[26:13] in that day and that was all that was
[26:15] required
[26:17] so luther wasn't responsible for
[26:20] understanding about the jews and how
[26:21] they would come in and what was to be
[26:23] done he wasn't responsible about being
[26:25] because he was come up through under the
[26:27] trinitarian concept
[26:30] and he was he couldn't be held
[26:31] responsible for that
[26:33] but once truth comes
[26:35] we can't rely upon something that we
[26:37] believed
[26:38] like the prophet said mama might have
[26:40] told you that hell was eternal
[26:43] he said but we found out it's not
[26:45] eternal
[26:48] and see then that way we know that it's
[26:51] the truth will set us free all right
[26:53] so now watch
[26:55] so you can only be saved by revelation
[26:58] everything we get from god according to
[27:00] the scriptures must come by faith
[27:04] we must believe that he is
[27:07] and he is a rewarder of them that
[27:08] diligently seek him right
[27:11] now we don't believe that he was
[27:13] that won't save you
[27:16] come on he died for me but well all
[27:18] right if i didn't come up to where
[27:20] you're at
[27:21] then you're still back there talking
[27:22] about something
[27:23] somebody else said
[27:24] exactly
[27:25] all right
[27:27] what is the antichrist according to the
[27:29] little john's
[27:31] he that confesses that jesus christ is
[27:33] come in the flesh is of god
[27:35] but he that says that he has not come in
[27:36] the flesh is the antichrist
[27:39] what come in your flesh come in you or
[27:41] right now
[27:43] the christ the new birth into our hearts
[27:46] and souls to set us free
[27:48] all right
[27:50] then the prophet of god went on to say
[27:51] it like this
[27:52] he said faith according to the rapture
[27:54] message
[27:56] progress 66
[27:58] faith is a revelation
[28:00] something that's revealed unto you
[28:03] amen
[28:05] now just because it's revealed unto me
[28:07] don't make it revealed unto you
[28:11] i don't care how long you've been
[28:12] sitting here listening
[28:14] you need a revelation amen
[28:18] see that's as blunt as i can make it
[28:20] plain as i can make it but while the any
[28:22] problems with it
[28:24] because i say it don't mean that it's
[28:26] right
[28:28] but when somebody ever regardless if
[28:30] it's a dumb donkey
[28:33] in the bible you remember rebuked a
[28:34] prophet right
[28:37] you see saved his life amen all right
[28:41] but you see church we've got to base it
[28:42] there's got to be something personal to
[28:44] you and i
[28:47] not something we can talk about or or we
[28:49] believe it
[28:51] amen
[28:53] that's why we've been around here nearly
[28:55] 50 years since
[28:56] the death of the prophet
[28:58] what do you think all that's been for
[29:01] well just waiting on other people get
[29:03] lined up because i lined up start with
[29:04] you
[29:06] yeah okay
[29:09] okay
[29:13] but now listen
[29:15] see then whatever it would be whether it
[29:17] be
[29:18] grace for the salvation of the new birth
[29:24] which comes by grace by grace are you
[29:27] saved through faith that not of works
[29:28] lest any man should boast
[29:32] or whether it would be that we would
[29:33] talk about the grace of marriage and
[29:35] divorce that was brought in the last
[29:37] days unto us
[29:40] see that can only be brought unto us by
[29:43] revelation
[29:45] or else we're saying what somebody else
[29:47] said
[29:48] they remember in the scripture no man
[29:50] can call jesus the christ right
[29:52] what except it be by the holy ghost
[29:56] in other words something personal to you
[29:59] or if not you're quoting what somebody
[30:01] else says
[30:03] and no problem will quote what somebody
[30:05] else says right
[30:07] amen i'm glad we've got it i'm glad we
[30:09] got a bible
[30:11] right
[30:13] i mean i thank god for it
[30:15] and i'm glad it was brought down to us
[30:17] from
[30:18] not left in greek in in hebrews and and
[30:22] i mean it was brought down to where we
[30:24] could understand it
[30:26] you know
[30:27] all right
[30:28] and i thank god for that why because
[30:30] this bible is the revelation according
[30:33] to revelations 1 that i preached for
[30:35] what 90-something sermons and we read
[30:37] revelations 1 1-3
[30:41] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[30:45] this bible
[30:46] the prophet's message that we claim to
[30:48] believe
[30:52] not the parts where he would say
[30:54] seven hundred or seven thousand or or
[30:57] you know be off of this or that or the
[30:59] other but the revelation of the word
[31:03] he said this part of this message is
[31:04] human
[31:05] right around made human mistakes that's
[31:08] why he wasn't god
[31:10] you can't find jesus making human
[31:12] mistakes because dumb people today are
[31:13] trying to say he did but that's all
[31:15] right let them stay on with their
[31:16] dumbness
[31:19] but you see we're trying to go on
[31:22] and not rest upon something like that if
[31:24] brother dale are you built on a man
[31:27] according to my bible
[31:30] paul said
[31:33] for you to say only what he said that's
[31:35] right
[31:36] paul said if you say anything
[31:38] contrary to what i say
[31:41] what did he say galatians 1 8 he said
[31:43] let you be accursed
[31:48] you see this can't be something contrary
[31:50] to what paul brought that's right
[31:53] it can't be something contrary to what
[31:54] moses brought come on
[31:57] you ever heard the prophet called moses
[31:59] said the ten commandments came he said
[32:00] the seals came down
[32:02] he could take the seals and put them
[32:03] right back in the old testament with the
[32:05] ten commandments
[32:07] by his help i can do a little of it not
[32:09] all the way through but
[32:11] i used to be able to preach pretty good
[32:12] out of the seals but that's been a long
[32:14] time ago
[32:16] you get over about seal number four or
[32:18] five you're going to find some great
[32:19] revelations of marriage and divorce
[32:21] right
[32:23] you bring in israel that don't even want
[32:25] to be saved right
[32:27] you need to get in the word and study it
[32:28] did not the prophet of god said
[32:31] that marriage and divorce was revealed
[32:33] in the seals is that not true
[32:36] yeah but that was 63. he didn't preach
[32:38] it till 65 that's right because he had
[32:40] to wait as i was saying a moment ago
[32:42] just because he could see moses had it
[32:44] just because he could see paul had it
[32:46] he couldn't walk out there and say i say
[32:48] unto you
[32:49] until god spoke to him personally
[32:52] it had to be a personal revelation look
[32:55] what peter had to say about it one day
[32:57] peter said i've been on the mountain go
[32:59] over in timothy and read it
[33:01] i believe this one is he said i've been
[33:03] on the mountain
[33:07] i was there and saw
[33:09] god come down
[33:12] he said but i have a more sure word of
[33:14] prophecy
[33:16] why because the baptism of the holy
[33:17] ghost came on the day of pentecost and
[33:19] he had something personal
[33:21] right how about you and i
[33:24] all right so let's get into the thought
[33:25] with it now
[33:27] go ahead with number one first peter 1
[33:29] 13 i wanted to start with this scripture
[33:31] because it's a beautiful scripture to me
[33:33] but look what it says
[33:35] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[33:38] be sober and hope to the end for the
[33:41] grace that is to be brought unto you
[33:44] at
[33:45] the revelation of jesus christ
[33:48] i love that then go over the book of
[33:50] revelation i said there was 1 3 i think
[33:52] it is where it says the revelation that
[33:54] god give to jesus to give to john this
[33:57] is the revelation of jesus christ
[34:00] this prophecies we'll get to it this
[34:02] afternoon
[34:04] prophecy
[34:06] a setting an order of scriptures
[34:08] surely we believe that god sent us a
[34:10] prophet to do those things right
[34:12] it's not you and i
[34:15] but what's the problem if i can find
[34:16] where the prophet said it why you want
[34:18] to get mad at me about it
[34:20] you know i've had people to get offended
[34:22] to me because i told them what brother
[34:23] branham said
[34:25] well i didn't say it he did why didn't
[34:26] they get offended at him
[34:29] oh no they're afraid to do that
[34:32] that's all right
[34:37] so truly then
[34:42] that there's to be a grace
[34:45] that is brought unto you and i
[34:48] went
[34:50] at the revelation of jesus christ
[34:54] not at the revelation of who we are
[34:57] that's good
[34:59] that's part of it
[35:02] but it's a revelation of jesus christ
[35:06] now put christ in you the hope of glory
[35:08] as paul said
[35:09] and now you've got it all back together
[35:11] in the right place
[35:13] but it's a personal revelation to you
[35:15] and i
[35:16] that's right
[35:18] not by what somebody's taught us but
[35:20] what god has revealed yes
[35:23] you remember i gave it to her the other
[35:24] day he said the scripture is what it is
[35:26] it's to be
[35:27] first revealed and it's been made
[35:29] manifest
[35:33] god doesn't require the word in in the
[35:35] basis until it's revealed amen
[35:39] right luther could be a trinitarian
[35:42] they went down through the ages teaching
[35:44] the trinity and god went right on saving
[35:46] them
[35:48] but then the bible said he come to a
[35:50] place that he would no longer wink at
[35:51] man's ignorance but would command all
[35:54] man to repent
[35:56] see in other words follow the truth
[35:58] that's right
[35:59] so we're in the end time we have no
[36:00] excuse anymore saying well i don't know
[36:03] and i don't want to get confused that's
[36:05] the big thing of the people of the
[36:07] message right
[36:08] they don't want to get confused i don't
[36:10] want to study those seals i might get
[36:11] confused i don't want to study on
[36:14] marriage and divorce i might get
[36:15] confused no what you're saying is you're
[36:16] already confused you don't want to be
[36:18] right
[36:20] but you don't want me to say it that way
[36:24] you don't want somebody to tell it to
[36:26] you like that you want to sugarcoat it
[36:28] make it sweet and nice
[36:30] i wish i could
[36:32] you know i mean i repent every night and
[36:34] i go home from preaching i repent for
[36:36] being so hard and sarcastic
[36:39] i do that every day because
[36:41] i know what i am but i know how hard it
[36:43] i try to make it that way the prophet
[36:45] said if i make it hard enough you won't
[36:47] think i'm trying to pull something over
[36:48] on you
[36:50] but you just sweet and humble and nice
[36:54] you don't know whether to tell you the
[36:55] truth or not
[36:57] at least you know what i believe
[36:59] how many of you come from the churches
[37:00] where you're at or in or whatever
[37:03] that you know what your pastor even
[37:05] preaches
[37:06] or did preach
[37:09] i've asked people personal questions
[37:11] that came here after we and your wife
[37:12] what did your pastor say about senator i
[37:14] don't know he never taught on it
[37:17] well what did he teach on
[37:19] you know
[37:21] come on all right
[37:24] all right
[37:26] see
[37:27] grace then for salvation of the soul
[37:32] must be accepted
[37:36] no brother dale grace is unmerited favor
[37:41] well that means everybody's saved and
[37:43] you got the devil's idea
[37:48] come on that's right mormon doctrine
[37:52] come on the mormon doctrine i've talked
[37:54] with them i know what it is the mormon
[37:56] doctrine was that the devil wanted to
[37:58] save everybody
[38:00] that's the mormon doctrine go ask him
[38:02] he wanted to save everybody was up in
[38:04] heaven wanted to come to earth and
[38:05] glorify our father and satan wanted to
[38:07] save everybody but jesus come up with a
[38:09] plan to just save so many
[38:11] and god accepted jesus's plan
[38:13] well i'd rather how the devil's that way
[38:15] you could save everybody
[38:17] right
[38:20] but you see we know that ain't true
[38:23] he paid the price for everybody
[38:25] right
[38:26] everybody in the world today has offered
[38:28] salvation seven billion people
[38:31] everybody in the world could be saved
[38:33] today if they do one thing what
[38:35] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[38:36] thou shalt be saved
[38:40] because it's not just for a certain
[38:42] amount of people
[38:44] it's for them that will believe
[38:47] them that will receive it
[38:50] but it's a revelation
[38:53] you remember about abel we talked about
[38:54] the other night
[38:56] it was revealed unto abel that it was
[38:58] blood he had no bible to read he had no
[39:00] prophet's book to quote from
[39:04] he believed it by revelation but you
[39:06] know what
[39:08] cain believed his revelation
[39:10] he got it from somewhere
[39:14] maybe he listened to his mama a little
[39:17] wow
[39:18] come on
[39:20] because he had the point that it was
[39:22] works
[39:23] what did she have
[39:24] come on
[39:26] it's hard to preach because you you know
[39:28] one line try to go
[39:30] all right but now listen
[39:34] the grace of god is extended only to
[39:38] those who believe it
[39:40] we'll get to it in a minute where they
[39:41] declared what
[39:43] that a pardon is only a pardon if
[39:45] accepted as a pardon
[39:47] right that's right remember the man that
[39:49] was going to be shot and he got abraham
[39:51] lincoln the brother and man did and he
[39:53] signed the paper and he said i won't do
[39:54] it they shot him the next day all right
[39:56] well look what were they going to do
[39:57] they had a man killed with the words of
[39:59] abraham lincoln
[40:01] that he was pardoned
[40:02] so the the
[40:06] supreme court had to make a ruling they
[40:08] made a ruling a pardon's not a pardon
[40:09] unless received is one
[40:13] see then salvation is not for everybody
[40:16] because everybody won't receive it
[40:17] that's right
[40:20] and here's the worst problem
[40:22] is the biggest portion of the world
[40:23] today you would have to agree with this
[40:25] statement that the biggest portion of
[40:27] the world is deceived by the preachers
[40:30] into thinking about salvation and what
[40:32] it is would you go along with that
[40:34] not arguing with nobody
[40:36] just being telling it like it is or what
[40:38] i think
[40:40] you say yeah but brother dale they're
[40:41] preachers the bible says that they're as
[40:43] ministers of righteousness but they're
[40:45] satan's angels or ministers
[40:49] he's the one that started the deceiving
[40:50] part all right so then if we come down
[40:53] from the the grace of marriage and
[40:55] divorce
[40:57] we have to believe that has to be
[40:59] revealed
[41:02] and it's not just because you're born
[41:04] again that would make you right in your
[41:06] marriage and divorce situation we've
[41:07] been through that
[41:09] that's what a lot of people are trying
[41:10] to believe that's a good thought but it
[41:12] won't work why'd the prophet have to
[41:13] preach the grace of marriage and divorce
[41:15] if that was true
[41:16] that's right
[41:19] see why did paul have to preach about it
[41:21] if that's true
[41:23] why not just say you're born again it
[41:24] takes care of everything
[41:27] well you sure don't know a lot about the
[41:28] new birth i don't but i've experienced
[41:30] it so i ain't worried about the rest
[41:34] sure when it's all finished and we go
[41:36] out of here
[41:37] it's all based on that because remember
[41:39] i put a whole sermon in that if we don't
[41:41] have the new birth
[41:43] we cannot talk about the grace of
[41:46] marriage and divorce right
[41:49] the new birth is the first thing
[41:52] because we don't have the new birth we
[41:54] are sinners
[41:57] how can a sinner accept the word of god
[41:59] is not to a sinner the word of god is to
[42:02] the bride of jesus christ
[42:04] it only tells the sinner he's lost
[42:09] and see that's by people that's still
[42:11] telling him he's lost because that's who
[42:13] wrote the bible right
[42:15] all right
[42:16] now think about it
[42:19] a pardon
[42:21] go ahead and put up number one
[42:24] let's just take a few things a few
[42:25] quotes then we'll get down to our main
[42:27] point
[42:28] all right this is taken from the message
[42:30] pardon 1963 10 28
[42:33] but we will take one thing that he has
[42:34] given us and that is pardon
[42:37] and i think that's a glorious word to be
[42:39] pardoned
[42:41] because we're all guilty of sin
[42:45] remember the bible said all have sinned
[42:48] and come short of the glory of god is
[42:50] that scripture no not brother dale i was
[42:52] so good
[42:54] what do you don't need a savior
[42:58] jesus christ died in vain as far as
[43:00] you're concerned
[43:01] we've all sinned and come short of the
[43:03] glory of god and god through his son has
[43:04] pardoned us from this guilt of iniquity
[43:07] and sin okay pull up the next one where
[43:09] we'll get the point
[43:10] this is the message behold greater than
[43:12] solomon is here 1963
[43:15] 1962
[43:17] 612.
[43:18] the court the federal court when the man
[43:20] was shot and all the things they had it
[43:22] there where that he actually lincoln
[43:24] signed the papers gave it to a man but
[43:26] it wasn't on this great big beautiful
[43:27] stationary
[43:28] you know so they wound up and shot the
[43:30] man the next morning because he wouldn't
[43:31] go free he wouldn't accept it so the
[43:34] supreme court made a decision or the
[43:35] federal court a pardon is not a pardon
[43:37] unless it is accepted as a pardon so
[43:40] that's the way god's word is
[43:42] right are you listening we just read
[43:44] that a pardon not a part but look that's
[43:46] the way god's word is right
[43:49] that's the way all the word is
[43:51] it's the word of god to all those who
[43:53] will accept it
[43:55] as the word of god if it's not well then
[43:58] it isn't
[44:00] so remember the point i started off
[44:02] talking about
[44:03] we've got to believe it's for us
[44:09] when you're talking about salvation of
[44:10] the soul or salvation of the
[44:13] grace of marriage and divorce or
[44:14] whatever you're talking about
[44:16] you're gonna have to believe it's for
[44:18] you
[44:23] because if you don't believe it's for
[44:24] you what good is it
[44:27] yeah but brother dale i sinned so much
[44:29] i'm glad you thought of that
[44:32] you know cause i wrote these down
[44:33] yesterday let's see if your thoughts are
[44:35] there
[44:37] yeah but what about is there any grace
[44:40] for me
[44:41] well i wrote these down yesterday
[44:44] all right
[44:45] so let's see if god could put it down
[44:47] here yesterday to tell you what your
[44:48] thinking us today
[44:50] not to try discernments and things like
[44:52] that because we don't need those parts
[44:53] we've got the word i believe in
[44:55] discernment i believe in those things
[44:58] because i believe in all the gifts
[45:02] and i believe sometimes god will give
[45:04] people as a preacher sometimes something
[45:05] before you get here
[45:08] right
[45:09] to be able to answer it
[45:12] see church we must accept the pardon of
[45:14] grace
[45:16] for the new birth for the soul
[45:19] and we must also accept the grace of
[45:22] marriage and divorce
[45:24] for the bodies the spirit the things
[45:26] that are left of us
[45:29] it must be accepted or it's no pardon
[45:32] we've got the papers in our hands
[45:35] we've got the bible
[45:38] we've got the prophet's message
[45:40] in our hands but what good is it in our
[45:42] hands is like blood if it's in your hand
[45:44] on your hands you got you've got a
[45:45] problem with it you better get it off
[45:47] the hands and into the heart
[45:49] right
[45:50] now that'll that'll save us
[45:52] all right but now watch this point
[45:55] we can say we have accepted his grace
[45:57] for the new birth of the soul
[46:01] but we've been so wrong or mixed up
[46:04] in these old bodies and things that we
[46:06] just can't accept the grace for the rest
[46:09] of us
[46:11] all right now
[46:13] so if you're sitting there thinking i'm
[46:15] too bad to do and i can't do this and i
[46:17] can't well then you let's just see if
[46:19] the lord let me write it down for you
[46:21] well you thought it this morning all
[46:23] right
[46:27] why would we think anything like that
[46:37] when the problem never begun
[46:40] in the bodies
[46:43] we've been through that
[46:45] even say accepted satan's lie
[46:49] in her spiritual being part of her
[46:52] her mind her spirit realm her reasoning
[46:55] factors or things
[47:00] and then that brought death
[47:03] right right
[47:05] it was not first the act and then you
[47:06] had to then she got to thinking about it
[47:10] you're all messed up
[47:13] a woman don't commit adultery doing that
[47:15] she first thinks it over
[47:18] right she first accepts a man in her
[47:22] mind
[47:23] then the body follows after that
[47:26] all right
[47:27] now why would we think on those things
[47:32] so let me write let me just see what it
[47:33] will wrote down
[47:34] remember the problem started in the soul
[47:37] because there is a place of unbelief for
[47:40] sin
[47:42] that's where your sin is from
[47:44] all right
[47:46] what are you saying i wouldn't save to
[47:48] do things well we'll get down to that in
[47:50] a minute
[47:51] so do we think that god can save the
[47:53] soul
[47:56] and make our wrongs all right
[48:00] you know
[48:01] can he save the soul and make our wrongs
[48:03] all right
[48:08] but we're bound by these old bodies in
[48:10] these marital situations
[48:14] meaning
[48:17] he would have enough grace to save the
[48:18] soul but he cannot save the rest of us
[48:21] what kind of god are you serving
[48:28] oh you said yes only for the believers
[48:30] okay we i've got that written down too
[48:31] so we'll just keep reading all right
[48:37] but do we think that god can save the
[48:39] soul
[48:40] make our wrongs all right
[48:42] but we're bound by these bodies
[48:45] in our marital situation
[48:50] god has extended the grace
[48:54] to us to the soul
[48:58] why can't we accept that he has extended
[49:00] it for the rest of us
[49:07] all right now i'm trying to preach grace
[49:10] not laying down sloppy grace greasy
[49:11] grace and ungrace and what kind of grace
[49:13] you want to call it i've we've done been
[49:15] through the scriptures
[49:20] all right
[49:24] we say but look at the mess
[49:26] i'm in
[49:28] in this fleshly part that i am
[49:33] look at the mass that i'm in
[49:37] but we still think that
[49:39] the mess of the soul was made all right
[49:42] what kind of a mess was we in before we
[49:44] received the new birth
[49:47] do you understand why i keep saying it
[49:49] you know that the the religious world
[49:51] and even some of the people in the
[49:53] message they believe that we're going to
[49:55] get a new body
[49:58] you know
[49:59] that it's not this body redeemed
[50:03] that we're going to get a new body
[50:05] well now i want that in the scriptures
[50:07] and i want the prophet's message when
[50:09] the prophet said if he drops a book you
[50:10] pick up the book you don't pick up
[50:12] something different
[50:14] jesus went down with nail prints in his
[50:16] hand and raised with nail prints in his
[50:17] hand
[50:19] now come on
[50:20] did he get a new body
[50:22] no he got his body redeemed
[50:25] well i can't understand that because got
[50:26] nail prints that's because of you and i
[50:29] to where we can
[50:30] eternity look at those things what he'd
[50:33] done for us
[50:35] i don't believe in eternity he'll have
[50:36] those erased
[50:40] it's for you and i to see and what it's
[50:41] we we made doubt i put them nail prints
[50:44] sorry what no roman
[50:47] it was my sins that held him to the
[50:48] cross
[50:52] see we can accept
[50:55] the grace of god for the soul
[50:58] but fail to accept it for the rest of us
[51:03] now god has provided the way that we can
[51:05] accept
[51:11] but it's just like a lot of people won't
[51:12] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:14] why because number one they don't
[51:15] believe it's for them only
[51:18] they think it's a blanket
[51:19] blanket
[51:20] thrown out across the world
[51:24] to just anybody under there
[51:28] the bible said that he come to seek and
[51:29] save them to their lost i agree with you
[51:31] he wouldn't all be saved i agree with
[51:33] you the bible agrees with you but we
[51:35] know by his predestination
[51:40] we know that everybody won't be saved
[51:42] right
[51:43] because they won't accept it
[51:45] a pardon is not a pardon unless you
[51:47] accept it as one
[51:52] see now
[51:54] talking to people who claim the new
[51:55] birth
[51:58] but then wonder about the rest of them
[52:02] you know the rest of your being
[52:06] all right
[52:07] we don't believe in disgrace
[52:11] i don't put out where i stand so i don't
[52:12] have to worry about that
[52:14] anybody don't hear me say something they
[52:15] said well go back to please
[52:17] if you have any thoughts whatsoever and
[52:19] want to argue about it come and talk to
[52:21] me about it
[52:24] but go back and listen to what i've said
[52:26] what i've taught
[52:28] jesus said a man cannot divorce his wife
[52:31] except it be for fornication
[52:36] if he does he's committing adultery
[52:37] because she's going to marry again
[52:40] and he said a woman can never in no way
[52:42] whatsoever divorce her husband
[52:45] that's plain and blunt
[52:48] he's got to be dead
[52:52] and a man has got to marry a virgin i've
[52:54] been through that
[52:56] but how many of us
[52:57] you know
[52:59] thought about that when we were marrying
[53:02] or we just thought about the lust that
[53:04] was within us
[53:06] come on be human and sensible i talk
[53:09] plain and when i do people think i'm
[53:11] sarcastic or nasty you married first by
[53:14] lust
[53:16] the second time you might have got
[53:18] married by love
[53:21] you learned to love
[53:23] oh no it was love at first shot
[53:30] no it was lust
[53:34] brother dale you're just mean
[53:37] is it true
[53:43] you see church
[53:45] we just pity pattern play around instead
[53:47] of being straight and honest people
[53:48] think brother dale don't preach he don't
[53:50] preach like everybody else on women
[53:51] hiring clothes and dress
[53:53] no i just say it like this if you can't
[53:55] get right in your clothes and your hair
[53:56] and your dress you lost
[54:00] if the men can't get straight in the way
[54:01] they're supposed to be the loss
[54:04] but i don't preach on it every
[54:08] service run around him every service
[54:11] yeah he was preaching to the world
[54:15] all right
[54:17] now watch
[54:20] but we say look at what i have done
[54:25] is there any hope for me
[54:36] not if you will not accept it as being
[54:40] for you
[54:42] amen
[54:44] there is no hope for you if you want to
[54:45] accept it that's right
[54:48] people have come to me and come to this
[54:50] church and say brother dale i got this
[54:51] problem this and that and the other i
[54:52] said well sit down and listen to a while
[54:57] sit down and listen a while
[55:01] you might find out things are a whole
[55:02] lot different different what you think
[55:07] he said i don't listen to why
[55:09] because i thought we believe faith comes
[55:11] by hearing and hearing by the word now i
[55:12] thought we started off talking about
[55:14] faith as a revelation of god's will
[55:16] that was written in his word
[55:20] the prophet even there in 64 he said
[55:23] if you'll believe who i he said
[55:25] don't do nothing until you hear from me
[55:28] he's because they've been places made
[55:30] before for these things
[55:34] he had the scriptures
[55:37] but when he come out of there and said i
[55:39] say unto you that was thus saith the
[55:41] lord
[55:42] that was even greater than thus saith
[55:44] the lord you know the point of what i'm
[55:45] getting at
[55:47] paul didn't say thus saith the lord paul
[55:49] said i say
[55:51] that's stronger than thus saith the lord
[55:55] come on are we in the message
[55:57] everybody wants to get into these great
[55:58] third pools and say and you know uh
[56:03] paul said it's not the lord but i say
[56:07] that's pretty strong in it
[56:10] then turn around and say if you don't
[56:11] believe it the way i said it
[56:12] that's right
[56:14] let you be accursed that's right amen
[56:16] but we don't want to talk like that do
[56:18] we
[56:23] see we must believe that
[56:25] god died for us
[56:28] right
[56:30] to take our place yes
[56:35] the prophet of god said when a fall came
[56:37] he said god saw the mess with his end
[56:39] said he had to make a wave he's going to
[56:40] save us and said he did said he came
[56:43] himself
[56:46] to take our place
[56:48] well my god can't die well mine didn't
[56:51] die physically
[56:53] but the life left out of the body
[56:56] and went up i have no problem with that
[56:58] because this is what he said into thy
[56:59] hands i come in my spirit
[57:01] that body died
[57:03] that's right
[57:04] to take my place amen so i went to hell
[57:06] to make sure i didn't have to follow it
[57:08] dark
[57:09] all right
[57:11] but you see what i mean
[57:13] do you believe
[57:15] god has saved your soul amen by the new
[57:18] birth
[57:20] do you believe that
[57:22] you know if not the altar is open
[57:28] that's the one thing we need to get
[57:29] straight whether or not we're born again
[57:32] if we can't believe we're born again
[57:34] it's not even talking about the rest of
[57:35] the word of god
[57:37] it's not to us
[57:39] the bible is not written as head to the
[57:41] center it says to the saints at ephesus
[57:46] it doesn't say to the world it's not
[57:47] written to our world
[57:50] it's written to those that are in christ
[57:52] jesus
[57:53] because they're the only ones can
[57:54] understand it
[57:56] all right
[57:58] would you believe that god has saved
[57:59] your soul
[58:01] and that you have the new birth i'm
[58:02] asking you a personal question to
[58:04] everybody in here i can start the front
[58:06] nine nine nine
[58:08] take all day but get around every night
[58:11] do you really believe that you're born
[58:12] again if you're not that's the one thing
[58:14] you ought to be dealing with you don't
[58:15] have to worry about the rest of yourself
[58:19] the rest of yourself can be taken care
[58:20] of but if you don't believe you're born
[58:22] again that nothing can be taken care of
[58:25] so then the new birth as the prophet
[58:26] would say is the most important thing in
[58:28] your life
[58:31] if you're not satisfied with that then
[58:32] there's where you're hung out because
[58:34] there's no need of trying to deal with
[58:35] the flesh you can't straighten out
[58:38] we'll get to it on the invisible union
[58:39] where the prophet of god said she can be
[58:41] forgiven but can never be justified he
[58:44] said because she done it
[58:49] now we got to get in there and cover
[58:50] something on that then he turned around
[58:52] and said she's not only
[58:54] forgiven said she's justified he said
[58:58] the real you never did even do it we got
[59:01] a lot to call
[59:03] but think about it
[59:05] you realize that if god has set has
[59:08] accepted you and given you the new birth
[59:11] he has accepted your faith
[59:17] come on he's accepted your faith in him
[59:21] or else he would not give you the new
[59:23] birth
[59:25] you know do things haphazardly
[59:29] that's why a lot of people don't get the
[59:30] new birth one off they're not told by
[59:32] the preachers they need it oh we're in
[59:33] the message all you gotta do is believe
[59:35] the message well the devil believes it
[59:37] that makes him saved
[59:42] no you shouldn't be that away brother
[59:44] dale you should give us grace grace for
[59:46] what
[59:49] grace is a revelation of god's word
[59:54] grace is not your ideas or my ideals
[59:57] or opinions or thoughts or what grandma
[59:59] said her mama said
[1:00:04] i told you about it where my mom messed
[1:00:06] up
[1:00:08] my mom messed up telling my wife one day
[1:00:10] that
[1:00:10] daddy was 45 years old before he got
[1:00:12] married
[1:00:15] that's just plain
[1:00:17] there's 13 of us and i'm the 13th
[1:00:21] but there's reading the bible or
[1:00:23] studying it one day and mama said eve
[1:00:25] ate an apple he just laughed at her he
[1:00:27] said that wasn't an apple he told her
[1:00:28] what happened
[1:00:30] now my daddy wasn't no prophet i don't
[1:00:32] claim to be a prophet i ain't said
[1:00:33] nothing about that
[1:00:36] i'm saying he was just old enough and
[1:00:38] settled enough and an old man
[1:00:42] if you don't believe that old men and
[1:00:44] old people don't know a lot about it
[1:00:47] i invite you to go by the newsstand this
[1:00:50] afternoon
[1:00:51] and pick up you a playboy magazine
[1:00:56] they'll tell you in a hurry what
[1:00:58] happened in the garden even to the snake
[1:01:00] crawling around the women i've seen that
[1:01:02] on the pictures of them
[1:01:06] you remember the story i told you about
[1:01:08] it
[1:01:10] i said it to a little cubicle office for
[1:01:12] about 10 by 10 there planting a little
[1:01:15] wall on them you know i had a lot of
[1:01:16] time to study and to do things and i
[1:01:18] just kept all my books in my boston
[1:01:20] office and you know
[1:01:22] he was fine with me but
[1:01:25] boy told me that playboy magazine had an
[1:01:27] article on the pyramids of egypt
[1:01:30] say hey i'm studying on that would you
[1:01:31] mind getting me one
[1:01:33] i didn't want to go get one because i
[1:01:35] knew what everybody say oh look at the
[1:01:36] prey trick i don't think man on there
[1:01:39] but he brought it to me and i was
[1:01:40] sitting there reading it
[1:01:42] pretty good article on it you know
[1:01:45] guy comes over and looks down in there
[1:01:46] where i was at and he said uh-huh we
[1:01:48] caught the preacher
[1:01:50] he's reading the playboy magazine
[1:01:54] that black guy was named beck
[1:01:58] because he knows him brother didn't even
[1:02:00] know it
[1:02:03] he was hollering at everybody
[1:02:05] there was a white guy
[1:02:06] this black guy grabbed him and slammed
[1:02:08] him against the office so i didn't get
[1:02:10] up and argue with him because i wasn't
[1:02:11] going to work
[1:02:12] he slammed that guy against that office
[1:02:13] and he said let me tell you something
[1:02:16] i brought the book to him
[1:02:18] because he's studying on the pyramids of
[1:02:20] egypt and there's an article in there
[1:02:22] you know that nobody never said another
[1:02:23] word
[1:02:26] that's afraid to say anything
[1:02:30] because he told them what happened
[1:02:33] tell you something else he told tom
[1:02:35] tom asked him said you know sam daley
[1:02:37] said yeah he said what scale do you put
[1:02:38] sam dale on he said from one to a 10
[1:02:40] said he's an 11.
[1:02:42] he was a great guy we had
[1:02:44] a lot of understanding a lot of talk no
[1:02:48] joke sitting on the table no wider than
[1:02:50] this one end of it i had
[1:02:52] the bible in books on the other end of
[1:02:54] it he had playboy magazine no joke
[1:02:57] i wouldn't
[1:03:04] i didn't care what he's written
[1:03:08] hey i'm a human i don't care what he's
[1:03:10] reading that didn't have to do with me
[1:03:12] pictures don't do no good except cause
[1:03:14] your problem
[1:03:16] but getting back to what dad was dad
[1:03:18] told my mother said
[1:03:21] i know what happened there
[1:03:24] so a little time went on we'd come on
[1:03:26] into the message and got come into it
[1:03:28] and my mom was talking to my wife again
[1:03:30] one day and she said i just don't
[1:03:31] believe that what y'all believe
[1:03:33] she said what said well what happened in
[1:03:35] the garden about eve having a
[1:03:36] relationship with that beast
[1:03:39] my wife told her said
[1:03:42] mom
[1:03:44] did you said
[1:03:46] that mr dale told you what happened
[1:03:49] mom never mentioned that again
[1:03:53] why because she was the one that
[1:03:55] trapped her own self
[1:03:58] you see plain common sense will tell you
[1:04:00] what happened in the garden
[1:04:03] you read in a newspaper
[1:04:05] and there's a man and woman put on an
[1:04:06] island
[1:04:07] and ain't nobody out there but a snake
[1:04:10] and he's a beast
[1:04:13] and she winds up pregnant and has two
[1:04:15] kids
[1:04:16] your papers will tell you exactly what
[1:04:18] happened well yeah we're so spiritual we
[1:04:20] don't want we don't want to talk about
[1:04:21] stuff like that
[1:04:24] it's true
[1:04:25] come on
[1:04:27] getting back to the point
[1:04:30] if we can't if we can believe that god
[1:04:32] saved the soul by the new birth
[1:04:35] that means he accepted your faith in him
[1:04:38] or he would not have saved you
[1:04:40] all right now you say well i don't know
[1:04:42] whether the grace of marriage enforces
[1:04:43] from me or not i never try to tell
[1:04:45] nobody who is far
[1:04:46] i tell you about it
[1:04:48] you must go before god
[1:04:50] and plead your own case
[1:04:54] i cannot plead your case to god
[1:04:56] and i will not tell you you're okay
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:05] i'll tell you to go before god and seek
[1:05:08] god for
[1:05:09] a revelation
[1:05:13] well i i think
[1:05:15] that the lord could forgive just a
[1:05:16] little bit
[1:05:18] but he can't forgive mine it's too big
[1:05:20] now you're not saved in the soul to
[1:05:22] start with
[1:05:25] because hey that's where my problem was
[1:05:27] at i don't know whether you believed it
[1:05:28] or not and my problem was that i was a
[1:05:31] self-righteous hypocrite i guess you'd
[1:05:33] go
[1:05:34] because you see i didn't drink smoke
[1:05:36] stuff like that
[1:05:41] quit all dating whatsoever over a year
[1:05:43] before i'd marry my
[1:05:49] i wife you about these things
[1:05:54] brother carly he kind of rebuked me one
[1:05:55] time because i was up here talking about
[1:05:57] it and i said as paul said i'm a
[1:05:59] chiefest of sinners
[1:06:01] and that's what i said i'm the chief of
[1:06:02] the sinners see paul was the closest to
[1:06:05] the truth
[1:06:06] he was a guy without a flaw in his life
[1:06:10] that's close
[1:06:11] i had flaws
[1:06:15] but you see i accepted him as my savior
[1:06:19] and it took me two years
[1:06:22] for that to come to pass
[1:06:26] i just accepted the lord and i got
[1:06:27] everything at one time i'm okay
[1:06:32] you start arguing about the word and
[1:06:33] i'll tell you you didn't get what you're
[1:06:35] talking about
[1:06:36] is that plain enough
[1:06:39] plain enough i'm running late
[1:06:44] but you see if we can accept salvation
[1:06:46] for our souls
[1:06:49] why can't we accept it for the body let
[1:06:50] me get this point and i'll just quit it
[1:06:52] you said well wait a minute brother dale
[1:06:54] said the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:06:56] we're quoting brother brown is for his
[1:06:58] followers only you remember that over
[1:06:59] and over
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:03] this is the point that i wrote down
[1:07:04] because it's what i want us to talk
[1:07:06] about
[1:07:10] we know that salvation is for everyone
[1:07:14] but everyone won't receive it is that
[1:07:16] true
[1:07:18] all right
[1:07:19] then if everyone now listen to me very
[1:07:22] carefully you on the internet listen
[1:07:24] don't quote me wrong say it the way i
[1:07:26] say it
[1:07:28] then if every one would receive
[1:07:31] the new birth
[1:07:36] come into this message proving that's a
[1:07:38] new birth
[1:07:40] because it will bring you into the
[1:07:41] message
[1:07:43] then that would mean everybody in the
[1:07:45] world would be following this message if
[1:07:46] they had the new birth
[1:07:49] you agree with that
[1:07:51] if you don't you got a problem
[1:07:54] you want me to state that again you say
[1:07:56] the greatest american divorce is only
[1:07:58] for the followers if you get everybody
[1:08:01] born again that means they're followers
[1:08:04] i don't know where i would divorce this
[1:08:06] evening but that's all right
[1:08:09] i can cough drop it enough and holler
[1:08:13] but you see if everybody get the new
[1:08:14] birth
[1:08:16] and hear of this message they would come
[1:08:18] in this message and they would be
[1:08:19] followers of the message
[1:08:21] which brother random say it was only for
[1:08:22] the jeffersonville group
[1:08:26] come on
[1:08:27] no he said it was those who follow in
[1:08:28] the message
[1:08:30] if you don't have the new birth you
[1:08:31] can't follow the message
[1:08:34] come on you can't follow the message if
[1:08:36] you don't have a new word you just line
[1:08:37] your clothes up get your hair dressed
[1:08:39] right but that don't mean you're saved
[1:08:42] the prophet said you can have your
[1:08:43] dresses dragging the ground you're hard
[1:08:45] dragging on top of that and still be
[1:08:47] lost
[1:08:49] he said don't say that's mates you say
[1:08:51] because it doesn't
[1:08:53] that is an attribute
[1:08:56] remember
[1:08:58] sin was not
[1:09:01] eve having a relationship with the beast
[1:09:05] sin was when eve received satan in her
[1:09:07] mind and paul said that i fear lest
[1:09:10] satan through his sentiment
[1:09:13] amen take you away from the revelation
[1:09:15] of the simplicity of jesus christ
[1:09:22] that's where you remember the lady
[1:09:23] brother random kept talking about said
[1:09:25] drinking is not a sin gambling is not a
[1:09:27] sin smoking not our sin adultery is not
[1:09:29] a sin the lady father
[1:09:31] pray tell me brother random what is sin
[1:09:33] he said it's unbelief
[1:09:36] there's only one sin it's unbelief
[1:09:38] that's what he's done in the garden she
[1:09:40] disbelieved god you know when the quote
[1:09:42] brought around he said he was messed up
[1:09:44] on hebrews 13 8.
[1:09:46] you need that quote because she couldn't
[1:09:48] see that he was the same yesterday today
[1:09:50] and forever or she would have done what
[1:09:52] she done
[1:09:54] you should have seen it that way
[1:09:58] you see the point i'm trying to get us
[1:10:00] to
[1:10:01] if everybody would receive the new birth
[1:10:04] everybody would be followers of the
[1:10:06] message
[1:10:09] come on
[1:10:16] you mean god has made a way but
[1:10:21] you know
[1:10:23] you mean brother dale i've got to accept
[1:10:25] it
[1:10:26] yes
[1:10:28] it's not a pardon
[1:10:30] listen
[1:10:32] but russ said if you can't believe this
[1:10:34] is from fellowship don't pull these up
[1:10:36] going down to go to number six and
[1:10:38] number seven all right get these on the
[1:10:39] screen and i'll just quote these up
[1:10:42] e30 of the fellowship 55 8 13 brought
[1:10:44] around says you can't believe he said no
[1:10:46] wonder says you've never been born again
[1:10:50] all right that's what he said
[1:10:53] jesus
[1:10:54] calling jesus on the scene go ahead with
[1:10:56] number six numbers 14.
[1:11:00] because grace said you must accept it
[1:11:04] now the children of israel got into
[1:11:06] trouble
[1:11:08] and got to cadence barnea
[1:11:10] now this is not where he says blot out
[1:11:12] my name you know out of the book that's
[1:11:13] over in exodus and numbers
[1:11:16] they've gotten in trouble
[1:11:19] and as they'd gotten in trouble there
[1:11:22] moses stood before them and said lord
[1:11:26] if you read back up above him he said
[1:11:27] lord
[1:11:29] i said if you don't take these people in
[1:11:30] because he god said just separate
[1:11:32] yourself i'll just kill every one of
[1:11:33] them
[1:11:34] he said if you don't take these in lord
[1:11:37] said it'll be said
[1:11:39] that you could bring them out but
[1:11:40] couldn't take them in now that's before
[1:11:42] this
[1:11:43] so what did he say
[1:11:46] now go ahead going up number six
[1:11:52] all right number 14 19-20 this is moses
[1:11:56] pardon
[1:11:57] i beseech thee
[1:11:59] the iniquity of this people
[1:12:01] according to the greatness of thy mercy
[1:12:05] and as thou hast forgiven this people
[1:12:08] from egypt
[1:12:10] until now
[1:12:11] back up before the industry you read it
[1:12:13] he's talking about that they
[1:12:15] he said
[1:12:17] god brought them out but can't take them
[1:12:18] in he said now lord don't let your
[1:12:20] enemies say that
[1:12:21] in other words it's going to be out
[1:12:22] fighting against them all the time
[1:12:24] well look look what the lord the lord
[1:12:25] said i have pardoned according to thy
[1:12:28] word
[1:12:30] now you think moses didn't give a grace
[1:12:36] i have pardoned according to thy word
[1:12:43] isaiah 55 and 7. i didn't give him that
[1:12:46] but he says he will abundantly
[1:12:50] pardon
[1:12:53] pardoned
[1:12:59] do we have the new birth
[1:13:02] if we have the new birth then we're
[1:13:03] pardoned
[1:13:06] there can't be any marks left against
[1:13:07] your soul and you call it you know if
[1:13:10] you have the new birth
[1:13:11] because that would be satan living
[1:13:12] inside of you
[1:13:14] but we have these bodies in spirit realm
[1:13:16] of us
[1:13:18] that are causing us problems
[1:13:21] but if we can't believe god made our
[1:13:22] soul free how can we believe he made the
[1:13:24] body free but if we can believe he made
[1:13:26] the soul free then there's hope
[1:13:29] there is hope
[1:13:31] only if you can believe it
[1:13:34] are you offering a grace do i blanket no
[1:13:37] i'm not offering anything because i
[1:13:38] don't have it
[1:13:41] i didn't stand there and say tell them
[1:13:43] to go on as they are that was brother
[1:13:44] branham
[1:13:47] now i do have the scriptures
[1:13:52] i do have the prophet's message
[1:13:56] that can show that we're in certain ways
[1:13:58] things are covered
[1:14:03] how did ray have the harlot come in and
[1:14:05] marry an israeli general and wind up
[1:14:07] coming from there with jesse and boaz in
[1:14:09] them
[1:14:12] somebody had some grace somewhere
[1:14:20] somebody had some understanding of god
[1:14:22] somewhere
[1:14:24] you think about a clone musician you
[1:14:26] just think about it
[1:14:29] moses
[1:14:33] he'd been in the presence of god so many
[1:14:35] times and he knew
[1:14:37] that nothing could stand in his presence
[1:14:39] and things like that he knew those
[1:14:40] things right
[1:14:46] but he knew that if he could in some way
[1:14:51] he knew that it had been done before
[1:14:53] who was it was it abraham dealing with
[1:14:55] god and said if there's 50 down there
[1:14:57] everywhere it was in the bible you put
[1:14:59] the one supposed to be
[1:15:00] he said face 50 down there
[1:15:02] will you spare him he said i'll spare
[1:15:04] him for 50.
[1:15:06] he got thinking about it hey i probably
[1:15:08] can't find 50. that's going to be a bad
[1:15:10] number
[1:15:12] he said lord if he's 40 lord said okay
[1:15:14] that's 40.
[1:15:16] if it's 30 okay if it's 30. he wound up
[1:15:19] and said if it's 10.
[1:15:23] well she wasn't 10 because you only got
[1:15:24] lot and his wife and
[1:15:27] a couple of kids right
[1:15:30] so there wasn't 10 of them down here
[1:15:32] but still god said yes for 10 i'll do it
[1:15:44] listen folks
[1:15:48] why can't we believe in the grace of god
[1:15:52] now remember one thing brother dale
[1:15:54] preaches is straight honest and flat
[1:15:57] grace does not cover future things
[1:16:00] if you're thinking that away
[1:16:03] grace covers the past
[1:16:06] there is no grace for a future that's
[1:16:08] catholicism
[1:16:11] that's the catholic church who sold the
[1:16:12] right to go out and do what you wanted
[1:16:14] to and pay for it before you ever
[1:16:16] started that's wrong
[1:16:20] grace is for the past
[1:16:25] well i'll go out and and i'll go get
[1:16:27] married and then i'll come back tell
[1:16:29] brother dale
[1:16:30] you come back tell brother daley don't
[1:16:31] tell you you're wrong
[1:16:37] if you'd already went through something
[1:16:38] like that me and you might be able to
[1:16:40] talk some ways but not
[1:16:43] grace is not for future sins
[1:16:46] there is no such thing in the bible
[1:16:50] grace is for the past
[1:16:53] pardon is a pardon unless received is
[1:16:56] not a pardon unless received as a pardon
[1:16:58] the pardon meant the man had done done
[1:16:59] what he done
[1:17:04] how about it
[1:17:05] have we been pardoned
[1:17:12] but yeah we like to make talks of the
[1:17:14] man that put out the movie no pardon
[1:17:15] twice
[1:17:17] you know he's pardoned from sin or then
[1:17:19] and brought then he was pardoned out of
[1:17:21] prison
[1:17:23] that's a wonderful story
[1:17:29] but you see church
[1:17:30] i don't care about getting out of prison
[1:17:35] he said well that was good to get out
[1:17:36] that's good to get out that was that
[1:17:37] would go to some governor or somebody to
[1:17:38] sign him out that's fine that was good
[1:17:42] but you let me be pardoned once i want
[1:17:44] to praise the glory of god whether i'm
[1:17:46] in jail or out of jail amen
