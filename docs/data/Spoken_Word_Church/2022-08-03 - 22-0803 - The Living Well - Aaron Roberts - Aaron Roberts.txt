and lord what the what the people have need of lord just give them the words to speak and lord we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen john chapter four beginning verse six says now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being worried with his journey set thus on the whale and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were going away under the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew ask us drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water or thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drink of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drink of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen god bless you tonight you can have your seats and this is from the ma i want to read this quote this is from the message remembering the lord and brother brown says he said the immoral woman that jesus found up at cecar up there that she was a samaritan which was rather an off-cast people that that really believed god they was about half jew and half gentile and there was a race they believed in god and this little moral woman in her condition very marred by sin and one day perhaps had got discouraged with all the traditions of the elders of pots and kettles and washings and so forth she went out one day to the same old jacobs well up there and she was going to let down her bucket to get some water and she changed springs oh how she can remember that there was one setting there that said in him was living water what a thrill it was to her when that living whale revealed her sins and told her where she was wrong and described what she had did to her and it put a message in her heart that set her on fire with the glory of god and into the city and to the men and so i just want to speak on the living well and what caught my attention was where brother branham says and that living well spoke to her and so jesus was you know sitting there on the well that day and was looking but you know we know the scripture says that he had need to go by samaria because he there was one for him to come to to speak to that day and it was hard but you know it was so it was so when you read the scripture and brother branham begins to speak of this woman and you see the kind of condition that the woman lived in and her background and all that kind of stuff and even here he talks about you know she grew up and become discouraged with things that was going on and you know there's things that happen in life that's not always our fault and things that get out of our control that we can't we can't control the things that happen to us but you know we just have to do the best we can but you know god is is mindful of those things he's mindful because you know there's never been a day in your life there's never been anything that's come across your path that god didn't know about ahead of time there wasn't predestinated that he knew what's going to take place that was going to happen to you but with but the scripture tells us with every avenue whatever problem that comes our way whatever trial or tribulation he said there's a way of escape that's made for us so god made a way that we would overcome whatever come our way so we look at we you know as we get discouraged sometimes people get upset with things but you know what god's made a way and you know there is a way made and i was so thankful that you know we have a place to come to and many times the problem is is we get things in our lives that we don't know how to handle where there's a place to come to and what was so what was so great about this woman to live in the moral immoral life and all the things that she had went through in her life and and all the things that she had to deal with but you know what jesus come to where she was going to be jesus crossed her path one day so he knew where she was going to be and he sat there waiting on the whale waiting for her so the whale was there for her because he began because he knew she come to draw water natural water but you know it was time for her to receive spiritual water because that's exactly what she had a longing for and had a desire and jesus was there to meet her need he come across her path to give her what she had need of now she didn't realize what was going to take place but you know what jesus knew where she was at and what she had need of and brothers and sisters i want you to know something tonight you know whatever you go through in life whatever happens thank god god knows ahead of time what's going to come your way he's going to have he's already got a way made he's already got your escapement the problem is is we don't have our eyes on the whale we don't have our eyes on jesus to know where he's leading us to but i'm so thankful you know because we can come into this oasis tonight because this place is an oasis here for us to come here and we can draw on living water we can receive what we have need of tonight you say well i come tired i come sick i i come defeated whatever it is well guess what there is a place as brother branham said this is a place of refreshing this is a place where the holy ghost will refresh you and he'll touch you from the top of your heads the soles of your feet and he will renew you and strengthen you and he will renew you in the inner man so that you overcome the outer man and let me tell you brothers and sisters i i hadn't felt good today and everything but you know i tell you what i'm not giving up on what because i've come here to speak something because i believe god gave me something to say and i'm going to fight every devil in hell why because i'm going to say what god gave me to say i'm not i'm not backing up i'm not stopping because i'm going to give everything i got why because god gave me everything that he had i'm going to give him everything i've got and y'all may have to carry me out of this building tonight but i still believe i'm going to give him everything i got and i'm gonna fight him all the way and because you know what i'm not gonna give up i'm not gonna quit why because he didn't quit on me because he's given me a way to overcome i'm so thankful why because we've got one that's mindful of us so where we are or what we're facing praise god god knows where you're at and he knows what you're facing he knows what you're going through see even and sometimes we look at things and we see things in in life and we see things and we don't understand why things happen the way they do and you and you start to look at people and one of the problems that people have is that they'll get things on their mind and they start to look at people and they say well this person is not at a certain level or this person is not where they ought to be well you know what god is mindful of them too and sometimes we get in our mind that we that we are that we almost you know we get on our on our pedestal sometimes and think we're better than other people and it's like well i don't i don't try to be like it well you know what the devil puts that in your mind the devil battles you you know what i don't care how holy you are how righteous you are how christian you are you know what you still fight them the thoughts the devil still will tell you and put that thing in you and just like brother branham you know as great as brother brandon was he still fought complexes he still fought things that he had to go through every single day and he had to stay say and repent and pray through he didn't change who he was but you know why because we're all we're all human we're all we're all fighting battles we're all failures i mean if we just if we just looked at our faults and failures and all all our problems you know we you know we could we could just sit around like like they used to do on hee haw you know we just say gloom despair and agony on me you know we could just sing that all day long gloom despair and agony on me deep dark depression excessive misery oh if it weren't for a bad luck i'd have no luck at all no no how does that how does that encourage face how does that increase your faith at all how does how does i do anything for anybody but people but people they'll get on and now it's the worst whatever whatever the worst thing is man they get on that and that's all they ride that horse till the end and you walk into work and you know you're just like you want to put your earplugs in and you and you can't put enough earplugs in your ears they don't sell them up well enough but some people you know you see them coming and you don't want to get near them why because why because they ain't got nothing they got nothing positive to say they got nothing encouraging to say and you know some people you get around and they'll just suck the life right out of you but you know what god has given us something that's to over to encourage us to strengthen us to increase our faith that when we come up you know i know you know whatever comes my way praise god i i was thinking about i listened to part of brother donnie's sermon last night and and north carolina and you know and there's brother brother ron sitting up there behind him and you know they you get brother ron's getting all excited and clapping and it's like well you know that man's and a lot of people they would look at that and say you know you're dying stage four cancers like you know but you know what he's not he's he's enjoying his self he's enjoying himself in the word why because he knows who he is and he knows what god you know you can only do so much and after that you got to put it in god's hands you know in the message letting off the pressure brother random meets that woman and he was she was so young looking that that when she was so young looking that she had grown children he was amazed at how young she looked and and she told her brother branham she said i realize when i become a christian you know i put all my cares on him because i couldn't deal with him and said if he can't take care of him i surely can't take care of him so you know what there's no need of both of us carrying them there's no need of both of us worrying about him because he told me to roll him on him so if i'm rolling it up on him then you know what it's not my job to take care of him anymore why because he said that he would do that and when she laid it on him then you know then when he done that then she was able to have all that free that freedom because she was in christ and she knew what god had done for her and she took him at his word just like that man was talking about you know it talks about the oil of joyful morning and and there in uh i believe that's uh isaiah but uh you know this talks about um put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness and said you know to put on the be all of joy for mourning that man there was a man years ago he was talking about you know he said he said that's better that's better than ever any olive olay or max factor or any kind of other thing that you are if you ever get the oil of joy if you'll ever get anointed with the joy of the lord said that that'll better that's better than any medicine that god than any man has ever come up with if you can just get in the oil of joy and and take on that because he said it's joy unspeakable and full of glory if you can ever get into that then you know what it's beyond anything that man will ever come up with any kind of pill or any kind of everything because you know people today they're all the time trying to find the next high they're trying to find the next excitement they're trying to find something that's going to fill that void but you know they they reach that plateau at one point but they never can reach the excitement that they reached before but let me tell you something brothers and sisters this right here you can't you just continue to grow the more the lord opens things up and the more you grow in christ and the more god shows you and you reach a higher place then you know what it's better than it was before every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before because if you ever get to the place where it's not as exciting if it's not as a blessing to you as it was before if it's not as sweet if it's not just life-changing as it was before that it's time to come back to the altar because we've left god but you know if you're still walking with god it's greater and greater the trials may be harder it may it may be tougher you know but you know what it's greater because it's sweeter because the more you overcome the greater you see that god has brought you through what god has brought you to and now we see who god is in our lives and we can praise god there's many people that want to you know they they trying to worship god and but you know you you begin to look and and realize what god has done for you when you begin to look into the into the treasure chest that god has for us when we begin to look what god has done for us what god has in store for us he said you know he said we can we can't even comprehend these things eyes not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart of man what god has in store for him so when we become we begin to feed on these things and realize what god is you know we can't even put wrap our mind around what god how because how can you explain how can you understand an inexhaustible fountain of life of everlasting life but you know what we have the opportunity to come and drink and drink and drink and he's and he's been us to come and so we come would drink drink of this this fountain just like that little fish that brother ram talked about there you know you know out there in the ocean wondering you know well i better drink sparingly no don't drink sparingly you need to drink all that you can drink you need to get all that you can why because there's more than you than you realize because the more you take the more god has for you and the more you take the more god has for you and you begin to see as you begin to drink he said then you begin to drink and all of a sudden you begin to push out why because there's something on the inside because he said he said from the inside from the inner man he said there would be a river of flowing of life that's going to come out there's a wellspring that's going to come up so the more you take in the more it's going to come out then if it comes and you begin to manifest it to everybody everybody begins to see who you are that you have received this what a wonderful thing that what god has done for us that we can see what god has done for us god has blessed us and given us these things well we got to do is just continue to drink from it to realize that this whale is there for us now i want to look here in the in the scripture and look at the life of abraham and and um you know and abraham's life and here here's abraham and we know that abraham was given a promise an old man and all the things that he had been through in his life and but you know god made a promise to him that he was going to have children that he said he said can you count the stars in the heavens and he said no he said well that's the way your seed's going to be he said can you count the sand of the sea and he said no he said well that's the way your seed's going to be well you know as as god began to speak to abraham and he began to walk in that word well you know every single day after walking all those years and living with with sarah and never having any children but you know god began to speak to him and he began to walk in that and you know every day he got older and all and his his circumstances never changed he was continually walking as an old man and no no doubt he woke up and he had more aches and pains and he had he was slower to get up in the morning and he probably couldn't remember as well as he did the day before but you know what he still had the promise that he was going to be the father of nations and he began to walk in that and began to walk in there well you know he had all kinds of different problems that you know he gave away his wife and the different things that happened to him but you know what it never changed who he was it never changed the promise that he had he began to walk in that and as he began to walk and he began to see these things but then you know as he began to walk and he began to meditate on this word and sarah began to meditate on what god had promised them because she was in the promise also so that it was going to be both of them together it was going to bring forth this son and you know and then and we know in time you know they began to get a little bit uh a little bit weary about things they began to get things they tried to figure things out on their own you know they got to a place where they wanted to figure these things out and you know they thought well you know what god gives us these problems these promises but you know what i think we can help him out we've got a way that we can do this and we're going to we're going to help the lord out because i think there's a way that this will take place but you know god told abraham and sarah he said but you through sarah he told abraham through sarah with us the promised seed come the promised son's going to come y'all two will have a child but you know sarah and them you know they begin to look at these things it's like well i don't know how this is going to take place but i see well you know here's a way and and all of a sudden you know somebody comes up with this bright idea say hey you know god needs help to do is do his work to bring forth his promises so here's here's a young lady by the name of hagar and you know we're gonna and and sarah says well abraham you just take hagar and then you can bring forth a child well it was it was it was great for a while but the problem was is when when the lord spoke to him and you know you take this take her and you have a child but the problem is is it never brings forth the promise and all it does is bring problems it doesn't bring any promises now now we know in the scripture we know we know in the scripture because when when abraham takes hagar then when this when this takes place then all of a sudden we realize that hagar begins to hate sarah and then all of a sudden we see this we see this rift that's going on we see we see this uh tension that takes place in between these two and we see that because of this way that sarah treated hagar she left she ran away and here she is out in the out in the desert running from her her master and her mistress running away trying to escape this but you know what in the midst of all this is she runs runs away and she's trying to hide in the midst of this now listen to this in the midst of all this there becomes an angel of god unto hagar and speaks to her and wants to know where she's at why are you there why have you run away and begins to speak to her and tell her said you're with child you bring forth a son and you know what because he was the seed of abraham the scripture says because he was the seed of abraham that god was going to bless him he was to break he was to be blessed but the scripture also tells us that because he was a wild man that he would bring that every man's hand would be against him and his hand would be against every man why because it was brought forth by the flesh because he was because he was born of the bonds woman and not because of the promise and any time you try to bring forth the promise try to fulfill it and step in into the into the avenue of god and try to god doesn't need your help god needs you to follow his his plan not try to figure it out on your own not think you're going to help because anytime you think you're going to try to help god you're making a mess and so we say that in the midst of all this here she is out hey hagar is out in the desert and she's out by here by herself and the angel lord begins to speak to her and tell her that you need to go back but you'll have you'll bring forth a son and he'll be blessed but he says as he begins to speak to her there in in the in the valley there he begins to speak to her and brother brown mentions three times he talks about this place and it's called bear uh vera lo berlaho roy and it means the uh the well of him that liveth and seeth me so brother brandon mentions this twice there's three times he refers to this whale that she was at but she went to this whale and he begins to tell her what's going to take place for you to go back you go back to abraham you go back to sarah and you're going to bring forth this son now he brings forth she brings forth ishmael and abraham is so joyed that he's that he's got a son you know what because god had god had to do something in his life for him to have children and it's brought forth something but you know what it's not the it's not the promised seed it's not the promised son but he's brought forth his son and and abraham after god's tried to talk to him and tell him what's going to take place oh that ishmael will live before you but you know what there's no place that ishmael is going to live before god why because he's not going to follow that because he's not of the right lineage he's not in the right seat because because he's he's out of that one and let me tell you something brother sisters if we try to do things after the flesh if we try to live after the flesh you know we try we try to we try to uh do the things by the flesh you know we we try to live right we try to do all these things if it's not the holy ghost on the inside living the life he said it's all worthless it's only filthy rags there's there's no righteousness in it at all there's there's no glorifying god in any of it but when when here when ishmael comes forth and and abraham was you know looking at his son but in the in the midst of all this when all the when all of this goes on and he's so wrapped up and god's telling him listen that is not the promised son that's not the promise that i brought you to but he's so focused on ishmael now i want you to understand when he when he becomes so focused on this what what it came of the flesh and many times people people get so wrapped up they want to live so right and they want to live so religious but the problem is it's not the holy ghost we're living after the flesh and you know we we want to live just just so right but the problem is is are we letting the holy ghost do it so when when ishmael grows up we know that god didn't forget his promise to sarah and we know that in time sarah brings forth a son which is the promised it brings forth isaac and then when isaac is weaned from his mother then we realize that ishmael begins to mock isaac because of who he was why because the flesh man is always going to war against the seed the inner man the promised sun that comes forth and so what when when the promised son because the promised son is is the new birth is the new man because the old man's got to go so what happened is because of the warring that takes place between the two because of the tension then ishmael has to be cast out and what and so when sarah comes and tells abraham said you need to cast out the bondwoman and her son then the lord speaks to abraham and says hearken under the voice of sarah because she knows that you've got to separate these two there's got to be a total separation from these two but you know what when when asheville is cast out when when hagar is past is cast out and and he gives them provision and sends them out and she goes out into the desert and we know in time because there's because she has no more than just these their provisions we cut we know that hagar comes to a place that she's about ready to die and ishmael is too they're out in the desert there's no water there's no food there's no nothing she's in dire straits but let me tell you something in the midst of that dire straits and the condition that she was in and she laid out there and she took the baby and she carried him off the scripture said she carried him a bow shot off from her and she said i don't want to hear him die i don't want to see him die she herald she hauled him off and left him and then she came back and she began to pray to god and god began to speak to her you know what when he began to speak to her the angel lord spoke to hagar and said where are you why are you in this condition what's going on began to speak to her but when he began to speak to her and tell her he began to speak to her and then he tells her to look he opens up her vision and she sees a well in the distance and there's a well that she goes to to draw water and she takes the cruise and she goes in the distance to get water and she brings it back to ishmael to give him water do you know what the name of that well is the place that she came to to receive that promise that she was that fulfilled that promise when she came to the place that she was about ready to die god had brought her back and gave her a vision and took her right back to the same place where she was that he had fulfilled that promise why because the promise had been made to her that wherever she was at she was going to bring forth that he was going to bring forth a great nation that his seed would be innumerable but when she got what she got into this place and when he did the scripture says god said i've heard the voice of the lad crying let me tell you something brothers and sisters if i don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl how in the world could a son that's that's of this of the of the flesh that's that's not of the promise and yet god kept his promise to him in the midst of all the problems that he went through where he was into just about ready to die and god had made provisions for him and showed hagar to go right back to the same place that she was when when she was given the promise and brothers and sisters that's the same way with us when we get into hardships and problems what does god do he sends us right back to the same well where he drew us at where he drew before he brought us back to the same place why because when we get away from god what is god doing he's pointing you right back to the same place where you came from he's pointing you back to go back to there well because that's where god's blessings are that's where god's promises are fulfilled in that same place and he sent hagar back to the same place where that where she was before and he gave her water to bring forth the sun man i tell you what if i if i don't three i don't know what does but why because if you see even god is mindful of the sparrows and even even of all people oh the world people and you know and wherever they at how much more is the son of god the ones that are of the seed of abraham how about the more the more the ones that are the called the one the ones that are predestinated to this the one that this has come to if that don't if you don't see if he if he's mindful of them how much more is he mindful of you that he's going to meet your needs hallelujah whoo i could run around the building on that why because you know if god if god is mindful of them how much more is he mindful of me and we look and we look out there and we see we see the world and the condition that people are living in and all these type things but you know what god your heavenly father is mindful of you he knows what you have need of all these things but you know he will bring you to that place what a wonder what a wonderful thing because you know we think well all these people have houses and they have lands and they have all these things you know but but god knows you don't need that i mean i mean people you know the last the last few days and man they're like have you bought your lottery ticket yet have you bought your lottery ticket chin one billion dollars with a bail billion dollars what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with it you can't get out of hell with it you can you can steve jobs one of the richest men in the world and he still died he was sick for cancer for the longest time done all kinds of treatment they've done everything they could for me and you know he still died what is what is it what does it profit you jesus said if you gain the whole world and lose your own soul what what have you gained if you've gained if you gain the whole world a billion dollars well i mean you you probably get half of it after taxes but what are you going to do people people can't can't they can't live on what they got right now and the problem is as brother dave ramsey tells us you know it doesn't change who you are it just magnifies your character so if you can't if you can't manage the money you got now how are you going to manage more money there's people there's people that's made millions and millions of dollars you look at sports figures and and all these people that's made just loads of loads of money and you know and as soon as they get finished some of them as soon as they get finished playing sports they're broke well because they they've not made one preparation of what's going to take place 10 years down the road five years down the road 20 years down the road what are you going to do when you can't play football anymore what are you going to do when you can't when you can't do these things anymore but you know they say we're just we're just living in the moment we're just you know because we we've got we've got to live better than the next person we got we got to keep our name in the in the newspaper we got to keep our name in social media we got to keep putting our name out there so everybody looks at us well you know the thing is is you know the people people that live like that you know they do end up in social media again it's like what happened to so such what happened to this person they made 50 million dollars in their lifetime and now they've got a job at walmart you know so what what good has it done you but you know you try to talk to people about what are you going to do when this life is over with what are you going to do when this is when this is all over with when you die what are you going to do then where are you going to go what what's your plans what have you laid up in store what has what has what has captured your vision of what's going to take place in the future brother branham said in the message remembering the lord he said now we could go on and on with characters talking about the people in the bible he said but let's just let's just think this he said don't miss seeing your whale now don't miss seeing the spot of refreshment that brings life so we got to find the place because we can we can see a lot of other things that can capture our mind capture our vision take our time but if it but if it doesn't have any eternal value to it what a good is it many people many people are chasing many things and it's and it's a great thing it's honorable but you know if you if you decide that you want to be a doctor and you're going to and that's and that's an admirable profession and that's a great thing but you know what if you don't spend as much time chasing god and seeking god's faith as you do trying to trying to understand the anatomy of the human body then you know what you've not gained anything and you know people have spent their lifetime trying to brother randall was talking about that man who spent all of his time trying to study bones and everything he was talking about the bones being 14 million years old and was trying to figure out how old they are and explain all this stuff and he said he's wasted his life why because he said he can't look and just look and pick up the scripture and look into the scripture and take what god said and lo and show that what god said and he said because all of the all of that petrified bone and stuff is not con it's contrary to the scripture and he spent all of his time trying to prove something that's so so many million years old and he's wasted his time how many times people people are out trying to chase something that you know i want to be the the next one that this the next one at that you know that it does what good is it if you've got your name on on youtube what does it matter if you've got your name in the guinness book of world records well i mean what but if you don't have if you don't have your name in the lamb's book of life it doesn't matter there is no other place that your name needs to show up i could care less if anybody knows my name but i do want to know one thing i want people to see that they see jesus christ in me that they can see jesus christ if they can see jesus christ of me that's what i want not not trying to buy the world and and move all these things because there's no there's nothing there and many people many people have had had this opportunity that's coming in contact with this whale that he stood in there in their midst brother brown talks about were they you know people handled him speaking of jesus he walked in their midst they handled him they touched him began to hear him speak what a wonderful thing that was but there's two men that brother ram talk about that that had that had a terrible time and they handled it wrong one was a man by the name of herod and and pilate was the other one and they they began to speak when when jesus was accused and brought before now herod herod had had the opportunity to have have a conference with him to have had an audience with him began to speak to him but you know he said he said the problem that herod had was that when he stood before jesus he never asked for mercy he never called upon his name he said the only thing that herod could do when he stood before jesus was have jesus entertain him we're going to we're going to put this crown of thorns on you we're gonna put the robe on you we're gonna cover up your head and hit you with a and pull your beard out we're gonna hit you in well if you're if you're if you're who you say you are tell us who hit you he was just he was just there for entertainment he said he said the problem that herod had was that he had 4 000 years of the prophets and the law that had laid before him and he had heard all those things and he said yet he turned it all down because he was more interested in entertainment and brother branham says we face a greater condemnation because he said it's been six thousand years of the word and we've heard what we've heard and what we have read and what all the things that god has done in 6 000 years and he said and people turn him down and he said it's a greater condemnation today than it was then he said pilate pilate had a had a great thing that he tried he tried to let jesus go and he could have but you know what he was more interested in what the people had to see he was more interested in what they had to say than what he knew what's truth but you know he come out there oh this just man don't you want me to release the son of the king of the jews no we don't want him we won't barabbas we want an insurrectionist we want a murderer we want this ruffian that's who we bumped this other man well we can't find any fault with him well we don't we still like him you can't find any any any faults with the word but we don't want it don't want to touch it no but what'd he do he walked out there i washed my hands of this but you know what there was there's not enough water in the world that was going to wash the blood of jesus off pilate's hands and you and i we can we can have the same thoughts we can have the same ideas that we think we're going to wash this off our hands but we're not he stepped well because when we've we've had him step in our in our pathway when we've had an audience with him and he's come our way and he spoke to us how much more condemnation for us for what we've heard that we that we have to face we need to take a more earnest heed to the things that we've heard because there's things that in our lives sometimes and and i've had the opportunity to the to have thing to witness things and and you see the condition that things that that things have happened and you you realize that that god sends people across our path and and they are witnesses to us and they are they are rebukes to us i was thinking the other day i was thinking about a there was a young lady that i was acquainted with years ago when she was several years younger than me and she had a she went she went to a message church her grandparents were in the message ever since she was been knee-high to a grasshopper all she's known is this message and you know she was she was all by herself and and she wanted she wanted a friend and she she wanted to have somebody that was her age that had the same likes that she did that you know had hobbies and different things with well the lord sent her a little little girl about the same mate she was about 11 12 13 maybe but this little girl comes along and this girl knew nothing about the scripture she'd never been to church really she lived with her mom and her grandmother but this little girl started coming to church with this girl and this look this little girl all she all she knew was brother branham she all she knew was this message but you know she brought this little girl come along her way this little little teenage girl and she becomes such a rebuke to that girl this young girl she began to come to church and you know what people didn't come to church and talk you can't cut your hair and you can't wear pants and you can't do this you can't do that this little girl come to church and they loved her and they witnessed to her but it's not the do's and don'ts but it's the manifestation of john 3 16. don't you don't you don't have to quote malachi 4 and all that kind of stuff john 3 16. there is a living savior who died for your sins and there is a fountain to cover your sins and for you to come into fellowship with him and this little girl she began she began to see things and it began to prick her heart and this little girl 12 13 years old fought with her grandmother and her mom because she wouldn't go get her hair cut but this other little girl you know she didn't cut her hair she had an accident with a curling iron but you see this little girl she didn't want to wear pants she didn't want to wear shorts but she had to fault her mom and her grandmother because you know what it become a rebuke to them but she had such a desire that when when this took place that her parent her mom and her grandmother refused to let her go to the church anymore because it was such a rebuke because she was so stirred to be such a young girl to make a stand and what a rebuke when you've walked in this all your life this is all you've ever known and you can't stand and make a profession when you can't stand and stand and show the world your true colors when you get some little girl to come off the street doesn't know split peas from coffee grounds about the bible but something stirred in her enough that she would stand and stand against her her her mom and her grandmother that she didn't want to have to do that and i thought what a rebuke but you know what god honor her faith and i just prayed that you know one of these days that maybe the lord crossed her path again this has been years ago i never i never knew what happened to her but i know where the other i know where the first girl is i see her on facebook and i see the life that she lives the pictures she posts and i think what happened when that girl crossed your path you wanted a friend god sent you somebody man it stir it stirs you when because that's what god has for us when we see today the condition that people are in the world is in god has somebody that's standing for the truth and you know it's it's hard to see things but you know what god has given us a way to draw closer to overcome these things when we're rebuked there's a place to come to i i think i i i saw something the other day that stirred me i saw i saw somebody post something on on social media and it and it made some comment about how they lived their life and then and it looked like in it and in the in the caption it looks like you know something that you scrape off your shoe and they said well that that's what i think of people's opinion of how i ought to live my life and what caught my attention was you know sometimes it's not an opinion you know what it's not it's not an opinion sometimes it's the word of god but you but you account the word of god as something you would scrape off your shoe it's so low that it's just like dunk that you would just scrape it off your shoe and it's it's like i i don't i don't want to have anything to do with it it's it's so it's so nasty i don't want to touch it but let me tell you something that is the word of god you got to be careful when you when you hear something and if it comes across this pulpit and you say well i don't like that well you better be careful what you say it is we have to be careful how we think about things why because it may not just be a minister standing up here it may not be brother wade's standing up here because if he's standing in the office that he's called to that it's not it's not him it's god one because those that have been given into position to stand over us and the same with brother dale in the position that they've been placed over us we're supposed the scripture says we're supposed to give them double honor their do double honor but sometimes we say well that's i said well no you got to be careful why because we can get in trouble because if we're not careful of how we handle situations even when it comes to our families why because even even the scripture i think about the scripture you know where it talks about you know we're supposed to honor one another and live together and and those things and and the scripture says you know husbands are supposed to honor their wives and said that their prayers not be hindered well you know and she's supposed to reverence her her husband well you know if we if we just pass things over and not and not try to actually look at things as we ought to then you know what we're dishonoring god and just as we come into this building this sanctuary and we gather in and then you know if we if because if we don't take it as in the seriousness that it's given in then you know what then our prayers are hindered that we have a problem we're hindering the service we're hindering the church and that's that's an important aspect to look at in our lives because when god begins to bring things out it's important for us to realize god's speaking to us brothers and sisters we're not not in not any of us are promised tomorrow we're not even promised tonight and when it comes to times that you have to check up with god and understand what god has called you to and put ourselves before god as the lord what we need what do we need to change i want to change i want to be what you want me to be i was i was thinking about where brother wade was speaking sunday and he was and i'm i'm gonna get on this i got off i'll get off my preaching box i'm gonna get on my meddling box now but you know one in the same i think sometimes but you know he was talking about women in their clothing and the and because you know what you don't have to witness to people your life is your witness so the why the life that we live is the witness to people and the way we handle situations and what we look like when we walk out that is the witness good or bad but that's a witness anyway so when we dress like the world and we act like the world and we do things of the world how do we how do we have a confession to witness that we're separated from the world when we when people are trying to figure out where exactly where the world ends and where christ begins when he's talking about women and their clothes and and different things and you know i would say brother branham said you know they said well brother brother branham said said that's the only kind of clothes they sail that's all they that's all they got around here's them clothes that that are just that you fuss about all the time he said sister they still so sowing machines and sell goods but brother branham said he said the but the problem that we have is that we have he said the problem is is people have given up on going to church and and forsaking the assembling of themselves together and when they do that then that becomes a problem because you know what it's just a it's just a symptom of a greater problem well because if you've not god if you've not got born again and you don't come to church and you don't read your bible and you don't pray and you don't study then you know what you're going to live like that and what caught my attention was i was looking at this thing and and on uh instagram i'm on instagram so yeah y'all pray for me but there's there's there's a thing a little a hashtag or whatever called message believers so anyway i was on there looking and you know what amazed me brother there's a whole bunch of pictures all these women who are message believers and you know they're all dressed modest and here's all these pictures of all these women and it's like wow look at look at this and then as i was scrolling over there there's other uh other uh hashtags or whatever that groups everything together and it was another group and it's all these women and they're apostolic i don't know if any of y'all have ever seen any of that or not but you know what amazed me is here all these apostolic ladies and some of them are all i know about women from all around the world and this one woman she's in a foreign language i think she's portuguese portuguese but i think probably brazil or someplace but anyway she her i had to translate her uh heading when i was looking at it and she said she wanted women to dress elegant but not to give up their principles and she had all of these dresses and skirts and all these things and she was showing all the things that she had and i was like well here's a testimony but you know but some people you know we gotta we gotta it's gotta be like this or that no here's pictures now now when you go through and er i know people spend a lot of time on social media and scrolling everything they got to read all the and play all their farm games and and all that kind of stuff you know but you know if you ever get a chance and you got to stop for a minute won't you go on there and look and you can find all these women that know how to dress properly it was amazing no i know i'm i'm meddling again but that's all right brother i'm big enough i can handle it i got i'm i whatever i'm here that's all right but it's it's still the truth we need to take we need to take a more earnest heed to what we've heard and what we've seen that we need to see what god has for us what god has called us to i want i want god to be i want him to be glorified in all that we do i want him to be honored by what we do what we say we can get wrapped up in a lot of things but god god is what's most important amen and so i want you to tonight let's come to that whale god's called us to this well he's here tonight the fountain of everlasting water inexhaustible fountain here he's here tonight so i'm i'm brother i'm facing this i'm facing that i've got this problem i got that problem you know what he's here let's let's drink from that fountain there's an old song that said there is a well that the thirsty soul can drink from and the purity it brings will never never fail he said not a drop there is wasted for all who have tasted come back to that water every day so if you have a need there's a fountain to come to and drink from that lady beside the whale jesus began to speak to her and tell her what her need was and when he began to speak to her she said sir i perceive you're a prophet we know that when messiah comes he'll do these things and you know what he said i am he amen i am the messiah and you know what she didn't have a desire for any any natural water anymore she dropped that water pot in window of the city and began to testify here's one who's told me all that i've done is this not the very messiah brothers and sisters that's where we are tonight he's here i can say i've seen him amen i can say i've been to calvary and i've seen the lord i love that song i've been to calvary i can say i've seen the lord i've been to calvary through the witness of his word each day at calvary

failures we all fail but you know there's a place to come to just flood where sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their guilty stings amen god bless you tonight let's all stand how the
