========================================

okay now it is all right we've been standing on the statue of a perfect man and we have we are at brotherly kindness and we stopped last week and i told you that we would try to uh read sister shepherd's dream but we'll do that next sunday all right this sunday i want to kind of we've been in the scriptures we know what we know what the bible says about brotherly kindness now listen we can't get around it you can't jump from brotherly kindness up to love so we've got to go through this something we got to go through if you say you're not then then you know i see you interact because you're not going to make a body change maybe we talk about abram wednesday night abraham abram had a promise abram produced something the church ages produced something this message produces the new birth but it doesn't produce a new new birth it's the same new birthday it was on the day of pentecost it came through luther they came through wesley that came to pentecost amen it's just we have a furthermount on the word god has promised us that we were going to have a child but we were going to have to have that child we've done come down here to the end we've got old i hope you saw what i was talking about wednesday night we're at the old part of the we're at the end we're the oldest we're not the youngest we're the oldest of the ages we're the last one the holy ghost was given on the day of pentecost two thousand years ago we ought to know how it operates after two thousand years but it got eat down through the ages but still there was a promise still there was a son born amen jesus christ was birthed into those people but in the end time we're to birth a man abram had strength sarah didn't but abram was wavering in his faith he had faith but remember when you come up to abraham then you hone it down to where abraham said okay now i know i'm going to have to have it by sarah and god i know one thing's for sure you're going to have to do something because i can't produce and sarah can't either we're to the age now to where all human ability is gone right so that's where god's got to get me in youtube we're all you know i thought well we got to get good enough and we got to get this and we got no it's god god's going to have to do the changing we can't change ourselves right all right so god's going to have to do the changing but we're going to have to we're going to have to come under the plan of god to do that we can't do it on our own so we've got to come under the plan of god and the plan of god is is to have virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness not to miss one of them right they had the word down through the age sure but they didn't have it like we got it they didn't have a prophet to come and tell them exactly what everything that bible meant and how to put it together right satan had torn apart he attacks a word he attacks the word when he attacked the word what he done was he broke fellowship he pulled everything away from each other now they still had the holy ghost born again under their own age right everybody was but there was no that was under abram abram had a promise abram could produce a son god can produce down through the ages but remember that's not what god's looking at god's looking at somebody to finish this thing amen okay he's not look it's not saying that he's not looking at martin luther no he was as pleased to dwell in martin luther as he is mean you or he's a changing god so he doesn't change that's right all right so he was just as pleased with martin luther just shall live by faith as he is with your just shall live by faith because that's what you got to start at but martin luther didn't have enough a light of the word to take him on up higher so he lived a good christian life died went by the grave now he's waiting all right and i hope he got that wings tonight and ishmael was produced and ishmael was a wild child but look ishmael got promises ishmael was a promised son to that abram apart from but remember god wasn't looking at that because remember abram comes back and says no additional may live before you and god said hey i'm going to give him promise he's going to get promises he's going to be a wild child pentecost was a wild child right pentecost was wild child so he got a wild child out of that but that wasn't the culmination of i'm going to make you abraham a father of many nations you're going to bring a promised child out of your loins but you're not going to do it with a denominational idea which is the bondwoman i didn't get into that wednesday night maybe i'll do part two but the bondwoman was hagar she was the bondwoman and the bible says that that the bondwoman will not be heir with a free woman but now remember she got a promise remember she was kicked out and she was you know she looked like she was gonna starve to death and and and all that and and the angel of the lord lrd capital l r d god came to her and said hey don't worry your son's going to be there that's what down through the ages god said hey luther your people's going to be there you live by the just showing by faith even though you smoked a pipe and drank beer in a pub your group's going to make it your group's not going to die sure they physically die but spiritually they didn't die right but we come to a place to where god in the back part of his mind as the prophet said brought us up to a place to where we're going to have to bring all them out of the ground with the word that we have so there's no way we can do it with a wild child we have to do it with a promised son isaac we have to do it with the one that can produce isn't it ishmael's seed that's coming after history wow ishmael's seed is it's so mingled you can't as far as natural seed no it's all mixed remember this is all in type this is all in type no i didn't i never said ishmael's people my kids will make it it's in a type ishmael is a type of the church agent if i understand that say amen amen i mean really ishmael is the type of the church ages because you go to a certain point they got a promise but they didn't get the promise of the body change no natural ishmael that no there's well yeah there's going to be some that make it because i'm sure there's some of ishmael's descendants in the united states right now sitting in the message of the hour who knows because remember ishmael and isaac physically never fought right but doctrinally they fought everybody understand that isaac had a promise he had rebecca and remember he that was a line promise but ishmael had a line that was promised but there would be a wild child so what i was trying to get you to see we can't throw the baby out with the bath water we can't throw ishmael out the ishmael type the type of ishmael is the type of the church not it not the nominal church i'm talking about the true church because remember he was abram seed everybody got the heat but he wasn't that galatians 3 16. not as two seeds as of many but as the one seed which is christ so so god wasn't even looking really at abraham and isaac down that line because remember christ didn't come from any of that christ didn't come from a natural lineage so you have to look at the spiritual language and that's what we're talking about wednesday night look at the spiritual lineage of of isaac which is i've got a promise i'm going to make it in the rapture but that's not the full promise god gave man put his own ideas in it right but when you come to where god met abraham there's your promise okay right there now that's why i read you that quote at the first word brother branham said every son of the faith and daughter will make this final journey i mean me this journey at the final end not the ishmael and not the abram and not the sarah not the contentious woman this right here this is what god promised you have got to meet melchizedek for yourself and you remember the quote that i read you that now melchizedek is in us not one person so you meet melchizedek every day if you meet born again believers amen you meet melchizedek which is god in human flesh now what are you if you're born again you're god in human flesh okay so that's what you're meeting that's why daddy's tommy we're not i think we're saying we'll well we'll meet him over there no here's where we meet him not in a physical form okay but we meet him in flesh in a physical form called a bride that's why melchizedek could not be the savior but yet what was inside of melchizedek was the savior right right the theophany that was in melchizedek that man that met abraham and looked at him eyeball album was the same one that got on the cross and died for your sins but it was just a different flesh because remember that flesh was created and took out of existence there's no way that we were that way he had to be our brother so melchizedek couldn't die for us but the one that was inside of him is the one that went to the cross to die for us because if he's got to if the redeemer the redeemer had to be somebody that went through the same thing you went through melchizedek never went through being a baby growing up dying on a cross no question it was just spoken in existence spoke out of existence but that man became jesus christ that theophany did one day remember how long it was from abraham to jesus another for 2000 years was born in flesh now he can say i was born like you but not born in sin but in other words i'm coming in type of you and your journey because the melchizedek we meet let me put it this way the milk question we meet is not exactly the same melchizedek abraham met because that milk has it hadn't been in flesh and died yet but in the mind of that man it already happened okay got it yeah because he was slain before the foundation of the world so god in his mind knew the whole plan but he had to come down here to fulfill that plan he couldn't stay god up there when i say up there i don't mean up there it's just right here you understand what i'm saying yes so he had to come here as a baby grow up be like me and you that way we he we can say hey that man was just like us because see if we said well melchizedek is our savior see you can have all kind of people out in the world say well we weren't born like him we didn't have nothing to do without them and see most denominational people don't believe that that was a person they don't they don't believe that's the person that abraham met they believe that's a priesthood because they call it the melchizedek priesthood but i mean the bible says without father without mother without ending of day's beginning of life it was a person but it wasn't something that was born because the bible specifically said without beginning of days or ending of life so that person had to be special but now remember that person became jesus christ they had a beginning bodily at the beginning and to take away the sin curse off of us he had to die and go by the grave and come up and then come back into uni melchizedek could not get into abraham there's no way melchizedek could get into abraham's soul but he was showing them a promise that hey abram i mean abraham your sons because remember i might not be physically the son of abraham but brother branham said abraham was the father of the united states of america i didn't read that quote but i got it in my book because the bible says he's the father of nations so he said abraham is the father of the united states of america now what's he talking about faith he's not talking about literal he's talking about faith he's talking about having faith the faith seed of abraham and it's not two seeds as of many but the one seed which is christ so you look at christ you see a many member body but it's one christ one jesus christ everybody got that so that's what we come to when we come to the final end it's not going to be that we're just going to be have part of the promise no we meet melchizedek and he changes our body that was the that's why brother brown said every son of the faith will make this same journey in the final end in the end time when we end this thing up it will have to be god changing our body from inside out see there's no way now what did what happened with abram abraham god changed his body on the outside got it but he didn't want that i don't want that god wants to dwell in your soul amen all right he wants that's where his children come from and so that's why abraham's not a child of god the bible says abraham's a friend of god the faith seat of abraham they're going to get eternal life but they're not going to get eternal life like you and i give eternal life because once we were lost and then god comes in and cleans our soul and resides with abraham he looked at a promise he looked at the sacrifice and he looked at calvary christ hadn't died yet that's why i said when melchizedek walked down that road to meet abraham you and i were in that man we were in the god of the man yes we were in that man when i say man i don't mean the outside man i mean be man because abraham said my lord he saw one man it was revealed to him that that was almighty god now queen and you just said he couldn't and i understand that he could not give his life for our salvation and is that okay because he didn't come through the womb of the woman that's correct right through the womb of a woman it was corrupted through the womb of the woman he had he cleaned that womb out when he came through now physically he didn't clean it out you understand what i'm saying so we got to go back to the spiritual part am i right we got to go back to the spiritual part he did not clean that woman when he came through as a baby it was a mess just like the rest of us but god in type showed that that was what got us in trouble and that's how we're going to get out of trouble god didn't just that's why i said god doesn't mel kevin that wasn't a kinsmen or melchizedek was not kin to anyone right now jesus christ wasn't kin to anyone either but he came the same way you and i came except for the virgin birth versus the sexual birth that we have but remember final end is the same thing it's a baby being born through a woman the correct way that's correct and see man showing it now by artificial insemination they take all kind of they take you know brother brown he said i love this statement he said he said i can uh he said i he said virgin birth he said that's easy he said a natural birth to me is a mystery millions of seed millions of millions of uh germs and or eggs coming together and how do you get here i have one go over the other one and 650 000 of them die in one lift to get you here to me that selection of the almighty it was real easy honestly it was it was easy for god to say all right here's the german here's some here's the egg here's the german i'm gonna put it in mary that was one and one that was pretty easy but to get me and you here it was a battle it wasn't for god but it was for us but he wasn't a kinsmen there's nowhere it says melchizedek he's a priesthood he's the one that is a priest what does a priest do a priest ministers right what was melchizedek doing he was ministering to abraham and very positive i will visit you so abraham was sitting there soaking this in and going man this guy's going to visit this guy being almighty god to me in abraham's mind that just settled everything and that's what should settle everything for you and i we're not going to meet melchizedek as that one person but we're going to meet him through a five-fold ministry actually first because there's your priesthood there's your fivefold there's your melchizedek priesthood apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists there's where you're going to get it from can't get it from anywhere else because it says for the perfecting of the saints all right so we come to a time to where we see then that abraham received the promise or was receiving the promise from melchizedek and then we saw what he'd done to sodom he said well there's my there's my brother's down there can you save them god said if you can find finn you know abraham says you can find 50. he said okay be fine 20. okay you can find 10. okay i won't destroy it if you can find 10 but there was only four and one of them was a mate believer you know lost wife but there was four down there that had to come out so god did protect that many people but he did not protect sodom once they got out sodom was burned but now let's let's go and continue on this journey because if every son of the faith got to do this at the final end then we got to act like abraham did not not some of the things that he did before and about laughing at god and all those things because remember he didn't have the new birth david david the things david did is because he leaned to his natural spirit and not the spirit of god we just read songs where where he actually comes down and speaks in the first person lest i dash my foot against the stone and all those things he was talking about christ but there was david that had his best friend killed committed adultery with his best friend's wife and had a child by which the child passed away but because david didn't have the new birth under the blood of bulls and goats that was covered that was covered and they had a prophet on the scene that made sure that that was covered remember nathan said you will not die you should die that's what nathan says that you you should die thou art the man david called the judgment said thou art the man and nathan said well you're the one who did it but you're not going to die god's going to preserve you because he saw the integrity of david's heart same way with abraham like i said wednesday i don't think abraham was some well look where he come from his father was an idol maker so he really probably didn't even believe in god he believed in gods and goddesses and whatever they had because his daddy was making idols and he was probably in the workshop helping his dad when a man spoke to him just out of the remember was a physical man the lord said to abram get up let's go you know what he got him went and through his journey of life he probably never thought that we'd be talking about him 4 000 years later and paul calling him the father of our faith but remember if you look in that old testament you see abram and abraham even abraham gave his wife away when it was abraham remember tried to all right but if you take paul and come through jesus christ and through the blood of christ you come over here to paul paul said he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief now we would we would stick him as an unbeliever in certain instances remember he laughed at god got down on the floor laughed physically laughed sarah just left in her heart but remember abram's name had just been changed he was just a baby as far as we call a baby in the statue of a perfect man he didn't have virtue he didn't have knowledge temper patience and all those things he didn't have knowledge because remember we read it wednesday night he fell on his face and laughed right after that he said oh that ishmael may walk before you he's leaning back toward ishmael again he was just a babe in christ just like you and i we make mistakes as a baby in christ but once we get brotherly kindness some of those mistakes need to be gone some of those little baby mistakes that we've been making should be out of here let's read a few of these before we go i know some of you can't see all that but i can't remember how i can't get this part off over here on the side anybody know how to do that bob's not and slide it over toward the side of the paper i'm trying all kinds of stuff anyway most of you can see that i'll read it so you'll know what it says this is statue of a perfect man but when you get down here a genuine born again dove then you don't have nothing it adds to you see comes on up all right coming into perfection now then sixthly let's add the bible said here adding brotherly love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right the sixth seventh all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brother kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me peter said shall i forgive him seven times a day jesus told him seventy times seven that's four hundred and ninety seven sevens is 49 490 years brotherly kindness now see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him you see what i was talking about the other day all these virtues come into play with brotherly kindness watch this somebody said not be kind to him now see there's one impatience so there's patience be kind to him go anyway somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god and the oneness all the rest then put zebra in the kindness see hoping someday look patience with him there's one virtue temperance that's true enduring with it knowledge that's three to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in your cell to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday god will bring him in so he's using all the virtues down at the bottom going up that pyramid and they all culminate in brotherly kindness because remember that's the last virtue until we get the love of god which is the headstone all right and listen 99.9 of the christians that have ever lived since the day of pentecost has not come to that love the lord jesus and william branham is the only two people on the face of this earth that has ever come to that capstone that we know that we know of the time that we can use for an example let's put it that way that we can use for an example that come to where that capstone came down over that man and god said hear you him so i don't want to be discouraging but that's a pretty bad batting average 0.01 but you know what there is a 0.01 it says for the perfecting of the saints so there is a way to get there and william branham got it besides being a prophet this is what i believe and you don't have to be a prophet to receive the headstone amen if not then we all got to either be prophets or we're not going to make it that's right so we're not so brother didn't make it because it was a prophet but mom said that prophet that prophetic gift of brother branham was sent here to straighten not the word out the word's always been straight but straighten the people out that had distorted the word okay so that's what that that that uh prophetic gift did sure we know it was signs and wonders but brother brown said that was just the bait on the hook that was just the healing ministries was just the worm right wiggling worm because there's a hook there you want to catch those fish you put that wiggling worm on there well that wiggling worm was signs and wonders not discrediting signs and wonders because that was a great thing since jesus christ they never was a man that produced as many miracles and produced more than jesus did brother brown said one in service he had as many miracles that jesus did so but that wasn't the message that had been ishmael come on that had been that had been the wild child of pentecost from pentecost till now that had been the gift that god had given people he wants us to take a body change that's his that's got if we don't take a body change then this thing keeps going on and on and he can't because this is the last church ages what i'm telling you we've come up to a walk we've come up to a wall there's no you know luther come up to a little wall but he knew he didn't know but god knew there was a wesley standing there to take the message and start a new then there was a pentecostal wall that wesley came up against and went over and went into the pentecostal age well now we're in laodicea there's no other wall we either going to hit the wall and go down or hit the wall and go up so there's our but our promise is that we're going to have that child there's our promise that's why every son of the faith and the final end will take this journey martin luther did not take that journey of meeting melchizedek and being changed and having a child everybody understand that's what i'm talking about wesley did not do that pentecost did not do that they produced a child but it wasn't the promised child from 63 to from let's just put it this way from 1963 after the seals open there's your promised child there's melchizedek meeting you face to face because it was a word not just a person it was a word and and god wanted us to take the body change is he is his thinking for lack of a better word it's his plan to get us back to like an eating perfect like a garden vegan perfect i mean before listen brother brown said this right he'll be sticky to the very end of the change what you're going to have to do is depend on what god's given you inside you no i mean after the body change well after the body yeah when we go i actually want that is exactly what i see what you're saying i'm sorry but yes remember we fell in eden yeah real quick we're gonna have to get out here this was eaten okay this was eaten this was in eve you and i remember all right we fell eden came with us nature nature found man found nature fell with it got it now when we go back man's got to go back to the eating condition first then the world comes with it right so we've got to take a body change to bring eden back up but it's not this this is the same thing because remember redemption is not replacement right the even condition was that you and i were going to be born in a flesh body that was eternal and we were going to live for an eternity no sinners no nothing but when we fell the earth fell with us we're all in a fallen condition the whole world is groaning romans 8 waiting on a manifestation of the boy sons of god back up to an eaten condition okay then the world's going to catch up with us in the millennium partly yeah remember partly in the millennium we'll have an eden-like condition not fully we'll have a city that the jews are going to build down here correct jews are going to build that city down here we're going to live in that city that's not the future home devil's still alive his demons are still alive when we get into that future home they ain't going to be no loud demon so we got to go back up let god clean the earth off kill the devil kill the death kill the spirits then we're going to come back into an eating condition just like it was and they're not going to fall that is redemption it is not replacement so we had to have somebody come that didn't fall but that was the type that's like the time absolutely yes that's archetype all right let's go we didn't get done with anything but we'll start again next time lord bless you no because somebody told me the other day if you'll look up those two words word last when sarah laughed and looked up the other word laughs they're two different words
