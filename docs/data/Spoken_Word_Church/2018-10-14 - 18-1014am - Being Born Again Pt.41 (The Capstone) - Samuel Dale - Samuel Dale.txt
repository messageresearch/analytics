========================================

and give me a heart last fear with love and me me like be amen good morning one blessing to be back in the house of the Lord we know that we are here because God loved us we know the Satan desire to stop all of us if he could nobody would be here but but God are blessed us or so while we're here let's enjoy and yield ourselves to his Holy Spirit we're gonna read this morning from first Corinthians chapter 10 you let's praise Allah father we are grateful and we're thankful that we have this privilege and opportunity to come together to worship Louis that you would just bless each and every heart father that has come that is present lo that we will have our spirits United one that we may draw from heaven the Holy Spirit we pray that whatever we have need but we will ye allow ourselves that you were blessed it and give it unto us yes you remember those that in Sunday School classes look father just be with them comfortable and give them strength they may yield unto you we actually beat brother there was morning and touch them in a special way give him strength Lord that which we have need of that you were blessing and that we received a revelation of it in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen first Corinthians we reverse 1 through 15 moreover brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and did all eat in the same spiritual meat but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents now all these things happen to them for examples that they are written for our admonition upon whom the hands of the world are come there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it I speak as wise man JG what I say God bless you visit the brothers in the pack praise the Lord Amen god bless god bless you this morning I trust everyone's doing well I'm gonna try not to take too much times take give time for the word amen praise God a few months ago this is a church that we've we've actually started helping out in Honduras about two years ago when I was there we helped start the process of this church building and this brother Eric Gallo who is the brother who we helped buy some tires for his truck or if you remember him this is his church but this is the church that they started this is the way it was pretty much in December last December when I left it and so I told brother Dale and I told some brother Wade and and we wanted to help them put a roof on the church because really I'm supposed to go down there in December help dedicate the building with them and but they said I listen all we need is a roof he never asked me for a month before money or anything I just wanted to help them out you know and so I asked brother Dale and and and then brother they of course asked you all and they've you all were in agreement so so if they could put but but the next slide this is how the way it looked pretty much when I left there in December go ahead next next next all right so when we sent them the money this is they immediately started the process of the putting the roof on the church immediately and I'll show you something at the end after in just a moment but brother Eric he's so he's so detailed with what he does and this is a brother that really he he shows what the money is being used for and I really really appreciate young brother really young brother but yeah he's very responsible so next next the money that we sent them he was able to have leftover also to be able to pay some of the workers for labour so that was wonderful amen next next all right so here I believe it's complete right there it's a metal roof and they were gonna go with a wooden type first but then that was gonna be a little bit too much more more money so they decided to go with metal and it was a little cheaper so everything worked out next this is the inside now they have a dirt floor but he said that's okay we can still have service there as long as there's a roof over our head so next next next in this church I've been there it's in the middle of nowhere pretty much so yeah very nice view if you go back that way that's that's it's another little town that's where they were actually meeting the town was called Agua Blanca and they were meeting in a loss in a sister's house which I'll show here in just a moment next next all right so this is this is actually when he gave me the this is the the the materials and things that they were gonna buy and he said brother Luis we actually made it to in the name of spoken word Church at the top so the everything that the whole thing is actually made out and spoken word church amen and you know I didn't ask him to do that he just did that and that is uh is in their money yeah that's in their money and I believe in their money which is uh impede us is Colin Peters it's about 23 and Peeta's to a dollar that's how that's how their money is next next and that's the whole thing there was some other there was some videos there I don't think everything was shown here there it is okay all right this is a sister the sisters house that they were they were but I don't know they got the volume up or not all right she's she's saying thank you very much for the offering that was given she said I really appreciate you all supporting us and she said I want to see sister Christine brother Lewis again and when they come we'll have coffee ready for them and they said but we really appreciate you all and we are praying for you is what she says amen and this is another sister at the church they're just saying she wants to thank for the offering that was given for the offer for the church and then now we have a little place that we can actually call a church we take things for granted Saints we have these air conditioner and buildings and all these things and these people just with a building with just a roof on their head they're they're satisfied with that amen and this is one more so he's saying the same thing thank you very much for the offering that you was given to the for the church so that's pretty much it and I thought that those that those what I was going to show at the end was those two where the materials was being bought but I had that it I had that sort of at the beginning but I thought that was interesting that he did that you pray for them and pray for us the Lord willing we'll be there in December we got all of us are gonna be going this time my wife my daughter's want to give them an experience I believe I believe it'd be good for them you know I believe young people that it'd be nice for them to get out there in third world countries and see what things are really like because sometimes we take for granted what we have here you go to those places and be like wait a second things are there's things that are more important than just that you know then looking at yourself you know so a man you pray for the people and pray pray for us god bless you all [Applause] the stand amen amen appreciate that brother movies yeah we know that there is a great need in the world like that in the countries but a little bit of traveling I've done you learn a lot when you go so just pray for them that the Lord would bless them and take care of them and you know and help them along the way all right we are to going to start helping them financially but now not helping I want this understood he doesn't want any money to come to him for his financial life I don't know the best way to say it but he does a lot of traveling he does a lot of missionary traveling so what we're going to do is start sending to them the Lord willing this month or ever when they get it set to send to them like a hundred and fifty dollars a month that's not a lot of money but it does or without it helps and gives them an opportunity to do and that way he can travel more and feel more free on his traveling so you know just remember that just pray the Lord would bless we're glad to have all of our visitors with us today and we say to you welcome you've come here one time your visitor two times you're part of us so you know we appreciate you coming and being with us and prayer the Lord would bless you now you remember the announcements remember the festival will be on the 27th so remember that and just keep that in in mind and then to remember that the fellowship meeting will be at brother Tony's next month you know they say I'm not getting loud enough or something okay alright but it'll be at brother Tony's next month so remember that any other announcements that we have we are we generally miss something but anyhow so let's turn to our scriptures in first Peter that we've been at for quite a while and right not this coming Wednesday he will be here the next Wednesday ministering for us and then taking a couple of days off hunting and all so to remember that all right father we thank you for this day in your grace and your love Lord we thank you for all things and we just ask you Lord to guide each one of us and dine understanding that we may walk in the light of your grace we praise your great name and just honor you Lord with all that we could honor and father just to see pictures of these places that they don't have anything but to see this a few dollars will help them to be able to at least be in out of the weather and the things and and they can do a lot Lord with what little bit we can send and we ask you to just bless and guide each one you know the needs around the world and just that's your life shine in our hearts remember all the sick among us member the island sister Anna there today and just be with them it open our hearts that we may see you we love you in Jesus name first Peter verse 22 23 seeing ya purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever I know you they didn't give it to them but we'll just bypass that one and go to one more scripture that's very familiar with all of us in the message revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word try to pick up where we were Wednesday and make sure that we're understood and just rain to the thought you know and keep our hearts and minds in in to the area that we're talking about but I like that scripture called it said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound well the reason I love it so much because it separates people that separates time it separates all of the things to work that we can follow the day in the hour that we're living all right now we believe that God sent us a prophet that's the part we do believe you know and we honor that part to believe in that he sent a prophet to us all right but to send a prophet remember if he just sends a prophet without a message that would be contrary to Scripture code it always in the Bible all the way through when a prophet comes on the scene he may have a judgment you know he may have a condemnation called it always is it would be put to that point you know that he'd bring down and it's always been a judgment to a nation when a prophet comes to that nation all right but also remember now even though you you think about the judgment of all of the things of a prophet coming to that nation that being condemned but also remember he's not just coming to condemn alright oh that's that's the point I want you to follow with me through the the message this morning that it's not to say well you know see we think about well god sent a prophet down here and he brought her judgment to that people but why did he send that prophet why did he send him I mean he just said well they said him to judge them you know the condemned woman all I can't now there was always somebody there at that position our place our country our dear they would always a group of people there too receive a message these so then his message would not be just see we think of right around him we say oh he just come to condemn America well that's true but remember that I've always tried to say to you he sent him to America because he knew one time there was not a place in the world that a prophet could go and do what this prophet has done all right are you following me how do you see when he sent him to America he sent him where the money would be for number one all right they would be money in America and we know neither sending him to to China or some country or anything like that to and expect a backup of that you know in any way to help and and you know to have the money to be able to support it came to America if that's just one point now listen we'll get to the other second he sent him to America because he knew there would be people here that we would have the financial ability to be able to send this message to the world all right so it's all not just judgment that's what I want you to to think about it's not just judgment because of sin and the profit that's true I mean there it is a point that he judge the nation is judged all right but it's still true that a point that were the nation should be great and like i said financially the message came to america we had the ability to and still how to be able to send this message to the world what if it to come to some of the other countries what if you were living in some of the countries that i've even been in to her you know the economy was so poor until you know i mean the poor little kids in jamaica when i went during 93 it amazed me to see that that what we call today in our schools when you're going a little special trip you know that you'd take it with the kids and care them on a little little trip out you know what a trip in Jamaica was you know what school trip in Jamaica was to go to a McDonald now not to get nothing to eat they didn't take him there on our little school trips for them to get somebody just to go and walk through the place and how would you like to have been born like that what if we were born in these foreign countries instead of being born where we're at alright so get the point now so then that makes it to where that there's many things to consider but then the next part is to one thing the bride of America now not it we're the only part of the bride this all the way around the world but the bride in America would be able to put the money forth to do the financial work the printings are doing and the Bible tells you know that that it was needed that that be done and then you could send the message around the world but what about a wonderful opportunity that you and I have that the message came to America it came to our part and we have the ability to to read it and study it in and all like that because it's a wonderful opportunity your to consider that but see then I caught it said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to Sion but now remember financially it helps everything like that but remember when a prophet comes he brings a message there's always a message that'll follow all right see then that's why it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel alright there's a message to come for you so well yeah we believe that but do we have it in the correct order of understanding because if we don't we'll get it massively confused see you got to get it lined up to work that the scripture then will declare who we are what we are what he's brought to us what's taking place all right so we can see the financial part is going we've done that we've seen it we've had the ability to do that all right but now what is the message like one country said you know better said you've told us about the prophet but said now tell us what he taught now see this message was a Gentile prophet which meant it would go to the entire world right it would be just to America the message would be to the entire world all right because that would bring it forth and it's to bring a people is to follow this message and that's what we'll get to in a minute to try to just to continue on what we were talking about Wednesday night of not in the years of preparation but when he begins to say on what about it what about the sounding of this endtime message to work that we could see Jesus Christ living among us and that a wonderful thing to think about to see and realize this message is the entire message there's not another message to come there's not another time or anything happening it's this message that would come forth to bring us the the understanding to bring a lot of things to an end to where that we could rejoice in what we've seen I rejoice in what I've seen so far but I'm looking forward to a change of the body I'm looking forward to many things that's in the message this problem to us alright but yet I mean I'm happy about what has been sent but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel see there's got to be a voice to have a messenger sent what good is the messengers in if he doesn't have a voice or if he's so far behind he can't understand you remember there in the Bible one time it always kind of tickled me but you remember in the Bible one time they would get out turn they was fighting and and everything and they wanted the king and all to get word or what back in the country you know so this man says well all right let me go they said no he said you don't know what to tell him so we got this one ready got everything to tell him you know yeah and I won't let me go then he said well let's go well he just took off running you remember the prophet rut called it running without a message go see when the guy got there he didn't know what to tell him when he come running in and asked him said what is this what did that he said I don't know all i know i don't know well said Disko said I am uh-huh was he finally come the guy that had run that had the message well I we heard a lot of messages across the land there's a lot of things that people have said but worth the message we thank God for people like all Roberts Billy Graham the great people that brought the flames in their day and things like that but where's their message well their message is Jesus Christ living yeah but what is their message what does it take you to and the profit I'll give it to you in a minute the kind of paraphrasing where the Prophet said it like this he said you know if we we think that we're in the end time then there is a message to be brought where's the message if he didn't bring it where's it to be all right what is the message he said well the message is this that now what is the message this profit brought us a message for the end time what is that message right what do you think about this message I believe it's Hebrews 13:8 I believe it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right I believe that's what the message is but yet to stay in the profit is saying to stay with the same message that you've brought he said the signs and wonders even following it you take signs and wonders and all like that going forth and you stay with the same message what good is it there's always a progressive in your message it's never to standstill all right you say well what do you mean by that all right what if what if it started happening what are you going to say about these churches around the land that denominational churches and people that are having great moves great signs and wonders are taking place among a lot of the religious world are you gonna say that's of God if it's any form to her that it would be of God we could say yes we believe it's of God but what about the message see if they're gonna take us back to the same old Trinitarian ideas they don't matter about the signs and wonders that's where the end time is going to be so deceiving because those things are going to start happening signs and wonders will start happening around the world very shortly from now I don't know how long and he never been no worry to me about how long but I've always said it happened could have always believed it we're not gonna run out of here and in this thing up with just how glory hallelujah we're in the rapture we're goin home you know no there's got to be something take place and we're in the very hour that those things now can start transpiring you let these things start tightening down just a little bit on us you let the that the part happening of that we know that in our that we're living in what is what the world is capable of you let that start happening and when you do you're gonna get serious right when you get hungry you get serious well brother Taylor you thank you that we go that's what your prophet say it now right that's what he said about it so then we stay with what he had to say about it he wasn't a doomsday preacher that's what I mean so he knew that with the fact that it would be if the enemy comes in he knew the Bible said what that the spirit would raise up a standard I'm not worried about it I'm not concerned with it I mean if they come in here right now and close us out close down take your homes do everything what are you gonna do well they can't do that we're in America oh don't life so much they can take anything they want to any time they want to the grace of God is what's keeping us to this day right and see then that that goes with the message because we've got to become the very message to talk about a message that a prophet Brian it's wonderful we've sent it to the world we've educated the world with this message until ever nice and had it everybody has it everybody in the world had an opportunity to this message now through one form or the other see we've educated them as I say into that but still have we taken it that to our hearts to what it is do we really believe that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel then it says the mystery that doesn't say mysteries are reaching Bible that says mystery singular because there's just one mystery and that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the mystery all right that's all that it takes all the mysteries to make that mystery manifest that's why it says in the days of the voice he's got one message to bring you remember the Prophet he said not in the in the years we'll read it in a minute in the years of preparation but when he begins to sound a message your prophet knew that when he brought this message to America that it would be a condemnation to the land as I said a moment ago but at the same time there's a group of people to receive it it's not condemnation to those that receive it come on this message is not that's what I've always heard the ministers preached they preached a damnation message maybe you call it her condemnation message are downing the people for what they are it's not gonna do no good you could say all you want to it's not gonna change it you're not going to change the people of the world by preaching any form of a doctrinal priest Jesus Christ and let him be made manifest I got so tickled the other day I just really liked I'm not one to preach on this and that of closed line type of do I believe in it I believe in living right and doing right but I believe in because you're the new birth is there and I'd priest not preach nothing you know to say anything about it for a long time and I I just mentioned it in the message the next Sunday I saw manifest by somebody here the fact that it wouldn't don't change anything they wasn't gonna change anything for me do that someone do it you don't believe in living right no I don't believe in living right I don't I believe in being born again and that'll take care of it you get born again it'll take care of the higher the dress the clothes the me and the thing it'll take care of that if we get born again that was what the Prophet was bringing to us he was preaching Jesus Christ you said yeah but he hollered out about this and hollered out about that sure he did cause he was a messenger to the world his message went to the entire world so he had to condemn all right but to the bride he said you don't have to tell her but one time that's what he's saying he says you don't have to tell her but one time since she line up why because it's Christ in you there's the day that we're living and the message is being sounding for the Prophet brought us a message it was a message of salvation it was a message of deliverance we've tried our best to explain for 40 something years about the end time and the way it is that you you might as well forget trying to convert the world you can't do that it's only those that are convertible is the ones that's going to be saved see that's the message the Prophet brought the Prophet brought us a message to let us realize who we are as I said sure he condemned the world okay he's a judgment to the world right but he's not a judgment to the bride this message is not judgment to the bride this message is a release this message is to bring us to a position to see who we are and by realizing who we are it will take care of the rest of it the words the preachers preaching who we are they want to preach about what this is what that is no see get born again that's the message we need to begin to sound he preached in his early ministry to try to turn us back to the faith of the father's right because that was Malachi 4 was to bring the message to turn us back to the faith of the fathers that we could see Jesus Christ living among us but you see that's what all the people can receive they can receive that but they think that's what they think see then they think well you know it's just dress and closing huh all that is wonderful if you're born again but you can have you can have your address dragged into tracks out and the hard dragging that out that ain't gonna convert you but to get the revelation of Jesus Christ into your soul will take care of the hair and the dress and conversion - that's the message that has been brought this message was not as I say I won't that point it was not a condemnation message that's what it's been talk to the people that's all it's been talk to the people this condemnation it's not condemnation it's deliverance its deliverance to set us free from ourselves our own ideas and our thoughts of what we are what if you get everybody to start shouting glory hallelujah and all kind of thing you said brother Dale you wouldn't love to see this world and a resort yeah I'd love to but I know it's not gonna do it right I know it's not going to do it so why am I worried about it I'm concerned with the voice that goes with the man that brought the message we preach brother Branham was a prophet but remember the point that I've made to you drove it hard on this one I'll Drive it again he didn't come to condemn it's condemnation to those who will not accept but it's deliverance to those who will accept it sets free one group of people while it binds another group right see that's what it is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we'd learned the truth we'd learned the truth of what a gulf sent for it wasn't sent to condemn is sent to a bride to let her realize who she is and to be gathered together in that word of the hour that we're living seem to get us born again get us to a place to where we can see Jesus Christ see we can bring down the things and and that's what we were doing the other day see the Prophet was bringing a point of a message you know and he said we do this we do that but he said about the revelation of Jesus Christ in other words what has happened to the end time people have they been set free by the message or is it becoming more condemnation is it becoming more binding that's worth it I've never tried to teach anything to bind anybody to any point because it'll do no good like you you sure funny I know I am because that's what I say you said you're not trying to get people safe no because I know I can't do it I know that I cannot save you from anything the Prophet couldn't save you from anything it takes God to do the saving and see then his message was sent to the bride the others it goes in it because of the ways and thought but the message was sent to the endtime bride then let us know who we are and what we're here for the set us free you don't think like that do you think well I always thought this message was just you know was a judgment it is to those who reject it but to those who receive it it's not a judgment it's a freedom it's not a freedom to go live like the devil that's not that way it's a freedom to realize that God has paid the price and sent a message he's given us a message we've come up to the inner statue of a perfect man we've come up through all of the virtues and the things coming out and we're now striking to the point of love now love is a lot different than what we think we know it's not to Phileas or not just that in the other no charity is love see do you love God because he corrects you my dad died when I was 4 years old I can't ever say I remember him spanking me I wish I could because you know what I know what he would be doing it for to help me to try to help me to live right and do right do you honor your parents because of they come on children because they correct you you get all upset and all everything because of correction what do you want no they're trying to save you they're trying to to help you to try to get you to live right and do right they're trying to get you to see Jesus Christ but do you understand what I'm driving at because it it's what I was trying to get across Wednesday night we'll get back to the point of to it later to her that brother branham's message never begun in the forties and times that was doing what God had told him he was supposed to do returned the hearts or the children back to the faith of the father all right but we fail to see as I said when over and over and we'll go back over but we fail to see the key that he told him their own Ohio River want your message will forerun the second coming where's the message where's the message to forerun the second coming well we've got it it's the message but what part of it is for us because I can stand here and preach your condemnation condemnation message and say that's what the Prophet taught and read it to you what is that the message that's the message to those who need condemnation yeah what was his early ministry back there when he was preaching those things and weren't even now you don't like this but even the Prophet himself taught era in his early ministry because light had not shined on the truth he talked to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost until he was straightened out by the Lord later on by the opening of the word see I was just trying to get a point across to us Wednesday of worth it can we see the difference between his early ministry when he was bringing his message to the people and they're returning back to the faith of the fathers and then to see the opening of the word to come the opening of the word until it would come to work that he would bring us the message of deliverance he said well I thought the whole message was was this message what are you talking about I'm talking about truth he was sent to do two things one to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father 327 church AG book 2 to reveal the seven thunders which is revelation contained in the seven sealed it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back when did his message begin he said not in the years of preparation well I don't get you what you mean it was the message of returning back the faith of the fathers it was jaws promise I will restore Joel never brought a restoration of the new birth the new birth has been in every age every age had the new birth I wasn't restoration you remember Wednesday the capstone to cap it all off to take us in a change and all that's not restoration that was never here Jesus was rejected he become according to the scriptures the head of the corner well because that's all they could do at that time yet he was the one who you know he brought the message the Prophet brought the message but have we been able to go on into the message to see what he told are we still playing around with our ideas or thoughts I've been preaching for months about this trying to get us to see one thing if everybody's I said if everybody in the world was standing with the faith of the fathers do you listen to what I'm trying to say that's not his message that was a foundation to be able to bring his message that was not him sounding forth the mysteries the mysteries come from the seals and going home throughout the message to bring us the message of eternal life but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to silent when he begins to declare his message wind is brought around him to start declaring his message well he was declared all alone my steward but that ain't the understanding that won't fit in what he was saying how many things do we need to read from the Prophet about that brother Branham knew he was going to have a message you remember what we were bringing out Wednesday night according to spoken words of regional seed when he brought his message down the Lord he said Lord I got him out on the limb because he brought him to the faith of the fathers read the message or listened to it and the Lord told him said as of yet Malachi fours not fulfill 1962 spoken words original see said Malachi 4 is not full for him because there was more to Malachi 4 than to just turn our hearts to the faith of the fathers it was to bring the revelation of the entire word and see as it does then he was to bring a message your message the Holy Spirit said will forerun the second coming in other words really put it in plain language your message will be the second coming is that a better way of putting it can you follow that line he was literally being told that his message was going to turn the hearts back yes but that it would come forth and be the very coming of the Lord Jesus can we believe it like that but you see what about the Prophet talking about he said this is the introducing what was his message to do it was to introduce Jesus Christ it was to introduce the Messiah look how hard the Prophet preached to all they down to but then the message that he had was to take us further on Kampala never told anything about to change other than you be change the moment the twinkle of an eye but nobody won't start to make that manifest right come on they couldn't make it manifest see there has to be something else take place and that something else takes place in this day where you and I are living think about it we've heard the message but have we heard the message that the Prophet bro or have we just heard words like I said I heard that brother say it that this country said it did you've told us about the Prophet now tell us what the Prophet taught well he told the disciples taught that but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery would be finished see we've got to go on to a change of the body we've got to go on to many things it's not just to haphazardly sit around and wait we've got to move on in him to where we can see those things and remember what I was trying to bring in we instead like trying to do God a service without it being his wheel the 7th angels and this is not when he starts out doing this well when he begins to sound his message not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message the mysteries would be revealed when he begins to sound his message but Ron's message then was not just to condemn it was to bring us the full world not just ideas or thoughts see because listen to what this says off of the message having to do is he trying to do God a service that would be in his will what's the doctrine of the Bible what's the message that follows them signs like I said what if you get out of here now and you get to seeing all these people and the world I'll start having great signs and wonders what are you gonna do what are you gonna stand on listen to what he says what's the message that follows them signs still the same the old school of message forget it what about signs and wonders what's going to happen one day when the thing starts happening around the world and you start seeing signs and wonders among the people what are you gonna do I'm gonna check out their message and I'm going to quote that what if you go on with that same message there's another quote to that too if you go on with that same simple message part without it moving on into deeper depth he said forget it they probably right understood at a wonderful place during 1962 that he had preached what the Apostles had preached he said I preached what they did what they and they all that was beyond the curtain of time remember the people in that was rejoicing about it and said we're dependent upon that but then the Lord said as of yet that's your not true what did he do he began to hunt for the message that God was trying to bring and as he was doing it what does he do revelation 10 says that in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth the message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service what does he mean Ian would it be wonderful to see the great days of the Prophet and the healing services that he had some of you were witnesses to those things right it was wonderful wasn't it what do you want that back or do you want the message mmm now we're striking on something a lot of people would like to have the days of the Prophet back did you understand him when he was here not in these years of preparation continuum number six and he promised in the hour of the seven angels message the seven seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound the message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service everybody wants the signs and wonders they wanted to profit you've heard him tell that right they gladly accepted Jesus when he was here healing the sick casting out devil but when he began to say I and my father one they was glad to hear brother branham right oh yeah great prophet but when he began to preach his message what happened was his message to just condemn them to tell them they were wrong like we can go to all of that alike where Pentecost fail and he say this is where you fail this worry is that all he was to brain or was he talk bring the opening of the word that light had never shined on before you see the disciples never preached the seals come on they never preached to see you it was not open to them they never preached about the Son of Man sure Matthew Mark Luke and John is writing about it go that's writing about war taking place but words any other than either their message or Paul or any of them that spoke of anything about the seals and about the what was the prophets message as I said to start with was it the basis of the Prophet being a condemnation was you listening was the Prophet a condemnation to a nation or a condemning to a world to be sent oh yeah yeah that's part of it yeah but did he not bring to the people an opportunity of salvation that had never been brought they did not bring forth to them what happened when when who what it went down you know and he said under the juniper tree oh he wanted to he wanted to kill everybody cause he understand his message either God had to put him through a whole lot of things when he did he come out there different relevance message was not just a condemnation message it was a deliverance message but when he entered the opening through the seals and get everything going look what he come to go ahead the number seven there's a messenger above and a messenger on the earth all right the seven angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry didn't when he began to sign forth his ministry not when he started out Jesus when he started out but he lived his evening oh that was great well when you begin to stay on my father one what happened would brought around him oh yeah they wanted him but him he began to say and he made this statement went on hello he said when you begin to say I and my father one and these other things he said Satan will come after you in other words he'll he don't like him what is it what is the message what I thought that is nothing see I'm trying to get you to define the message to see where the message lathes and what it brings and when did it start see he didn't start the message in his early ministry no really brought around his message began in 1963 until then it was a restoration until then it was turning back to the faith of the Father then he began to bring his message the opening of the seals was his message the years of preparation look what was he saying it's getting Lices I can read it off her but go ahead with number nine on the wings there was no white though I love this one let's read it off of her to get where you'll see what he's talking about look at what he's talking about he's explaining where this message come from already been here just exactly what the vision said that the next message would come forth bye-bye what now let's read it now I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards the heavens and started praying I heard a voice come out of the top of the rocks there said what are you leaning against over your heart I raised back like this my bare shoulders naked from a waster hot I look back and there was wrote in the quartz in the stone white eagle look just exactly what the vision said that the next message was come forth his message was not to just come in condemn ination his message was not to come and and just try to restore us back to the faith of the father all that's well and good and we needed but what is his message to come to do the unveiling of God pillar fire peering visible among us identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount Sinai remember before the true message come forth Moses priests and led them out of Egypt this prophet preached and led to people out from denominationalism into the faith of the fathers but just not to finish of it this message is to bring Jesus Christ personally to you and me it's not to condemn us fine all right so you don't understand me when I say that he didn't come to condemn cuz that's all you've ever been taught all you've ever been taught by the ministers is that this message is condemnation it condemns this it condemns advocate ends is when I just condemn with a I just his message was not condemnation his message was revelation his message was restoration to bring back what the Apostles taught yes to teach it until that would be so perfect until Paul would have been pleased to stood there when the Prophet was bringing those things but to realize that Paul and him never made it that's why in Hebrews 11:4 it it says day without us cannot be made perfect Paul and then noticing the grave is waiting on you and me to do what to get into the message and find out what this message is really about you don't understand what I'm saying but listen to the wording at least this message is not this condemnation this message is not to try to make us dress right and live right you're funny preacher cuz I thought all preachers want people to live right I don't want people to live right I want people to get born again and then live in or take care of yourself do you understand that get born again it'll take care of itself right see because it's not what we think it is it's not judgment sometimes it's it's to bring us the sounding of the seventh angels messages to deliver us from all things that's why I've asked you to do it I've asked you to just do one simple thing go home take the book of the titles of the sermons of brother Branham after 63 we're going to get into those things but show me one thing after 63 this a condemnation message unveiling of God mighty God unveil who is this melt resident future home across the mystery just read the titles things that ought to be just read the titles and you'll see what I'm talking about then go back and read the titles of the early ministry why did it brother branham preached over Christ the mystery of God revealed why did he preach that he had always preached one god but he'd always preached it as Jesus Christ me in the mystery no its Christ is the mystery and what did he say he said if you don't see now watch it he didn't say if you don't see Jesus and ever verse one decide he said if you don't see Christ in ever verse 57 he preached over and over and over that Melchizedek was Almighty God I wanted he preached another message after the seals bro but look at what he said after the seals preach he preached who is this melchester day he preached who he was by current 57 right he preached who is this melchester day no children occurs God in human flesh he's talking about and bride for him take two messages home and listen to them together listen to the unveiling of God and watch how much he lays down who that God is one didn't get the next message he preached not too long after then the mighty God unveiled and see if he ain't talking about you see that's what I'm saying that the people are not seeing the message they're seeing the the point of faith the fathers are seeing something like that or are following their own ways and ideas and just come down with it being a condemnation instead of coming to a point that he's he's showing who you really are what you're doing here is that the statement the Prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said she'll be an invincible army what about it what about it what do you think the message is well it's just telling us about Jesus I thought the Bible was to reveal the mystery of God the Apostle Paul preached a message talking about the revealing of the mystery and you know what he said that mystery was he said it was the engrafting of the Gentiles the engrafting of the Gentiles into the kingdom now that's a great mystery because he you don't have anything like I said on the other night all you've got is a speaking of it here Rahab the harlot you got this one here you got David with his mighty men you know that justice speaking of it just the types of it showing the Gentiles would come into the kingdom but when Jesus came he knew what he was doing and he didn't pick the hole that the children of Israel he came to it own it own received him not to them that receive him he gave the power to become sons of God there's Peter James John and all of those palling in but who did he really come after and that little woman said yes Lord you're right they said that dogs eat the chrome from the master's table he said I found no faith in Israel who was she a Gentile and that man said you don't have to do anything I'm a man of authority you just speak the word and my server to be healed he said go home he found him well did a Gentile see Paul knew there was a mystery of the Gentiles in grafton that mystery would bring it to the basis it that he would finally have to go be the messenger to the Gentiles but do we see it like that what do we see this message to me what is salvation to you well I don't do this I don't do I don't lie don't cheat it on steal praise God but tell me that word saved anybody show me where your good works have never saved anybody now let's get back to Paul we was the other night when Paul said therefore leaving the principles of doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of dead works you know if you're living right is a wonderful opportunity and a great thing but if it's not from the inside it's nothing but dead works its carnal reform ain't no the dead works but if you're living by Christ from the inside - let him take over then you have deliverance perish the prophets message it will take us all the way to the change of these bodies what's going to change these bodies go to one the opening of the word when the bride realizes who she is but what is it Church what is the entire message I thought it was the revelation of Jesus Christ and I thought by being the revelation of Jesus Christ that that Jesus Christ would be what would convert in us and not we ourselves what you see you can't try to tell people truth you try to get something to them about it and they just freeze up on you because they can't follow what you're talking about can you follow the simple statement that I might I don't want my kids to be good I wanted to be born again I don't want a church to be good the world can do that I want a bunch of born-again believers because if I get a bunch of born-again believers I ain't got to worry about them being good look you know what they're gonna rip out who they are and what's taking place and they'll be that because of what God has given them you ever thanked him for saving you well no brother deal cuz I don't do this I don't do that well what about when you didn't do it what about when you did do it is it deliverance or is it works is it salvation as this message brought salvation or has it brought condemnation barbaric what about the revelation of Jesus Christ in you as the Prophet said Christ the minister God revealed what is the new birth he says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you the growth development of the statue of a perfect man is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you it's not something you can attain yourself because there's no way to attain it you've got to let him have it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when are we gonna really get down to understanding what the Prophet brought to you and me he brought us a revelation of Jesus Christ that mankind had never been able to try to bring the best they could do was the fossils and things that brought the faith of the fathers but what about it do you have salvation or do you have a book of rules that you live by have you been delivered from things like brother con fob bush this was back before he ever heard of the message part of it I remember that but he wanted to quit smoking and so he prayed well when he told me what his prayer would I said man they no way in the world you could have prayed anything any better he could have begged and screamed and hollered until he just fell over David trying to get God to take care you know what he prayed he said Lord take away the need and the desire he had it covered on ever Avenue that could be he said take away the need and the desire and he was immediately delivered from smoking they did smoked probably most of his life you ever prayed like that I thought God they know better what prior to could be pray anything you have need of getting rid of this ask God to get rid of the need and the desire and don't quit cause you asked him one time that don't work because he knows you're not sincere come on musicians think on these things what is the message the Prophet came to Bryan well it's survival is a but what I what's the message of the Bible what is it about this Bible that mankind has not been able to follow a simple message read Hooper he remember most of you then we come here and during that time that Jim Jones thing had happened out there with a or down younger guy in our it was you know all those people that killed herself and they asked Fred one day said the Sam ever won't ever try to get you to kill yourself he said ever service he preaches that's all he preached it said he wants me to die he got the four I'm glad I didn't have to do the poison yeah but he got the point of what we need cuz that's what we need right what do we got left Stan let's sing so of course I think on these times you were born for the valley oh the sky let you try [Music] or your spirit boys [Music] let's
