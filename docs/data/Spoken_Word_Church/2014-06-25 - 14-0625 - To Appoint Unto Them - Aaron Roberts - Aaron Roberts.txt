not here tonight whatever the needs may be and Lord we just pray that you be with them watch over and protect us and Lord we just give you all the praise the honor and glory for it in Jesus Christ's name amen Isaiah 61 verse 1 says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the meek unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to it proclaimed acceptable year of the Lord and the day events of our God to comfort all that mourn to point unto them that morning Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of Joy unto mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen amen you may be seated speak a little y'all just pray for him speak a little thought it's called to appoint unto them which is from verse 3 there says to a to a point unto them that mourn in Zion and we know that in the scripture you know Jesus Takes this the same scripture in Luke chapter 4. and Brother Anderson if you want to bring bring that up because Jesus brings out something and we know that the the main point that we usually emphasize when we look at chapter four is that Jesus stopped in the middle of the verse because they only spoke of his first coming and then he stopped because what referred to the second coming he did not read but he said he said and there was delivered unto him the book of isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel The Good Tidings the gospel unto the poor because he has sent me to heal which says to bind up he said to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives now when we go back to when you go back to Isaiah Isaiah says to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the catheters and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord but but Jesus when he comes to speak about this he he comes in and he says and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and one of the things when you go back to see what he was talking about because Isaiah says that he says it's the opening of the prison to them that are bound but when you go back to what Jesus was saying because Jesus understood what was what was to be said because he was the one that was speaking originally to Isaiah because but when he said that it was not because they used the word prison but actually a better a better word to be used was a dungeon because you're coming out of Darkness because when they were bound they were in darkness and that's reason he was saying not that they were blind but they lacked light was what he was what he was getting at because the recovering of sight to the blind because you can't see when it's dark and because they were Bound by darkness and so now it's recovering of the sight because they had light because he was the light because that's what John when John Won that's what he said that he came that he was the light that he was John said that he spoke of the light that was to come and so he was the one that was to illuminate and so he said that he has anointed me to preach for the recovering of sight to the blind and he said and to set at Liberty them that are bruised so that's what he came to do because that was the point and so in Isaiah when when he speaks of being in a prison he's actually speaking of a dungeon because they were Bound in darkness but now was to come into light because uh even the scripture tells us you know we come out of Darkness into Marvelous Light because that's what the gospel was to do and you know one of one of the things that I want to speak about is in verse 3 here in Isaiah 61 where he comes in he says he have to a point unto them that are Bruce so he he comes and he speaks of of being anointed man many times people speak on being anointed but I want to speak on what he what he appointed to them and many times in the scripture you can look up the word a point and a point makes means to make a decision but the word a point here has a has a greater meaning to it and and I was started looking through some of the scriptures that speak about um being appointed a point unto them these things well the word appoint and I think Brother Anderson has this here it is the great lexicon to a point he says to put sit lay put lay upon lay violent hands on to set direct toward to extend compassion figurative to set ordain establish found a point constitute make determine fix to set station put set in place plant fix fashion work bring to pass a point give set make for a sign to be set right right so when he said that he to appoint unto them he didn't he didn't make a decision because when he goes back through the scripture he's not making the decision he's actually given them something because he's actually said to give to you these things because it's not just a decision because when you go back through the scriptures when you go through all the way through the scripture from the beginning in Genesis 2 8 is one of the first scriptures you you find this he said that he put the man in the garden because he created The Man Out of the Dust and he set the man in the in the garden and that was it's the same word and you go through all through the scriptures and it's what God is doing it's not what somebody else is doing but it's what God is doing so when he goes to a point unto them these things it's what God is doing it's not what what we have done just like it brother Branham said in and uh invisible the invisible Union of Christ he said Hallelujah now notice he said you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky right he said you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew before the foundation the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on a book what a Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God so it was unmerited favor but it was what God done it wasn't what we done it's what he done and then and you know going on to the adoption series brother Ram said in 1962 he said I don't live true to my wife because I think she divorced me I lived true to my wife because I love her he said it's a legal position that we have taken that we love one another first before it could be there it had to be a love I love her although I believe if I'd done something wrong she'd forgive me still I wouldn't do it anyhow I love her he said that's the same way with Christ I live he said I'm 50. if I live to be 90 or 100 have another 50 years of preaching I never preach a time go down and sit on the river I'm saved anyhow God saved me by his grace unmerited of anything that I ever could do did do or anything else I preach because I love him and I love his people he said and Ah that's the reason I know I've passed from Death unto life because that I love him and I go after them no matter what kind of condition they're in I go after them anyhow go get them anyhow pull them anyhow if ministers disagree and others disagree and denominations disagree that don't stop me there's something it didn't stop him he come right in the midst of unbelief and it didn't stop him he moved right on anyhow that's what we do go out and get them catch them anyhow no no matter reach grab hold on with all your might you don't know who they are save them that's because of love not because that I have to because I love because you love man so it's because of what he's done it's not what we've done it's not we what we could do yeah and I'm so thankful for that because there's nothing in in us that's any good or anything that we can do it ourselves but it's only by his grace that we're able to be anything in this life of what God has given us because it's unmerited favor but if so continuing on here when we see when he talks about being appointed having having these things to appoint unto them and when we look at the word appoint not only we see but all the things that that God has has uh said in the scripture one of the other types that that you find where brother uh where this comes out in the is in the message is uh in the scripture rather is when God is speaking to Abraham and he speaks to Abraham and he tells him he said can you count the Sands of the sea and he said that's how I've made your seed as a sand to the seed because it's innumerable he said your seed is also and you and you go on and even when he continues to tell later on you'll find out he even talks to Jacob and and later on in Genesis I believe it's in 30 chapter 32 of Genesis you'll find out where he comes back to to Jacob and tells him and he's speaking of the same promise that he made to Abraham and he said your seed shall be as a sand of the sea and it's the same one because he made it and even though Jacob was standing there saying God if you take care of me if you protect me from Esau you know if you do all these things and God was trying to speak to Jacob the whole time and he laid down on the Rock there that that night and he said he saw the Angels descending and ascending and he was moved by what he saw and he was still praying for God for his blessings when God kept telling he said you don't have to pray for a blessing you already blessed why because you are the Seed of Abraham you already have that seed and you can't do anything to get it and you can't do anything to lose it why because it's unmerited favor to you and so he was standing there and you know and all those type things and when he kept trying to deal with God and God's trying to get him to understand you already have it right right and so you know all the way through the scripture you know what many times we find in the scripture that we we stand there and brother random talks about him many times and you know we we asked God for these things and ask God for these things while they're already ours man he said it's the father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so there's no need of you trying to ask and beg for something it's already yours but the problem is is he said if Jesus was standing right here tonight he couldn't heal you because it's already done but you have to have faith to believe it but it's already been given unto you it's been appointed unto you and so as we get to hearing the scripture a little bit later but I want to bring some of these things out because it's so amazing because when you see the things that that the scripture talks about it not only does he talk about something that's going to take place but all the things that throughout the scripture that these things just really come out to you see uh uh let's go to Genesis 24. and I want to uh speak of just want to run through just pull out a few things and y'all just pray for me though there's a lot of things to say and don't don't know exactly which way to to go let's go back to uh let's go back to 20 uh go back to verse one if you can Brother Anderson let's go back Genesis 24 verse 1. but anyway uh I gave him a scripture and I didn't start at the beginning I'm sorry but anyway Abraham Genesis 24 verse 1 it says and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had pray out he said put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh you know make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the Earth and thou shalt not take a wife unto unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him pray a venture the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whom thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware that thou that thou bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred which spake unto me and that swear unto him saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this mine oath only bring not my son thither again and the servant put his hand under the five Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and when we go back to look at this when Abraham has Eliza come to him to make this Covenant that he would go and look for a wife for Isaac he tells him to put his hand he said pray I put your your hand under my thigh because and the reason the reason that is is because in the in the test in the scripture when you talk about the thigh that's where the power it metaphorically is is referring to power it refers to strength that's the reason in the Book of Revelation it says that the name word of God was on his thigh because that talks about the power that's because metaphorically in a person your thighs is where you have the strength leading up to your hips and your pelvic region that's where you're that's where your strength lies and so that's what he's saying he said put your hand under here we're under my thigh and he swore the the uh the oath unto him but when he when he was talking about swearing that oath and he said pre-adventure that she won't come and and Abraham stood there and told Eliezer he said my he said the Lord is will send an angel before thee he said he said he said that you are going to go and look for a wife see Abraham wasn't wishy-washy about it he wasn't he wouldn't say he's saying you go into this land and get a wife don't look for one but go get one right you're not hunting for one you're not maybe going to find one but because he said he said because Abraham said my the Lord will send his Angel before you and you will determine who the wife is and then when he says he said but prevention she won't come he said well then you'll be clear of this you'll be clear of this oath but hey see he had he had a revelation of what was going to take place so even though Eliezer was just going there was a Abraham had the Revelation to tell him this is what's going to take place and then when when he went then he was able to meet and brother Brandon talks about he said he worked on both ends because Eliza went to find Rebecca and he said at the time that Eliza would be at the well he said the angel of the Lord come and moved upon Rebecca that she would go to the well at the same time that she would be there when Eloise our matter and so even though because you know when he prayed he said let the woman that comes to draw water of me and for all the camels and everything be the one and that's exactly what she came to do because when she came she came to be as a servant unto the eliezar and and so you know that was the one and then when she came she he spoke unto her and I found out from who she was and is in the scripture says that when elas are felt met her and he found out who she was then he placed upon her the same word he placed upon her the gifts of the the earring and the and the bracelets and everything he gave them unto her and then when when he came and met her family that he you know he told the whole story of what was to take place and all the things that had happened and you know then even though she was trying to be drawn away by her family then it was still her choice because the word of the Lord had been quick and unto her brother said that she was moved to go well because she was drawn into this right right and so it was the same thing it was something that was given unto her but it wasn't just just the gifts but it was the word that was quickened to her that Drew her to cause her to leave he wasn't just gifts he just wasn't Thanksgiving unto her but there was something that took place inside of her because the word had been quickened unto her you know brother Brandon said that was the one of the problems that many people have had is he said they they took the gifts and they left the giver they've left they've left the word okay you know I was talking to brother Matthew Bray the other day that's where brother William them go to church and you know I told him I said me people nowadays you find a lot of people in there they turn away from the message you know they find more faults and more you know more wrongs in this message I said the longer I go the more I find that's right in this message the more the more that I stay in this message the more things I find that thrill me in this message I said there's more things that that uplift me in this message I said I'm sorry that nobody else can find it I said but I've been given something that's that's quick in me that's drawn me that no matter I know how many people stand in my way just like as brother random was saying there you know all the people that stand in my way or whatever you know it didn't stop Jesus it's not going to stop me because I love him and I love his people and I'm going after him and you know you keep going forward and you know brother random said that um in the and I you take it for what it's worth I know some people look at it and say well it's so funny that brother Branham was the one that was vindicating brother Branham he was making the references to the scripture that wrote you know that was all the time vindicating himself I said no it Vindicated the scripture I said the scripture was written many many many many years ago by various men from different continents but here came one here came so it's always been written it's it's no it's not any private interpretation it's been all around the world right so this right here hasn't changed but but what came off of these pages is what's what's changed because this is what's different why because as brother Madam said you know we we read the scripture through a denominational eyes we've read it through Darkness why because all of we didn't have the light to shine upon the word but you know the scripture and brother Anderson if you have that quote from the church age book this is from if he's got it from 328 let's see if he's got that but anyway you know brother random makes reference talking about the different Prophets here we go he said before we close this section on the messenger the laodice cnh we must seriously consider these two thoughts first this age we'll have one Prophet messenger Revelation 10 7 says when he's singular shall begin to sound there has never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time he said he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses he alone had the word through others though others prophesied I'm sorry if I start crying y'all just forgive me I said John the Baptist came along and it's last day there is to be a prophet not a prophetess though in this age there are more women purporting to give God's revelation to than men and the infallible word says that he the prophet will reveal the Mysteries to the end time people and to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers I'm sorry yes I tell you what if there's no stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl he said turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I challenge that statement it is a bold invalid assumption in the face of Revelation 10 7. now I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct I do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one egg of us a prophet who prophesied of a famine I agree that is so but I do but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major messenger Prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus saith the Lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major Doctrine which they all hold together who who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last stage for this last stage is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once and once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul now that's you and I I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the son amen I tell you what I love that why because that's what he come to do he didn't come to speak of himself he didn't come to prop himself up he come to speak of Jesus Christ he didn't speak of no one else he spoke of him he spoke of what the scripture said there was one man that stood here but because they they said when he's when brother Brandon was here they said he was more like Jesus Christ because there were so many people that thoughts thought so that they actually made him tried to make him Jesus Christ but see he was the one that's going to be thoroughly vindicating this message that through him not that he was trying to make himself something but he was showing the word amen amen he was opening the scripture to us I'm so thankful that we have that why because we'd still all be in darkness we'd all still be wandering around we'd all still have questions but we have someone and brother Branham said he said I must decrease that he might increase he came to bring the word back but he came to point to him that he may become the one right just just as aliens are when elizar came on the scene you know he was the one that he made itself he made Isaac known unto Rebecca but Rebecca could see Isaac people didn't it wasn't seeing brother Branham it was seeing Jesus Christ see Rebecca when she came she was on that Camel and she had traveled all that way with elizar and elizarre expound you know explained and expounded under her Isaac unto her the bridegroom that when she came into the field he was standing in the midst of the field there and you know and she saw him and she put the veil on her face and she jumped off of that Camel and she took off running to him to meet him nobody had to point out and say that is Isaac why because she knew him because of what the word had told her what elizar had expounded to her so it wasn't that we have people already uh confused or missing something why because if you've not heard from him you're not going to see him right because that's what has happened because people are still living on an intellectual idea or some kind of quote but they've never met him they're because to know him is life if you don't know him then you have nothing but he takes him that he comes on the scene and opens a scripture to you that you see him I'm so thankful that we've had that we've had a messenger to come to bring the word but I stand up and say thank God I see him because he's the one that I long to see why because when I look in the scripture I I don't want to see because when I see him I see myself I can find myself in the scripture right as he said you know all that all that God was he poured into the bride only God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the bride all that Christ was he poured into the believer all of all that was here is become us there's no one else to to be that right right to be Jesus Christ May manifest in this day but us and I'm so glad we can see Who We Are but we see Rebecca just as Rebecca we've seen who we've seen our Isaac and you know all the way through the scriptures there's many other scriptures to look at but uh you know Joseph was a was another one and in the scripture Joseph you know he was he was I see her and you know and he was hated of his Brethren and you know all the things that that we know about him but you know when he came to the point of going through all the things that all the turmoil in his life and all the things being thrown in prison and all those things but you know God had a plan for him God had a purpose in his life and when he when he came to make himself known to his Brethren said when he came to make himself known unto them then you know he stood there and you know and he opened up to them and he and he told him he said don't be afraid anyone know if his father's still living he told him he said he said don't be afraid he said because God has done this and you know any any and he blessed his Brethren but he said he done this to preserve life and so that was that what was taking place and and through all of and see his Brethren thought they were doing something that was a horrible thing and it was but the thing is is God was using that to take place to bless them and they thought that was for uh hatred they thought it was doing something and come to find out God was using that to bless them right and so you know because it was the same thing that they thought they could do uh something terrible trying to get rid of him and in the end they were blessed by it because he said God has done this to preserve life and so you know as he later laid on them and then other scriptures where he talks about all through the scripture um other scriptures you look at um when Moses was speaking to Elijah when he was talking to pharaoh and he was talking to the children of Israel and and he said that he said I'm incapable but God told him he said you know I've given you these signs I've given you Aaron to go and you go forth and you know even though he tried to do it in his self before and you know he thought he was such a failure God had got him to the exact place that he wanted him to go and then he could go into Egypt and he could go tell Pharaoh let my people go right and you know and the scripture tells us in Exodus chapter 10 . hope you don't mind and he said and the Lord said unto Moses go in unto Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and the Heart of his servants this Exodus chapter 10 verse 1 and 2. it said of his servants that I might show those my sons these my signs before him that they thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son son what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them that ye may know how that I am the Lord and so it's say it's also the same thing because when he sent him down there he said these are the things that I've done I've done unto them because I'm going to show you my power I'm going to show you who I am that you may know and that you can tell your sons and your Sons Sons and the Next Generation and all that they may know who I am and so he is these things that I've done and it goes down there and tells him tells Pharaoh he said let my people go and and he said no he said I'm going to keep you here because God said but I've hardened his heart that he could show him because you know every time Pharaoh decided he wanted to let him go but he wasn't going to let them go and so you know each one of the things when you go through the scripture when he poured out his power oh you know we poured out the plagues on Egypt you know each one of those plagues that was poured out on Egypt took down one of their gods was was in direct violence you know against conflict against one of the uh Gods of of uh Egypt that they thought they were so powerful you know they prayed for the the god of the Nile and the god of the crops and all these different things and the Sun God and all these different ones and what was it God said I'm the only God that there is and you have no there's no other God but you're praying and you think you have power here but I'm going to show you that I have power and each one of them he come along and said well we're just going to turn the water into blood and he done so and they didn't have one that could do it right and then when you curse the land and all the crops died and all the all the locusts came and each one of the gods that they had he's one of their deities That was supposed to control these things they were unable to stop the power of God and then when even when it came to the death of the firstborn he said listen he said you've got a deity he said but the death angel will pass through but he said you've got to put the butt on the door and on the lentil but you know what I'ma show you and each one of those they kept praying trying to hold on to each one of those little deities each one of their little doctrines or whatever and each one each time it came along God just wiped it off and then he told him he said now he said you can leave he said now he said I want you out of my sight and Moses said you'll never see my face again and it's when he walked out the door and he took on their journey and then when he was leading when he was leading him to the Red Sea you know they were so happy and joyous to see that they were leaving the land of Egypt because they had seen all of the the death and the destruction and the bondage that they had been in but they came to a place and the first time that they had some kind of little difficulty then all they could do was stand up and tell them Moses you've brought us out here to die yeah when God was trying to show them he said I'm going to show you my power that you can show each one of the each one of the generations what I've done and he brought them out there and he told Moses he said stretch forth thy hand with the rod over the water for the waters to part and he parted the waters and he said they started to walk upon dry land so when they started to walk upon dry land then they crossed over and then they saw their enemy in pursuit of them and they thought oh no here comes here comes the enemy and they're going to catch us but they did not realize that they were coming right in to God's trap forum when they come in and then they closed the water up on them and they never would see their enemy again right but you know the they could stand up and rejoice for a short time praise the Lord the horse and Riders fall into the sea and all these things you know that they were destroyed but the next time they had a problem they come right up and all they could do was murmur and complain against Moses and against God because of what he had done for them why because they didn't have water they didn't have food all these type things and not realizing that God was bringing a a blessing upon them every day because the scripture says their clothes never wore out they never got sick they had they had Heavenly food to Feast on every single day and you know all they could do is say oh we loathe this light bread and many times they were standing there and all they could do is look back and say oh if we he just had the fish that we had in Egypt oh if we could had the leeks and the garlics that we had in Egypt and they did not remember the beatings from the taskmasters they did not remember all the things that were brought upon them by the by the Egyptians exactly they thought it was so wonderful and had failed to see all the problems that they had and God stood there and told them even when Nathan and Cora rose up to come against them and he told them he said if these men die a natural death then God is not with us right right but he said but Moses told him he said but the Earth will open up and swallow them and then you'll know that God is with us and whose side God's Own and so when you know when that took place then they were all afraid and you know worshiped and and were were concerned and you know feared until until I got over themselves I didn't know we're right back at it blaming Moses and Aaron for the problems right but all the things that God had done for them the whole time was that he was spinning forth and doing these things to show them who he was and when when you go through and now when you go back and look I'm still talking about the word appoint now when you go back and you look at when when uh God gave Moses the plan to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness oh that's about the whole the whole chapter is is using the is using the same word him giving the the dimensions and all things to to Moses but when you when you look at all the things that he done and when he goes on and not to get into a lot of that but you know when he lays out each one of those types in the in how to lay out the Tabernacle the three the inner the outer court and the holy of holies the colors that were used all the dimensions each one of them spoke of him he had because when you look at it it spoke of God it spoke of Jesus Christ in every aspect of his life because all the way through that's who he was speaking of and and it's so amazing if you get time to start looking at some of those things but you know when he goes and he tells them to build the Ark of the Covenant and you know he tells them he said now build the Ark of the Covenant and he tells uh Moses and he tells them to to make the art and then you know he gave he gave Moses the tablets of the of the law and then he tells him that you know he broke them on the on the golden calf and he said you know take the ones that I've remade and he said now he said put them in there yeah and he said put them in there and then when he took the uh Homer of the Manna and he put that in in there because when you read in the scripture God tells them that he said this is for a covenant he said this is a testimony because you know it's called the aura it's called the Ark of the testimony why because it was God's testimony to them he said why because he said I've done these things to prove you because you know he showed them because in this was the evidence that he was putting in the whole holies of holies to show them that they did not believe that they said God would put all us out here to die he was you know we we were starving and all these things but you know what he put that Manna in there to show that he fulfilled his scripture he kept his word to them but they did not keep his that word to him right right and he'd say and he broke down the scriptures why because the other ones were broken and he wrote them again and he put them in there and so they stayed with the with the Ark of the Testament the Ark of the Covenant and they were in there why because when they looked at those those tablets The Originals were broken on the golden calf why because they went after idolatry and did not stay with the word but you know that was unto him why because he didn't leave them they left him right all the way through the scripture we'll see that he is holding up to them as brother Dale always says when you when you look in the scripture you know he keeps telling them come on to the land Fallen with milk and honey it's time to go to the land flowing with milk and honey showing them they still had a promise to them but they were the ones that did not believe that there was a prophecy there was a fulfillment there was a promise to them for this uh to display this land Right This Promise This blessing unto them and so God brought Moses along another time we see as God was bringing Moses along speaking to him lip to ear and he told he told Mo you know Moses told God said I want to see you he said will you show me yourself and he said he said you can't see me but he said I'll put you he said I'll put you in the cleft of The Rock and he said you can't see my face but he said when I passed by he said I'll put my hand over your face he said but you can see me from behind as I walked past and so he put Moses in the cleft of The Rock and that was the same the same word he put Moses in the cleft of The Rock and he passed by and Moses saw God and so that was the same it's the same meaning so he's showing how he put Moses there because Moses wanted to see him and he and he put him there on the rock for him to see him and so and then there's many other times when in The Book of Leviticus when when Aaron and and Moses Moses is preparing Aaron and his sons for their Tabernacle work and you know they had laid out all of the um the building and the Ark of the Covenant and all those things and you know Moses God tells Moses many times how they were supposed to handle each one of the articles that were to go in the holies of holies and you know he tells them he said you know they're not to touch it lest they die and so he lays he lays out all of the ordinances for them and he tells them how they're supposed to do it and then later on he gives them and because chapter Rachel you'll see where he comes in and he and he gets ready to prepare Moses I mean Aaron and the son the Levites for service and he goes in you know he he washes them and he dresses them and he gets them ready but the only time that you find where he talks about laying upon them in the in this in this word because many times he talks about he dresses them he gets them all prepared but the only time that this is used in in laying out the the levitical priesthood and the proper dressing is when he goes to the place when he put the breastplate on Aaron and when he put the miter on his head was the only time that was used because the rest of the time it's showing that he's just giving Aaron something even though he's dressing him he's giving it to him that he's helping because it's part of what Mo Aaron was doing it's not just him working but it's actually what Aaron was doing but when Aaron had come to the place that he was consecrated and he was anointed to do his work then the prophet Moses laid the laid the breastplate on him that wasn't something that Aaron done that was something that Moses done because that had to be laid upon Him by him and he put the miter on his say it so he was prepared for the finishing at the end a lot of it was done by by Aaron but when it came to the end that was done by Moses and so it's showing the same thing that it was something that that we didn't that he didn't do it was what the prophet had done for him to prepare him for that and many other ones the uh raising putting the brass serpent on the pole all those type things uh all those had to do with laying what uh what God was doing that he told him to raise that that serpent up and that if you would look on it and believe that he would he would heal you so all those type things were part of the uh of what he had given unto them for the so but uh I want to get back over here but I just wanted to there's so many things when you start getting into scripture you start looking at he said he's going yeah yeah and I hope that didn't but I want to I just want I enjoyed it so much but when you come to understand when he said to a point unto them it's not something that he's that he's just decided it's not a decision but it was something that was laid upon them and you go through the scripture and it's all through the scripture if something that he laid upon them when even when you go back through the scripture uh the when when Abraham laid Isaac on the altar was was another one when he laid him on the altar to sacrifice him all those type things are showing something that you know Abraham was laying Isaac on the altar it's the same word Isaac didn't get himself up there Abraham put him on there all those type things are showing what God was doing and he comes and so back to Isaiah 61 here says he said to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion yeah so when he said oh no we're going to a point unto them is to give unto them it's something that he is putting on them because I want you to read these things to understand what he's talking about he said to a point unto them or to lay upon them he said even in the scripture in the scripture predestinated all the different uh the definitions of the word but it was something that was definite to station to and the other one the one I want to get to was to transform to transform into to to trade so all these things to direct to lay upon to station all these things when he talks about to appoint unto them that morning Zion Zion talks about is Jerusalem Jerusalem is and and the scripture talks about is Jerusalem and you know Jerusalem was was the temple and and the most important part was the holy of holies and the holy of holies was the place where God met with man and so when you speak of Zion that's where God meets which is the only place that God met with man was under the shed blood which is under the word and so when he speaks all of them that mourn in Zion and we understand that this is speaking of of Israel coming back into a place where they're being restored and so we understand that but it's unto us a spiritual Zion right right he said to give unto them Beauty for Ashes so this is what he's doing to them he said to a point unto them that morning Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes now the another word when you go back and look you know what to to the word beauty there means an adorning or a headdress or a covering something that is put upon put upon your to on the head because he said he wanted to give give them Beauty for Ashes ashes in in this situation usually refers to uh funeral or death or also refers to worthlessness because when you go back through the scripture when when uh Elsa has to do because it also has to do with mourning and uh repentance and and uh worthlessness and um stress and trials and tribulations because you know there's many times you go back and look um job when when God took it took away the Hedge from job and the Satan was able to pour out all these things upon job then job went sat on said as sackcloth and Ashes so that's what is showing that he was uh he was in a trial or a tribulation and he was sitting in ashes and you know and even when Mordecai found out that Haman had went to the king and had got a decree for all the Jews to die and he had went and told Esther when when he sent the word to Esther Mordecai was in sackcloth and Ashes waiting and saying and they were all in mourning and they were all crying out to God and he sent word to Esther or what was going to take place and told Esther said listen said you won't you won't escape this also because that if they're going to kill all the Jews they'll kill you too and so that's when you know she had to go before the king to get a decree to say this amen amen so and even even when when uh Jonah had went to Nineveh and you know and he rebuked nine of for their sin and everything like that and he said they put it in sackcloth and Ashes and even put sackcloth on their animals because that was a sign of repentance because they they had come under this condemnation and so they decided you know because they come under this repentance so it's showing a worthlessness but it's showing many things that has come upon them and uh even in the scripture when you go back and um I think it was Eamonn which was one of David's Sons amen had a sister named Tamar and Tamar had come under him and you know he said that uh he pretended to be sick and you know he went after his sister and you know he went in and when she after he took and abused her then when she came out from underneath that because she was in such a low state that she came out and said it had ashes upon her head and she went under her brother absalom's house because she was such because she was so devastated because of what had happened so it was showing a low sitting and it's a stress a trial of all these type things and he says but he gives unto them a headdress or an adorning something that's beautiful because of this worthlessness that they feel because there's such a low state but he's laying something upon you because you're in such a low state but here's this beautiful thing that he's adorning you with and so it's sitting upon your head he said Beauty for Ashes he said the all of joy for mourning Joy the all of Joy refers to an anointing because you know all the way through the scripture when you go back and look at the word gladness throughout the scripture David brings that out about being the gladness and having the all of gladness upon him and he talks about the so when he refers to the all of Joy when we know that all the type of the Holy Ghost coming upon you because we know that the type of joy is one of the gifts of the Spirit one of the fruits of the spirit upon you so he said you received all of joy for mourning right so you go through this and you're under this time of of death or this morning this funeral so in the time of of death all the way around because we understand the death angel is passing through the land today because we're in this great time and you know um brother Adam tells the story about the young man standing in there and you know they hear the way the Weeping and the Wailing because the death angel was passing through and the death of the firstborn was taking place and that little boy he was so he was so fearful he said father are we are we okay is it okay are we going to make it right he said Son let me show you he said the prophet has given us the word of God and we lay upon the blood upon the door and upon the doorpost and you know what we're safe and the Death Angel will pass by so he says we've received this all of Joy that's gladness that's uplifting something that's being poured upon us because even even in the Old Testament when the uh the priests were anointed even when David David didn't pour the oil upon himself Samuel poured it on him when the all was poured upon Aaron Moses pulled the ore upon Aaron that he was anointed with so it was a there was something to say showing something that's God's doing for you that you're in a time of mourning whatever your is but he's anointing you with joy he said the Garment of Praise something else because when in the in the New Testament there when because it's an Old Testament type you know when I'm when you come to a person's house and you've been on a long travel and they washed your feet then they gave you a robe to put on they put on a robe on you took off your whirly clothes that you wore on the walking through the you know through the muck and everything and the sweat and the Heat of the day and it was a wonderful new garment that was put upon you and so he says there's a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness because it was a spirit he said it was a a dullness or or a faint that you're about to faint and the scripture tells us he said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall grow walking up and be weary they shall walk and not faint so we can walk because we've received this Garment of Praise because he said God inhabits the Praises of his people so here he comes upon us so we have this and Garment of Praise is Thanksgiving adoration uplifting God because the because if you have this Spirit of heaviness upon you he said come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy light and he said I will give you rest he said come and talk to your my yoke upon you my birdie of Burden upon you because it's light it's it's not this heaviness but there's something this yoke is lied upon you he said because then he says that they may be the Trees of Righteousness the planning of the Lord that he might be glorified the Trees of Righteousness that's that's what he's done it's the planning of the Lord that tree Psalms 1 says like a man tree planted by the rivers of water so that's the way that's who we are that he says that we have this this planting the Trees of Righteousness starting out a small but we've actually grown up into God's righteousness that we he said that he might be glorified amen that's what we are all these things have become upon us but you know what none of these things are on us as just something that that God made a decision but you know what when God gave you the new birth when God Gave You himself when he put himself in you come on come on this is what he's laid upon you he's laid upon these things he's so when you say well I don't I don't feel this way that doesn't matter you have received these things you have received Beauty for Ashes you've received the all of joy for Mourning see things in your life are not going to go the way that you want to but you know what we have a strength to draw from why because these things have been laid upon us because you know what all the things of that were on us all our sin was right upon him that you know what all the things that he is has been laid upon us and here we are that we can be this tree that he might be glorified through you and I because that's what he's given to us so whatever you have need of you come here tonight and say well I have this or that no you have what God said you have not all everything else is Vanity everything else is a lie but you know what you have what God is saying he said the scripture says that you have been given exactly because you've received this he said out of your bellies not anybody else's but out of your bellies shall flow Rivers not just a trickle not just a little drop here and there but he said rivers of Living Water that's what's inside of you he said everything that the bride had need of everything a Believer had need I was given to him in the new birth but you know what he said there's an inexhaustible fountain that you and I can drink from he said if we just drink from that he said then we can push out why because it's inside of us Brother Dean for us to make manifest these things it's always been there but you know we've come to the realization of who God is and who we are to make him manifest that he might be glorified no wonder David said I can run through a true leap over a wall I don't know if I could run but I felt I might get I could jog pretty fast but that's what God's given us that's who we are we have been blessed amen so let's all stay in this evening I'm so glad that we've received these things he has anointed me to preach the gospel he's anointed us and then he come to declare these things to us the prophet came to declare these things to us right he said he said it's not he said you're not feeding on the seventh Angel's message it's not the messenger it's not his message he said but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man I'm so glad that he's making known these things to us I tell you what you start reading through there and you start seeing all the things that God's done all the things that God's done he's he's given these things to you he's laid it on you know brother Brahm talks about writing a check you know he he said you know you he said it's a bank draft on Heaven he said you can write a check for it right he said it's there but the thing is you've got to write the check but it's there he's like my favorite just like my favorite quote I I tell it all the time I love it you know brother Brown talks about that lady she didn't know what she had in the Bible she was she was poor barely making it thought she was going to have to go get help from charity and everything but everything she had neither was in her Bible but you know what somebody had to point out to her what laid in the scripture that belonged to her and then when she saw that she didn't need anything else why because it was right there and I'm so glad we've received we because God has come down in our day and in our time and he's made these things known to us
