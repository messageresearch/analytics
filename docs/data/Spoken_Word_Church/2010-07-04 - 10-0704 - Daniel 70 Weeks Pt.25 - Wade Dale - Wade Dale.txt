of the Lord now go isah I just read the five way okay f isah all right what verse in chapter N Honey look on my paper seven there and seven of the increase of his government and the peace there shall

chapter 11 verse 6ap uh 11 11 639 1116 69 6 the wol also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young Li and the battling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the line shall eat straw like the ox and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the As and the wean child shall put his hand on the cockr then then yeah they shall not hurt nor destroy any and all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea okay now Isaiah I think we're back again we're okay here we're recording that's part of Sunday school taking of yeah that's right that's right we're okay Isaiah two see what it's talking about here in the top of the mountain in the last days the mountain of the Lord house shall be established in the top of the mountain and shall be exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow into it now that's you and I in Jerusalem but that's also talking about Jerusalem cuz that's what it's all going to happen right there okay all right and many people shall go and say come you let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways now the children of Israel think that that's going to be us going and getting taught by them but it's not it's just revers we're going to be the ones in the Temple teaching the ones outside all right but now there's not in this right here this is not the future home at this point but yet it could be the future home at this point all right to the house of God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem and he shall judge among the Nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their Spears into and the pruning hooks Nations shall not lift up sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore this can be a twofold this can be either in the Millennium or the future home all right now let's go to Isaiah 9 that brother joh just read this is the promise of the baby Jesus coming let's read verse six For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government not our government you know we we're glad today that that we have a government that's independent um not very good at all we know that the United States is going to get their judgment but still I'd rather live here than anywhere on the face of the Earth amen right maybe Alaska but that's still the United States of America okay of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David here is the promise to the Jews that David's son will sit on the throne Rule and Reign Over his people that's the Millennium that's the remember brother randam said that that that God comes in three right Son of God Son of Man son of David all right and um or son of man Son of God Son of David all right but he was actually Son of God in the Old Testament which is Spirit God Son of God is Spirit God son of man is is God In the Flesh that's son that's a son of man all right then remember he left and come back on the day of Pentecost as a Son of God in the end time he's come back as the son of man but he's promised in the Bible to come as son of David to the Jews because they missed him the first time so he's to come in the Millennium to rule and Reign a thousand years over the 12 tribes and right here is the the prophecy upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this all right so that Throne of David is the the davidic Covenant you can if you got a scoffield Bible he'll tell you to go to 2 Samuel we won't go there for saing time 2 Samuel 7 8-17 now the promise sure we know the natural promise of David was was to Solomon sit on the throne all right and then he did but the spiritual promise the one the the real son of David was Jesus Christ all right so he's promised to come in the Millennium now he won't set he in the Millennium he's going to set is the son of David but he won't be son of David in the future home what's he going to be all in all right all right Revelations let's turn over to Revelations 20 excuse me one verse chapter 21 chapter 21 verse one now this is the future home we're going to kind of parallel a little bit today and then we'll go back and just stick with what's going to happen in the Millennium all right and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there were no more sea now this is the Battle of Gog and Magog it's all finished the white Throne judgment is over all the Sinners are in hell all the Christians are in heaven but where is heaven and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven so where are we going to live right here on this earth right we're not going to heaven Heaven's coming right here this is what God made this Earth for all right there is no heaven to go to brother BR said heaven was silent nobody was up there right right we're all down here and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband because when that City comes down it is for you and I remember we we read last week that in the Millennium in Isaiah 65 it says that we will build and inhabit future home is not that way this is what's coming down from John 14 and I'll read it you don't have to turn to it but I'll read it John 14 is the future home let your not Hearts be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house or many mansions if I were if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again now in Isaiah it did not say that Isaiah said we would build we would inhabit right we read it last Sunday this says Jesus is going to prepare a place for us and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and we know who who the way is now let's go back to chapter 21 so where is the future homecoming to this Earth but it's a city already built and it's going to sit down right on top of a mountain in the Millennium there will be a mountain the mountain of Olives right but we're going to build and inhabit that piece of land here is a future home coming down and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son right there he's taking away all Jew Gentile Heathen blah blah blah he's taking all that away he's come to one spot he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son all right and that's where we're coming to there now that that's not in the Millennium that Revelation 21 is in the future home all right in the Millennium he's the son of David we're there as a what honeymoon we're there as a honey the Millennium is really nothing to us except we're going to be there because we're already Eternal Body Spirit and soul we don't have anything to do with the Jews natural right and we don't have to We Can't Live A Thousand Years we're Eternal that's right somebody's got to live a thousand years but it's not that that that Millennium is not saying the bride's going to live a thousand years we're going to live in eternity we started in eternity when you receive a new birth here but our body's going to be changed here all right so when we go into Millennium the Millennium is nothing more and I don't want to make it so little that it's nothing but it's really not anything to the bride cuz we don't have to when we accepted Christ we went into that Eighth Day we come out of that thousand years that God said the day you eat thereof that day you die we're already in that now cuz the day you eat of whatever you you know Methodist Baptist bromite whatever you eat of that fruit you'll die in that day all right so we've come through all that we got all that out of the way that's done so in the Millennium we're just there to relax um I don't think we'll just sit around you know on a log doing nothing I think there's things we'll do soon you probably going have to get up all right so now in Isaiah 9 though it promised that the Jews would have a son of David sitting on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of Israel all right okay so now you got you got a question go ahead um in my Bible I had written a while ago from someone U where it says that there was no more sea there was no more mixed multitude of of Mind people would be one mind like you said right yeah there'll be no more SE and that of course C is like I said see water is people seea is people but I see that too is that when brother random explain see it said there would be no more sea didn't say there wouldn't be any more ocean right said there would be no more sea all right now this is just my thoughts on this matter this is Israel right here's the Mount of Olives what is this right here well every how you smell every how you smell that the Mediterranean Sea 1,500 miles that mountain is going to push up what's it going to do it's going to do away with the Mediterranean Sea right because from Israel to to Rome or Italy that comes down like the boot thing is about 1500 miles so if that mountain pushes up there's not going to be any more sea no more Mediterranean Sea the Mediterranean Sea it'll just push out out cuz the Mediterranean Sea is kind of you know in a a big Gulf like thing it's just going to push out and do away with the sea but it can't do away with the ocean cuz I don't think God created the oceans and the whales and the Dolphins and all that for them to just disappear I don't think that'll happen Okay so that's way I look at it in a carnal sense or in a natural sense of what's going to happen and then in a spiritual sense there'll be no more seed there'll be no more mixed like she like said there be no more mixed m you to people that's got this opinion and that opinion so like he said he that's overcome I'll be his God and that's what you're going to see because even in Revelations 21 on over it says I saw no Temple therein so for the Lamb of God Almighty and I mean the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple are thereof okay so there's not going to be sacrifices you know Jews everybody's going to come into one mind I don't think the people outside the city are going to have the knowledge that we have because they'll have to be taught things right all right go ahead one more what's what do you think David's Position will be in the future home do what David King David what do you think his position would be in the future home Ian will he have a province here we go back again I don't want to be mean but I really don't care I mean it has nothing to do with us I mean really David I don't think he'll sit on a throne ain't going to be but one Throne that's what I just read you right here right a going to be one throne and we going to know who that man is because there's going to be one throne and God's going to be sitting on it see and that's it there's going to be not another Throne sure we're the Throne of God but there's going to be one throne and that King Jesus is going to be sitting on that Throne they ain't going to be a King David they ain't going to be a king whoever right Solomon ain't going to be a King Solomon there going to be a King Jesus and that's going to be it because we know he's the one that did all the work for us right and that gives me that gives me hope that I don't have to say well do I have to go to this King to get to this king or go to this to get no that's like you just Jesus all and all King Jesus that's what he said he said I'm all on his shoulders exactly the government's on his shoulders it's his it's his see John 14 is his problem to to fix right understand what I'm saying let's just be plain street Lan John 14 was his problem to fix and he fixed it right see this is this is kind of um man's problem the Millennium because God said you eat a thousand years you know I mean the day you eat there of that day you die man's the one that messed it up I know God's got to bring it back but still even in the Millennium there's things going to transpire we're going to actually use our hands to do things we're actually going to probably build and put together and you know I don't understand all that but I know one thing's for sure in the future home that was my next Point you're going to see King Jesus and that's it see you got you got things that are transpiring in the Millennium because scriptures having to be fulfilled once you get to Revelations 21 and 22 there's no more scripture to be fulf F right we just go Rush straight into into the you know into the the glory of the Lord and they'll be King Jesus and he'll be the light and we're not going to have to worry about going you know I think what'll happen is that that the people on the outside of the city when you talk to them I believe they're going to say hey those people are so connected to God to their God in human flesh because when I go somewhere with my son he's connected to me because he's my son son right M right right can't deny it can't get away from it and if in the natural he thinks like I do then how much more the spiritual that the the the the God of all glory has G you the mind of Christ well if he's given you the mind of Christ then that mind that's the same mind if if Christ is thinking that same way you're thinking that same way right how do you think in the Bible it says before we even think it God will already have it there that's right right well that's not a human mind human mind can't do that human mind is pretty fast but it's not that fast right that when you say I'd like to have a house built and boom there it is he's already got it there for you asked for it right you know I'd like to have you know this and that and the other so and what a wonderful thing but on in the Millennium he's going to be the son of David in the future home he King Jesus and and let's put this to right here all in all and we're not going to listen folks he's not going to lose you know the Bible says sunship will terminate because through the son you and I get born again through the Son of God Son of Man coming and dying releasing the life which is the Son of God that makes us newborn babies in Christ and then we grow in Grace and knowledge but hey when we get to right here that's King Jesus and it's all in all but we're not going to ever forget that he was Jesus on Earth Earth that died for our sins we're not ever going to forget that he was the son of God that came to you one day to give you the New Birth when the Bible says the sunship will terminate that's where people in the meage say oh you're saying Eternal sunship he's always going to be Eternal Son of God he's always going to be Eternal son of man he's always going to be Eternal son of David right because that's what the Bible this is the Eternal Word of God and if it said in here it can't go away right but when we get here we've been through this already the son of d David part has been manifested but when you manifest something that don't mean you do away with it that means it just becomes a part of you okay everybody understand that become a part of do what will that part just be a memory that part will be a memory but we remember how the surely the the the Jews will will realize it more than we did cuz that's what they're looking for they're looking for God to come and sit on a throne in Jerusalem and rule over the 12 tribes just like he promised him he would it be more like a revelation exactly it'll stick exactly memories don't stick Revelations do the Revelation you got a one God is not going to go away when we get in a future home right when we go into eternity and walk through the streets of gold we're going to come back to that basic one God principle and we're going to know he's that one God we're going to look at him right straight in the face right and and and not forget the journey because the Bible says the former things will pass away the bad things m former things will pass away even in our human mind there's a lot of things remember they say that if something catastrophic happens in your life that your mind will cut it off well guess what God will do he'll just throw that thing over and the see of forgetfulness and you won't remember I mean I don't know about you but let's turn to Isaiah 11 and get that finished before we I don't know about you but uh I'm going enjoy talking about Fellowship we had down here amen verse six now this can be applied to both Millennium and future home all right the wolf shall also dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lay down with a kid I want us to get one thing in our mind God does things in steps so that we can understand it cuz remember in his mind it's already finished anyway but he does things in steps to let us see things right so what's he doing here he's showing us that he's bringing everything and restoring it back cuz remember if this pen drops I got to pick that pen back up to the same place not down here not up here same place for that to be restoration so man was at a place to where this right here actually went on in the Garden of Eden before the fall before the fall lions eat grass huh man ate fruit okay so that's exactly what we're going back to cuz what did we fall from we fell from that condition the Earth's got to come back to that condition but it's going to be done in stages the Millennium is something that God has put in there to show that when he told Eve he said the day you eat thereof that day you'll die then we read last Sunday where a day is a thousand years and a thousand years is a day all right so to God he was saying that hey you eat of that fruit you're going to die you're never going to live a, years years if you eat because what Eve's problem was is she partook of what happened in the garden we know it's not fruit it was a sex act fruit in the garden cuz remember you're what are you you're the fruit of your mother's womb okay the Bible says many many times you're the fruit of the womb all right so that's what he was talking about but you take God in the garden he said the day you eat of that day you die well when Eve done what she done she didn't didn't die that day she didn't die the next day she didn't die the next day so she built her a denomination she built her an idea that hey I'm helping God and the devil's going see there you didn't die let's do it again so she took it to her husband you didn't die instantly God said you'd die don't you know the devil was standing there when all that happened you know that he wasn't off somewhere on vacation he was standing right there okay so the day you eat of that day you die well now what God what what has God got to do methusa live 969 years and that's the oldest man ever to live all right so nobody lived a th now to prove that the sin curse is done away with somebody's going to live at TH what was the sin curse back in the garden right right not to break God's law but to prove that God was promising them that if you eat that and you do that and you sin that day you're going to die so now to prove that that's over with somebody's going to live a thousand years and like I said it's not us that's right we're not even in a day we're in an eighth day we're in an eternity so it's not to us it's somebody's going to live a natural 1,000 years during that Millennium to prove that's why I say is it going to be if you ever thought about this is it going to be a millennium of 360 days 365 days right because in the back in the garden the Earth was standing straight up so it's 360 days cuz you got to go back to the restoration right you don't go back to January February March April and then you have to have a leap per of a fourth year no it's 30 days to a month somebody will live A Thousand Years prove that the sin curse is over then we go into whatever the Battle of Gog and Magog or the white Thor judgment but you see like I'm saying it's not just boy when that Thousand-Year day is up remember God Blends everything together it's not something for God stops and starts something again all right so this Millennium the wolf shall dwell with the lamb leopard shall lie lay down with a kid calf and the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed not on each other their young on shall lie down together and the lion shall eat strong like the O and the suck sucking child shall play on the hole of an ass and the weaning child shall put his hand in the cockatrice den see that's the Millennium cuz there won't be any children in the future home now brother brandham they ask him said will children be born in the Millennium probably because of this scripture he said some way I can see yes some way I can see no but that doesn't matter to me and you don't get hung up on that cuz you and I are not going to be doing that right in the Millennium we're Eternal the the desire of of husband and wife is going to be over with we're going to have a much higher love than that right but somebody may do that I don't know cuz there's got to be a person somebody's got to live a natural Thousand Years all right we better go we's see you next Sunday what
