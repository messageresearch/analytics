so anything past that we're gonna have a preacher up here good afternoon all praise be to God um brother Joe I'm going to talk about two other situations before we get to that third one I have a stomach virus so you'll see me holding my stomach weight will poke fun at him he is always talking about how old I am but I have the road a virus which attacks babies thank you very much okay if if you don't mind this just sharing this afternoon I was supposed to sing but this means more to me my heart and my family and I want my family here to pray for us please the second reason why I'm sharing this is for you all to see the mighty mighty mighty hand of God's grace and mercy and you will see that from the pictures Kendrick has a drinking problem the first situation happened in 2013 oh yeah I meant to do that thank you it's nerves my name is Regina Arline I have a son whose name is Kendrick our line for those who don't know he's 23 years old and he's gonna be 24 shortly and that shows a little shine on nanny and poppy brother and sister Dale were at the hospital before I was they saw the baby before I did amen thank you 24 years ago 2013 high school year he fell asleep at a light he was arrested in a DUI the second one was two months ago now mind you March and y'all heard me after prayer he went down in the ditch and totaled that car that was a Nissan Altima Kendrick walked out of that ditch called his buddy but he picked him up he spent the night over there and I picked him up from there the next day no cop involved coming from a cookout I'm just saying the third one is this one that you're gonna see some pictures of and and I'll tell you the story after go ahead brother Joseph front left of the car you see it go ahead next one rear left of the car the trunk the right rear of the car the left of the front aside you don't talk about this is his brand-new 2018 Hyundai Sonata mmm last Sunday I was on my way to church he called me he was in the cop car on his way to jail he had hung out in Atlanta on Saturday Cinco de Mayo and he thought he couldn't make it to South Carolina to visit another buddy he got on i-20 on Sunday morning about eight o'clock he called me before I arrived here at the parking lot oh brother go ahead and show that other picture brother Joe okay this is us going back to the site you see the long guardrail I know you can't see it that well I'll tell you he didn't hit that guardrail he hit the steel columns on this sign you see the sign is toppled over that's that big old sign on the side of the road okay that probably kept him from paralleling further down into the woods we went by this site on Tuesday and we picked up one shoe and one shoe and charged her stuff and a brush and some toiletries were further down in there on last Sunday morning an EMS person off-duty emergency medical services person paul kendrick out of the sunroof out of this sunroof cuz that's the only way they can get him out brought him to the hospital Kendrick has just an inflamed shoulder nothing broken we've investigated possible head injury or anything like that nothing you see how this boy is playing with the devil old slewfoot okay oh I forgot to tell you the testimony about my mom I'm sorry my father we think there is a genetic disposition to this of course you and I know who this is okay but we can't deny my father was an alcoholic my um my mother Blessed Mother um we left my father when I was seven years old because there was domestic violence involved with his drinking they both put each other in the hospital at one point but anyway we left him we went to stay with my grandmother in a two room apartment that's seven women in a two room apartment we stayed with her until we were able to get our own place my mother never filed for child support she raised five girls single-handedly she always invited him to all the family functions but she never charged him when we're done penny she raised us by herself okay so back to Kendrick nothing at the hospital this boy is playing with fire this is the third one I picked him up from Green County Jail last Sunday after I left here from church he knows it it's a wake-up call he knows God in his life he knows that he says that he's been with me all week we'll see how it goes but I want you all to pray pray and don't just pray one time keep praying because there's loz after us through on the high on the roads he's after us cuz I had you know Bambi hitting me at my car I hit I tell and it's Owen on the left so he's after us if you'll just remember to keep on praying okay oh man the highlight of this other people stopped and they picked the pissed off and put it in the overnight bag he had he had a pair of pants on now he stopped by our lines house to get some other things got off at my accident got an energy drink but in his pants pocket that he didn't have on he put them in the trunk there was a sizable amount of cash in the pocket when we went to that site or when we went to the collision place to get the rest of the stuff out the car those pair of pants was the truck with the cash in it but God and God has a sense of humor and he would drop the mic right now but God thank you I had a friend of ours one time Terrance Nuri great Wyatt was driving the truck for us and he had about two accidents and he actually went into an old barn he's a phenomenal Christian guy and he he told us when we got down there he said I am so glad God was riding with me there was an older gentleman come out of his house and was standing there watching us and he looked over at Rick and he said you keep driving like that he won't so let's stand our feet point well-taken so we've seen these things you know Josh did the same thing he had a my son had an accident several many years ago now and remember that and the people swore another man got out of the car they thought there was a guy in the car with him well we know who that was it was his guardian angel dusting himself off because of what happened in him the same way so we need to keep kinder all our kids in their prayer amen we'll talk about that in just a minute if we get to it about something - Lord show me about applying as token so let's go to revelation 6 verse 1 and we'll begin here we're still on the second seal we will since I got both services next Sunday we will thinks - pops gonna take a little R&R time and that's good he deserves it after all these years he needs some good are in our times so I think we missing for one Sunday maybe okay all right but just pray for us we should finish up with the second seal I I keep you keep seeing things and I you know downstairs we're in the book of Romans and even starting in the book of Romans the Lord just really impressed on me to start up just a Bible study about the book of Romans not you know not what the Prophet said and not what you know a good a Bible study of what Paul was talking to the people about and once you see that though you start looking at justification then you look at sanctification you look at all the the things that the Prophet said but when brother Brown said that the Bible became a brand-new book he was not joking he was telling the truth that that man had read the Bible since the 20s I guess when he was a young man and he had he had combed through the Bible and you know and probably wore a couple out but that Bible became a brand-new book it didn't become new as in physical but when brother Adam would read it then he could see more of in depth of what God already had in there when some extra these thunders are not something extra but what it does it ties the entire Bible together it makes you when you look at this Word of God and you see it's like brother Dale said this morning and you we have to see it this way that God is talking to several different groups of people in the Bible sure it's sure it's written for Christians amen but it is talking to the center because the center has to hear this and respond but now as we become more mature like brother Dale with so much this morning you know being a baby in Christ which is good and and drinking milk is good but I like some good strong meat you know in same way here is when we can read the Bible over again and you get a little more read the Bible you get a little more a baby can read it and just and just glean all kinds of things but then you go back and read it with a greater revelation you thought man where'd that come from well it's been in there the whole time it's been in there since since they put the Bible together so that's just the way God is you know this is the way we're gonna this is brother Brian the only way we're going to know by God there's no other book there's no other prophet to come there's no other this to come there's no this is it this is it and God is so gracious I was telling them this morning when Paul was writing to the Romans when Paul was writing to the Romans when Paul will get up and preach a sermon you couldn't fall asleep or you couldn't lay out cuz you know what we got all this now Paul when he preached him when Peter preached they had to go home and they had to glean that in their head but you know what the Holy Ghost will bring back what to your remembrance what's been said all right so that's what we need to depend on because you know quotes will kill you Paul said the letter killeth I can take these quotes and make them all different kind of things but remember God doesn't change his words the same in you know if I can't depend on anything else I depend on that God's Word will never change if he did it the first time one ways god I'd do it the same the next way okay so let's uh let's go to the Lord and pray the only father you've heard the testimony this morning or this afternoon Lord that you do watch over us even in our time of ignorance in the time that we all had the conversation Paul said in times past in the world the things that we done Lord you you're still has that angel watching over us and I pray now that you would just not just watch over Kendrick but Lord may you give him the baptism of the Holy go and that would look over him more than anything Lord not to be watched over but to be an N word dwelling being father we ask you Lord to be with us here be with all the mothers give them a good day today Lord and thank you for each one thank you for the good weather we've been having lord I thank you for all the things that you've given us the safe trips and journeys that we took we pray that you would just be with the ones that are not here Lord be the ones that are sick we were the ones Lord in the foreign fields give them a fruit for their labor father just be with us today in the further ment of this service be the active participant Lord you be the speaker you be the hero father and with Jesus we ask these things amen revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw him when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were the voice of thunder one of the four beasts say come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him out of the bow and the crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and we've been through that already and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see so in other words the second beast which is the ox made a call come John John you taught the bride John come and see come and see what's going on all right and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword you may be seated in the Lord is blessing to the reading of the word now what we've been doing is is we've been looking at the second seal which is hey hope he good girl I told him we had church on Sunday afternoon and she decided to come that's one of my other daughters that I pray for what we pray for them all you know that we all grew up together like that most of you young ones you know everybody was there at the hospital when you were born almost church family I think's supposed to be stronger than then then human mortal family anyway yeah man we're all one in the body of Christ yeah and I truly believe that I think God does too God believe it's his own word but brother Brian said that one time he said not God God believes his own word amen why when he said let there be he didn't stutter amen he in started when he said let us make man I don't know he had the whole thing worked out so and that's what we're trying to we we were in Arizona and thank you for your prayers we had a real good time we visited some really nice places and brother Chris has got a real nice church very strong in the word didn't have to do a lot of background or fill in they were right there with us so small group maybe twelve fourteen people but you know what the ephesian church was a powerful church and they had 12 people so I'd rather have 12 people with the holy ghost and hundred without a man all right so now we're looking at the at redemption so now we're we're still we're not looking so much at the horse rider because we know that was read and we know that that was that he went forth conquering in the first three Church ages and in that fourth Church age he settles in and attaches itself to that middle church age and will not get the chart out today I'll try to be a little bit shorter today since I got next Sunday both services so so we can we can be a little short today and and let you get home and visit your mama if you if your mom ain't here so and also for about five minutes after the service all the men that are have anything to do or want to have anything to do with the Father's Day fishing trip we're going to have to postpone the one that we usually do we've been doing it for I don't know close to ten years I guess going through the Chattahoochee River upper Chattahoochee and trout fishing and camping well that's all been closed off because of the rain and they've had a big landslide and the road got washed out so we can't go there this year after about ten years of doing it it was really nice so we're gonna have to either find another place postpone it or do something different so we need to meet for about five minutes if you don't mind down at the picnic table and we will let's go over a few options and see what what we want to do that's that's a real good time we've always had a good time there so well let's just pray about them so now Redemption now remember the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul like we're talking about the soul is redeemed by the new birth the shed blood of Jesus Christ and I was telling the brothers out in Arizona you got to remember one thing that you're not saved by the blood you know I saved by the blood you're saved by the life in the blood but you're kept saved by the blood I got a quote on quote it in just a few minutes for brother Aaron said you're not saved by the blood listen you could take all the blood of Jesus Christ that ever was in his sacred wonderful body pour it all over you and you would just be wet that's what we do with a lot of people baptize them when they don't repent we just have a bunch of wet sinners hey man but we don't want that but once you take that life though and put it inside of a person see then that blood then it's like you put it over the lentil of the doorpost you put that blood out their own display what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood but it's the life in the blood amen it's the life in the blood so we need to look at this as we see red because remember the seals are not necessarily I say nothing necessarily because you can hear them and get something off of it and it will help you but it's like I was telling them in Arizona mm-hmm you got to do you got a compartmentalize things okay because remember and they looked a little cross-eyed and you made two but your body doesn't sin flesh this body that you're looking at it's a product of sin but this body you're looking at it's not sin it's like brother Chris said he's just what holds all the guts and stuff together yeah that's what it is the whole it's the framework you say how can you prove that brother branham what is sin he said it's not smoking drinking gambling running around What did he say unbelief was I mean saying was unbelief and where does that come from this guy you looking over this this right now it doesn't come from this guy that was a Freudian slip of the phone but this thing right here that's not sin I'm gonna live in this for an eternity this same hand that you see used to hold the beer in his hand used to hold the beer now God didn't take this thing off and throw it away and bring me a new one no he cleaned up this one what he changed the one on the inside amen so that's our problem is we go oh I'm just I said in my flesh no you do not you manifest that sin with your flesh a man because the motivator it's not the flesh it's like I was telling them out in Arizona you take somebody and you sever their spine in a young boy god forbid but you do that and that kid lays in a bed for the rest of his life now you can't account his flesh to sin but he's a sinner in God's eyes if he don't give his heart to Christ hey man so maybe we look into things thing just a little bit different I was telling them downstairs the Bible says if this earthly tabernacle were dissolved were dissolved I'm not gonna be part of that I'm not if this earthly tabernacle work dissolve we have one waiting but what if I get this one changed it won't deal of that's what we're trying to do with these cells is we're trying to bring our mentality it's like I said before you know when my brother branham was preaching the breach I know you've heard it I'm gonna tell you again but brother Branham was preaching the breach all down to the seven churches I'll fly away Oh glory when I die you're buying buy that's all in you now we sing I can't die hallelujah by and by why because we've come to a revelation that somebody is going to take a body change so brother Branham in the breech he listened the the property guard to do two things remember he's supposed to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith the father's not tell us how to not drink smoke gambling all the other stuff like daddy said with my brother Dale was saying this morning brother Bob didn't come to freeze holiness he met holiness people but he changed what he took the doctrines that were wrong that they were preaching that's all loose ends that's what he was somebody he puts the loose ends back together hey man hey man so that's nothing new it's just what he does like Elijah he rebuilt the altar remember who tore it down the prophets of Bale's one who tore the altar down remember they jumped up and down on his screen and hollered right well Elijah but the altar bang he restored worship back to where God could talk to us amen we're glad could speak bring full fellowship into manifestation that's what I'm looking at full fellowship back into manifestation where Elijah put - what do you do when he put that altar back together God came down God came down and vindicated that prophet I believe God's vindicated our prophet but remember like brother Dale said this morning and I you know what I'd never seen it like that before because God forbid some people believe that brother Branham fulfilled all five offices which is fine I believe that apostle prophet pass was teaching advantage that right but that would mean singular read your Bible it says he gave some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers that's all poor all a man he gave it it's all plural not singular but we had to hear it from one person a man it used to be a one man message it's not anymore amen amen it's a fivefold ministry prophets apostles pastors I you know what I never even read it a million times so of you they're all plural one person is not plural one person is people it's God sent people to show us this book of redemption in clarity that's what we're trying to do now we're trying to make everybody see more clear what God has already said brother Branham you can write in your Bible he said I'd be Antichrist amen but to bring the Bible that we already have to where we can read it as a center and get saved but we can also read it and get meat because I promise you your body change lays in that Bible you got in your lap but it will not change you as long as you leave that Bible land in your lap hey man God does not want fellowship with a book he won't spell oh with somebody with skin on it hey man Adam didn't have a book in the in the beginning you think we're gonna have a booking in no you are the book what I want to bring today I want us to see this but let's stop and get a little head of myself now sanctification under the seals remember well let me finish my thought thank you lord but brother branham what did he do he come to do two things turn the hearts of the father's back to the children right or the children to the father's sorry children to the father's faith of the father so that we'd be more - or a father it's not a baby all right father's a mature man so he's bringing us back to that and then number two he's supposed to what literally he's supposed to bring the seven thunders at a literally turn us back so that's what he did in the breach like I said before there were many bursts in the seven churches they were all good they were all right according to their time amen but in this end time it's required that there be a birth from according to my life or a man I think I read that last Sunday fund seventy four left but there's a requirement now that we are to be literally what we have listened to listen to me what we have listened to all of our life has got to change it's got to change so I took a profit to turn a corner oh sure we can may oh yeah well Gary Krantz is not here but some of you builders I mean man I can put that wall up but turn a corner or cut an angle call a professional collects no I can't do that and that's what we had to do God had to call a professional brother branham with the Holy Ghost and the anointing of the Prophet not just any profit but the profit in the end time revelations ten seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to begin to sound so what did he do in that breach sure he preached Redemption but we're at the end of the church ages and we're getting ready to go into his greatest ministry that since Jesus Christ that's what he said he said I've never worked in this realm of anointing in my life he's seen 25,000 people get healed and saved at one time to me to me brother Donnie they'd be I'm done that's all I knew no that was just that was just what that was just the glare to get people to see the message so in the breach what did he do in the breach we told you before that what is a breech birth a breech birth is as the baby comes feet first that's not a normal birth but it is a birth the baby comes the baby is alive but that's not a normal birth watch the normal birth head first amen so the prophet of God was what he did I believe in Revelations 5 nobody ever seen this before he had to reach in not to a natural womb don't think perverted with me buddy what is the womb of a Christian your mind is your womb a man what God doesn't deal by the loins of man or women anymore not corruptible stuff like that but he deals in the womb of your mind so the prophet of God had to read literal he rescinded I don't know if he did you but he did me he reached into the womb of my mind and he changed my thinking hey man that's where God talks to me that's where the fertility of the bride is is in her mind the womb of her mind so God through a prophet a masterbuilder he said ok reached births are alright it's a birth but I want to introduce the head so the head had to come first those cells are the headstone to the church amen it's never been priests before so brother Branham couldn't preach it to the normal people he said it's gone from you you're not gonna get it I'm just telling you what he said on questions and answers on the seals and then he said it's gone from you you're not even supposed to get it and then it starts talking about voices coming through the room and there be a crystal and there's not the right crystal there at the time but I believe today ladies and gentlemen brothers and sister the crystal is here the right receptor is here to receive the days of the voice of the seventh angel he has turned us to where well we was going to die I told him I told bitkeeper friend of mine he said these three things this that will hinder your beekeeping ability he said these three people you don't want in your bee yard can't good and wouldn't so take it with a Christian experience I can't well you just stopped yourself I couldn't Jesus stopped yourself I would you've just stopped yourself I thought the Bible says we can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth and when God says all things he means all things amen so this sanctification when when the prophet of God then had to turn us to get that correct birth what did he bring he brought the seals right after that he brought him correct he brought him the way they were supposed to come but nobody got it what about preaching to a brother Larry you weren't there you weren't there wounded your youth everyone brother branham was here no okay well some of you were sister Cletus not here today but some of you were there brother hal was there when brother Branham preached a lot of times now if he'll tell you oh I'm sorry Larry and Larry and Jamie lariat Jeanie I was just gonna leave you alone since is your anniversary sighs don't leave me alone but listen I've heard I've heard people though out of their own mouth tell me they went to Jeffersonville to watch brother Branham and they didn't hardly listen to anything he said sermon they wanted to see the signs and wonders so it wasn't for them but it's for us it's for us more blessed it is him that did not see and receive what God's already brought they managed to ask me in you so listen as we compartmentalize this it wasn't for them to leave them alone they're gone actually most them are passed away but you know what brother Branham was not calling them was not saying they weren't Christians he just said you're not getting this it's not for you in other words the womb of your mind has been so polluted my ideas denominational ideas till I can't talk to you right now but they'll be a group they'll be a group that'll have the potential to hear exactly what I'm saying not compromise on anything that first seal identified that were a white righteous Church you see I'm not talking about what happened in the first three church ages like when we're reading in the book of Romans this morning he starts talking about those in Rome you know what I done I struck out Rome put Luther Georgia or wherever you live it's just a place so Paul was talking to the Saints at Lula brother branham's talking to the Saints at Lula wherever the true Word of God is preached not just here but I'm here now this is me all right so God speaking to me now there's no future age to come no more Church ages so there's not a future we can't say oh well I'll just take what I can get and I know some of you and I'm gonna say it will you love me or not if Henry Ford in nineteen when did he make the heimo Dhoni in 1908 if Henry Ford would have stood at the end of the production line and said well it is what it is it would have took some of you four or five hours to get to church in a car with no air conditioning no windshield wipers no radio I just can't stand that word I can't stand it is what it is I can't accept that I'm sorry I can't well we got to go put them in the grave because it is what it is see the mentality of our mind is going to be changed turned and it's only from the prophets message people man can't turn you because man's gonna put you in a grave we all got die sometime listen you believe that if you want to if I fall dead right now I'm still gonna believe that I'm gonna be here and God's gonna use me change my body and use me to call the dead out of the ground now that doesn't make me anything but it makes God that's got a group of people that's gonna believe what he's already said not one another preachers burner another prophet is bringing there's no other prophet Jesus Christ is it done all right but what is this seal the red horse rider is what we looked at sanctification sanctification under the seal is cleaned and set aside for service but less compartmentalize this again if you're Sol if you're born again it's in your soul at this moment I say that at this moment it's in your soul it doesn't need anything else SEC Tournament God is it actually is not as eternal as God is it is God and that makes it eternal hey man it is God and it makes it eternal there's a light there that doesn't shine anywhere else hey man I'd hate to be the Death Angel come get a Christian yeah amen cuz he's not used to coming and picking up about 5 million volts of eternal life he's used to walking in and grabbing a sinner and saying come on buddy you going in the 5th dimension and you're gonna wait here you filthy thing know when he meets that son and daughter of God when that flesh breaks back and that real person stands up and says death where's he staying grave where's your big trick you take me what brother brown say we control death even in the time that our body quits breathing that soul inside of that person says no I'm not going with you you're going to take me you gonna take me death into that 6th dimension where you don't know anything about cuz there's no death there if you look at even death like that death to a Christian is not o Lord of mercy that right see that's what I think it is all other death angels gonna come get me one day even if he does he can't touch you he can't touch that eternal life that's in your soul so where do you need sanctification you don't need it for this guy right you don't need it for this flesh guy cuz remember it just holds everything together so you need sanctification for what that metal man memory reason conscious affection imagination that's what these are doing they're driving out the trash that's left over in your spirit realm amen now we take the seal which is what there's a red horse power was given to take peace and to kill and it was given unto him a great sword that was given unto them a great word why because it deceived the people and then we just we finished this morning in Romans 1 whatever it was where that men hold the truth in unrighteousness they hold the truth but they hold it and twist it to unrighteousness hey man that's the problem today like we were talking this morning not brother Dale was 50 years ago taught us about interpolating you look in your Bible Paul is out Paul is writing a letter and all of a sudden there's a something in parentheses that's interpolation Paul is actually clear clarifying what God stands through him but it actually in Paul's in Paul's situation it's God expounding more because it's not Paul if it's in the Word of God it's not Paul that's God now you and I can interpolate and get it wrong then that's what happens to a lot of people they interpolate their own ideas and get it wrong but we you and I were given a great sword you and I are right now given a word a great word amen so so the the law of contrast if there was a white seem like white righteous church there had to be a white Rochester Church on earth so if there was a Red Rider that was that was riding through and killing people then there had to be there had to be a killing of self now listen those people in that for church hate people listen to me just to say they were a Christian was automatic physic automatic 68 million of them right that's equivalent to there's only like 16 no there's not there's 12 million people in the state of Georgia whole state five times that probably ever stayed on the eastern seaboard wiped out because of what they believe amen so the great sword that Satan was given was what to deceive the people but as that as we look back to that I see a great thing I see the word being fulfilled the court of wheat had to die go in the ground why so it could come back the right way amen you love the Lord amen so parallel in that fourth church age if you want to let's skip to number number four I know we went through this before I want to go through just another time number four let's just skip them all go to number four we've read these before but let's read this them number four is Redemption by judgment Jeffersonville Indiana oh if you notice red heifer notice being the female typing the church typing the church now you see topping the church so you're bringing it to the church cuz that's the problem we have the problem we have is is like I said before most message believers are tunas Jesus over here me over here well we know Jesus is God but can you say you are because if there's two people the prophet of God told us if you see that's what the seals revealed here stands a lamb and there goes somebody he said therefore that person must be the devil listen folks we have his answer more than anybody that's ever been on the face of this earth except Jesus Christ himself and I like to that's good you know what I'm not putting myself in that category God's putting me in that category amen being the female topping the church red the color had couldn't be spotted now and had to be a solid color and red always gives signifies redemption listen you say red always signifies danger it does to us in a red light but it's also redemption to do you know if there's not a red light there if you just keep driving through somebody t-bones you that's not redemption redemption is you stop and let the guy go by and then don't run it so red has always been the sign through the Bible remember the brothers preach the other night about Rahab did a wonderful job but he ever thought about that you were here brother that brother brought a wonderful job didn't know that we were talking about the about sanctification or the red blood but you take Rahab you and I everyone were Rahab every one of us I don't care if you were so pure no you were purely dead hey man if you were pure anything you were purely dead I like that I think I'll use that again you were purely dead but you take Rahab the harlot how in the world could you bring a lineage through a prostitute she knew a lot of men but she'd not met Salman yet and then when she did meet Salman she said hey Salman see you know I'm Rahab they called me the harlot he said I don't care what people call you he said what are you because he looks behind him and he looks out and he sees Jericho there's no walls there anymore but there's one little thing sticking up there's one remember their houses were against the wall Rahab's house wouldn't bother so there's one little there's one little piece sticking up and he sees a red string he didn't see nothing else he sees that red string hanging down and he said I don't see anything I don't see anything but red where's your accusers at Rahab she said the old dead he said well I don't see them and I didn't see you do it so let's get married amen amen [Applause] that's ask people we all carry baggage but without that red of that sanctifying blood to cover us were no match for the devil but brother Brown said one second in front of God and he'll annihilate us just like that why because remember this is not so this is not supposed to happen the first three dimensions of this world we live in and so I said I hope you see this you can't get a revelation in this dimension a true revelation from God has to come from that eternal dimension called the true revelation is eternal and that's what we're lacking folks we're lacking that eternal revelation that'll change our body amen redemption Jesus wisest they throw the girl down in front of him we caught her in the act I saw him I'm his neighbor I saw her I'm her I'm here I'm her neighbor yeah what Jesus do this Jesus would have seen that he'd had a killed her too but he got rid of her accusers who is I accuser one guy satan is our tutor but when God looks through read he sees white Amen he says all I see is the red brother Brown said that was what there was a red streak that went around the earth and he hears our voice Amen right that all right say Amen let's read number five back in the Old Testament they had a red heifer told Moses when they started this journey said now make a provision for the cleaning cleansiness spell that for the cleansiness of the people as they journeyed on for it they do do wrong they're out of fellowship now apply that to us cuz remember look let me go back to less compartmentalize your soul cannot lose eternal life your soul is just as eternal as God is it is God cannot sin will not sin doesn't have a bad day doesn't have one of those like my brother Nell said if you curse it didn't come from the inside no but you got that spirit realm that lives in this earth that you got to deal with that's what these are for us to kick that trash out but in the Old Testament that red heifer told Moses when they started the journey saying I'll make a provision for the cleansiness of the people as they journey on for if they do do wrong and you will I'll say that I'm interpolating there they're out of fellowship now this is under the blood of bulls and goats but there's a provision there and before they can fellowship I want you to make a water of separation then Moses commanded to take a red heifer a young heifer oh I want you to notice the word red means something to you and I read means danger but read in the Bible means redemption redemption through the blood all the way from Genesis to revelations you know everybody's worried about brother Branham you know he supposedly he was supposed to come out to jail surveil and preached the trail of the serpent I really don't care I really don't I can see it myself I don't need a prophet to tell me he told me what was wrong in Genesis but also he told me what was right from Genesis let us make man in our own image and after our likeness let him have dominion over the fish and see in the file there that man is living still today in you that is you that all right say ma'am that is you not a second person all right Matthew 12 when the unclean spirits going out of a man we words like black he's not even here in the statement I run to my of the state member he was sitting here and I said when the unclean spirit goes out of a man I threw him over there across them and that's what happens now in your sanctification to come into the body of Christ that's sealed and filled up with God so you don't have to worry about that no more let's compartmentalize that we're not talking about sanctification to clean you and set aside for service for God to fill you with the Holy Ghost that's not we're talking about now we're up higher we're talking about our daily walk we're talking about this statue of a perfect man because Paul I mean Peter he said I'm talking to you that have the divine nature of God brother Dale read it this morning now if you got the divine nature of God where's the problem 9 your soul it's in your spirit realm thank God in Ephesians that the word is a divider send us a prophet to divide the soul in the spirit you know it doesn't say anything about the flesh see we're worried about this thing we set to sermon after sermon after sermon of beating this guy to death you get the Holy Ghost inside him sure you're still gonna have problems but brother Brown said you can't get a Holy Ghost field woman to put on a pair of pants you can't get a Holy Ghost field woman to cut her hair so point made point taken you still wearing pants sisters I don't condemn you you ain't got the whole ego you cut your hair that means trimming you don't have a holla go point mate point taken so I don't have to preach about it no more we heard sermons and sermons trying to get this thing lined up forget it folks right mark really he works outlook but it's like me they go more this way now than it does this way why because that's the fall that we live in that ain't got nothing to do with the man the person amen so our problem is is were what did Jesus say he said don't worry what you eat goes out to draw right he said but from the heart proceedeth from the heart proceedeth all things in other words they meant mmm so where was I Matthew when the unclean spirit is going out of man walks through Dry places seeking rest - no you say do you have unclean spirit yes I have unclean spirit they just don't reside where they used to reside they found another place remember brother Branham preached doors in doors when you get the Holy Ghost you let God in your house but you don't let him in that door right there because you don't want him to see your dirty laundry you don't want him in that door but now I'll open this door that's easy but I won't open that one that's what he preached and Lissa's the Holy Ghost is a gentleman you know the Holy Ghost if I was the Holy Ghost boy thank God I'm not he go let me in that door amen that's what we try to do we try to convert people by kicking the door down but when the sweetness of God comes you thank God I got things behind this door that I want you to take care of amen and the people out there think we're leaving but that's what it is that's how easy it is though you open the door and he said okay I'll help you okay I'll help you amen that's what I'm talking about that's the seal the second seal to me is that you let God in all those doors and there's nothing to hinder what he's willing to do from the inside out [Music] hey he's already in there he just wants to work he wants full fellowship done alright we'll get to a little bit more I'm gonna skip something if I'm gonna go to the last part here and then we'll close give everybody time to get out I went through this I want you to just listen to me for a minute then we're gonna read it if you will go to first Peter 1:22 or brother Dale read this morning you'll have to skip a bunch and get down to where brother Adam talks on the time of decision but listen they'll find it in a minute I think Nate's back there wake up Nate I like it when these people learn listen well we got people that leave and go tile of to have diversity that people can go back there and help out and this one can go teach son just go man we didn't have it when we first wouldn't come to church here daddy was the preacher song leader if he could have played the piano he would and he can't play guitar he must not be a message preacher he ain't been in jail he ain't picked the guitar he can't play a piano and he can't sing me too [Music] maybe I woke some of you up a little bit all right look so let's finish this let's not finish it but let's bring it to a point I want you to watch this point because remember the property God preached the token now the token is why what was this what was the example of the token in the Old Testament the man of the house went and killed the lamb took the blood and went over the doorpost now when the Death Angel came by he couldn't go in that door because he was what he was shielded by the blood now I like that that's ok but let's reach in the womb of our mind and turn to just a little bit I don't want the token over my door he didn't save him people inside did it but if I never get the token inside put that token inside that's why so sure we pray for our children we pray for Kidron pray for my children but you know what I say God you go get them forget about the building forget about the car they're driving this is the building I'm worried about right here I want the token on display not over my door I want the token on display here see so maybe they'll change her our thinking a little bit because watch you say brother we'll have no authority to do that here we go - can't cut in the wooden again listen we got become believers in what God's already said believers in what God's already saying I'm not telling you one thing you probably never heard before ok if I did then you know what God's bringing something to your memory watch this seeing you purified your souls I'm seeing you what purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit and unfailing love of the Brethren see that you love one another a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed so not mama not daddy but of incorruptible by the Word of God which is the incorruptible seed which liveth into by the forever look for all the flashes there's grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass flesh flesh flesh the grass withereth look the grass withereth unless you have one of these daddy told his 80 year old sister one time said if you have one more facelift said your belly button is gonna be right here but you know what that's just propping it up she's laying in the grave now sorry that's just propping up the flash get the inside man listen that inside person has no wrinkles that insight lessen that inside person is no more dead than anything it's alive that Genesis 1:26 man has never got one second old from the day God said it we're still in the day of God for all flesh is grass the grass withers and flower therefore but what but the Word of God the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you now I'm gonna declare something to you today that the prophet of God is already declared but I'm gonna read what he said all right time at decision 1959 now this is 1959 before the seals broke but watch what he says go to the next quote but wonder why that Rebecca came before any other girl just I might Rebecca nothing did you know that Rebecca and Isaac was blood relation cousins and the bride of Jesus Christ his blood relation to him a blood-bought bride no wonder she was led by the spirit there was a connection coming together there was a union coming together that's the reason I think today that the born-again the the Holy Ghost filled people is connected with God and are led by the Spirit of God that's why they act so peculiar to the people they've made their decisions remember sanctification is the decision you make you can't justify yourself but you can come under sanctification which is cleaning and set aside for service all right so it's something that you do they're going to go they made their decisions they're going to go on out regardless that the rest of them don't go out they're going anyway I like that don't care if this one walks or that one walks I'm going to walk anyway don't care where the one in other words look the life is in the blood and the life is in the church the Christian that's born again by the Spirit of God that's the spirit of life blood relation to Christ the Spirit of Christ in the blood of Christ leading a child of Christ the seed of Abraham that's why they move accurately that's why the world thinks so that's why the world thinks strange of us we say I'm not gonna die go tell somebody you're not gonna die Betsy some of you older ones go tell somebody you ain't gonna die oh really okay well that's fine here you know what that's gonna happen folks it's going to happen I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me let's go the next when crisis the mystery of God reveal now notice now here is after the seals broke he said if you don't get the seals right he said come back to this message right here Christ is the mystery of God revealed preached several months after the seals watch what he says now making it known how ma there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice the tree of Christ's body in the garden making now making his mystery known to this bride tree watch redeemed by Christ the second Adam you believe he was congregation says they men going back home to Eden with his fallen wife his Rahab is fallen wife that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back you see we're not talking about sanctification cleaning set aside for service we're talking about so sanctified you didn't do it now listen grace doesn't mean you got away with something you did it you know you did it but there is a change coming to where we're gonna have to believe that God knows it doesn't happen God knows it didn't happen he said what sins you talking about because remember if he can remember your sin he can take you to judgment come on people if he can remember one sin you have he can take you to judgment and say you didn't do what I said that's why I tell you the greatest revelation I ever had other than being born again was that I don't have to stand before the judgment my prophet told me and I can look in the Bible and see it now then I don't have to stand judgment he stood judgment for me and if he's sinless if he is virtuous if he is God Almighty what does that mean me what does that make me because remember a judgment we don't stand like this because it takes two people one to judge and wanted to be judged right but we're him made manifest in another form called a variety doesn't matter how many standing behind him there today of judgment we are judging the world cross manifesting in the church all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again this is not in heaven Adam and Eve didn't reside in heaven they resided on earth which are one made out of the same blood same spirit and everything else goes remember Adam and Eve literally were one person same DNA same blood same everything it drive a chemist crazy if they were to take both blood sample right but now watch the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word that all right say ma'am I like that now let's go to the next one last one and then we I don't have to read the one where brother Brown says you're you're not saved by the blood right you're kept saved by the blood the sanctifying condition alright now watch the token this last one then we'll stand water blood and spirit come when the mother gives birth to the baby the first thing breaks a normal birth is water the second thing is blood and next thing is life there come from the body of our Lord Jesus water blood life and the whole church the bride together has been made up through justification I want this church I want y'all to know one thing I want the world to know I believe in sin killing salvation through justification sanctification in the baptismal oligo you know why because I'm put it all in the Bible I put it all in the prophets message and I don't have to deny nothing amen what we get justified for if we've already had this eternal something we were eternal in the word people we were darling the word is the seed I think we forget where we came from which is the token as Hebrews 11 said all these who wandered about in CC and goatskin they were destitute all these things they'd done yet was not made perfect without us you got that listen to me I'm telling you they without us I don't need Hebrews 11:40 I know this for a fact they without us cannot be made perfect and if hold on a minute I thought they were in another dimension and they were perfect I'm so much a born again they're not gonna be perfected without us you see what we got to have on this side it's more than just a perfection of the soul anybody in the sixth dimension folks anybody from the first church age all the way up that's in the sixth dimension they're just as eternal as God is amen waiting us to come to a place to believe what God's already said bring them out of the ground to connect back with their body let's be changed I think I'm reading scripture if you don't believe that or not that's to be changed and then we're all to just step over into another dimension and let God well not let God actually really man's gonna destroy itself man's gonna destroy itself no other reason it the only reason that Hawaii is not sunk is because of me and you the only reason California hadn't sunk us me and you but when we leave this place pardon my expression all hell's gonna break loose because we livin in hell anyway this is Satan's Eden I really love it Satan came down into God's Eden and messed it up now God has turned around and went right down into Satan's eating and he's messed it up thank God for that and he's doing it through what no book not a quote through you and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the blood has been shedding that the holy ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot raise but they're depending on us for God promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there I am that person y'all or not okay you decide if you want to I don't know who it's going to be but somebody is going to receive it the only one thing I'm responsible is to preach it and he did a wonderful job amen now he's give it to all of us so that we can break it down so that you guys can understand it's you it's God's business to look out for that predestinated see there is going to be there though because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water aids the blood edge and now the token age of the Holy Ghost list and that's what you're carrying today you're carrying the life of God in your soul and the sanctifying power of the blood is what covers you then all right say man that's what covers you cuz they without us and I like what brother Brown said right there there's going to be there though because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water raise the blood agent now the token so now look folks the token then is not applied over your doorpost that's okay or over your car it's applied in you in you I'll be with you even on you that's not what he said he said I'll be with you even in you to what the day we take the change other musicians come I don't know brother boys if you have a song we can we can sing what can wash away my sin because remember only Christians have sins what's prophet said we sin every day brother Ram do your sin every day so what keeps him going what keeps him sanctified the washing of the water of the world and then that word will wash you and brother branham said and I'll look it up we'll get it next Sunday he calls it the bleeding word because it's a saint to fire a man if I you know what if I have a question sure we ask ministers but go to God brother branham said if you got a question God to put somebody in the pulpit and how many times does that happen a hundred for me have a question in a word of God and somebody step up they're not even knowing they were saying they were accusing me and brother Chris of talking before the before the service because actually he was preaching on revelations five the night the weekend before but I had my Bible and I walked down and I handed it to the very same guy he handed it to that Sunday before and said the same thing he said so they accused us of talking no we didn't talk that's the eternal Word of God where men don't have to sitting and talk to each other I mean yeah you can talk about the word but I'm talking about you know me and dad don't get together on Saturday night goes I'm gonna say what are you gonna preach tomorrow no we just let her go and then and if we're led of God you know what he'll put it together I promise well yeah 2:45 in the red boot do 45 in the red book let's things let's take a couple of verses if you
