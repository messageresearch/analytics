continue you to bless brother Wade and sister Jun as they're traveling just bring them back safely Lord we commit it all into your hands and ask it in Jesus Christ name amen amen praise the Lord let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 Hebrews 11:30 it says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days notice the key thing there is by faith the walls of Jericho there was no problem for God to knock him down it was the faith that the children of Israel that God was trying to work trying to work on lifting up that Faith he could take care of the walls of Jericho so it's the same with your life he could take care of any situation in your life it's just he's working on that Faith amen you and our faith you know we we sometimes we have we we we we have weak Faith but but God is trying to work on that Faith so by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about 7 days and by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace amen and then also while you're standing in James chapter 2 verse 25 and 26 James 2:25 the Bible says likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also amen may God add a blessing to the reading of your word you may be seated this a this evening amen I want to speak this evening I want to talk about faith that seizes the moment faith that seizes the moment amen you know and if you want to if you want to uh uh Listen to A good sermon brother Brandon preached amen his his uh Works uh uh Works expressed by faith I believe is the title of it um Works Express faith in 1965 and um and so he he mentions a lot about about this but I want to talk about this evening uh about faith seizing the moment and you know here in James chap 2: 26 it says for as the body without the spirit is dead amen so you know you take a body you know that has not the spirit amen you could pretty much just say that it's dead you know it's not functioning because the spirit is what is what is where the realm of the emotions are and the realm of the of the of the of the love and and and and hate and those different types of uh uh emotions and so if all that is is not there amen you might as well just consider the body dead you know and and so but so Faith so James types it in with so faith without works is dead also amen praise God you you we can all say that we have faith amen we all we we say oh we're we we're fighting for the faith you see we're we're we're Marching for Faith or we're we're we're we're pressing amen we're fighting this this battle of Faith amen or we have faith and and I believe that we all do otherwise you wouldn't be here amen you have faith in somewhat at least in the word of God Amen that that it can do something for you otherwise you would not use your time you could be better go off and play putt putt right now or or go do something go wash your car you know enjoy this nice weather amen but you have faith in the word amen that it it can that it can say something and to change your life change your situation change amen your motives maybe something that you're praying about amen whatever it may be you have faith that the word of God Amen that you come here to listen amen can do something for you praise God so faith without works is dead also and the the the fact that you came to church shows that your faith is in action amen praise God and that's what James is saying that your faith if you say that you have faith then you must show action behind that Faith amen there there is no such thing as silent Faith praise God or sometimes we might think that that Faith oh it's just something silent I have faith you know I have faith but really true faith it it it stands out there's actions behind true Faith amen amen praise God you you see Faith amen when there is true Faith why brother brand said faith has hair in its chest praise God that's that's that's kind of disgusting I guess but but but you know when you see a hair on your chest you know you know some women are I don't know about that but but you see it there and and it's manifested right and it means it's Burly you see something that's Burly something that's strong something that has Faith amen and and and I've been around brothers and sisters and and and you know you can't help to be to be love to be around them because they just boost your faith right up amen they have so much confidence in their walk with God they have so much confidence in the word of God their experience has brought them to that point that you can't just you can't help but walk in the same in the same anointing that they're in amen praise God so faith without works is dead you must show amen that you have if you have faith amen if you believe that this word is true then let let us see the results of that Faith amen right praise God now uh there's another part in Romans where where where it talks about you know that that faith amen you need Faith Amen in order for for salvation amen and and that and that works don't don't help that Faith but you see we you need you need them both amen praise God you need faith and you need the works praise God faith when God Amen is looking that the RO where where where Paul was talking about that faith in Romans is when God's looking at your faith amen James here is talking about when man sees what you're doing praise God you see that the works that you manifest is what you and I see praise the Lord you say you have faith in the word of God Amen let's see you manifest it then right and that's the scary part that's the part it's easy to read it and I'll just take it in I have faith Lord amen but when it really comes down to the hot water do you really have faith amen that and that's that's what God is trying to do and I believe even the things that we're seeing nowadays amen is coming down to that point where everything that you said you have it's going to be squeezed out of you some way or another amen praise the lord it's going it's going to be sque squeezed out of you and you've got to have faith in what God has given you what you have believed amen praise the Lord those are the times I believe that people are going to are going to leave this faith and they're and you're going to see people manifesting uh really who they are the Judas is and we're seeing it now they cannot take on the the the the you know the everything that that's going on they think it's just too harsh the the the the preachers are just too much and everything like that so what do they do they just leave that really shows that they didn't really have faith in this word like they said they did oh they shouted about it oh you saw them yelling uh shouting and running the AES and they were upfront amen and jumping up and down and everything back in the 80s and 90s but where they are now where are they at now you see so Faith amen true Faith amen stands stands in the m in the midst of no matter what the situation is praise the Lord amen and and I'm just wondering if any one of you has ever had to make a decision amen where uh like right on the spot I mean I know that I have many times you know you you you have to make a a a decision and you don't have time to even think about you know what what what what the what the uh what the um what uh what's the outcome of that choice is going to be but you just commit it to the Lord and you say Lord this is what I'm doing and I'm just moving on Amen and sometimes God puts us in those places amen where you have to make a split second decision amen but God blesses that decision amen praise the Lord amen and and so um and so we're looking at here at faith that seizes the moment and and I was just looking at this word seize and you know this is where we get the word seizure and which means a sudden attack or spasm amen it's a sudden and uh it happens all of a sudden but but there's a there's another there's another uh uh a couple of more definitions and it says physically taking control of something Often by force amen physically taking control of something Often by force uh and I like this this one grasping an opportunity or a moment amen grasping an opportunity or a moment and when you grasp something you're not Loosely grabbing onto it you're fully taking of hold of it amen where you won't let it go amen I'm reminded of Jacob Amen in the in in the Old Testament amen where he would not let go amen of when God appeared to him as a man and he wrestled he was in despair Jacob was he was in despair because he was getting ready to meet his his brother Esau and it had been years that he had not seen him and he had already his his wives and and the Lord had blessed him but now being that he had was blessed he had money he had he had family his he had lots of possessions and things and and and and yet he was scared to go see his brother because he knew that he had done his brother wrong but we knew that it was part of the uh part of the of the plan of God and so Jak Amen in despair he goes up into that top of the mountain or that hill and as he's praying amen the man appears in front of him and and and and and and he realizes something grabs a hold of Jacob amen something in his heart told him that's God Amen that that's got to be God that that can't be anyone else it's got to be God and he took of he took a hold of him and started wrestling with him amen and wrestling with him he did and and and and and they wrestled all night the Bible said but he would not let it go he said he said the man said let me go and he said I will not let you go until you bless me amen I don't think he was asking a a regular man for that blessing he he had to know that that was God Amen and it was God praise God how did he know it was something that had come down down to his heart spark it sparked faith enough to to be able to grab him and and not let him go and stay and fight all night long amen and I'm wondering if you and I are willing to do that Amen in our in our Christian walk this evening amen are you willing how much are you willing to fight for what belongs to you how much what are you willing to do Amen to obtain that promise that God has given you amen just like Jacob amen I will not let you go Lord until you give me a sure word and something amen that I could go face my brother with well he gave him even more than that amen right praise God he gave him a an assurance amen even in so much that it changed his walk from that day forward amen that's right praise God physically and so how much are you willing to do amen with with just like just like Jacob amen he took hold of God's of God's uh uh of God's word and of God's promise praise the Lord you know I I like I like sister uh I like what sister Hattie wrright did amen we all know the story of sister hady Wright and brother brandom's well let me read you this last position this last uh um um definition here of the word sees taking legal possession of property through Authority amen amen you know Satan doesn't belong in your property right it doesn't belong Amen in your house doesn't belong in Amen to your children amen you have the right by God's word to take a hold of that property because it belongs to you amen praise the Lord Jesus so brother Bram says here in the message but I I have heard but now I see speaking about how he write and he said and I said you've got a father and mother setting here that's old you haven't got any money ask for the money and see if it comes in your lap ask for your sister and see if she don't get up and walk and then brother BR says I knew then I like that I knew then like job there's just something you know when you strike it amen there's just something that you know amen that it seemed like that that's what happened to Jacob there something that he knew that when you strike it amen praise God when you know when you strike it said I know in other words you know that you know amen praise God and that was the reason why brother brand could say Hade ask whatever you want amen and God will give it to you right here and then amen what what what kind of uh person amen would would dare ask that to a human being amen but but brother brandham felt amen that anointing something struck him amen and it was real and he knew praise the Lord and that's the thing that we need to know amen not not just think that we know we know amen before we act on our faith praise God because brother Bram said that faith is a revelation amen I always like to think of a revelation as kind of like as something that curtains opening and you see everything in plain view praise God everything in plain view it's no secret and so when you see something in plain view amen there is nothing hidden from you so you could say I know and you can act upon that right there and then amen praise God that's why brother BR always say faith is a revelation amen because when it's revealed to you and it's true Faith you then go and have the Assurance to go act upon that Faith amen amen praise God but when it's not true Faith amen then you're teetering on it amen and you're not sure and and sometimes you know in the in the mission field and in other you know other places you can really see sometimes the people that come up for prayer and you're praying for them prayer lines you can you can see in the people's faces even the faith that they have or the lack of thereof because some of them as they come and tell you about their problem and things like well I hope that God can do this for me I I I think that he can but I want you to pray for me you know but then there's some that said I know that God can do it for me but pray with me brother away from me and hey man it lifts your faith up praise God you see and it makes you act differently it makes you act crazy when you have true Faith amen it makes you act ridiculous and it makes you talk different and it makes you talk different amen and and ridiculous but amen that is how true Faith works praise the lord it's ridiculous amen but it works hallelujah amen and brother Bram said I knew then like job there is just something you know when you strike it said I know here I stand before about 10 people and know and so there was other people there when when he asked sister how do you write that I said if this doesn't happen then I'm a false prophet he's putting his own reputation on the line amen you better know amen what you're talking about praise the Lord said what shall I ask sister Hatty Wright asked and then he said he said to her it's up to you to make your decision I cannot make your decision I want to tell you that what shall I ask I don't know what to do amen well you know the word of God Amen if you know go forth with it amen and take a hold of the promise and it's up to you if you do it or not amen keep confessing keep believing amen confession amen when you're confessing the promise and when that that that is you amen applying that promise promise and that faith is building up amen as you keep confessing how are you feeling when somebody comes to you I feel wonderful amen and you might be feeling the most rotten that you've ever felt amen I feel wonderful amen because why I know God paid the price for my healing amen and I know that the healing is there I'm just waiting for it to manifest amen I know that my children are not there amen but I know they are they are there at the same time because God gave them to me already amen I know it praise the Lord amen that's your that's that's confession amen praise God and and the whole world will see amen everybody will see if you truly have faith or not and when you have that true Faith amen it lifts and helps others as well amen praise God God help us Amen to be more positive in our in the way we speak and the way we we we uh the way we we we we carry out ourselves about the promises of God Amen I said it's up to you to make your decision I cannot make your decision and she looked around the little woman and and all at once notice and all at once she said brother brandham the greatest desire in my heart is the Salvation of my two boys amen so everything amen she could probably brother brandham had put her right on the spot right right on the spot amen ask what you will sister Hattie I feel it i' it struck me amen and if you don't if and if God doesn't give you what you ask for you call me a false prophet amen and she was put right on the spot can you imagine that can you imagine being put on the spot by a prophet of God to say to to ask whatever you want it's in your lap you can ask for money you can ask for the for for the healing of your sister you can ask for the for the your parents healing whatever you want amen and what and what she asked for amen was something that was already in her heart and it was the salvation of her two of her two children amen nothing nothing about herself nothing about money amen it was about the benefit of someone else that she loved amen praise God that must have already been in her heart the reason why she asked that she said brother BR the greatest desire in my heart is the Salvation of my two boys I said give you I give you your boys in the name of Jesus Christ and them snickering laughing fun making boys fell across their mother's lap and surrendered their life to God and was filled with the Holy Ghost right there and and and brother Bram said that there they were snickering laughing making fun and they fell across their mother's lap amen repenting so it doesn't matter what your kids are doing today amen these kids were making fun of what was going on right there and God struck them right there at that moment right God can take care of your daughter God can take care of your of your son no matter what they're doing right now amen he can make that pillow so hard that they have no other choice but to come to God Amen and I pray that that for all our our L loved ones amen praise the lord lord make that pillow so hard at night that they just don't they have no other choice Lord but but to just come to God Amen they know your word amen and that that word something Sparks in them and they realize I need God amen amen praise the Lord I need my own conviction I need my own experience with God and if God could do it for those two children those two boys sister Hat's uh two boys amen what can he do for you and I what can you do for our children amen who still have hope who still come to church you know and they listen to the word amen they may not be snickering laughing and making fun of of of of Christianity amen but how much more if he can do it for these kind of kids how much more for your kids amen amen keep bringing them to church keep letting them hear the word don't stop telling them about God Amen keep being aike to them parents amen and I believe that God that whatever you do will not will not return back void that's right whatever you do that's out based from the word of God and that has to do with God Amen they'll see it and it will not return back void praise the Lord amen so just keep that Faith amen for your lost loved ones amen praise the Lord Jesus so we're talking about faith that seizes the moment faith that takes advantage of the moment faith that sees the moment amen and faith that that that says if I don't strike now amen I don't know when I'm going to amen that's what we're talking about Amen to take a hold of the moment amen and and you know one person that that that I believe that did that typed this or that did this so perfectly was Rahab amen and the Bible praise God we could we could be here all night you know just reading the whole the whole uh scriptures here amen but maybe we'll just read a little bit and kind of skip down there you can read that in Joshua chapter 2 in Joshua chapter 2 and it says and Joshua the son of nun sent out of shum two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into an harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there you know you may ask you know why is it that that that they ended up in a harlot's house you know a prostitute's house amen well it must have been that God LED them there there's no other there's no God LED them there amen it was for no other reason amen but for what we see in the in in the next several verses amen praise God and it was God that led them there amen and it says in verse two and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country amen praise the Lord and you know I I kind of see the the these two spies uh if if you just want to kind of type things out I kind of see them kind of like the five-fold ministry amen right they went out amen and they preached amen and and and and they and it was this Harlot amen that received amen what they had to say right praise God but but we'll just keep reading I won't get ahead of myself and it says and in verse three and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they becomes to search out all the country so it must have been that the king or his servants they knew Rahab personally because they went straight to their house Amen to ask if she knew anything about these men and and it's very interesting because her house according to to to history and according to the commentaries rahab's house was the Bible says that it was built on on on on top of the top of the wall but if you really in some other translations it says that it was built into the wall so it seems more you know and I saw I looked online and I saw some pictures of what they possibly think it could still be rahab's house standing I don't know if it is or not but uh it seems to make more sense sense that the house was built right into the wall or next to the wall not necessarily on top because the Bible says that she hid the spies on top of the roof on top of the place so it makes more sense it feels kind of on the side or at least touching against the wall right or part of the wall and you just think about that well I won't get ahead of myself again here think about that the walls fell and not her house my goodness and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came man unto me so she told him half truth but I wish not WCE they were in other words she was lying she she you wouldn't think that it God would use this type of woman to do to have this kind of Faith Amen to to to to do what she's about to do because she was a harlot she she she um she was just one of the least persons that you'd think amen that that she would do what she was about to do but it's who God used Amen to do what she did and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark verse 5 that the man went out with the whether the man went this is her still telling the king in them and whether the man went I what not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the man pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the forge and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate amen Rahab deliberately went out of her way to save these two men what what what what caused her to do so what struck her what was revealed to her amen that these two men uh uh uh they can help me and they can help my family praise God and you know God didn't even count you don't even see she just lied right she just lied to the king she just she she's a harlot she's doing all kinds of stuff but yet you don't find none of that anything everything that we just read in the New Testament about Rahab didn't speak about none of those things because it's all under the blood amen in verse eight and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof now pay attention to this part in verse n and she said unto the man I know that's key I know that the Lord hath given you the land she's she's not an Israelite she's a Canaanite she's a gentile right but she says I know I know something just struck her amen just like brother Braham something struck he said I know something struck Hatty right I know amen that desire is in me amen praise God and said I know the Lord ha given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you see they've heard they they heard and she tells them that they had heard the next verse for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan sihon and OG whom ye utterly destroyed she was telling them the word of the Lord back to them right the things that she had heard the word of God the god working in that m in the in the children of Israel that day amen she was telling them back to them and something amen caused her to believe that she wasn't there she wasn't part of the army of the children of Israel she wasn't with Moses she wasn't with Joshua amen but she only hearing made her realize this is this is the truth amen amen praise God this is this is true and when she knew that those two spies were part of the children of Israel she did everything she could Amen to get get them make sure that they were safe praise God you see how Faith amen spontaneous Faith amen puts you into action amen when you truly have faith in what God Amen this woman had not even seen the things that that that God had done yet she believed blessed are your eyes for they have they have not seen the things that have happened but yet you believed amen praise God you believe that the that the word of God Amen this word of God can do something for you that that God Amen can change the situation in your life no matter what it is amen and you have not even maybe experienced anything in your life or even seen the things that have happened in the word all you've done is just read them or hear them from behind the pulpit yet you believe you're blessed right amen you and I are blessed Saints praise God for we have heard how the Lord DED up the water of the Red Sea to you when you came out of Egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side Jordan sihon and OG whom you utterly destroyed you know it reminds me of of of the woman at the well when Jesus came to her and she what did she tell him we we know we know that when Messiah comes he'll tell us these things amen she had heard amen the word amen as maybe she was coming up as a little girl she she'd heard the word and and she knew that it was real she knew that it was truth amen and she she had that hope in her in her heart amen that it was real it was it was God working in in in in in in Rahab maybe from a little girl she she didn't want to be a harlot I mean I I don't I don't know if I don't know of any any Harlot that that would want to be a harlot she just she she was more concerned about her family she was doing it amen so that to provide for her family her parents her her her brothers amen she didn't want to do that what was really in her heart was God was something was something that that that's cried out about God Amen and and this was the opportunity that she had Amen to maybe experience God in her life and to also save her family verse 11 and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God this is her confession after the things she heard for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath man that's her confession never probably does didn't even know her name never walked with Moses never even ate the Mana or nothing all she did was heard and it struck her Amen to do something for those two spies those two men of God Amen praise the Lord I wonder what we do amen as the word of God is going forth from behind the pulpit what do we do amen what do we take claims amen of the word of God Amen like this woman amen when the when the two spies went to her amen she had already heard amen she knew these were men of God praise the Lord and she took advantage Amen to make sure amen that she treated them well she did everything she could amen because she wanted a blessing that praise the Lord amen amen wonder if we respect the man of God that way right that's right are we just kind of just brush him off that's just brother Aaron that's just brother Wade you know it's another sermon amen that they were preaching amen or do we truly have respect for the word that's going for because it's not the man amen if you're here to listen to me amen I'm I'm sorry amen I hope you're getting something out of this tonight amen praise God Amen that's right brother and so that word amen that that word that that that that she heard amen it it was real to her amen because you know that that woman at the well amen wasn't when she heard that word amen when that word came to the word amen as brother brandham says praise God she'd heard the word the word was there that brother brandham said that that that that representation of predestination was right there with her and when she heard the word and then the word came and man confirmed the thing what did she do she just sat right there like some of you all right now no oh she she dropped what she was doing she dropped her bucket she went she went to town and she didn't care amen who was going to make fun of her she didn't care amen if anybody anybody didn't believe her amen she said come and see a man who's told me everything that I've done isn't this the very Messiah amen praise the Lord that's what she did amen she went in there amen with full assurance and Faith amen that this man amen can help me and if he's helped me he can help you right and that's what Rahab did too amen praise God she she she didn't go back Amen to her Harlot ways she didn't go back to her amen she just she she went and got into action her faith amen put her into action Amen to do something for those men of God and she got results praise the Lord now therefore I pray you verse 12 therefore I pray you this is Rahab still talking swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token praise the Lord a true token and Rahab meant business with God and I wonder if we mean business with the Lord amen that way or is this just just a game amen for you just to come Sunday and Wednesday and is just go go through the motions go through the routine amen come up and play the instrument and then and you know leave at the end of the service and then amen what do you do after you leave the service amen what do you do at home do you have your own personal time with God amen amen praise the Lord or is it your or your religion is just here at church right amen there's something wrong then truly really something wrong if you don't desire amen a relationship with God Amen outside of these four walls that's right amen praise God right because it should be a personal relationship with God you know brother the in Isaiah 1:18 it says the Lord speaking he says come now and let us reason together says the Lord man in other words you you truly mean business I'll mean business too amen I'll mean business if you mean business man let's come at the table let's talk about it let's discuss it amen a true businessman amen he he's not there playing games amen with the person he wants them to sign for the loan or get the program or buy the car amen he's not there snickering and laughing and and and cutting up amen when when he really wants to make that business deal you see amen but then that's what that's how God is with you and I amen you really want God I got God I got God to give you but you really need to want it amen let's sit down on the table let's do your part I'll do mine amen repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins amen and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the Bible says amen Hallelujah that's right amen and brother brand says it like this in works is Faith expressed that's the message that I was trying to think of of earlier says I want to tell you something now work on that pulsation that spur of a moment amen like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all those just that moment when something is revealed to you amen that remember faith is a revelation when something is revealed to you grab it amen seize it amen it's yours amen what if Rahab just wait waited oh those are the two spies of of of Israel and well I'll just go back and you know do my night shift tonight and you know would have probably missed the opportunity right amen but she she she dropped what she was doing the woman at the well dropped what she was doing amen and grabbed and seized it amen seized what what what the opportunity praise God like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all those just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it hold it that spur of a moment amen that that that's key that spur of the moment amen when you feel like all things are possible how how many have ever felt that way praise God let let's wake up come on Amen let's say Amen or something how many have ever felt amen uh that way maybe even while you're praying amen or or you know you you get you get that that that that that Faith amen like my goodness you can go and definitely move a mountain amen praise God I I've felt that way before you and it's in those moments amen you take a hold of that momenten we know that all things are possible to them that believe amen but there is those times amen when Revelation just just is so great and it feels like you can just be on top of the world world Amen and nothing no you're you're unstoppable amen praise God take a hold of that moment just like Peter amen when he saw Jesus amen walking on water and he wasn't sure it was Jesus but he asked him he said Lord if it's you bid me to come amen if it's you Lord if it's you as you're praying Lord amen amen bid me to come amen help my faith help my unbelief help me to believe your word Lord because on my own I struggle but Lord bid me to come open back the the curtains amen and and let me see you clearly so that I can have faith amen for my children faith for my for my family faith for what I need amen praise God let me see you clear let me see your word clearly amen amen and and and Jesus didn't say anything else to him didn't preach the Seven Seals to them he he didn't he didn't go over Daniel 70 weeks he didn't do anything he just told him he said come right that's all he said one word amen can change can change the outcome of of of your of your of of whatever you desire just one word and that one word amen changed the outcome of that situation and all that all that's all Peter needed amen and out he went from the boat amen and everybody else may may be making fun of him all the other disciples what are you doing get out from there amen but he he he was he took faith of what he said he took faith of God's word he took faith of Jesus word amen one word he didn't read a whole chapter he didn't give them a whole thing amen just one word right amen and with that one word he walked on water amen what can you and I do amen with the whole word of God oh my and yet we have a hard time reading it right ah praise God with that one word amen Peter walked on water amen why because Peter amen took hold amen of that spur of the moment Faith amen Peter wasn't born again you got to remember that Peter did not have the Holy Ghost Peter did not all he all he was running on was exos of power amen remember in Matthew chapter 10 when Jesus gave them amen power to cast out Devils heal the SI the sick and all even to preach the gopel gopel that was all just exosa but it wasn't dunamus power yet with just that power he was able to walk with water how what can you and I do with dunamus power Amen in our souls with the power amen with the Holy Ghost in your soul what can you and I do amen tonight praise God your children amen will come to the Lord amen with that kind of Faith amen praise God your family amen your your body will be healed amen with that kind of Faith praise God Amen where nothing amen I don't care what the doctors say Amen you I respect what they said I I that's fine amen but something else struck me amen something else strikes me and says that that can't be so amen because faith is declaring something else hallelujah amen Revelation tells you otherwise right praise God verse 13 amen let's move a little quicker and that and that you will save alive my father so see here here's Rahab she's asking asking them you will save a lot my father and my mother and my brethren and my sister and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the man answered her our life for yours if you tell other people our business in other words and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then he then she let them down by cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall was upon the town wall that's what I was there speaking about in other in other versions of the of the Bible it says within the wall and she dwelt upon the wall amen so there we see rahab's faith in action again amen they told her you you tell other people about what we're doing amen you tell other people amen then you know our lives for yours you see but she said I promise I won't do anything and she immediately went into action continued her action continued her faith praise God and let them spies upon down the wall and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land so he's telling them she they're telling her that when when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whatsoever shall go out of the doors of the house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guilt L of and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if you utter this our business then we will we will we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear now watch verse 21 and she said amen according to your words so be it amen what does that sound like Amen to me it sounds like a a woman laid later on Amen hundreds of years ago which she was part of that lineage amen where Christ came from amen said the exact same thing thousands of years later when the angel when the angel Gabriel came unto Mary and said you're going to have a child and he said how can this be I don't not a man and he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you amen and and that that which is in you amen is of God Amen and all she was said okay be it unto me according to your word I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know what the Rahab was not going to be able to explain all the different how the walls were going to fall or how they were going to seize the the the the city she just went ahead and did what these spies told her to do and she said according unto your word so be it and she sent them away and they departed and watch what she does next and she bound the Scarlet line in the window but if you notice in verse 8 18 they told her the two spies told her when we come into the land Thou shalt bind the line of scarlet thread in the window in other words when they come and take over no she didn't wait till then she did it right there and then right and she bound the Scarlet line in the window in other words she tied it up right there and then amen she wasn't going to wait amen until next year amen to get right with God she wasn't going to wait until December 31st Amen to get down and take communion amen she wasn't going to wait amen until until this happens first and amen that might be too late then amen she got down to business right there and then amen young people amen don't wait until I will serve God next year you don't know if you'll be here next year right you don't you don't know amen we got 19 year olds 18 year olds amen 15 year olds dying left and right praise God we hear the news we that you don't know amen for you to be waiting amen you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow amen things have changed so much just in the last month amen amen praise God you don't know amen today is the day of salvation amen the Bible says not tomorrow not next year amen today amen well but I'm afraid that amen I'm GNA have to give up that nobody's telling you to give up anything a just come to the Lord yes would truly come to the Lord put tie that thing onto the window amen amen amen and and and then if you really mean business with God Amen then God will take those things out of you the holy spirit amen will take the music out of your life the movies out of your life the the the the Tik Tok out of your life the Instagram that you're so addicted to he'll take that out of your life amen just come to God don't think that I got to give it all up before I come to the Lord in 20125 amen you don't know if you have for next month to come to the Lord right that's right I don't either just come to the Lord now amen and and if you truly have that desire and you truly experience God that deep down settled faith in God's word amen that God what God did in rahab's life and and what God did in that woman at the Well's life amen if that really happens in your life it'll put it'll take care of everything else slowly but surely amen things will start falling off of your life that wow that was I don't really have a desire for that anymore I couldn't give up rap music I I couldn't give up country music I can't give up this this all this all this music amen I couldn't give all this up amen but now as I'm in the word more is I'm as I'm really paying attention to God's word as I'm feeding on the word and the word is washing me at the same time now I'm able to give these things up amen no Pastor told you to give it up your mom and dad never told you to give it up amen the word of God did it that's right that's when it's a true conversion then amen praise God Amen this woman didn't wait amen Rahab didn't wait until oh when the children of Israel come and and they take over the land I'll I'll go ahead and tie the the the the Scarlet thread to the window no she did it right there in then as soon as those spies left amen because she knew what she wanted she believed amen what she saw amen was true amen and that God the god of Israel was was the true God Of Heaven and Earth as she declared amen praise God Amen so see works is Faith expressed amen and so that's why it's so important and I say this to all of you but to our young people that's why it's so important for confessing with the mouth and believing amen Romans 10 8 says this it says but what sath it the word is n thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach which we preach that if verse n that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth so if you if you were if you were if this verse just meant for you to confess with your mind it would have said your mind amen it's not sufficient with your mind it says if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth and your mouth is not here your mouth is here if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that's the part that is eternal amen I believe I declare amen what did Rahab do it was a it was an outward confession of the faith that she received it was an expression outwardly amen other people need to see amen what you believe amen they need to hear amen I believe that God Amen the Son of God Jesus Christ died for me raised from the dead Amen on the third day and I believe that he can come back amen if I repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he'll promise me he'll give me the Holy Ghost amen if that's your confession amen praise God you'll receive that amen if you believe that in your heart that's right amen praise God but if it's just mental knowledge because you know the verse and you see when I was when I was young when I was in the bap Church they would always confess they would always read this verse and I knew it by heart and I knew it and and but I never did it there's one thing knowing the Bible and knowing quotes knowing them in your head and they're there that doesn't save you that just gives you some fake Assurance right don't don't misunderstand me because some people walk in this message with fake Assurance just because they know some quotes or some Bible versus amen you've got to know God for yourself amen you've got to confess with your mouth amen you've got to put that faith into action and when something Sparks in you amen that preacher up there preaching and amen snorting and slobbing all over the place so that I can repent amen and something grabs a hold of you you better take hold of that amen do it right there and then amen put that thread over the window right there and then don't wait till next year right next year might be too late you're not promised next year amen praise God how many of those people that passed away up that died we pray for those people that just died in that hurricane in Tennessee and Western North Carolina how many of those were young people I don't know I'm sure there was and they never thought that they would be washed down down a River floating their bodies floating and maybe some of them had the opportunity to get things right with God and that was their their opportunity and maybe they failed I don't know I'm not saying this to scare you I'm just saying this the Bible says today is the day of salvation not in 2025 not in 2026 amen today the Bible says is the day of salvation that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and thou shalt believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead what does the Bible say it says something so positive and so sure it says Thou shalt be saved that is is as simple as that you will be saved there's nothing nothing there's no question about it it's how it's how it's How ass sure Paul says this here for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth what and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation amen young people you better know that you have God not just because you come to this church or because you're you're you know you had a family member who was the pastor here or or or or or whatever man you've got to know that you know God Amen praise God you cannot go in under Mom and Dad's coattails and you cannot go under the pastor coattails or nothing amen you've got to know God for yourself amen like Rahab did that's right you've seen so much Rahab didn't see no but she just heard that's all she did you've seen a lot more you have no excuse Rahab has more excuse than you do praise God I'm sorry if I'll be a little hard but amen the Bible says compel them to come that's right it doesn't say oh come on come on the Lord can save you come on please please birdie please come to church no God I believe if we were doing that old fashion preaching like they were doing back then 30 40 50 years ago you probably see more people amen respecting the house of God Amen but people don't respect the house of God anymore because they they they they just come to they think that they've come to hear some intellectual thing some you know somebody just come Pat them in the back and not talk about their their house and how they should should be living and and stuff like that but when you get into people's uh into people's lives amen that's when they I'm not talking about you brother boy I'm just I'm I wasn't here I'll go up with the rhy brother rhy you know when you get into people's lives you know but the Bible says compel them to come right right praise God now I'm not talking about people's personal situations or anything like that you know don't get misunderstanding but when things get down to your level amen that's when it compels you otherwise it doesn't compel you right amen when it gets down to your level then it compels you when it doesn't you just brush it off on someone else oh that's brother so and so he he's the one who watches TV all the time and stuff like that and he's the one who's always on Tik Tock and and no but when it gets down to your level then it's different then but that's where we don't like it just preach me about the Seven Seals but they not touch my life tell me all about those things but not touch my life we need to have our lives touched am we need to have our lives touched amen praise God and so and so and just to finish up amen I'll just finish up with this I have a lot a little bit more but when Rahab did this saying Saints her faith acted upon this amen that's right her faith caused her to act the way she did to act strange what a strange thing to put and tie a thread over over a window nobody else was doing it in Jericho but the the the fivefold ministry of that day said amen they were inspired to tell her that amen who if it was God that led them there then it must have been God to tell her Amen to put that there right amen inspired to tell her that and she she just didn't waste any time she just did it amen can we take the word of God Amen of the preachers amen that preach by that way amen problem is we lack respect and we don't we don't respect what what the we don't respect amen the the authority of the ministry we don't respect it and that's why you don't get a blessing out of it amen praise God so she that's what she did and she and and because she did this amen the Bible says that her family Joshua herself Joshua himself the Holy Ghost remember he's the he's the type of the Holy Spirit Jesus himself Amen in in in chapter three I believe it is he made sure to oversee that she came she was she was she was saved amen that's right he said he stopped in the middle of the battle after the walls fell down amen he stopped in the middle of the chaos and he said said to the two spies you go make sure that Rahab is okay and in the middle of all the chaos and probably people running around and and and and and dirt flying all over the place and everything and maybe fire and all kinds of thing people dying animals dying in the middle of all that chaos Joshua stops and says make sure that Rahab is okay amen oh God in the middle of the chaos amen of of the of what your problem is or no matter what's going on in your life amen if you've got faith in this word amen God is going to make sure amen that he saves and answers your request amen praise God you did your part I'm going to do mine amen praise God God makes sure that he did that for for Rahab praise the Lorden why because she had faith in something that she just heard amen everybody else was closing the Bible says that everybody else closed the doors of the walls the amen they would have been better to just let the Israelites come in come on in you are the people of God we just like nin amen and they accepted the the message and they believed they would have been better off just allowing the people of God to come in and probably God would have spared them right but not but they didn't do what Rahab did Rahab these are these are our enemies but yet I'm going to let them in my house I have no other choice amen this is the the only way I have to to be saved and my family to be saved amen something ridiculous that she did but it caused her to be saved amen and sometimes you might have to do something ridiculous amen boohoo and cry amen at the altar or or or or pray to God all night long and stay in his word amen but that ridiculous will bring a life in your in your life amen we bring something real praise the Lord amen praise praise God Amen so and so going back to Hebrews 11:30 says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received despies with peace can you imagine that her house being right there within the walls and all the walls crumble but her house stays right that's got to be God right amen that was God God respected her faith amen because her faith seized the moment amen likewise J James likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works you see she it put her into action and that's what Justified her when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way amen praise the Lord Jesus and so brother B says this about uh we'll be finishing up here in just a moment he had he had a Time amen remember when when remember the story when brother brandham the Lord told Brother brandom as he was praying he went into the closet and he was inspired so much by the story of Joseph and Joseph and he went into the closet and he said Lord I just thank you for a man like Joseph Joseph in the Bible uh you know in in the Old Testament he said I thank you for a man like Joseph you know and I thank you for his life that even though he was he suffered and was accused wrongly and and all this he couldn't help to have visions and to have dreams and these things but I thank you for a man like that that stood firm amen and as brother Brandon was praying you can go back and read it and the message Faith Works as Faith Express he says his brother Brandon was praying and something told him the Lord told him he said he said you're going to have a son named Joseph that's right and so he went all across the country telling the people that he was going to have a son named Joseph amen and and for years amen he was saying he didn't know when it was coming or nothing and so here are some of the things that brother Brandon went through in order to get to that point amen right when the Lord showed brother Brandon that his son Joseph was coming brother Brandon was made fun of because Sarah was born in between that time frame Sarah his his his his his middle daughter and so they started making fun of brother Brandon and he said what you meant was Josephine was was Josephine that was coming not Joseph and so he had to receive that ridicule doctors said to Sister ma that she couldn't have any more babies after after Sarah was born right he was called a false prophet because Sarah was born but Joseph was not there yet yet he was still proclaiming and and and and claiming that God Amen God had showed him that he was going to have a son named Joseph amen he was called a false prophet false rumors were spread around the Nation about him and his wife he talks about it in this message you go back and read it right and during her pregnancy with Joseph sister ma was wasn't guaranteed to live she almost died right and so brother brandham says this in the message and she said talking about meting and she said Bill do you think I'm going to die and I said I don't know but the baby is going to be born anyhow right you see that faith that that that's the faith that Rahab had amen I don't know what's going to happen but I'm going to go ahead and just tie that Scarlet that Scarlet that token amen down down that window I don't know but the baby is going to be born anyhow you're going to have Joseph right she said is this Him Sister ma asking him I said I don't know honey I can't say but God said he's going to have Joseph and we're going to have Joseph you see that positive confession amen whatever it is in your life amen just keep claiming it Joseph wasn't there amen your healing may not be there amen the salvation of your children may not be there just keep claiming it amen I don't care what anything says he says we're going to have Joseph for the same God that's told me all these Revelations told me that he never failed on others and he won't fail on that am amen and we know Joseph came on the scene that's right praise God and it was because brother brandham stood firmer amen everybody ridiculing him everybody making fun of him his wife almost dying doctors telling him your wife can't have any more children let let me tie her tubes and he said you better not he said you you better not and and all this coming against him amen he he says he said Joseph welcome that's what he says in the message amen so can you be like job Saints amen and job and with this I'm gonna have the musicians come up job says in job 19 he says for I know what have we been talking about faith that seizes the moment faith that seizes the moment amen knows what did Brother Bram said I know that God is here speak whatever you want to Sister Hattie and God will give it to you amen I know what did what did Rahab say I know we know that the God Amen your God is the god in heaven and the God in Earth amen amen what did the woman at the well say I know we know that when Messiah come he'll tell us this thing these things amen for I know my redeemer liveth job there in that in his boils and let's enter our feet in his boils and in his condition amen for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth he in the middle of all that he confesses this in the middle of his sickness he confesses that I know amen God must have Dro something down in his heart to let him know that I know my redeemer lives even though I'm in this condition amen I know that he re that he lives therefore I can live amen and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh not not after I die not after I not in heaven he said in my flesh I shall see God Amen that's right it must have been a revelation to job what is faith faith is a revelation right amen and though after my skin worms destroy the body yet my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself not that my wife will see it or that you know someone else will see it no I will shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold amen and not another though my Reigns be consumed with me praise God Amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so I wonder Saints amen if you if you can declare amen your faith like job did and no matter what condition you're in amen no matter what's happening in your life amen can you be bold like job amen at the point of death at the point of dying Amen to say I know that what I've received amen is capable Amen to take me on Amen that the faith that he has given me even if it's like the little grain of mustard seed amen it can move a mountain praise God my faith may not be strong my faith may be may be weak but God can use that same Faith amen God can use your weak Faith amen just have faith the little faith that you do have amen and when something comes amen and you know that it's yours amen seese the moment and take hold of it right there and then praise the Lord Jesus amen praise God Amen let's play that song Sisters let through that song be flat amen amen that was the song I told you
