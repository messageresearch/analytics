[10:51] and N uh very simple scripture but you I
[10:55] know you all are familiar with it uh
[10:58] we're say for by grace are you saved
[11:01] through faith and that not of yourselves
[11:05] it is the gift of God not of Works lest
[11:09] any man should boast amen may God bless
[11:12] the reading of his word thank you very
[11:13] much you all may be

[11:27] count it as a great privilege I thank
[11:30] the Lord for his grace upon my life that
[11:32] he made it possible that I could come
[11:35] and visit your Saints and stand before
[11:37] you share the word of God what God has
[11:39] laid on my heart I would like to thank
[11:41] uh uh Pastor Samuel Dale and the family
[11:44] brother Wade and each one of you for
[11:48] giving me this opportunity that I could
[11:50] come and share the word of God I would
[11:52] like to thank each one of you and uh if
[11:55] you want a title uh for today this
[11:59] morning uh on the basis of the
[12:01] scriptures what we have read and I would
[12:03] title like this
[12:05] Undisputed value of Faith amen now the
[12:09] faith we are talking about it is the
[12:11] faith of
[12:13] God we are talking about the faith which
[12:16] God has given us by his grace and the
[12:20] Bible tells us that uh the faith which
[12:22] is given to us God has given us by
[12:24] measure and the
[12:27] proportion uh so we each one have faith
[12:30] in our lives and uh we cannot deny that
[12:34] we don't have faith because the Bible
[12:37] says we have received Faith from God and
[12:40] he has given us by measure and by
[12:42] proportion right amen amen but what we
[12:44] have to do is we need to exercise our
[12:47] faith and uh uh asking God for his help
[12:52] so that our faith will be increased
[12:54] Glory like our Prophet taught us that we
[12:57] could pray for every thing or anything
[13:00] that's in the world but he said the
[13:02] greatest prayer you can pray to to uh
[13:06] plead him Lord increased my faith right
[13:10] you know and and uh faith has got a
[13:13] tremendous value I would like to uh just
[13:16] read something for you if you don't mind
[13:19] and uh you know uh someone uh would say
[13:23] what good would it uh do to have faith
[13:28] and and the prophet of God God makes a
[13:30] statement he said faith can sign my
[13:32] pardon sure there's value in faith glory
[13:36] and that's where I got my thought
[13:39] Undisputed value of Faith now you can
[13:43] dispute about anything that's in the
[13:45] world you can dispute about the
[13:48] structure of the building the value of
[13:50] the building you can dispute uh on the
[13:54] measurements of the building or the area
[13:56] of the building you know you can you can
[13:59] about anything you want to you know you
[14:01] can have a dispute about a property a
[14:04] piece of ground and you can you can
[14:06] dispute uh whatever opinion you got and
[14:10] uh you you can take anything that's in
[14:12] the world and and you can dispute it you
[14:15] can you can argue with it you can you
[14:18] can give your opinion you can you can
[14:20] give your negatives you can give your
[14:22] positives you can give your best of your
[14:24] opinions you can give the worst opinions
[14:27] you know you can dispute with any
[14:29] anything that's in the world but brother
[14:31] sister we are talking about something
[14:33] that cannot be disputed it is an
[14:37] Undisputed value that faith has God and
[14:41] brother sister this Faith you know uh
[14:43] the as the prophet of God has taught us
[14:45] that it can sign our pardon and not only
[14:48] the prophet of God but before the
[14:50] prophet of God came into the scene the
[14:53] Bible is already being written by the
[14:55] inspiration of the Holy Ghost amen and
[14:58] if you if you can and say Amen to the
[15:00] word of God that will really bless your
[15:02] heart brother sister you know this word
[15:04] of God is given by inspiration for our
[15:07] betterment for our blessings for our you
[15:11] know edifying uh edification of our
[15:14] spiritual life and and and Paul speaks
[15:17] to the to the church in Ephesians here
[15:20] and he speaks to the people who are
[15:22] saved he's talking to Christians he's
[15:25] not talking here to the unbelievers he
[15:29] talking to the people who have already
[15:30] known Christ and they knew the power of
[15:33] the Deliverance they knew the power of
[15:35] the Holy Ghost they knew what God has
[15:38] done in their lives they have
[15:40] experienced they have tasted God in
[15:43] their lives what God has done uh who is
[15:46] rich in Mercy and think about this
[15:49] brother sister and the Bible you know
[15:51] the the very first words it says he said
[15:53] and you have quaken who were dead in
[15:56] trespasses and sin sir you know when we
[15:59] when we think about our natural birth
[16:02] when we look about our natural uh
[16:04] Instinct in in life you know we are no
[16:07] good there is nothing good there is no
[16:10] righteousness in us there is no goodness
[16:13] in us there is there is there was
[16:15] nothing that God could see and and you
[16:18] know you know uh feel good about us
[16:22] because the Bible says we were brought
[16:24] and brought up and we were shaved in sin
[16:27] and we were shaved in
[16:29] and we came into this world speaking
[16:32] lives but thank God before the world was
[16:37] ever founded or put foundation To The
[16:39] World God knew us and that makes him a
[16:43] infinite God that makes him almighty God
[16:46] that makes him a powerful God that makes
[16:49] him as a alls sufficient God are you
[16:52] with me brothers and sisters that makes
[16:54] him a wonderful savior but you know when
[16:57] we come into this world
[16:59] we come with the natural desire of our
[17:02] of our father and mother we were born in
[17:05] sin we were shaped in an equity but he
[17:08] knew
[17:09] us because he chosen us he knew us
[17:12] before the foundation of the world I'm
[17:15] so grateful and thankful to God and
[17:18] that's the reason we have come to our
[17:20] place that's the reason we have come to
[17:22] our position where we can say yes Lord I
[17:26] believe in you I trust in you because
[17:29] the faith he has given to me and that
[17:32] faith has helped me to believe that
[17:34] there is only one
[17:37] God there is no
[17:39] other now you know in America or the
[17:43] Western world has has only known about a
[17:46] God and and and and and the and the God
[17:49] name is is Lord Jesus Christ now you you
[17:53] have Catholics in this country you got
[17:56] all kinds of uh Christian uh different
[17:59] Christian churches in America in England
[18:02] in the Western and the European world
[18:04] but I come from a country which has got
[18:07] 33 Millions gods and
[18:10] goddess can you imagine brother sister
[18:13] you have only about one God but I heard
[18:15] about God who are 33 Millions gods and
[18:19] goddesses you can point out that is
[18:21] their
[18:23] God right right now you know this is on
[18:26] the internet this service is on the
[18:28] internet right and and you know I've got
[18:31] enough sense what I'm talking about
[18:33] today because there may be some people
[18:35] in India you know listening to this
[18:37] message what I'm saying but you know
[18:40] this is the very truth that I come from
[18:43] a country which has got 33 Millions gods
[18:46] and goddesses but think about the faith
[18:49] I'm talking about today think about the
[18:51] grace that I have received in my heart
[18:53] today think about the mercies of the
[18:56] Living God that God has opened eyes and
[18:59] my understanding to see that there's
[19:02] only one God only one true Living
[19:06] God and I was dead in sin and in
[19:10] trespasses but thank God when I was dead
[19:13] when I was dirty when I was you know
[19:17] there was nothing good in me that God
[19:19] could look look upon but yet he loved me
[19:23] yet he he showed me his love yet he
[19:27] showed me his grace he showed me his
[19:30] mercy and he quickened me amen
[19:33] hallelujah he quickened me to live he
[19:36] quickened me to eternal life he
[19:39] quickened me to see the the depth of
[19:42] God's love for my
[19:45] life hallelujah amen it says when in
[19:48] time pass he walked according to the
[19:50] course of this world according to the
[19:53] prince of the power of the air the
[19:55] spirit that now worketh in the children
[19:57] of disobedience
[19:59] among whom also we all had our
[20:01] conversation in times past in the lusts
[20:04] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[20:06] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[20:09] Nature the children of R even as others
[20:13] but God who is rich in Mercy for his
[20:17] great love
[20:19] right we cannot measure his love right
[20:23] we we cannot know the depth of his
[20:26] love if I know the depth of the love of
[20:29] God I know only in the portion in the in
[20:32] the in the uh little portion of it but
[20:35] you know I have never known what is the
[20:38] depth but you know thank God that he has
[20:40] opened our eyes to see his great love
[20:44] Glory which we cannot measure which we
[20:47] which our minds cannot fathom Hallelujah
[20:51] where with he loved us oh what a love
[20:53] that is brother and sister if you are
[20:55] loving our Lord Jesus Christ tonight
[20:58] it's nothing great in us we love him
[21:01] because he loved us hallelujah because
[21:05] he first loved us we are loving him
[21:07] today sometimes we think that we are
[21:09] doing a favor to God by coming to church
[21:13] sometimes we think we doing favor to God
[21:15] when we walk according to his word of
[21:17] God you know sometimes we think we do
[21:19] favor to God when we do good things you
[21:22] know we we think we are doing a favor to
[21:24] God when we put our offering but brother
[21:26] sister when you use the electric you
[21:29] have to pay the bill when you use the
[21:32] use the water you have to pay the water
[21:34] bill and you using his
[21:40] oxygen just think about it if the if the
[21:43] payment is not paid and if they cut out
[21:47] your gas or your electricity you have no
[21:50] stuff to cook you may say Brother Sam we
[21:53] have got wood to cook
[21:56] yeah well if the wood gets so then
[22:00] what right that's
[22:04] right you know being traveling in
[22:06] different places he said save the forest
[22:08] save the forest that shows the forest is
[22:12] you know people are cutting lot of
[22:15] wood you know and and and and wildfires
[22:19] you know and and they have a sign that
[22:21] say you can you can stop wildf fires so
[22:24] there are a lot of things happening
[22:26] brother sister but just think about it
[22:28] you know we think that we are doing a
[22:29] favor to God by coming to the church but
[22:32] remember we are just doing it because we
[22:35] love
[22:36] him it's it's not a compulsion no
[22:40] nothing is compulsory now God is a
[22:43] gentleman the Bible says right he
[22:45] doesn't pushes anybody exactly he puts
[22:47] you know in front of you life and death
[22:50] you choose life you have chosen the
[22:53] right if you choose that it's up to
[22:56] you there are two roads one is the toll
[23:00] has been paid but if you don't want to
[23:02] take that road which is the the toll has
[23:04] been paid then you have to keep on
[23:06] paying from your pocket because you
[23:09] chose the road right exactly you know so
[23:12] so we need to be careful in what we're
[23:14] doing what we're saying but brother
[23:16] sister we are talking about faith and
[23:18] you know that has got a great value
[23:21] right a tremendous value for the faith
[23:24] right amen just I want you to to to uh
[23:27] you know follow my thought little bit
[23:30] and and and the Bible I want to go a
[23:32] little further it says but God who is
[23:34] rich in Mercy for his great love where
[23:37] with he loved us even when we were dead
[23:40] in sins had quaken us together with
[23:43] Christ by Grace he are saved only by the
[23:47] grace of God we are saved I am saved you
[23:51] are saved it's the same Grace and
[23:54] brother sister when that cap Stone comes
[23:57] down amen when that headstone comes down
[24:00] it will be only Grace and nothing else
[24:04] Hallelujah the Bible says it will be
[24:06] only Grace if you are getting ready

[37:11] it helps us to walk in the deepest
[37:13] valley right the darkest Valley it helps
[37:18] us to have strength yes sir yeah it
[37:21] helps us to Have Courage yeah I would
[37:24] like you to just you know follow a
[37:26] little bit with me the book of Hebrews
[37:30] 10: 22 and 23 says let us draw near with
[37:35] a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith
[37:39] right what gives us Assurance the gospel
[37:42] amen the word of Goden this gives us a
[37:45] full assurance and the and and the
[37:48] Apostle Paul says let us draw near with
[37:50] the True Heart in full Assurance of
[37:53] Faith having our heart sprinkled from an
[37:55] evil conscience and our bodies washed
[37:58] with the pure water amen then he says
[38:01] let us hold fast the preparation of our
[38:04] faith right yeah let us hold fast to
[38:07] what we have
[38:09] confessed profession is confession of
[38:12] our faith without wavering right amen
[38:15] the Bible is asking us not to wav right
[38:19] now there are two reasons we should not
[38:21] waver right the Book of James chap
[38:24] 1 verse 6 and 7
[38:30] it
[38:31] says ver six but let him ask in faith
[38:35] right not nothing wavering exactly for
[38:38] he that Werth is like a wave of the sea
[38:42] driven by the wind and TOS right right y
[38:46] the Bible is asking us not to we right
[38:49] right he wants us to be grounded and
[38:52] settled in faith amen right and we need
[38:56] to continue there on right it's not one
[39:00] day one week it's every moment of our
[39:03] life we need to continue in faith no
[39:05] matter what situation comes no matter
[39:07] what sickness we have no matter what the
[39:09] doctors are saying no matter what the
[39:12] people are saying no matter what the
[39:13] other churches are saying we need to
[39:15] just keep on continuing and grounded and
[39:19] without wa we need to be settled in
[39:21] faith he says he says but let him ask in
[39:24] faith nothing waving for he that is like
[39:28] a way of the sea driven with the wind
[39:30] and TS power let not that man think that
[39:34] he shall receive anything of the Lord
[39:36] right you cannot even
[39:39] imagine if your faith is wavering come
[39:42] on if your faith is shaken
[39:47] yeah whether God can do this do that
[39:50] right is it possible the doctors has
[39:53] said you will die yeah you know there is
[39:56] no hope
[39:57] the Medical Science has done its best
[40:00] and there is no hope but I am a
[40:02] Christian I am a believer can do
[40:04] anything to me yes he already spoken in
[40:08] his word by his tribes you are healed
[40:11] now that's his word if he says by his
[40:14] Tripes you are healed you are
[40:17] healed if you say I'm not healed I have
[40:19] the problem it's because you're lacking
[40:21] fath right
[40:23] exactly amen right amen come on think
[40:27] about it my brothers my sisters amen
[40:29] that's the first thing if you were you
[40:32] will be driven with the wind and passed
[40:34] up and down right exactly we cannot be
[40:37] in that position and think that God will
[40:39] answer our prayer now the second reason
[40:43] second reason that we should not waver
[40:45] in our faith Hebrews 11:39 and these all
[40:50] having obtained a good report through
[40:52] faith received not the promise God
[40:55] having provided some better things for
[40:58] us that they without us should not be
[41:01] made perfect can you see the second
[41:03] reason we have got something better than
[41:05] all those people that's right yes
[41:09] sir right yes sir on and I could say we
[41:13] got the best
[41:14] things that the whole history of
[41:17] mankind we got the best thing what they

[41:49] it now the apostles the children
[41:52] Disciples of Jesus Christ they had a
[41:54] name he said these are the on who turned
[41:55] the world upside down right exactly and

[52:54] yeah what you have to do exercise your
[52:58] faith
[52:58] amen the prophet of God in the message
[53:02] faith in action speaking about Noah and
[53:04] his day and its message yeah the prophet
[53:08] G said that he built Ark on the word of
[53:11] God right for the saving of his family
[53:14] he kept on
[53:16] building he had many
[53:18] critics oh yeah lot of critics that's
[53:22] right his SS are much
[53:25] more you know higher level than what we
[53:27] got
[53:29] right you talk about the pyramids being
[53:32] built right the prophet of God said
[53:35] there is no machine that can take that
[53:37] Big Stone today and place it in such a
[53:39] way that has been already placed right
[53:42] he said there's no machine in this
[53:43] present world right I was just talking
[53:46] about the the the the technology the
[53:48] other day you think about the cars you
[53:52] know 50 years back their body was built
[53:55] by 18 or 20 mm gate the body was Heavy
[53:59] tough rather you punch it it will break
[54:02] your bones in your in
[54:04] your that was Heavy strong but you know
[54:07] the science begin to grow the technology
[54:10] begin to grow the more technology it was
[54:13] growing the more better they were coming
[54:15] with sign the more lighter they made
[54:18] today you can take your hand and punch
[54:20] your car it will have a big
[54:24] right dance thank you
[54:27] it will have a big dent why because
[54:30] they're thinking about the marriage they
[54:33] wanted to make the body light and the
[54:35] engine powerful and that's why people
[54:37] are killed so easily right exactly
[54:41] because the car is not built stronger
[54:43] right am that's how about our technology
[54:46] right now what about no's technology
[54:49] right yeah what was the time you know
[54:52] when when they built
[54:53] pyramids right what kind of Technology
[54:56] he said even the razor could not pass
[54:58] through between the stones what kind of
[55:01] Technology it was right right think
[55:03] about it my brothers myself exactly
[55:05] right and he says in spite of all those
[55:08] critics against him he said he just went
[55:12] on believed it was God's word and God is
[55:16] going to perform what he has spoken
[55:19] right amen now Noah kept on holding to
[55:23] that right and then Prophet goes further
[55:25] and he said but faith doesn't look at
[55:27] what a circumstances is Faith doesn't
[55:31] look what circumstances is Right Faith
[55:34] looks to what God says right hallelujah
[55:37] amen if we got faith in us if we say we
[55:40] are believers then we must have faith in
[55:42] us or else without faith we cannot be a
[55:45] believer we can be a make believer we
[55:47] can be unbeliever but if you want to be
[55:49] a believer we need to have faith if we
[55:52] got faith then Faith doesn't look at the
[55:55] circumstance
[55:57] Faith only looks what God says if God
[56:00] says you are healed you are healed now
[56:03] Faith is looking at that amen that's
[56:05] right amen amen Faith doesn't try to
[56:08] reason Faith just takes it at its face
[56:12] value
[56:13] right now that's faith it will take God
[56:17] God's word in his face value Faith knows
[56:20] what is the power in the word of God but
[56:23] when you take that word and put in a
[56:25] human thinking or imagination
[56:29] right there all the problems comes amen
[56:33] yeah is this possible is this amen okay
[56:39] but the faith takes it at its face value

[1:03:53] only two faculties that govern a human
[1:03:55] being one of them is Faith which brings
[1:03:58] result Faith brings results right and
[1:04:01] fear has got no value in it at all right
[1:04:04] faith is of god fear is of the devil
[1:04:06] right fear makes you weary and
[1:04:08] wonder but it is of 0% value right
[1:04:12] exactly Hallelujah absolutely amen can
[1:04:14] you say amen amen exactly amen this says
[1:04:17] unbelief can do nothing for you but then
[1:04:21] right
[1:04:23] right that's all it can do to destroy
[1:04:26] you and faith is the only thing that can
[1:04:28] help you right unbelief there's no value
[1:04:32] in unbelief at all unbelief accompanies
[1:04:35] fear when you go through reasoning and
[1:04:37] wondering then you begin to fear amen it
[1:04:41] says so fear is no good at all no value
[1:04:44] in it let's discard the thing all
[1:04:46] together let's have faith and believe
[1:04:48] God so it's by faith we know God not by
[1:04:51] knowledge amen hallelujah amen that's
[1:04:55] what we today right no fear no worries
[1:05:00] right many people in this day they
[1:05:03] looking at the things of the world oh
[1:05:06] the world is getting better the world is
[1:05:07] getting worse the yeah we're not
[1:05:09] expecting anything
[1:05:13] good but the problem is why our eyes are
[1:05:16] focusing on the bad things on why can't
[1:05:20] we focus on the things of
[1:05:23] God why don't our eyes see the of God
[1:05:27] the position God has placed the things
[1:05:29] God has given to us you know the
[1:05:31] blessings God has given to us the faith
[1:05:33] he has given to us brother you know we
[1:05:36] need to face uh Place love in our hearts
[1:05:39] right amen and love is God Amen that's
[1:05:42] why we need the Holy Ghost today right
[1:05:44] without the Holy Ghost we cannot have
[1:05:46] love amen we cannot have faith because
[1:05:49] love produces Faith that's what he says
[1:05:52] here only love produces faith
[1:05:58] God hats a cover
[1:06:01] yep love casts out all fear right amen

[1:06:06] any fear right fear don't have one bit
[1:06:09] of value about it no and you and we talk
