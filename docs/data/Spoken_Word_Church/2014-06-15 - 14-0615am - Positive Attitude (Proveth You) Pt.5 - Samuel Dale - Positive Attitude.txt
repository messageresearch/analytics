deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaks of insanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood that our gardeners may be full according to all manners of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets that there is whom god is the lord open the the eyes of my heart i want to see you yes i want to see shining in the light of your glory you love him shining in the light of your glory oh amen and amen and amen you want to see him just look around you'll find him amen good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to deuteronomy 13. in exodus 20 deuteronomy 13 exodus 20. slew of announcements and things but glad to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have rick with us there good to see him good to see all of you in the things so we say to you happy father's day to all let's give all the fathers a good hand on happy father's day we had a wonderful time with the brothers and all of the and the kids and things up at father's day camp and i think it was 14 of us or something like that it was down this year because a lot couldn't come but we had a good time and we found out a lot of things we didn't know so sister esther you don't let tony fool you anymore where she at she's back there okay don't let him fool you anymore he can cook he came up there saying he didn't even know how to make his own bed and he left cooking eggs and cooking um hush puppies and doing a good job we fired boyd he has to go over to the to the cleaning camp or something you know and take over on that side because it was it was a great time we really did and while we're at it we'll go ahead i got a lot of things and then we'll start now we're going to have a meeting here the fourth of july weekend all right that will be the first saturday in july which will be our regular bible study doing all right so we're going to have saturday night and sunday all right i want to give you an opportunity and then we're not going to vote we're just going to leave it as a you can let me know but what we're going to do we're going to have a fish fry that weekend all right so i'm going to give you two options all right you think it over comment back on it option one saturday afternoon meet about two three o'clock two o'clock you know here at the church down the stairs we'll meet and we will be cooking the fish and we will have hot dogs and things you know extra in case you don't like fish but we'll do that on saturday afternoon and then have bible study at six o'clock all right so that way you can make your plans and any of you from away that want to stay we will make sure you have a place to stay with somebody you know for the saturday night all right that's the option one we're going to have saturday services and we're going to have sunday services all right so it's not you're not thinking about that the other way is we can have the saturday night service of the bible study of those who would like to come to the bible study and we will like we say always we will might try to make a way for you to spend the night or do something saturday night you don't have to go back home all right and then we will have sunday morning service and have a fish fry and about starting quick as we get through eating maybe about 1 30 two o'clock sunday afternoon having no evening service all right so you're gonna have to let me know kind of the way you want so you got it we're going to how the service is saturday we're going to how the service is sunday so it's not a doing that way but it'll be a decision of whether or not you want to do on saturday and how the fish fry or how the fish fry on sunday all right because if you do on sunday the only problem we have is we finish and then there's going to have to be a delay in the time because we got to cook the fish which is going to take an hour or so to getting everything to going okay let me know about which way you want to go all right and that'll that we'll determine on that and doing in that okay let's see we got that now the way uh i started to have friday saturday and sunday because july the 4th is actually on friday but we will just have it the saturday bible study and the doings you know but we'll do that okay remember brother dean is very sick this morning remember him and remember brother gary uh sister rebecca telling us that he was had a lot of diarrhea and he's also passing some blood so remember that and pray that the lord would would be with him take care of that all right the fellowship meeting will be at brother pageants on the third saturday in july 3 30. all right let next weekend we will have two visiting preachers and sister monica if i get this wrong you forgive me but sister monaco's brother william borla von bolivan is that close did i get it close sister monica where are you at okay all right anyhow sister monica's brother he will be with us preaching the morning service and then brother tom ernest will be preaching the afternoon service okay i think that's all of the announcements did i miss any if i did i'll catch back up in a little bit okay remember we're still on the positive attitude so deuteronomy 13 and exodus 20 let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you for all things and we pray that you would come among us today in a mighty way and do as you've always said that you would send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction remember these that are sick remember the different ones lord among us and just have your way with each and every one of us that we may all lord be what you want us to be forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and lord just blessing god each and every one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you in jesus name all right deuteronomy 13. we were on this last week and uh but you know i thought well we need to continue on this part i'll get more to that in a little bit but we want to read from deuteronomy 13. now remember in like in deuteronomy 18 you're covering that if a prophet come and the word always comes to the prophet you know and the things come to pass you're supposed to hear that prophet right but this is the scripture that a lot of people never hardly relate to is deuteronomy 13 1 through 3. all right if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder now watch and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them see that's if that's what he says to you let's go after this let's go after a two soul a seventh under virtue forgive me okay no after false doctrines all right that shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for you the lord your god proveth you to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your souls so now he's going to do that now we read in exodus uh 20 verse 20 verse 20 of what you're getting there verse 19 this is moses and you know it when they come out and got egypt i mean the people out of egypt and are out at the in the whole mountains on fire and they said until moses speaks thou with us verse 19 and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for god has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now i want to the brothers pull up something and i hope that it doesn't bother the sister that gave me the testimonies okay all right uh and on the thing you'll see some writings because i actually saw the sister standing up last sunday during the worship service from back there and i thought you know that's odd because i don't mean wrong but i just mean that a lot of times you don't see people just one person here standing up worse than god but she was standing up and i think sister gail was standing there with her last sunday but i want you to read the testimony that her sister gave and i wanted i wrote up the top of it that remember that when wade was preaching the other night that brother aldous shot his arm up and and it just started moving so i'm saying god is with us but look at the testimony now if you have trouble reading it you know we can make some copies she said brother dale there's here's a praise report last sunday june the 8th during the morning worship service and i wrote there i saw her stand up see i saw it i felt the presence of the holy spirit very strong i couldn't help myself i just stood up and praised the lord praised the lord in that instant he healed my right knee completely also through my body through through my whole body i felt a power surge and a renewed feeling remains i had been taking three to nine ibuprofens every day for over a year just to keep going and to walk since last sunday i haven't felt any pain and definitely i have not take not needed any medication or pain pills praise to our lord and savior jesus christ sister charlotte marlowe i believe that don't you all right now what did brother brown say for god to touch one person so we got two accounts there he said that should encourage everybody to believe all right encourage you to believe and say well he can do it for one person he can do it for me and should be able to follow that line all right and if you want a copy of that but it will be on the internet part we can uh let him run it off it's all right with his sister to give the testimony all right now remember what we've been talking on the positive attitude and that's what i said about doings we talk about healing we talk about things happening and i believe that god as the prophet said wants to heal us more than we want to be healed you know when i first heard that i thought okay that don't sound like us old human beings that don't sound like you know i want to be healed i don't want to be sick and you say something to people and say what do you mean you think i want to be sick and i've said it and i still believe it and i'll keep on saying it i believe there's a lot of people in the world that i'd rather be sick than well i won't back off from that one step because i believe it you know why because you can never get them to a point to believe that they're healed you can't get them to a point to believe it and they ain't got nothing to talk about i got one in here i'm going to read it a little while when i get down to it what brother branham was saying he preached the message he went right down into discernment and irish people was doing exactly what he said he said they'd do it how many times have i told you we hear faith preach we talk about the word and then outside i got a doctor's point did we we are not worried about doctors we believe in doctors we go to doctors we thank god for doctors they are god's sent your prophet went to the doctor when grass valve is grass valley california when he was preaching jehovah jairus series he's having to go just about every day to the doctor and the sick being healed maybe dead raised and things we believe in doctors but we don't put the doctor first we put god first and we believe it and we thank god then for every help and aid that we can get in that line but see you can say you know it's hard to get people to just say i am healed what did it say well i don't want to lie about it and i ain't feeling better right i don't want to lie you liar anyway you're born a liar don't worry about being one you're born one when you say if you're sick and god has not healed you you're a liar because he's already done it right right but yet we were so super religious we don't want to lie if i said i was healed and me still hurting i'd be a liar okay so you're a liar but you don't understand my case i guess god's got different cases but brother brown said the same for everybody but anyhow do you understand what i'm getting at the prophet said the biggest portion of our faith is what mental faith all right he said hold on to your mental faith and confess it you remember when he was talking about how that that he started confessing he's healed and he was vomiting like crazy he was he said he'd hold his hand over his mouth and vomiting through his hand and saying i'm healed you remember what he told the blind man go say you're healed you know what he confessed it till god come on this thing and he healed him well well as he wounds he will his brother fourny said we're just so pitiful i would to god we would get out of being babies i'll read the first one we'll get to in a minute we've really been talking about i believe it's one where he talks about just being jellyfish christian jellyfish it ought to be the time that we get down and at least say what the word says they said something to brother brown said you told him people was healed he said the bible says they're healed right but think about it he said the right mental attitude toward any promise of god will bring that promise to pass now what's the right man latitude well i'm not gonna say i'm here cause i'm not you when i'm healed i'll get up until i'm healed don't worry about it you'll never say it because you must first you'll never be saved that way remember your first what confess with your mouth believe in your heart right the confession goes with it you know all right but then remember what we got down to into life's message you know that god loves to test our faith you remember that god loves to test our faith well what kind of a god have you got you sound like you've got a god that allows sickness as well we'll read it if he don't allow it it don't come but we're going to get it in the right place you know god loves to test your this was what i was trying to get across last weekend he loves to test you mental faith right that's right you know mental faith just just saying by strike some heal or believing it just start now he loves to test that why because he wants to know whether or not you're going to believe his word that's right right well i just can't understand that's what it means that's why people are not healed they can't even stand the mental test and i know my language forgive me out there when i say mental i mean m-e-n-t-a-l i know a lot of people say i'm hard to understand well all right get your dicks in here and look it up you know you'll find the word all right he loves to test your mental faith god loves to put you to a test what did he say about job devil comes up talking to god and he said have you considered my servant job you know what god's proud of him you know what he's proud to put him to a test you know what he lost what seven kids and even his wife turned against him boys all over him you ever had one you ever had a rising as we call them today you don't want them all over you you don't want one a little pimple on your face that you pop that comes out you know that ain't horizon verizon has got a core that goes down deep i had two on my arm one time about probably between an inch and a half to two inches apart and when i pulled that core out there was a tunnel away between both of them i'm talking about a core big enough to be bigger than a pencil i mean bigger than a a big large match stem job had them all over him and god says go at him satan but you can't take his life and then we get all upset because of some little bad cold we got we'll get to the point in a minute but he loves to test just our faith of what we say he loves to really loves to test us then after we get the faith he loves to test us after we really get the revelation you know after he's revealed to us what's going to be just think about it i wish that you would listen or read the message called perfect faith i wish you would get that one read it or listen to it all right god loves to try us and we'll allow things to come among us to trust that's right we'll get to it in a minute where nothing can't happen to you that unless god permits it enjoy he talks about 225 the locust caterpillar he said my great army he even called you that i've allowed to come among you he says thou sent now we know he didn't make it come and we know that that that kangaroo bomb we're looking caterpillar is not god's army of great good things but it's what he permits he allows it to come among you all right in first peter 4 and 12. he said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you what as though some strange thing happened to you read it again beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you don't feel stress make it strong you know well i'm going to only want to stay with you i'm the only one's ever had this case watch and say as though some strange thing happened to us things are not strange in god i thought we believed it was for a reason nothing can happen to you unless god allows it to come upon you now come on forgive me for being just blunt the way that i talk but you know we blame the devil for everything like that lady said he is a good devil but what if the problem you're in is a test or a trial and when we get through here i hope you realize that there cannot be a problem come upon you that god does not allow but ron said the devil is the best thing you ever had outside of salvation maybe a good wife and salvation he keeps you on your knees praying right i'm just sorry for the old boy because he can't be saved but whether you like it or not he's my buddy whether you like it or not he's yours too or would it be because he will make us come to the place that we're supposed to be well i don't like the devil there you want i hate him oh yeah most time you don't even know who he is you you called him around and said call him jesus jesus and worship the devil now that was his words a lot of times we think that it's god that's doing things when it's the devil or we think it's the devil doing things when it's god doing the things come on church wake up and let's at least we ought to be able to realize a little bit and see the day in the hour that we're living we talk about coming to a change of the body the prophet said we can't even have faith for divine healing hardly well i think it's about time to quit playing games i preached this 40 years ago why not keep preaching it now anytime a trial or a test comes we're to say thank you lord now what's to come out of this what do you mean you think the lord when you're sick oh you're poor your brother monk used to say and the guy said he then told him one time he's sick for the glory of the lord and then one time somebody said somebody got a leg off for the glory of the lord he said we'll cut the other one off give him double glory no we're not stupid or silly i don't go pray for a test to come i just know they're going to come right you don't have to figure them out they're going to come if you ain't been tested you're going to be why because the bible said every son that cometh must be what chastened it's for our benefit you know and i don't understand how come things are going wrong and we think everything's supposed to go right because we're a christian the prophet said you confess you're born again he said the devil turns every gun he's got on you go back in the bible and study some of those the lord jesus do it and we know he was right what about the apostle paul we know he was right what about all the others what about all down to the ages of the fox book of martyrs were on their own records the catholic church admit to killing 68 million christians burned at your stake done everything in the book and like the bible was talking about wednesday night until even the people the soldiers that was carrying them and doing these things to them a lot of times just got converted and walked right in with them right into the lion's den you know evidently if they got converted when they was going towards the lines then i guess you know let's go we're going home ain't no god i don't they better god he'd be helping us i wouldn't follow him would you but it would change around a little bit when i seen somebody and he was saying praise the lord i'm going to die today i'm going there that line's going to eat me up for the glory of the lord i'd rather be here than anywhere i must think about following him but no no we want to cry pity parties wealthy wealthy wu nobody ain't as bad as i am if you don't believe these people worse than you go sit in the doctor's office for a little while you want to go with me once every six months you know where i go do a cancer specialist cause they want me to go because they keep telling me i got leukemia you want to go in there and look at those poor old people and i just cry women sitting there no higher where the chemo burn them up and and then we get a bad cold i don't know what's wrong he said brother dale you shouldn't be that you're just preaching some good things i thought that was good to tell the truth you know listen to what your prophet had to say that's like i like to say it that way i believe what he says but i like to say your prophet you know you claiming to be a prophet go ahead brother let's look at this one waters of separation he's 1955 e15 he said i used to often time wonder what's the matter with the christian church they're so scared of things huh ain't nobody get cancer i'm dying right you tell you got a bad cold and you don't panic but they tell you you got cancer there's probably more people dying every day with a bad cold to do with cancer come on they're so scared of things well you got nothing to be scared about the first word nearly jesus said after the resurrection fear not don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a christian amen not even death itself can even touch the christian think about it he didn't hear my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from death to life amen death itself has no reign over a christian you know the prophet one time said death is my he he's my heifer i've got to that quote he carries me into the presence of god remember who was it the brother laying there and they come in and started singing the real sloth songs you know oh you know jesus keep me he said who's dying here you or me sing me some peppy songs death itself has no reign over a christian christ died in our state amen what a marvelous what what a faith that ought to be built up in the people come on something that'll total mark you'll never get nothing by being a jellyfish little jellyfish christian no sir did you ever see a jellyfish you just hit him he splattered all over everything really don't help you talk about a jellyfish and what it's doing said brother we need some christians not jellyfish but with a backbone that's right that'll stand oh i don't mean to fuss with people but stand for your god given rights that christ died for certainly not pushed around we don't have to be no sir we got we got an inheritance amen and our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited through accepting jesus christ and dying to yourself how marvelous yes sir satan says well i'll tell you what i'm going to do no you ain't going to do nothing that's the way to talk back to him say i know my position in christ and you just might as well get away ain't listening to you no more i got an inheritance but what do we do see we we want somebody to pet us right you remember right around and when they said something about that they said enjoyed something and the guy said i don't want nobody bragging on me he said you lied and i didn't there's something close to that you know we all want to be petted the husband wants the wife to pet him the wife wants the husband to pet him wrap her just human beings you know you know you don't get up every day and tell your wife how ugly she is you did you wouldn't have a wife lawn right we love to be petted and that's part of the human being but when it comes to christianity we're supposed to have a backbone brother made this statement one time about the children of israel and moses and i'll paraphrase it but he said he tried them people through all he said because he wanted to know when he got to crossing over jordan that he'd held the right people well i thought he knowed all about it well maybe he just kind of cuts things off every once in a while and allows us to move along in life but not be a jellyfish maybe somebody with a backbone romans 8 28 says what and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them are who are they called according to his purpose well if we don't believe all things work together for good to them that are that love god maybe we don't love god oh well i didn't think it looked like that in writing well why don't you read it and we know that all things all right now we're going to get down to something later in the message on the wednesday here a couple of weeks from now on some things about faith and how that really faith is it's a revelation but have you ever had a revelation that all things work together for good come on i'm asking you seriously i quoted that to a sister one time and she let me know in a hurry that she didn't believe it she said i got a husband dead and a son that's sick how can everything be for the glory of the lord like the way brother hamptons one time because i remember him saying this and it really well with me and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and to them who are the called according to his purpose if we don't believe that trials and troubles and heartaches is a part of the christian life we don't believe the word of god many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord leadeth out of them all now you mean brother dale that those people that were fed to the lines and killed and taken and just cut babies out of their pregnant women's stomach and feed them to the dogs and let them just stand there and bleed to death and talk about a loving god you know what if they hadn't done that and went into the ground you and i wouldn't be here that's one thing we ought to think about we wouldn't be here you think we're going out of here on a flower bed of ease oh but god loves his bride i've heard that love so much till i always got sick of the word love god loves his people he's not going to let them be tested or tried now i want that in the message i want it in the bible i don't give a hoot about your opinion of mine neither one i want in the prophet's message or i want it in the bible yeah but he just loves me so much till it don't matter what i do he forgives me oh you ain't forgiven you got a problem mentally first off second off spiritually all right well look all things work together for good to them that love god i know i'm a funny person i know i'm i know i'm made that way i'm just sorry it's my nature it's my way i know that i life and cut up a lot i know that but i can't stand it when everybody's down at the mouth so much you know bible says laughter is a good medicine oh i got what a prophet said we're not supposed to cut up i've got one too you know what he said i used to think that you want that one see i love to take what he says here 62 and go to 64 and see what he's saying could you take one and say all you want to but he said i even found out that jesus had a sense of humor evidently it was some kind of a comical joke among them that are called harry the fox then go tell that fox that was evidently had something to do with some comical joke but yet we're think see here's one side of oh we're supposed to be a long face and never be happy for nothing because i'm so spiritual you'd make a good monk go to the monastery in salaam but here's the other side half and glory let's try everything and and i get sick at this we were at a place one time and we had just cast a demon off of a lady i'm not kidding you she sat down and started playing the piano and then she started playing the piano this other sister that was so spiritual she started laughing and talking and above everybody doctor's joking and i wanted to tell her to shut up but you know what i would have done i would have hurt her feelings and 90 of the people in there because you see i can't stand it when you're talking about the lord and i know i'm number one you come and sit down and talk with me me and you'll talk about the lord if you want to talk about it but if you don't want to talk about it man you're going to talk about hunting fishing because i'm not going to override you and make you talk to me about the lord like danny we're sitting on a boat on fishing that's before he ever come to the lord he said now samus at any time you won't talk about the lord you just go ahead and talk about it well see i believe in the middle of the road the middle of the road somewhere they said brother branham said to keep you rolling up in the mountains i've talked to brothers it was our personally with him he said he'd keep you rolling telling jokes and life and then talking but you know when a man was serious don't you you know that but see we think we're so super duper christians until you know we're not supposed to have any troubles and what's the first question why is this on me why am i having this problem you know and i don't think i even assigned a number to it brother joe but it will be between six and seven if you can get it up there while we're reading it you know what it is is hebrews chapter 4 1957 901 the evening service certainly they got weary every time they get to a place when a showdown then what would they do they would fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me look what he says strange thing this morning after preaching that just as hard as i could there was many came into the altar and questioned it why does this happen to me it just got to explaining and preaching the whole sermon on people saying why did this happen to me and they come up why did this happen to me it goes over the top of the people's head that's what he said yeah we think we're so super-duper we have so much faith we're going to find out one of these days faith is a simple matter that's our problem we're trying to make it work when faith does not need anything to work it needs somebody to believe it nothing can happen to you and i let's go back now to number three i'll get part of these this morning which is taken from a message called i know in jeffersonville preacher easter message paragraph 36 it's those crucial hours that press us on to those sacred sands it was in the bible and remember no matter how great the distress is satan cannot take your life until god has finished with you there is nothing can happen to you unless god permits it there is no evil can come unless god permits it and as far is for your good he's working that nothing can happen unless god permits it now i've always tried to be sensible and be a human being to think about everything that's why i say we blame the devil for everything just because you've got a bad coal doesn't necessarily mean the devil's after you it just means we're in an environment where there's going to be bad colds there's going to be this and there's going to be that and when something comes more into the drastic realms you know job had a pretty good set of circumstances to lose seven kids and all of his crops and his camels and all of his sheep and whatever he had yes and he's sitting out there and he said his best friend brother around said a little puppy dog and he's scraping himself with a piece of pottery and his wife comes up and said why don't you curse god and die but all of his friends they right all of his friends instead of coming by and being sympathetic with him you know and even praying for him right what were they doing job you must be a secret sinner you've done something wrong now if you hadn't god wouldn't allow this to come on you god put this on you because you've done something wrong he said i've offered sacrifices i've done everything god told me to do he tells me anything else to do i'll get rid of that that's the way we'd say it right yes well yeah we have so much troubles you know that troubles make you a character i'm sorry to say that it makes most people in the wrong character but troubles makes a character development in you that be done for good or bad oh we want to blame it on mom and daddy right i ain't heard it from my daddy i walk like him i look like him back like me drunk my drink we always want to blame somebody else right you know if now what's the point if you want to blame somebody else for all of it then you can't give credit to god for him putting you through the test did you get that i just now caught that myself if you blame everybody else you cannot say god is testing me you say god was testing grandma you're acting like grandma but we all want to do that i just can't help but be this my daddy sorry to say he was old country boy that loved to get drunk and he drank up to about two years before he died but i don't have to be a drunk and you know what it evidently set a stage so i can say it now i'm not saying they didn't never drink i ain't never told nobody my kids didn't drink because i'm just going to be blunt they probably did they tried it i'm just honest my kids wouldn't do something like that boy you don't know about raising kids i've always told you my kids my grandkids my great-grandkids it's got a halo but it's held up with horns but how come none of us i don't know of any of my brothers now i told you i'm sure they probably drank i know none of my brothers and in my family until this day there's only maybe one or two that ever does any drinking to the extent of a volume you know getting drunk and out of a hundred and something of us counting or mower you know a family i don't know whether it put a point on them or what but i'm like everybody else i looked at liquor and different things never tasted it because i didn't care but you see most people won't be honest enough to say what i say you know the reason i didn't smoke when i was a kid couldn't afford it smoke rabbit tobacco grapevines coffee grounds fig leaves i don't mind being honest that's where you want to beat on the kids for doing things and you're the ones that done it before them and you had your day we had our bell-bottom pants and duck haircuts and yet you make fun of these with their pants falling off of them see you don't want to be honest because i couldn't afford to do a lot of things maybe you did maybe that was your downfall but you see i just didn't want to do it i decided smoking wouldn't work nothing i didn't have to be delivered of it when i come in this message i didn't have to quit drinking smoking gambling running around with women all them things i i just didn't do them when i was a sinner are you trying to make yourself something better i will say one thing i didn't do it and you did now argue the point yeah but you wouldn't raise up under my environment and you don't die when all the alcohol was there i've hauled boys to guilds for from guilds for the homer to get beer and bring it back and set it out of my vehicle and go over and walk over and sit down and they drank it i don't mind being truthful but you see i just didn't want to do it but listen folks we talk about god in his ways but do we think about god trying his children to see what we're going to do permitting things to happen to see what you're going to do i'm going to try to get to a point if i can right here in a minute okay he permits it there's no evil can come from god come unless god permits it do we believe that do we actually believe that right or is that just a quote i'm believing for your case but it's hard to me believe from mine well i got such a bad one yeah what about it look at the next one look at number four i believe it is yeah time tested memorial he's talking about the guy that built the bridge that they said would not be able to hold up over some body of water or some river or something he tested every bolt he done everything they said it won't hold that's what they're saying today it's your holy ghost religion you're talking about it won't be long let me stop right there and say this part you know sometimes we have this super-duper religious attitude about us and we're so up and old nothing is bothering us you know when we're really and then we just start deteriorating and then you know the women they quit cutting their higher quit fighting their fights then all at once you see a little makeup up here you see a little trimming of the hair up here you see a little something happen what listen if you don't know it i'll tell you because i was there right a sinner looking at you and seeing you and they see you put that little bit of makeup on they know you are no more than they are your testimony has gone out the window you're testifying we don't do this and we don't do that but then you do a little sip you know and take a little drink or something or you dress comes up a little bit you begin to show sorry i was raised in the world i know what a prostitute looked like and i know what they're doing to attract and then i see sisters doing the same thing but yet testifying i'm a christian i'm a believer like i told you one time i wish some of you wouldn't tell where you go to church because somebody's gonna ask you one day well what does your pastor believe about that you know maybe i'm all preaching got the medal in but that's all right i'm the one that gets paid the medal the only one in the building that's right all right but is it the truth what do you believe amen all right this holy ghost it won't last in other words it won't be long trill burned down but it don't burn down oh the fire only waters it now we should explain that one how can the fire water it if you take a jet airplane you begin to learn you know then a jet airplane they spray water in the cylinders ow right come on but it won't be long you'll go back to doing it but it only streams and it gets you a new hold every trial testing every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loosens the roots so it can go deeper and get a better hold every time sickness strikes you it's right you're home listen so has everybody got off the tree he said well what do you mean i mean just what i said the other day i know how the human mind works most of you are still thinking about the tree now that it winds well and how the small tree will lights it through a storm and you ain't listening now get off the tree every time sickness strikes your home every time that trial strikes your home every time the neighbors say something bad about you it's only shaking you loosen you up so you get down and get a better hold on the eternal rock of god's unmovable word that's how god does it he sends those trials and tests trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you a new hope to prove you was that what we read in exodus to prove you but what do we do it loosens us up to give us a better hold now we're not dummies i hope not we're not to go around and say well i hope something comes on me where i can glorify the lord but being gone don't worry about it it's gonna come you don't have to go searching for it okay lord one of it done that's the first question we ought to ask right that ought to be done what have we done that's fine that's human that's terminology that's human but then we realize we're not doing anything and it's the test that god has put us through to prove us now if those people back in the dark ages was put through those tests to prove them what should we think about this day like brother who would it brother bob talking about wednesday night that the preacher even would say i'm not going to tell anybody where i what i believe because i don't want them coming after me you know you remember the lady right around talked about said i got the holy ghost last night but said don't tell nobody she didn't get it i don't give a hoot she didn't get it it's like a house on a fire on a windy day you mean you'd be scared to go in and tell your boss what you believe my boss knows why i believe he read my books cause it's in his office he wrote on my report he said religious person constantly quoting the bible in his office with spoken word books he read them well i don't want nobody to know it i believe brother brown was prophet don't worry about you don't believe it now i ain't got a sign out in front of my house because i get tickled onto both sides right i get tickled at people there are people in the pentecostals you know go put a sign up in front of their house the ten commandments is in this place and then you go there and say well what about the first one that says it's just one god right you see what i mean you don't have to put a sign on your back run down the road we believe brother ryan was a prophet natar says a man he knows i worked with him week after week brother dick addison and i never mentioned brother branham i talked about the bible then one day he said where'd you get this i said now we'll talk i think my testimony is my my witness of what i'm saying i don't scream and holler to try to make everybody say they're believing a prophet brother tom fox bush he was pretty strong and bad he just go in the cafe and he called the waiter sit down i'm paying you you're gonna get a good tip sit down you ever heard of this you ever heard this you heard that i'm not making a lot of him i'm just saying i don't do it that away but you know what the brother gary atkins will tell you that he was spotting him on weightlifting brother tom was and brother gary made a mistake you know a good church to go to what are you going to do when a man got about 250 300 pound up above your head and he's looking down at you and said would you like to have the address and you just keep slowing that thing down you know you're gonna want the address in a hurry and that was brother tom i loved him and i didn't have a problem i told him personally don't do that tom i don't don't do that i'm not making light of him it's just his ways but there's people sitting here that come from that and you know the man sitting right over there he'll tell you in a hurry and there's another one raise their hand and they're the boy they'll say he said like uh which one would it move up in nashville or knoxville one and one of your brothers danny danny danny dan dan okay uh he said tom will buy y'all the food you want to eat if you're sitting licensed to him talk about the word if you want a meal just go sit down talk to him well he would and that's all right but i just believe just being every day i don't go down to my neighbors and tell him all about brother branham i don't have to you know why i don't have to if boys will tell you you know what they'll tell you one of them did just recently not too long ago was talking he said i used to because their kids are about the same age of our kids you know the boys he said we used to lay in the house up there and play games and things said listen to that man on that tape they know what we believe why do you think i opened up on the internet you think i'm afraid of the law everybody knows what i believe amen but i'm not challenging the law i believe in it i'm just saying be what you are god loves to test you he let people turn against you let everything in the world happen to test you to try you all right now let's get this license real quick because we got to get something straightened out right here all right go ahead and pull up because remember now the quotes we give you god loves to test you all right now look what james says let no man say when he's tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither attempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed now what's the difference between tests and temp webster gives it very very close webster will interrelate the word between test and temp and the word test is not in the bible you know so it's not a you know you can't look it up to try to find a uh definite point see god don't tempt you he tests you well i looked up dictionary all same word but what about it he don't tempt us but he tries us that's tempting is to provoke whereas test is a trial of your quality to prove so no man cannot be tempted with evil neither attempted he any man now brother dale what you're saying about all this sickness coming in the devil you're saying god's tempted no no god permits god don't tempt now there's a police officer sitting back here that can tell you the law uh you can't go down the road and and you know it's tempting for you to go lay down a handful of money and then they can't arrest you for stealing it he said yeah they can cause it laws is crazy now but if you pick that money up the law has to give you a time element to be able to figure out what you're going to do because you can go hunt for the people that it was you can't go out and a prostitute go to bed with a man and then say that they that he's propositioned them no because that's tempting so the law says you can't do that you're not supposed to to publicly put anything out there to tempt and then arrest even the law says that god does not make prostitutes to tempt men come on don't be going off on me he don't do that to tempt he permits it to come in to be test is to check out your quality you know god does test us but he don't tempt us right he said well okay we'll read what brother ryan said about where you won't listen to me go ahead brother pull up number six which is god in his own word preaching 57 3 23 3 44 god doesn't tempt men but god tries men test them god cannot tempt you but god can test you and every son that comes to god must be tested or child trained before he can be a son and if we can't stand chastisement the bible said we become illegitimate children and not the children of god because a child of god is born of god and he will stand the test anywhere anytime or any condition that's right a child that's born of god he that's born of god does not commit sin god had confidence in joke there's a lot of difference in testing and tempting i'll stop with that tempting is deliberately laying out in front of you some form or doing something and it's illegal to do that and then arrest you immediately and call you a thief you've got to give an amount of time for the person to be able to return the money or do whatever or carry it to the police or you know what you call that word entrapment all right now entrapment is a common word among us that means they trapped you deliberately traps you and see god don't tempt nobody he don't make these things come up in front of you to tempt you he permits things to happen to test well i don't know the difference in the word well all right then the difference in the word is satan attempts god tests all right satan tempts you but god tests you a lot of difference in it don't say god is tempting me to do wrong because you're totally out of the word and he doesn't test you to try to you know put it in the wrong point he tests you to let you find out what you'll do worked at general motors and these are there brother colley brother al brother dick i know for sure tony probably remembers it uh at a man named bradbury right he cashed checks when he cashed a check and he would keep the change off of the check and he literally cashed it he literally had a drawer just like a bank would layer you know things in it he had hundreds fifties twenties tens fives and ones but he didn't deal with no change he made more money cashing checks in a week then he made it working at general motors and he's also loan money well you know what he'd do any loan money attempted he loaned you 20 bucks he paid him back 30 on friday and he automatically deducted that from you to cash your check he was very smart my point is one thing he carried within his billfold from ten to twenty thousand dollars because he loaned money all week long these brothers know the story on the fridays or what day we got to thank he would bring from 40 to thousand dollars in a brown paper bag because you're gonna cash all those checks guy tried to rob him one day he also carried a gun he got by with it all right but he was a trainer on our line that i worked on and uh he never did like me too well from personal reasons one day he came down through there working and he had that big old stack of money in that brown paper bag and he laid it on my desk because he had to get some tools out of his pocket cover all you know to work and he forgot it and he went on down the line working on that car about five ten minutes later he comes down the line boy he was worried because it was the money was dire cash money no way to say it was his or whatever he comes walking down the line and more he's looking everywhere i said bradbury he said yeah i said open that drawer right there i said your money's in there he changed his attitude about me for you know still didn't probably like me but he changed his attitude because i could have put that money in my pocket and kept it from 40 to 60 000 it would have been no way he could prove anything and nobody would have seen it because nobody down the line knew where his money was he was asking i just took it when he walked off i took it stuck it in the drawer put some stuff over it my point is one thing god was testing me yes but he was not tempting me the devil allowed the man to put the point there to tempt me but i had no thoughts of keeping that money there was not even a thought not even a an inkling of keeping that money i would have fought you to kept his money because see i've always tried to believe in being a christian what would you do if you had an opportunity to pick up forty thousand sixty thousand dollars and walk off with it i don't mean a thing to me that means nothing to me i would just give it back to you well brother dale i have to admit i wouldn't do that well i have to admit there's something wrong with you is that blunt enough i have to admit there's something wrong with you now i didn't say there's something wrong with you if you thought about it because that's human i sold my home we did in 1973. sold it to my brother no so did my nephew my brother came up and offered me ten thousand dollars i had never signed no paperwork it was a verbal agreement between terry and myself he said i'll give you ten thousand dollars or a man did to my brother i said tell sam i give him ten thousand dollars above what terry offered him he said he ain't signed no dealings i know i said don't make no difference my word is my bond even my brother when he found out he said let him have it we'll divide the money you know i said no my word is my bond if we can't be that in human life let's don't even talk about all the other because you see sometimes god does test you to see what you're going to do well what does that guy do being a christian i'll let you talk about that in your own ways come on musicians let's my point is the world is looking at you and i and you know what at general motors you've heard me say it and these older brothers knows it i was oldest seniority hand on the labor pool which meant i could pick my job i could pick my job every day my supervisor you've heard me tell you about him he had to depend on me most of the time to be able to handle even what was doing because he didn't know what we were doing and people wouldn't even call him to try to straighten something out they call me they'd come and get me off the line and make me go do something to straighten up the thing but you know what every day i would look around and i'd see some of them guys and i'd say man he looks like he's tired you take that job sometimes we had jobs it was nothing more than just floating walking around moving nuts and bolts and maybe standing there putting washers on a boat you know sub-assembly they called it so you take that one i'll take this one which meant i was picking the strut up which was the whole shock assembly with your hoove on it which weighed 80 90 pounds and then having to hang them up on a hook and the hook got higher because they didn't stop point was what there ain't nobody that's ever worked with me said i didn't carry my load that i sat down didn't do nothing this weekend we were up there doing what to do i was up helping them do around the count when i had the right to sit back and say serve me boys i'm your pastor no i wasn't washing dishes moving things and doing things why because i believe in being a christian all the way through and i don't say god is tempting me with i know no but he's testing us satan tempts god tests he allows things to come our way to see what we'll do but you don't go out there and build it up and then bring it and set it in front of us he doesn't use entrapment he knows we're human beings and we're going to go through life and be tempted and tested but what are we going to do understand what's that spiral booth we're 88 in the spa anybody have a need uh is foreign everything will be all right anybody else is this happening we believe it we thank god that he's a healer and we believe he'll take care of you father in jesus name we send this to brother dean lord believe in your word that by your stripes he's healed in jesus name if we can't stand the trials and testings then evidently we're not the children of god is our sister's got a part of her family this problem is trouble we just send this firefox believe in you you laid it on our sister's heart to come up and we believe you father now just read down it to us know and faith taking my soul is and i'll say but in jesus having the problem this morning with the diarrhea the bleeding and things let's just believe it father in the name of jesus christ we anoint this prayer father we send it anybody else that's all god wants he wants to come among us and heal the sick and deliver and we'll believe it he said well i believe it we didn't just keep on believing it keep on saying it keep saying it and saying it let god make it manifest father we commit everything into your hands lord and believe in you that we believe your word that you're trying to test us satan's trying to tempt us but you're not trying to tempt us you're trying to test us you're trying to prove us you said you've done that to prove it you sent that man and let a sign even happen in there and the prophet deuteronomy you sent him or allowed him to go as we would say in tempting you allowed an old prophet one day to attempt a young prophet you had to permit that to happen and even though he lied to him you still took the young prophet's life help us not to be ignorant about our lives and our doings but to be able to believe and say god has allowed these things to come upon us to prove us to test us and let our faith anchor in you lord we love you we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed pray one for another sing the wondrous love of and jesus grace
