========================================

[Music] he glad he glad I [Music] willall amen good morning God bless so all together as we have come again to worship around his word and he will make us glad if we can yield ourselves unto him and be blessed know we talked to someone recently say I'm sick I'm hurting so I don't know what to do but the thing about it is he has already healed you that's right the only thing we waiting on is the manifestation and we will receive the manifestation of his healing we can be blessed and be well but as long as we have doubt that we are not healed we can't make it amen [Music] now I think I I think I found them in one of the pockets we're going to read this morning from St Matthew vers 21 through 35 let us pray Heavenly Father we ever grateful and thankful for this privilege that you've given us Lord to come together to worship father we ask you to touch our hearts father and open up our minds Lord that we can receive if we don't receive it in the spiritual Lord let us just mentally receive it and give it time to grow and come forth Jesus we thank you and ask you to bless each one that's present father we may have love in our hearts one for another Lord as you did upon Calvary Lord you suffered that we all may be free God and let us receive those blessings in Jesus Christ name we pray amen St Matthew 18 verse again verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how often should my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven laen unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to him, for as much as he had not paid his Lord commanded him to be [Music] so and his life wife and children all that he may payment be to be made I'm sorry my glasses something down what verse okay I'm sorry then the Lord of that servant was moved and compassion and loose him and forgave him the Dead the same went out and one of his fellows and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and Bes him saying have patience with me and I will pay the all he not him into prison so when his fellow servants saw that what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done should us not thou also have had compassion on their fellow servant even as I ped on thee so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you heart for brother his compassion amen God bless you you may be seated you know sometimes we think um brother collie just picks something to read and maybe sometimes he does but there's other times where you see the continuity of the spirit flow through the scriptures and just the theme of what's going on and I have have to say that just uh connects with what brother Bob was saying this morning about sacrifice uh it's hard to forgive sometimes people but you find Freedom in forgiveness and Jesus said forgive them there's something there that and you know sometimes you come to a place in your life where you say well maybe I've done something you know I shouldn't have done and and maybe I don't realize I did it and you go to the person and say hey forgive me and it opens up such a beautiful relationship that um God can work in those channels of forgiveness so uh we just thank the Lord that he can he's continuing to show us how to grow in Christ in him amen amen Amen brother Mar would you come this morning to yes sing that the more I [Music]

absolutely and then him picking up the mind of God that even the songs and and I I I looked this quote up this morning way before he started preaching it says I'm never in control of what happens around me but I'm always in control what happens within me I'm always in control of what happens within me m Mandi says You must be the change you wish to see in the world everybody's looking for that magic pill everybody's looking for me to do something or or brother Bob to do something or one of the ministers to do something magical and throw this dust at you and your troubles are over with your trouble started with you we'll help you all we can but unless you want to change your inside person your self- will as brother Bob was talking about it's what it's called self will you will will what happens to you I'm never in control of what happens around me but I'm always in control of what happens within me that's right amen that's so true but good to be in the house of the Lord good to have all of you with us today uh brother Lis has gone to brother Martin's today we're going to pray for him and uh sure enjoyed the sermon the Wednesday night that he that he preached for us I really enjoyed brother Andrew Glover this past weekend and everybody that helped we had a really wonderful time uh brother Aaron will be speaking for us this coming Wednesday night and then remember next weekend Friday at 700 Saturday at 3: Sunday regular service at 9:45 no second service and that will be brother Tim cross and brother Solomon Huffman will be with us looking forward to that now Resurrection Sunday amen we have Easter every week we honor the Resurrection on Sunday every week but there was one time when he came out of that grave and we're going to celebrate that next weekend also um I want to ask something of you Brothers on April the 14th we'll have one service and then after the first service I would like for all the men 18 years and over to stay in the sanctuary will not have a second service I think brother U Nathaniel Green's going to be with us that Sunday morning but we will have a meeting after the service is over all the men in the church April the 14th all right if you can't be here let me know all right because we'll tape it and but we will not release it to the public and I'm sorry sisters but it's just for the brothers okay you just have to you ought to be glad that you don't have to preach you ought to be glad you don't have to get a sermon you ought to be glad you don't have to deal with some of the things we have to deal with you deal with a knife amen so so don't get mad at me um I I was looking the other day um brother brandham had a had a fellowship breakfast with all the ministers and it was out somewhere in Arizona and this brother walks in and he brings his wife well there's no other wives in the whole building it was just for the ministers and he's politely explained didn't didn't tell the sister you need to leave but he politely explained that it was just for the men all right because me we believe men are the ministers We Believe men carry the gospel we believe you are our support sisters we appreciate every one of you and you have your place but as far as running of the church brother bram's always said and and Paul and scriptures always put the Levis or the Le levitical priesthood was all men so we want to meet April the 14th all right that will be in three weeks that will be one service Sunday morning whether I'll be here or brother uh Nathaniel Green will be here and one of the two and then immediately after that we'll have a meeting and I think sister Jim's going to the sisters downstairs uh maybe prepare a meal for y'all to eat and just hang around until we get finished but some things we need to talk about um things we need to uh uh find out the will of the Lord on and I believe it it's it's it's not just me am you you you have a part in the whole church okay so April the 14th one service after the first service the sisters can go downstairs or what more and I caution you brothers that what we do speak about that if you want to tell your wife that's your business okay but if you don't that's also your business okay cuz there' be some things that we're going to discuss discuss that uh that um maybe doesn't need to get out in public and it's not anything bad we're just going to try to get everything together and get all the air cleared well this is all new Administration it's all new to me I don't know how much we got in our bank account one time in 20 something years I knew how much money we had and that's because mama told me so uh I've never cared about that but I've got to start caring about it cuz I am the steward now of this church and the buck stops here and and y'all just decided that so we're going to try to figure out some things and and I'd like to do some things but I want your will I want you to give feedback to the things that maybe you want to see that uh to do in the church amen is everybody all right with that sisters you're all right with that don't don't be throwing stuff at me okay looks are thrown enough but just don't throw physically throw stuff at me okay but we love you all with the love of the Lord but it is the the running of the church should be with men and I know all know that all right amen so um we all have our place and listen we're in The Bride of Jesus Christ we're we're feminist we're feminist in the body so we have to have a headship amen we're we're feminist in the body of Christ we need headship but while we're here on Earth this is the way God set it up and it must be a good program because he ain't changed it and he ain't going to change it all right so we appreciate the Lord and we appreciate the message of the hour that gives us gives us Clarity on the things that are in the Bible and how to run a church and different things like that so is everybody okay everybody April the 14th after the first service we will have a meeting of 18 and older um of the adult men in the sanctuary here okay so now we're going to start talk about the people of that Alpha bride or the Ephesus Church age as we continue on let's read scripture and then we'll pray and you can be seated Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying Al Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and leosa now remember these are all physical cities we talked about Ephesus it's still there it's in Ruins but we're going to get into um irenius his age and Smyrna Smyrna is still a big city over there so they all have their characteristics and I want to tell you something real Qui quick everything that they have everything good and bad is piled up in this age right right and I'll read you a quote this afternoon where brother R says everything they get good and bad is right here in this age that we're talking in the age of Lea because there's no other age for us to go down and another age to come back up and then God's mind be released in in in another church age no this is it we're done this is the finish of all he has unfolded seven things out of his mind right straight from the mind of God all right and he put them in churches and he put them in cities and he gave them a characteristic all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man we know who that is that's Jesus Christ clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle so strange that he's got on a girdle up around his breast which is bride form listen Jesus is not a woman but he is represented in his bride that is a woman all right that is the female part like Adam and Eve Eve was definitely a female that's why in this day and time they get all that crossed up no they ain't never a man had a baby never since since Adam not a man has ever had a baby so there's a difference between a man and a woman you can decide that if you want to but I pretty much got that straightened out Revelations 1:16 says he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword let's pray Lord thank you for this day that you give us forgive us of our sins Lord as we reflect this morning on what brother Bob and and even the songs and the different things even what brother collie was reading the different ones lord it's all come together that we lord we have our self will if we get our self out of the way Lord you'll help us father I pray today that we'll get oursel out of the way that they'll not look up here and see a man with flaws and and different things but you they'll hear the voice of God speaking to each and every one of us father I pray that you'd heal the sick be with the ones that are not here be with the ones Lord that are on highways like brother Louise Lord and different ones the missionaries on the Foreign Fields I pray that you'd be with them Father just I ask your blessings on this service now in Jesus name amen you can be seated now look he had in his hand I was thinking about this morning he had in his right hand Seven Stars now if God had something in his hand he's going to use it so what's happening is he's not just going to hold on to those stars because out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword now where did it go did it go did it go just out in the airway no it went to seven different stars seven different men that hide the mind of God for each age that they lived in all right and we'll talk about this in just a minute but brother Dale preached many years ago about matching pieces well what happened was whatever God saw in that it matched what he saw before the foundation of the world and boom there he unfolded it to that angel that's why we believe that we had a prophet in the end time because Paul nobody has a problem with Paul being a prophet cuz he's way up under somewhere and we ain't got to deal with him but when you say God sent us a prophet in the end time they go wait wait a minute well God send seven Messengers all right Paul irenius Martin you can see him here Columba Luther Wesley and we believe that William brandham in the end time he identified with Malachi 4 and he identified with the forthcoming of Elijah and he and his ministry was identical to what supposed to be in the end time because remember whatever the alpha church was the Omega Church has got to be Paul had signs healings wonders and all those different things so did irenius and so did Martin it's funny brother Bob is talking about arenus we're going to talk about him a little bit today I'm telling you you read history on irenius oh my word what a powerful man oh yeah now polycarp was too but polycarp one thing polycarp leaned to getting everybody together and organizing and irus said no ain't dealing with that this is the word of God for the day so we'll talk about this afternoon we'll discuss that so the Seven Stars were the angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches so God didn't give an interpretation through somebody Revelations 1:20 that God speaking to us he told us we'd have seven stars or seven Messengers or angels and then the seven candlesticks are seven Church ages or seven churches and these seven Church agents is a complete final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentile Nations there was a there was a group back in the Old Testament but remember the Bible tells us they were given to us for example see we don't do polygamy anymore we don't we don't Stone people to death anymore there's there's human rights now there's different things that come up to the to this time where there's there's Grace all right there's Grace for that but it doesn't do away with it you can Stone somebody and not pick a rock up or you can kill somebody you can kill their influence and youve killed the person because what the prophet said so we don't have to physically kill somebody you can just talk about them and it what kills their influence if you talk about a man of God that way and he's a man of God then whose influence have you killed all right think about that so there's an announcement in heaven out of the mind of God comes to logos a sealed up message is open that we believe that God is a man all right he's not a spook he's not Casper the Friendly Ghost he's not floating around somewhere and has no being he's a human being yes sir he was the first human being because he stood one day way back in time and he said let us make man in our own image well guess what we are today we are human beings yes so God is a human being he was the first human being there ever was he's the only perfect human being there ever was and ever will be until we get on the other side all right we're working on it he's still working on me all right but a sealed up message is open in other words the mind of God as we see here a mystery is unfolded to the star not to an organization not to a denomination I was talking to a guy yesterday and pray for those people that are methodists because they're having a bad problem with one is in United and they they let gays and women preach and all that stuff and then you got a group over here well this group over here now kind of has to be their own self right they don't have they have a head but it's not like this great big United Methodist over here on this side and they're talking about shutting churches down they can't find pastors I told one I said come listen come listen I said I'll promise you one thing they won't be an organization stand up in this pulpit and tell us what we got to preach there won't be a headship except Christ that'll tell us what to preach there won't be nothing but this right here there won't be a filter come through a Methodist Church I'll promise you the Methodist Church is not what John Wesley started he would absolutely bust all of it up United and the other one but just pray for him there listen this guy was honest he really wanted his church to do good but he had another group of people that they wanted their own pastor this one had ideas over here so but they're all looking toward a denomination to take care of them yes we're not looking toward a denomination to take care of us amen God said he would take care of what his own God will take care of his own like we said before like brother Bible was saying listen we got to let go and let God we let God let God handle it give it to God instead of us trying to do it oursel absolutely hello somebody me too everybody but a mystery is unfolded to the star of that age so One messenger picks up the logos or the mind of God and it matches the pieces that God saw he said oh there's Paul Paul's coming in the age Paul has the characteristic I need Paul world would have never picked him especially the Christians of the day cuz Paul was putting them in prison Paul was having them killed Paul was making them blaspheme but said no that's my man leave him alone I'm going to speak through him and he's going to open up the Gentile dispensation he's going to be the one the messenger that all of Christendom from ad whenever it started 50s something till today is based on that amen it's based on what Paul preached there in the Old Testament and we have it in uh written form called the Bible called the New Testament amen but that still me God doesn't like to God doesn't like to hide he likes to hide in Simplicity but he wants to reveal himself in who in you and I yes sir in Messengers that open up messages and that studies as as brother Bob was saying you know get closer to God get the world out if you want to get closer to God get the world there's no magic pill amen we can anoint you with 55 gallons of this unless you want to get rid of what you got inside of you it will stay there that's right because that's your free will but if you if you'll quit worrying about well I worry about yourself remember what I just read I am never in control of what happens around me but I'm always in control of what happens within me you remember that yes there's no magic pill there's no quote there's no there's not even a scripture If you deny it all there's not even scripture that will help you you got to become a Believer then when you become a Believer scripture will help you then what do you do you you listen to it yourself listen you got to read your own Bible yes sir right you going to wait till Sunday and let me try to read something that maybe don't even pertain to some of you this Sunday you may get it next Sunday but this Sunday may be for somebody sitting beside you so if it's not for you please don't fall asleep but please encourage the person sit beside of you to listen to what I'm talking about amen but the pieces have to match God s before the foundation of the world right it can't change so that peace is going to always be the same so he looks down through time and he sees Paul so he drops a message down to the Apostle Paul Paul picks that message up a trumpet sounds in other words not a toot toot tooot but Paul comes out and proclaims a message yes right I've been sent to the Gentiles lo I turn to the Gentiles and and Paul said if there's an angel even come and preach something different different for me to let him be a cursed he was so bold in his preaching but he got that from as brother brandham he how you know listen I I'd say easy it's not easy but how bold could you be if you're standing there and you're getting ready to discern people and you don't know nobody in the building come on somebody and you're standing there and you have no clue except for maybe the people that came with you and you're fixing to bring a prayer line that you don't know nobody amen so you start depending on the guy that's coming cuz brother R said he's here now in other words that light came in building he was in another dimension he saw that light which he said was the angel of the Covenant which is no less than Jesus Christ himself in spirit form to discern now listen the mind of God never makes a mistake that's why you can see in the in the years that he preached in the hundreds of thousands of of discernments not one failed there was no guess workor God don't guess and listen he don't send Messengers that guess he sends Messengers that yield their self as as brother Bob and all those we have to yield ourself to that you yield yourself to your gift don't depend on mine that's right you yield yourself to your gift God give you a gift you're an individual that's right you got to find it though right I you know I've seen many years being in the message you and brother Dutch we went out to eat last night brother Dutch and sister April and we were talking about you know we we've heard many prophecies over many people that didn't come to pass amen that wasn't God everything God speaks comes to pass so you know it's the devil it wasn't God because it didn't come to pass but so that's what I mean he didn't he didn't just give Paul something and then Paul figured the rest of it out no Paul was a prisoner he was so sold out to he said don't want any more of that past I don't want any more of this and that and the other don't give me the he tried to get the Sanhedrin in he tried to preach to them denominations of the day and what did he do they killed him yeah right he went to Rome and they killed him he actually was a Roman citizen the reason I was reading on Paul the other day the reason that that there is no writings that tells us that Paul was beheaded well don't get quiet brother rown said he was so I believe he was but but to to tell you if you go back into into history Paul was a Roman citizen remember he declared I'm a Roman so they had to take him to Rome to be judged well Romans never were crucified ifed their punishment was beheading because Peter went to Rome They Crucified him upside down cuz he was a Jew right right but they couldn't do Paul that way because he declared he was a Roman citizen so therefore they say he his head was chopped off so that's where I and I believe it that that that's the way it happened but but you look at at the history and see well he's not going to be crucified so they usually crucified and beheadings the only two forms of death that that they put out there and and if he was a Roman citizen he wasn't crucified so they beheaded the Apostle Paul because of what because what he believed and history tells us that neero blamed him you know Nero was one of Rome that that the Rome burned and and Nero was the was the whatever it was he was the whatever he was in Rome he was the he was the head man so he blamed the Christians because of the burning so he had a bunch of people killed and they said Paul was included in that they just drug him out of prison and cut his head off cuz he was supposed to be the one that that tormented Nero so they did away with him that's what it's always been oh yeah listen you torment people every day if you're a Christian today you torment people every day by walking in him and given an example of Christianity or you don't right right amen you're a walking testimony whether you believe it or not you going to testify one way or the other right but there's a spiritual war start see there's opposition a war is two opposing forces fighting against each other one for one causing one for another so you got God and the devil fighting and remember whoever wins is the one you yield to cuz you're the deciding factor right so remember true word hits the Earth false do also hits the Earth because Paul said Grievous wolves will come just as soon as I leave Grievous wolves are going to be here and they're going to try to take over the church it wasn't Grievous wolves like they were going to have more prostitution houses and no more drunk no they were coming inside the church this is where the war is at folks right here today this is where the war is so that messenger brings his message he's laid away or taken off the Earth and we'll show you this afternoon and maybe if we can get to it that Paul died right almost in the middle there was like 60 something years or 70 or 80 years left of the Ephesian Church age after Paul died so who carried it you did Brother Brown's been dead since 1965 who's carried this message we'd have amen there was no message church when brother Brown died message churches developed after he passed away why because somebody else caught the vision the believe the sign the good sign not the other sign but believe the sign that God gave us for the end time and gave us a voice of God a a spokesperson that gave it to us in big chunks and then you and I for all this 60 years we since he's been gone we're breaking it down and trying to get the people to a body change all right cuz that's what the Bible said and that's what brother random said so if they don't if they coincide I got to believe in both all right so the people accept it or reject it it brings a temporary judgment or a plague on the earth spiritual death not so much natural death cuz remember we're not in a natural War Let Them Fight natural Wars out there we're in a spiritual battle right now that's right all right listen this is not a cruise ship this is a battleship all right not a picnic that's right we didn't bring forks and KN and spoons we brought swords that's right it's a battle ble I like what brother Ernie we were talking about brother Ernie last night I just I just I'm just waiting for Brother Ernie to walk through the door I miss him so much and brother Roy I miss him so much I miss him I want him back here cuz if I can get him back here we're going there I say I I mean all of us if we can get him back here as a bride then we're going to the real place we're getting out of here we're going to be as brother Ernie says we're going to be ejected on out of this Dimension and I love what brother Ernie says he said you know he said we're not we're not a bunch of humans having a spiritual um uh experience on Earth We're a spiritual being having a Human Experience on Earth cuz we're going right back to the spiritual part that we were before the foundation of the world but I miss brother Ernie a lot and some of the quotes that he made but but people are going to accept it or reject it there's going to be a temporary judgment or a plague spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger like I said before there was 900 and something different denominations when brother brandham spoke his message well when he went off the scene and then that message become alive in a group of people now there's 13,000 denominations that didn't do away with a denomination brother R didn't do away with one denomination no the devil just started building more just like Satan started when Paul left Grievous wolves they came in serenus and different ones they started twisting the word of God immediately started twisting the word of God so guess what immediately after brother Ram left the word of God was twisted he's got to come back he got to be a tent he's got to come back and get airplane he got to shoot a brown bear get in the word forget about all that get in the word of God absolutely so the next stage there's an announcement in heaven out of the mind of God comes the second fold of what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and then irenius not po now polyart listen he was such a a saint till he was burned at the steak he re he requested there be no no shackles right that's right and he requested to pray two hours and he prayed for everybody for those two hours then when they put the fire on him the fire started going away from him bending away from him never touched him and you know what they did they stuck a spear in him and instead of blood coming out water came out put the fire out so they built it up again they finally burn him but he didn't feel it he didn't feel that because the the the the the people the historians say that there was a a white dove that's right when he died there was a white dove but polycarp though had one thing I'm telling you that why am I telling you this because you would think as brother R said you would think looking at his looking at his uh track record that he'd be the messenger of that age but he always wanted to get together and get things organized into a a a denominational way and God hated that remember he hated that nicked and spirit but irus said no but now remember polycart was a student of John John the Baptist John the Revelator not John the Baptist John Revelator John Revelator passed on polycarp picked up and they wasn't no church a messenger but he had the word of God because he brought it and irenius was a student a polyart yes all right so irenius we'll see this this afternoon but remember the the the piece that God had in his mind wasn't polycarp it didn't match right it was ireneus that's what matched the pece of God's mind so that mystery is unfolded to the star or the messenger of that age he picks up the mind of God he brings a message to a group of people listen without the people there's no message that's right you can have 500 ministers in this message and no le I know what's going to happen brother Bob be one big fight 500 people fighting each other sad to say so we got ly that'll soak up the word of God so Mysteries unfolded to the star of that age and messenger picks it up the pieces match a group of people accept it and a group of people reject it that's every age we come down to this age though the only thing is is we're not going down we're going up cuz there's no other ages the Gentile ages fixing to be over and when it's over door shut no other Gentiles going to be saved God goes to the Jews right all right and takes this message to the Jews so now as we begin there's an age of Pentecost we saw that in ad30 the messenger was the Holy Ghost now Peter was the spokesperson but the Holy Ghost was the messenger the Holy Ghost was what came on the day of Pentecost not Peter it came and indwelled Peter and Peter became the spokesperson but he wasn't the messenger as we're going to see later on in leosa the same thing happened that was an age of pent cost in 1906 zusa Street and then there was no messenger the Holy Ghost was the messenger the oneeyed black man and and Seymour and param and different ones that that the Holy Ghost fell on and they took the message into isusa California and spread it all over the world and we sure appreciate them and they're going to be there but they weren't the messenger because they had flaws they were trinitarians they were baptizing in wrong Doctrine they were but remember then a messenger comes at the end of the age or the end of the Pentecostal age we're going to see it this afternoon we'll talk about the the lap over or the in between this afternoon because we're going to have to start laughing over the ages now we didn't have anything to lap over except for Pentecost to Ephesus but we'll see it this afternoon maybe if the Lord willing so Acts 2 and one the day of Pentecost was fully come and they were all one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared under them clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them what the Lost was divided himself God was dividing himself among the people and he come back as he said 50 days before that Jesus said go to Jerusalem or go go out and get in the room I I'm coming back but I'm coming back in spirit form not in the human form I'm fixing to come back in your form cuz we were his body yes on the earth so there came a sound of Heaven A rushing Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them clothing tongues like a fire and it sat upon each one of them now remember it didn't just stay sitting on top of them you know you see these pictures of Mary with this little flame or or this little glow around her head that didn't happen cuz listen if it would have happened to Jesus you know every time they see Jesus in the old pictures that you see there's a glow they would have known something no he was just as human as me and you were that's why that that was the part of God that hid himself he was so human they said you a man making yourself God no it was God made himself a human being for you and I to die for you and you and me for our sins cuz we're thinking humans we weren't born born virgin birth we're born in sin by a carnal mind and we needed a new birth that's why they call it New Birth and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together they were confounded because they didn't need an interpreter there was people from every nation there during the Pentecostal Feast they came all Jews and Greeks and everything else it it list them down through here right they didn't hear them in the Greek language or whatever the Jews were speaking they heard in the language that they yes just like what's going to happen folks I'm telling you when we get over there actually we're not over there when it comes here we're not going to need an interpreter you can be you can be a Hispanic and and you'll understand everything I say you'll be a a French and you'll be able to understand English right my brother's learning English very well but we won't need interpreters in heaven I'll hear him in English he may be speaking in French and when I speak back to him he's going to hear French praise God what a mighty God we serve amen amen remember brother random that happened him remember he was speaking at to a Hispanic child and or whoever it was and they responded back to him and and somebody said brother R said well how did you understand they said well brother Ram you spoke to him in Spanish he don't know Spanish God had took over his voice boy if God could just take over our being like he did the prophet and he can and he will take over your being if you'll yield yourself to it and man I believe that's the power that's coming back in the church the power is here it's just out here we need it in here come in here and then what's he going to do it's not going to stay there and be void it's going to accomplish it's going to speaked back and the logos is going to come out of the Bride we don't need another prophet in the end time this is it and then brother random called us little Messiah he called us a prophetic group of people amen and you know what I just believe that am acts 4:31 said when they had prayed the place was shaken have you ever play prayed and the house Shake where you was don't answer that cuz I haven't either but I wish that we could pray in shake a house amen the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God look with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were one heart one Soul neither said they any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common boy you talking about getting rid of your free will and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all and brother B tells us this is the summation of the first church age or the alpha Church thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard now not he's not talking about 1906 he's talking about ad30 all right that is the pattern there's no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern we still believe in justification sanctification baptism and Holy Ghost not shaking a hand not moving a letter I always and it it's not funny but it is we were talking to this lady and she's a Baptist and she was um Jeffrey and and uh not Jeffrey back here good to see you Jeffrey amen but um there was a set of twins Jun used to keep and they grew up and and their grandma or somebody was sitting in front of us and she turned around she said if that preacher don't change his attitude I'm going to take my letter somewhere else I thought that Pastor probably will take your letter somewhere else if you will follow with it but we laughed but they put everything Hey listen if you're a Baptist they put that on that you get a letter you get a letter of good standing and you got that letter and that's you and if you go to move over here you going to move with it it's going to move but you see that's the right hand of Fellowship that's that's well it doesn't matter what you do well yeah it does you may come as you are but you're not going to leave as you are you let the Holy Ghost get a hold of you you'll do what the word says I ain't got to sit here and pound it in your head right amen listen we're to the point now where I hate to say this but y'all know as much as we do You' got all the message even if if I say something wrong you go he didn't say that oh wait a minute that's another quote let me get this other one there hallelujah it's the truth anyhow used to a preacher would say that you'd have to go home get your books you know I was looking at Daddy's books the other day and I pulled one and stole one of his church a books but used it borrowed it you used to borrow stuff from the library right never took them back either did you so y'all still going to jail if they ever talk if I ever catch you but they'd have to pull a book Ask brother Colin brother do you have to pull the book out find that quote no now you can be sitting here today and all up I say something everybody looks down cuz they're either on their tablet or on their phone trying to find that quote Maybe don't know as much as we do but it takes a minister to put it together all right yes sir there's no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep doing look until the church ages close so the alpha bride and Omega bride had to be the same the one that started got to be the one that ends they got to be the same all right you got your book ends so now the alpha age or the Ephesian Church age started in 853 this was when Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enabled us to set the DAT of the beginning of the Ephesian Church age about 53 ad now I want you look at this chart you can oh that's big enough you can see it but you look we'll talk about this afternoon and I think maybe some of you have them if you can't see them there's one in your seat somewhere I'll get you one look you got an age of Pentecost over there this is the Gentile Church ages they're they're made in circles because because what happened was for those of you that don't know it that when brother Brandon preached on the church ages he drew a a um a pattern and what happened was is right after that God put it in the sky amen see every time something happens God put something in the sky every time God does something he puts something in the sky look it tells the whole world it's whether you believe it or not so what happened was the moon went through all these phases I think in one night is that in one night or some certain group of time that was an eclipse of the moon and every one of them was exactly and what happens is this is the darkness in the age this is the unsaved people this is the world all right it's not moons this is the world but the moon does represent what the bride all right so here you got in your first church age you had a lot more white than you did Black because what the pure unadulterated word listen Jesus Christ had just died he was over here everything was fresh on their mind right all right Paul picks up the mind of God Peter picks up the mind of God to bring the age of Pentecost and then Paul comes at the end of the Pentecostal age brings his message dies about right in here and it continues on and this afternoon we'll read the scripture about a porter what does a porter do Falls over everything but if you've been to a nice Motel sometimes how many of you been to like Rich Colton and different things there's always somebody standing at the door basically with a with a top head I mean really nice dressed now what is he he's the porter he sometimes will help you in with your luggage this will be for this afternoon so when y'all sleep this afternoon we we've already learned it this morning so but what that Porter does that Porter knows everything about that Motel wherever room is he knows whereever uh the uh the um the bathrooms and place to get something to eat that's the porter he stands at the door now who's the door the door is Christ he stands at the door he's not the door we're not the door that's right we're representation of the door but a porter stands and you come up and say Hey where's room 274 okay you go through here you get on the elevator on the right you go up to the third floor what room 340 you go up room go up third floor when you get off the elevator turn to the to the left cuz I'm left-handed turn to the left and then you there there's your number well see that keeps you from wondering you're not going to sit there and you you got a thousand rooms in this great big hotel and you're like where do I start well the Porter is the one that's going to start you in the right direction so that's what we'll talk about this afternoon there had to be a porter in every age that that told you what the door was and listen told you what was behind the door amen how to get through the door praise God yes and what was there behind the door there wasn't a secret remember that was the mind of God it was a mind of God opened up with Paul and ireneus and different ones that opened it up to the world now whether the world received it or not that's our business everybody with me so it goes all the way through and we'll look at this afternoon there is a there is a Pentecostal age there in the end time and then Elijah comes and brings his message to push us into eternity and we'll talk about that this afternoon but remember the messenger does three things he condemns the world rebukes the previous age from getting away from their first love and then brings his message we'll talk about that this afternoon now look brother R tells us that now each Church age had its messenger we know that Paul was the first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded the first seal was tore loose now see we got a lot of that get into that with the seals and even the combat Beast is included in all this now remember the combat Beast is what the lion the ox the man and the eagle according to what Ezekiel talks about the lonox man and eagle and then all different ones talks about the four beast in Book of Revelations well listen that is the Holy Ghost In You Yes given to you sovereignly by God not anoint you right but live in you sir and that lion that boldness of the lion was what Paul and then because remember Peter and them was what were they were in the upper room and and they had all the doors closed and listen they were going to die they were going to be killed they were hunting them remember Paul was part do do you remember do you know one thing I was reading Apostle Paul and I didn't know this Paul was born the same year Jesus was born 4 BC so he was the same age as Jesus while Jesus was on the earth cuz when he died in ad60 something he was 67 or 68 years old somewhere in there but he was alive in in Jerusalem when Jesus was there but he never met him you wonder why wasn't time for him to meet him wasn't time for him to meet him God kept them separated cuz remember you can't have two on the God God God's word is always true you can't have two Messengers on the earth at the same time who would they looked at Paul Jesus Paul no Jesus left Paul come and said hey that Jesus is one you kill he said I even put him to death yes so praise God for a perfect word if you'll just listen and watch and and let the Lord speak to you he'll even take you to as like these quotes and different things from different people I don't mind that one thing people quoting other people like Spurgeon and all the different ones now let's let's don't get into some of the other ones that that people try to quote I don't want no worldly quotes and I don't think we will ever have any but I do like quote listen let me everybody take your hands like this man I like it being the leader a little bit every once in a while close your hands like this you got it are you okay cuz I'm going to tell you something we ain't the only one God speaks to I didn't want you to start doing this I want you to hold it right here we're not the only one God speaks to amen God speaks to many people in many ways and in many forms but I do believe what he speaks and his truth he tells it to his bride sir listen he want y'all might hold stuff away from your wife I'm going preach now y'all might hold it away from your sweetheart but God don't God tells every secret he's got he tells it to his bride he tells everything knows to the bride he doesn't withhold anything that's why the seals had to break so that you and I could see who we are and the age that we live in it didn't break in the first church age to Paul amen no it broke to us for us to look and see that Paul was a messenger of the age that irenius was a messenger and that we need to listen to him Paul was the first messenger when the first trumpet sounded the first seal was tore loose Paul was the first Messenger as we found and what did he do declared war on what the Orthodox Church Paul kept going to that church you see him talking to the to the Pharisees you see him talking to the Sadducees and I love I love Paul cuz Paul got in a fix one time tell me about God helping you out of thing Paul got in a fix one time remember he went up and there was the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they were against him right all Paul did he knew Paul knew that this um either the Pharisees or Sadducees one them believed in Resurrection the other one didn't that's right well he just made a little quick quote and they start fighting each other and Paul left that's the way God does it he lets them F he lets the devil fight their s cuz listen bride don't fight bride that's right but Satan will fight you every inch listen he's so stupid he fights himself yes he's the biggest deceiver there ever was and he's deceived he knows how but he thinks he can win no devil you can't win I know he's sitting here cuz some of y'all brought him here I'm one he got here before y'all did and he comes to church when y'all don't so listen San hates truth so he hates truth he wants to be right there so he can trip you up that's why we have a testimony we have to have a test before we have a testimony listen I I was reading a quote uh must been this morning or something where somebody said listen without a cut the light can't shine through if you're all sealed up but if you have a cut or a scar in your life or you have a cut that light can shine through when you have a scar in your life God shines through that light and heals that wound that's the God we serve that's the god that we take with us everywhere we go and if there is a bruise and if there is something let the light shine through that listen we can't be defeated we're on the winning T I like that song that uh it's on the Contemporary radio station but but he talking about we're fighting a battle it's already won that's right God's already won every battle there ever was and we're standing here fighting give it to him he's already won problem is we get what involved self I can do it better than God can do it you know what that's Satan because that's what Satan said Satan s when Satan was created he said I think I can do it better than that no he can't can the war form say Satan was formed just like us he was created he's a created being and listen he's very spiritual he's not he yeah he is in the barro but he sure enough he is here he's fighting here this is the battle all right greatest battle ever fought is in the bride I like what um uh brother Jimmy Harris come by the house the other day to to uh to see Dad him and um stayed for a couple hours yeah he did we took him out to eat or June did and yeah so brother Jimmy and uh Lord willing to may get him to come preach for us but um and he said he would so but he he prayed for brother Dale and I mean he prayed a prayer that just we all cried cuz he loved brother Dale he still loves brother Dale but um but I can't remember what I said brother Harris now so I'm 64 booil I'll pick it back up in a minute yes so remember Paul come at the End of the Age all the messengers come at the End of the Age no it's brother Harris thank you Lord Brother Harris we were talking about something we talking about marriage and divorce and he said you know what he said marriage and divorce is for the world he said two true Christians marry that's true marriage the only true marriage in this whole world is in the bride cuz bride don't fight bride you remember that sister I wasn't looking at Jo but they don't and you it make everything makes sense when somebody just makes it so clear to you oh you should never you should never think about de here I am going you should never think about divorce if it's two Born Again Believers I don't care how much you don't like her cooking and how much he don't he stinks you work on it you work on it there is no divorce in two Christians okay now but now if you're not that opens another door that's why they had to be a Grace of marriage and divorce and everybody sitting here in this room I don't care how pure you are you still had to have Grace from your H first husband that was the devil that needs to die before you can marry Christ all right so so we can't all beat our chest and I'll read to you this afternoon actually that lap over or the brother ram calls it a lap over or it's a between the ages to me that's Grace to a group of people cuz if Paul died in ad. 60 something and and the age went over to 170 when irenius picked up well in between that the message of Paul came they preached Paul's message but then irenius come well they were still some people that was under Paul's time like brother brandham he comes there was a Pentecostal group that continued on even after he passed away that are going to be bride so to me that's grace of God instead of just going like cutting the water faucet off and said okay my messenger's gone that's it no he gives Grace to each age remember brother Brown told a sister she was worried about her husband or worried about her daddy or something he said oh don't worry sister said she's he's in another come from another age well it did that's what it is he come from another age praise God we've got Grace that we came from an age after the prophet had already left and a group of people put the message on Book and Tape form so that you and I could listen to it and read it anytime we want to now like I said before on your watch you've got quotes I'm not going to get finished so the angel of the Church of Ephesus these things hold us the Seven Stars in his right hand so God takes care of every Church age he's in every Church Age first the devil is not first with anything that's right except sin but he always copies what God does yes and then he what he twisted just a little bit Eve you'll die if you eat that fruit God said Satan never denied it through the through the Beast he said you won't won't surely die so eve took that part believed that part and and we're a product of it one word one word not God said you'll surely die Satan just put not in there you'll not surely die Eve said oh okay I'm not going to die so I'll just partake so I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou H has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars praise God a group of people as brother Ram tells us I didn't bring the quote where brother R say is they started saying you're not saying what Paul I wish we stand up one day and say you're not saying what brother brandom said well we have and you see what he got us brother Dell stood up many times he said that anyway brother R said well it's the truth anyway Lord that tried them which your Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne in patience and for my name's sake has labored and not Fain nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love and I asked you the other day I said have we left our first love is it just like when we first was on a honeymoon and and everything was peachy keing and it was just Huggy kissy or is it like two ships passing in a night one going in this direction other and they blow horns at each other praise the Lord anyway but they lost their first love they were in love with God the first days like brother the Bible saying and the quote was instead of Satan sending you to the to the drive-in movie he brings it into the house then he brings it into your tablet then he brings it into your phone then he brings it into your phone on your hand come on you ain't got to go somewhere to get it he brings it right to you but are we using that instead of using time for God right how to draw closer to God get rid of that Gap get rid of that Gap and and I'm guilty too get rid of that Gap if if we we will get rid of that Gap we now brother D you need to get rid of that Gap no unless you decide to get rid of the Gap it ain't going to do you no God you good with that yes sir but it is there you always come back to the same place it's me it's me it's what I do is what I take in today what did you come listen you'll get everything you actually thought you were going to get up this morning and come to church you will get what you thought you were going to get cuz you're in control of that right you'll get something from Brother Bob from from the singing and from me from different ones worship service and all the different things you'll get that oh by the way brother John April the that was on my list what day you going uh April the 21st brother John will be telling us how to spend our money but the second subject I shouldn't tell them they won't come so it's required reading whether you come or not you got to watch it no brother John does a real good job with that and we need it we need it to listen I always listen to a man that I work for he said look he said we got a pencil he said but you know you keep using that pencil it gets dull and that's where the PR sharpen your pencil come from not changing the pencil it's sharpening the pencil that God give you so we would need to sharpen our pencil every once in a while like Bob said get in the word more on Amen watch your finances a little bit more it's Revelation that God never changes his ways are as unchangeable as he is here it is an unchangeable god with unchanging ways what he did at the first he'll do until the last time for the Gentile and then he's going to go to the Jews there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's ministry will be the example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do now look he said what he wants to do amen CU remember man took over in the Middle Ages and almost kicked God completely out because of what we saw the U the moon was almost dark and that they call it the Dark Ages that's why they call it the Dark Ages cuz just to say you're a Christian they killed you now we've not come to that part yet you didn't have to come to you didn't have to come to this church in a tunnel that's right and come up through the floor and have to sit here and have people guarding looking out the windows to see if make sure nobody's going to come and kill you but they did in those other ages right they drug them out throw them in the arena and let Lions pull them apart and eat them I don't think you've been through that yet so we found out that God manifested himself in her and what the original Church the word can't change or be changed because the word is God so the messenger was the Apostle Paul Paul was the first messenger and he said in Galatians 1:8 that if an angel or any messenger any viker no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than what Paul preached let him be a cursed Paul knew that after he was gone Grievous wolves would come in he knew that Satan himself could appear as an angel of Light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now Paul baptized in Jesus name and and re-baptized where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order you see this pattern Alpha Omega what' brother brandham do he established church order again because they were speaking in tongues and they were doing this and they were running around in the church and and all that stuff you know like I told you before went to that Baptist church not too long ago well you know the guy had a Yeti cooler and or Yeti drink and he was just drinking away the ice was going clang gang clang clang clang clang clang clang while the preacher was preaching and the guy got his little latte out and I guess he finished it cuz he turned it up way like this we believe in Holiness we believe this is the house of God just like they believe that that Tabernacle in the wilderness that God resided in that Holy place yes now listen they couldn't all go in there but today you walked in yes hlj just got that you walked in where only one priest got to go in during the old in the Old Testament and if he went in there wrong he came out dead they had to drag him out right but you and I now the Bible says come boldly yes today you've come boldly to the throne of God whatever you need today you come here to get it or not right you what you pay for you pay with your time you set aside time like like brother Bob said it is it's a it's an effort to get here it is an effort cuz you fighting every demon It Ever Was to get to church listen sometimes y'all let the devil win but where's God today he's in the holy of holies which is inside of your heart sir the heart of every believer there's a holy of H holies that's why we believe in living Holiness that's why we believe what the Bible says about living holy separate from the world whatever the world does we're supposed to do opposite is know what the Bible tells us if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in you okay if you love to go to Walmart the love of God's Not in you but we have to go to Walmart I don't know why W I guess we use Walmart cuz it's a giant you know that and Amazon and all those we could say Target if I guess but see Target would have an impact I don't go to Target but every one of you sitting here go to Walmart from backy to right here every one of you has been Walmart the last week all right if you hadn't raise your hand y'all are Saints y'all in the church was met the devil and never I especially when I went by the when I went by the went by the furniture department and looked in all the mirrors you'll get that in a minute listen ain't there two things you got to realize number one where God is and where the devil is that's all you got to remember greater is he that is in me absolutely than he that's in the world we know we look at our we look at our enemy every time we get up in the morning look in the mirror that you're you're your worst enemy listen God has not put men in the Pulpit to solve your problems I hope you realize that that's right he puts a man in a pull pit to help you yes get through your problems cuz if all that live Godly in Christ shall what suffer persecution but remember I've always said what a Believer going through persecution is different than an unbeliever going through persecution cuz I wrote in my Bible many years ago tragedy defines a Christian doesn't destroy them this world goes through a tragedy it'll destroy some people they can't handle it but if you're a Christian and you believe God and you pray you're going to have trouble oh yeah but tragedy defines a Christian not destroys her listen what did tragedy do to job it defined who he was now we use job I mean this been 6,000 years ago right a man named job walked the Earth and he had issues right he lost all of his kids lost all of his business had no house to live in all of his his Mercedes got burned up cuz he was a rich man all those different his his Tesla caught on fire but God took everybody that away from him he said okay Satan you can take everything but his life praise God he's in control of everything even though you going through something like job went through even though you going through a battle God says Satan tear into them but leave their soul alone amen that person's mind you leave that part alone listen how many of us sit on an a sheep of our own home that we used to live in and had boils from our head to our feet I remember daddy used to have them long time ago they would they were putrid boils and he was scraping those boils to get the puss out to get the junk out and and he said though God slay me amen yeah I'll trust him he took everything away from him let's stand our feet we's stop right there we'll get into it this afternoon but though God slave me yet I'll trust him job had three good friends he thought they were his accusers oh job you did something wrong no it don't mean you listen sometimes it means you done something right cuz God is going to prove to Satan he's got a bride in the end time that will not fall she might stumble she might fall temporarily but she's going to get up and start over and take off again and Satan can't understand that cuz the whole world I I said the whole world's insane so they think insane yes but when you have the mind of Christ you said oh though God slay me yet I'll trust him come on now none of us get up in the morning and go God pour the devil on me no you pray God whatever the devil has see me through it whatever the devil has see me through it I'm going to trust in you like I said listen this is not a cruise ship this is a battleship and we're in a war but I'll promise you our chief Captain the one we depend on he's already won the battle for us problem is is we get
