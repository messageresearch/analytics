[14:27] amen
[14:28] let's give god a handclap of praise
[14:31] he's worthy
[14:36] when i woke up this morning
[14:39] did you have a doubt
[14:41] i didn't have a doubt
[14:43] i knew the lord was going to work it out
[14:46] problem is we try to work it out
[14:48] and then we want the lord to fix our
[14:49] mess
[14:51] that we made
[14:52] remember he don't make messes
[14:54] amen
[14:55] i was thinking when the
[14:57] brothers and sisters were singing up
[14:58] here wow what a powerful song
[15:02] but you know there's different kinds of
[15:04] fire though
[15:06] there's a consuming fire
[15:08] there's a fire that went on that burned
[15:10] a bush and didn't burn it up there's a
[15:12] fire that's going to burn
[15:14] after this world's over with in another
[15:16] dimension and the fifth dimension that
[15:18] kind of fire but there's a fire of god
[15:21] there's a holy fire
[15:23] that'll clean out your building if
[15:25] you'll let it
[15:26] and just like the three hebrew children
[15:28] i think about that a lot about the new
[15:30] birth there's three
[15:32] there's three hebrew children
[15:34] justification sanctification baptism and
[15:36] holy ghost they got thrown in a fire
[15:38] when they come out they didn't even
[15:39] smell like smoke
[15:40] it wasn't like that they were just i
[15:42] know they were odd that the people
[15:44] didn't get burnt up but they're like
[15:48] you don't even smell that they don't
[15:50] smell of the world in you anymore they
[15:52] ain't no smell of the world on you
[15:54] anymore
[15:55] because there was a fourth man in the
[15:57] fire
[15:58] hey man if it wasn't for that fourth man
[16:00] in the fire they would have been burned
[16:01] up
[16:03] think about that think of what a miracle
[16:04] talk about a body change
[16:07] that was just a precursor to what we're
[16:08] coming to but they come to they had god
[16:10] had to change their their body
[16:12] just for a moment though and then they
[16:14] came back and then they died but we're
[16:15] gonna get a body change we're not gonna
[16:17] ever die
[16:18] amen good to be in the house of the lord
[16:19] good to have you all back with us good
[16:22] to be alive good to be well
[16:24] um i want to make an announcement before
[16:26] i make the announcements
[16:28] i've been praying
[16:31] yeah i'm going to anyway
[16:32] um
[16:34] i've been praying about a certain time
[16:36] something to do this and i i want to lay
[16:38] it before you and uh
[16:40] get your opinion on it uh you know we
[16:42] got that new baptistery and this at the
[16:44] house
[16:45] and we need to put it together and use
[16:46] it
[16:47] um
[16:48] kind of make a run before we
[16:50] before we really do need it
[16:53] and find out there's something wrong
[16:54] with it so
[16:55] on may the 15th
[16:57] that will be sunday may the 15th
[16:59] i think we're just going to have a
[17:01] rededication service
[17:04] vow renewal
[17:05] rededication of the church
[17:08] and then have a baptismal service
[17:10] afterwards
[17:11] we're going to fill the pool up if you
[17:12] want to be re-baptized it'll be ready to
[17:15] go if you don't then we'll still i want
[17:17] to fill that thing up and and get all
[17:18] the bugs worked out of it before
[17:21] we have to have somebody comes up and
[17:23] says i want to really be baptized you
[17:24] know i want to get to
[17:26] get and i don't mean being frivolous is
[17:28] you just we're going to baptize people
[17:29] because we're going to try the pool out
[17:31] no some people need a rededication we've
[17:34] re-baptized people several several times
[17:37] but if your conscience is not clear then
[17:40] let's be re-baptized but let's have a
[17:41] rededication service on may the 15th if
[17:44] that's all right you all continue to
[17:46] pray well like i said we'll have vow

[17:57] service only have one service that day
[17:58] because if we do go to the pool we don't

[24:46] ourself to the lord
[24:48] think about that
[24:50] but we had to have a journey though
[24:52] we all had to have a journey we had to
[24:53] have a testimony so john 1 says in the
[24:55] beginning was the word the word was with
[24:57] god and the word was god and the word
[24:58] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[25:00] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[25:02] begotten of the father
[25:03] full of grace
[25:05] and truth you may be seated in the lord
[25:06] as blessing to the reading of the word
[25:09] and we're reading this morning in romans
[25:11] 8 verse 18 says for i reckon that the
[25:13] sufferings of this present time are not
[25:14] worthy to be compared with the glory
[25:16] which shall be revealed in us
[25:20] and i'll read you a quote a little bit
[25:21] later
[25:24] why it's to be revealed in us
[25:27] because it's the only way god's going to
[25:28] be revealed in the end time
[25:31] it's the only way god's going to be
[25:32] revealed is in his bride
[25:34] in his body the movement when he was on
[25:37] earth i was thinking about this
[25:38] yesterday when jesus christ was on earth
[25:40] that was he was in his body
[25:43] his earthly human body
[25:45] but now that earthly human body
[25:48] stayed under subjection to that soul
[25:50] that was inside of him
[25:52] what about me and you for the body of
[25:54] christ we need to stay under the
[25:56] subjection just like his body stayed
[25:58] under subjection and he abstained from
[26:01] things he was supposed to abstain from
[26:05] it did what was inside
[26:07] the control room was telling that man
[26:08] what to do and he was perfect
[26:12] and i read a scripture this morning i
[26:14] thought that says something about heirs
[26:15] and joy and errors did we not cover that
[26:17] oh okay all right
[26:19] that's why i want to that's why that i
[26:21] want us to see as we're as we've been
[26:23] speaking on the son of man that we've
[26:25] we've separated him out to be in the son
[26:27] of man and tell him what his
[26:28] characteristics are and all these but we
[26:30] need to pull that thing back together
[26:33] that we're now the son of man in the end
[26:34] time we're now the body of christ the
[26:37] only body that christ has is on the
[26:40] earth at this time in a many membered
[26:42] body just like you have many parts we
[26:44] have you know kidneys liver heart lungs
[26:46] and all those things they all fingers
[26:48] toes and all those different parts that
[26:49] are used
[26:51] to complete our body but it's all
[26:53] controlled by one thing the head
[26:56] one thing's controlled by the head the
[26:58] head controls everything i do that's why
[27:00] men they can't make they make a computer
[27:02] that's pretty fast but they never can
[27:04] make a computer that's that as fast as a
[27:05] human brain
[27:07] can't do it
[27:08] i don't you know this artificial
[27:10] intelligence that thinks before you do
[27:13] no that thing ain't got a god inside of
[27:15] it
[27:16] we got a god inside of us that can think
[27:18] faster than anything man can produce
[27:21] amen
[27:22] and we thank god for that and he
[27:23] designed every human being for that
[27:26] it's just if you
[27:28] decided you want to give it to god or
[27:29] decide you want to give it to the devil
[27:31] that's your priority and your
[27:32] prerogative all right so who is this son
[27:35] of man i hope i'm part third this is
[27:38] part 32 i hope you realize who you are
[27:41] you are this son of man that's my
[27:43] question i want to ask you
[27:45] who is this son of man
[27:47] in the beginning was the word word with
[27:49] god the word was god and the word
[27:51] was made flesh
[27:53] in me and you
[27:55] amen
[27:57] the prophet of god said we're supposed
[27:58] to be a moving
[28:00] living moving instrumentality of god
[28:03] we got to get to that
[28:05] to take a body change
[28:07] so that's what we're looking at we're
[28:08] heading toward a body changing and you
[28:10] know the a few questions were asked
[28:12] and and the good questions and the
[28:14] question was was if you won't mind bring
[28:16] that chart up over there on this
[28:17] on this side over here brothers
[28:22] and i apologize if i was a little quick
[28:23] this morning by
[28:26] wondering where that chart was because
[28:27] they couldn't find it
[28:29] now they found it
[28:31] i once was lost
[28:33] but now i'm found
[28:37] but the question kind of was well what
[28:39] if what if you you know what if the
[28:40] rapture takes place and and you're not
[28:43] at the headstone well i i i want to
[28:46] cover it later on
[28:47] but you'll have to die
[28:50] physically
[28:52] it's not my words you'll have to pass
[28:55] away
[28:56] that's what i mean that that we're
[28:58] facing
[28:59] we're facing either a body change
[29:02] or we're facing death
[29:05] because of unbelief
[29:06] i read the scripture this morning we'll
[29:08] read it again because of unbelief
[29:10] or you never were born again to start
[29:12] with
[29:16] is that right
[29:17] that's the three things you're either
[29:19] you're either born again and you're
[29:20] going to make it to the headstone the
[29:22] word of god is going to be in you just
[29:24] like it was in jesus christ in his
[29:25] fullness
[29:27] or you're going to have to pass away and
[29:29] go by the grave because you can't come
[29:31] to this
[29:32] headstone revelation
[29:36] you get quiet if you want to but that's
[29:37] the truth
[29:38] we're looking at this death right here
[29:40] if we don't make a body change because
[29:42] you can't come you can't the day of the
[29:45] rapture you can't be born again
[29:50] you hear me
[29:52] and not and your body not change
[29:56] well what if i die well yeah when you
[29:58] raise up your body is going to change
[29:59] but remember what brother brown said
[30:01] death does death is a vehicle to take
[30:03] you to god but remember too
[30:06] that's not in my sermon but we'll go
[30:08] this way
[30:10] what's going to happen now listen if
[30:12] you're if you're a foolish virgin
[30:15] you're going to have to give your life
[30:16] you didn't get the new birth you do not
[30:18] have the new birth in your soul if your
[30:20] foolish virgin and you will be left
[30:22] behind you will not make the rapture
[30:24] does everybody got that
[30:26] all the the only people that go into
[30:29] rapture are people that are born again
[30:30] in their soul
[30:32] everybody with me
[30:34] now that's we taught that for 50 years
[30:36] so
[30:37] um that should be elementary that's the
[30:39] principles of the doctrines of christ
[30:41] that i'm telling you about now
[30:43] so you must be born again to be born
[30:45] again you will go in the rapture
[30:48] but that doesn't guarantee your body
[30:50] change without dying
[30:53] now brother branham even tells us
[30:55] foolish virgins have to go through the
[30:58] millen through the sorry not the
[31:00] millennium that's not right
[31:02] go through the tribulation
[31:06] they'll have to physically die
[31:09] because brother brown said they didn't
[31:10] go all the way
[31:11] because what cleans you up
[31:13] the new birth is what cleans you up
[31:16] it cleans your body spirit and soul
[31:18] everybody with me
[31:20] all right so if you got the new birth
[31:22] today potentially those who is justified
[31:24] he's already glorified
[31:25] but now that doesn't mean that you're
[31:27] going to automatically take a body
[31:28] change
[31:29] no you got to come to a place
[31:32] to where brother brown said death will
[31:33] go up your sleeve and you'll just wipe
[31:35] it right off
[31:36] amen
[31:37] you say that's unbelievable well we'll
[31:40] see you in the rapture because we'll be
[31:41] doing your funeral
[31:43] and there's no there's no disgrace in
[31:46] that either
[31:47] because you're born again child of god
[31:49] you're going to make it if you're born
[31:51] again today you're going in a rapture it
[31:53] doesn't matter
[31:56] satan can't take it away from you
[31:58] god can't even take it away from you
[32:01] amen
[32:02] so you're going in the rapture but you
[32:04] may have to pass on because you come to
[32:07] a place you don't not that you don't
[32:09] want to believe anymore
[32:12] but let me just be real can i be real
[32:15] this is just home folks
[32:18] people sitting in churches that do not
[32:19] preach a headstone message will not make
[32:22] it to the bodies
[32:29] will not make it can't make it
[32:32] number one you know what happens the
[32:33] preacher stands in the pulpit and says
[32:35] well
[32:37] we're just going to take a rapture i
[32:39] don't know about all this but i i don't
[32:41] know if you get all that stuff and i
[32:42] don't know about this daniel 70 weeks
[32:44] and ah
[32:45] seals is for the jews and daniel said to
[32:48] easter for the jews and they just make
[32:49] it all it's all frivolous to them and
[32:51] they just keep on preaching their little
[32:53] sugar tit doctrines
[32:55] i'm sorry
[32:57] a little milk
[32:59] god sent a prophet we need to shout we
[33:01] need speaking tongues we need prayer
[33:02] lines
[33:03] sorry
[33:05] it takes the meat of the word paul said
[33:07] to make it
[33:09] it takes the meat of the word to make
[33:11] i'm going to read it to you right here
[33:12] in hebrews
[33:14] but that's just i'm sorry if you don't
[33:15] like that then you need to go find you
[33:16] somebody that preaches a sugar tit
[33:18] doctrine
[33:19] and i ain't saying that thank you
[33:21] brother colleen he said hey man he's
[33:22] been here longer most about anybody's
[33:23] been here except brothers already
[33:26] so he realizes you go listen to all
[33:27] these other folks i really don't care
[33:29] listen to them all you want to
[33:31] but i'm like brother dale and we're just
[33:34] home folks
[33:35] he said if there's somebody preaching
[33:37] any better than what's preaching in this
[33:38] church we need to listen to that person
[33:40] and let's go find them
[33:42] a progression a progressive message one
[33:45] that'll take you from the these people
[33:47] don't even preach on the statue of
[33:48] perfect man is that am i correct
[33:50] aaron raises his hand he raised his hand
[33:53] i think some people in this message
[33:54] don't even know what the statue of a
[33:55] perfect man is it's just a message in a
[33:58] in a string of 1100 sermons
[34:02] that's right
[34:04] daniel 17 weeks oh it's too confusing
[34:07] seals uh
[34:08] don't need that
[34:10] yeah you do
[34:13] you're not reading the same message i am
[34:16] but we'll read that in just a minute i
[34:17] don't want to be hard i know sometimes
[34:19] people look at you i wish you'd go
[34:21] somewhere else if you think there is
[34:22] something else
[34:24] because you're hindering us
[34:28] i'm sorry
[34:29] i did again i did it again i'm sorry
[34:35] luisa can't you wait till the end of the
[34:36] service to beat people over the head
[34:40] i said no
[34:42] yes i'm sorry no i re but listen when
[34:45] are we going to stand up like jesus did
[34:46] and say truth is true
[34:49] if you can get it from the pharisees and
[34:51] sadducees you need to go over there
[34:54] that's what jesus said isn't it but he
[34:56] said they are of you the fat of the
[34:58] devil and i am god
[35:01] now who said that
[35:04] who said that
[35:05] said a man
[35:09] can i read romans 8 one more time where
[35:10] heirs and
[35:13] see what i mean
[35:14] we've got it separated oh he can say
[35:16] that but we can't
[35:19] well i thought he's trying to put this
[35:20] thing back together again not separated
[35:24] lord i pray that they be one
[35:28] as you and i are one
[35:30] that ain't a bunch of people running
[35:32] around
[35:37] time to get in or get out
[35:41] time to go for it all and just jump and
[35:42] dive in if you don't understand it
[35:44] that's okay
[35:49] but i'll promise you one thing you can't
[35:51] have the baptism of the holy ghost in
[35:52] your soul
[35:55] and god confuse you
[35:58] can i say that one more time
[36:01] if you have the baptism of the holy
[36:02] ghost in your soul god cannot and will
[36:04] not put your play in a place where
[36:06] you're confused
[36:10] but now if you don't have the new birth
[36:12] you're confused already
[36:14] you're just confused you don't
[36:16] understand the principles of god you
[36:18] don't understand god because what he's
[36:20] not in your soul the only way the only
[36:22] way you can understand god is to have
[36:23] that that that um
[36:26] he's not complex but he's you can't
[36:28] understand him
[36:30] the reason we can understand him is is
[36:33] that i he is now inside of me
[36:36] and he's working his way out it's like
[36:38] i've always said you said you if you got
[36:41] the holy ghost and you read the word of
[36:42] god and you read the prophet's message
[36:44] it's just a rebound
[36:47] it's god talking to itself
[36:50] in individuals call bride
[36:53] and if you're confused maybe you need to
[36:55] get the new birth
[36:58] you might be confused but you won't stay
[37:00] confused if you get the holy ghost
[37:04] that's the only reason brother louise
[37:05] said i know i got the holy ghost
[37:07] the only reason i never had a sensation
[37:11] i never shouted
[37:14] never spoke in tongues
[37:16] but i know one time in kentucky
[37:19] when i said god i don't understand all
[37:20] this you're going to have to understand
[37:23] it for me
[37:25] and he said i'll just put me inside of
[37:27] you and then i'll help you understand
[37:29] because now
[37:30] having the mind of christ you ought to
[37:31] be able to understand what christ said
[37:36] so from that point forward brother aaron
[37:38] the word started opening up things
[37:40] started going
[37:41] fitting together i knew how serpent seed
[37:43] wasn't just sex in the garden
[37:46] it comes all the way down to here
[37:48] and we see it every day
[37:51] i'll read you some of these things in
[37:53] just a few minutes
[37:54] what a privileged people we are
[37:57] but brothers let's go all the way back
[37:58] to we're going to start at hebrews 3
[38:00] again
[38:01] we'll cut through some of that we know
[38:03] that teaching positionally places you in
[38:05] the church and you can never rightly be
[38:07] able to have faith
[38:08] until you know your position
[38:11] wow
[38:12] he said i got faith
[38:14] paul said if you've got faith to move a
[38:17] mountain
[38:19] and have not charity
[38:21] the new birth
[38:24] sounding brass
[38:25] tinkling symbol
[38:27] move mountains
[38:28] that's why remember that phrase that
[38:31] jesus spoke
[38:33] you okay
[38:35] i don't want to be too loud that phrase
[38:37] that jesus spoke
[38:39] he said if you say to this mountain
[38:41] there's no stipulation in there that you
[38:43] got to be a christian
[38:47] he just said if you can believe
[38:53] no stipulation that you had to be
[38:55] a born-again headstone christian
[38:58] no
[38:59] because paul then comes over and says if
[39:00] you if you think you've got faith to
[39:02] move a mountain and you can move a
[39:03] mountain but you don't have the new
[39:04] birth
[39:06] you're nothing
[39:08] sounding brass tinkling symbol
[39:10] that's why you see the bible tells us
[39:13] lord
[39:14] have i not
[39:18] lord have i not done these things in
[39:20] your name
[39:22] have i not spoken tongues have i not
[39:25] healed the sick raised the dead
[39:29] jesus said
[39:32] he never doubted what they did
[39:35] he just said depart from me because i
[39:37] never knew you
[39:39] i never had an intimate relationship
[39:41] with you you never got born again
[39:44] you took some kind of idea from a
[39:46] message believer a message preacher that
[39:48] says just believe the message and that
[39:49] seed's just going to pop up
[39:51] it's just
[39:52] there it is and you're done you've got
[39:54] all these virtues you what do you mean
[39:56] statue of perfect man well you know what
[39:58] brother brown is not the first one to
[40:00] preach that
[40:02] peter preached it
[40:08] that's why the prophet of god couldn't
[40:09] say anything outside of the bible
[40:12] nothing he could say was outside the
[40:13] bible
[40:15] brother branham you can make a 23rd
[40:16] chapter of revelations with what you
[40:19] have now what he had fit all the other
[40:21] ones
[40:22] what he had fit to 66 books in the bible
[40:26] so let's go to hebrews
[40:28] we were reading it this morning so let's
[40:30] go to hebrews 3 verse 6
[40:32] and start there
[40:40] i tell you listen folks if they hated
[40:42] jesus for his doctrine what are they
[40:43] going to do about me and you
[40:46] they didn't just not like him
[40:48] they hated him
[40:50] they hated him enough to kill him
[40:53] because of what he was a bad guy
[40:56] no because he told them the truth
[40:59] what's going to set you free the truth
[41:03] and he is the truth and we are heirs and
[41:05] joint heirs so you know what yes we can
[41:07] have the truth
[41:09] well well i you know what it's known one
[41:11] of these things i can't stand well you
[41:13] you see it this way and i see it that
[41:14] way that ain't the way it's supposed to
[41:16] be
[41:18] thank you can't brother's already said
[41:21] can't you can't
[41:22] you can't be a you can't have the
[41:24] revelation of the son of man and preach
[41:25] something else
[41:27] no way
[41:30] you can think you might have the
[41:31] revelation you can preach something else
[41:32] but that's you preaching it
[41:35] i read i was reading this morning
[41:38] you know the bible talks about doctrines
[41:40] of devils
[41:43] that god will allow preachers to preach
[41:46] these doctrines of devils
[41:49] and now what confidence in them was
[41:50] preaching
[41:51] but they were quoting
[41:53] moses
[41:54] they were quoting the old testament
[41:58] jesus never said you're misquoting the
[41:59] word he said what you've done with the
[42:01] word
[42:02] is you've took it and made it a
[42:04] tradition
[42:05] and not what the bible says
[42:07] so you've made it of none effect and
[42:09] you're of your father the devil
[42:13] you say that to somebody sometime
[42:17] you've got a different day than i do
[42:20] wow
[42:22] hebrews 3 verse 6
[42:24] but christ has a son over his own house
[42:27] whose house we are this is us this is
[42:30] listen this is not a pretty picture
[42:34] each one of you are or this
[42:37] each person in this building
[42:39] is a stature of something
[42:42] you need to be the stature of a perfect
[42:44] man or you can be the stature of the
[42:46] devil one of the two because he's a
[42:48] copycat
[42:50] he's going to head up a church
[42:54] he's going to incarnate human flesh
[42:58] because the son of man is going to
[42:59] incarnate human flesh
[43:01] us
[43:02] that's the separation
[43:05] the denomination should never be the son
[43:07] of man
[43:09] but satan can do all he can to get close
[43:11] to it
[43:15] that's how close it's going to be folks
[43:18] but christ is the son over his own house
[43:20] whose house we are
[43:22] if we hold fast the confidence
[43:26] and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the
[43:28] end
[43:30] end your journey
[43:32] wherefore as the holy ghost said today
[43:34] if you will hear his voice
[43:36] harden not your heart as in the
[43:37] provocation
[43:39] in the day of temptation
[43:41] in the wilderness
[43:43] they failed
[43:45] they failed god 10 times through those
[43:47] 40 years
[43:48] you know what he said
[43:51] when you get in the promised land this
[43:52] is what i want you to do when you get in
[43:54] the promised land this is what i want
[43:55] you to do
[43:57] he said i may let you get by with it now
[43:59] but you're going to pay for it later
[44:01] all right you're going to pay for it
[44:03] later
[44:05] moses all the different ones
[44:07] when your father's tempted me proved me
[44:09] and saw my works 40 years
[44:11] wherefore i was grieved with that
[44:13] generation
[44:15] i think god's grieved with us too
[44:18] for dilly dallying around and playing
[44:19] around and not getting on with this
[44:21] thing but somebody's going to
[44:23] because we're going to come to an end
[44:25] that's what it says right here unto the
[44:26] end
[44:28] wherefore i was grieved with that
[44:29] generation and said they do alway err in
[44:32] their heart
[44:35] and they have not known my ways
[44:41] wait a minute this is a congregation in
[44:43] the wilderness
[44:45] that lived under the law of moses
[44:50] but they did not know my ways
[44:53] they did not know my ways
[44:56] so i swear
[44:57] in my wrath
[44:59] oh we got mad
[45:01] they shall not enter into this rest
[45:05] everybody with me
[45:08] there's some people that's going to
[45:09] receive the new birth and not enter into
[45:11] the
[45:12] rest not that bob was talking about the
[45:14] rest here we're talking about the rest
[45:15] here
[45:16] this is a battle but there's going to
[45:18] come a time when this is going to seal
[45:20] us in and then it's going to be
[45:23] world outside
[45:24] god on the inside
[45:26] amen
[45:29] but now between that time it may be
[45:31] rough just like it was with the children
[45:33] of israel
[45:34] verse 12 take heed brethren
[45:36] lest there be in any of you an evil
[45:39] heart of unbelief wow
[45:42] take heed brethren paul's talking to
[45:44] brethren
[45:47] not talking to the world this is not to
[45:48] the world
[45:50] this is to
[45:51] christians yes
[45:53] so then there's a level there's a level
[45:56] of christianity that puts you right here
[45:57] the new birth everybody with me say
[45:59] ma'am
[46:00] then you've got to what grow
[46:03] see these shadows there's a little baby
[46:05] here a little bit bigger man or boy a
[46:07] little a man all the way up to the head
[46:10] so you can stop right here and yeah
[46:12] you're going to make it
[46:14] you're not going through the tribulation
[46:15] you're going to have all these all these
[46:17] wonderful things
[46:18] but god has got to have a group of
[46:21] people
[46:22] in the end time required
[46:24] predestinated to adoption predestinated
[46:27] to a body change predestinated to bring
[46:29] the promised son
[46:32] according
[46:33] to the bible
[46:35] so there's got to be somebody that's not
[46:37] different listen don't think you're
[46:38] different
[46:40] and don't think this just because we go
[46:41] to this church we're different you know
[46:43] what if you believe the doctrine in this
[46:44] church you will be different
[46:49] you will be different
[46:51] you will not be in the normal message
[46:52] camp
[46:55] sorry about that
[46:58] i never have been normal now
[47:00] ain't won't start
[47:04] you can take that any way you want to
[47:07] because most of you are
[47:09] take heed brethren unless there being
[47:11] any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[47:13] departing from the living god look but
[47:16] exhort one another daily while it is
[47:19] called today
[47:20] study
[47:25] you're not might not have to sit down
[47:27] and open a book
[47:28] but there's a lot of things i think
[47:30] about while i'm on my job and different
[47:31] things brother ryan i'll tell you my
[47:33] when i used to cut grass a lot what was
[47:35] my what was my congregation
[47:38] the gravely lawnmower i was driving
[47:46] so whatever you do during your day can
[47:48] you not think about god while you're
[47:49] doing it
[47:50] god has put enough intelligence in most
[47:52] of us to where we can do that we can
[47:54] mult they call it multitasking
[47:56] amen
[47:57] that's why brother dale is such a such
[47:59] an awesome testimony about him working a
[48:01] job that took two people to run when he
[48:03] was out
[48:04] and and god could still talk to him and
[48:06] he still had enough time to write down
[48:07] something on the seals because that and
[48:09] see you say well no brother i think the
[48:11] seals ought to be when you go out and
[48:12] lay out and you go out in the backside
[48:14] of a desert and you're just out there
[48:15] and the birds bring you food
[48:20] you don't have to worry about what's
[48:21] going on back at home your grass is not
[48:23] growing remember what i'm saying
[48:25] yeah no
[48:28] no in the mess
[48:29] of a birth
[48:32] in the mess of a birth it's when god
[48:34] shows up
[48:36] amen same way with me and you think man
[48:38] i'm going through this trial how can i
[48:39] do this and there's a way
[48:42] where there's a will there's a way all
[48:44] right
[48:45] but exhort one another daily while it's
[48:47] called today lest any of you be hardened
[48:50] through the deceitfulness of sin
[48:52] hardened
[48:53] christians
[48:55] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[48:57] sin for we are made partakers of christ
[49:00] if we hold the beginning of our
[49:03] confidence
[49:05] beginning of our faith
[49:08] confidence right
[49:10] steadfast unto the end amen amen
[49:15] steadfast unto the end
[49:17] let's go to hebrews 5 verse 8
[49:20] to 14.
[49:22] said though we were a son now we're
[49:23] going to talk about we've been talking
[49:24] about the son of man so here we are with
[49:26] the son though he were a son yet learned
[49:29] he obedience by the things which he
[49:30] suffered
[49:32] and being made perfect he became the
[49:34] author of eternal salvation unto all
[49:36] them that what
[49:38] obey him
[49:40] called of god and high priest after the
[49:42] order of melchizedek
[49:44] of whom we have many things to say
[49:47] and hard to be uttered
[49:50] why
[49:52] scroll up please
[49:55] seeing that you're dull of hearing
[50:00] you i'm not pointing to you but you have
[50:02] the choice
[50:04] it's not because i listen he didn't say
[50:06] it's cause i can't explain it
[50:10] right god explains something to you it's
[50:13] not going to be difficult
[50:16] satan can describe something to you and
[50:18] confuse the hound out of you but god
[50:20] cannot give you something and you be a
[50:22] child of god
[50:24] and it not connect
[50:27] if it don't connect
[50:29] there's not a birth
[50:31] because god's not going to do anything
[50:33] and not get something in return
[50:36] hard to be utter seeing you are dull
[50:39] of hearing
[50:41] for when for the time you ought to be
[50:43] teachers you have need that one teach
[50:45] you again which be the first principles
[50:47] of the oracles of god what are the
[50:49] oracles of god the commandments the
[50:51] bible everybody with me and our become
[50:54] such as have need of milk and not of
[50:57] strong meat i'm reading the bible i'm
[50:58] not reading somebody's opinions if i got
[51:00] that say amen
[51:01] this is not your opinion or my opinion
[51:03] this is god
[51:05] for everyone that uses milk is what
[51:09] unskillful
[51:12] that doesn't mean you don't get it
[51:14] it's just you don't know how to use it
[51:17] like i said before about here's thomas
[51:19] he's 10
[51:21] 10
[51:23] 10
[51:24] huh 13.
[51:27] what happened to you
[51:31] well you was 10 not long ago
[51:33] but here's thomas he's 13 and he's got a
[51:35] sister back there somewhere
[51:37] where'd that be
[51:39] oh hey abby
[51:40] she's she'll soon be 15 in just a few
[51:42] days we've got
[51:45] do not show these girls pictures on this
[51:46] camera i don't want no buzzards around
[51:48] here
[51:50] 15. you got that right i'm very i'm
[51:53] breaking the shotgun out again
[51:55] 15 15 and 15. i can remember when these
[51:58] two couldn't hardly walk
[52:01] t had to carry them around everywhere
[52:02] they went like this they loved him for
[52:04] his candy
[52:09] they loved him because it was tea right
[52:12] but they're getting ready to start
[52:13] driving but why weren't they driving
[52:14] when he was holding them like this
[52:17] they were babies they were unskilled
[52:20] because they hadn't what grown up and
[52:22] that's what god is telling you you're
[52:24] unskilled everyone that uses milk is
[52:27] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[52:30] for he is a babe now he didn't say i'm
[52:33] kicking you out of the kingdom
[52:35] you're just a baby
[52:37] and i'll deal with bait you know what he
[52:39] deals with babies just like we deal with
[52:40] babies we get out of line
[52:46] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[52:48] are of full age
[52:51] unfortunately
[52:54] when they get 16
[52:56] the law says they can drive
[53:03] the law
[53:05] says they can drive
[53:08] and they'll be legally able to drive
[53:10] because the law has said they have come
[53:12] to what full age
[53:15] not full age is everything but full age
[53:17] to drive a car
[53:19] i believe that's the way god is you'll
[53:20] come to a full age of one thing before
[53:22] you come to a full age of something else
[53:25] that's my point everybody with me
[53:27] don't don't fall out okay you okay
[53:30] if you're gonna sit up here you're gonna
[53:31] get it
[53:33] but you become it's like somebody we
[53:34] were talking the other day that virtual
[53:36] knowledge temperance patience got less
[53:37] it's not like you're filling it up with
[53:39] water and it's got to go to a certain
[53:41] level that one level right there and
[53:42] it's all right when i get all my tank
[53:44] full of virtue then god's going to give
[53:46] me knowledge he's going to work all
[53:48] those in
[53:50] together
[53:51] this is just for a picture so you can
[53:54] see that one step is from step here to
[53:57] step here
[53:58] because brother brown says if you jump
[53:59] way up here and not have virtue then
[54:02] what's he going to say he said you fall
[54:03] down you come down the ladder rung
[54:05] okay
[54:07] that's why god works on us different
[54:10] as we were talking about some are going
[54:12] to make it to here some are going to
[54:13] make it to here so i'm going to make it
[54:14] here but listen the bible says god
[54:16] wouldn't all come to repentance he wants
[54:18] the whole world saved
[54:20] and he has made
[54:21] a way but listen everybody the world has
[54:24] shut that way out
[54:27] it's only the people in this message
[54:29] that's going to come to full maturity
[54:33] i didn't say that
[54:36] the bible did strong meat belongs
[54:39] belongeth possession
[54:42] belonging
[54:43] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[54:45] full age even those who by reason of use
[54:50] what have i been saying all year use
[54:52] what you got let that thing out what's
[54:55] inside of you
[54:57] let it go
[54:59] good or bad
[55:02] but please change
[55:04] we all need to change that's why we're
[55:06] heading to a body
[55:07] change
[55:10] but who have reason of use have their
[55:12] senses
[55:14] memory reason conscious affection
[55:16] imagination
[55:19] is that not your senses
[55:22] that you're neat that you need to work
[55:24] on
[55:25] don't work on see taste phil smelling
[55:26] here satan's working on that anyway he's
[55:28] making us what we can't see we can't
[55:30] hear we can't
[55:32] god's not so let's work on the on the
[55:34] realm that that god can work on that's
[55:37] why we need a body change that's why
[55:38] it's got to work its way out it's got to
[55:40] have something inside that's eternal to
[55:43] begin to work out to make you outside
[55:45] eternal
[55:46] by you
[55:48] who by reason of use have their senses
[55:50] exercised
[55:54] well when we used to work out man
[55:56] it was like it was like an adrenaline
[55:58] rush
[55:59] for those of you that worked i know your
[56:01] dad did
[56:03] it was an adrenaline rush when i go in
[56:04] there and we start working out
[56:07] it felt good why because you were
[56:09] exercising your body
[56:11] your muscles are made to be used
[56:13] amen some of us use it in other ways now
[56:18] yes
[56:20] yeah and we get round we get in shape
[56:23] around shape
[56:25] but watch what this will help you do
[56:27] though
[56:28] watch what's this this exercise
[56:31] this reason of use
[56:33] will do what
[56:35] bob was talking about discernment this
[56:37] morning
[56:39] discern
[56:41] both good
[56:43] and evil
[56:45] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[56:47] you can't do away with that tree but it
[56:49] has some good in it
[56:51] oh it's what it says
[56:53] tree of knowledge of good and evil we
[56:55] use that tree of knowledge right now
[56:58] and i want to tell you those guys did a
[57:00] wonderful job
[57:02] because when y'all sing now
[57:05] you don't just sing the chorus
[57:08] because the verses are up there
[57:10] and some of the songs that you didn't
[57:12] know
[57:13] you got them on the screen and for you
[57:15] older folks to send big letters up here
[57:17] so you can see it
[57:18] we got one right here that we can see
[57:20] for us younger people
[57:22] but for the older people it's back here
[57:24] for y'all but i really appreciate that
[57:26] because you know what i don't want you
[57:27] you know who somebody was saying well
[57:29] we've seen the course and then through
[57:30] the verse we don't know what we're going
[57:31] to
[57:33] let ain't worship
[57:35] seem to sing sing out the praises of god
[57:38] you got to sing the uh the letter of
[57:40] what it is
[57:42] but that but look strong meat belongs to
[57:44] them that are of full age even those i'm
[57:46] sorry levi he told me not to move
[57:50] even those who by reason of use
[57:54] listen just try
[57:58] what does jesus tell the people
[58:00] try me
[58:03] try me
[58:04] lay something on me
[58:06] give me your burdens
[58:09] give me give me this
[58:13] i am available
[58:15] to receive this
[58:17] i can handle it for you
[58:19] the problem is we go i'll handle that
[58:22] i'll handle that
[58:24] no
[58:26] i thought the bible says seek ye first
[58:28] the kingdom of heaven and then all these
[58:30] other things will come into line
[58:33] so lay it on him he said to put your
[58:35] burdens on me
[58:38] give it to me
[58:40] and i'll handle it for you
[58:42] you've got to discern though what's good
[58:44] and evil though
[58:46] in everything we do
[58:50] as bob said discernment is knowing a
[58:52] difference
[58:55] i discern that
[58:57] brother callie is not going to ever be
[58:59] as loud as me
[59:01] never
[59:03] you didn't have to say that so loud and
[59:04] finally you said something loud and that
[59:06] was that
[59:08] man
[59:10] i'm gonna start using somebody else
[59:13] but i mean really why because we know
[59:15] that because what we have discerned
[59:17] through his life he hasn't had to raise
[59:19] his voice maybe he did admiring some of
[59:21] the kids but not not here
[59:24] right we discern that we know that
[59:26] that's his nature
[59:28] so same way with the word of god and all
[59:30] the things that we study we've got to
[59:32] discern is this good you say well the
[59:34] word of god is not evil no it's not but
[59:36] satan can use that word of god to make
[59:37] it evil
[59:39] one more time satan can jump in the word
[59:41] of god
[59:42] because what's he doing today he jumped
[59:44] into the word of god and he said oh it's
[59:46] okay to wear pants ladies
[59:49] oh it's okay to baptize father son holy
[59:51] ghost oh it's okay to do this he's using
[59:54] the word
[59:57] so he jumps into it but you got what is
[1:00:00] our discernment today
[1:00:02] we read the same scriptures they read
[1:00:07] not a different version we don't have a
[1:00:08] baptist version or a methodist version
[1:00:10] or
[1:00:11] even a message version there is a
[1:00:13] message version of the version of the
[1:00:14] bible
[1:00:16] yeah
[1:00:17] look at all these false doctrines you'll
[1:00:19] realize there is
[1:00:20] there's a message version
[1:00:23] but we got to use
[1:00:25] our senses
[1:00:27] exercise to discern
[1:00:29] both good
[1:00:31] and evil now here's hebrews 6 verse 1.
[1:00:34] remember let's go to it but remember
[1:00:35] what i said this morning this is a
[1:00:37] continuation of the thought of paul
[1:00:40] because he said therefore what after all
[1:00:42] this i just told you use your use your
[1:00:44] senses to to exercise your senses to
[1:00:47] know good and evil therefore
[1:00:51] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:00:53] of christ
[1:00:54] now look it's not like i like what a
[1:00:55] preacher said it's not leaving and
[1:00:57] leaving it back there it's bringing it
[1:01:00] with you because it's become a part of
[1:01:02] you
[1:01:05] it's become a part of you so you're
[1:01:07] leaving it as far as staying in that
[1:01:09] atmosphere of well i mean listen
[1:01:14] we may have a visit or two but that's
[1:01:15] okay people has been baptized in the
[1:01:17] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:19] do you have to be baptized again
[1:01:21] tomorrow
[1:01:23] do you have to explain to yourself
[1:01:25] why that it the bible says to be
[1:01:28] baptized the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:29] christ
[1:01:31] so you've left that
[1:01:33] but what you done was you didn't leave
[1:01:34] it there to change your doctrine you
[1:01:36] just took it with you
[1:01:38] so leaving
[1:01:40] leaving the principles of the new birth
[1:01:44] everybody all right with this
[1:01:45] leaving the principles of the new birth
[1:01:49] let us go on unto perfection so this and
[1:01:52] that this and right here listen the
[1:01:54] bible tells you right there you're not
[1:01:56] perfected totally by just being born
[1:01:58] again
[1:02:00] read it
[1:02:01] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:02:03] doctrine of christ
[1:02:05] let us go on
[1:02:07] let us go on
[1:02:09] unto perfection
[1:02:11] look not laying again the foundation
[1:02:14] look
[1:02:15] not laying again the foundation remember
[1:02:18] if you've been justified saying fine you
[1:02:19] got the new birth any sin you have come
[1:02:22] on people any sin you have from their
[1:02:24] backs gone
[1:02:26] gone
[1:02:28] never to be remembered again
[1:02:35] but you still got to grow
[1:02:38] because you got to go back through the
[1:02:39] process again
[1:02:41] to be sanctified
[1:02:43] is to have faith
[1:02:45] that god
[1:02:47] has already finished it
[1:02:50] you know your finished product at the
[1:02:51] new birth we've heard brother many many
[1:02:53] times you're sealed until the day of
[1:02:55] your redemption the bible says brother
[1:02:56] brown said they shut the box car they
[1:02:58] put a seal on it can't get in it can't
[1:03:00] get out of it
[1:03:02] but listen
[1:03:05] that product
[1:03:06] has got to reach its destination
[1:03:09] before it's any good
[1:03:11] you can load that box car
[1:03:13] full
[1:03:15] full
[1:03:16] of hamburger meat
[1:03:19] if you let it sit there a long time it's
[1:03:20] going to rot
[1:03:22] though it may be sealed
[1:03:24] but what has it got to do it's got to go
[1:03:27] to its end or to its destination before
[1:03:31] it's any good maybe the best hamburger
[1:03:33] meat in the whole entire world
[1:03:35] if it sits in there it'll rot
[1:03:38] if it sits in here
[1:03:40] it'll rot
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:42] am i all right y'all more awake to the
[1:03:45] morning afternoon you are this morning
[1:03:46] good we'll do this again of the doctrine
[1:03:48] of baptism look i'm sorry repentance
[1:03:50] from dead works
[1:03:52] and of faith toward god not laying again
[1:03:55] the foundation so we're not sitting here
[1:03:56] going now well now brother you're saying
[1:03:59] that we got to build another foundation
[1:04:00] no the bible didn't say tell you that
[1:04:01] and i'm not telling you that you got to
[1:04:03] build on the foundation you already got
[1:04:07] and if your foundation's on sinking sand
[1:04:12] oh i always was this seed i must have
[1:04:14] been born again when i was
[1:04:16] born the first time
[1:04:17] no when it says new birth that means
[1:04:20] your first birth wasn't good enough
[1:04:23] and you needed salvation
[1:04:26] you needed to have that old nature
[1:04:28] killed out of you
[1:04:30] and then god entered in
[1:04:32] by the new birth
[1:04:34] and birthed you into the family of god
[1:04:37] put his soul inside of your soul
[1:04:40] not that his soul was already there
[1:04:43] that can't happen
[1:04:45] you can bring me a million quotes from
[1:04:47] anybody you want to bring but there's
[1:04:48] one thing for sure i know
[1:04:50] when i was doing the things of the world
[1:04:51] there wasn't a god inside of me yeah
[1:04:53] there was a god it was a god of this
[1:04:54] evil age
[1:04:57] right right louis
[1:05:00] i was totally contrary to god
[1:05:02] so were you
[1:05:04] oh no i was this little miss goody
[1:05:05] tootsu i didn't say miss mr and mrs good
[1:05:08] two shoes
[1:05:10] make it broad rebecca make it broad
[1:05:13] so that you don't have to say well he
[1:05:14] was talking about the women no we all
[1:05:16] were dead
[1:05:18] we were all dead that's what the bible
[1:05:19] says you were all dead
[1:05:21] and trespassing sin now where is eternal
[1:05:23] life it's in the mind of god knowing you
[1:05:26] would come to it
[1:05:27] and you would want it
[1:05:29] more than life itself i was tired sick
[1:05:31] and tired of being sick and tired
[1:05:34] of the doctrine of baptism
[1:05:37] and the laying on of hands that hurts a
[1:05:39] lot of people
[1:05:41] it says we've got to get away from that
[1:05:46] of the doctrine of baptism
[1:05:50] what's he saying
[1:05:52] you know it's wonderful to preach on
[1:05:53] water baptism and we do every once in a
[1:05:54] while because we have new people
[1:05:57] but could you stand at every service no
[1:06:00] the one that wanted ruth don't shake
[1:06:02] your head so bad like that she's like oh
[1:06:06] but i mean what if i came in and and
[1:06:07] that's all i preached every service
[1:06:11] acts 2 38
[1:06:13] yeah right wow it would be become boring
[1:06:16] because i've already done that i've
[1:06:17] already laid that foundation i want to
[1:06:20] move on up a little bit further
[1:06:23] by the way day 66 more but 65 more bucks
[1:06:26] to preach out of
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:29] but that's your desire because you're
[1:06:30] pulling now you're pulling on what you
[1:06:32] need
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:35] of the doctrine of baptism and laying on
[1:06:37] of hands
[1:06:38] and of the resurrection of the dead
[1:06:41] you know if there's never a resurrection
[1:06:43] of the dead which we've seen in this
[1:06:44] church if there never was one that
[1:06:46] doesn't mean we're not mature christians
[1:06:51] you go back to the works part
[1:06:53] you can raise a million dead people and
[1:06:54] still be lost
[1:06:58] lost
[1:07:00] lost
[1:07:03] have i not
[1:07:04] let's go to the bible have i not
[1:07:07] lord have i not done this done that done
[1:07:09] the other yeah but you never knew who i
[1:07:11] was
[1:07:12] you never went on further with me you
[1:07:15] stopped and said this is it
[1:07:17] and of eternal judgment and this we will
[1:07:19] do look if god permit
[1:07:21] now listen that opened the door god did
[1:07:24] not permit them to come to full
[1:07:26] restoration in the first church age
[1:07:28] second church age third all the way up
[1:07:30] until this age
[1:07:33] so brother darty god didn't permit that
[1:07:35] to happen during the ages
[1:07:37] he permitted it to happen in this age
[1:07:40] because we're going home this is a time
[1:07:42] of leaving this is heading toward the
[1:07:45] end of the gentile dispensation
[1:07:48] for it is impossible
[1:07:50] for those who were once enlightened
[1:07:54] and have preached the message of the
[1:07:56] hour
[1:07:58] and have
[1:08:00] used the gifts
[1:08:02] may i interpolate just a minute
[1:08:04] and use the gifts
[1:08:06] and were partakers
[1:08:09] of the holy ghost
[1:08:11] not an indwelling
[1:08:12] partakers
[1:08:14] an anointing
[1:08:16] and have tasted the good word of god
[1:08:19] and the powers of the world to come
[1:08:23] i listened to a preacher
[1:08:24] with my own ears
[1:08:27] standing preach the best message i ever
[1:08:29] heard on the millennium in the future
[1:08:31] home
[1:08:32] and he was sleeping with a 14 year old
[1:08:34] girl during the time he was preaching
[1:08:37] message preacher
[1:08:40] preach like a lark
[1:08:42] i mean i got all kind of information
[1:08:44] from that message
[1:08:46] but was he born again
[1:08:47] obviously not
[1:08:51] it may be now but i'm telling you that's
[1:08:53] what happens if you get under an
[1:08:54] anointing and god will he'll use that
[1:08:56] anointing to give it out man read
[1:08:58] anointed ones at the end time
[1:09:00] it'll open you up
[1:09:06] but have tasted the good word of god the
[1:09:07] powers of the world to come if they
[1:09:09] shall fall away look at them now
[1:09:13] look at them now falling away from the
[1:09:14] message that preached the message of the
[1:09:16] hour i mean boom boom boom
[1:09:19] if they shall fall away to renew them
[1:09:21] again unto repentance
[1:09:23] seeing they crucified of themselves the
[1:09:25] son of god afresh
[1:09:27] and put him to an open shame
[1:09:29] now they didn't crucify the son of man
[1:09:32] they crucified that baptism of the holy
[1:09:34] ghost
[1:09:35] that son of god revelation you can't
[1:09:37] come off of a son of man revelation in
[1:09:40] other words you can't go backwards
[1:09:42] once we move into the moving of the son
[1:09:44] of man we can't go back to the son of
[1:09:46] god revelation
[1:09:48] we what therefore leaving the principles
[1:09:51] of the doctrine of the son of god we are
[1:09:53] moving on to the doctrine of the son of
[1:09:55] man
[1:09:57] can't go backwards with god you got to
[1:09:58] go forward
[1:10:00] all right
[1:10:01] that's why i told you we're trying to
[1:10:02] pull everybody we can
[1:10:04] everybody we can needs to have this
[1:10:06] revelation because it's required in this
[1:10:08] age
[1:10:10] no other age
[1:10:12] for the earth which
[1:10:13] for the earth which strengthens in the
[1:10:14] rain that cometh often up upon it oft
[1:10:17] upon it and bringing forth herbs meat
[1:10:19] for them to whom it is dressed receiveth
[1:10:21] blessings from god
[1:10:23] but that which bear thorns and briars
[1:10:25] man i'm getting ready to plant my garden
[1:10:27] and you know what these
[1:10:28] thorns and briar's already there they
[1:10:30] got there before the real seed did
[1:10:32] that's usually what happens
[1:10:36] and now under cursing who's end now look
[1:10:39] they have an end
[1:10:41] whose end is to be burned
[1:10:44] not by the fire y'all were singing about
[1:10:48] but by a judgment fire
[1:10:50] but beloved
[1:10:52] we are persuaded better things of you
[1:10:59] that'll just make you feel so calm
[1:11:02] but brother beloved we are persuaded
[1:11:04] better things of you
[1:11:06] you can do better than this
[1:11:09] and things that accompany salvation
[1:11:13] though we they speak
[1:11:14] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:11:17] your work and labor unrighteous to
[1:11:19] forget your late work and labor of love
[1:11:21] what climbing up that you perfect man
[1:11:23] climbing
[1:11:24] up
[1:11:26] it's easy to slide and back slide
[1:11:29] but to climb a mountain is hard but once
[1:11:31] you get to the top
[1:11:33] i've never seen anybody get to the top
[1:11:35] of a mountain and go
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:37] what do they do first thing they do
[1:11:42] i made it
[1:11:43] i made it to the top of the mountain i
[1:11:46] may be dead dog tired but i made it
[1:11:49] there's one there's one moment of
[1:11:51] exuberation and that's what's going to
[1:11:53] happen when we get to the body change
[1:11:54] there's going to be one moment
[1:11:57] when we're changing the moment of
[1:11:58] twinkling out we're going to say we made
[1:12:00] it
[1:12:01] we got there
[1:12:06] worth every bit of it folks every bit of
[1:12:08] this young people old people all this is
[1:12:10] temporary
[1:12:12] satan has put all kind of lust and and
[1:12:15] all kind of desire and everything out
[1:12:17] here just throw the table out
[1:12:19] for you to get it in this
[1:12:24] but if you ever get god down in your
[1:12:25] soul
[1:12:26] it'll be one of the best satisfactions
[1:12:28] you'll ever have in your life
[1:12:30] it will be the most satisfaction you'll
[1:12:32] ever have in your life
[1:12:35] and then remember as when he gets in you
[1:12:37] he don't just go to sleep
[1:12:40] he's working
[1:12:42] he's working that little that little
[1:12:44] that little kakeda is on the side of
[1:12:46] that
[1:12:46] tree and you might look at that
[1:12:48] thing that thing hasn't moved in about a
[1:12:51] month
[1:12:52] but all of a sudden you you look down
[1:12:54] and you see something going
[1:12:59] same way with the chicken if you put
[1:13:00] that little chicken under a light and
[1:13:02] you can watch that chicken the chicken's
[1:13:04] laying there like this for six months
[1:13:06] you know
[1:13:07] all of a sudden he goes
[1:13:11] there's life there
[1:13:13] he wants to get out
[1:13:15] he wants to what reveal himself
[1:13:18] he wants to reveal that's what god is
[1:13:20] god wants it to reveal himself who in me
[1:13:22] and you
[1:13:23] not in a cocada and not in a a worm or
[1:13:26] whatever else you want to say no he
[1:13:28] wants to reveal himself and me and you
[1:13:31] where am i at
[1:13:34] but beloved we're persuaded better
[1:13:35] things of you and things that accompany
[1:13:37] salvation though we thus speak for god
[1:13:39] is not unrighteous to forget your work
[1:13:41] and labor of love which you have showed
[1:13:43] toward his name and that you have what
[1:13:45] minister to the saints and do minister
[1:13:48] all right how are you going to get it
[1:13:49] you're going to get it by ministering
[1:13:50] all right now watch
[1:13:53] verse 12
[1:13:55] verse 11 and we desire that every one of
[1:13:57] you now this is paul talking to us or
[1:14:00] god talking to us through paul and we
[1:14:02] desire that every one of you to show the
[1:14:04] same diligence to the full assurance of
[1:14:07] hope what unto the end
[1:14:10] that's the third time he said it
[1:14:13] unto the end
[1:14:15] that ye be not slothful
[1:14:18] but followers of them who through faith
[1:14:20] and patience inherit
[1:14:23] the promise
[1:14:25] you got to get somewhere where there's
[1:14:27] an inheritance
[1:14:30] faith and patience
[1:14:32] inherits
[1:14:33] the promise for when god made promise
[1:14:35] here we go for when god made promise to
[1:14:38] abraham because he could swear by no
[1:14:40] greater
[1:14:41] he swore by himself
[1:14:43] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[1:14:47] wow
[1:14:49] blessing i will bless thee
[1:14:53] and multiplying
[1:14:55] i will multiply thee
[1:14:58] wow
[1:14:59] and so after he had patiently endured
[1:15:03] abraham
[1:15:04] after he had patiently endured do you
[1:15:06] know listen i wrote myself a note here
[1:15:08] somewhere
[1:15:09] from genesis 18
[1:15:11] is when the promise was made
[1:15:13] and circumcision was given everybody
[1:15:15] with me
[1:15:16] the new birth top of the new birth from
[1:15:18] genesis 18
[1:15:20] he waited till genesis 21
[1:15:23] to have the baby
[1:15:26] he took a 300 mile trip with grandma
[1:15:28] down to guerrier
[1:15:31] and give his wife away again made a
[1:15:32] little mistake while he's in his journey
[1:15:34] we're going to make mistakes in our
[1:15:35] journey
[1:15:37] but god said no no you come back here
[1:15:40] you got some work to do where i told you
[1:15:41] you got work to do about the time of
[1:15:43] life i'm going to visit you and then in
[1:15:45] genesis 21
[1:15:46] sarah
[1:15:47] has a baby
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:50] watch and so after he had patiently
[1:15:53] endured
[1:15:55] he obtained the promise he waited 25
[1:15:57] years
[1:15:59] but listen our promise is not just a new
[1:16:01] birth now
[1:16:06] sure the bible says the promises to you
[1:16:08] and your children then they're far off
[1:16:09] they'll that's the holy ghost that is a
[1:16:10] promise but what about our age
[1:16:13] the promise is full maturity is our age
[1:16:16] okay
[1:16:19] so meant for men verily swear by the
[1:16:21] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[1:16:23] to them an end of all strife watch
[1:16:26] wherein god willing more abundantly to
[1:16:29] show who unto the heirs
[1:16:33] me and you
[1:16:35] unto the heirs of promise the
[1:16:37] immutability of his counsel
[1:16:41] confirmed it by an oath
[1:16:43] in other words you look in genesis 14.
[1:16:45] when he calls abraham he says abraham
[1:16:47] abram he says i will do this
[1:16:50] i will do this i will make you a great
[1:16:52] nation i will give you a child i will i
[1:16:55] will god was making an unconditional
[1:16:58] covenant
[1:17:00] that by two oh here we come now
[1:17:04] we had an immutability
[1:17:06] now we have two
[1:17:09] immutable things
[1:17:11] two
[1:17:12] got to have two
[1:17:14] and which was impossible for god to lie
[1:17:18] we might have a strong consolation who
[1:17:21] have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
[1:17:23] the hope
[1:17:24] that set before us
[1:17:26] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:17:27] soul
[1:17:28] both sure and steadfast and which enters
[1:17:30] in what into that within the veil
[1:17:34] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[1:17:35] even jesus made an high priest after the
[1:17:37] order of melchizedek let me read this
[1:17:39] real quick brother brown said in hebrews
[1:17:40] chapter 6
[1:17:42] paragraph 5 80 says now listen
[1:17:45] that by two immutable things
[1:17:47] and which is impossible for god to lie
[1:17:50] all right they don't have this one so
[1:17:51] just just listen to me
[1:17:53] brother brown said an impossibility and
[1:17:56] immutability is practically the same
[1:17:59] word can't change it can't move
[1:18:01] it has to stay the same can't change the
[1:18:03] immutability and impossibility
[1:18:06] brother brown said we have two things
[1:18:07] yes first
[1:18:09] his word said he would do it second was
[1:18:13] he swore an oath on it and he's going to
[1:18:15] do it
[1:18:17] instead of swearing he swore by himself
[1:18:21] so he's the one that's going to have it
[1:18:22] done
[1:18:23] what type of people should we be why
[1:18:26] should we be tossed about and run about
[1:18:28] and take the things of the world and act
[1:18:29] like this 1957
[1:18:32] streamlined model christianity we want
[1:18:34] to be the old-fashioned type that takes
[1:18:36] god in his word and caused those things
[1:18:38] which were not as though they were
[1:18:40] if god said so that settles it
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] if god said so that settles it why do we
[1:18:46] want you know what we do
[1:18:50] it's like a man
[1:18:53] i'll tell this little story i won't call
[1:18:54] any names but
[1:18:56] there was a man in our community
[1:19:00] he owed us rent on a building
[1:19:03] and it was due in like april the 5th
[1:19:05] something like
[1:19:06] that well here it is april 20 something
[1:19:09] and
[1:19:11] so i call him up and i say hey
[1:19:14] rent's due it's the 20-something of the
[1:19:16] month
[1:19:18] he proceeds to send me this
[1:19:20] 300-word dissertation
[1:19:24] and trying to tell me like how the
[1:19:25] indian settled the country and i mean it
[1:19:27] just it just deluded everything
[1:19:33] i sent him a message back and i said
[1:19:35] look
[1:19:36] the rent's due
[1:19:37] pay the rent or we're going to take over
[1:19:40] i don't want to hear nothing else
[1:19:42] have you ever heard people like that you
[1:19:43] know look donny
[1:19:45] your rents do
[1:19:48] because it's late
[1:19:52] you owe the rent
[1:19:54] 90 cents back we said now chevrolet in
[1:19:56] 1954
[1:19:58] they made this car called
[1:20:00] an impala and they put this 326 inch
[1:20:03] motor in it and they come and they
[1:20:05] painted it green and then in 1965 so he
[1:20:07] goes through this two hour dissertation
[1:20:14] point
[1:20:16] point is
[1:20:18] what's that got to do with you owen rent
[1:20:22] that's the same way you know what that's
[1:20:23] what the devil does though he he
[1:20:25] convolutes or he or he waters down when
[1:20:28] god tells you to do something satan's
[1:20:29] going little blah blah
[1:20:35] and then you lose all that
[1:20:37] and donny never paid the rent
[1:20:40] i sent that message back and i said man
[1:20:44] you've got 15 minutes to go pay your
[1:20:46] rent because we're closing at 3 o'clock
[1:20:47] i said if you don't pay your rent i said
[1:20:49] your lock's been on that
[1:20:51] building for three months and this month
[1:20:53] your locks on it you owe the rent pay it
[1:20:56] or we're cutting the lock off
[1:20:58] he paid it about five minutes till time
[1:20:59] to go closing
[1:21:03] but that's nonsense to have to go
[1:21:04] through all that
[1:21:05] you sit there read the text and you just
[1:21:07] keep doing
[1:21:12] this that's not god folks when god says
[1:21:15] something
[1:21:17] you do it
[1:21:20] no excuses
[1:21:22] no watering down god's never watered his
[1:21:24] word down for nobody
[1:21:28] no he ain't gonna water it down for
[1:21:30] nobody
[1:21:31] he tells us and he's immutable so you
[1:21:33] know what
[1:21:34] that word immutable means unaltered and
[1:21:37] there is no change it is fixed
[1:21:43] it's fixed
[1:21:45] so let's just get into it
[1:21:47] it's fixed the way it is
[1:21:50] and it's not going to change
[1:21:51] we've got to change to get into him
[1:21:54] he doesn't have to change to get into us
[1:21:57] pay the rent
[1:22:03] but that's the way people are and that's
[1:22:04] the way that's the way the devil is
[1:22:07] well i can't
[1:22:08] i can't you know like we were talking
[1:22:10] other day about women wearing those
[1:22:12] leggings under the dress now you should
[1:22:14] not do that and never do it again
[1:22:16] i don't told you about that okay
[1:22:18] we don't want to do that not in this
[1:22:19] church whatever you wear under your
[1:22:20] dress is fine
[1:22:22] but when it hangs down below your dress
[1:22:25] it's pants
[1:22:26] i read you where
[1:22:28] the world even said it was pants
[1:22:30] so don't wear them all right
[1:22:33] do i have to explain that
[1:22:36] no i don't have to explain that you
[1:22:37] ought to know that
[1:22:40] it becomes a trend and it becomes a
[1:22:41] fashion do we want to be fashionable and
[1:22:43] trendy
[1:22:45] no we do not
[1:22:46] we want to be as far away from the world
[1:22:48] as we can get not as close as we can get
[1:22:53] remember who owns the fence
[1:22:55] satan owns the fence
[1:22:58] everybody with me
[1:22:59] all right we done talked about this one
[1:23:01] time i'm not going to talk about it
[1:23:02] again
[1:23:03] but don't be uh
[1:23:04] offended if the
[1:23:06] deacon walks up to you and tell you not
[1:23:07] to wear those no more
[1:23:10] i'm not going to dilute it
[1:23:12] i'm not going to convolute it
[1:23:15] just don't do it
[1:23:18] let's read this last quote we'll be
[1:23:19] finished
[1:23:21] yes i give this unto them so is this the
[1:23:23] sign of the end sir
[1:23:26] now listen to this i want to listen
[1:23:27] don't you listen to this and see how
[1:23:29] immutable god is how unaltered he is god
[1:23:32] send a prophet you know god what god
[1:23:34] sent a prophet for
[1:23:37] one thing
[1:23:38] put the word back together
[1:23:42] man had convoluted man had said no we
[1:23:44] ain't doing this we're not doing that we
[1:23:47] think this is what he said
[1:23:49] no he sent a prophet to say look
[1:23:55] but he did it with grace
[1:23:58] so listen let's stop our thought process
[1:24:01] just for a minute and let's just stay
[1:24:03] right here
[1:24:04] are they okay we're right here
[1:24:06] we're right there where the holy
[1:24:07] spirit's gonna seal everything together
[1:24:10] and start using you more
[1:24:13] as a unit
[1:24:15] so now let's read this they've got it up
[1:24:16] there
[1:24:17] now let's note a few of these mysteries
[1:24:20] if you want to write them down first
[1:24:22] i'll take what scofield you know what's
[1:24:23] in your scofield bible so you can read
[1:24:25] that first i'll take what scofield says
[1:24:27] in matthew 13.
[1:24:29] if you'd like to type some of them down
[1:24:30] if you haven't got a scofield bible you
[1:24:32] might read what do you think some of the
[1:24:34] mysteries are
[1:24:35] now in the 11th verse
[1:24:37] and he answered and said unto them
[1:24:38] because it's given to you his disciples
[1:24:40] because it's given to you to know the
[1:24:42] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[1:24:45] but not to them
[1:24:48] but to them it is not given so it's not
[1:24:50] given to the world
[1:24:52] everybody with me
[1:24:54] all right stay awake just
[1:24:56] ten more minutes look now watch the
[1:24:58] mysteries
[1:25:00] here is the mystery
[1:25:02] a mystery is scripture
[1:25:04] it's a previously hidden truth now
[1:25:07] divinely revealed
[1:25:11] but
[1:25:14] which is a supernatural element still
[1:25:16] remains despite the revelation listen
[1:25:19] folks it's not a revelation
[1:25:22] now for your sisters not to cut your
[1:25:24] hair
[1:25:25] i shouldn't be
[1:25:27] you should know that's in the bible
[1:25:29] and it's revealed to you so you don't
[1:25:31] have listen if you're if you're if your
[1:25:33] car is heading toward the beauty shop
[1:25:38] and it's something besides getting a
[1:25:39] little color
[1:25:44] you didn't think i'd say that did you
[1:25:48] then there's something wrong
[1:25:50] i mean if you make an appointment to get
[1:25:51] your hair cut
[1:25:52] women you don't have the new birth
[1:25:58] so it doesn't bother us anymore see
[1:25:59] there's leaving the principles of the
[1:26:01] doctrine of christ that's leaving that
[1:26:02] part but bringing it with us not doing
[1:26:04] away with it bringing it with us what
[1:26:06] and become more and more but why don't
[1:26:08] you cut your hair
[1:26:10] all because
[1:26:11] bro wait said not to do it now let me
[1:26:14] get right
[1:26:16] and it's not just that god said it
[1:26:20] there's a supernatural element there
[1:26:23] besides that being revealed to you
[1:26:24] there's an element in there
[1:26:26] you read the bible
[1:26:28] because the bible is giving you a type
[1:26:30] of cutting off
[1:26:33] your headship
[1:26:36] it's not just cutting to the hair
[1:26:38] you're cutting off your head
[1:26:39] because god wants you sisters to have
[1:26:41] long hair
[1:26:43] because he wants it to be a symbol
[1:26:46] or a mystery that the world can't
[1:26:48] understand listen 99 of this world does
[1:26:51] what cuts their hair
[1:26:53] oh i'm sorry 99.99
[1:26:56] of the world cuts their hair so they
[1:26:58] sister and they've gone away from that
[1:27:02] they've left the principle but they
[1:27:03] don't know what the principle is
[1:27:05] so it's normal
[1:27:09] to fill up the
[1:27:10] boutique or the beauty shop
[1:27:13] with women
[1:27:14] normal to them normal but you've moved
[1:27:16] away from that
[1:27:19] that doesn't bother you anymore so let's
[1:27:21] go on
[1:27:23] and say lord
[1:27:25] i don't want to cut myself off from you
[1:27:28] man come on people we are the bride
[1:27:32] we are the bride
[1:27:34] spiritually we don't let our hair i mean
[1:27:36] naturally we don't let our hair grow but
[1:27:38] spiritually we do
[1:27:41] everybody understand what i'm saying
[1:27:42] here's your supernatural element
[1:27:43] underneath the mystery the mystery says
[1:27:45] men cut their hair women don't
[1:27:47] what is that to me and you do's and
[1:27:48] don'ts
[1:27:50] it ain't dudes and don'ts
[1:27:53] it's a love for your husband
[1:27:55] to not do that brother the bible says
[1:27:58] brother brown didn't say this the bible
[1:27:59] says you dishonor your head
[1:28:03] and brother brown even goes so far and
[1:28:05] said if you do if you do wives if you do
[1:28:06] that your husband is duty bound to
[1:28:09] divorce you
[1:28:15] because you dishonored your headship
[1:28:18] that's how serious it is
[1:28:20] everybody with me got a little quiet
[1:28:22] there for a second
[1:28:25] but that's the supernatural revelation
[1:28:26] that me and you got to get
[1:28:28] that element underneath it none of us
[1:28:31] are supposed to cut our hair off
[1:28:34] because you cut yourself off from christ
[1:28:38] right nobody with me there so you say
[1:28:40] well no that it's just do's and don'ts
[1:28:42] no there's a supernatural element all
[1:28:44] under that mystery
[1:28:46] there's something like marriage in
[1:28:48] divorce you take serpent seed
[1:28:50] tied directly to marriage in divorce
[1:28:53] but i didn't know that when i was 14
[1:28:54] years old didn't have the new birth i
[1:28:56] just read to where where um
[1:28:58] she was beguiled and and sister rebecca
[1:29:00] i knew about what happened in the garden
[1:29:02] before
[1:29:03] it was a revelation
[1:29:05] but see i couldn't fit everything
[1:29:06] together
[1:29:08] because that was one of the great
[1:29:09] mysteries in the end time and i'll read
[1:29:10] what brother brown says in a minute
[1:29:13] but i couldn't tie it together in that
[1:29:14] me and you had a problem with it
[1:29:20] christ can divorce us
[1:29:22] for having another husband
[1:29:27] that's the supernatural element the
[1:29:29] natural element says if your wife runs
[1:29:30] around on you you can divorce and marry
[1:29:32] another woman
[1:29:34] anybody okay with that
[1:29:35] you look when you start saying marriage
[1:29:37] and divorce man people like
[1:29:43] imagine divorce has never been one of
[1:29:44] these
[1:29:47] preacher ever gets preached in marriage
[1:29:49] and divorce none of this happens
[1:29:50] everybody's like
[1:29:52] let's go home
[1:29:59] supposed to shout over everything you
[1:30:00] hear
[1:30:05] all right trying to break it up a little
[1:30:06] bit
[1:30:07] but there's the supernatural element
[1:30:09] brother brown tells us there's a
[1:30:10] supernatural element still remains
[1:30:12] despite the revelation
[1:30:14] the greater mysteries and the great
[1:30:16] mysteries are now he he quotes them from
[1:30:19] from schofield but he continues on
[1:30:21] listen to this
[1:30:23] number one
[1:30:24] the mystery of the kingdom of heaven
[1:30:27] that's the one we're talking on now
[1:30:28] matthew 13 3 to 50.
[1:30:31] now how many people in this world know
[1:30:34] what the kingdom of heaven is it's a
[1:30:36] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:37] it's not a kingdom set up over here
[1:30:40] that's the new city that's the
[1:30:41] supernatural element underneath the
[1:30:43] revelation that you're the city
[1:30:46] but there's going to be a physical city
[1:30:48] over here and not everybody's going to
[1:30:51] live in it
[1:30:53] only the bride
[1:30:55] is going to live in that city
[1:30:58] that's the supernatural element
[1:31:00] underneath the revelation
[1:31:02] now second mystery is a mystery of what
[1:31:05] israel's blindness
[1:31:07] during this age
[1:31:09] in other words not during this age
[1:31:10] layout to see it during this gentile age
[1:31:14] because they were blinded down here
[1:31:15] remember
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:17] why were they blinded
[1:31:21] why were they blinded so they couldn't
[1:31:23] see who christ was but we could
[1:31:26] great mystery
[1:31:28] do we see him now the way we're supposed
[1:31:29] to that's my question to you
[1:31:32] but with the supernatural element i can
[1:31:33] see that that son of man's here today
[1:31:37] the world don't know anything about the
[1:31:39] son of man
[1:31:42] sorry the denominations don't know
[1:31:44] anything about the son of man
[1:31:46] oh he was god and he was he was the
[1:31:48] second person in human flesh and and um
[1:31:51] he was my savior and that's fine
[1:31:54] that's fine in their little box
[1:31:56] but we're not in that box
[1:31:58] it's not our box to have
[1:32:00] we left that principle and brought it
[1:32:02] with us though and got rid of the bad
[1:32:04] part which was the trinitarian doctrine
[1:32:07] and the false baptism took the real
[1:32:09] baptism and we've continued on
[1:32:12] keep growing all right everybody okay
[1:32:14] we've got about 10 more minutes
[1:32:16] the third mystery is the mystery of the
[1:32:18] translation of the living saints
[1:32:22] go to your denominations and ask them
[1:32:24] say
[1:32:25] do we all have to die yes we're all
[1:32:27] going to die
[1:32:30] donny
[1:32:32] oh yeah we what do you mean you go read
[1:32:34] them the bible
[1:32:36] we which are alive and remain
[1:32:38] oh well we got all that because mama
[1:32:41] said
[1:32:42] you ever heard that before
[1:32:44] mama said
[1:32:46] well like i said before i got in trouble
[1:32:48] with it if mama said that she's a liar
[1:32:52] she's deceived i'm sorry
[1:32:55] i'm talking about mama church see you
[1:32:56] got the you got to get to revelation
[1:32:58] underneath the mystery here
[1:33:00] mama church is telling us all things are
[1:33:01] okay these are all right don't worry
[1:33:03] about it if you don't get saved the
[1:33:05] first time you'll get another chance
[1:33:07] that's a lie
[1:33:10] he is filthy filthy still righteous
[1:33:12] righteous still where'd that come from
[1:33:14] that's the bible
[1:33:16] third mystery is a mystery of the
[1:33:17] translation of living saints at the end
[1:33:19] time of this age
[1:33:23] that mystery
[1:33:24] we understand and what's the
[1:33:26] supernatural element underneath that
[1:33:28] it's me and you
[1:33:31] me and you
[1:33:32] not a group
[1:33:35] an individual
[1:33:40] the fourth mystery of the new testament
[1:33:42] church
[1:33:43] is one body composed of jews
[1:33:46] and gentiles
[1:33:49] i'll continue on because i'll cover this
[1:33:50] again i will back up on this let's go
[1:33:52] the fifth mystery because there's about
[1:33:54] 11 of them
[1:33:55] this fifth mystery is of the church as
[1:33:58] the bride of christ
[1:34:00] remember brother brown had to separate
[1:34:02] him he said this is the church
[1:34:05] and this is the bride
[1:34:06] the church goes through the tribulation
[1:34:08] the church goes to the white throne
[1:34:10] judgment the bride does not
[1:34:13] that's our great mystery that's the
[1:34:14] supernatural element that we see
[1:34:17] because you go to the denominations
[1:34:19] again and i'm not beating on them i'm
[1:34:20] just telling you what they believe
[1:34:23] they all believe we got to go to the
[1:34:25] white throne judgment ask one of them
[1:34:28] we all got to go that white throne
[1:34:30] judgment we're going to have seven years
[1:34:31] of tribulation we're going that's not
[1:34:33] true
[1:34:35] that's the supernatural element
[1:34:39] took a prophet
[1:34:41] to bring that out
[1:34:43] sixth mystery of the living cross the
[1:34:44] same yesterday today and forever
[1:34:47] and many places like that the seventh
[1:34:48] mystery is of god even christ as the
[1:34:50] incarnate fullness of the godhead
[1:34:53] embodied embodied in whom all divine
[1:34:57] wisdom
[1:34:58] not a second person
[1:35:00] not a second person of a trinity
[1:35:03] and godliness is restored
[1:35:06] to man oh you ain't worth nothing and i
[1:35:08] ain't worth nothing we can't make it
[1:35:11] loudly while you will
[1:35:14] you know what they're saying
[1:35:17] that their belief
[1:35:20] can't take them
[1:35:23] to where this is telling you in
[1:35:24] thessalonians
[1:35:26] we which are alive and remain so who cut
[1:35:28] them off their self
[1:35:30] but see the supernatural element shows
[1:35:32] us that there is a bride
[1:35:34] that's going to come to the end time and
[1:35:35] stand up
[1:35:37] and be the fullness of the godhead
[1:35:39] bodily not that he is we are
[1:35:43] and godliness is restored to man what is
[1:35:45] godliness there's one right here but
[1:35:47] this is all
[1:35:49] godliness
[1:35:51] oh man we can't do this
[1:35:55] no you can't
[1:35:57] but god can't if you'll let him
[1:35:59] the ninth mystery is the mystery of
[1:36:00] iniquity
[1:36:03] boy this is a big one now watch this
[1:36:06] they're living under that
[1:36:07] if you're not born again
[1:36:10] the mystery of iniquity has not been
[1:36:12] revealed to you
[1:36:13] because that's the man of sin
[1:36:15] and he's sitting in your temple
[1:36:18] he's sitting in those denominations and
[1:36:20] they're over there saying no we know who
[1:36:21] the man of sin is that's rome that's
[1:36:23] this person over here that's that's this
[1:36:25] great beast that's going to come up out
[1:36:26] of the ocean and that's just
[1:36:31] that's a mystery
[1:36:32] but the supernatural element tells us go
[1:36:34] read annoying ones at 10 times
[1:36:37] you read annoying ones at the end time
[1:36:38] there's your supernatural element
[1:36:40] everything's antichrist with the bride
[1:36:45] even foolish virgin
[1:36:48] sorry if you're if you're if you're a
[1:36:50] christ you're going in rapture
[1:36:52] if you're not you're not about okay just
[1:36:55] a few more minutes
[1:36:57] the ninth mystery is a mystery of
[1:36:58] iniquity now remember when the mystery
[1:37:00] of iniquity when was it unveiled or when
[1:37:02] was it when was it revealed under the
[1:37:05] first seal
[1:37:06] right under the first seal mystery of
[1:37:08] iniquity was revealed under the first
[1:37:10] deal when that first seal broke that
[1:37:12] white horse rider was not the holy ghost
[1:37:14] it was the antichrist that was the
[1:37:16] mystery of iniquity and it's a mystery
[1:37:17] but to me and you it's not a mystery
[1:37:19] anymore the mystery has become history
[1:37:22] because me and you know that underlying
[1:37:24] that supernatural element is if you're
[1:37:26] born again you're not in that system but
[1:37:29] if you're not born again that white
[1:37:31] horse rider is riding in you
[1:37:34] everybody all right
[1:37:36] the tenth mysteries of the seven stars
[1:37:38] of revelation it took a prophet of god
[1:37:40] we stood one day in a methodist church
[1:37:43] and somebody was asking us questions me
[1:37:45] and dad both there they asked me to do a
[1:37:48] men's breakfast fellowship for the his
[1:37:50] brother at the methodist church
[1:37:53] and one of the other young ministers
[1:37:55] said
[1:37:56] well what's this i heard that y'all were
[1:37:59] um
[1:38:00] you know that's a church a that you had
[1:38:02] wesley and lutheran wesleyan you know
[1:38:04] you might and then
[1:38:06] dad's brother said well that's just
[1:38:08] being a man follower
[1:38:12] i thought well you're standing in a
[1:38:14] methodist church
[1:38:17] that got their method of worship
[1:38:20] from one man
[1:38:23] john wesley
[1:38:24] one man
[1:38:26] and you don't believe in
[1:38:28] having a man lead you
[1:38:31] what he was getting at is he knew we you
[1:38:33] know brother branham was the prophet and
[1:38:34] he was our leader you know
[1:38:36] but it took a profit to tell us who
[1:38:38] those seven stars were
[1:38:40] and god confirmed it by writing it on
[1:38:42] the wall the same thing brother branham
[1:38:44] had preached
[1:38:46] so their mystery is they're seven
[1:38:47] messengers the the supernatural element
[1:38:49] is we know every one of them and the
[1:38:51] characteristics that's why i tell you
[1:38:53] these people that don't like
[1:38:55] sorry guys where y'all at in ohio
[1:39:00] some people don't believe the church age
[1:39:02] books worth reading now they don't but
[1:39:03] i'm telling you it's kind of prevalent
[1:39:05] in ohio because
[1:39:06] lee wales put up there and uh
[1:39:08] they said it was level's book and his
[1:39:10] wife's book and it's all this
[1:39:12] man i'm telling you you taking out a lot
[1:39:15] of the message of the hour if you don't
[1:39:16] read that church's book
[1:39:18] that church age book was vindicated by
[1:39:20] god
[1:39:21] through a prophet by writing it on the
[1:39:23] wall
[1:39:24] of the church ages and their
[1:39:26] characteristics and everything was right
[1:39:28] amen but it's something we all fight we
[1:39:30] we don't fight it so much down here but
[1:39:32] up north that's pretty prevalent because
[1:39:33] they they don't like brotherly bale
[1:39:35] to just be honest with you they didn't
[1:39:37] like him so they don't want to read his
[1:39:39] his book but that book to me
[1:39:42] is
[1:39:43] those seven mysteries of the stars and
[1:39:45] who the seven messengers was and their
[1:39:46] characteristics in the very city that
[1:39:48] they were told laodicea
[1:39:53] all the way every one of these had a
[1:39:54] characteristic all these cities
[1:39:56] remember laodicea was what destroyed by
[1:39:59] an earthquake
[1:40:01] they became very prominent a lot of
[1:40:03] money and all this stuff just like
[1:40:05] layout to see it become rich in the need
[1:40:06] of nothing don't tell me that wasn't god
[1:40:10] that was god that separated those ages
[1:40:12] through the messenger of the hour and he
[1:40:13] gave it to us and transposed it on a
[1:40:15] piece of faith i don't care if a woman
[1:40:17] wrote it down
[1:40:18] the prophet of god preached it
[1:40:20] that's enough for me
[1:40:22] the 11th mystery is the mystery babylon
[1:40:24] the prostitute
[1:40:26] well see that mystery is hell for me and
[1:40:28] you
[1:40:29] because the whole world don't know who
[1:40:30] she is
[1:40:32] we know who she is and we know where
[1:40:34] she's at
[1:40:35] and she's inside of you if you don't
[1:40:36] have the new birth
[1:40:38] see that we can bring it in closer now
[1:40:40] bring it in closer
[1:40:42] now what brother brown said that's some
[1:40:44] of the mysteries that this angel is
[1:40:45] supposed to wind up all the mystery all
[1:40:48] the mysteries of god and the other watch
[1:40:50] this
[1:40:51] may i say this with reverence and not
[1:40:53] referring to myself
[1:40:54] but referring to the angel of god
[1:40:57] he brings out these mysteries we'll
[1:40:59] close right here
[1:41:00] the serpent seed that's been a hidden
[1:41:02] mystery all through the years
[1:41:04] try that on people
[1:41:08] try that
[1:41:09] try that great mystery on people that it
[1:41:11] was sex in the garden and not an apple
[1:41:13] somebody eat
[1:41:14] my lord if it was an apple we need we
[1:41:16] need several billion apples
[1:41:20] if then women will put their clothes
[1:41:21] back on by eating by eating an apple
[1:41:24] okay
[1:41:26] the serpent seed has been hidden mystery
[1:41:28] all through the years
[1:41:30] look the gray straightened out not
[1:41:32] disgraced he's talking about marriage
[1:41:33] and divorce
[1:41:34] this is 1965.
[1:41:36] this is marriage and divorce the grace
[1:41:38] straightened out the grace not grace
[1:41:40] straightened out
[1:41:41] the grace straightened out not disgrace
[1:41:45] but real true grace we needed that grace
[1:41:48] that was a supernatural element the
[1:41:50] mystery was already in the bible
[1:41:52] you can't help but one wife
[1:41:54] your husband's got to be living
[1:41:58] right that's in the bible
[1:42:01] but there's an underlying supernatural
[1:42:02] element that if you don't get it we're
[1:42:04] all in trouble
[1:42:06] boy you get quiet when people start
[1:42:07] talking about marriage and divorce and
[1:42:09] stuff like that man i praise god i'm
[1:42:11] free
[1:42:13] i praise god god's freed me from that
[1:42:15] stuff
[1:42:15] i've accepted the grace not disgrace
[1:42:18] and doing it over and over again he said
[1:42:20] don't ever do it again
[1:42:22] we all need that grace
[1:42:24] if potential adultery is kissing a woman
[1:42:26] if potential adultery is blessing after
[1:42:28] a woman in your mind you've committed
[1:42:30] adultery with her
[1:42:31] we're dead and we have no hope
[1:42:34] but we get that grace right there
[1:42:36] not disgrace but real true grace no such
[1:42:40] a thing as an eternal burning hell try
[1:42:42] that on the denomination
[1:42:44] man they preach that
[1:42:46] you're going to burn eternally
[1:42:49] not going to happen folks
[1:42:51] you'll burn for millions of years
[1:42:53] but anything that was eternal this is
[1:42:55] how simple it is
[1:42:56] anything that was eternal never had a
[1:42:58] beginning or an end and hell was created
[1:43:01] all those mysteries the mystery of the
[1:43:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:05] without
[1:43:07] sensation
[1:43:12] without sensation
[1:43:14] but the person of christ performing in
[1:43:17] you the same works that he did
[1:43:21] the mystery of water baptism where the
[1:43:23] extreme trinitarianism has broughted in
[1:43:26] titles of father son holy ghost
[1:43:28] and the mystery of the godhead being
[1:43:30] fulfilled in the baptism in the name of
[1:43:32] jesus christ
[1:43:33] according to the book of revelations
[1:43:35] that the church in this time was to
[1:43:37] receive there is some of the mysteries
[1:43:40] the pillar of fire returning back amen
[1:43:43] that's the thing that's supposed to take
[1:43:44] place
[1:43:46] and we see it
[1:43:48] oh how we could go on naming the
[1:43:50] mysteries
[1:43:52] one right after the other the mystery of
[1:43:54] the seals the mystery of all this daniel
[1:43:57] 70 weeks the mysteries have been
[1:43:59] revealed and as brother brown said the
[1:44:01] mystery has become history
[1:44:06] the only great mystery is
[1:44:09] what paul said was
[1:44:11] christ in you
[1:44:13] the hope of glory let's stand to our
[1:44:15] feet
[1:44:16] that's a great mystery that we've got to
[1:44:17] understand well brother wade you just
[1:44:18] said he was in us yeah he's in us but
[1:44:20] we're not letting him have full control
[1:44:22] come on musicians
[1:44:25] we let him have full control that's the
[1:44:27] supernatural element
[1:44:32] not that we're just born again
[1:44:36] but we strive
[1:44:38] we push
[1:44:42] we pull
[1:44:45] we look at grace we read our bible we
[1:44:48] read it with different eyes than we read
[1:44:49] it when we were younger
[1:44:51] we read it with understanding we read it
[1:44:53] now with grace
[1:44:56] a great god that knew we would get in
[1:44:58] trouble
[1:44:59] if he put us in flesh
[1:45:02] but he did it because
[1:45:04] you had to make a choice
[1:45:08] in making a choice we decide where we go
[1:45:11] he doesn't decide where we go i just
[1:45:13] read you the bible or just quoted you
[1:45:14] where he said i wish that all people be
[1:45:16] saved
[1:45:17] i come to save every one of them but he
[1:45:18] knew when he got on that cross exactly
[1:45:20] who would be saved and who would not
[1:45:24] that's why i liked that song
[1:45:26] when i was on the cross he was on the
[1:45:28] cross i was on his mind
[1:45:30] he didn't have the whole world on his
[1:45:31] mind he was dying for his bride
[1:45:35] everybody that would accept him he only
[1:45:36] he knew so many would accept him and
[1:45:38] that's all
[1:45:40] and there's another mystery in there the
[1:45:41] mystery of predestination
[1:45:43] it's not just stamped and pulled you
[1:45:46] through a tube
[1:45:47] like some people say no you have a
[1:45:49] choice
[1:45:50] you're a free moral agent you're you're
[1:45:52] a free moral agent
[1:45:54] going up that statue of perfect man you
[1:45:56] can decide to stop anytime you want to
[1:45:58] or you can decide as paul said to go on
[1:46:00] to perfection not laying against the
[1:46:03] foundation of all these different
[1:46:04] doctrines that we've started on and
[1:46:07] that's good that we have
[1:46:08] newborn babies in christ i love to see
[1:46:10] them because man they're just so
[1:46:12] energetic
[1:46:13] but as you continue on the journey you
[1:46:14] get a little more weary and you get a
[1:46:16] little more worn you see people falling
[1:46:18] away
[1:46:20] the devil starts putting more in your
[1:46:21] mind
[1:46:22] he's not going to quit
[1:46:25] he's never going to let up
[1:46:27] but god didn't either and you know what
[1:46:28] he put provision for you to make it
[1:46:31] or he couldn't have said what he said in
[1:46:33] the bible he made provisions so
[1:46:35] somebody's got to get in that provision
[1:46:36] and make that provision and make it he
[1:46:38] has provided whatever we need to make it
[1:46:41] we just gotta decide whether we want it
[1:46:42] or not let's go ahead
[1:46:44] spread your wings little eagles
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:05] you were born
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:39] [Laughter]
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:48] you weren't born for another mystery you
[1:47:51] were born from this mystery
[1:47:53] you were born for this revelation in the
[1:47:55] end
[1:47:57] don't let trials get you down or drive
[1:47:59] your spirit
[1:48:02] to the ground
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:12] one more time
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:44] to the ground
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:55] have you ever watched an eagle you know
[1:48:56] they're so confident
[1:48:59] they'll just pop up on a little a little
[1:49:01] ledge and they'll just sit there
[1:49:04] and they'll look around every once in a
[1:49:06] while
[1:49:08] and you'll see them kind of
[1:49:10] they're getting them digested
[1:49:12] they're in their feathers they're going
[1:49:14] through justification sanctification
[1:49:17] baptism of the holy ghost and then they
[1:49:19] look out there and say well i got to go
[1:49:20] a little higher i'm going to have to
[1:49:22] want to twist them out just a little bit
[1:49:23] more to virtue knowledge
[1:49:26] temperance patience
[1:49:27] godliness and you look around you say oh
[1:49:32] about two miles down through there
[1:49:33] there's some fresh meat
[1:49:36] i
[1:49:37] eagles don't drink milk
[1:49:40] eagles have never drank milk
[1:49:42] they eat meat
[1:49:44] even from the baby they're the only
[1:49:45] animal that's in the the
[1:49:48] you know my linox man and eagle that
[1:49:50] doesn't start off drinking milk all the
[1:49:52] others drink milk except the eagle but
[1:49:55] what does mother eagle do she doesn't
[1:49:57] take and just force everything down your
[1:49:58] throat
[1:50:02] oh he could take a rabbit
[1:50:05] and force it down it killed the child it
[1:50:08] killed a little eagle
[1:50:09] what's mama eagle do
[1:50:11] pulls off a little at a time
[1:50:14] gets a message ready for sunday and
[1:50:15] wednesday
[1:50:17] softens it up a little bit
[1:50:19] and says all right open up
[1:50:22] and she drops it down in
[1:50:24] and that little eagle gets bigger
[1:50:26] and bigger
[1:50:28] to ju through
[1:50:29] virtue knowledge temperance you know
[1:50:32] he's got wings all the time
[1:50:34] he didn't grow a set of wings after he
[1:50:36] was a baby after he you know came out of
[1:50:38] the shell
[1:50:39] no he always had the wings he just
[1:50:41] didn't know what to do with them
[1:50:43] i mean he said you watch them they'll
[1:50:45] sit there and they'll do this
[1:50:47] they're like man this dude's never gonna
[1:50:49] fly
[1:50:50] but what happens is that mama eagle
[1:50:54] she takes them on test flights
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:51:00] they hang on to mama
[1:51:02] for a little while
[1:51:04] they hang on to mama and she flies
[1:51:06] around and says well you can do this
[1:51:09] takes him back to the nest and then what
[1:51:11] did she do she don't just sit there and
[1:51:12] go i think i'll pad this just a little
[1:51:15] bit more
[1:51:16] no no no
[1:51:18] she builds it remember she builds it out
[1:51:19] of thorns
[1:51:21] but she pads it with her
[1:51:23] real plush feathers she pulls the
[1:51:26] feathers out and puts it in pulls the
[1:51:27] feathers out and puts those feathers in
[1:51:30] it becomes real soft
[1:51:33] when you're just a baby in christ
[1:51:35] god puts you on that soft pillow
[1:51:39] now look the thorns are still there
[1:51:42] the thorns are always there
[1:51:44] but she puts a layer on top of that
[1:51:47] to soften
[1:51:49] and you can be comfortable
[1:51:51] when you start through your journey
[1:51:55] god hears your voice
[1:51:57] and your little child and he gives you
[1:51:59] things that now sometimes you can't find
[1:52:01] god
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:04] but what happens is sister rebecca every
[1:52:06] once in a while
[1:52:07] the mama is going to take some feathers
[1:52:09] out
[1:52:11] she's not doing anything to the thorns
[1:52:13] they're still there
[1:52:15] the kids are there but she knows by
[1:52:17] taking them out on their test flight
[1:52:20] they're ready to go
[1:52:21] i don't want you sitting in my house
[1:52:24] anymore
[1:52:26] my nest
[1:52:27] that's why we want our kids to leave
[1:52:29] when they get a certain age
[1:52:31] hey man
[1:52:33] not y'all we're talking about y'all
[1:52:37] but what'd she do she said all right she
[1:52:38] says
[1:52:39] i think they've had got some virtue
[1:52:42] and some knowledge they've got some
[1:52:44] temperance now
[1:52:46] they got some patience and the little
[1:52:48] old bird comes back and kind of goes
[1:52:51] um
[1:52:52] i definitely ain't sitting down
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:56] if he didn't get a he'd get a crude
[1:52:58] awakening
[1:52:59] all right
[1:53:00] but what's mama say mama says
[1:53:03] time to go
[1:53:04] time for you to go eat some meat time
[1:53:07] for you to go make you a nest
[1:53:09] time for you to get the holy ghost and
[1:53:12] get out there and show who you are
[1:53:16] show who you are
[1:53:17] then the eagles man i love to watch we
[1:53:19] went to alaska several years ago and
[1:53:21] they're everywhere up there man they're
[1:53:22] just sitting on every land they're just
[1:53:24] sitting there they're doing this a big
[1:53:26] old white head looking around like this
[1:53:28] they're observing everything and all of
[1:53:29] a sudden what happens is they kind of
[1:53:32] do this brother louise they can't do
[1:53:34] this and they turn their wings
[1:53:36] and then buddy when they set them
[1:53:39] when they set them wings
[1:53:41] they're gone they don't have to flop
[1:53:44] they're watching that wind
[1:53:46] they're watching that current
[1:53:48] and they can see it bearing weekend
[1:53:49] they'll either watch the leaves or
[1:53:50] something because we were watching them
[1:53:52] they would pitch they'd pitch off of
[1:53:54] those limbs and down through we were we
[1:53:57] were whale watching and they'd come in
[1:53:58] through that
[1:53:59] through that valley and they'd
[1:54:01] never even do this
[1:54:04] just like this
[1:54:05] down if you want to pick up a fish
[1:54:07] they'd pick a fish up and then they'd
[1:54:08] have to do their arms to get back up but
[1:54:10] it was effortless
