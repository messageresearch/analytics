[0:00] we got a few hours they go to Danny see
[0:07] remember Bob they're in mobile riding
[0:12] gave your teaching trench go for the
[0:14] ones that are not here boy granite not
[0:16] here like I say it with me
[0:19] catch the lathe my mouse will play being
[0:25] way too look we got to hate sister
[0:29] Barbara cheers brother brother than
[0:33] reality sentences and the kids were
[0:43] spread in his abdomen so they
[0:46] recommended hospice and Cheryl Excel and
[0:51] then remember the Dale family of the
[0:53] Luallen family and Eddie's of one of the
[0:56] older sisters are still alive passed
[0:58] away last night
[1:00] we'll have to be at a funeral or viewing
[1:02] cup of ACE it just keeps all be fresh so
[1:04] anyway good how sister Irene Willis from
[1:06] the Philippines brother burn my Miley
[1:11] got her over here the United States and
[1:12] she's never found so far so far yeah
[1:16] okay she's she just wait lady I said it
[1:22] online
[1:23] we've got a big trip let every soul be
[1:27] subject to the higher power now we're
[1:29] still in the book of Romans and we
[1:30] didn't get very far last Sunday but
[1:33] maybe we'll get this chapter 13 finished
[1:35] then every soul be subject to the higher
[1:38] powers for there is no power but of God
[1:40] that's what we're talking about that
[1:41] Sunday a little bit there is no power
[1:44] but of God there's only
[1:46] our segment only has permitted power God
[1:50] permits Satan to working around because
[1:53] God can't go against his word and it
[1:55] made Satan The Anointed chair right he's
[1:58] the one making that so he's anointed and
[2:02] he's a cherub and he was the right-hand
[2:04] man of God before he about says iniquity
[2:08] was found in his heart so doc can't take
[2:11] that away from him but he's gonna get
[2:14] rid of him the gun yes and but there is
[2:19] only one power and as of God right the
[2:22] powers that be are ordained of God so
[2:24] what's Paul telling us there is no power
[2:26] of God so there's no power but God hears
[2:31] to be here's the power all right then
[2:34] underneath that he's got all these
[2:36] different levels everybody got that
[2:38] because the powers that be are ordained
[2:42] of God so any other power you talk about
[2:44] is ordained of God even Satan's power
[2:47] yes it's ordained of God from the
[2:50] grounds they wanted to drive us to
[2:52] Christ and then because he knew we would
[2:55] fall us think a little bit yesterday you
[2:58] know he didn't make this fall but he
[2:59] knew we'd thought when he put out a man
[3:01] even flesh he knew that fleshly part was
[3:03] would overtake Adam and Eve and they
[3:08] went against their whole inside being
[3:10] they went against everything they'd seen
[3:12] before and even in watching the animals
[3:19] procreate and you would think it out of
[3:22] an even get an idea before even Satan
[3:25] come in you know but they brother man
[3:27] said they were covered with the Holy
[3:28] Ghost Baylor next that's what we're
[3:30] going back to we're not going back to
[3:32] that they had a Holy Ghost veil and how
[3:35] many clothes on but you got to remember
[3:36] once we come through sin and get you dip
[3:38] down into flesh and we come back up out
[3:40] of the flesh and go into the into the
[3:43] future home or even into the body change
[3:45] he's going to change these bodies that
[3:47] we got so he's put white robes on us you
[3:49] know
[3:49] so that we can have that holy ghost veil
[3:51] back on this that's why I was thinking
[3:54] about this do you was mention of them
[3:56] about more well about a religion that I
[3:59] know very well killed they had two girls
[4:01] that work with me that were both devout
[4:03] Mormons I'm going to say but they wore
[4:06] an undergarment and that was their
[4:09] coverage that was our Holy Ghost that
[4:10] was their they wore a complete lucky
[4:13] Union too we have gold Union suits you
[4:15] know they'd wear that and that was there
[4:17] covering underneath them to keep them
[4:20] pure well it didn't work
[4:25] the only power debate is the one you
[4:28] can't see and that's the one in the Holy
[4:29] Ghost that's the one to devil not just
[4:32] cover - right here we want it to go all
[4:34] the way in and work its way back out
[4:36] right so the powers that be are ordained
[4:39] of God even look therefore whosoever
[4:42] therefore resisteth the power resisteth
[4:45] the ordinance of God Miller words the
[4:49] Bible said if you can't take correction
[4:50] you're what a bastard child so when the
[4:52] Lord's you're over here with with the
[4:55] Satan group right cuz two groups of
[4:58] people brother brown said you're either
[4:59] born again okay you're either childhood
[5:02] dog little put child
[5:03] you're either childhood dog or your
[5:06] child of the devil there's no in-between
[5:08] there's no tweeners in him come on
[5:11] brother Dennis getting with a fire
[5:14] follow me but this is where were
[5:18] therefore resisteth the power resisteth
[5:19] the ordinance of God now that's what we
[5:21] did in our life as a center we resisted
[5:26] the very thing that that would help us
[5:29] man we resisted that power now that
[5:33] didn't make God's power in last because
[5:37] you're still a free moral agent even
[5:39] Satan everybody has a free moral agent
[5:42] let's don't get into this but if some
[5:44] thought to think about even an angel has
[5:46] a free moral agency yes though they're
[5:48] not humans because remember
[5:50] Satan's told of a lie and a third of the
[5:54] of the third of the of the Angels body
[5:58] and that was the Fallen Angels but now
[6:01] part I'm dead
[6:02] you've got that person that person a
[6:04] person that angel that's with you I
[6:06] brother day opens on that brother never
[6:08] said God gives us all an angel
[6:09] that's not fallen angel that Angels have
[6:12] come straight from God to protect the
[6:15] children of righteousness to protect us
[6:18] through life other than that boy look
[6:23] what look at how we were we didn't know
[6:25] it but we had an angel it's like brother
[6:27] branham always said it's not some little
[6:29] spot or some eternal something inside of
[6:32] you
[6:32] it was an anointing to me it's an
[6:34] anointing that was around you even when
[6:36] you were sin remember brother Brown said
[6:38] you know you bet Center you do something
[6:39] wrong you get them convicted a little
[6:41] more than the other guy the other guy
[6:43] was just ran up here and corrals and all
[6:45] that didn't bother him ain't still
[6:46] doesn't bother but you and I they always
[6:49] run loose will tell you even everybody
[6:52] that walked in the flesh for a while
[6:54] there was always something that says hey
[6:57] that's not right there was always some
[6:58] little check you know well to me that
[7:00] was that anointing maybe not just a
[7:02] there's not a I don't think I don't know
[7:04] if there's an angel you know creeping
[7:05] around behind you could be I don't know
[7:08] good thing but there's an anointing
[7:11] around you at birth because if God knew
[7:14] you were gonna receive the new birth in
[7:15] a certain time you had to make it to
[7:18] that spot and don't you think that guy
[7:20] out there knows it and he's gonna try to
[7:22] stop you he's what it's creeper me yes
[7:29] like by the way says that when he leaves
[7:34] he said I'm gonna do something that the
[7:35] devil will never do I'm gonna leave you
[7:42] so that's what and that's true
[7:45] they sayings right there all the time
[7:46] but we have that fire around us like I
[7:49] was preaching on the other day we have
[7:50] that fire around us that anointing that
[7:53] keeps us now you don't make us do right
[7:56] no that's right
[7:58] because that will take away your free
[8:00] moral agency that will take away your
[8:01] God ship your your God your year God's
[8:04] right it will take that away so but now
[8:07] they can influence you because weather
[8:09] man said Satan
[8:10] Shayne's him for his power workmen
[8:13] anoint you and tries to what diverts you
[8:16] into another direction but if you're a
[8:18] child I'm your gonna come at God strong
[8:20] use a child you're gonna come so they he
[8:23] does put a protection around you then
[8:25] when that protection goes inside to you
[8:27] as the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't
[8:29] then you walk catch the person ye are
[8:32] God's still right you just become a
[8:36] child of God not a child of the devil
[8:38] because you were you were you were
[8:42] potentially a child of God when you were
[8:45] doing those wrong things but you weren't
[8:46] a child of God when you were doing them
[8:47] called the child of God won't do that so
[8:49] you got to keep that separate that Satan
[8:52] anointed you but you had an anointing
[8:55] Colette's was fighting brother Brown
[8:57] says remember the greatest battle ever
[8:58] fought in your mind it's not something
[9:00] you can see warfare futile bigger guns
[9:03] that's what man Superman has perverted
[9:05] that into trying to build a bigger gun a
[9:07] bigger bomb a bigger something to
[9:09] destroy more people when when when they
[9:13] see them two prophets over there when we
[9:15] leave with him to prophets go to Israel
[9:17] when empty profits go to Israel and
[9:20] they're standing there just to human
[9:22] mortal man and they're calling fire
[9:24] they're calling earthquakes they're
[9:25] calling this they're calling that all
[9:27] now like we're getting ready to talk in
[9:28] the sixth seal when they bring all that
[9:31] man the people ain't going to understand
[9:32] these cuz they don't want to know
[9:34] where's your weapon you know where's
[9:36] this secret lab that you've you've
[9:39] created this power that you can call you
[9:42] know fire down and just kill thousand
[9:44] the people that attack them well it
[9:46] comes from within because the Bible says
[9:48] fire proceeds from their mouth
[9:50] literal fire but what being able to call
[9:53] and there's a power behind them because
[9:56] see they're anointed to do a job they're
[9:58] not anointing to be the Bride of Christ
[10:00] you and I are anointed to be the Bride
[10:02] of Christ anybody change take a
[10:03] resurrection take a resurrection body
[10:05] change rapture yeah right they have an
[10:09] anointing the two properties will get
[10:11] into the 60s something a little bit more
[10:13] of their anointing to do one thing call
[10:16] 144,000 out now ever how it happens we
[10:19] know what happens that they you know
[10:21] they keep all these nations are want to
[10:24] kill them you know like I said they've
[10:25] all got these spies that it won't kill
[10:27] these two guys and I'm gonna be able to
[10:29] kill them till the 1260 days is over
[10:31] they'll have that anointing to me it's
[10:34] the same anointing and that's something
[10:35] we need to get into maybe a little bit
[10:37] later we come about a morning
[10:38] maybe we talk about later in the seventh
[10:40] seal because I believe that's what is me
[10:41] there was anointing on Jesus where he
[10:44] couldn't die he didn't become God on the
[10:47] River Jordan the Holy Ghost didn't come
[10:49] inside I mean the Bible said it came on
[10:51] me what for his three and a half year
[10:54] message ministry where they would try to
[10:57] tell anything will try to throw him off
[10:59] the cliff and the Bible says he walked
[11:00] through right through the crowd same
[11:03] waves got even and Elijah Elijah
[11:06] standing there going there's more for us
[11:08] than they are against us and days us
[11:10] going one two one two one two then he
[11:13] said o open my service eyes and then he
[11:16] saw what chariots of fire
[11:18] angels way more than thou army was right
[11:21] well that see that's what it wasn't a
[11:23] lot Elisha was in that that those angels
[11:26] were in that other dimension
[11:28] making sure Elijah he finished his job
[11:31] yeah same way with Jesus because
[11:33] remember even when Jesus went into the
[11:35] went into the forty days into the
[11:37] wilderness the Bible said that angels
[11:41] ministered to him then he said when he
[11:43] went in the garden against them when
[11:44] they said angels ministered to him right
[11:47] comforted him right because in the
[11:50] Garden of Gethsemane that power left him
[11:52] that 1260 days of the mastery of Jesus
[11:57] left him so he could die so you couldn't
[11:59] die well that will an anointing on it
[12:01] so that's what I see if we come to that
[12:05] anointed that same anointing which lists
[12:07] the seals that's what he is this he was
[12:09] to sail a sail preaching did that dream
[12:12] have your message that he preached came
[12:15] over to a little profit in the end time
[12:17] brother Brown his 1260 days of preaching
[12:20] from 1962 basically was 1965 right that
[12:24] Nordine lifted off of him and he had to
[12:27] pass away because he was prophetic he
[12:29] prophesied of a group of people to come
[12:30] but now you and I are gonna have that
[12:32] anointing I believe if we come to that
[12:34] place of the seventh seal we're going to
[12:36] have that power that anointing that we
[12:38] can't die and we're just gonna go right
[12:40] into into a body change right
[12:42] incorrectly we would you're alive in
[12:44] your mind right shall not prevent or
[12:46] hinder those with your sleep yeah but
[12:49] you see once the seals start opening to
[12:51] you you can put it in every scripture
[12:53] that's my brother Munson Bobby teff
[12:55] brand-new book that's why I said if you
[12:57] don't see Christ in every person well
[12:58] who is the seventh seal Christ is the
[13:00] seal so you must see Christ even in here
[13:04] yes right whosoever they're resistant to
[13:07] power resistance the ornaments who've
[13:08] done or next is ordination or ordained
[13:12] you are ordained for something your
[13:16] brother I said one guy ordained for one
[13:17] sermon John the Baptist ordained for
[13:20] just a little bit in short time six
[13:21] months preaching no miracles but he was
[13:24] ordained to introduce Christ Jesus man
[13:26] all right in the flesh and they that
[13:31] resist shall receive to themselves
[13:33] damnation all right so if you stay on
[13:38] here you know what you're gonna get but
[13:39] if you come over here because what Paul
[13:42] he says for rulers are not a terror to
[13:45] good works rulers
[13:49] but to evil well now then not be afraid
[13:54] of the power see where we're supposed to
[13:59] have a reverent fear of God but we're
[14:01] not supposed to fear God I love the
[14:02] Bible says fear God you're not supposed
[14:04] to fear Him in the way we think feelings
[14:06] man okay there's a holy fear and
[14:09] reverence that we know he's up here and
[14:11] he's the Creator okay that's this man's
[14:13] problem
[14:14] he thinks he can supersede yourself up
[14:16] to here right right but now when the
[14:20] very man that standed though watch this
[14:23] when the very man they said it takes
[14:24] this group of people and puts us right
[14:26] here that's right
[14:29] now you put him about I ain't putting
[14:31] somebody right I put him in that's right
[14:34] and put us above him we're not we can't
[14:37] be above the Creator right
[14:39] but when he says we are gods when he
[14:41] says work God made manifest in another
[14:44] form called a bribe that's what he said
[14:46] then the Creator can do whatever he
[14:47] wants to yeah so we are ordained not to
[14:51] damnation we're not to rule with terror
[14:56] well now then not be afraid of the power
[15:00] you've seen that rulers really put fear
[15:03] in the people and keep you watch
[15:05] suppressed say a ruler will do that
[15:07] Satan that's what he does he tries to
[15:09] keep then everybody down here God's
[15:11] trying to get everybody back up every
[15:13] day
[15:13] hey man God's trying to get us back up
[15:17] to where he is a true ruler will do that
[15:20] all right you know how did he do that he
[15:24] came and died so that we could get back
[15:25] up there all right do that which is good
[15:30] and thou shalt have praise of the same
[15:34] in other words
[15:39] what for he is the minister of God to
[15:43] thee for good right in other words
[15:46] whoever King today
[15:48] excuse me he that which is good I shall
[15:50] have praise of the same for he is the
[15:53] minister of God now who's the minister
[15:55] of God not Sam Dale it's not Vernon
[16:00] Manhattan it's got its name this God God
[16:04] is gonna preach it because this man gets
[16:07] up and preaches it's just money that's
[16:10] right but there's an ordination or there
[16:13] is a there is a way for us to get back
[16:17] in it's called a ministry a fivefold
[16:21] ministry to get us perfected this brings
[16:24] us back to here so for he is the
[16:27] minister of God to thee for good that's
[16:30] my brother Brown said if your pastors
[16:32] are off the word that's the only reason
[16:34] you leave now cuz you got a bad song
[16:35] service not called the personal side you
[16:37] smell bad not because you don't like
[16:38] this by the other no it's joke because
[16:40] of the word if he's preaching the word
[16:42] you need to focus on the word cuz that's
[16:45] what's gonna change your body not all
[16:46] this other frivolous stuff that to me
[16:48] that's your privilege junk that you know
[16:51] what that is that's not God
[16:56] yes God is not the author of confusion
[16:57] so let's divide this there is no
[16:59] confusion on this side of the line
[17:01] there's total confusion on this side
[17:03] along so if there is any confusion is
[17:06] over here on this side right but if thou
[17:09] do that which is evil be afraid for he
[17:12] beareth not the sword in vain for he
[17:15] using the minister of god it didn't say
[17:18] a SSD she was talking about the Holy
[17:20] Ghost
[17:21] see you can say a minister says the
[17:24] minister and a revenger to execute wrath
[17:27] upon him that doeth evil now in other
[17:30] words you continue to do this you're
[17:33] gonna get that's what I say you get an
[17:35] inheritance one way the other you got an
[17:38] inheritance on this side like fire you
[17:41] got it here it is on this side keep your
[17:43] home eternal life and this is totally
[17:48] eternal separation I didn't say eternal
[17:50] life I save you
[17:51] separation of once you get on this side
[17:53] you can't go back get your seal well you
[17:58] can't go back all right
[18:00] a remainder to ask you to rap on him to
[18:01] do is evil wherefore ye must needs to be
[18:05] subject not only for wrath but also for
[18:09] conscience sake in other words I've seen
[18:15] churches split and I've seen problems in
[18:17] other churches where a person sits in
[18:20] the congregation and thinks they can do
[18:22] a better job than they got standing up
[18:23] in the pulpit that's where you get split
[18:26] yeah you subjected yourself not to the
[18:31] higher power you subjected yourself to
[18:33] this guy right now it's the now listen
[18:39] though if the preachers in pulpit
[18:40] preaching polygamy in two lords and
[18:44] Trinity doctrine then you're supposed to
[18:48] leave him and do what you do but if the
[18:51] man's preaching the Word of God in the
[18:52] pulpit every Sunday every Wednesday if
[18:54] he's preaching the word line-by-line
[18:56] then if there's somebody in them in the
[18:59] congregation that thinks they do a
[19:01] better job see that's where you get and
[19:03] that really comes up complication well I
[19:06] think I do bear jovem he does so I just
[19:08] don't we'll take some people humble go
[19:09] start me in the church go back to the
[19:13] question is he preaching the truth he's
[19:17] preaching the truth why do you think you
[19:18] preach it burn he can let's see we have
[19:21] to be 70 and listen that's your problem
[19:24] in mine we hate authority of the human
[19:26] being come on they don't like Authority
[19:29] as human being we do not like somebody
[19:32] to tell us what to do you know who that
[19:35] is
[19:35] he didn't like for God to tell you what
[19:38] to do Yeah right they did that's why I
[19:41] said iniquity was found in what he
[19:43] thought he could supersede yourself and
[19:45] get somehow get up here cuz state
[19:47] remember Satan likes numbers he likes
[19:49] together
[19:50] millions together and thinks by groups
[19:52] of people he can he can overtake stuff
[19:55] then you got two prophets walk out with
[19:58] seven billion people in the world who
[19:59] prophets walk out of knowing where the
[20:01] Holy Ghost to do
[20:02] to do a job and they can't touch him for
[20:04] 1260 days they say my knowing is gonna
[20:07] be on them then when I'm morning lift
[20:08] off of them they're gonna be killed then
[20:10] they're gonna take a rapture so come on
[20:12] you kind of get the trend you'll not die
[20:16] a day before God's on you if you're a
[20:20] Christian
[20:20] the day before God finished with you are
[20:22] they after you'll go today God is
[20:27] finished with you on this earth and if
[20:30] you're a Christian and the child of God
[20:31] you should say I don't wanna stay enough
[20:34] no no extra right well there is some
[20:38] that are dying not to see that there's
[20:40] someone we must have that mentality that
[20:42] there is somebody that's not going to
[20:45] die somebody duck death will be
[20:47] conquered on this side in this dimension
[20:49] that's gonna be conquered and when it is
[20:52] then it's going to bring all the other
[20:54] ones out of the grave all right well
[20:59] we've run into a ran into a doctrine in
[21:01] the Philippines things
[21:02] there's about that close to the truth
[21:06] Nicaragua sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[21:08] Nicaragua baits that close to the truth
[21:11] but that's they and they literally going
[21:13] to walk out to the grave and call the
[21:14] person in the you know the no words the
[21:17] grounds gonna pop open and the person's
[21:18] gonna raise up ugly they're gonna
[21:20] physically raise the data I don't think
[21:23] that's true because it's got to be all
[21:24] secret got to be a secret coming this
[21:28] this is a secret coming across that
[21:29] nobody in the world knows that people
[21:31] dismiss people that have the truth of
[21:34] this message let me say that people have
[21:36] the truth of this message I just believe
[21:39] one day we'll be preaching the true Word
[21:40] of God and anointing is gonna fall and
[21:43] we're not gonna I don't think physically
[21:45] go out to the grave and scream and
[21:47] holler we'll just be coming to a place
[21:49] we'll come to a position to where
[21:53] they'll just start walking among us and
[21:55] they'll just come walking in and and
[21:58] we'll recognize them and I don't think
[22:00] Robert Tatum which was a deacon here and
[22:03] a longtime member here I don't think
[22:05] he's gonna go too
[22:08] making and walking that church no he's
[22:11] gonna come among the people that you
[22:12] know the people that you know are gonna
[22:15] come among the people that have been
[22:16] known while they were alive yeah and
[22:17] that to me that's to me that's a
[22:19] wonderful thing kolima brother Graham
[22:21] the angel remember in the when he went
[22:24] to the time he said you be gathered with
[22:26] your people Paul's not gonna be going
[22:28] with brother Browns people Paul's
[22:29] gathered with his people in a dimension
[22:32] inside of dimensions and we've already
[22:34] studied that with you there's Paul did
[22:37] not see brother Branham in brother Brown
[22:38] did not see Paul cuz he said it did Paul
[22:40] make it now if he was if I was looking
[22:42] at broker in another dimension boat-car
[22:45] walls up would be brother Colonel make
[22:47] it no let's don't think that way he
[22:49] didn't see Paul calls together with his
[22:51] people Iranians his going with his
[22:52] people because how did those people that
[22:56] brother branham song get into that
[22:57] dimension the angel told him your
[23:00] ministry your message these are your
[23:02] people
[23:02] all Browns no converts all right so they
[23:05] will convert to William Browns message
[23:09] sorry to Jesus Christ's message drew
[23:12] William Randall but it was in that slide
[23:14] that everybody did we come into the
[23:16] higher power see that's where people try
[23:20] to shoot proceeding and get in front of
[23:23] brother Brown well he's young he only
[23:25] knew this now we know more no he was a
[23:28] seventh angel prophet major problem Amen
[23:31] God garden he'll have a one shot down
[23:34] right down nobody in between but see
[23:37] that's the how are you let he accepted
[23:39] Jesus Christ is the head I don't mind
[23:44] calling it hard because Jesus Christ is
[23:46] the head and it must not be a problem
[23:50] with it even in the future home because
[23:53] the Bible says Kings will come in well
[23:55] now you got to be a kingdom you don't
[23:56] have a kingdom to be a king
[24:00] keys are gonna come in to the city and
[24:02] get to leave off the tree and go back
[24:04] well now who's you gonna take it back to
[24:06] the people that he had
[24:08] Oh chip over now how that is I don't
[24:11] know because I got one thing for sure I
[24:13] heard Monty put us in the city and we
[24:15] got one bride in one bridegroom and
[24:18] 144,000 to work around in the city but
[24:22] this just gonna be us in that City which
[24:24] is the wonderful thing so then we know
[24:26] who our head just like we know you know
[24:28] well that we're married to Christ and
[24:30] Christ as their head
[24:31] he's our hierarchy but now what he's
[24:35] done is brother Brian even said that we
[24:39] become deity yes but that's what God
[24:43] said mm-hmm what he would become did all
[24:47] right we we are God on this earth
[24:48] because remember thank God and the Holy
[24:52] Ghost you got inside of you
[24:54] it's not two different people same
[24:55] person amen
[24:57] it's just in a different place right all
[25:01] right well that would not even get all
[25:05] right okay wherefore you must needs be
[25:08] subject we've got to be subject Paul
[25:13] says while subject yourself to your
[25:15] husband's now not totalitarian rulership
[25:20] you do this are you going to get one of
[25:22] these you know well you know what the
[25:24] Bible says the way you treat your wife
[25:26] the way God treats you so God's gonna be
[25:28] doing this to you if you don't be
[25:29] careful so treat your wife right treat
[25:32] your husband right and everything you'll
[25:33] be good all right hey man yeah wherefore
[25:38] you must need to be subject not only for
[25:41] wrath but also for conscience sake let
[25:43] me just move a point in here
[25:45] Rebecca was coming my Gary being gone
[25:47] for four years she has a head her heads
[25:49] Christ
[25:50] see watch Paul Paul says I would that
[25:52] you not even marry why because come on
[25:55] let's be honest as human we got God our
[25:58] husband and then the bride natural
[26:02] natural Jim is 72 me and I'm certain to
[26:06] cry all right
[26:08] but Paul says if you won't get married
[26:11] then you're subject to God
[26:13] so that's your subject to go so it
[26:16] leaves it to where that a single wife or
[26:19] even a wife they don't have one husband
[26:21] this this server the message your head
[26:23] shift Christ and policy that would be
[26:26] good if you could do that but now you
[26:28] got to be careful because we're gonna
[26:30] read this if we ever get down to the
[26:31] very bottom says but put you on the Lord
[26:33] Jesus and make not provision for the
[26:35] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof
[26:38] because that's the problem with some
[26:40] certain church not letting their priests
[26:43] married yeah they get troubled little
[26:46] boys why because of the lust of the
[26:48] flesh
[26:48] there's no holy ghost in any person hey
[26:51] alright with that I'm you ready let's
[26:53] just be honest we were put here
[26:55] procreate
[26:56] we were put here with that sensuality
[26:59] part but a lot of times we you have to
[27:03] be careful there's a fine line but wait
[27:08] it's not me
[27:10] do what it's not the GP be either after
[27:13] the husband dies the other words does
[27:15] not God the pastor then the bride no no
[27:18] if guys you you're right there with you
[27:20] know you're at the but sometimes some
[27:22] people will be like well you know your
[27:24] husband is dead I'm your pastor so I'm
[27:26] your heads now and then yeah you have to
[27:28] be careful laugh yeah cuz a lot of times
[27:30] didn't you hear about a year later that
[27:32] preachers got about four of them in the
[27:34] congregation and they're not just
[27:36] spiritual heavy anymore you understand
[27:38] what I mean
[27:38] yeah okay so we have to be careful keep
[27:41] it separate pastor is your spiritual
[27:44] head sure okay but but he's not to be
[27:47] he's not the superseded step between you
[27:50] and crime right if he's speaking their
[27:53] this Christ talking to you so you know
[27:54] you go back to that but that's true we
[27:58] have to watch even Paul Paul was not
[28:00] married okay gonna have a wife need have
[28:02] children but he knew the lust of the
[28:04] flesh company was tell people just like
[28:06] the down here the bottom
[28:08] listen it's better to marry than to burn
[28:10] but if you can stay single being eunuch
[28:13] to Christ and stay single
[28:14] why because you can give more time to
[28:18] God I mean really let's be truthful if
[28:21] you got a husband we all we all have
[28:23] needs wash my clothes
[28:25] do always right
[28:27] but if you don't have all that you just
[28:28] do your thing and then you know then you
[28:30] then you can pray that's one bit that I
[28:33] believe brother Brown knew that that's
[28:35] why a lot of times he said my success is
[28:37] some little or some sister getting in
[28:39] the closet bragging that he sent that so
[28:42] God must have showed him that they were
[28:44] sincere and praying for the meetin and
[28:47] knock all this other stuff but then I go
[28:50] back to John Wesley's mama
[28:52] Johnny chose West's mother had 13 kids
[28:55] she raised two at least to God the ones
[28:58] out of it and she had time to read the
[29:00] Bible to them and everything else and
[29:01] she watched thirteen thirty dollars well
[29:03] got the thing but you were 13 pegs close
[29:06] she didn't have a maytag she was out
[29:10] there doing this on the washboard you
[29:12] know and I'm sure the kids were like all
[29:15] of us they weren't very clean yeah they
[29:17] get muddy clothes they keep the clean
[29:19] you don't say I won't answer you make
[29:21] time for what you may come for for this
[29:23] cause pay ye tribute also so you must
[29:27] pay tribute
[29:28] we know that brother Dale is our pastor
[29:30] so there's really no there's no question
[29:33] right and his head is Christ and I've
[29:37] had this cross when it comes to the
[29:39] spiritual part so we have no problem
[29:41] with that it's when you supersede one
[29:43] brother branham say when we get in our
[29:45] position know your position if you're a
[29:48] finger be the best finger you can be you
[29:50] know if you if you go to if you can't
[29:52] preach and you can't do these things you
[29:54] can at least an appealing breath all
[29:56] right worship and bring the spirit week
[29:59] and when you come not well bring the
[30:02] whole experience they don't bring the
[30:03] spirit week for their thoughts ministers
[30:07] attending continually upon this very
[30:09] thing render therefore to all their dues
[30:13] tribute to whom tribute is due custom to
[30:17] whom custom and what's he telling he's
[30:19] telling them you got a pastor believe in
[30:22] you pastor believe in a fivefold
[30:23] ministry fear to whom fear honor to new
[30:26] honor it's pretty simple oh no man
[30:29] anything all right but to love one
[30:32] another
[30:33] for he that loveth another hath
[30:35] fulfilled the law for their staff shalt
[30:38] not committed
[30:39] three thou shalt not kill thou shalt not
[30:41] steal thou shalt not bear false witness
[30:42] thou shalt not covet and if there be any
[30:46] other commandment it is briefly
[30:47] comprehended in this one saying if
[30:50] there's any other commandment thou shalt
[30:52] love thy neighbor as one is telling you
[30:54] life Sunday that's the hardest thing you
[30:56] can do it's love the people that hate
[30:59] you it's the easy to come to church and
[31:02] love the people that love you but go out
[31:05] in the world and love those people that
[31:07] literally hate you right so but you
[31:10] gotta love them with the same love that
[31:12] you love our brothers and sisters that's
[31:15] why that's two like I said that's right
[31:19] there right before you get up to the
[31:20] headstone to me that's the hardest one
[31:25] that's the hardest one to comprehend is
[31:28] to love somebody that would literally
[31:30] hate you and love them with godly love
[31:33] don't guess now I'll let you don't just
[31:34] out let me handle it I love the fish but
[31:37] dang I have to do with love God okay
[31:39] right filial love agape love both of em
[31:42] you know he sectioned those all off love
[31:46] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[31:50] love is the fulfilling of all the law
[31:53] because if you love one another you're
[31:55] not gonna kill and do all these things I
[31:57] here committed or could kill still bear
[31:59] false witness covet you're just not
[32:03] going to do that if you if you have love
[32:05] they've got the love of God in your
[32:07] heart and that knowing the time now it
[32:12] is high time go without sleep that's
[32:15] 2,000 years ago that was written okay
[32:17] it's high time now that we wake out of
[32:20] sleep for now is our salvation nearer
[32:22] then when we believe and we all know
[32:25] that ostensibly we're closer to the
[32:29] rapture of the Nerds of the body change
[32:31] or in the resurrection than we ever have
[32:33] them before each day right the night is
[32:37] far spent the day is at hand let us
[32:40] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[32:42] and let us put on the armor of life
[32:44] well as the armor
[32:45] love joy peace longsuffering all those
[32:47] and these okay let us walk honestly as
[32:53] in the day not in rioting and
[32:55] drunkenness not in chambering and
[32:57] wantonness not in strife and envying but
[33:02] putting it on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[33:04] make not provision for the flesh to
[33:05] fulfill the lust thereof all right let's
[33:09] look on here see what just we're writing
[33:11] means it means revelry we know what
[33:15] drunkenness is chambering means what's
[33:20] sin see if this these will help with
[33:23] that well look right here well let me
[33:26] say what you know stop Aaron what does
[33:32] it mean
[33:35] define hello here we go define second
[33:41] day of the trial following subsequent
[33:45] succeeding strong huh yeah the strong
[33:53] one we read one strong but it was
[33:56] licentiousness that's a strong jump
[33:58] there yeah that's wrong anyway some
[34:02] people look up and we know what one is
[34:04] it's just lewdness
[34:06] not in strife and envying but put you on
[34:08] the Lord Jesus cons made no provision
[34:09] for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
[34:11] thereof we finally got through Romans 13
[34:15] now remember like I said before we're
[34:19] reading this as not chapters man put
[34:24] those characters in here this is not
[34:25] chapter 14 Paul is writing a letter and
[34:29] he's continually writing to the Romans
[34:31] what we've done is we couldn't break in
[34:33] they're human beings put a break in that
[34:35] but what his whole thought was what but
[34:40] you on the Lord Jesus Christ no
[34:42] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[34:44] lust thereof him that is weak in the
[34:46] faith so just keep going him that is
[34:48] weak in the faith receive ye but not to
[34:51] doubtful disputations in other words
[34:54] don't some right bring somebody in a
[34:56] week what does it mean what does listing
[34:58] businessmen promiscuous promiscuous
[35:01] don't be for I think that was probably
[35:02] close okay don't figure that was been
[35:11] there somewhere close to it because
[35:14] lascivious is lasciviousness and all
[35:16] that stuff together so in this weak in
[35:18] the faith receive ye but not to doubtful
[35:20] disputations other words here's the
[35:23] problem when we bring us Christian in we
[35:26] fill them full of brother Brown we need
[35:32] to fill them full of Christ brother Ram
[35:35] didn't save tell you how much a message
[35:37] you know he should tell them how you
[35:39] fire got let Christ lift your fire
[35:41] brother round in man yeah so that that's
[35:45] what that means if you bring in somebody
[35:46] new into the faith don't just keep
[35:49] brother Browns here brother I'm saying
[35:50] brother I'm saying they can't listen if
[35:51] they get the Holy Ghost I guarantee you
[35:54] they don't know what brother Brown said
[35:56] okay
[35:57] like the problem is we bring them in and
[35:58] put them in the message don't do this do
[36:01] this don't do that don't do this don't
[36:02] believe don't believe don't this bottle
[36:04] says repent and be baptized name of
[36:06] Jesus Christ get them to repent get them
[36:07] to be baptized name Lord Jesus Christ
[36:09] then they'll receive the Holy Ghost
[36:11] right a man right that's a promise to
[36:13] receive the Holy Ghost after you've been
[36:15] baptized after you've repented and then
[36:18] little sit and listen but don't sit
[36:20] there what's the problem you bring
[36:22] people in and don't have in this church
[36:25] but other church they bring them in
[36:26] they're just feeling full I'm sorry
[36:29] that's just the way it is and then some
[36:31] little something they'll hear well he
[36:34] might have been wrong over here or he
[36:37] might he might he might a bit him when
[36:39] they listen to the Lord Jesus Christ one
[36:41] thing he never was wrong he didn't say
[36:45] I'll almost be with the Holy Ghost he
[36:46] said I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost
[36:47] and I'll teach you things to come I'll
[36:50] be the one that teaches you
[36:53] jerk right and then if they don't get
[36:56] the holy ghost before that then you've
[36:59] just bruised fruit you just got somebody
[37:01] just pushes it all away
[37:03] but let them see Christ and then but
[37:07] that's the problem to you doubtful
[37:09] doubtful disputations is what happens
[37:10] now you bring them in and you you don't
[37:12] even have to just hear it from the
[37:13] pulpit you just somebody you know you
[37:15] know saying well we're gonna take this
[37:16] brother I people wouldn't take brother I
[37:18] need to tell them how about the pastor
[37:19] is to tell them how bad this thing's how
[37:21] bad this is going on what's going bring
[37:23] them in and be channel with their babies
[37:26] and then be gentle with the babies all
[37:28] right let's go
[37:30] we'll start with four Phoenix
[37:32] [Music]
