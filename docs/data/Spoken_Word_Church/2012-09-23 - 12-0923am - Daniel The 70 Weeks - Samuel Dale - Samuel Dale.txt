========================================

foreign service they want to stand Open the Eyes of My Heart number 28 the black velcro we don't know Open the Eyes of My Heart all right now eyes here everyone foreign we have one visitor amongst the others came in now you've been here before so you know how to end if you're here one time you come back you're not a visitor but we do have one visitor back there with us and we say to him welcome amen we always say you know you don't get a welcome a second time you get one the first time saying there's a lot of people here that are have been here before who glad to have you and if you would today you know I know we all got up this morning and took a bath so if we would set a little closer you know if you can that's right to get everybody seated a little bit better and everything and it's going to be fast and furious as we call it because we're going to try to uh taking a little trip to Daniel's 70 weeks amen this morning and this afternoon way to be taking the afternoon so we're going to do that and just get right into it and if it's something that you don't understand just remember we're talking about the Plan of Redemption whatever will put you and I into the millennium is the same thing God you know dying crucifying raising Jesus Christ doing the whole thing that will also put the Jews into the Millennium that's right amen all right now so then that's what we're trying to do so you know you just bear with us as we state things that maybe it will be a contrary to your thoughts maybe or even never heard the statements before right but we'll do the best we can to do that let's pray and ask the Lord to bless us remember all of the sick ones and different ones Clarence has already done this he'll remember that part father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us we thank you for Calvary and we just ask you Lord to help us this morning as we try to Endeavor to speak a little bit about some things that's in your word and that we may see you Lord and be guided in your understanding and father as we do then you come on the scene and help us and teach us by Thy word forgive our sins bless those that are sick among us the Lord just touch each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you may be seated now if anybody didn't get a copy of the notes we're trying to make 60 of them but uh not being uh right you know read with somebody next to you and uh that way maybe a husband and wipe my checkbooks together if you're reading the same notes we were our occasion probably but uh but as I said now we're trying we're going to try to to the new ones that haven't seen and heard the things um we're going to try to cover the Plan of Redemption for the Bride of Jesus Christ in her journey and and then we're going to do that by covering uh the Journey of redemption for Israel all right so then if we can see that and it ties together then we have a beautiful picture so we can follow it throughout the word of God so go ahead brother uh Anderson now if I say Joe and Anderson have who flips to which one I don't know but uh we've got this set up the best we could yesterday to try to help you to understand all right so look at the uh thing and we'll read Daniel 9 24. through 27. all right 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and make reconciliation for iniquity and bring in Everlasting righteousness and the self-division in Prophecy and anoint the most holy now if we finish we get to the part you'll see that that covers the Plan of Redemption for Israel and also as Wade will be covering this afternoon of the holy city the uh you know and and it will be not till this that it'll be a three-point Plan of Redemption to see the bride Israel and even the city because you know of what will happen in the Millennium huh verse 25 no therefore and understand that from the going forth to the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks now watch that keep that in mind we'll keep pointing to it three score and two weeks which would be 69 all right now mathematically all right and the street shall be built again in the wall even in trouble this time and after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end there I shall be with the flood and unto the end of the war desolation is determined and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determines shall be poured up on the desolate that's right so you see then you you've got verse 26 that you've got 62 three score and two weeks 62 to the coming up to Jesus Christ and him being cut off amen all right now verse 27 is basically aligned with the Antichrist that's right because it comes to the end time and he shall come from the Covenant with many for a week all right God never made a covenant with anybody for a week that's right he makes a covenant for returning to amen Satan copies because he knows what's left for Israel will have to do with it but then he it will come in in the Desolation and the different things man will take place all right now let's get started and read Fast and Furious and see all right now I want you to remember one thing brother Brown and we believe was the prophet we don't believe he was God we have never believed nothing like that right he was the prophet just like Paul was a prophet amen uh brother random calls um Paul Iranians or Colombo Martin Luther Wesley and even says the prophet came on today of Pentecost to Zeus's Street Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so then he could cover a prophet and and have no problems but we believe that God finished this whole thing up by sending us Elijah the prophet Amen to bring us the fullness of the word and make ready for a Rapture all right now in believing that then we must believe that what he says is correct amen no matter what we argue about whether it fits or not right but remember he's the prophet amen we are not and anybody listen to this you me whoever we have no right whatsoever to try to correct the prophet right a prophet stands before God and God only amen he will answer to God that's why he said you say what I say right all right and I've done it for 40 something years I've been standing in the Pulpit preaching that long and showing that brother random was not contradictory amen like everybody thinks you know well he might demonstrate here he made a mistake here well you want to go up here and talk about 30 minutes and let me dispect your message and I'll tell you you have any mistakes you make because that's human in error part but now the message is Right amen the man himself even taught like why horse rider was a Holy Ghost but then he corrected that right because he was not infallible right right that's right but the message is invaluable because the message is the Bible amen that's right do you believe the Bible's infallible amen all right and I can show you a lot of things in there that looks like it's contrary right you remember when you read it yes you remember how you argued about the water baptism words in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or father Son and Holy Ghost you know well you know it's in there George got to come together and make a picture if not you got a contradiction that's right a little Sonny Wade if we would deal with the prophets mentioned but if it fits together then it cannot be in any argument whatsoever as to what it is all right you might say well um why is it important that we understand the Daniel 70 weeks what is important well why is it important to understand anything I remember discussing this years ago with someone and they they said do you think water baptism is essential under salvation I've talked for a minute I said the truth is Right amen the truth is essential in Salvation well Jesus said You shall know the truth all right so then the truth is essential right so if it's in the word of God then it's essential amen what do we need to know these things to be saved well some people are saved by knowing you're in these things then but some people are known and say by hearing John 3 16 you want to take it out no no we want to leave all of it correct or that we can depend upon the Bible and then you come and show me I invite it to the world come and show me we're running around and missed it but now don't come and say he say it you bring it to me from the Bible and you bring me what he said amen all right and then we'll discuss it amen but you're going to have to listen to what I say right about the rest of it because I believe it'll all fit together or else he wasn't the problem right that's right amen and if he wasn't the prophet maybe you are the prophet that can straighten him out yeah thanks I am my wife don't like me to go like that into the camera but that just gets the point across you'll never forget that when I do that statement and make that point all right but now this do you say well why is it important to understand all right let's just read about it three or four other statements real fast and get it done do it with number one brother and you got your notes you can follow with us make these homes and now it may be hard for you to follow down the side of it over here with a little bitty one two three four but smaller the quote this on the screen all right I said anyone Vehicles instructions to Daniel Revelation 6 1 to 19 21 is connected with the 70 weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 in weeks because if you don't want you you miss there's no seals you miss the trumpets you miss the vowels those flags those three unclean spirits like frogs no stream woes and casting out of the red dragon the woman in the sun you'll miss it all if you don't and that code it takes place right here in this 70th week that's where it takes place all right now so it seemed like it must be important heaven thank you forgive me for putting a cough drop in okay I don't Advocate you putting a candy in the mouth but you know sometimes my voice goes and we gotta have that part all right don't forget me look at the next one this is paragraph 22 the sixth full purpose and I do not believe there's one person here for that purpose I believe that we are here tonight because we are deadly sincere honestly at wanting to know the saith the Lord amen number three that's the reason we're praying to God to make that so perfect that there will be no one chatter of doubt be not one shot of that finance a word you just put it any harm I'm 72. okay so God we're not supposed to put her on interpretation to to those things it's got to come through thus say of the Lord or I'm leaving it right there until I understand try all right all right now is this important with the next one paragraph 191 now the 70th week let me say something here to you and to the world I mean anybody listening I'm using the 2010 version of the message the 99 version will say the 70 weeks of Daniel just in case somebody you know looks up and says that's wrong the 99 and the 95s and all users and they'll say the 70 we can send you 70 weeks a day but then the new version uses the 70th week when it comes to that last part all right to remember that I got 191 and I wish you'd listen quietly now just for a moment the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting again re-quoting so you won't forget this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my pen while I was writing all right so is it true what the prophet would be saying in the dangle 70 weeks amen he said we we need to wait till we have to accept the Lord he said I won't speak until I do so he did all right yep that's right now he says this is what the Holy Spirit put on his pen to write the people of the message are real good to go over to spoken words original see we wrote around and said in the back said the holy spirit said take up your pen and write and they'll have that for thus saith the Lord but what about Daniel 70 weeks all right amen so now you tell me he was wrong because that's what we're going to get into in a minute we're going to see that people are going to say he's wrong here he's wrong here he's wrong there okay I want your Vindication all right that's all I'm asking for that's right I want your Vindication I don't want her stupidities right amen I want your Vindication right all right now see then all right what is it then is it important to know so let's cover the 70 weeks of Daniel all right you're going to find out it'll be 490 years because they're 70 weeks and we'll cover in a minute in a week in seven years and the prophet will prove it by the Bible as we go along so we just let him make the statements all right so we're going to have to see the Plan of Redemption amen all right so then we've already said and read in Daniel that they were seven years in building our 49 years seven weeks in building the Temple we'll get to that in a minute you know back there all right we've got that in here in case you're smart enough to figure out the Bible says 46. we got that in the second floor covered all right but then you got the 62 weeks right and then you got one week left Amen to make you 490 years to Israel all right now watch the Oddity in a second on that in case I repeat it isn't it odd that Jesus said I mean they said how many times do we forgive what did Jesus say yeah he said we'll forgive him seven times he said no 70 times seven multiply that that's 490 in case you need it all right that's kind of an odd point isn't it but it's not too hard go ahead and listen let's start with number five all right these are basically all be interested in the week of Daniel so if I forget to do it I'll give you the purpose paragraph 49. now today we're approaching what is the 70 weeks this is about a part of the 70 weeks now we know the scripture cannot lie they have to be truth and if this Angel Gabriel come and told Daniel that there was only 70 weeks left to the Jews now if we apply that to six days or seven days see where would you be right if you're only going to cover it right 70 weeks you've learned it just weeks seven days in a week and 70 weeks you know you you have four to 90 days or something you'd calculate all but you ain't gonna do no good right but look what he said but in Prophecy it's always give in Parable amen all right giving Parables next Matthew 13 34 says and all these things Jesus take unto the multitude and parables and why without a parable spake he not unto them you remember all of the parables in the Bible and Jesus would the disciples would come and what is this parable you know the Pharisees finally one day figured out this guy is Parabola using Parables to kill us so that's why they killed him right because he was using Parables they figured it out there in a while get out the end of the reading right they said he's talking about us all right man without a parable expect you not now so remember Daniel 70 weeks I told Wade when years ago when he asked me what about the 70 weeks of Daniel and I said right over the top of every page of the book Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable that's right and I said when you finish the book you'll see it's a parable amen correct all right now what is a parable go ahead the Greek word for that is 38.50 means a parable figure comparison proverb I'm placing a one thing by the side of another usual position of what that word is which means side by side to position anything as of ships in battle that's metaphor I guess you call it a comparing comparison of one thing with another likeness similitude an example by which a Doctrine or precept is Illustrated right so that's a parable you listen to a man that planted a seed or locking into this or locking them to that right see do we say it no we've good Baptists and all you know well we can understand it we understand because Jesus explained The Parables we read the next verses where explain it to the disciples you know that was still a parable sure until you're born again legal scripture no man can call Jesus a Christ except it be why what the Holy Ghost amen see though you can read and understand reading and understanding is not what it is it must be revealed you're gonna stop a drunk going down the highway and say Jesus say Jesus is a Christ you say Jesus Christ oh he's born again that's no more than someone that said water baptism under regeneration let's go to Lake Lanier we'll fill up the kingdom we'll just push them in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you see that silly no that's what I'm saying is how silly we are see we say we know we understand the parables but do we do we understand The Parables that's right not until we're born again that's right that's the key to the whole thing neither is it Daniel 70 weeks understood unless you're born again all right yes sir now so they're doing that now why would God put things in a parable anyway number eight why would he put in for our appreciate these brothers that will do these things in the videos and run them back and forth because this killed you a lot of times look what he said on this paragraph 71 to 70 a week you come back to what's done and things are going on but that all was done in the great economy of God to keep the church watching and praying being ready how their garments washed in the blood of the Lamb amen it's done to keep you and I checking up all right amen the Bible says examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not all right we better examine ourselves every day especially now right that's right right so God does it number nine Deuteronomy 13 1-3 we like that one word says if a prophet comes and gives you a sign that come to pass you got to believe him but people don't read this one Deuteronomy 13 1-3 if there arise among your Prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give it thee a sign or a wonder what and this sign our Wonder come to pass 40 people laying out in exist to prove I'm right and they're all going to raise the debt and they'll raise them to death now what are you gonna do what are you gonna do see I'm not asking are you going to believe the man now watch what he said where are these fake unto thee saying he's going to give you the signs and wonders will take place but then he's teaching you a Doctrine watch it yep bro he speak unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them now watch amen I shall not hearken unto the words of that Prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you right to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul he does it to prove it right yeah yeah all right what about a wonderful guy to do that you mean he would let signs and wonders take place sure he's doing it in the in those taking place to prove yep but it's to prove whether or not we love him because we love him we love his word amen right that's right and if we won't stay with his word then we fail the test simple amen not to scare nobody plain language right that's right it's true all right so now let's get on with it well there's one more just bypass 10. oh yeah this is time tested time tested Memorials of God prayer e47 every time the sickness strikes your home every time the trial strikes your home every time the neighbor say something bad about you it's only shaking you he's explaining the tree how it is shaking to the tree makes it grow into the ground and get deeper Roots right and only shaking you loosening you up as soon as you get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word that's how God does it he sends those trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you a new hope it's good sometimes for somebody to differ with you then somebody comes along they say hey what happened what about this yeah yeah I'm gonna go read again all right right so it's good for us okay now go ahead and let's place it only the board the chart now this is the drawing wrote a random made and used and we have proof now canceled this one for one time right now all right we have proof that this is the official one that brought around drug I received mine and I have it in my Bible you know Weatherby but I received mine in 67 or 68 one the first time I guess we were close to the Tabernacle or something and uh may have even been 66 when I met brother Mo but anyhow we have proof from people and I don't call names anymore couldn't get out of there but if they say that was the drawing we use it this afternoon because they knew how the copies to where the brother sent it to them to prove that that was the very drawing brought around May all right now I contend this drawing and the Bible and the prophet's message are all the same amen yes sir and to go contrary to it yep we would be having to change what he's saying amen let me see we can't do it right we've got to stay with what he's saying amen even though as I said we would maybe not uh find some seats for some of these even though we would differ as to what we think man go ahead I didn't make my statement do what you want to amen we don't correct the prophet that's what they're doing in the end time now that's right that's right they're saying he was wrong here and he was wrong go ahead you just need your own hope amen all right no problem ain't mad at nobody I just think what I believe right yeah but look what he says now we read in Daniel they're seven weeks three score in two weeks all right that's 69. okay far end you'll see seven years or seven death week right all right you look at your drawing you have it you'll turn over in your nose you have a drawing if you'd like to follow along I believe that fits exactly the Bible or that Daniel says that they'll be you know the building of the temple then it would be um 62 weeks and then it would be one week left Amen to Israel and Satan copies after that to run his amen oh deal at the end all right now this may look odd because of the people that are teaching the message and leaving this over here you know all right but now he done it so now do that right argue with that all you want to we'll give you a couple of quotes I think he uses about six times speaking of the chart as a matter of fact he even spoke of the chart down in Tifton Georgia all right go ahead and pull up your brother Joe not the other drawing jump over that for a second and pull up the number 11a you know which is 41. oh there we go maybe you don't have it in yours okay he's doing it back up okay we got we got a split condition on this thing all right forgive me now look what he said he said oh this is perfect 41 this end of the week oh what a lesson I said to my wife the other day yep I wonder if the people are really getting it now I want you to get it amen don't if you we have to stay here all day long just stay amen now we'll we may have to be here like lunch now we'll we we want to get it see we we want to know what that is true you see they want to know through and you if you can just only see it I asked Mike maybe then afterwards I'm going to leave the chart here the chart the drawing we just showed yeah I'm going to leave it here and you can draw it out afterwards come in here this afternoon when you want to and draw out the charts and so forth and it'll help you to understand that's the reason I put it in dark okay go ahead brother Anderson to the next program 99. and if you notice on my chart here I want you to get this now and draw it you notice here where I got the cross that's where they rejected but the time extended out just a little bit further on see why 30 40 50 60 seven that's the Titus and we'll go back to the drawing you'll see 40 years later it's Titus the Roman general destroyed Jerusalem destroy Israel Jerusalem and Scattered the people of the world okay thank you brother Anderson go back now brother Joe to the to the drawing right not the sex of the first one the original okay okay there you go now we got it all right then you see seven weeks 62. come on over there he said to check it and see that's right all right now a lot of people don't believe that drawing to be authentic but we have proof that it is and that's fine that's right I have proof enough to note myself but when I received it that I did receive that drawing right there are a couple of other drawings that are kind of touched up and there was one recently that would put out in the Philippines that went over a little bit too far right and I'll compare that with this next drawing that we do now so you see what I'm saying seven weeks 62 weeks make 69 weeks 483 years right here that means that there's exactly seven years left over on the other side all right now go up and I will show you what people believe you're looking in your notes you'll see it turned kind of sideways let's see what people believe now legal drawings that's where we got them I Want It That Way see this is what people believe right most of the people of the message I've ever talked to this is their Doctrine that's right all right and to make their Doctrine come out right then I just made a little by Brother Joe's help a little drawing where we kind of edited what we originally had you know you look over here they're 69 weeks one week left this is what basically people believe they believe that seven weeks 62 and a half weeks which would give you the three and a half years of the ministry of Jesus Christ in this three and a half years over here on that side through the two prophets now you keep that drawing because that drawing is vital to you because that is exactly what most people are saying and the one from the Philippines that's right almost identically matches right that all right so you see that there's a difference I'm showing you what people believe because the only way you can believe it is that away if you're not going to believe the truth then amen all right you're gonna have to believe that Jesus preached see what they believe is Jesus come up here to 80 30. we'll get something in just a minute on that and over there and then he preached three and a half years to come up to 80 33. you see that's what they think right did Jesus come up 69 weeks up to here and one half a week extended over here on Jesus ministry and that makes it work out now simple little mathematical calculations if you look back over here you'll see a little calculations called 80 30 and you'll see another one called 80 70. all right if this drawing is right you would have to have that ad70 three and a half it wouldn't calculate and what I'm saying is none of these things will match as we go through it you'll see that don't match right all right so then we got to stay with us we've got ahead and cancel this one and let's move on all right go to number 12. all right now let's take what he's saying and get on with it and remember the drawing is there any way you can put that drawing back up over here or switch to folks over there in this number here how many original one I want the original drawing okay so you can watch as we read now let's Outlet outline Daniel 70 of weeks Burger 61. now I'm not repeat here again Ministers of gospel if you disagree with this all right they were divided in three periods amen and we find out in Daniel now we read Daniel in divides in three periods that's right first a seven week period I hear the inner three score let me get my corner not seven weeks we're trying to figure out why not get something I brought my sword out here I said if that don't work on this brother calling you different all right so what's he say it's divided into three periods one two three all right now first just one week here seven seven week period 49 years to build another Temple right here all right and then a three score in two weeks 60 which is 62 weeks then a one week period left amen they're divided into three and he said I got to divide it on the board here's the first period second period to my understanding by the gospel the End of Time returns to the Jews all right so now you say but now brother Dale let's see is that the one where we got it next on it I have to follow my own notes all right we're going down we're going down one more then we'll pick up or something so watch that when we get down so go ahead and change it 72 progress 72. now if there was look there's exactly 49 days not 49 years rather than the time of the building of the temple the seven or seven prophetic weeks seven weeks because there was seven weeks determined to the temple to rebuild the Temple and it was to build it was built in exactly 49 years now watch that we're going to get a scripture in a second now we have the meaning of the time of weeks because as the Bible said the angel said it taken seven weeks until the building of the Temple that's a that's uh Daniel 9 24. all right and it was exactly 49 years building the Temple from the March the 14th until the BC 538 until the temple was restored again and the streets were bestowed remember the temple was trying to try to build a two or three times back in the Old Testament they finally got it built I'm not talking about the rich that's talking about the original but it was talking about also the owners coming through right all right so what do we got what do you get for seven weeks it means 49 years then one week equals seven years seven times seven is 49 just exactly there you are now there's no more questioning about it we know now that each week meant seven years have you got it let's say it together one week's equal seven years one week into seven years all right now in case you two are out there or anyone else click up the next my brother's joke and brother Anderson never who's pulling those quotes right look at John then said the Jews 40 and six years you remember Jesus said destroyed this Temple my raise up three days this was their answer 46 years was his temple in building you look down rearing up in three days wow contradiction between Daniel 9 24 and John two unless you go back and read Daniel 9 24 if you look back in front of your page and he said and the walls and the streets were built in trouble sometimes 46 years they were correct in the temple restoration are building the Temple but it took the other three three years to do the streets in the city so Daniel and John is not contrary that's not a contradiction see that's what I said as long as you lay them out yeah and you keep studying God put them together where you don't have a question about it all right now here's the one going with number 15. here's the one that we were talking about a while ago where Jesus said well how many times you forgive a man Jesus said 70 times 7. that's 490 or 490 times if you read on you'll find out it says and again if yes so you say now brother Mark I'm right on the border you only got one more but it said and again make your life a little get going all right now let's start on this part and cover the 62 weeks seven years we've covered in the building Temple let's cover the 62 weeks before and we'll get up to 483 years all right so we can pull up number 16. all right Cindy equipment Daniel progress 78. Messiah was Christ now he comes right in here but here's where he's crucified amen all right you say yeah but that's 30. hang on okay just hold on a little bit and made it to it make it 69 weeks so whatever you do back here is 69 weeks it's not 69 and a half in the cross amen it's 69 weeks all right you're mathematically off if you go the other way of that drawing we just had oh and I don't believe that yeah okay 7.69 483 years and getting it down if you want to run over it I'll be glad to do it now we're told from the going for the command to rebuild it send it to the Messiah shall be seven that's seven that's the first first right here seven weeks three score in two weeks 62 weeks and seven is 69 and that's 69 weeks seven times 69 would make 483 years therefore until the Messiah now we're coming up to this part here so evidently he was pointing them here right yeah it's going to be 483 years that's right okay amen now in that 483 years there is even a quote and brought around in the silver that word that Jesus is actually cut off 62 weeks out of the 70. and that's exactly what happened when they finish that template the Jews rejected God sure for 62 weeks come on when they finish that Temple it was downhill way back here but when they got that temple built it was downhill and they finally killed a man and all of this was about that's right and that's just to show you how technical bro around a minute he said it's 62 weeks he was cut off I didn't bring that quote all right but now listen let's see something here as we go let's make sure these are correct so we go up to paragraph 80. now now Jesus rode into the city of Jerusalem drive on the back of about you on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30. right all right Jesus wrote in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and remember Palm Sunday is one Sunday before the resurrection all right amen so this is not the start of his ministry right right you understand this is not the start of his ministry when he rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday was was the Sunday before the crew for the resurrection so he was crucified on Friday raised on Sunday right amen now now for bc445 the ad30 is exactly 473 years but we've already seen now watch it the 69 weeks makes 183 years now there's where the trouble comes in right there we've got only with the marking of the Bible here time only 475 years and actually it's 483 a difference of eight years all right now God can't make it Miss if he said it would be so many days or so many days he said so much to me so much what are we going to do BC 475 to 80 30 if you in our astronomy years which are 365 and a four in each but we reduce them days to our prophetic calendar prophetic calendar is 360 days right amen each month only had 30 days all right all right when you come over to the flood and you come over to the fall the in the garden it would have been 360 when you fell to the fall and Men come out it made it for 365 and a fourth and especially vindicating up to the flood because that's where the Earth went from this to this right right and begin to wobble so you got 365 to four days right amen all right now watch so go ahead and put up the next number 16. we got 16a tonight we got to go to this notice uh as part of that looks modification okay maybe we didn't put in the modification because we don't multiplication Brother Anderson okay all right you can figure it out anyway all right you multiply 475. Now watch how close your profit was mathematically brother Joe's noted on this side okay okay 475 he says we're off because we got 475 right he said we need 483. sodium multiply 475 by 365.25 don't do it with one-fourth you've got a problem 0.25 you mathematicians are good at that especially if we can make our one even he's a rafter he knows that goes 25. all right all right equals 173493.75 let's do it by 365.25 are what did we say take that number one seven three four nine point seven five divide it by 360 you come out to be 481.9270833333 in other words you come out to 482. do you say yeah he said they don't pay one year off you're in the period of time are you familiar with this we mentioned this at The Minister's meeting you know a lot of them didn't even know this the calendars has been changed three times you've got the Greg ruin the Pope the Alexandra Julian the calendars has been changed so it's easy to miss one one week I mean one one year I'm not trying to justify him I'm just saying because when he said it's got to be 483 I don't care if we modify that and it don't come out right it's 483. that's what God says okay you know that's what your Prophet said it was amen amen all right but you've got your calendars have changed one year they had 200 and something days in one year uh one year they had a change into the calendar one year they had 13 months in the in the year the line of stars back up see you know you noticed the other day not too long ago the prophet mentioned ain't done it again that had a faculty clock right come on you're wobbling right they had to add a second to the time clock to make it perfect they're having to change all constantly because we're wobbling but when she goes back to 360. right yeah you're right you'd be perfect amen right now okay so then just to show them you how I close and how mathematically a man can be and yet people will argue all right look at 17 and let's pick up something very interesting paragraph 84. our prophetic calendar to bring us to 360 days and we use now in the scripture we have exactly 483 there it is 183. how we have exactly proof of the prophecy exactly the truth more far from the time of the going forward to build a temple and to destroy or when they rejected Christ and killed him in A.D 33. and we just read one where that they killed him in A.D 30. okay when Christ was killed makes exactly 483 years pull the drawing back up over here 493 a year 62 7 483. right keep that in mind just leave that number okay all right safe job going to the next when God had the undiluvian world and destroy the water they changed the astronomy date and then let the Romans come in and make up their calendar which it hits and Miss until 4 short and disproving the point get to the bottom there it is exactly 483 years from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to restore the bill until the time of prayer Messiah was rejected rejected 183 years still keeping your calendars and everything is balanced all right and we're going to get something in a second about that well here we are go ahead with number 19. no let's take something you just see if you understand you know that our calendar systems is all goofed up you know that Jesus were actually born in 4 BC that's right sure how many of you know that I mean I actually know that he was born in 4 BC because you can prove it by the king that was in command in his death and what took place and all you can prove right they see they were trying to run the calendars now we've got this so we don't need it don't pull it up brother joke on this two headaches I'm going to make a statement it's going to be contrary to your thinking right around is exactly right when he said 483 and he's exactly right I mean when he said 1833 and he's exactly right when he said 80 30. because according to the calendar we're under Jesus was crucified 80 33. according to the calendar we're under because they put us on number one right but according to what happened really Jesus was born for BC 432-1123 you might imagine that they've had it figured out totally 80 33 in 80 30 is the same date if you got chance enough to be able to think our calendar starts one two three four five right but if Jesus was born for BC you're gonna go four one four three two one one two three four five so he's riding both places this needs a little sense a lot of Revelation now you're a mathematician but I got a little sense but this is what I want you to see Jesus rode into Jerusalem until they see the Jerusalem trap on the back of a hot mule on Palm Sunday April 2nd 80 30. right Palm Sunday was one week one Sunday before the resurrection everybody know that amen Palm Sunday is one Sunday before the Resurrection Sunday we call it so he was crucified on Friday we got the proof of these they argue this even in the message they're arguing it but Jesus was crucified on Friday raised the Bible said early the first day of the week amen the old Doctrine is and he was crucified on Wednesday and he went into grade three days and three nights and when it finally all got councilmated out he come up on Saturday afternoon nope you never heard that old doctor that's all you organized religious God he raised on Saturday afternoon hung around all night appeared to John appeared to the disciples Sunday morning your Prophet said he died on Friday raised on Sunday that's right the Bible said he rose early the first day of the week they didn't say he rose on Saturday the last day the seventh and finally come up on the eighth day now I said he rose right so we got the Bible and I want you to remember that April 2nd he said will he change that later well let's see if he did look tonight making sure you're not stable but I know it's a little bit okay so here's brother random speaking in 1963 324 in the morning series questions and answered on the sealed paragraph 188 now we know that Jesus was slain about 80 30. all right that's right it was about the middle of the year I guess 80 30. but the Bible said he was fighting for the foundation work right okay so now after the seals because people want to say I want what he's got in his sword in that hand you know that's what everybody wants when the word comes to the prophet you better remember when the word comes to the Prophet The Sword in his hand he come to the Tabernacle and was going to preach the white horse rider as the Holy Spirit until he was corrected that's right so because he's got the sword in the hand don't mean he's got it in his heart right right simple right Revelation you say well let's go with god let's go one more minute look at this one now on The Sixth Seal paragraph 148. now let's stop there these three verses it took place actually on Tuesday afternoon April the 4th 80 30. and the first two remember that's when they asked him the questions and the answers that come up into the seals right in Matthew in the scripture April the 4th A.D 30 and the two verses took place in the at first two verses that plays an afternoon of the April the 4th at 80 30. Julius three times he's using 80 30. right now you showed me where he uses 33 and keeps it correct all I'm asking but did you catch what we're looking at the first one was Palm Sunday April the second Sunday Monday Tuesday your profit was so mathematically correct this statement says that that took place on April the 2nd this one says April the 4th yeah how perfect can a man be that had a nice great education her seventh grade just giving you that approval Point amen all right so keep that in mind Sunday Monday Tuesday April 2nd was Sunday Monday is the third Tuesday is the fourth Jesus was crucified on Friday about the seventh or something Rose then on the first day of the week amen so he's mathematically correct he knows but even though now I say this I don't know of any word would run around and said Jesus was born before BC I'll run that I don't know but evidently new because his mathematics is right right and his mathematics is yours right and see Jesus then was crucified 80 30. God dealt with the Jews to 80 70. we'll cover that more this afternoon when I think about it April the 2nd April the 4th Lydia's crucifixion Resurrection Church ages and then he comes back to deal so if this is right over here that'll have to be right away and that's the main thing I want to deal with so go ahead and paragraph 23. well we got you know we got Luke in there yeah all right the reason we got Luke is because maybe you didn't notice your Prophet says that Jesus was born in April right and crucified in April now get me three and a half years of ministry in there thank you if you're doing that you'll come exactly where I'm talking about but if you're not you're going to lap yourself over and miss it right how could it be born in April crucified in April preach 33 or have a 33 and a half years everybody wants to die did you understand what I'm saying if he's born in April crucified April how do you preached three and a half years because Luke says in Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age so we entered the ministry at 29 and a half right he entered the minister at 29.5 he did not the way he was 30 to enter the ministry internet 29.5 according to Luke all right so that makes it perfectly correct all right all right then you can preach three and a half years because he could enter the ministry at 29 and a half man and I give him the half a year Technically when you're putting it that he was crucified in April 83rd you would go back to 26 and a half or 27-91 of the two way to cover that this evening you would come to Mary come up to 80 30. right but if you get what I'm saying he entered the ministry 2909. all right now let's get into it and try to run real fast go ahead and run it number 20 28. 3 all right I got 94. you thought about 144 000 don't appear all right the road they appear not in the third chapter they're on over in the scriptures father and now we see that all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week last week now that they're now that they're already at 69 weeks and living exactly the way God said they did and happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more week promise to the Jews all right now here's where the people say according to that drawing we had want to go they say there's only three and a half years I've been around say that one week after the Rapture yes sir let's prove that moment as we go along go to the next one I got 96. now we come up and we're we got them up here to the rejection of Messiah and from the rejecting them beside the last week all right and you can read all the way down we got all the rights today 70 weeks left one more than seven years you know so you got in front of trying to short time okay go to the next 25 this is paradigm 105. and you you haven't got any limited time like the Jews see we don't Virginia well we got a sign what is a sign this one's our sign amen all right yes was our sign God did oh back it up you click one too quick leave it at one radio well God did with the Jews exactly what he said he would do in them 69 years or 483 years for 69 weeks and one week left one week she had determined amen you want to say at the doctrine among the people is only three and a half years after the Rapture but around 77 years actually that's right so which one we're going to tell you hey man go to the next one this is paragraph 188 right here where did the massage get cut off exactly where the word said where will that 70th Week begin exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jew amen where will send this week begin amen right all right it'll begin exactly when the church is cut off happy 165. and in the middle of this week now here's the 70. now these exactly were seven years in each one of the weeks we were already at 69 weeks and then we have the Gentiles page and we know that we're at the end Gentile then there's one more week left for the Jews that's exactly seven years trying to save time you've got the quilts even real next you notice we're giving about four or five quotes which is one week left amen all right notice the 69 weeks hit perfectly the Jews were in their Homeland in a gentile Church age exactly to the end time to the Nickelodeon time or to the lady of CNN how close it is to the coming of the Lord the ending of the thing into the thing the end of this age in the Rapture the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone amen and he said if you can see that raise your hand now hand many by God raised their hand everybody the congregation was waving yeah we see it but when he died we don't see him the hand went down you know they missed what he was to say all right let's see what else brother next these 69 weeks hit perfectly going away the juicy perfectly the church ate it perfectly we're at the end the end time jump down the morning he starts the 70s week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting you read this in the morning you read that one long ago right the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting again re-quoting so he won't forget this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my opinion while I was writing so they just went through that's right proven this is right this is right and this is right that's right so there's seven years after the Rapture of the church amen that is not is not the old denominational teaching the old denominational teaching is that there is a seven year tribulation period right after the Rapture there's a chosen people who go up but there's some people that are going to be left that are bride Church that are going to be here for three and a half years and have to give their lives and things but that's still part of the Bride you know and then go into chaos with Elisha height and that's to Israel so they got what they call a minor tribulation for the first three and I in a major tribulation that is not what brother Brown is talking about right but I started out with my saying he never taught no word show it to me did he ever taught a seven years of tribulation right no that's not only art right to me you always talked three and a half years of tribulation amen that lines up with Jacob's trouble all right all right in your Bible about to line up with Jacob struggle let's see what we're in 29. we'll get back to this part down in here in just a minute if we don't get it just remember Jacob's trouble is great and one high of year it's not Jacob working for them amen Jacob's trouble Jacob's trouble is this right here three and a half years of the tribulation that will strike Israel this is exactly what he says Great Tribulation period a cleansing I'm standing it away ahead of time a cleansing of the land right here's Armageddon you got it right there Armageddon takes place here and then there's time passed the Armageddon amen for the cleansing of the land getting ready for the Millennium amen we'll get down the description do something look at number 30. not on the marathon mode this is paragraph 83. no excuse and he's coming down with the times of the 77 I'm not going to get into and here we are at the End of the Age after coming into this Indian we we don't know what time that the church will be gone oh my we don't know coming into the 70th week okay now look at 31. I have 83. yesterday's over here in Revelations 13 or 11 chapter in the third version them two prophets will prophesy 1203 score days then they're cut off an Armageddon sits in and if that be so you're talking about the 30 days and the months and the protein backers and forth go to the next paragraph 167. this is where the Antichrist comes back in what he's doing he makes a covenant quick as we leave out of here right and we've got a thing that I'm not going to release it here we've got a thing proven something that's that I say is the very head of what the world is going to think when they find out that this Pope is going to set that Covenant in motion I won't say it on here because we got the paper today but it was on the news of what the pope said uh-huh but if we can't prove that we better hold on now we've got the papers to prove this off another some of you already heard it know what it is I'm just not putting it on here I say that's the beginning because the man made an honest statement that's right of what preceded now the world is going to fall at his feet and say he's honest we would write about what was back here but now this man is changing because you got to make a covenant right come on folks now we work for General Motors right some of us the Bible said he'll confirm his Covenant for a week confirmed is not the word covenant heart when you had a covenant you started a year or two but when the contract was running out you started a year before the ending of the contract and they started negotiating negotiating negotiating it runs up to the time of the contract and they shine in agreement with the with the big head of the Union officials and the big head of the company officials that's not a contract that's why it says he confirmed to confirm is to ratify or establish but when the rank and file voted on that contract it became a contract when the world system takes the Antichrist Doctrine she will confirm that Covenant that's right brother amen the Catholic Church as of the last I know of I said me he is not a member of the World Council churches all right all right you may think it is go check it they're not a member of the workouts in church because the Bible said you got to come in by flattery is going to be invited in to control run around in the field books that they're looking for a Superman to come and take over and he said they're going to get one they don't believe it run any computer Superman you'll go straight to the seal book they're going to get a Satan Superman that's right brother that Satan Superman is going to be so sweet and humble until he's invited in and he makes craft to prosper is that the Book of Daniel that's right amen oh we need it right now don't we it'd be better if they put the pope as president God he's the guy that's got the money yeah that's right right my parents said we all moved up years ago when brother Branham said that the Catholic church was given a fall ago that was when it was probably 35 an ounce you just think if we took a thousand dollars a piece and bought a thousand dollars worth of gold at 35 an ounce you realize what you'd have ma'am when it's 17 or 18. 17 point something 100 from that we don't be rich then I'd get to talk to me I'd be super real you knew it Danny why didn't you do it then all right listen get you buy it where you thank them but now listen you know sometimes people think that ain't a good thing to do but I'm not a speaker but a speaker knows how to get your attention to get you back now done we can talk okay he makes his Covenant and in the midst of the 70th week no bring that over here to you and you only have three and a half here no you got him right here right that's right he don't break his gun a year I've seen before the church as you start come on yep so after we get out of here in that one week he breaks just go to the nurse worm again he sets in the temple of God showing himself to be as God oh he goes in smooth and flattery to get the whole world behind you you're going to make everything work oh you'll have you think it didn't work out when this last guy said and lady come out of it and I'm not throwing off on him telling the truth she said he's gonna pay my house rent yeah he gonna buy me a car yeah right yeah well didn't work out too good all right let's see when they're going to flattery this guy in yep he's going to be the greatest of all he's going to admit that he was wrong he already is he's admitted he's right boy it's gonna be beautiful because she's going to cause crap to prosper and then how can you argue with it come on we're all under the big buddy system Brothers how many is in here one two three four five six calling Social Security I'm just counting that someone's I know what happened to Mark me cut that out why did he do that don't tell him he can't do that they've done done did it that's okay man right what if they kill you you can't get into more well fire you can't get into more assistance who are you going to eat I didn't say what are you going to eat I said who are you going to eat ain't enough Dearborn come on all right let's go on he makes a covenant he breaks it in the middle of the week taking breaks his Covenant in the middle of the week right here at arm again that's when God comes down when he breaks that Covenant that devil stands right there incarnate in the Beast absolutely amen he went from the Mount of sin and through here until there and he stands in the temple being the Beast amen he asked the prophet questions answers I mean you don't question an answer did second Thessalonians the amount of sin I think well God show himself to be out of God fulfill the first seal he said yes right so when that Antichrist comes in there he's going to be the beast in common Satan right when he had the Beast back like it was in the garden Right started with a beast Minds up with me but those two prophets will be what giving their message right here right and then he moves in right here that is a cleansing purifying we're going to prove I got time before hold on here is the statements most people make is it only three and a half years of time after the Rapture and that's what most of you Ministers of the message that I've ever heard speak on it that's right now I say it never hurts me coming right that they have three and a half years after the Rapture of the church then Armageddon and chaos nothing else all right quote number 33. let's prove this fallacy to be wrong Daniel 11 verse 12 11 and 12. and from the time of the daily sacrifice I'm gonna read something right there now let's see how many kids and from the time of the daily sacrifice shall be taken away in the ablation that make an excellent setup there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days right anybody caught it that's 10 days overdone over the two witnesses hang on blessed is he that waiteth and come to the thousand three hundred five in 30 days so in the Book of Daniel there's time after the Armageddon right right at least 1300 and something days but as I said in what wage copy it's gonna be a thousand two hundred and ninety days 42 months according to the Bible with the two witnesses is 1260 days Daniel know what he's talking about he goes to 30 days past it and then even says Glory it's blessed if you make it to 75 days so there's got to be according to the Bible 75 days past Armageddon now let's go over the Bible there could be a whole lot more so we had with paragraph 34. watch the temple now here's what's contrary to most people in the nation they don't believe a temple to be built in the millennium listen it is not a temple for offering sacrifices that 144 000 is turned to Christ they will not be offering sacrifices in the Millennium don't worry about your little animals it ain't going to be killed in the millennium all right but there is a temple to be built amen what far do prove the curse is gone right amen why do we have a Thousand-Year Millennial Reign to prove the sin curse it was put on in the garden right that Methuselah live 969 years but he didn't make it to a thousand so somebody's going to live a thousand years called Millennial Reign amen you don't make no difference to me and you because we're going to be Eternal there we're going to be on a honeymoon we're going to be there with our husband watch I got 199. I see full purpose of getting a visit to Daniel now watch the description of the temple that is to be built in the millennium well that's just his words okay now anyone any reader all right theologians where you at yeah in the message where you at that from Ezekiel 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter there's nothing in the world but the millennium temple being arrested on Earth damn it he gives you the scripture during the Millennium is going to be a temple Bell now Ezekiel 40-44 we just read in Daniel what 75 extra days right proving this time after the Millennium I mean after the Armageddon early time after Armageddon we've proved by the Bible now let's prove it again go ahead to Ezekiel look at this now remember Ezekiel 44 is a millennium Temple Ezekiel 39. one before you get to 40 . yeah right right read the whole chapter I was going to read it all but don't have time to look right they that dwell in the city of Jerusalem shall go for it and she'll set on fire and burn the weapons both the Shields and the buffers the bows and the arrows and stays and the spirits and they should burn them with fire seven years we just picked up seven years verse 10. and you say well how do you know this is right from us chapter 39 now don't get massively confused there you know we don't have them kind of Shields and bucklers and bows and arrows and and staves you know let's change it over to uniforms and and and uh Bazookas and and all kinds of things like that okay right you know Ezekiel when he went and saw what the wheels in the middle of the wheel and he's so far out of heaven nuclear stuff falling but he could call it fire out of Heaven name and saw chariots Jocelyn in the streets running like lightning Buicks and Oldsmobiles run up down the highway with lights on man why could he call it chariots right I throw it in you terrible they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any then they're cut down any out of the forest where they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoil to him and Rob those that robbed them says the Lord God and he shall come to pass that I will give unto God a place there of graves in Israel the valley of passengers on the east of the sea and they shall stop the no no it's not the passengers in other words everything gets the stinking all right yeah you know you get it and they there are they shall bury God in his multitude and they shall call it the value I'm a God can make August Russian right coming down come on seven months your house of Israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land yeah all of the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a Renown the day that I shall that I shall be glorified saith the Lord and they shall sever out out men of continual employment passion through the land of bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the Earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months until they served we got seven years seven months be like Wade was saying up there we think of Armageddon it means termination of forces when we just thank Armageddon that it's going to be standard Bloom we just burned everything is what we're showing it don't go Glenn Armageddon can be a long time it could be handy for a while one bomb ain't gonna blow us to pieces to prove that but setting them off I turn the desert didn't belong didn't do it they proved it in Japan two of them didn't launch the pieces it only blow the city to Pieces right when we go out of here fire bombs is going to be falling on everybody right anybody's got anything left gonna fire them when Israel finds out the natural nation of Israel right there when they find out that Armageddon that they've missed this thing they say now we don't worry about our enemy we got the Samson effect yep you know what the Samson effect was Samson died with his enemy when he pulled them down we can take them down with our own bombs right and destroy everything now the Israel gets their message right here right that's really 144 000 come in then here is this a cleansing every land that's all I'm trying to describe to you and then we'll read a little all right too much information not enough time all right jump we'll try to scatter uh don't go go to 37 11 36 because that's Jacob's trouble the tribulation is three tonight just three and a half years through the period of tribulation it's only three and a half years right here that's Jacob's trouble this is not Jacob's trouble no all right do you know you ever even thought about it the 144 000 that are killed you know who's gonna kill the Jews the literal Jew dad thinks he's right he's going to kill the 144 000 of the wrong people when they go in there and tell them don't you start none of this Temple back Jesus is the temple amen print out here they're going to preach and then finally going to be killed the Bible says two witnesses be killed 144 000 be killed men are

upon right Israel and a natural not Israel at 144 000 their tribulation is here all right then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroyed all things and then the bride returns back in with a groom

messages of Revelations 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the kingdom is at hand now watch the kingdom the millennium yep our kingdom is here the baptism of the Holy Ghost man the kingdom is at hand right here in the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth that's right the witness is going to preach the kingdom is at hand the Millennium is a kingdom to Israel we don't have time to cover it I got 10 minutes okay the kingdom is to be set up the time lies three and a half years of Daniel's 70th week promise to the Jews where it's going to be said this is going to cleanse it and that's going to be it that it brought around never talked seven years tribulation he talked to realize and he taught the cleansing of the world that's why I put D or put Great Tribulation period this is the Tribulation that falls upon natural Israel and it falls upon the 144 000 the slipping virgins and things here are killed then these people natural Israel when they see the Covenant is broke here and they see that man of seeing what he's done look around and said the Obama had to Rome and paraphrases but he said Obama hit straight to Rome because they'll see they missed it this is a cleansing getting ready to go into the Millennium amen Sydney weeks was determined upon thy people upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression Daniel 9 24. make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everybody some Bryson we're able to bring these out today I'm only going to build the last one because you'll see that six of them three oh let's see four five and six is in the Millennium right he brings in Everlasting righteousness but around says Satan is seal for a thousand years All I'm gonna deal with is one thing I'm doing pretty good look at the next one remember a minute ago look at number 40. you remember a minute ago we talked about the temple being built a Temple's built's got to be anointed amen every Temple has got to be Anointed with Bill even they re-anointed or how you want to say are redone the things in the rebuildings of the temple you know right all right look what he said paragraph 120. the sixth full purpose to be able to visit today anointing anointing that Temple for the millennial Reign right I know it's in Leviticus Now watch how it was dedicated to the business and we'll go back to the event because we find out Moses anointing the temple and going on through all right go to the next this is America 141 pull it up you know you can see that's tied with the temple now I came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not thy holy place would anoint the most holy place the Millennium Temple not a person right and we noticed that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that descends out of God from heaven got out of heaven holy place the Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon us your natural now here's your spiritual and the anointing will be up on the New Jerusalem that sends us from going out of Heaven prepared as a brother going for her husband the anointing will be upon them we are the anointing to the temple amen that's right we come back in Revelations 19. right we go up in Revelations 4 1 come back in 19 as the anointing to the temple amen what's going to happen in that period of time here this two witnesses will go up 144 000 go to Cleansing of the land the Jews will precede us here you see how many I don't know I know the 144 000 is coming but they're going to build a millennium Temple and I quote again not to offer sacrifices get that out of your mind Jesus Christ is our sacrifice but it'll be there to show it a temple to show it amen that we can go into that Temple right and we can worship the real God of the temple amen the Bible says the lamb will be not amen it's not dealing with trying to have times and dates and all it's a cleansing of the land getting ready and in the millennial rain comes they precede us here and build a temple now here's a question that would ask me you know but right now we're going to be going to match up right here three and a half here we're going to match up it's only three and a half years then we got to come back to Millennium but I just proved to you could be seven years whether you believe it or not it just went that far sure 1300 something days even up to seven years in the millennium we ride back after the temple is finished amen because we're the New Jerusalem you did you listen here's the city here's the building it is the New Jerusalem because it's what it's called but this New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven John John described the city and told it to ride he described the ride College of City read revelation 21-22 that's right well that's how close we are we ride back into the millennium it's not a seven year period of time like we're looking at it it's a getting ready for the millennium like I said the brothers asked me a question I thought we're just gonna be up for three and a half years of marriage supper and I just asked a simple question let me find somebody who won't get offended for me evening y'all got married in the church today right and you all had a wedding shepherdy we have a move here after so it doesn't matter over there they go back and forth you had a wedding supper didn't you and you know why you disappeared right and you got in the car and drove oh right with the bells hanging on the back and the cans of cloth and nobody didn't see you for a quite a while unless you'd like me and my wife all we could do is run up the motel and come back home good afford it I'm talking about people that can't afford to drink into it you see one darling man

these is but around he uses it he said 70 weeks equals seven years energy powerful way to get this afternoon 70 weeks equals seven years remember it was a parable right this of time is a parable oh three and a half years of promises Ministry in three and a half years of Jesus right yeah which is seven years I wrote a random eye to the seals broke I'll give you three quotes of it said 70 weeks equals seven years never did run around them anywhere I challenge you to find it never preached 490 years to Israel except in the message of the Daniel 78. were they thinking we're so massively confused he said the Lord put it on his pen what do they think well it's got to be over here it's 70 weeks equals seven years of Ministry of Jesus Christ right here right do they tapped it but the greatest of all times is Rose Redemption is a type of the Redemption of right right which one do we get this ministry or this ministry all right he said well we got to get this because we're done going over there now I can go back Williamson and preach because you see what them two prophets preach right there there's Seven Seals to Israel so we get this three and a half years Ministry and then we understand by prophecy what they will get all right until we get it all right amen so depend on coming stay in three hours may not be a joke that might be true I hope we're trying to explain it amen simple terminologies right amen how's the entire Bible together you said well I don't see how it's important well it's important to understand Redemption that's important all right is it
