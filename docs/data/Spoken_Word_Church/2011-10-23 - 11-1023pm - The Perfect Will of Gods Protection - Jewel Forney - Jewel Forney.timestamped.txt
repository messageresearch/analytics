[11:37] chapter Proverbs the 18th chapter
[11:43] Proverbs and I want to read one verse

[11:48] 10 and it says the name of the Lord is a
[11:52] strong tower
[11:55] amen the righteous run into it and is
[12:00] saved

[12:34] amen Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[12:38] come thy will be done in earth that's it

[13:39] service into your hands in Jesus Christ
[13:42] name we pray amen yes Lord maybe SE it
[13:46] one moment
[13:57] am praise God thank you Lord for the
[13:59] reading of the word of God this evening
[14:01] amen I tell from the scripture here in
[14:04] in the Book of Proverbs it says the name
[14:08] of the Lord is a strong tower and the
[14:12] righteous
[14:13] run in other words you got to be in a
[14:16] hurry in other words you can't be
[14:18] slopping around you got to run don't
[14:21] when people get something they excited
[14:22] you see a man running you know something
[14:25] is going on the name of the Lord is SC
[14:28] out and the rightous run into it and
[14:30] they are save and then I tell from here
[14:33] I tell
[14:34] from uh St Matthew 6 and
[14:38] um verse 10 is what I want to put my
[14:41] focus on thy kingdom come thy will be
[14:46] done in that's if you notice not on in
[14:51] Earth that's right as it is in heaven
[14:53] amen and I'm going to draw from that
[14:55] title of that topic uh that scripture
[14:59] verse the perfect will of God protection
[15:02] right and I took the I took this thought
[15:05] because I
[15:06] realized
[15:08] everybody want to feel the sense of
[15:11] being sense of security right yeah when
[15:14] a man when a man want to know that he's
[15:19] protected under God protection and my
[15:23] theme is God will and only only way that
[15:27] a man is going to be certain that he's
[15:30] under God protection he must have faith
[15:34] and understanding that he's in God will
[15:37] and if we understand God will is his
[15:40] word we we all are clear that but I want
[15:43] to look at the natural will as we begin
[15:46] to hear protection
[15:49] means to God or defend against harm or
[15:55] danger it means a shield protection mean
[15:58] to God a defend against harm a danger a
[16:01] shield everybody want protection in this
[16:05] Edge you need
[16:07] insurance you know we know we got
[16:09] insurance but don't be don't I told
[16:11] Brother you know people lot in the
[16:13] message they teach him not to get
[16:14] insurance but the point of it is they
[16:17] where the Rapture going to take place
[16:18] this this say if you die before the
[16:20] Rapture take place right then you got
[16:22] some problems because somebody going to
[16:24] have to put you in the grave right so
[16:26] you know in the me I found out sometime
[16:29] at church we burn a lot of people and
[16:31] then when they die they send to church I
[16:33] want you to pay this Buri your bill all
[16:35] you need to do is get you insurance
[16:37] right that's right I mean don't don't do
[16:39] you know you know this well you know
[16:41] everybody taugh these things and and
[16:43] we've been out of bouncing these things
[16:45] and so people that normally they get
[16:47] away from insurance because they feel
[16:49] like well the diretion take place I
[16:51] ain't going to have to worry about it
[16:52] well if it don't take place somebody
[16:54] going have to worry about your B exactly
[16:56] so you know Insurance you can you can
[16:58] save whoever left behind a lot of
[17:01] trouble by having insurance so he begin
[17:04] to realize and all the storms and and
[17:07] then things is going on in the world
[17:09] today we need insurance right I just had
[17:12] a house that got damaged it had a
[17:15] hellstone come down held by the side of
[17:18] a golf ball busting my roof busting some
[17:21] of my side and I think God I had
[17:23] Insurance because I was able to get my
[17:25] RO done and get my house side so if pays
[17:30] the in the natural to have insurance
[17:33] right and it pays that it gives you a
[17:36] sense of security to know that you are
[17:39] under a protection plan so we begin to
[17:42] look good so I begin to look at God's
[17:45] will of protection and we realize here
[17:48] the reason a person make a will is just
[17:51] to keep down confusion right that's
[17:53] right let me read here in the natural
[17:55] what a will is a will and then it it
[17:59] reads like this a legal paper in which a
[18:03] person tells what should be done with
[18:08] his or her money and property after the
[18:12] person dies right that's a natural will
[18:16] a legal paper in which a person tell
[18:18] what should be done with with you done
[18:22] what shall be done with her or her money
[18:25] a property after the person dies right
[18:28] right in other word a will is made to to
[18:31] keep down confusion right cuz every if
[18:35] if if you notice here when a person dies
[18:38] the family getting confused in everybody
[18:40] begin to fight everybody begin to say
[18:43] what they going to leave me yeah yeah a
[18:47] will is dependent
[18:48] on and not what you think about it or
[18:51] not what I think about is what the
[18:53] person had in his mind about you right
[18:55] right so when the person make out a will
[18:57] the reason he's the will he got you in
[19:00] his mind and he putting you down for
[19:03] whatever property he want you to have
[19:05] and whatever now you know if you're rich
[19:08] everybody going to come to your will
[19:10] yeah maybe your 14 cousin he show up you
[19:13] ain't seen him in 20 years here he go
[19:16] right and now all of a sudden you become
[19:17] his favorite cousin yeah Hallelujah all
[19:20] man of my favorite cousin another word
[19:22] but in other words so everybody but it
[19:25] don't matter it don't matter how many
[19:28] people come to the will a will is only
[19:31] read by somebody that's in authority to
[19:34] read it exactly right I was going to
[19:36] make out one and me and my wife were
[19:38] talking to a a lawyer and he was telling
[19:41] me what the processes I need to do so he
[19:44] can write it up how why because it got
[19:46] to have it got to it got to be
[19:47] recognized by an authority how you know
[19:50] anybody can write a piece of paper say I
[19:52] want you to do this how they how they
[19:54] got to be wrot by somebody they got a
[19:55] seal on it how they didn't know that
[19:58] this is what I'm done with
[20:00] it right and I find out a will is
[20:03] something as I travel through the
[20:06] through the country one thing I had
[20:09] never experienced i' have been many
[20:11] places at many tables I had never went
[20:14] to a table and sat down to eat and
[20:17] somebody had a wheel sitting on the
[20:20] table something I had never experienced
[20:23] no matter of fact I ain't never even
[20:24] seen nobody that had a will that never
[20:27] experienced ever picking up that oh this
[20:29] is Brother Sam will by get in the office
[20:32] yeah you don't you just don't find
[20:34] Wheels laying around the
[20:36] table in a bookshelf when you find a
[20:39] wheel when a man write a wheel he puts
[20:41] it away in a secret place right H
[20:45] somewhere that nobody don't know where
[20:47] they right yes and we here and then
[20:49] always kept in some type of Earthly
[20:52] vessel in somewhere that nobody can't
[20:55] find out what's going on Amen and number
[20:58] three about a
[20:59] will only way that you can be recognized
[21:02] on the will is that will must call you
[21:06] by name right amen anybody can show up
[21:09] with claims and say well he gave me this
[21:12] but the reason how you keep down the
[21:14] confusion when the whe is read it calls
[21:17] you by name and tell you what you
[21:19] got that's that's that's in the natural
[21:22] and so we begin to look here and I begin
[21:24] to look here I see God and we want to
[21:26] talk about God's will and we realize
[21:29] that God got a will and if God had a
[21:32] will he must put it in a vessel that's
[21:36] right and going be kept in a secret
[21:37] place Hallelujah he can't let this will
[21:40] be handed down and man get his hand on
[21:42] his will Hallelujah when Adam fell the
[21:45] will went back to God right because he
[21:48] said the legal exract the will cuz every
[21:51] name that was going to be there was on
[21:52] that actra and when Adam fell it went
[21:55] back into the hands of almighty God and
[21:58] nobody didn't know what was on the wheel
[21:59] no Hall so God took this wheel and he
[22:03] put it in a vessel right because the
[22:05] wheel must be kept in the Earthly V
[22:07] that's right let's see where he put
[22:08] itday Let us look at St John St John one
[22:16] right say John
[22:22] one turn in for a second St John one
[22:25] look and see what God put this whe cuz
[22:28] CU it got to be kept in a secret place
[22:30] that's right yeah and it says
[22:33] here I'm going begin
[22:36] reading at the at the 13 verse St John 1
[22:40] verse
[22:41] 13 it
[22:43] says which were born not of what blood
[22:48] not of the will of the what flesh not of
[22:51] the will of who man but a w go right and
[22:55] the Word was made what and DW amongst us
[22:59] and we beheld his glory and the glory as
[23:02] of the only begotten of the father full
[23:05] of grace and truth what did God put his
[23:07] will he put his will in the Earthly
[23:10] vessel called
[23:12] Jesus now you want to realize here so if
[23:15] God put Jesus in his will in Earthly
[23:18] vessel so when he came the thing that he
[23:22] had to come to do is reveal what's on
[23:25] God's will right yep absolutely so if
[23:28] you notice here if you never look at it
[23:30] this way that's why Jesus had no claims
[23:34] of coming on his own right you about
[23:38] this Jesus didn't never come to say I
[23:40] come to show you this way I come to do
[23:42] this he never come to claim his will he
[23:45] said I've come not to do my own will but
[23:49] the will of him to S me why because he
[23:51] was his house in the father as well in
[23:54] other words in other words he said he
[23:56] said St 5:30 I I seek not my own will so
[24:01] in other words he did not come to reveal
[24:04] what was on the Earthly his Earthly with
[24:06] you he come to reveal what was in God
[24:09] mind so we see his will and we begin to
[24:12] go here look here and that what made
[24:13] Jesus that what gave Jesus power over
[24:16] every every enemy that what gave Jesus
[24:18] power over every devil because he did
[24:20] not come to do his own will he came to
[24:23] do the will of him that sent him H he
[24:26] came to express what was on inside of
[24:29] him God will right that's right and I
[24:32] begin to look here I read this morning
[24:35] Satan the will we've been a fight
[24:38] against Wills yeah and I read that isai
[24:41] this morning the batt B is Wills yeah
[24:46] Satan said I will yeah if you know the
[24:48] Satan terminology I will Jesus says thy
[24:53] will right Hallelujah cuz he didn't come
[24:55] to do his own will right he did not come
[24:57] to I didn't come to reveal I didn't come
[25:00] to express flesh I come to express the
[25:04] word the Supernatural Part why told you
[25:07] Peter flesh and blind never revealed
[25:09] this right because if he did he didn't
[25:12] want him to look his flesh he said but
[25:14] Flesh and Blood never gave you this
[25:16] Revelation but the the father it was his
[25:20] will for you to be there why because you
[25:22] was already on the book H so his will
[25:25] was I didn't come to do it in my flesh I
[25:28] come to express the Revelation on
[25:31] inside this what Jesus says here in his
[25:33] own word what Paul said have no cidence
[25:36] In the Flesh right that's right H in
[25:39] other words so Jesus didn't put
[25:40] confidence in he he had no flesh and
[25:43] didn't have no sin but he still got us
[25:45] to look to the he still got us look to
[25:48] the supernatural the spiritual
[25:50] Revelation because the devil cannot imp
[25:52] personate
[25:54] that begin to look at begin to look at
[25:56] the will and and as we begin to go
[26:00] here and we we just talking about a whe
[26:03] for a few minutes so his job was to
[26:06] express the father's will Satan job was
[26:09] to get Jesus to Le the father will and
[26:14] accept the will on earth right if you
[26:17] notice it say John 4 that why he car
[26:19] Jesus up and he said Jesus if you would
[26:22] fall down and worship me I will how you
[26:26] going to you thought about this how's
[26:28] Satan going to give Jesus something that
[26:30] he stole Jesus is not going to be guilty
[26:33] of receiving stolen goods how he didn't
[26:36] hold nothing on her so he could give it
[26:38] to her I give you this it was stolen
[26:40] goods he's a thief y he's a li so he was
[26:45] trying to get Jesus something that he
[26:47] done stole from him right Jesus said he
[26:51] ain't going to accept that he said I
[26:53] didn't come to do that I didn't come I
[26:54] didn't come to receive stolen goods hu I
[26:57] come to do the will of the father how do
[26:59] I come to worship God how do he did not
[27:02] come to to make a bargain with the devil
[27:04] I do this and I do that if you did he
[27:06] wanted Jesus to make him God right he
[27:11] wanted Jesus to come down and worship
[27:13] him so he could become the god of this
[27:15] evil age and if he would have come that
[27:18] Jesus would have fell down and worshiped
[27:20] the devil he would have made the dev of
[27:22] God and every time you say you were sick
[27:25] you have a right to say you were sick
[27:26] because sickness would have been a
[27:28] because Jesus would have gave it to
[27:30] every time you would have say I am
[27:32] depressed I'm going through depression
[27:34] you would you had a right to say that
[27:36] because Jesus would have made him God
[27:38] but Jesus I'm not going to make you God
[27:40] I'll Worship the Lord thy God and him
[27:42] only shall I serve so you have no right
[27:44] to talk about s right amen only right
[27:48] you got to talk about thy will be done
[27:50] Lord hallelujah so we begin to
[27:53] go so as I begin to look at this thing a
[27:56] little closer we realize here that
[27:58] that's what it's all been about it's
[27:59] been about God's will how and God's will
[28:03] is out a will how you know you on the
[28:06] will you must have the ability to hear
[28:10] your name right amen if you if you if
[28:13] you don't understand and other words
[28:15] Jesus here Jesus come to his disciples
[28:18] and he says here and Jesus begin to
[28:20] speak to them and he said eat my flesh
[28:22] and drink my blood Hallelujah the Bible
[28:24] says here they begin to look at
[28:26] themselves they said this is a hard say
[28:28] who can hear it so they were dealing
[28:30] with the who could hear this say how did
[28:33] we begin to go on and we look her who
[28:35] could hear this say h didn't they you
[28:37] know Jesus turns around and says to them
[28:41] H and you see the son of man they s that
[28:43] way com how the Bible say they walked
[28:46] away right St John
[28:50] 666 he took them all of the Beast he
[28:52] scra the name up the because they never
[28:54] walk no more with him and the turn from
[28:57] light is to walk in the Darkness so did
[28:59] Jesus turn around to his 12 said will
[29:01] you also go Hallelujah will you also go
[29:04] if you know that Judas was there but
[29:06] Judah was not on the whe How Judah would
[29:08] have been on the wheel the devil
[29:10] couldn't have never took Judas from God
[29:13] hallelujah so here he was Jesus said to
[29:15] them have not I chosen you have not I
[29:18] chosen you 12 and one of you not on the
[29:21] whe right right so we begin to go here
[29:24] we begin look into his will and then we
[29:26] begin to realize here
[29:28] as he begin to go and express himself
[29:31] the father's will in Christ so we
[29:33] realize here what is his will his will
[29:35] is that the end of the word you have the
[29:38] ability to hear his voice if you notice
[29:40] sure when God came to k k could never
[29:45] hear the word right when Jesus spoke the
[29:49] K say if you do this you'll be accepted
[29:53] the word should have put in the seed
[29:56] right but then he turned around and the
[29:59] church he said none SE can be quicked so
[30:02] when the word spoke the C it meant
[30:05] nothing he was not on the wheel and if
[30:09] you on the wheel that mean there no
[30:12] accident right that mean that if God put
[30:15] you on the whe that mean that God had
[30:17] you in his mind and that why the devil
[30:19] can never steal you from God right the
[30:22] devil would have t Peter he said he
[30:23] desired to see you Peter he got he want
[30:26] you Peter but I for you hallah why I had
[30:30] you on my mind and the devil can never
[30:32] take you from this will H so when God
[30:34] make a will he must declare the will
[30:38] right cuz we wouldn't have how would you
[30:40] have confidence in God if you didn't
[30:42] have confidence that when God saved me
[30:45] he started this thing he was going to
[30:46] keep me to the end that's right that's
[30:49] right our cism build on it that God
[30:52] cannot lie once he say something so if
[30:56] we we have a right to challenge the word
[30:59] after God say something if God lose
[31:02] somebody that's on the wheel he's no
[31:04] longer God that's
[31:07] right some people he had to take off the
[31:09] Earth early right right because they
[31:12] were disobedient but God see to it that
[31:15] they wouldn't be lost he they short God
[31:17] moved them out the Earth so it wouldn't
[31:19] be a stumbling block but God had to see
[31:22] to it because when God put his word up
[31:25] he declared his word this cannot happen
[31:28] happen right how you know I think from
[31:31] St John
[31:33] 10 John 10 let this here I'm going show
[31:37] you how important this is this
[31:41] will St John
[31:45] 10 and I want to begin
[31:49] reading St John 10 and I want to begin
[31:52] reading at verse
[31:54] 26 watch it right here when he speak the
[31:58] evidence is he says but ye believe
[32:03] not because ye are not of my what she
[32:08] sheep as I have said unto you in other
[32:11] word what was he doing he knew that
[32:14] sheep would hear the voice he says and
[32:19] no he said my sheep hear
[32:22] what and I know them and they follow me
[32:26] right and I give to them
[32:29] i y give unto them eternal life right
[32:32] and they shall never what neither shall
[32:35] any man pluck them out of my hand for my
[32:38] Father which gave them is greater is
[32:41] greater than all yeah and no man is able
[32:46] to pluck them out of my father's hand I
[32:50] am my father all one I am the mystery of
[32:55] God's will revealed right right
[32:57] Hallelujah so no man is able to pluck
[33:01] them out of my father's hand my she hear
[33:04] my voice and no man is able to pluck
[33:07] them out of my father's head all that
[33:09] the father's give me will come how
[33:12] nobody can come unto me except it was
[33:14] given to my father why because every man
[33:16] that come it's no accident you come
[33:19] right the reason you come he had you on
[33:22] the wheel H you don't think you just
[33:24] stumbl through life and out of the
[33:26] thousands of people you come to God and
[33:28] all of on you say and you say oh I made
[33:30] my mind up and I done that no you didn't
[33:32] make your mind up God made his mind
[33:36] up so if God declar I should not lose
[33:40] one that mean that God put his word to
[33:43] exate right and if God lose a Son of God
[33:47] if he lose one son he's no longer God
[33:50] right hall if God lose one person that
[33:53] God put on his will it discredit his
[33:55] whole thing to being God so God going to
[33:58] see to it that ever son make it so I I
[34:02] begin to look girl so if you remember so
[34:05] Jesus never did nothing except he looked
[34:08] at the will first that why when he got
[34:11] up to go to Samaritan that morning if
[34:13] you notice him what Jesus said he gets
[34:15] to go to Samaritan he just didn't get a
[34:17] he just didn't get a you know how we get
[34:19] a Zeal I got a Zeal to go down now H he
[34:21] got up he said I have need to go down
[34:24] there what was the need was somebody was
[34:27] going to will and when that person
[34:29] crossed the path with him glory it was
[34:33] not an accident she crossed his path
[34:36] when this lady this this protitute lady
[34:38] crossed his path what made him respond
[34:41] she had the same life right she had
[34:44] representation so here he goes he goes
[34:47] down to he goes down to the well and he
[34:49] says I have need to go to Samar what was
[34:51] he looking at he was looking at the
[34:53] wheel he said there's a little lady
[34:55] going to come down there and her name is
[34:57] there y her body is messed up her spirit
[35:00] is messed up but her soul came from God
[35:04] and I got to go down there and let her
[35:05] know what she come from right H so what
[35:07] he do he goes down to Samaritan if you
[35:11] notice here first off he shouldn't had
[35:13] him been down now
[35:16] right he shouldn't have been he
[35:18] shouldn't have went down to Samar that
[35:20] was on the south side of town he didn't
[35:22] need to be down there but he said I have
[35:24] need to go down there right so he go
[35:27] down to
[35:28] against just you if you notice here that
[35:30] why brother brand would react in ways
[35:33] that throw people's off hone when
[35:34] brother BR was down there and and and I
[35:36] think I think it was in uh Memphis
[35:38] Tennessee and one them play that old
[35:40] blind color man were praying and they
[35:42] would telling brother brand because
[35:43] there was segregation that that and then
[35:45] brother you get our pre this man you
[35:47] going start a war brother said I don't
[35:50] care what I start he think God called me
[35:52] to bre and he had to obey the will he
[35:55] come to do what it ain't got nothing to
[35:57] do with Flesh and Blood it got something
[35:59] to do with finding the mind of God
[36:01] that's rightly yes sir so he go down to
[36:04] SMY and he stands by the well at the
[36:08] hour that nobody else didn't want to be
[36:09] identified with because this is the hour
[36:11] that the unclean women's come down yeah
[36:13] you know most people we all going down
[36:17] you know God will or not I'm not going
[36:19] to be down there with all them
[36:20] prostitutes coming down Jesus said I got
[36:23] to do the father's will I better leave
[36:25] my critic disciples back there cuz won
[36:28] understand this yeah right so he go down
[36:30] he didn't care none of
[36:32] them so he stand by the well and he
[36:35] waited to these prostitutes start to
[36:37] come I'm just paraphrasing for a few
[36:39] minute maybe one come got some water and
[36:42] she probably looked at him what he doing
[36:44] down here you don't got nothing to do
[36:47] with them Jews yeah she drops a bucket
[36:49] she go get some water she go back she
[36:51] roll the eyes and Jesus Jesus didn't
[36:52] have say word another prostitute come by
[36:55] just say paraphrase she goes to P she
[36:59] look at this Jesus standing he better
[37:01] get out of here for
[37:04] dark she Dr up fck she come at him but
[37:08] here come here come a
[37:10] prostitute that had representation right
[37:14] so when she come in contact with God he
[37:17] knows his sheep he said I know
[37:19] them this woman was no I surprise to
[37:22] Jesus right he knew exactly who she was
[37:26] so when she crossed her was two uniped
[37:29] men right something took place in his
[37:32] spirit and Jesus knew that was the one
[37:34] Hallelujah something when she Flash
[37:36] before him he knew that she was the one
[37:38] so he never spoke to none of the rest of
[37:40] them right right as soon as she goes to
[37:43] the well and drop her Bucky
[37:46] down Jesus asked her a question woman
[37:50] give me a drink
[37:51] right now just thing is first of all she
[37:55] had a problem with him standing there
[37:56] yeah she might have been a prostitute
[37:58] but she wasn't stupid that long yeah she
[38:00] had to go out the Jew that was
[38:02] out you know that was you know she nak
[38:06] man this man what is he doing down here
[38:08] she dropped up bucket Jesus speak to her
[38:10] he said woman give me a drink yeah and
[38:14] she turned around look at who you
[38:15] talking to me she said yeah talking to
[38:18] you give me a drink what did she do
[38:20] immediately she start to explain you
[38:22] down here at this well you got nothing
[38:25] to draw with the well is deep why you
[38:28] asking me of a drink mhm so if you
[38:31] notice this the most decent thing she
[38:33] could have did the most common thing to
[38:36] do is say
[38:38] Jesus I dropped my water bucket you need
[38:41] a drink drink for my bucket you know why
[38:44] she didn't do that cuz she didn't want
[38:46] no Jew putting his lip on her
[38:48] [Music]
[38:49] bucket she Jesus do how come down and
[38:55] come out she was willing for drun out of
[38:57] her bucket right this woman didn't want
[39:00] that Jew drun it out of her bucket but
[39:02] once the Holy Ghost come it don't matter
[39:04] about the place he come to
[39:07] tell so he go then he begin to go on and
[39:10] why because Jesus had to save his woman
[39:14] because she was on the wheel how I
[39:16] didn't care how bad her life was how bad
[39:18] she was mixed up his job was she had
[39:21] eternal life right here she had to
[39:23] recognize it right so then he goes on he
[39:27] talks Jesus says to this woman as the
[39:30] conversation go if you know who I am you
[39:33] know who I am you would ask me of a
[39:35] drein and I will give you water that you
[39:37] wouldn't have to come around and draw no
[39:39] more when she responded watch her
[39:41] respond when did she get this Revelation
[39:44] give me all this water right something
[39:46] on the inside her say I need this water
[39:49] give me all this water that I don't have
[39:50] to thirst and come at this well and draw
[39:52] them up then Jesus
[39:55] stops and he begin to deal with her now
[39:58] right because he sees the condition she
[40:00] in so what did he ask you he said go get
[40:03] your husband right in other words go get
[40:07] your husband and this woman turned
[40:09] around say I ain't got no
[40:14] church I've been going to this church
[40:16] I've been I I'm on the internet how I I
[40:20] play tapes yeah hallah I don't go to
[40:23] church I don't got no headship I'll do
[40:26] my own thing and I can go what I want to
[40:28] do I'm not under nobody headship how did
[40:31] Jesus say now you telling the truth you
[40:33] been to church to church and that's
[40:38] not and then she say she recognizing the
[40:42] word calling her so what did she say h
[40:45] Lord the word begin to go on and on then
[40:48] Jesus begin to talk to this woman and
[40:50] all of a sudden as they begin to go this
[40:52] conversation the demons begin to leave
[40:54] her and they said you know she get
[40:56] released
[40:58] I don't care where you go you start
[41:01] talking to anybody y they can be
[41:03] drinking a pack of six Buck wises yeah
[41:06] soon you mention Jesus that religious
[41:08] spirit po up y b Wiis ain't leaving but
[41:12] the religious your H I was in a I was in
[41:15] a convenience store I told a while back
[41:17] and a man was telling a real dirty joke
[41:21] real dirty joke so I was standing there
[41:24] and this guy told this real dirty joke
[41:27] you people buying stuff he just told
[41:29] everybody laughing but
[41:31] me I didn't think the joke was
[41:34] funny and uh the guy looked over at
[41:38] me and he said what do you
[41:41] do I said I'm going preach he said
[41:44] praise the
[41:52] Lord oh yeah I'm try to think where did
[41:54] that come from me but that's just the
[41:57] way it
[41:57] Jesus told this woman all of sudden she
[42:00] get Religion she in this condition how
[42:04] this well well you should have been
[42:06] obeying you would have been in the
[42:07] condition you H but that religious
[42:10] spirit come in what why did she get
[42:12] religious people this is what Revelation
[42:14] L that the reason she got religious that
[42:16] religious demon was trying not to let
[42:18] her go right exactly if he hold her back
[42:22] under the truition of her father she
[42:24] would accept the word like i s he hold
[42:27] the
[42:29] back the religious spirit of our fathers
[42:32] been as well you said to Jerusalem he
[42:35] wouldn't want to let go her but Jesus
[42:37] said I'm com to tear down your TR they
[42:40] coming a time that you was NE in
[42:42] Jerusalem not at this well what he doing
[42:44] he was doing away with the TR and as she
[42:47] received the word she was set free that
[42:49] demon left the woman told come
[42:53] man I to go here look here
[42:57] when God calls a person in the
[43:00] wheel Thee the thing that we had
[43:02] recognized yet that when God calls a man
[43:05] to the will he has the ability to hear
[43:08] God's voice right right and if if you
[43:11] cannot hear his voice then you got
[43:13] question is on there because a will when
[43:15] somebody call you in the wheel and then
[43:18] you go to read a will and they M around
[43:20] and says to you how I call you your
[43:24] daddy just left you $1 million
[43:28] it going to be a lot of shouting
[43:31] in I didn't even have to work for this I
[43:35] didn't label for it I didn't put no
[43:37] investment in it but my daddy had me on
[43:40] my mind he had me on his mind and he
[43:42] wrote in the whe to give me $1 million I
[43:45] am the happiest person in the world
[43:47] Hallelujah in other words that's what
[43:49] God did in his will I'm not going to
[43:51] give you one M I'm going to give you
[43:53] eternal life H I'm going be the happi
[43:56] people on this
[43:59] that's in the
[44:00] will in people it is
[44:04] today it's in this world today that God
[44:08] cannot in no circumstance lose the Son
[44:10] of God right amen he cannot blashe
[44:14] himself away no right right if he lose a
[44:17] Son of God then he's no longer God right
[44:19] right why Jesus even under unreasonable
[44:24] circumstances Jesus always SA know as
[44:27] his right absolutely and when they don't
[44:29] even seem like they can be saved he got
[44:31] ways to meet he got ways to save Son of
[44:34] God sometime you say how did this happen
[44:37] right here how did they how he save a
[44:39] Son of God how did he make how how did
[44:41] he get this person he called they Happ
[44:43] through life yeah right make sure that
[44:47] some way right we come across the word h
[44:50] look at here we go back we go to a
[44:52] natural genetics and we begin to run it
[44:54] down and you'll find out in your
[44:55] background just person was married to
[44:58] that person H this was an outlaw this
[45:00] right here he was a woman and this
[45:02] person was married to this person and
[45:04] this person here and all you go back
[45:06] through your family tree you find out it
[45:08] ain't even one re but all through that
[45:10] your G travel had to be
[45:13] join why did you die all the brother die
[45:17] but you kept coming you finally come on
[45:20] Earth had to be two people in meet right
[45:25] make up to make you because you have
[45:27] have a St way until you respond to God
[45:30] all the thousands of your brothers and
[45:32] sisters died in that message called one
[45:34] in a man all those SE went out they die
[45:36] but why didn't you die all down to the
[45:39] because God had you on the whe how God
[45:42] had a purpose for you that's why you he
[45:44] made a natural birth and more more
[45:47] mysterious than Sil birth
[45:50] exactly am we here by God perfect will Y
[45:55] and God had a plan for you H you born
[45:58] here God called you and put you together
[46:00] here H nothing could take your place H
[46:04] all all everybody all the seed that went
[46:07] down through here and just German
[46:09] through this Grand PR this Grand go back
[46:11] and look through your
[46:13] genetics you better leave that
[46:16] long you might leave that you might find
[46:18] something you don't want to know but
[46:20] here it is you know other words you know
[46:22] so we in other words that why we can't
[46:23] get our mind on our genetics Hall you
[46:26] can't get your mind on there all that
[46:28] you got toiz all I know I had to be
[46:31] there all the things I went through and
[46:34] I went this way and that way and all of
[46:36] a sudden God call
[46:38] up how you do that because when you hear
[46:41] the voice your body change right
[46:43] something start taking place right so in
[46:45] other words in other words some of you
[46:47] we shouldn't even be here we should have
[46:48] went straight to hell right amen hallah
[46:50] your bypass go straight to hell right
[46:53] amen H it ain't nothing that you done to
[46:55] make yourself good enough even not even
[46:56] to the point that you was looking for
[46:58] God yeah if God got you on the will it
[47:00] ain't you to find God it's God's purpose
[47:02] to find you H you ain't going down tell
[47:05] God I'm trying to buy you having you God
[47:08] but something on inside begin to go
[47:10] off that's the seed that's God that's
[47:12] the part that God put in you you might
[47:14] not understand that God had control of
[47:16] you when you didn't have
[47:18] control is the thing that is about his
[47:20] will so you begin to look here when you
[47:22] look at God will how look at right look
[47:24] at the condition Jesus deal with right
[47:26] right yeah if I was going to write a
[47:29] wheel you certainly ain't going to write
[47:31] it to that kid that's without smoking
[47:33] pot yeah you be try if you do you write
[47:36] a whe at the end of the day brother I
[47:39] want this in the whe When I die take
[47:41] this much money put him in a rehab
[47:45] right cuz you feel like this kid right
[47:47] here is out of control right H but when
[47:49] God rote a wheel H he took P that didn't
[47:52] even seem like they were fit for nothing
[47:54] Hall that's what he do he put people
[47:56] people didn't they see like they was
[47:58] worth nothing no earthly value how but
[48:00] he put them in the whe right and God
[48:03] going to see to it let they get sa out
[48:05] of all the prostitutes in that town
[48:07] right right the spies went to Rahab
[48:10] house exactly yeah out of all those
[48:12] prostitutes in the in that town God went
[48:15] to the right house the right number in
[48:18] the right place at the right time
[48:21] because she was on the wheel how because
[48:23] God had seen how you know she's on the
[48:24] wheel if you want read if she on the
[48:26] Wheel all you got to do pick up Hebrews
[48:27] 11 right she was in the will Hallelujah
[48:30] so if you want to see her name she was
[48:32] there Hallelujah so the will had to call
[48:34] her by name so here she was in Hebrews
[48:37] 11 Hallelujah we find
[48:39] r y how she get there yeah she was there
[48:44] all the time right she was there all the
[48:47] time but God had to get her to it he had
[48:50] to get her to the place to recognize
[48:51] what she was she would do all the
[48:53] prostitutes in the to God s the spies by
[48:56] r
[48:58] amen ra said I'm going to hide these
[49:01] gent H I heard about their testimony I
[49:05] hear about what they done how hear all
[49:08] I'm going to hide these men so ra the
[49:11] har didn't never change that title right
[49:14] still called
[49:16] Raab it might have been recognized on
[49:18] Earth Raab but it God mind she was a
[49:21] daughter Hallelujah she was a daughter
[49:23] of God so ra took them and hit him you
[49:26] know the story at the end of the day
[49:28] what did they tell Raab RAB I want you
[49:31] to put this scet clo down right and when
[49:34] we come through the land M we're going
[49:36] to destroy everything y but when I see
[49:39] that token y that Scarlet claw yes sir
[49:42] we're going to pass over
[49:44] you and I begin to look at her cuz the
[49:47] point of it was I don't know what people

[49:52] because everybody probably looking at
[49:54] RAB saying this dirty old she Ain up in
[49:57] a red screen Red Red Door woman and they
[50:00] talking joke about ra and everybody had
[50:02] everything against Rael they can find
[50:04] because she was not good enough how do
[50:06] everybody run by RAB how did rab did
[50:09] this and rab did that but I want you to
[50:11] notice here when Joshua and them came
[50:13] through the city the whole city fell
[50:15] flat everybody in the city died ra

[50:21] accusers so she didn't have nobody there

[50:31] accuser

[57:12] God you know I I got a lot I can go on
[57:15] it all but I want to say this this
[57:17] evening this a thought I want you to
[57:19] notice
[57:20] here
[57:22] predestination is based on God said my
[57:26] she hear my voice right right if God
[57:30] said that that somewhere in your
[57:33] Christian Journey you got to hear his
[57:35] voice right you that why you find
[57:38] peoples that you know that been going
[57:40] going going you wouldn't have thought
[57:41] they would never been saved even your
[57:43] own even in your own mind you erase them
[57:47] off you said I know that person ain't
[57:49] going to be there oh my I know that
[57:51] person ain't going to be there I I just
[57:53] can't see all the stuff they done and
[57:55] all of
[57:56] sudden amen amen you be say man I didn't
[58:00] even I remember one time I judged a girl
[58:03] and the spirit of Lord re my window I
[58:04] told her I apologize to her to I saw the
[58:07] girl come to church she was so immorally
[58:09] I said man and the brother was mared and
[58:13] he asked me he said brother je he said
[58:16] should I give her a chance I just drop
[58:21] her and I looked at the girl my first
[58:24] impression was out run
[58:28] but I'm glad I didn't tell him that amen
[58:31] I didn't say that I just thinking that
[58:32] when I saw her he said I said well son I
[58:35] said look at this I said God gave you a
[58:37] chance I said you've been involved with
[58:39] this girl for two or three years I said
[58:41] you need to give her a chance I said
[58:44] either she accepted or she rejected but
[58:46] you owe her you owe her to give her a
[58:48] chance right right and what he did now
[58:51] she the most holiest looking girl I ever
[58:53] saw right because somebody had to give
[58:57] so you don't know what it is you we we
[59:00] what we do we judge by the outside that
[59:02] why we got so many problems now how do
[59:04] we look at somebody that's spiritually
[59:06] ain't been behind the veil and you
[59:08] looking at her well that sister right
[59:09] there that brother right there he ain't
[59:11] going to make it you just let God worry
[59:13] about that you just keep preaching the
[59:16] word so let me go let me just use this
[59:20] let call
[59:21] here I just looked at Paul I might have
[59:25] told this more than once because Paul is
[59:28] a perfect example of somebody on the
[59:31] wheel right remember he said my sheep
[59:36] hear my voice so God have declared this
[59:39] so he was obligated for Paul to hear the
[59:42] voice right now you said brother Jew you
[59:45] said brother JW he was obligated that
[59:47] Paul would hear the voice so we we go
[59:51] here we realize here that we realize
[59:53] here Paul had did some things according
[59:56] to the word that Paul should have went
[59:58] stay to hell
[1:00:00] right if we would look at Paul in his
[1:00:03] natural standing yeah right Paul left no
[1:00:05] scripture to be saved on right because
[1:00:08] when he when Jesus said in the word
[1:00:11] touch not my
[1:00:12] anointing and do my prophets no harm
[1:00:15] right it's better for a meal Stone to be
[1:00:17] TI around your neck you thr it to the
[1:00:19] dev to see and Dr then touch one of my
[1:00:22] anointed yes Paul didn't only touch your
[1:00:24] anointed he the Son of God that was full
[1:00:27] of the Holy Ghost right exactly so he
[1:00:31] couldn't look at the scripture because
[1:00:32] the scripture already condemn him right
[1:00:35] he could not make it on his marriage no
[1:00:38] right that's right that why when you
[1:00:39] sang a ma of Grace you are not never
[1:00:41] sang A maor Grace for what you quit or
[1:00:43] what you done you ought to sing a major
[1:00:44] gra because God found you when you was
[1:00:46] unsaved right amen H when it look like
[1:00:48] you was going straight to hell that what
[1:00:50] made it Amazing Grace Hallelujah so so
[1:00:52] he was he did all the things and he
[1:00:54] would have went straight to hell
[1:00:56] right but here it
[1:00:58] was the Bible tells us before Jesus died
[1:01:02] he did something that we must catch in
[1:01:04] the
[1:01:05] Scripture it was important that Jesus
[1:01:08] react this way he looked at his
[1:01:11] disciples one day brother he said I'm
[1:01:13] going to give you power I'm going to
[1:01:15] empower you when the king Empower his
[1:01:20] son he takes the ring off his finger
[1:01:23] right he takes the ring off his finger
[1:01:26] and this King gives this he put this
[1:01:28] ring on his son and when he doing what
[1:01:31] is he doing he's empowering him right
[1:01:33] amen with his lordship right and
[1:01:36] whatever that son put on that when he
[1:01:38] take that ring and he put that symol
[1:01:40] there that mean it got to be CED out how
[1:01:43] before Jesus left he did one thing he
[1:01:46] empowered his sons right he said I'm
[1:01:49] going to tell what I'm going to do so
[1:01:51] I'm getting ready to leave but I'm going
[1:01:52] to empower you yeah I'm going to give
[1:01:55] you power whoever seeing you remit is
[1:01:58] remitted whoever seing you bound is
[1:02:00] bound I'm EMP power you Church H I'm not
[1:02:04] going to do it I'm giving you the power
[1:02:05] to do it he never gave that power
[1:02:09] Hallelujah he gave that power before he
[1:02:10] left right right
[1:02:13] exactly then after the Holy Ghost come y
[1:02:16] he empowered him yep cuz he couldn't
[1:02:18] give it to Peter at first Peter Still
[1:02:20] was on the other side of the fence right
[1:02:22] you know what I mean Peter man tell you
[1:02:26] what you doing man put this sword up
[1:02:28] what you doing boy you just cut this man
[1:02:30] off what till you get saved you can get
[1:02:32] some power but right now but you ain't
[1:02:35] ready for you been pull out 44
[1:02:37] shot you so you had to wait a little
[1:02:39] while but once they come once they went
[1:02:41] up in the upper room he empowered there
[1:02:43] and they had the power now how do he
[1:02:45] Empower them to do what to impart life
[1:02:48] right right whoever seen you remit
[1:02:51] they'll remit whoever see you bound this
[1:02:53] bow I'll give you power here right so he
[1:02:56] EMP powered them right so when Paul
[1:02:58] committed this CME mhm he s against the
[1:03:03] body Y where the Holy Ghost was leaveing
[1:03:07] no way according to the scripture just
[1:03:09] law when a king write a law it must be
[1:03:12] carried out right so Not only was he was
[1:03:16] bound the law was there to condemn him
[1:03:19] touch not my anointing and do my
[1:03:22] prophets no harm it's better for a
[1:03:24] millstone to be tler
[1:03:26] you throw to the dep
[1:03:28] ofch he stoned Stevenson y he was a
[1:03:33] murder and he should not have made it
[1:03:36] according to the human mind right right
[1:03:39] he should not have made it as he was
[1:03:41] there they was waiting for Paul he had
[1:03:43] the authority that said should we Stone
[1:03:46] him Saul Saul walks over there to him he
[1:03:49] looks at him sa should we do it Saul
[1:03:52] says kill right they took stones and
[1:03:57] they begin to Stone him at his
[1:03:59] consent he didn't pull the trigger he
[1:04:02] might as well pull the Trier right he
[1:04:04] held the coat and everything else he
[1:04:06] might well done it the blood was on him
[1:04:08] because he had the power to do he the
[1:04:09] power to let it go or not but he said
[1:04:12] kill him Hallelujah in word he was
[1:04:15] stoning this man H this man that full of
[1:04:17] the Holy Ghost Ste preaching the word to
[1:04:20] him had one convert out of all that
[1:04:22] preacher he did y that Paul Paul that's
[1:04:25] right right how did the word of God
[1:04:27] don't return vo how did he preach the
[1:04:30] word one person got sa Paul nobody else
[1:04:33] here to understand what was going on
[1:04:36] exactly and all of a sudden it was
[1:04:39] almost
[1:04:40] over but it was important that Stevenson
[1:04:43] react before he died because he realized
[1:04:47] he was dying right and at the end of the
[1:04:49] RO he got to say the right word how in
[1:04:52] the third pool is say the right word he
[1:04:55] had to the right word at the end of the
[1:04:56] day so at the end of the day he be to
[1:04:58] weak it down his body was getting weak
[1:05:00] he said I need just a little scre I'm
[1:05:02] getting ready cross over Jesus stands up
[1:05:05] just to scren him a little more yep and
[1:05:08] his last words was as he be to drop into
[1:05:10] death right he had to drop the charges
[1:05:13] against Paul he said father laid not
[1:05:15] this charge how did Paul would went the
[1:05:17] hell but the blood smoke how when he say
[1:05:20] Lord let notro he

[1:06:40] stone and then that white stone he would
[1:06:42] give to that man and when he give that
[1:06:45] white stone to that man that mean that
