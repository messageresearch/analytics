two languages - couch Arlen does he do mas see there could be in the house with Lord we understand like I said to be on service when it's time then said be Co turn it up just a little bit Josh so people can hear our brethren this is for brother Lewis's father and mother I think his sister doesn't have a problem probably got a problem listening to Lewis but as far as sisters usually no she's got she's got okay she's got better okay all right you know go interpret that there's no need okay all right well good to be in the house of Lord to do in this thing like I said sin you're doing good to be a Christian we wanted to say to Cristiano good to be standing where we're standing we would instead put out another stylist and while we're standing and I got a couple announcements I need to make I said scepters I know and see us on Wednesday night now Jim usually cleans the church on Tuesday to get to services in you're gonna you got cleaned either Tuesday or Thursday and what happens on Wednesday night is a lot of you parents so I'm talking to you with small children a lot of your children pull toys out in the Sunday School classes downstairs and don't put them back so you're responsible for your children your children I hope that's not grown-ups down there playing with those toys okay so so families with children needs to go through because this morning when Ana walked in her Sunday school class there was not just two or three toys there was twenty or thirty toys scattered all over the floor where some child had played with it Wednesday night and didn't put it back up so just just make sure you if your kids play with toys which they will so just have them put them back up on Wednesday all right that okay all right say ma'am also we need to remember sister - SOT she is in Trinidad she's coming back Wednesday I think so just remember her and in the island of Trinidad brother Stephen Julian everybody knows brother Steve remember his son got shot in the head while he passed away Thursday so talked to him on the phone just a few minutes ago talked to brother Joseph so he's okay but the I didn't understand it but the boy lives in New York and it was a road rage event in New York I've got the article in the back and they do have a suspect so they got out was fighting and got he got shot in the head so they do have a suspect in the case so remember brother Julian he seem to be okay but okay or not it's hard to lose a family member especially a son also by way of another announcement this picture here brother Joe Canada had this done for us so let's give him a great big hand and also brothers got one on his car alright so if anybody work the church is going to buy one per family for everyone in the church perb my brother Terrence that wasn't my choosing he said that so where he approved it one per family if you want to see the example look on the back of dad's car yes that's what it looks like right there it'll be a sticker you can put on the back of your back of your vehicle on your window it's one of those peel off stickers but if you look on brother Dale's Tahoe you'll see that that picture there but I really appreciate brother Joe Canada doing that for us and that that's not an update of Jesus but that's a version that we see where he came into the cloud and came down - who - a prophet but he also came to us Christ didn't just come to the Prophet he came to us hey man so just keep that in your prayers and now we will turn to i'ma say you don't Matthew 28:19 we've got a lot of people being baptized today so I close buddies
