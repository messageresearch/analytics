========================================

kind of to go alright alright last week we ended up talking about when Jesus met with Nicodemus Jesus met with Nicodemus and told them you know you cannot even see and seeing me and understand you cannot even understand the kingdom of God without you even being born again right and and Jesus brought that in that's so important you know for you too to be born again for you to understand the word and looking at something last night is interesting that Jesus he tells him and we can look over but he tells the disciples he says he says in different different times he says after he's given them a parable of some sort trying to teach him something he's given him to it he's preached to everybody reached the parable and he and then after the parable the disciples don't understand much and so they asked they asked Jesus may say Jesus tell us what this means that we don't understand and several times he replaced him he says blessed are you for it to you is given to know the mysteries of the King does run right to know now that's key because it was something we were talking about in regarding to a question that sister Trudy had asked last Sunday he said can a sinner get a revelation and what's interesting is that Jesus tells them isn't it it's given for you to know now you can have a knowledge but before you can become a before you get a new birth was because the disciples because Jesus then after it he explains to them what these what these parables meant but they really didn't get an under full understanding until that knew that that word they come alive until the new birth they experience on the Upper Room so there's many times and we'll go over in just a moment we'll read it you read the scripture but I thought that that was so very interesting because you can have a knowledge of this word again I got said last Sunday many we'll have had a knowledge of this message that God sent a prophet and and all these things they can really read the books and all that but that has nothing to do if you receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that's just you know me right something right and many people who have known something are still coming out they're leaving they say well this is what I'm going for now leaving the you know leaving the word you know and I call I say hop in the word leave the word no all right so how do you enter into this kingdom we talked about we've talked about what the kingdom is not right we talked about almost in your you're almost into the kingdom but not really in the kingdom right now we're gonna Behati enter into this kingdom or the question better yet is how does his kingdom enter into you and so brother Branham says here I like what he says here you are born into the kingdom of God how by the Holy Ghost that's God's witness he gives what is by the Word of God that we've passed from death unto life because we are in the kingdom of God and then another area he says no matter what it looks like here we don't look at what we see me look at what we do not see that's that's key is that right anyhow to see doesn't mean to look at the word see means to understand Jesus said except a man be born of water and spirit he cannot see the kingdom of God in other words he can't understand the kingdom of God until he's born again see you have to accept it by faith that's key you have to accept it by faith right down here that's why you're born again down here Ezra and then when he comes into you understand it that's the reason why that brother Dale was bringing something so key and if you were there listening to two two ones days ago I believe it was and I'd suggest you go back to in it go back and start listening to Lisa from the part where he's been speaking about this born-again series he was talking about faith faith is the substance right faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you can't see that faith that's the reason why you can't explain most of us can't explain our universe but we know is there we know it has happened but we can't go and tell it to everybody else we we can't explain it because it's all based by the word it's all through the word it's got to be it's got to be the foundation has to be the word you can't say you got the new birth because you shook the preachers hand or you or you did this no it's gotta be you got to hear the word first faith cometh by here and then here and and hearing the Word of God then it produced it could produce the new birth right you believe that wherever then it produces that new birth but that's so key because now I can't explain to you what happened to me in Columbia South America in 1999 I just know I had there was an experience that took place I didn't run I didn't shout I didn't I didn't scream I didn't make of a lot of noise I just know that something took place and from there a growth started taking place now it hasn't been easy but it's been worth that much it hasn't been easy and and I just remember and just this as a testimony I remember when I picked up the brother there in Columbia South America we went to his Columbia as Baptist gonna go pass out tracts to the family and and you know and then talk to the people on the streets and we just like good good old Baptist you know and and one of my mom's cousins had come into the message and she says he started explaining to us about what happened in the Garden of Eden that even Adam and Eve then eat no fruit it was a little act that took place and for that for a Baptist to hear something like that that is shocking I mean he just went straight to the point and that Cain was the son of the devil and all kinds of stuff he was new also but but he said well let's go talk to the pastor pastor talk to us and he just discussed to us about basic things about water baptism and lamb Lord Jesus Christ but it just it really really opened things up for me right there and one of the key things that he said because because the Baptist they said they don't believe in prophets prophets were all the way up to John yeah my mom asked the pastor there a question he said but the Bible says in the last days that there will be false prophets they said but if he said but if there's false prophets there has and that right there just so I got to I got I got to my aunt and started reading uh but first message I repect up was Christ to Mister God revealed and several pages into that message one of the first quake one of the questions I always had in my mind was to why if God is eternal that they begin him from the end why in the world that he created man knowing that he was going to fall what that was a question I've had ever since I was a Christian at twelve years old and and about half way into that message my quarter half way brother Brandon says he talks start talking about God's attributes if he didn't if he if there was nobody to save and nobody had sinned and he can display that Savior attribute if there was nobody to heal there is nobody sick he couldn't display himself to be a healer you see so it all makes sense and I came running out of that room and I said are there I guess I did run my mom was watching the close with my aunt and she said and I said mom look what look what I read here and she was kind of busy she wasn't really paying attention to me so I just went back in the room and started continued reading but something just and then and then just things just started opening up to me and uh you know and then you learn about water baptism and one of the key things is you that is really revealed to you is that you go and do it you see because you can know it but not go do it that's just knowing right right amen so anyways alright so where the branch says here now there that's up comes a seat there's where your mind now jesus said except a man be born of a little girl you're sent to you except a man be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God now you couldn't see the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit right some stand-in here will not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God coming in power Emma speaking about the disciples David right that power the Holy Spirit is the same thing right he was talking about they what they were going to spirits in the upper room he said then the kingdom of God the Bible said is within you is within you the Holy Spirit and you can't see it with your eyes so si means to understand so this kingdom you can't see it that's the reason why you can't explain it it's hard for you to explain to the people you just know it's there now Luke 17 20 we're very familiar with these scriptures but look what we've read this before that jesus jesus answered the defero seized and said imagine when the kingdom of God should come they were looking for a physical Kingdom the Jews but Jesus replies that the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words the kingdom of God comes nobody knows anything about it nobody nobody it's not it's not something that's visible for the world to see something something you know not a show right correct there's not something that you can physically say but but now don't get me wrong those things are fine when the new birth is there right but don't put the cart before the horse because a lot of people put put there will I experience something there at the altar and I shouted and all that and then they go off living like the devil you know you've had an experience it was just on your flesh right because the rain falls on the just and the unjust neither verse 21 neither shall they say lo here or lo er therefore behold the kingdom of God is within you right now the kingdom of God is a mystery luke'll mark 4:11 says and he said to them unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God I like Jesus calls it the mystery right we'll get will look at something just a moment and then Luke 8:10 until you is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables that seem they might not see and hearing they might not understand that's why you can present this word to a lot of people and they keep taking it they can understand water baptism head knowledge but not but not go do it but once you get revelation you will do you will do it doesn't he there's no no there's no what my way Avenue you will be and that's why that's why the Jesus said I really believe he said for no see for the disciples to know see they didn't have the new birth at that time not sure it wasn't until the upper room and then we weren't actually took place then dwell under the Holy Spirit but they knew these mysteries they need but that then saved them right now look look what Colossians says in verse one verse 25 this kingdom of God is a mystery now revealed let's started yeah well I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints amen and what is this mystery to whom god would make know him what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory endures that's the mystery that the world doesn't right and even some of us can't fully understand that especially in these in these and these Minds and these in the in these uh unregenerate admires you know that we have those right that christ would you know wants to reveal himself through me not just to me but thro right that's powerful you know yes amen i know we're being a lot of scripture sayings but yeah what else to read but the word go ahead so again it's difficult to explain your new birth yet you know it's taking place now Hebrews 11 going back to what whether Adele was preaching the other day he said faith Hebrews 11 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not is it how people quote that and say we're made I said but we're not made of things which do appear Shanta now I don't know if you remember was it last year or two years ago I preached a message called when God saw the light and I spoke about this quantum having heard of quantum mechanics now quantum mechanics basically what it's at what it's about is it's the it's the studying of the smallest particles that make up some atomic particles that make up matter right and in matter what the the the law of quanta of quantum mechanics says that this table is made up of molecules and those molecules are made up of atoms but then those atoms are made up of even smaller called quanta in quantity quantity cannot see but yet it's made up that table they know it's there but it's but yet it makes it makes a quantum makes of molecules know atoms and then atoms make up molecules and then now you have the table right and the thing is is that all these things are are held together by light as the reason why God said in the beginning in the beginning God created the heavens and earth and beginning there was there was light but that light wasn't light like the sunlight there's a midnight that light that is talking about is God's law event and God is light different and that's what holds everything together you can't seem it right you but you know it's holding everything together that's the reason why the scripture says here so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear could you can't see you can't see those things but yet you know and science has proven that that is being held by quanta so so that's very that's very interesting that's the reason why we're held together by this new birth but we can't see it you can't you you the armor of the Christian is an unseen armor but you know it's there you have love you have joy peace but it only comes through the Holy Ghost but you can't see those things the only way you can see them is by them being manifested but you can't me show me love but Robin says show me in the house of love go to the store and buy me an ounce of love you can't go to the store buy me an ounce of joy you can't but it's manifested on the outside but it's got to be on the inside first all right amen so you have to receive see faith faith is the substance of things hoped for it it's the evidence of things not seen see when you have faith that's the evidence that you have the new birth when that faith is there then and it's not your own faith it's gotta be God's faith it can come and starts us you you know believing and your faith has to has to you know I believe what God said about me and but then that really turns into God puts his faith in you right that you can fully believe this work in a man and that's what the disciples did in the Upper Room amen that's the reason why they could take scriptures with Krita Papa Peter came preaching taking scriptures with Scripture putting things together because that word that they had heard for three and a half years was quickened it was made alive to them and then they could think it out 3,000 souls came to the kingdom that day name is James two five parking my beloved brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith I love that and heirs of the kingdom Haven that's you and me which he had promised to them that love him you say oh my my faith is weak the Bible says your faith is rich that's what it says and our new era of the kingdom brother Wayne is the only one that knows amen all right so very all right now look what brother Brown says here we'll just get down here the kingdom God's within you so you can actually see it less you see it operating but the only way you'll ever be able to understand it you've got to be born again to be born again you've been filled with God's Spirit then you're in Christ and when you're in Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible that manifested Christ is in you to recognize like this to recognize his own self amen that's an image that's the little innocent one yes very good very going on in just a moment shut up yeah praise God good job so the kingdom of God is made up of attributes that cannot be seen or understood by the natural man any reason why the Bible says the natural man doesn't understand the word go nope doesn't understand that King because it's not it's not it's not something obvious but yet it is to the born-again Christian program says also the Christian looks at things that he doesn't see with his eyes know this is very interesting for we look at the unseen sees how do you look at it with your inside eyes you see it by faith and now to prove that the whole Christian armor is made up of unseen qualities what is a Christian armor somebody says seeing is believing that person would never be a Christian because the armor of the Christian is made up of this love did you ever see it you see it in action but you've never seen love if you can pull your part of love out and let me see what it looks like see look love joy peace longsuffering good meekness faith Jen let's see the whole Christian armor is unseen with the natural eye but it is understood by the heart there you are there you are so you you're made up of these things like quantum right molecules all these things but it's made up foundationally of things that cannot be seen I'm just taking using the natural tighten it with the spiritual first Corinthians before but I will come to you shortly in the Lord will and will note not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power now the key no God is not in word but in power not driving for the kingdom of God is none where further in power so that's the reason why the letter killeth that's the reason you can read this word and you can reap this message and they kill you in the end yep because you're reading it mentally or fleshly alright you can take one quote you can take another quote and you can make it say like brother they'll same last week and make it say whatever you want I say you're right same thing with the word you can take you can take the scripture and and they can prove so prove father son Holy Ghost a Trinity movement right but that same Scripture speaks of one God to you and me daily but to them it's a Trinity right you can make it say whether the letter killeth but the Spirit give it life right amen so this message could kill you if that power is not there to guide you to put these things together in their proper place or in a balanced way by so many even so many doctors even amongst a message okay no because McKee and I learned this several years ago that a lot of people who trouble reach any doctrine whatever the doctor may be you know false doctrine and they'll always take you back is two quotes they will never take you to the word address they never they never David they might say a scripture here too but their foundation is the quote because they can make brother Brown say whatever they wanted whatever they want him to say but that's but member program said faith the Word of God is that's where our faith relies on it rests on on the Word of God that's where that's our foundation right and so you ask these big boys it'll show me a scripture and then they can produce a screamer to back that that doctrine me that whatever they're preaching but they'll always produce a quote that's kind of interesting and that's the reason why it quote can kill you not that the court itself is back it's just that it can kill us spiritually but when it's not put in the right place amen so what is this power acts 1:8 Jesus told them he said but ye shall receive power and that's that Dunamis Dunamis is the greek word for that power because in act in in matthew chapter 10 and in another scripture Jesus gave the disciples power to go cast out Devils but heal the sick and do all these things but that was before their new birth they could do these things even Judas was right there amongst them was performing these miracles he gave them power but that power was not the same power he could you looked at and you look those two words in the Greek that's different this is the word Dunamis and the other one is EXO sia two different powers this power right here has to do with the changing of the so limit with the with the with with the soul amen the other one is just external this is the power that changed them there's there's their soul chemin enters that because the new birth is in your soul it's not God put another soul in you no no he's just renewing that that soul you know he's making it he's putting his soul in you amen what what is the Holy Ghost that's God soul yo man I'm truly man David receive power Dunamis after that the Holy Ghost has come up then that's when ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem journey and all Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the world and that power is that Kingdom remember we said we've said the power that that kingdom of God is is the Holy Ghost all right Luke 9:27 but I tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God faith that was to the disciples and they saw the kingdom of God in that Upper Room everything I was on that little kingdom but they experienced the kingdom that Kingdom started changing and producing more Kingdom people but amen the 3000 program says listen closely the kingdom of God is his word made power right if you want to put that down for spending 430 know God is God's word make powder what is this king of God is within you the kingdoms in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin it turns itself into power making it just say exactly what it said you stay with the word there it is see and it makes it power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's why the words so important things amen the fountain you know the the to read 202 a Christian to a believer the word means everything to them how can you how can you you know you've heard people say I'll take it I'll take this they'll literally hold message book in one hand and the Bible in one hand and say I'll take this over this because this is the revelation of this that doesn't make any sense right right exactly what sad thing but the thing is is that you know I'm someone some someone said one time well I'll just take what brother Brennan said after 1965 or 1963 after the seals and you and I say I say well the Bible was written before 1963 then the brother brandy preached out of the Bible before 1963 you know so it goes hand in hand brother Graham didn't come here to do away with the Bible right he came here to to to to make that Bible alive right that's that same spirit you made when people you talk about what happened in the Old Testament you go do around the 29 X well that's the over there we'll take the new Y and I said we'll wake up them Ten Commandments out in the yard out there right I mean everybody lives by the Ten Commandment everybody sings while the Ten Commandments you know that's Old Testament yeah thank that same devil comes and says I'll take what he says accentuate III up then to prevail like you say this all there anyway you guys do not want you much well just carried out quick read another round don't everything away from 63 backwards because you need it but you can't do that can you gonna commend it every you needed that them that restorations ministry of brother Brandon if that was like talking to us absolutely started in 47 yeah kept talking till name I say you started even before that has just started being recorded in 1947 but but the well we know his true message was when those seals were open sure we know that was his message no that was his true message that's right but we needed that restoration we needed that those years of restoration right before we could understand this right if you don't get the Foundation's right then you won't understand that heads right that's that's that's the word phrase done so you have to I say I'm gonna build the roof forget the foundation we're gonna build the roof Oh what and that's the reason why you know and that's where that's why we're probably gonna have to go over there next next time I'll talk I'll talk to him brother anybody remember that image that Daniel saw a brother brother bought for a Bob's mentioned this before but that image that Daniel saw it was built from the head and down we are built from the feet up you see there's a foundation that found that Satan's image for Satan's Kingdom has no foundation it looks good from the head down but eventually it'll crumble David I will get to that Lake now God's kingdom is not of this world and when Christ was here he give us the program of this kingdom he gave us the program of God scheme that the father's Kingdom which is his word now is the key so the kingdom is the Holy Ghost his word power it's all this thing ever now if you want to know how you get into a kingdom this words got it well just let's see when Peter on the day of Pentecost opened the door to the kingdom he did the kingdom had just been set up in Jerusalem the kingdom was set up on the day of Pentecost and when man wanted to know how to get into this kingdom Peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because that's what puts them into the kingdom that Adam Genesis 1:26 amen so in Genesis 1:26 man was that perfect kingdom when he turn a life in his soul that is what God is trying to bring us back to the track right because he turned a lot of people knew Bert's movie in your soul and brother Graham said this himself I don't have the quote but when you received the back to the molle goes the new birth that puts you back into that place Genesis 1:26 in your soul that's right that Adam women now this is before Genesis 2:7 when the flesh of man but evident became on Adam but remember the trashman of Adam was not was was was not was was corruptible it died it wasn't eternal but but but but that soul of Adams was eternal right and so when you received a new birth when your it takes you back to that Eden condition right yeah that Adam was in in that Genesis 1:26 because look what he said now we have to have it because here's the title of this yeah I'm getting home just going back and forth but the kingdom has to be established in early 1st then it can manifest out early and reign properly right Jess is 1 3 6 and God said let us make man in our image let us make man in our image after our likeness so then there's brother Brown good there's a lot of quotes for brother Branham supports that Adam was just as just as like God in that game at 1:26 man absolutely that was that was God Amon and what are you and me supposed to be a betrayal with God in flesh right here we've received a new birth in our soul it doesn't feel like it it doesn't feel like we got a flesh because our flesh certainly doesn't feel like it but we that's what God said about you and me Haven let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl in the air all right Adam have full dominion over all these things that's the reason why the creation is waiting for its travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God that's right we have the new birth we've got with the kingdom established inwardly but it's got to be manifested on the outside right and that's that's that's the heart that's what that's what we're scaling this right here this is for the this is for the external payment right but you can't you can't control this without having an inward leaf or a cut right see a kingdom a kingdom has them a physical Kingdom has to be an order physically inwardly first then they connect then it can produce outwardly order Amen right I don't know we can say the same thing about Washington DC but stop it but there has to really how things should be it has there has to be ordered inside first in order for there to be order outside that's right right you have to have dominion over your inward Kingdom first in order for there to be Dominion on the outside on your external key right but it all blends into one king that's right amen that's why you need these virtue and whoever said you don't need these is a liar doesn't understand that but as a half for the men you know that is in your kingdom that's right you need to the unique unique other otherwise brother Branham just wasted his time preaching a message about this that's right you need to have faith virtue knowledge temperance godliness but this isn't further to say could you burst starts down here heaven right and without the Holy Ghost without you being born again without lowly ghosts you can't produce godly virgin you can't produce godly knowledge and all these all these things right you need to have the baptism holy goats homos I just always wondered when it said that us man in our image that's for so is that the Father Son and the Holy Ghost in one is that what God was thinking when he said don't wait on the chance that's all it was yeah get on the topic we'll cover that later all right I mean Jesus is all three of them with absolute right and that's what then we'll look at something next next time overload they're pretty much the same thing okay yes that's the way we're looking at let's just read this real quick and I'll finish this in the smyrna churches truck unless we suffer with him we cannot Raymond in Detroit you have to suffer to rain it's it's tough struggling you know it's coming through this doctor today but it's worth it the reason for this is that character simply has never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift naima all right a man without character cane train because power apart from character is satanic exactly amen but power that kingdom power with character is fit to rule images and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has sat down and his Father's throne then we have to overcome his right to sit with him amen y'all just chew on that with resolute mean Lord will and next Sunday we'll continue anybody have do we have to we have some time left or no three minutes you already have a question comment this is Trudy you said you sound like you have a common baby appreciate our sister they have been with us I'll give you and yeah yes all right well let's all go ahead and go up [Music]
