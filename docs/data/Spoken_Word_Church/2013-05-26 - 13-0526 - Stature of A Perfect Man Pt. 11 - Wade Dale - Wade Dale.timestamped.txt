[0:47] and KCK it back on all right second
[0:50] Peter
[0:51] 1 second Peter 1 let's go and read this
[0:54] and then we're going to approach
[0:56] something
[0:57] today um it's going to help us right
[1:00] start right into Faith all right second
[1:03] Peter chapter 1 Simon Peter servant and
[1:05] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[1:06] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[1:10] us through the righteousness of God and
[1:12] our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace
[1:13] be multiplied unto you through the
[1:15] knowledge of God Jesus our lord
[1:18] according as his divine power hath given
[1:20] unto us all
[1:21] things that pertain to life see pertain
[1:25] to
[1:27] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:30] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:32] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:34] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:36] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:37] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:39] corruption that is in the world to L
[1:41] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:43] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[1:46] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[1:47] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:49] godl brother kindness to brotherly
[1:52] kindness
[1:53] charity for if these things be in you
[1:55] and abound they make you that you shall
[1:58] neither be bearing and un fruit fruitful
[2:00] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[2:02] Christ
[2:04] right so
[2:07] I was trying to find another way to to
[2:11] get up a little bit and try to you know
[2:13] kind of stir your mind and it came to me
[2:15] Dad and I we're talking Monday or
[2:18] something Monday or Tuesday this week
[2:19] and and it kind of struck me on what
[2:21] he's preaching on Law and
[2:23] Grace and to me that's the bottom
[2:28] line we live by the
[2:32] law but if we don't have Grace then the
[2:34] law is going to condemn us very simple
[2:36] but very
[2:37] profound but the law you can't do away
[2:40] with the law cuz the law is a school
[2:41] Master the law is like I said it's like
[2:43] this table the law is like stainless
[2:44] steel the law is the hardest steal in
[2:46] the world you do this you die you do
[2:49] this you die you do this you die you
[2:51] look on a woman bless after in your
[2:53] heart ver committ adulter that's hard
[2:56] there's no wavering to that all right
[2:58] there's no wavering to things in
[3:00] Scripture that we do but there's a Grace
[3:03] blanket that goes over that that gives
[3:06] us Grace if we do make mistakes because
[3:08] God knows we're human but we have a
[3:09] Grace blanket to cover over that and
[3:12] then if you don't have that Grace
[3:13] blanket then you have to go back to
[3:16] where the scripture says in Revelations
[3:18] that they were judged by their works
[3:19] well law is the
[3:22] works you do this don't do that do this
[3:25] don't do that cuz when you go up to the
[3:26] Judgment you're going to they they said
[3:28] have I not done these Mighty things in
[3:30] your name have I not see they were
[3:31] trying to work their s
[3:34] up but without the grace blanket they're
[3:36] standing their NE they're standing there
[3:39] with whatever they' done that's what
[3:40] they've done and that's it well that's
[3:42] the
[3:43] law that's the Judgment but the grace
[3:46] blanket that goes over that which is the
[3:48] blood of Jesus Christ we know that but
[3:50] that's what
[3:53] covers back in the Old Testament see it
[3:55] covered Over law but when you go over to
[3:58] the New Testament it do does just cover
[4:00] sin it eradicates it like Daddy was
[4:04] saying about that you can be can't be
[4:06] justified you can be
[4:08] forgiven cuz you did do it right but
[4:12] when the real you comes and shows
[4:15] itself when the real you the Genesis 1:
[4:18] 126 and 27 when that real you comes and
[4:21] it never done it it never smoked drank
[4:23] Li cuss committed adultery never done
[4:26] any of those things that's why brother
[4:27] Brown said the real you didn't do it
[4:31] but the realization has to come that
[4:32] that real you is inside of
[4:35] you and it's working on the part that's
[4:37] outside and that's what we're going to
[4:39] listen to what the prophet has to say
[4:41] but but here's the steps and and I I
[4:44] like the um the way brother brandham
[4:47] even the way he preaches his sermons
[4:49] once he get to about 1960 or 61 when he
[4:52] comes in preaches the church
[4:54] ages God is setting a
[4:57] pattern he's setting a pattern for us to
[5:00] see does everybody understand that each
[5:03] message is a stepping stone to the next
[5:06] one right
[5:07] okay cuz watch what he says now we are
[5:11] approaching the Seven Seals we have just
[5:13] finished the seven Church
[5:15] ages and this is a message on teaching
[5:18] that ties the man
[5:20] in that's going to be Redeemed by the
[5:23] blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to
[5:25] be in that church age now he's not
[5:28] talking about a Church age he's talking
[5:30] about eternal Church
[5:32] age at the end of the
[5:34] seals now we know that we have seven
[5:37] trumpet seven plagues vile so forth that
[5:39] we get into as we go along but we're
[5:41] waiting for more room so people can be
[5:43] seated and I thought this would
[5:53] tie and I thought this was tie in just
[5:56] where I was
[5:58] expecting I didn't expect to to draw
[6:01] this skeleton but the other day there he
[6:04] was in the in the woods and God Drew
[6:07] this picture for
[6:08] it but I want to get it where everybody
[6:10] can see it hold it up here for just a
[6:14] minute but you see he drew that skeleton
[6:17] and then Peter didn't have this kind of
[6:20] a structure to go by Peter just said add
[6:23] to your faith virtue virtue knowledge
[6:24] knowledge Temperance not thinking about
[6:26] a pyramid but then when brother random
[6:29] was up in the woods he said God give him
[6:32] this all right so you add to your faith
[6:35] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temper
[6:37] Temper patience patience godliness godl
[6:39] brother kindness and then Divine
[6:42] love and then being a prophet he put
[6:46] this in
[6:47] here cuz he said if you'll read later on
[6:50] we'll read brother R said the holy
[6:51] spirit melds all that together or melts
[6:54] it all together seals it in now you're
[6:56] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[6:58] down here
[7:00] right when you're born again when you're
[7:01] born again we've been through this when
[7:04] you're born again that's the foundation
[7:06] you must be born again all right then
[7:09] add to your faith or to your Revelation
[7:12] or to your new
[7:14] birth virtue add to your new birth
[7:17] knowledge and that's what he's talking
[7:19] about because he went to the church ages
[7:22] he's saying now we got to do this for
[7:24] the man and then go over into the
[7:27] seals everybody got that mhm you watch
[7:30] him lay a pattern then he's got Daniel
[7:31] 70 weeks in there 1962 all that had to
[7:35] be set in order before he could bring
[7:37] the seals now what's he
[7:39] doing like Dad and I were talking the
[7:41] other day you can't just have baby form
[7:45] Faith listen this is a foundation for
[7:47] the rest of the whole of the whole U
[7:50] Sunday school you can't have
[7:52] baby
[7:54] faith and have a revelation a total
[7:57] revelation of the seventh seal
[8:03] can't do it brother brandham was right
[8:06] here when the Revelation came to him now
[8:09] how are you and I Ain going to be any
[8:12] different oh yeah we got a revelation
[8:14] brother Dale's got a revelation that
[8:16] brother R had a revelation that's our
[8:17] Revelation if we're if we're down here
[8:21] if we're here it becomes our
[8:25] Revelation not meaning you're not a
[8:27] Christian down here sure you are there's
[8:29] there's Untold billions if there's going
[8:32] to be a billion Christians in the world
[8:34] there's going to be a billion Christians
[8:36] that's never been at this place right
[8:38] here right right right all through the
[8:42] church ages they never reached even the
[8:45] even the first people Peter Paul James
[8:47] and all those they were right here at
[8:49] brotherly kindness they never had the
[8:51] headstone or Capstone revelation of the
[8:54] seals right but see you hear everybody
[8:57] and even people in this church they go
[8:59] go well I need I want to know about the
[9:00] seals well have you got this
[9:03] yet have you got all these virtues
[9:05] working in your
[9:06] life has this come to you as a
[9:09] revelation that the Seven Seals are what
[9:12] they are or are we just saying it was a
[9:15] revelation that brother Dale had that
[9:16] brother Brandon had white horse rider
[9:18] was the Antichrist
[9:20] woohoo that's easy to read that's that's
[9:23] just being able to read the
[9:25] quote but you see right here's why this
[9:28] is important I believe that's why the
[9:29] Lord impressed on me to come back and
[9:31] start over again on this cuz we've been
[9:32] through this
[9:33] before but really this time it's got to
[9:36] be an order just like what brother Brown
[9:38] said brother Brown said you got to get
[9:39] the church
[9:41] ages know what age you're in know what
[9:44] Revelation come to your age
[9:48] then what does he say right there the
[9:51] body the man got to bring the man in the
[9:54] outside guy because what's the seals for
[9:57] the seals are not for the
[9:59] cleansing of the Soul if you're born
[10:01] again right right you don't need to be
[10:05] cleansed in the soul right you need to
[10:08] be bodied so what's brother Rand doing
[10:09] he's bringing from the out of the church
[10:11] ages they didn't have that Revelation so
[10:14] he preached the church ages set all
[10:16] these in
[10:17] order set all the characteristics in
[10:19] order everything's in order so we know
[10:22] that's the foundation all right then he
[10:24] comes and just what he said a few
[10:26] minutes ago go back to that again
[10:38] and this is a message on teaching that
[10:41] ties the man
[10:43] in that's going to be Redeemed by the
[10:46] blood of the Lord Jesus
[10:47] now Jesus is not got to die
[10:51] again you got to see what he's already
[10:53] done he's got to come out of the church
[10:55] ages though cuz watch what he says and
[10:58] it's going to be be in that church age
[11:00] not not the seven Church ages he just
[11:02] preached no cuz he says that Eternal
[11:05] Church age at the end of the
[11:09] seals now we know that we got trumpets
[11:11] vs and all that so forth but we're
[11:13] waiting for more room in other words to
[11:15] preach it but but what we need to do is
[11:17] is quit is quit haunting so much on we
[11:21] we got the letter of
[11:23] the of what the seals are right we got
[11:26] the letter we've had brother Dale preach
[11:28] it we've had brother Brandon preach it
[11:30] we've had several others preach it hit
[11:31] on it and do a very good job but it's
[11:34] got to be a personal
[11:36] revelation right to
[11:39] you but before we need to know before
[11:42] anything and now we can have a knowledge
[11:44] and and you can have that laying there
[11:47] dorant okay you can have it laying there
[11:50] dormant in your in your in your soul cuz
[11:53] you got everything you need there if you
[11:54] got the Holy Ghost
[11:56] right but we limit the holy Holy Ghost
[11:59] by what we remember what we take in we
[12:03] limit it filters flu all that stuff
[12:07] okay but he's want brother R's want to
[12:09] tie the man in why he's wanting
[12:11] everybody to turn and
[12:14] look at the actions and reactions and
[12:18] the man and what the man does and and
[12:20] how the man works and and all these
[12:22] virtues that we're supposed to have
[12:24] working in our life then he talks about
[12:28] this holy Spirit
[12:30] coming and sealing it all in when I see
[12:33] you're sealed until the day of your
[12:34] Redemption if you're born again in your
[12:36] soul but Ephesians 1 says you only have
[12:41] an
[12:43] Earnest this is the down
[12:47] payment then God gives you a payment
[12:49] book right right it's got seven
[12:52] different payment book seven different
[12:54] pages in a payment book you know how you
[12:56] get a payment book if you make payment
[12:57] on a house or something tear that one
[12:59] off and you write a check and put it on
[13:00] there and turn it in right cuz you're
[13:02] making payments on the earnest money
[13:04] that you pull the earnest was right here
[13:06] but the Bible keeps going on in
[13:08] Ephesians says until the full purchase
[13:12] possession in other words when that
[13:13] title de to that house you're always
[13:16] real
[13:17] nervous while you making them payments
[13:19] cuz you missed four or five and you're
[13:21] they're going to come get you the house
[13:23] anyway not you right right so so you
[13:28] nervous about that but man when you got
[13:30] that deed in your
[13:32] hand that's a title deed to Redemption
[13:37] when you got that title de in your hand
[13:38] sure you got a you got a potential of it
[13:41] here
[13:44] Earnest until the full purchase
[13:46] possession which is what body spirit and
[13:48] soul cuz see here's where the seals
[13:51] comes Divine love that's where the
[13:53] Capstone Revelation that was lost down
[13:56] through time that nobody knew about
[13:58] except the Lord
[13:59] Jesus and it came to brother Brown then
[14:02] it has to come to me and you can't be
[14:04] just his
[14:05] Revelation but we got to have this
[14:07] working first before God can make that
[14:10] 100% working in our life cuz we're going
[14:13] to go through this and you keep watching
[14:15] the points brother B said you get up
[14:16] this far and what fall off get up this
[14:19] far and find a crack get up this far
[14:22] what what's he doing you're building up
[14:24] to him well now if brother brandham had
[14:25] any
[14:26] cracks sure he had little flaws in his
[14:29] ministry that he hadn't seen yet but
[14:31] when he come to the full
[14:33] revelation God corrected him right
[14:35] remember he said I wouldn't made a
[14:37] horrible mistake because he had an idea
[14:40] idea that wasn't a
[14:42] revelation and you can have that going
[14:44] up to here but once you get to here when
[14:47] you get to there when that Holy Spirit
[14:49] comes down and seals that together cuz
[14:51] remember you got to be where that God
[14:54] can say this is why he took brother
[14:55] rount on the
[14:57] mountain come down with the cloud he did
[15:00] the same thing like he did Jesus in
[15:02] Matthew
[15:04] 17 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[15:06] please to dwell now that was at the
[15:09] River Jordan that was at your new birth
[15:12] when God comes down and gives you the
[15:13] new birth he says to the
[15:15] world this is my beloved son or daughter
[15:18] in whom I'm pleased to dwell but he
[15:20] didn't say hear ye him until Jesus the
[15:23] Bible says he grew in Grace and
[15:26] knowledge being made perfect now Jesus
[15:29] was perfect the
[15:31] Christ but Jesus the man was human
[15:34] wasn't two people the same person but
[15:37] that human body had to learn to do
[15:38] things just like me and you did right
[15:41] but he didn't have a different Spirit
[15:43] you and I were born with a a contrary
[15:45] nature he was not born with a contrary
[15:48] nature so he was this walking on Earth
[15:51] in a body of Flesh we're going to read
[15:53] it in just a minute cuz brother R goes
[15:55] to Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast
[15:58] prepared me mean that's what happened
[16:00] the Old Testament built a body for God
[16:02] to step into called the baby Jesus all
[16:06] right but listen to my
[16:10] point like brother Rand said there's a
[16:13] there's a stepping
[16:15] stone cuz remember there's stones in the
[16:18] Bible which is revelation then there's a
[16:21] stumbling Stone the Bible said the rock
[16:23] of
[16:24] offense and they stumble Over The
[16:26] Stumbling Stone which is The Stumbling
[16:28] Stones down here which is Christ right
[16:32] see you got to remember see this pyramid
[16:35] this is the pyramid in
[16:37] itself these cornerstones are pyramids
[16:40] in the
[16:41] themselves so that just that just grows
[16:45] bigger and then God comes down with the
[16:48] total Apex of what he's always
[16:52] wanted and says this is my beloved Son
[16:54] in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear what
[16:57] he's got to say cuz I'm the one that's
[16:59] talking through it he actually has come
[17:01] to the place to where he's got virtue my
[17:05] virtue God same m not mine but he's
[17:10] identifying brother r that brother R's
[17:12] got virtue like I had virtue when I
[17:15] walked on the shores of
[17:17] Galilee I've got knowledge I've give him
[17:20] Temperance I've give him patience CU
[17:22] these are gifts right these are
[17:25] gifts all right the problem is is we
[17:28] fall
[17:28] in
[17:30] here and we don't have to start all over
[17:32] but we have to start at a place to where
[17:33] we have to realize that God before you
[17:36] can reveal the seals to me I got to have
[17:39] these things working in my life and if I
[17:41] don't see these things working in my
[17:42] life that's where we need to work not
[17:43] work up
[17:45] there first grade second grade third
[17:47] grade we work
[17:48] on Elementary things now after the third
[17:52] grade if you walk up into third grade
[17:54] after the third grade's over you say I
[17:56] got to who man I'm going to 12th grade
[17:58] next next year you'd have a rude waiting
[18:00] me wouldn't you you walk in that 12th
[18:03] grade and that 1 plus one is going to
[18:04] help you but you going to see numbers
[18:07] you never seen before right right same
[18:10] way with the gospel you going to see
[18:12] things you never seen before and it's
[18:13] what it's going to do it's going to
[18:14] choke you or stunt your growth so the
[18:17] best thing for us to do is is to leave
[18:19] things alone we don't
[18:21] understand put it aside we've heard it
[18:23] it's in here it's in this it's in this
[18:26] computer that we have it's in that
[18:28] computer that's physically here and it's
[18:31] in the books and the Tes now where did
[18:32] Brother R say raps and Faith Life book
[18:34] books and the Tes so it's in there we
[18:37] don't have to go get it from from
[18:39] Charles Stanley or James doson no it
[18:42] come through William brand that's that's
[18:43] my son that I'm going to talk to you
[18:45] with and he was standing at a place to
[18:48] where that God could speak through him
[18:51] and it would be his thoughts there was
[18:53] no altering thought of a man's idea so
[18:56] that's what dad's preaching on now
[18:58] that's man's idea that's what's killing
[18:59] us our own ideas on the word of
[19:03] God that's what started in the garden of
[19:06] Ed all
[19:07] right and and to be honest with you
[19:10] there won't be a lot of people get to
[19:12] this spot right here but who's to
[19:15] choose we are is it for you to
[19:18] choose you choose whether you do but
[19:21] you're not going to choose where the Bob
[19:22] does or not right right so you got to
[19:25] say hey I got to do this I'm not worried
[19:28] about brother Bob if he wants some help
[19:30] we'll all help each other you understand
[19:31] what I'm saying but that's why brother R
[19:33] always said it's an individual Affair of
[19:36] God we're going to go into Rapture
[19:39] together but some's got to go by the
[19:41] grave remember we preached on the six
[19:42] seal there six seal purging if you can't
[19:45] come to a purging of True Body Spirit
[19:47] and soul you're going to have to die cuz
[19:49] that will be what will Purge you from
[19:51] your old man cuz your old man is going
[19:54] to still be
[19:56] there the same same body that Mom and
[19:59] Daddy brought is going to be in that
[20:00] ground but what's going to Quicken it
[20:02] the same spirit that raised up Jesus
[20:03] from the
[20:04] dead if he be in you he'll Quicken your
[20:08] mortal body and change those
[20:11] atoms into the person you should have
[20:13] been start
[20:15] with did Jesus in the garden the
[20:19] body because it was still a human body
[20:22] is that why he agonized sure he wouldn't
[20:25] have it if he had he never agonized
[20:28] afterward cuz remember after when he
[20:30] raised up he said all power all power in
[20:33] Heaven and Earth has been given unto me
[20:35] I can walk through that wall now if I
[20:36] want to I can do whatever I want to do
[20:39] with this flesh body to me that's what
[20:41] he was saying cuz he had all
[20:43] power in the Christ that he was you hear
[20:45] what I'm saying in the Christ that he
[20:47] was that's why his name is the Lord
[20:49] Jesus Christ not just Jesus there many
[20:51] jesuses but when you put Christ in there
[20:53] that shows that Eternal god well now you
[20:56] and I are little Christ
[20:58] when are we going to start putting our
[20:59] names together with
[21:02] that not literally but when are we going
[21:04] to start looking at it that way that if
[21:06] Christ in you the hope of glory what
[21:09] Paul said right not another Christ not a
[21:14] second person the same
[21:17] person that walked the shore that's why
[21:19] it's that's why that brother R told us
[21:21] and all those little stories he said you
[21:22] need to get into the into the U Spirit
[21:26] of the
[21:27] composer CU I've always said before if I
[21:30] write a book about my love for my wife
[21:33] y'all will read it and go good that's
[21:36] okay that's good wasn't there so but
[21:38] it's good read you know I enjoyed it it
[21:40] was okay close the book but if I could
[21:42] ever get what my experience was cuz I
[21:45] was there if I could get my experience
[21:47] of my spirit and put it in you you'll
[21:50] look at it in a different way cuz you'll
[21:52] know exactly what I'm talking about not
[21:54] just a good read well I don't want this
[21:56] to be just a good read
[21:58] right it's become just a good read
[22:00] everybody can read the message now cuz
[22:02] you can pull up quotes like this
[22:03] anywhere in the world anywhere you can
[22:05] get internet you can pull a quote up but
[22:08] it's the quote being made alive the
[22:10] quote's got to be made alive so we got
[22:13] work to do we're approaching the Seven
[22:15] Seals finish the church ages cuz the
[22:18] church Ages was what he brought all of
[22:22] the foundational
[22:25] doctrines back into the church right but
[22:27] if you read search A's book that's
[22:28] pretty much everything except like
[22:31] marriage and divorce and a couple of
[22:32] things later on but serpent SE one God
[22:35] no eternal hell I mean Church's book
[22:37] covers it all well that's what he was
[22:38] doing he was building it back to where
[22:40] we could do what have
[22:43] faith in what we're
[22:45] reading do we have faith in what we're
[22:49] reading like the Bible says don't
[22:51] forsake the assembling of yourself
[22:53] together and it says at the it says a
[22:56] little part that we don't read
[22:59] as the day
[23:01] approaches more
[23:04] so so my question is I'm asking
[23:07] Christians today do you go to church
[23:08] more today than you did before if not
[23:10] you
[23:12] backslid I'm reading the Bible am I
[23:14] telling you it's not my quote Yeah if
[23:17] you don't want to go to church more now
[23:18] than you did before then you're
[23:21] backsp this ought to be the most
[23:23] important part of your
[23:26] life amen how many of us could have jobs
[23:29] that we work on Sunday and make probably
[23:31] twice what we're making now I I know I
[23:33] could cuz I could choose a job I could
[23:36] in my field that I could work on
[23:38] Sunday but the Bible says seek ye first
[23:42] the kingdom of heaven and then these
[23:44] things will be added all right so you
[23:47] tell the person you say hey I'm going to
[23:49] it's like I told U like I told somebody
[23:52] one time before and Dad's made mention
[23:54] about it I told somebody standing right
[23:55] up there in the right outside
[23:58] somebody said they got a a job for the
[24:01] glory of the
[24:03] Lord but they only going be here on
[24:04] Wednesday or
[24:06] Sunday and I said buddy God didn't give
[24:08] you that job you got that job out of
[24:10] your own intellect right cuz God
[24:13] wouldn't give you a job and cross what
[24:15] he said in the Bible you can't cross
[24:18] scripture just to get a
[24:20] job seek you first the kingdom of heaven
[24:23] and all these other things will fall in
[24:25] line so if you put that first what I'm
[24:27] saying about let's let's get these first
[24:29] let's get these working in our life
[24:31] before we start looking at the seal and
[24:35] maybe you know what we may see the seals
[24:38] in a different
[24:40] light once we have the virtues working
[24:42] because when we do then we have then
[24:44] become the one that wrote the
[24:48] book cuz see nobody understood what that
[24:50] book was even when it was open in
[24:52] Revelations 10:7 nobody understood what
[24:55] it was saying they just said oh listen
[24:57] open book and John ate it well that's
[25:00] good but what there must have been
[25:02] something written on
[25:03] it cuz the angel was very very adamant
[25:07] he said here take this thing and eat it
[25:10] CU there was something inside of it it
[25:12] wasn't just a book everybody says well
[25:13] we're in the age of the open book well
[25:15] that's good but there's something in
[25:17] that book that even though you got it
[25:21] open it's not been
[25:24] revealed right right so we need to take
[25:28] that book and leave it open and start
[25:31] turning the
[25:32] pages through virtue knowledge
[25:34] Temperance patience CU that's our guide
[25:36] book brother brandham preached that
[25:38] night
[25:40] after excuse me after that sermon what
[25:43] did he preach that morning he preached
[25:46] the statute of a perfect man that night
[25:47] he spoke on God of my
[25:51] life and he went through and told a lot
[25:53] of different things that happened in his
[25:55] life what was he doing he was
[25:56] punctuating he was was putting a
[25:58] punctuation or an exclamation point of
[26:00] what he preached that
[26:02] morning cuz he preached the statue of a
[26:04] perfect man then he preached the guide
[26:05] of my life or the or a guide and he
[26:08] showed how God had guided him up to that
[26:10] place when he gets to that place he can
[26:13] come and tell us he can't tell us about
[26:15] New York if he's never been I've never
[26:16] been in New York I can look at pictures
[26:18] I can read books I can even Google it I
[26:21] can Google Maps and I look right down on
[26:22] it and I can say oh man um what is that
[26:26] Time Square it's a beautiful place but
[26:28] never been there so I can't tell you but
[26:30] people that's been there and go man they
[26:32] can what they can give you
[26:34] detail the best way to get there and the
[26:37] best thing to see while you're there and
[26:39] the things not to see or not get caught
[26:41] up into well that's the way God is
[26:43] that's the way God is with the Holy
[26:45] Ghost he gives you a guide to lead you
[26:47] someplace because he's been there before
[26:50] and it's not New York it's a
[26:52] revelation so we need to walk into the
[26:55] Revelation and and watch this listen
[26:57] let's go down a little bit further if I
[27:00] had do page down how far will it go
[27:03] down huh a
[27:11] page all right let's look go
[27:15] ahead now these are not this is not
[27:17] continuous read if you'll notice the I
[27:20] just took the tag quotes that I wanted
[27:21] to read now let that soak in real deep
[27:24] not preaching this morning just teaching
[27:25] this lesson divine nature let me read
[27:27] the fourth verse again so you won't miss
[27:29] it for by we are given unto us exceeding
[27:32] great and precious Promises by these
[27:33] these promises we might be partakers of
[27:36] the divine nature having escaped the
[27:37] corruption that is in the world through
[27:39] lust see the world we've escaped that
[27:42] now yeah he's addressing this to the
[27:45] church in other words one that's already
[27:46] sealed in by the Holy Ghost all right
[27:49] and I'm going to use baby form cuz it is
[27:51] the baby form holy when you receive the
[27:53] Holy Ghost it's just like a baby
[27:55] walking you got to feed it you got to
[27:57] walk watch it you got to pick it up you
[27:58] got to teach it how to do this that's
[28:00] what God's doing he's teaching us how to
[28:02] do this
[28:04] thing that's why we're here this morning
[28:07] is to find out what is the way what is
[28:09] God's requirement now we read this
[28:11] before yeah but it's a
[28:14] requirement all right there's not a
[28:17] person in here that loves God but wants
[28:19] to become more like Christ now it's laid
[28:21] and now it's laid out here now if you
[28:24] want to be more like Christ it's laid
[28:26] out here he's speaking to tell us the
[28:28] steps it takes to be like Jesus all
[28:31] right every Christian I'm an old veteran
[28:33] look at brother and sister Kia they're
[28:34] probably the oldest in the building but
[28:36] i' ask them what's your heart desire to
[28:37] be closer to God when you learn of
[28:39] Christ there's something about him
[28:41] that's so loving you just try to get
[28:43] right into him all right now down to
[28:46] paragraph 51 cuz the people on the
[28:48] internet can't see it now he he has
[28:51] given us the outline here what to do
[28:55] pretty plain huh yeah
[28:58] know how to do
[29:01] it know how to do
[29:03] it now as I said we're trying to come
[29:05] closer to God that's why I chose this
[29:07] message this morning for the church
[29:09] knowing that people are traveling for
[29:11] last night I said how many here out of
[29:12] town then 90% of them is out of
[29:15] town those people don't come to church
[29:17] like that just to be
[29:19] seen as what the outside world will see
[29:22] beauty around this place they're all
[29:23] common people poor ordinary dress but
[29:25] there's no great anthems or angelic
[29:27] Flyers have a hard time getting to see
[29:30] but they come because inside of them is
[29:31] something that sees a beauty that the
[29:34] natural eye can't see it's a spiritual
[29:36] lie that catches the beauty of Christ
[29:38] that's why they come all right now you
[29:40] go down to paragraph 61 last Sunday
[29:43] brother brand preached on the key now
[29:46] what an appropriate way to start the
[29:48] statue of perfect man is the
[29:51] key cuz the door is there but unless you
[29:54] got a key yeah you can't have nothing
[29:58] behind that door unless you got a key
[30:01] now what does he say the key is key is
[30:03] Faith the faith holds the key and the
[30:06] key is the scripture and Christ is the
[30:10] door see so Faith takes the little
[30:13] hinges of the scripture and unlocks the
[30:16] glories and good of God out to his
[30:18] people see so it holds the key that
[30:21] unlocks Christ to the people if you got
[30:24] faith in something you got what
[30:26] confidence see man had not had
[30:28] confidence down through the church ages
[30:31] someone would tell them this someone
[30:32] would tell them this and same way in the
[30:34] message now somebody tell you this
[30:35] somebody tell you that but when you got
[30:37] confidence that somebody's bringing you
[30:40] the word of God you have confidence in
[30:42] that you can just lay your rest on that
[30:44] yeah all right you don't have to be
[30:45] tossed to and fro the Bible says by
[30:47] every wind of Doctrine So today we're
[30:49] going to try to take that same key now
[30:52] he preached on the key didn't preach on
[30:54] the virtues he preached on the key the
[30:55] way to get in all right which is Faith
[30:58] the way to get in So today we're going
[31:01] to try to take that same key to unlock
[31:03] the way to become not just a Christian
[31:06] cuz you're already a Christian if you're
[31:08] born again you're a Christian all right
[31:10] but a virtuous Christian in the stature
[31:13] of
[31:14] God that and be a living Tabernacle for
[31:17] the Living God to dwell in remember God
[31:19] revealed himself in three ways first he
[31:21] revealed pill of fire that was the
[31:23] fatherhood then that same God made
[31:25] manifest in Jesus Christ which he built
[31:27] the body made this body thirdly through
[31:29] the death of that body he Sanctified a
[31:32] church that he can dwell in it was God
[31:34] above us God With Us and God in us the
[31:36] same God then he goes through and tells
[31:38] about father son the Holy Ghost not
[31:40] three
[31:42] Gods now paragraph 67 statute of perfect
[31:45] man now we're going to study his word
[31:46] Steven said in Act 7 let's read remember
[31:49] where Steven was talking about the
[31:50] Tabernacle our fathers had a tabernacle
[31:52] of witness in the wilderness as he was
[31:54] appointed speaking unto Moses that he
[31:55] should make it according to the fashion
[31:56] that he had
[31:57] seen which also our fathers had our
[32:00] fathers that come in a after brought in
[32:02] Jesus unto the possession of the
[32:04] Gentiles who God drove out before the
[32:06] face of our fathers until the days of
[32:10] David who found favor before God and
[32:12] desired to find a tabernacle for the god
[32:14] of Jacob but Solomon built him a house
[32:16] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[32:18] temples made with hands as sayith the
[32:20] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[32:22] my foot St what house will you build me
[32:23] sayith the Lord what is the place of my
[32:26] rest now brother B goes right to Hebrews
[32:29] 10 and 5 now Tabernacle is of course a
[32:32] place where we go to rest now get
[32:34] freshness and so forth like resting from
[32:36] sleep or so forth now Hebrews 10:5 says
[32:39] wherefore when he cometh in the world he
[32:41] sayth sacrifice that's Christ and
[32:43] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[32:45] hast thou prepared me what is the
[32:47] Tabernacle
[32:48] now it's a
[32:50] body God tabernacling in a body God
[32:53] wants up high when he come down on the
[32:55] mountain even a bulock or cow touch the
[32:56] mountain he must be killed God is Holy
[32:59] last evening when those angels covered
[33:01] their faces holy seraphim with holy
[33:03] faces don't even know what sin means and
[33:05] they have to cover their face in the
[33:06] presence of God cover their feet in
[33:08] humility now holy God could not condone
[33:10] sin so nothing could touch the mountain
[33:12] where God was then God was made flesh
[33:15] and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus
[33:16] Christ his son his creation then that
[33:19] son gave his life and the blood cell of
[33:20] God was broken that the life might come
[33:23] out of the blood to us all right through
[33:27] the blood we are cleansed and now our
[33:28] blood our life which come by living
[33:30] through sexual desire brought our life
[33:32] in the world the blood of Jesus Christ
[33:35] cleanses us changes our Nature by
[33:37] sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we
[33:39] become into the divine nature of God now
[33:41] that's what he was talking about when
[33:42] Peter says that having the divine nature
[33:45] he's still down at the bottom of the
[33:46] pyramid he went up he's still down there
[33:48] at Faith right right change our Nature
[33:52] by sending us the Holy Spirit then we
[33:53] become into the divine nature of God
[33:56] comma
[33:57] then we become a dwelling place for God
[33:59] Jesus said at that day you know that I'm
[34:01] in the father and the father me I in you
[34:03] and you in
[34:05] me so you see and we say oh we know that
[34:08] that that our body is the Temple of the
[34:10] Holy Ghost and all these things
[34:14] well from what brother brand saying
[34:17] that's just getting you
[34:18] started the body come from sexual desire
[34:21] the the the the spirit comes from from
[34:24] God but it's perverted because the
[34:27] memory reason conscience affection
[34:29] imagination that's all let's just put it
[34:32] this way that's just all
[34:34] dirty and remember what we said before I
[34:36] don't know if you remember this but
[34:37] remember all that's what's in the past
[34:40] you don't have a memory of what you
[34:41] going to do tomorrow you have a memory
[34:43] of what you did in the past your
[34:46] reasoning is not on the future it's on
[34:48] what You' done in the past you reason on
[34:50] what you know about all right or think
[34:51] you think you know about your conscious
[34:54] what does your conscious do feeds on
[34:56] your path fast you don't have a
[34:57] conscious of what you do tomorrow cuz
[34:58] you haven't got there yet right now
[35:01] imagination you might be able to imagine
[35:03] things but how does that imagination
[35:04] come from it's what's built on what's
[35:06] from behind right and affection I can't
[35:10] love something I don't know anything
[35:11] about right I can't have affection for
[35:14] something I don't know about so it comes
[35:16] from what happens in the past so all
[35:18] this comes from past stuff but remember
[35:21] in the soul it's either Faith or
[35:24] doubt cut and dry w
[35:27] and remember faith is the substance of
[35:30] things hoped
[35:31] for the evidence of Things Not Seen out
[35:35] here so that's what you got to have
[35:37] faith for you got to have faith that you
[35:39] can do this if you don't have faith that
[35:41] you can do
[35:43] this then you stop the process it's just
[35:47] as simple as
[35:48] that you're the one that can make it all
[35:52] the way or not you're the only one
[35:55] nobody else can do it the way I see it
[35:58] God gives us Faith first and that faith
[36:01] is what we need the most because that's
[36:03] what pulls us sure you got to have faith
[36:06] in it if you don't have faith in it then
[36:08] why do it you got to have faith in that
[36:10] virtue that you got faith in that's what
[36:13] Peter he had faith in what he had for
[36:15] the time he had faith for the time he
[36:17] had faith in what he had he couldn't
[36:19] have faith in something he didn't have
[36:21] he had faith for what he had because he
[36:22] believed that that's what he had all
[36:24] right let's
[36:25] go
[36:33] so
