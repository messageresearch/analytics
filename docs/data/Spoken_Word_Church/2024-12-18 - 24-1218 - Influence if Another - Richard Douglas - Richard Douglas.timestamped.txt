[20:11] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6 start at verse
[20:14] one I'd like to take a little thought
[20:16] tonight the influence of
[20:20] another the influence of
[20:23] another says in the year the king Uzziah
[20:27] died I also o
[20:30] saw that I saw also the Lord sitting
[20:33] upon a
[20:34] throne and lifted up and his train
[20:38] filled the
[20:41] temple above it stood the serpens each
[20:44] one had six wings with Twain he covered
[20:47] his face and with Twain covered his feet
[20:51] and with Twain he did
[20:54] fly and one cried
[20:59] unto another and said
[21:01] holy
[21:02] holy is the Lord of
[21:05] hosts the whole earth think about this
[21:09] is full of his
[21:11] glory and the post of the doors moved at
[21:16] the voice of him that
[21:19] cried and the house was filled with
[21:23] smoke then said I woe is me for I am
[21:28] undone because I am a man of unclean
[21:32] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[21:36] people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[21:39] have seen the king the Lord of
[21:42] hosts then flew one of the syrups unto
[21:45] me having a live coal in his
[21:50] hand which he had taken with the tongs
[21:54] from off the Altar and he said and he
[21:56] laid it upon my mouth and said
[22:00] Lo this have touched thy
[22:03] lips and thine iniquity is taken away
[22:07] and thy sin purged also I heard the
[22:10] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[22:15] send and who will go for us then said I
[22:20] here am I send
[22:23] me oh
[22:25] Father Lord what a trembling EXP
[22:28] experience Lord to be in your presence
[22:30] here this evening Lord father realizing
[22:33] that Humanity has no power man has no
[22:38] ability he has nothing he can do nor
[22:41] nothing can he say father so father I
[22:44] Surrender myself Lord to you Lord You're
[22:47] the great speaker Lord You're The
[22:50] Interpreter of the word Lord you're the
[22:52] one that comes Lord and speaks through
[22:54] man Lord you made that choice you said
[22:57] I'll speak through man father we're your
[23:00] I'm here being your agent Lord father I
[23:03] pray father now that you Lord just move
[23:05] Lord move me out of your way Lord in
[23:09] such a way father that the people would
[23:11] not see a man but see God speaking
[23:15] through a man God that's what we come
[23:17] for Lord we're so hungry for you Lord
[23:20] we're so desirous of you Lord father we
[23:23] don't want to just send out just a mere
[23:25] invitation to you Lord we want want to
[23:28] make you welcome Lord we want you to be
[23:31] welcome we just don't want you to be a
[23:34] spectator we want you to take
[23:36] preeminence Lord now father move Lord
[23:40] come and speak to us Lord that's what
[23:42] we've come to hear Lord that we might
[23:44] receive Faith to press the battle Lord
[23:47] to keep going father we love you and we
[23:50] thank you for this opportunity father we
[23:52] ask you now Lord to help us in Jesus
[23:54] name I pray amen and amen you may be
[23:57] seated
[23:59] I like how the scriptures begins to read
[24:02] this and as I look at this I as a first
[24:05] verse in chapter six I look at this and
[24:08] it says in the year that King Uzziah
[24:10] died I would like to ask us a question
[24:13] tonight what king in your life do you
[24:17] need to die come on what king needs to
[24:20] pass away that is influencing you from
[24:24] being what you should be in Christ is it
[24:27] anxiety is it sickness is it
[24:31] discouragement whatever it is though it
[24:34] it took this because this King was such
[24:36] a holy king such a righteous King but it
[24:39] took this King Isaiah had his eyes on
[24:42] that King more than he had his eyes on
[24:45] God and when that King died then God was
[24:48] able to get him back in where he should
[24:51] be back on his Focus which is God as
[24:54] every man of God we must keep our Focus
[24:56] On Christ as Christians he is the
[24:59] preeminence he is everything in mine in
[25:01] your life he must be the complete focus
[25:04] of our life and it says and and when we
[25:07] get out of that it wasn't that Uzziah
[25:09] wasn't a good man but he got out of
[25:10] place he got to a place to where he was
[25:13] so exalted in himself God had blessed
[25:16] him in such a way that he thought he
[25:18] could do whatever he wanted to whenever
[25:20] he wanted to and whever you wanted to
[25:24] but you can't do that you still have an
[25:25] order that God has and God orders us us
[25:29] to follow in that order that's why God
[25:32] had to send us a prophet to put us in
[25:34] order that we might be able to be
[25:36] spoused to Christ as a Chase virgin
[25:39] there had to be an order there had to be
[25:41] a restoring back of the word it had to
[25:44] come back to the place had to bring us
[25:46] back to the faith of the fathers it
[25:48] wasn't that Faith was gone it's because
[25:50] brother Terence man had had moved us
[25:52] away from it right and moved us to his
[25:55] ideas just like Uzziah did he had an
[25:57] idea that he could become a priest but
[26:00] you know what he wouldn't he couldn't do
[26:02] that because that was not God's order
[26:05] and that's why he become with Leprosy
[26:07] which the Bible tells us that that's
[26:09] brother B told us that leprosy is not
[26:11] only a natural leprosy but a spiritual
[26:14] leprosy through the his Disobedience God
[26:17] tried to tell him you cannot do this and
[26:20] God had to take him away but I love how
[26:23] the Lord does I look at how this how we
[26:25] as we begin to look at this and he talks
[26:27] about all the reverence and coming into
[26:30] that presence and a lot of times we
[26:32] sometimes we come to the house of God
[26:34] just halfhearted and and just you know
[26:37] we just drag in and and drag out but we
[26:40] need to come with that expectation
[26:42] because we're not here the because of
[26:45] the building we're here because God's
[26:47] here we've come here for the purpose
[26:49] that God might speak to us and change us
[26:52] from what we are to a new and a better
[26:55] creature than we are than we are and I
[26:58] as I begin to look at this I begin to
[27:00] look at this and the power and the
[27:02] reverence in his I believe that's lost a
[27:05] lot of times around the message I don't
[27:07] know what a lot of people make the
[27:08] messages but the message is Jesus Christ
[27:12] if your message ain't Jesus Christ you
[27:14] missed it you missed it because brother
[27:16] BR said I come for one purpose I come
[27:19] here to build a platform that he might
[27:21] stand on brothers and sisters he didn't
[27:24] come for himself he come to point us
[27:27] back to Christ that's right back to the
[27:30] original word which is the Original Seed
[27:33] which brings the original life amen and
[27:36] as we look at that I like what it says
[27:38] that it says that when there was Angels
[27:40] was flying around there they covered
[27:42] they was covering everything in respect
[27:45] because there was such oh glory be to
[27:47] God I'm about to shout up here this
[27:48] morning this tonight there was such an
[27:51] influence of the Holiness of God that
[27:54] they covered themselves as in reverence
[27:57] to God amen oh hallelujah amen brother
[28:00] and they begin to say they begin to cry
[28:03] holy holy holy is the Lord God of host
[28:08] and it said it and it said when he
[28:11] spoke when his voice when this the
[28:13] doorpost touch power and the voice and
[28:18] the authority of God that's the way this
[28:20] word is amen this word is not a man this
[28:24] was God speaking through a man to us
[28:27] right said that the doorpost even Shook
[28:30] at the power of His voice and I believe
[28:33] that's what happened to me and you this
[28:34] message came out brother Terence and
[28:36] when it heard it hit the doorpost of our
[28:39] heart and we shook and it said wake up
[28:43] this is your call it is your time Rise
[28:46] and Shine for thy light has come glory
[28:50] be to
[28:51] God and then when he got into this when
[28:54] Isaiah got to this place he began to
[28:57] repent
[28:58] brother brother Brown said you can never
[29:00] go before God and not and talk about
[29:04] your brother or talk about your sister
[29:07] because when you get in the real
[29:08] presence of God you see how bad you need
[29:10] him and how dirty you are and how no
[29:13] good you are then you start praying oh
[29:16] God help me God help my brother God help
[29:19] my sister God help me he said woe is me
[29:24] he didn't say nothing about the children
[29:25] yet he said woe is me I'm a man undone
[29:30] with unclean lips among an unclean
[29:33] people he BR it back to himself but I
[29:36] love how the Lord was reing after the
[29:39] influence of Uzziah was there he come
[29:42] God sent an angel oh glory be to God did
[29:46] not we get an angel that was sent to our
[29:49] Prophet amen did he not do the same
[29:51] thing and bring him to that place he had
[29:54] to re there had to be an angel come and
[29:56] bring the restoration of the voice of
[29:58] God back through a
[30:00] man oh Hallelujah don't you love the
[30:03] word don't you thankful for this message
[30:07] people say I can take you just we just
[30:08] take the Bible you don't know nothing
[30:10] about the Bible I don't know nothing
[30:12] about the Bible God had to restore our
[30:15] knowledge and our understanding and
[30:17] bring us Revelation in the scriptures
[30:19] now the Bible brother Bob has become a
[30:22] new book amen amen glory be to God
[30:25] that's right so he took the with the
[30:28] tongues and took a coal the fire
[30:32] remember BR said a man should not be
[30:33] behind the pull pit unless he's met the
[30:35] pillar fire for itself that's why
[30:37] there's such a mess around the message
[30:40] is because men have not received the
[30:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost but see God
[30:45] had to set him in place in such a place
[30:48] that we could receive we could receive
[30:52] God in such a way oh Hallelujah see and
[30:56] when he did those things
[30:58] he
[30:59] said he said I am a I am a man of
[31:03] unclean lips for my eyes I've seen the
[31:06] king the Lord of hosts he said then one
[31:10] flew from the serpens and said unto
[31:13] me having a live Cal in his hand which
[31:16] is taken with the th with the tongs from
[31:19] off the Altar and he laid it upon my
[31:23] mouth and said Lo this have touched thy
[31:27] lips and thine iniquity has been taken
[31:31] away it takes God to take the iniquity
[31:34] out of a h out of our heart and out of
[31:37] our mouth remember James said the tongue
[31:40] is an unruly
[31:42] member he said they can't even the whale
[31:45] can't bring out sweet and bitter water
[31:48] but the tongue can curse and bless out
[31:50] of the same mouth and so he he needed to
[31:54] be Pur not there only there he said
[31:56] taking his iniquity away
[31:58] and thy sin
[32:01] purged though our sins be as Scarlet
[32:04] they're white as snow look at that then
[32:07] and then look God put him in service
[32:10] there had there had to be a there had to
[32:12] be a call he said in verse eight also I
[32:16] heard the voice of the
[32:18] Lord that's what brother Brown said
[32:20] that's what moves the bride she won't
[32:22] move unless she hears thus sayith the
[32:24] Lord said I heard the voice of the Lord
[32:27] saying whom shall I send who will go
[32:30] forth he could not receive his
[32:33] Commission in being service the proper
[32:36] way until he had went through this
[32:39] transformation in his life then the
[32:42] commission
[32:43] become very Supernatural important to
[32:47] him right then he could walk in like God
[32:50] wanted him to walk in he could speak
[32:52] like God wanted to speak he could live
[32:54] like God wanted you to live and I love
[32:56] how he said that I remember that as the
[32:58] Lord was dealing with me stepping into
[33:00] the ministry and the Lord kept bringing
[33:03] this scripture back to me about going
[33:06] you know and you always claim well you
[33:07] know can't talk I'm I'm always nervous
[33:10] around people and I ain't a good speaker
[33:13] but he don't want to hear none of that
[33:15] that's right he just wants you to
[33:16] surrender to him he wants you to get in
[33:18] there and get the Holy Ghost in your
[33:20] heart he said I'll put words in your
[33:22] mouth
[33:23] Richard I'll speak through you you don't
[33:26] need I don't need you I need you to
[33:29] surrender all I need you to do is
[33:31] completely trust me put your whole
[33:33] confidence in me then he said who'll go
[33:37] for us then Isaiah said I'll go send me
[33:42] see in order for us to complete the
[33:44] Commission in our lives there must be a
[33:48] death there must be a death there must
[33:50] be a dying out there must be a killing
[33:53] to bring us to that place and he had to
[33:55] be kill that influence that he had and
[33:58] that influence that he had over over
[34:02] Isaiah listen to what the prophet said
[34:04] and the prophet said a lot of good
[34:05] things about uzai but he made some
[34:08] mistakes look at what I love how the
[34:10] prophet in the message influence of
[34:12] another he said now influence we find
[34:14] out that uah's life influenced this
[34:18] Prophet right until until such a place
[34:22] that uzzi rather built walls and
[34:25] strengthened himself and took back
[34:27] grounds and possessions that belonged to
[34:30] them from the Philistines so forth until
[34:33] his Fame went all the way to Egypt and I
[34:37] tell you of all the all the chronicles
[34:40] of the Kings there was none of them
[34:42] outside of Solomon that spread forth
[34:45] like Uzziah did then he puts a question
[34:48] he says why why was this because he was
[34:51] doing what God say when we do what God
[34:53] says God abases and God exalts and man
[34:58] he said because he set look at this
[35:00] brother and sisters as Christians we are
[35:02] here to set an example to this world
[35:05] that Christ is still alive he says
[35:08] because he set the example he stayed
[35:11] with God no matter what his people
[35:14] thought what anybody else thought what
[35:17] he what the politicians tried to
[35:18] influence him he stayed directly with
[35:21] God and God blessed him it was a great
[35:25] help to the young Prophet cuz he was
[35:27] learning he was being influenced by
[35:30] obedience Hallelujah and that's what
[35:33] that we need to be influenced by God ask
[35:36] us to be
[35:38] obedient and as we look at this in the
[35:40] same message brother begins to speak
[35:41] says now but when this King got to a
[35:45] place there's a place brother Bob
[35:48] sometimes we get to a place there's a
[35:50] Crossroads come on there's a place where
[35:52] we follow still follow God or we start
[35:55] following our own will we get get to the
[35:57] place where we're so lifted up we get to
[36:00] so place where we think we got so much
[36:01] power brother Aaron so we think we can
[36:03] do whatever we want to say whatever we
[36:05] want to and God will still back us but
[36:07] he don't do it he only backs his
[36:10] word he said got to got to a certain
[36:13] place being such a great man and
[36:17] influencing Isaiah and the righteousness
[36:21] of course of his kingdom listen to what
[36:24] Welly this is I love this little I love
[36:26] these little nuggets he said he got to a
[36:29] place he got to feeling self secured
[36:34] come on that's right brother that's
[36:36] where we mess up we get to the place
[36:39] think we're all right I've got so far
[36:41] I'm all right now I don't I don't need
[36:44] no more ain't that what this age has
[36:46] done Satan wants to get you to that
[36:48] place where you think yourself secured
[36:50] that's
[36:52] right you know what self-secure means
[36:56] feeling secure in oneself or one's
[36:59] position dangerous place to be I'm
[37:03] realizing that we the reason we are
[37:05] righteousness is because we're in
[37:09] him he became our sin that we might
[37:12] become his righteousness he said listen
[37:15] to this and there is where you make your
[37:18] mistake when you get to the place where
[37:20] your self secure he said there is where
[37:23] so many righteous men bite the dust of
[37:26] Shame
[37:28] preachers prophets
[37:31] teachers sons of God Daughters of God we
[37:36] get
[37:36] self-secure get
[37:40] complacent satisfied well I've been in
[37:42] the message 340 years that don't mean
[37:44] nothing Satan wants you to get secure in
[37:47] what you've done how long you stay you
[37:49] ain't been here that long God has kept
[37:52] you here that long God has secured you
[37:55] God has kept you amen
[37:58] he said bite the dust of Shame bite the
[38:01] dust of defeat is because they begin to
[38:04] feel
[38:05] self-secure you begin to think that you
[38:07] have lived so long in Christ that no
[38:12] matter what he presents before you
[38:15] you'll take your choice whether whether
[38:19] you want whether he wants it or
[38:22] not that's right choices choices see Jo
[38:27] Joshua come to a place he come down
[38:29] there told him he said you got to choose
[38:31] today who you going to serve you're
[38:34] going to serve the gods of Egypt are you
[38:37] going to serve God he said ask I love
[38:39] how he did that he was so personal to
[38:41] him brother he said ask of me in my
[38:44] house will serve the Lord amen y'all all
[38:47] walk away y all go on the websites
[38:50] that's all right none of these things
[38:53] move
[38:55] me glory be to God
[38:58] he said you've got to continue to serve
[39:01] God no matter what you was back 10 years
[39:04] ago he said it's what you are now the
[39:07] king got to a place that he thought
[39:09] within himself that he got lifted up
[39:13] listen to what brother Bram says about
[39:14] this Pride got in his heart ain't that
[39:16] what caused Satan to fall yeah iniquity
[39:19] proud brothers and sister we got a lot
[39:22] of proud people you know what I'm proud
[39:24] of Christ amen I have nothing to offer
[39:28] him except my surrender to his
[39:31] will complete obedience to his word he
[39:34] said and that's what happens to us he
[39:38] said if you'll pardon this expression
[39:39] that's what happens to our church
[39:42] throughout the
[39:43] Country Pride what is pride pride is a
[39:47] feeling of deep pleasure or
[39:50] satisfactions in one's own achievements
[39:54] ain't that where Satan got to oh yeah
[39:56] Satan got power he said look at here
[39:59] look boy I'm telling you a can't nobody
[40:01] play music like me ain't nobody get this
[40:03] worship service going better watch it
[40:07] better watch
[40:09] it you better be getting your bringing
[40:11] your worship to God Amen not to yourself
[40:15] we're not here to put on a show we're
[40:17] not here to show our abilities or our
[40:19] talents if we bring any other worship
[40:22] than worship to God we're in
[40:24] trouble we see this in festing the
[40:28] message bringing in worldly
[40:31] music worldly
[40:33] beats take it from a man knows I was
[40:35] right in that stuff and people say
[40:38] sometimes I'm too hard on people say you
[40:40] harp on I said I'm not I ain't got a
[40:42] problem with
[40:43] worship if it's worship God if it brings
[40:46] you to the see the word the music comes
[40:49] to get you ready for the word amen
[40:52] amen it don't come for no other reason
[40:55] amen amen It prepares you
[40:57] for the word To Go For It prepares you
[40:59] for the battle it gets your what it does
[41:02] it drives away your self-will and your
[41:05] self ideas that you might enter into
[41:07] God's word amen
[41:11] amen we realized that
[41:14] every
[41:16] every everything is motivated by spirit
[41:20] amen that's why he tells us in 1 John 4
[41:23] beloved believe not every Spirit brother
[41:26] man said you can have everything hey
[41:28] I've been to ball games and there's
[41:29] anointings there amen anointing there's
[41:33] an anointing for that stuff went to
[41:35] concerts there was anointing there
[41:38] wasn't anointing to God but it was
[41:39] anointing you could it affected you
[41:41] brother's parents it affect you right
[41:45] does it but it didn't affect me to serve
[41:47] God it affected me to
[41:49] sin right it affected me in such a way I
[41:52] thought I was okay but the when the real
[41:56] true worship come comes and the real it
[41:58] gets you the place to start to repent
[42:00] and saying God face anything going on
[42:02] right now before the word comes cleans
[42:05] me that's right make me whole amen I
[42:07] don't want nothing to hinder this
[42:08] service somebody might need healing God
[42:11] somebody might need Deliverance father
[42:13] let there be nothing between me and you
[42:16] but the blood of Jesus Christ amen he
[42:19] said believe not every Spirit but try
[42:21] the spirits whether they're of God or
[42:23] not because false prophets are gone out
[42:26] into the world brother Brown said
[42:29] anything that's anti- word is
[42:32] Antichrist and you know what I love how
[42:34] the prophet Mak so simple to us brother
[42:35] B he said you want to know where a man
[42:37] stands give the word to us I've never
[42:40] seen so many people brother they get mad
[42:42] when you tell them what the word says
[42:44] you tell them what the prophet they get
[42:45] offended by I said how how can you tell
[42:47] me you've been born in the spirit of God
[42:48] and the word of God offends you right I
[42:51] said either you got a wrong Spirit or
[42:53] you've never had his spirit either way
[42:55] you need Deliverance
[42:58] amen glory be to
[43:00] God and see the Lord showed me this
[43:03] about
[43:04] music first thing that Satan
[43:06] did was his music changed brother
[43:10] Terence then the worship changed when
[43:12] the music changed the worship changes
[43:14] brother B and then when the worship
[43:16] changed guess what his Doctrine said he
[43:17] said I'll exalt myself above God I'll
[43:22] set in the synagogues of God and be
[43:24] worshiped as God and said iniquity he
[43:27] was found in his heart he was Pride he
[43:29] was such a preacher and so influential
[43:32] imagine that here is onethird of the
[43:34] angels that never knew nothing but God
[43:37] and here's an here's one here's another
[43:40] angel that tells them you need me if you
[43:43] don't need God right ain't that the way
[43:46] a lot of Ministries get you need me in
[43:49] order for you to make it you we we need
[43:51] a pastor we need a Shepherd we need a
[43:53] man but we follow him as he follows
[43:55] Christ when he gets away from the word
[43:57] we have to get away from him amen no try
[44:01] every
[44:03] spirit I like what the prophet said in
[44:05] the German Spirit 1960 he said you're
[44:08] trying to achieve something a true
[44:10] prophet of God a true teacher is trying
[44:13] to bring the church to a Unity of spirit
[44:16] a Unity of spirit that they may
[44:18] recognize God boy I love that right
[44:20] don't you same message he say so if you
[44:24] see a person with a great gift gift
[44:27] trying to do something to glorify
[44:30] themselves he said your own discernment
[44:33] of the spirit tells you that's
[44:36] wrong it's wrong if any man gets up and
[44:40] tries to bring glory to himself right
[44:42] he's motivated by the wrong Spirit he's
[44:44] influenced by something besides God
[44:47] because hey he even when they come to
[44:49] when they come and tried to worship Paul
[44:52] and
[44:54] Barnabas like said they were some kind
[44:56] of gods or you know they stripped their
[44:59] clothes said hey humans only worship god
[45:04] brother said a true man of God will
[45:06] never accept worship that's
[45:09] right and that's the biggest thing Satan
[45:12] tries to do with this man he tries to
[45:13] tell people brother brother Bob brother
[45:16] he tries to tell people they're
[45:17] following the man they're worshiping the
[45:21] man see that's what he makes them think
[45:23] they're doing but you know what they're
[45:25] worshiping something to S and don't even
[45:26] realize it they're worshiping Satan and
[45:28] don't even realize they think they're
[45:29] worshiping God you only there's only two
[45:32] Spirits you can worship that's God or
[45:35] the devil those are the two influences
[45:38] if anything influences you anything to
[45:40] worship anything besides God you're in
[45:42] trouble sometimes PE some sometimes
[45:44] people's job becomes such an influence
[45:46] oh yeah I get tickled at people
[45:49] sometimes they'll say boy God give me
[45:51] this car but you know what I can't come
[45:53] to church on Wednesday night no more cuz
[45:54] I got to work to pay for this thing I'm
[45:56] having to work
[45:57] workover God never pushes you out of
[45:59] church when he gives you
[46:01] something God gives you stuff without
[46:04] stipulations yes he does anything to go
[46:08] contrary to his word because the word of
[46:09] God says forsake not the assembling of
[46:11] yourselves together even more so not
[46:15] less so people are getting where they
[46:17] only go to church once a week now around
[46:20] this message got one man got one church
[46:22] service sad amen I stared to death eat
[46:27] one time a week and see how long you
[46:29] last right same thing natural is just
[46:32] spiritual sir amen that's why you got so
[46:35] many people that's deprived because they
[46:39] don't and man and one thing why don't
[46:42] you eat during the week
[46:45] too amen he said you want to get close
[46:47] to God read your Bible and pray people
[46:49] say oh god brother pray that I'll get
[46:51] closer to God said just follow what he
[46:53] said yeah I'll pray for you but just
[46:55] read your Bible and pray am I can't be
[46:58] your Holy
[47:00] Ghost amen you got to get it for
[47:03] yourself amen you got to have a hunger
[47:05] in there if there's something
[47:07] influencing you not to read your Bible
[47:09] and not to pray that's not God because
[47:12] the Holy Ghost feeds off the word and
[47:15] the Holy Ghost loves fellowship with his
[47:18] father that's right
[47:21] amen listen to
[47:23] this same message influence of another
[47:27] she could see they live no different
[47:29] life than what she did well what about
[47:32] that it says it takes influence it takes
[47:36] the power of the resurrection of Christ
[47:38] amongst the people that they see that
[47:41] Christ is not a statue hanging in a
[47:46] building he's a living being in the form
[47:49] of the Holy Ghost living in men and
[47:52] women bringing
[47:54] peace not worry amen not doubt not
[47:59] discouragement bringing peace he said
[48:01] I'll give unto you my peace oh my sister
[48:06] D what about that my peace that the
[48:09] world knows nothing up you can't get a
[48:11] pill that'll give you what God gives
[48:15] you give me peace that surpasses on what
[48:18] are we going to do next year when all
[48:19] this I don't know I don't know what
[48:22] tomorrow holds you don't know what
[48:24] tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds
[48:26] Tomorrow
[48:27] he said take no thought for
[48:29] tomorrow I've already got your tomorrow
[48:33] planned glory be to God he knew you he
[48:36] said Jeremiah I knew you and chose you
[48:40] before the foundation of world I called
[48:42] you predestinated you elected you for
[48:46] this hour amen he built you to be here
[48:48] in Leo deia and do you know what I heard
[48:52] one brother said you know if we had know
[48:53] the hend of this thing we'd have
[48:54] volunteered but brother Bob I believe we
[48:56] did volunteer come on cuz I believe just
[48:59] like Isaiah we was there in theophany
[49:03] there in the thoughts of God and he said
[49:04] who go down in Leo to see you we said
[49:07] we'll go we don't remember it but we're
[49:09] starting to remember we come from there
[49:11] we're going back it's coming closer and

[1:04:11] let's start right here verse
[1:04:13] five listen this for when we were in the
[1:04:17] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[1:04:20] the law did work in our members to bring
[1:04:23] forth fruit of unto death right he said
[1:04:27] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:04:30] being dead wherein we were Hil that we
[1:04:36] should serve in newness of spirit that
[1:04:39] not in the oldness of the
[1:04:42] letter what shall we say
[1:04:44] then is the law sin God
[1:04:48] forbid he said nay the law for I had not
[1:04:53] known lust except the law had said Thou
[1:04:56] shalt not covet boy I love the word I
[1:05:00] love this message I said you know what
[1:05:02] made me love this message come right out
[1:05:03] of this
[1:05:05] Bible you know what this message made me
[1:05:07] do fall in love with
[1:05:09] him I'm so in love with him I don't want
[1:05:11] to do anything to bring shame to him
[1:05:15] that's right or to be a stumbling block
[1:05:16] I want to be so salty that somebody will
[1:05:20] get thirsty for the true and living
[1:05:22] God he said but he said but but sin
[1:05:26] taken occasion by the Commandment
[1:05:29] wrought in me all manner of consensus he
[1:05:33] said for without the law sin was
[1:05:37] dead what about that for I was alive
[1:05:42] without the law once he's talking about
[1:05:44] the inward man right here now he's going
[1:05:45] to tell you you're still going to have
[1:05:46] troubles oh I love this beautiful he
[1:05:49] said but when the Commandment came sin
[1:05:54] revived and I
[1:05:58] died oh Hallelujah by one man's
[1:06:02] Disobedience we died but by one man's
[1:06:06] obedience we
[1:06:08] live glory be to God he said for sin
[1:06:12] keeping occasion by the Commandment
[1:06:14] deceived me and by it slew me I love
[1:06:19] that brother B he said wherein the law
[1:06:22] is hell is Holy and
[1:06:25] the Commandment is Holy and just and
[1:06:28] good he said was then that which is good
[1:06:31] made death unto me God forbid he said
[1:06:34] but sin that might appear sin working
[1:06:38] death in Me by which is good that sin by
[1:06:43] the Commandment might become exceedingly
[1:06:47] sinful showing us that we was dead in
[1:06:50] sins and
[1:06:51] trespasses nothing did we have to give
[1:06:54] him but Obed Obi total
[1:06:58] surrender glory be to God listen to this

[1:09:20] said now if I do that I would not it is
[1:09:23] no more I that do it but sin that
[1:09:26] dwelleth in me talking about that
[1:09:29] contrast that Warfare between them two
[1:09:31] dogs he said I find that then a law that
[1:09:36] when I would do good evil is present
[1:09:40] with
[1:09:41] me it wasn't talking about Silas he
[1:09:45] wasn't talking about Barnabas Paul's
[1:09:47] talking about his flesh amen your
[1:09:49] greatest enemy is your flesh brother
[1:09:53] Brown says William Brand's greatest
[1:09:55] enemy is William Brandon and people want
[1:09:57] to
[1:09:58] worship I said why would you want to wor
[1:10:00] brother Brand's greatest enemy his flesh
[1:10:03] we worship the god William Brown oh
[1:10:07] hallelujah what about that when
[1:10:10] I when I would do good evil is present
[1:10:14] with me he said for I Delight in the law
[1:10:17] of God after the inward man boy I
[1:10:19] rejoice in it brother I said oh boy I
[1:10:22] keep looking in the mirror brother B I'm
[1:10:23] said get the best of you want one of
[1:10:25] these days I'm going to starve you to
[1:10:28] death boy you ain't getting nothing
[1:10:31] that's what we get in trouble we feed
[1:10:32] him then one why we got trouble well you
[1:10:34] don't have to get him but this a Crum
[1:10:35] boy he'll raise
[1:10:38] up he said oh I love this look right
[1:10:41] here he tells us that he said for I
[1:10:43] Delight in the law of God after the
[1:10:45] inward man but I see another law in my
[1:10:47] members Waring against the law of my
[1:10:50] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:10:53] the law of sin which is in my members
[1:10:55] he's talking about this
[1:10:58] now he said oh Wretched
[1:11:01] Man that I am who shall deliver me from
[1:11:05] this body of death of this death oh he
[1:11:08] get the answer right here don't he he
[1:11:10] said I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:11:12] Our Lord woo so then with the mind I
[1:11:17] serve myself I I myself serve the law of
[1:11:21] God but with the flesh the law of sin
[1:11:27] amen and then look what he says right
[1:11:29] there after he tells you all that right
[1:11:31] there in the next chapter in chapter 8
[1:11:34] verse one what does he tell you telling
[1:11:36] you you got the victory this man's
[1:11:39] coming under subject one of these days
[1:11:41] that's right he said therefore there is
[1:11:43] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:11:46] Christ Jesus who walk not Oh
[1:11:51] my he said my eyes messing with me he
[1:11:54] said therefore that now there is no
[1:11:56] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:11:58] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:12:00] after the spirit amen ain't that the
[1:12:04] truth what is our greatest adversary
[1:12:08] mine's Richard
[1:12:10] Douglas Aron is Aaron Roberts Bob black
[1:12:13] is Bob black his worst enemy that old
[1:12:16] boy you look you wash him you wash that
[1:12:18] pig all the time he still
[1:12:20] oinks pinch him he a
[1:12:23] squeal people say I got my subjection
[1:12:26] mask your finger and act like an idiot
[1:12:28] it don't sound like it to me hey it's
[1:12:31] spiritual ignorance really only thing
[1:12:34] brings him under subjection is the Holy
[1:12:35] Ghost that's right keeps him got got a
[1:12:37] Bridal in there you I love it when you
[1:12:39] go to say something go say don't you do
[1:12:41] that boy and then when you do he said
[1:12:43] you know better than that I said Thank
[1:12:46] You Lord I know better than that but
[1:12:47] look at the influence remember Abram
[1:12:50] talked about that when he
[1:12:51] remember you
[1:12:53] remember we got influ we got we're
[1:12:56] striving between there's two Spirits
[1:12:58] yeah it's the spirit of Richard and the
[1:13:01] spirit of
[1:13:03] God this is the spirit of
[1:13:06] Richard oh my goodness
[1:13:12] hallelujah it's a
[1:13:14] Warfare you're
[1:13:16] influenced by another I'm glad the
[1:13:18] influence of God overriding the
[1:13:21] influence of this amen he said therefore
[1:13:24] now there is no condemnation to them who
[1:13:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:13:31] spirit this man must die Paul said I Die
[1:13:36] daily he didn't say he was dead yet he
[1:13:39] said I'm dying daily he said when I was
[1:13:41] a child I thought I was a child we got
[1:13:43] people in church they get mad at one
[1:13:45] another won't even speak to one
[1:13:47] another Jesus said unless you come as a
[1:13:50] little child you going come remember we
[1:13:52] get mad I know you and Aaron rich they
[1:13:55] used to fight like cash and dogs I can
[1:13:57] tell them cuz I
[1:14:02] remember but you know what they're still
[1:14:04] brothers that's right but you didn't
[1:14:06] jump on one without having to fight the
[1:14:08] other that's
[1:14:10] right hey you think God's going to let
[1:14:12] Satan jump on you without having to
[1:14:13] fight God if he don't get permission he
[1:14:16] can't jump on you that's right don't
[1:14:18] fool yourself he only does that because
[1:14:20] he gets permission satake can only do
[1:14:21] anything to you brother Paul unless God
[1:14:23] lets him to it yes got perit we don't
[1:14:25] understand some we'll say oh God why is
[1:14:27] this happen I said God you allowed this
[1:14:29] to happen but God give me Grace to get
[1:14:31] through it give me Grace not to Grumble
[1:14:33] complain and murmur and all that right
[1:14:36] but there's a Warfare between those two
[1:14:38] two
[1:14:40] Spirits see when you was born again that
[1:14:43] Spirit of influence in your soul that
[1:14:45] wrong nature that old Spirit of the
[1:14:47] Beast that lived in there with that
[1:14:51] thing died but this thing didn't die
[1:14:55] yeah you know but still you got that
[1:14:56] brother Brown said the greatest battle
[1:14:58] ever fought he said that spirit is now
[1:15:01] gone from in here control but it comes
[1:15:04] back up to here a place of influence and
[1:15:07] he's still talking oh Bob you ain't
[1:15:09] going to make it man you fooling you man
[1:15:11] who you trying to you a hypocrite Bob
[1:15:14] knows I'm not piting up I'm just using
[1:15:16] that's what he tells me he says you
[1:15:19] ain't going to make it but you know what
[1:15:20] I got a word for him brother Terence
[1:15:22] whatever he says is a lie what God says
[1:15:25] the truth brother said whatever Satan
[1:15:27] tells you you take the opposite he come
[1:15:30] to a place of
[1:15:31] influence he talks brother said right
[1:15:33] there he said God chose this because he
[1:15:36] lives there now amen the Supreme control
[1:15:39] he said as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:15:41] man thinks oh my God how can a heart
[1:15:43] think by they prove now that it can
[1:15:46] there's a little spot in there that
[1:15:49] there stops
[1:15:50] in and the only reason you're overcoming
[1:15:53] because that voice in there that has
[1:15:56] quickened that seed that's telling you
[1:15:57] greater is he is in you and he is in
[1:16:00] this world greater is he that's in you
[1:16:03] than he that's in this
[1:16:05] world oh
[1:16:08] my but he lost that place of influence
[1:16:10] can I read you something I'm going try
[1:16:12] try to finish that know time's flying
[1:16:14] stomach's growling it's raining that's
[1:16:16] all right there still in the house of
[1:16:19] God listen to this this is in the
[1:16:22] revelation of Jesus Christ the church
[1:16:23] his book he said he can cannot stand it
[1:16:26] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:16:28] Revelation right of the true church and
[1:16:33] what she is see Satan don't want you to
[1:16:36] know who you are because when you know
[1:16:37] who you are you get in your position and
[1:16:40] in your position Satan is powerless
[1:16:42] against
[1:16:43] you he don't want you to know that he
[1:16:45] said and what she stands for and that
[1:16:49] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:16:52] an invincible Army if they get a true
[1:16:55] revelation of the two Spirits can I do
[1:16:58] it like this right here in this
[1:17:01] framework God Satan God
[1:17:05] Satan the two Spirits working with the
[1:17:08] framework of the Christian what's the
[1:17:09] Christian church is this no you're not
[1:17:12] you're the temple let's go to spiritual
[1:17:14] brother BR said everything natural tou
[1:17:15] spiritual amen this is you're the church
[1:17:19] he said no you're not you are the
[1:17:20] temple sister Dale you're the temple
[1:17:24] that's the temple Le right
[1:17:26] there look at that he said in the
[1:17:29] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:17:31] God's grace discern between when it's
[1:17:34] Richard talking and it's God talking
[1:17:37] brother ter Satan don't want you to
[1:17:38] realize
[1:17:39] that he said and discern he said by
[1:17:43] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:17:45] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:17:49] powerless before her yeah
[1:17:53] amen what did what the prophet tells he
[1:17:55] said in the Millennium Satan will be
[1:17:57] powerless he'll be bound by change he
[1:18:00] said not change he said he won't have
[1:18:02] nobody to work through I'm asking God
[1:18:04] brother ter Lord let me not be worked by
[1:18:07] Satan that's right let me do you know
[1:18:09] brother said you get to a place where
[1:18:10] Satan don't know what to do with you
[1:18:13] think about that he don't know what to
[1:18:15] do with you because you ain't listening
[1:18:17] to you no
[1:18:19] more Discerning between your feelings
[1:18:23] and your desires
[1:18:25] and God's spirit when you when your
[1:18:28] feelings come against anything God's
[1:18:30] word says that's not God that's
[1:18:35] Richard and when you can say oh Richard
[1:18:38] don't you try that no more huh so you're
[1:18:41] not feeding him no more you're the one
[1:18:42] we're the one that gives him power cuz
[1:18:45] we when we obey him who you serve you're
[1:18:49] you're a slave to that's why Paul said
[1:18:52] I'm a
[1:18:53] prisoner to Jesus Christ Christ amen I
[1:18:55] don't care if they locked me up I don't
[1:18:57] care if they beat me I'm still Jesus's
[1:18:59] I'm a love slave to Jesus Christ ain't
[1:19:02] that wonderful what about that as we
[1:19:04] stand when we get to the place that we
[1:19:07] can discern between those two Spirits
[1:19:09] working in this this church this is his
[1:19:13] church he come back for a body what's
[1:19:15] his body we're his body when we can
[1:19:18] realize that brother Aaron he's work
[1:19:21] Satan's working too that's why Paul said
[1:19:23] when I go do good Evil's pray has it
[1:19:25] he's saying Paul who shall deliver me
[1:19:28] from this old Wretched Man that I am
[1:19:30] amen amen a born again holy spirit of
[1:19:34] God Quicken that sea can deliver you
[1:19:36] from this man ain't you glad you
[1:19:38] wouldn't have discernment that's why
[1:19:39] when your your flesh would do something
[1:19:41] your heart say that's good I like that
[1:19:43] when he wasn't born again but now when
[1:19:44] something like happen you say man I'm
[1:19:46] getting down repent that flesh said I
[1:19:47] didn't I was nothing wrong with that I
[1:19:49] said oh yes it was you said something
