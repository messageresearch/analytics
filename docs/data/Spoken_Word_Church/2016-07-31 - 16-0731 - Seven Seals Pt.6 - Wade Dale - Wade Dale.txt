========================================

let's add a wonderful wait you're talking about it we have a wonderfully good we good we yeah well we did more than that you gotta get out you can't do something from try it I'm sorry all right revelation 6 1 we're going to start now don't you look right here what I got Mohammed there is uh this is this is what we need to look at all right it's what I wanted to talk about or talked about last Sunday well we're talking about this Sunday yeah I'm single all right because there's a big contention in the message on some people now sometimes when we say that you think high informations believe that knowledge you're certain little pieces or parts of people they believe that the seals are close of course that's the group that believes that brother grounds got to come back and open them in that little room and open the sealed and we get the Holy Ghost when we go on the rafter night that's just an overview all right but now I truly believe that close because if it's not revealed to you it's closed run ok so the seals are open / close because the lemme and you say well they're open to me let me ask you a question I thought the seals were for the redemption of the body and as soon as we see all seven seals in our bodies change back so as the seals all open to you yeah right why I tell you when we read these when brother Brad preached them if the if the if the Rennick the full revelation had come into part at that time into being at that time then one of a rapture taking place okay so now we're 50 years down the road we're still reading the seal book we're still listening to the seals we have a pretty different preachers brother Claude preaching on it now he's preach 67 Thurman zones and he's only honest thing sealed so he's he's you know diggin being pretty good pretty deep Odell next 60 some herbs in 1982 so we've got people that are preaching them but the revelation is there but having us told you last week let's read around here and then I'll then I'll explain something to you and maybe it'll help you because that we need some help and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals revelation 6 1 and I heard as it were the noise of thunder right one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw behold a white horse and he the sound of him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer all right that is the opening of the steel in the Bible right that's the opening of the seal in the Bible oh my god thats a man because what and i saw when the lamb opened one less thing on the Bible tells you it was open okay and I heard it worth north of thunder program watch that one is the thunders the voice of God when the seal is being made known or broke okay at Eric tour back all right there's a thunder go down hey and heard it was a noise one of the thunder and one of the four be so see what is one of the four beasts saying what is one of the four beef doesn't matter which one it is we know the lion with the per stage company agent but there had to be something come from the Beast to join being a top John top of his bride right the lamb didn't say John come and see the lamb broke the seal the thunder went out and one of the four beasts which is the type of the black not really a type it is the holyoke the four beasts is the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost has to tell you come and see then what you John dude and I saw now John wrote when he saw that John had the baptism of the Holy goat but he was not commissioned to give the revelation of this right right okay he was commissioned to write what he saw right John brought these things and give them to the seven churches okay and that's what he did and I saw and behold a white horse and he had sent him how to vote crown get on him went for cup and incumbent there's your symbols many down through the ages have probed at it clams Larkin did preach that this was the Antichrist okay but remember the others listen what I said clamps like the one the problem to the end time he didn't I loose ends together he was still a Trinitarian he still had Trinitarian idea he still see his background was denominationalism so he didn't he come out to a degree but he didn't come all the way out remember brother Brown said they come out through the ages but they didn't go all the way out what they didn't have enough to change buddy so Claire so I can look at this and through the Holy Ghost he got a revelation okay but then when the prophet of God comes he gets the full revelation because brother Brown said one co ty the entire Bible together all right right here this will kind of the entire Bible you will see Clarence Larkin wasn't one that would say this is going to tie the entire Bible together and I no brother branham was commissioned by God himself to come back to jeffersonville and to preach these seals right okay and I believe they open to the product okay but they did not open to the people he be preaching to right man they didn't open to the people who've recently they thought they might of got some a living but we're 50 years down the road and peeling it back you know the onion peel so the lamb opened the seal then we see that the Holy Ghost has to tell you to come and see right that's the whole year I proposed in there cuz rook the steel is the Holy go hey we're not tearing physical sealed off a book okay what you're doing so is the book where the book and the Holy Ghost is revealing what us what we are revealing to us do we are what we are what we're doing here front which is which was which is which is to come night and for one of the four beasts being the Holy Ghost said coming see and I saw jon said he wrote down a white horse that went out goddammit like say we come down to Clarence Larkin who have a revelation of his town and then we have that man pretty much you know sealed it back off and denominational ideas then we had to have a profit come along and give us all the way out of that mess the brand's all the way out okay but for the ones you just came in there's contention in the message that the seals are closed and the program's got to come back and open them to us I agree with that to a degree brother Graham don't have to come back but he lays laying in the message that he already creek and the seals are open because the Bible says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so we oh that the seals according to what God is looking at are open correct but brother Louisa I was telling them asking them before the question this was preached in 1963 if the full revelation of the seals had been made known in 1963 the rapture order took place in the 92 the seventh seal on the next morning that's what this for program safety sales are for rapture in faith all right why are we still here 50 years later because they are closed until you get a full revelation they're open we know for a fact it's in there we're not waiting for some person to come and open a force front because no man can open that book except that lamb if you don't how to ollie go you know to understand them anyway and even with the Holy go man has been confused down through time and now we come down to the end time and we have the filter of the ministers coming out which is the for beef the line aux man illegal the holy ghost in the believers now trying to not reopen them but explain one open web rodel come about not interpret man is interpreted and got it wrong but if it comes from God straight from God to the Holy Ghost your filter into you there's an explanation of what's going on what God's already done okay he's explaining himself because you're not going to change the word where I'm going to change the prophets message just like in am 70 weeks we never change the Bible we never change the properties message we have to take a quote output one end we didn't have to skip a Bible verse alright we truly understand I believe now Daniel 70 weeks and how it all ties together so I hope and praises we can do that with the seals right and it's not it's like I said before you got to give you a revelation I don't want brother brown now look honestly brother branham's revelation of these seals all right his revelation of these seals is the true revelation of god there's no one else we need to come and bring in young tell ones thing but he's in a grave waiting on somebody to catch that revelation have enough wrapped ring faith to take him and all the other cages out of the ground yes overwhelmed the grave and braver layout death will be swallowed up the model seven victories swallowed up in victory alright so that's what we've got to see so truly they are closed but you gotta remember we're looking at an open book so it's not something we're waiting for somebody to come in reopen the bandstand that we're not reopening or are redefining or redesigning the Bible in the seals we just got to understand what are you talking about yes and then we got to understand what you ought to take that is that like that onion peeled you know it is open but if you don't get too real the truth i'm talking about the full revelation to me if you get the full revelation the seven seals that's the entire Bible revealed as it should have been had they not been fall okay that's just to me that to me that's what the seals mean to me if they're all broke and they're all open and the full revelations come out then to me that's Adam standing back in the garden before the fall the man the Holy Ghost ruling and reigning over the earth through a man named Adam right a man in Jesus Christ the second out then where were to be the what the second date the man and then brother Brown said that he was going to prove to Satan that this eve width all okay something there would the fall so you never felt the truly you never felt that Genesis 1 26 men never found a man that's what we got to understand that when we down at the end of time we come all the way down here and we've got to see something not different than everybody else soft same Bible it was whoo you know thousand years ago they put together a thousand years ago for a man to read same Bible man has ready to script for millions of times but there's somebody going to catch the true real revelation of what the prophet of God was saying and not just that the white horse riders Antichrist now if that's the only revelation of this first feel their brother Graham you can read it on a piece of paper there right this book contains the opening of the seals while I was doing while we're still here be revealed we must get a revelation for ourself of what these seals mean not contrary to the Bible not contrary to the prophets message we can't make it polygamy or our seventh under virtually all those different doctrines we can't make Norman the mega twin brother sorry and that brings up a point because to me the seals have no carnality of man in it I mean really has no car I mean if you take seven sent over the Seventh Seal is polygamy listen that's that's a natural act done in a sinful world and you think that's got something to do with them and that's the purest opening of the word has ever been and you're going to throw you know your bodily lust and all that you know I mean you know one thing if it drives you to the flesh it's definitely not a god very hidden commander collide always gonna have to deal with this guy and turn him back turn him back or her back to the original where Adam tables in the garden and walking in the cool didn't talk right so if you take anything of carnality of this message and you put it in here 0 NE of opening of whatever and you hear somebody talk about well it's eating grapes and this having four wives in this is you know it's do you know something carnal or something natural now this is the most supernatural message that's ever been that's right brother Brad said I never worked in any realm supernatural realm there's nothing natural about these seals because the natural seals remember the natural seals break while we're gone night tribulation if you get that heart right so that's not to us in the natural form you shall wait a minute ok let me the lab brother Graham said from revelations 412 revelations 1921 but stood whom the Jews not to us he said has nothing to do with us that's what throws people off as you why what about ten seven what about well it is we get the supernatural element of it and then we get the supernatural part i read you that quote together down i'll read it again so my the mystery a mystery of scripture and the previously hidden truth down divinely revealed that's what happened in 1963 it was divinely revealed hidden truth right here got it the wheel Miriam brown because over here will read it next Sunday I got it mark brother Brown says and questions and answers now remember questions and answers was right before he preach the seven seals you pre six seals stops had questions and answers an increase 77 gut paragraph nine I am just positive you don't see it paragraph 10 I'm supposed this is just tape for ourselves but let me say it see that you don't you don't get and you're not supposed to get all those whole six knots that he preached the most wonderful message that he have ever brought in the purest form had ever been brought in and he says you don't get it don't try and put your interpretation to it you only get further away just take my advice if you believe me as God has given me favor in your sight don't put your own interpretation to it and all of your conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and is happening and I know what it is now I'm just not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is is something that's tremendous and it's gone right now it's gone and there is not a way in the world for you to see it reading questions and answers right here I got it I got right there you don't see it but so help me with the Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told you before don't try to put any interpretation to it you don't see when they get they got the red environment I mean I was sitting there when rather Brown was preaching the wild horse rider was the Antichrist and they were having a wonderful time in and honest-to-goodness I some people got a revelation of that but they didn't get the full revelation because it was gone because there wasn't the right kind of people to get it because it's got to be total revelation all with the statute with perfect man and all these things I'm just reading what the prophet said I'm not telling you here so that's what brother Brown said they didn't get it okay but right now is the time for us to get it right that's right man guy it's that that right one button he said down on seventh seal will read it later this way on down the line a mystery in Scripture and they previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation so we have got the revelation of the seals one is Hannah Christ to the Antichrist three in the enterprise for Jenna craft in four different ages 5 is the fifth seal jus not the regular bride diet st. seal is the two prophets that we're talking about in Daniel and a seventh seal is Jesus Christ Himself are over 9y week why was killed by me wait we got to change this morning it's almost was after 10 when I went to Lamar between six and nine will give it to party tank and go home don't be i'm being funny but that's not funny we've got the divinely revealed truth but there's a supernatural element still rich remains despite the revelation that's the part you not have to get we have the divinely revealed truth right the whole lotta the property God brought brother branham took Brock from Genesis to Revelation and he opened the previously hidden mysteries in the Bible wanna look still here there's a supernatural element nine different from his revelation not different from the Bible but there's a supernatural element that is what it's got to be personal to you everybody that was sitting there in the 60s that got the divinely revealed truth probably took him back and preached his people and it helped them and it made them better Christians but that's what he said he said just continue on the way you are be a wonderful Christian but there's a supernatural element that's not going to be revealed to you because let's just be honest ninety percent them people that were sitting in that service high stone that's been 50 years ago George they were 20 there 79 if they were 30 they're 18 m young say one thing so most of the people is that he preached to that great revelation of the seals are already in glory waiting on somebody to watch catch the revelation i think that's what brother ground he caught that he caught that he said it's not for you going live good Christian life you you're going to in other words you're born again you're around were you supposed to be you're going to go into that sixth dimension but right around becoming the Lord something's going to happen there's a supernatural element that's going to come out of these seals it's going to literally change its my brother tells me preach and literally change our body we've been turned back I hope you kids when he said we've been turned back right the Omega bride is now connected with the Alpha bribe because the Alpha bride remember the Alpha Prime there was no Trinity there was no water baptism phone somehow all those things all eternal hell that wasn't in the first three ages that are the Alpha the Alpha ride it came down in was filtered through man's idea tradition through the church ages but the Holy Ghost was still there don't dis clin the Holy Ghost it was in every age but you come down to the Omega bride and the Omega bride has to be turned back by Malachi 4 right the mountain dump though Omega bride has to be turned back to the Alpha by now that doesn't mean we go back that means all the revelation from those six sir changes come up to this one okay because we still need that ox lai program said we still need that hops anointing to get us through a daily job and daily work they went to the gallows for it you and I go to work and then a hot gets this through be our daily walk so that was the Holy Ghost in every age or the type of but now there's a supernatural element coming to this age you show this is so mysterious know it's going to be what's written in this Bible and written in this prophets message we're not going to get it we don't have to go to class marking to get it anymore tell us what makes everybody so well with clams larkin that he had it first and brother drowned him didn't have it clamps larkin had a revelation right he had revelation but he went the full revelation brother Adam had the full anointing the full revelation he was a prophet glass Michael was not a prophet but listen not me but if anything was part of the fivefold ministry in there the whole job don't you think Duncan for real things to it amen he did hey if he come out of reach the wild horse rider was he and I cried he must've had a revelation because nobody else did that was totally contrary everybody's believe okay so he understand what I'm saying I'm not saying Claire's Larkin was was the man like most of them you ask what a lot of people would leaving the message for this and I'll brother branham just read clamps Larkin and then he just came over and wrote the same thing but clamps Larkin did and got got something from him well brother branham read a lot of things that he got a lot of but he had to have a personal revelation right you're not a read a lot of things but you got to have a personal revelation we got to leave all that together right and get it free self so I said I don't want brother branham's revelation I want to use his revelation for me to see something out of them yeah right I can't go take a body change with his revelation 13 I can't take a body change for both elf revelation for rubber I said this is a personal relationship with God and you gotta get it personally for yourself now if I get política man he gets not eating meat on Sunday and he gets you know he gets them they get milk you got a problem that's right in front right either one person is right another 12 wrong oryou airliner oh ok take me to rights that's him in the in the message of the hour and that's what's the problem being being man has not got the supernatural element he's got a knowledge of the truth because look like I said one more time before you can read in that book you're reading that seal book program breaks down all the seals right but you know he turns around he says you know Jesus already previously and Bob's your the scholars are like what in the world i mean the scholars thought well man this is what's been sealed up through all the ages and no i can understand it little brother branham he goes by says let's go to Matthew 24 and he brings all the skills to help all six that when he breaks them right down in the Bible and says Jesus is already priestly we just didn't get the revelation you know what he was saying we didn't get to Revelation then just like we're not getting to the river Chanel right but now okay so then you take Matthew 24 there is a divinely revealed truth brother Branham brought all them and put every steel in them in Matthew 24 right but yet nobody got a decent we said I just read it to you nobody got the true supernatural element of what was going on nobody got it right hmm that's right well if the Apostles woulda got it they have interacted back to end if they got the full revelation yesterday what I'm saying right the fullness you and I have to have the fullness and my program said beyond any man's knowledge so don't dig for for natural knowledge of them be quiet like I talk to you yes because there is a supernatural element now if it's a supernatural element it can't be given to a group it has been given to an individual you can't give yourself I mean I can't give such a journey revelations I can preach and let God open her eyes let what let the let the one of the beasts say come and see right one of the beasts they come and say I want to show you what this this made that right the man so that's what we're waiting on we've always been with everybody and honestly everybody been waiting on some great somebody to raise up progressive the great one is here that was in nineteen sixty-two degrees that the great one is here what what we looking for yes we're looking for it to run this through our filter and not be a humanized filter I've just watched right on the piece of paper mm-hmm like I said one more time the seals has been opened he showed us what ever see it was in this book and we read it I read this become any time to ready ready kept ready read read read read read more the other one out and got this one one of the old hardback sorry and help me absolutely got the supernatural element don't think something maybe we can start putting that supernatural element together okay maybe we can see see not I'm not see with our eyes see because you can see where your eyes this right you see the seal I see you book I see the pages that man has put in a book all the tape the brother branham made but am I really seeing the revelation okay that's what we've got again we've got to see the revelation or we're going to just keep on dying going by the grain and then it was team and nothing wrong with that that's why I said there's only a small portion is going to really get the supernatural level he said what does that mean that's the unwritten park you asked what the supernatural element is not written in the Bible if it was written in the Bible Satan could read it he can interpret it but he had only interpreted letters he can't get a supernatural revelation he can't get the unwritten part so program said the seven thunders not written anywhere in the Bible Diana but it's contained in the hobo the seals and help the seals is not going to come from a new book that somebody's gonna find it would be this new book give me this book made you more and more and more making you you said well what are we waiting on listen Paul said what in Thessalonians we which are allowed in our main he's already told you that somebody's not going to the revelation is right there we which are alive and remain to the guy award will not prevent or hinder those who are asleep but the trumpet of God shall sound the supernatural element because look you say what's the supernatural element alright hollow on the road to Damascus he's riding his horse all of a sudden boom he falls off his horse God is speaking straight to that man it's also why that persecutors me he said oh I'm Lord who art thou you persecuting me why are you kicking against the Kree why and they had a conversation but those men around him what the model say they heard the noise it's all the way they didn't hear the voice that's right that's why I'm brother branham when he went to Serbia canyon and stood on that rock and he threw that rock up in the air they said that came down a thunder they'd knocked all the rocks off you know Owen 33 sided rocks that they'd pick them all up there but what came down they saw the cloud they saw up heard the thunder but God was speaking straight to brother ground and said judgment will strike the west coast now they didn't hear that they saw they heard apart but they didn't get the supernatural element who was not speaking to though he went speaking to a group of people he spoke to one person when he spoke to Paul he spoke to one person a man so that's your supernatural element we we have William God the books we got to take we got this room up wonderful we carry this with us we move it around we can read it and we can sit here and we can keep looking at this blue player I got our parents their supernatural element but until we catch the revelation that we're still going to be here well I was just gonna say in regards to the supernatural revelation of it it's not even though brother brother Brennan preached the seals it's not like he went all right like an instruction manual step one you need to do this step two you need to know there's no it was just all kind of but then it has to be supernaturally gathered to try you know in a supernatural way because I mean it's like you say the devil would be able to drive it too if it was a remember when he said 10 Seventh Seal he said he said hold something in your hearts they can't get he said but once he comes out he said saito start trying for her well that's the supernatural element to me that's the supernatural element that you and I are gonna have to catch ourselves to get us out of here or to even get us toward a body change to make us where we can make it may be our or we problem out last night about you know things having a conversation about you know survival pretty much just bottom line about survival and what we're going to do I just feel that that there's nothing we can do naturally to keep the squeeze from coming nothing everything we got they can track every move we made them are you to it you say well what about them we have cash you back our twin old bill I would let me get lucky boy yeah well me too I didn't hear what I said is anybody how to play no avail let's place it Lisa hand me one there when I bill please try to make okay I got the blue minutes don't matter it's got that strip in it right there cash-strapped that strip tells them where it come from where it was made and what it is now how they know that I scan it they can scan that you should all go put this in the woods and hide under up you know you put it in you know it is waiting put it in your pocket you put in your pocket or you go hide somewhere turn the scanner on there oh we don't wear that twenty-dollar bill there thank you i'm gonna even with cash see we all thought by longtime goal if your head if you had cash that's how you get that maybe I cash it was okay huh you know what so come with it's gonna take that right there that's right to keep us to the body chain brother Brad I mean we're going to read it as we continue on come at the third pull the third pull brother Brown said it's dormant everybody's gone about the third full he said it's gone from you what the ability to make this come to pass can I can I say that and not be using my own words brother I was telling them you can't use what I'm giving you right now Yeah right you can't use it it's gone from you in other words it's been withdrawn brother ground said the third pool is now laying dormant what is the third Pole speaking the word he said but when the squeeze comes in other words will bring goes quote when the squeeze comes that's when you'll be able to use it but you gotta have it in storage before you can use it because remember i was reading the other day and Lord showed me a little bit more about the five wise and five foolish virgins we'll get into that maybe later on but if you look at the five wise virgins had the oil now what happened to the five foolish when the call came listen to me he's all efforts work hanging in when the call came behold the bridegroom coming they all woke up listen they all woke up all 10 of them woke up because the file says we're going in and the file that didn't realize they didn't have it because of the call because they were there I must have been in the same building church message hmm and by all right with that okay because the file go to the file foolish go to the five wise so they're not separate their together because the call woke them all up the prophets message won't even foods version problems mentions woken up yes but there's five to have supernatural element and this file that didn't but they didn't say well we really get know that you were to go to find it they came right here and said give us of your oil holy those give us of your revelation we got a revelation no man they had a revelation judge finds things if I back to me is there a revelation but they didn't have the supernatural element because these five went on in that's right these five state because they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had me they said they had a reading interpretation that's what I had my was 14 years old I had a reading interpretation of the message but I didn't have a supernatural element revelation cook I knew I didn't have the Holy Ghost because I proved that years later you know the one out in the world I proved that so it's got to come down to the supernatural element to finalize and five foods burdens all heard the same call it's not like this one heard a special different call and these hurt a different car Bible says word went out behold the bridegroom cometh they all can look up so they must have heard he too but remember they didn't hear what these five her right because they wanted to go and find out what these five had heard that they had heard commander think about that ye so comfy we separate them foods further than the wide no they were all together and to be in the same barren building church because when the call came everybody woke up but what happened is somebody got a supernatural element and went on in and these have to stay so they didn't have that supernatural so next time you will start on the co-branding steelbook and we'll start reading the seal and what will do is it will read the natural part of it the revelation then we'll start talking a little bit you know make us watch the listening we got a few more years anyway
