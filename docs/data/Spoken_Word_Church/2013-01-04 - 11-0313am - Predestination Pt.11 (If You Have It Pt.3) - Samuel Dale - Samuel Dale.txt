about your word and Lord help us to walk in you forgive our sins and keep our hearts and lives directed on you because no matter what comes or goes we want our desires to be centered solely upon you and the word of the hour guide us now in Jesus name amen Ephesians one we begin in verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're at now in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood to forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time now here's the the whole thing that you know bringing it down that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ now let's go over to First John 5 just one verse verse 20. and we know that the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding now if you have the new birth the Son of God Has Come to do what now to give us an understanding see and we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word what is eternal life to know him to know him is eternal life and who is he and he's the word right so then to know the word not letter not quotes you know the letters on a page that'll kill you but to know the revealed word is to know eternal life right because that's what we've been trying to to talk about we've been on predestination now for uh this is about tonight's message and uh we've been trying to get you to see a point that you know we want you to stay on and hold it that we see that predestination is what people say is a bad word but it's it's not a bad word it's our understanding of it right it's what we make it a bad word the word itself is okay but you know what's what our understanding and our understanding of predestination has always been based on not everything is really on the Bible is based upon our previous understanding right all right now if we've been taught the truth come on then you know we can can uh uh you know we can have it understand it but if we've been taught era right see there's no way ever to come in error listen to what I'm saying now you can't come in error to the truth right there's no way era can bring it to the truth right right it can't do it it can't bring you to it it takes the truth to bring the truth all right now you know to find out we're an error to get rid of it yeah that's a good point because that's what we need but error will never bring truth you have to see truth and then error automatically will unfold when you see one true and living God see then you can see that the white horse rider would have to be the Antichrist Etc or whatever because it would be something in opposition and you know in that then that's why we've stressed that the prophet says that there's not too many uh genuine new births one because the word is not taught correctly all right then when the word is not taught correctly then what are you going to get you're definitely not going to get you know genuine verse out of it it just won't work so you you know you have to uh uh try to find the truth because you shall find us and know the truth and the truth shall set you free all right but what is predestination the prophet of God said you know that predestination looks back to foreknowledge all right or it looks back to election that's the two different points that he uses all right now so that means for knowledge is first if predestination looks back to foreknowledge then that means that for knowledge was in existence before the predestination all right and it means then that what is predestinated to be is because of the foreknowledge they you know that then should be a sensible uh understanding let alone a spiritual Revelation that would just be into our hearts to see that God then would not predestinate according to his desires but he would really predestinate according to your desires amen see he would predetermine it because of your desires and your thoughts and he's the prophet said if you wanted salvation then God would have it ready for you when you got here all right see now ever and then you get into that then then you can just keep going but we spent time on that laying that Foundation to not get away from that now and then we started moving a little bit now into going back into the the you know into God and his ways and and uh as I tried to tell you for over and over and over we saw oh we were just in the mind of God well that's wonderful that's a good quote that's all right but remember Judas was in the mind of God I mean at the same time he saw uh Jesus coming on Earth Me by his for knowledge abilities he would also know that Judas this carrot would be there all right and they would both be from a thought in his mind but remember now that Jesus would be predestinated eternally and Judas would be predestinated to go to destruction all right so then God would have to have a way that he could do that and so he does it by foreknowledge you know these foreknowledge allowed him to understand got to have her brother back there with us good see we always say you're a visitor one time and two times you're just a part of us so make yourself comfortable no so then predestination is not hard if we follow it correctly we try to make it to be what we have been taught as I said all of our lives right and in doing that see then we come down to a conclusion that it is not as the prophet said the person everything in the world if if God if I always say that to us let you you're the question not me if there is a God he said well you're saying therefore is when you're down there no I'm not doubting them that's in your your point that's to you you're the one that's saying it not me all right if there is a God and he can't keep things straight and run it right then one worship him I mean let's get us a totem pole and have a good time and forget the whole thing you know yeah but if there is a God then if that God doesn't know the very beginning and the ending then what kind of a God are you serving well in a way I guess you know in a way you know that uh maybe he knows a little bit well that means you know more than he does yes no that's the reason I like talk fun you know blunt see if you think that God doesn't know everything then you think you know more than he does well see that puts you in a bad position but anyhow I mean then we get into looking at as I said about for knowledge and then how would God predetermine things to be is because he could look down and see the Bible says Jesus Christ is a lamb slain Revelation 18 13 8. then he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so then if he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world we know that wasn't a physical happening right because some 2000 years ago then there was a physical happening that Jesus Christ had to die on the cross if it was physical back dire there was no reason for him to come down here and die again so that's not real but they're in the physical that was in the mind of God so then he could look down and he could write her name down or leave her name out because of our choice that's what I said there and I've tried to make the point over and over to you see the reason people don't want to believe in foreknowledge they're afraid of it they're afraid of four knowledge they want to be some great big spiritual thing about oh I just believe you know like who was it the old guy you know stick his hand in you know Napoleon walk around and they just want to believe that all oh yeah I've resisted sister you know what does that do any good but you see then you start saying yes but now God predestinated according to what you desire all right now here's the one side then I see people don't want that because they know it's based on what they do you say now salvation brother the hell is not based on what I did I didn't say anything about that that's right that's right but what we do and don't do has got a lot to do with it but we don't go out and live like the devil don't want to die like Paul me so then what we do is is we wind up making the Bible false prophecy by taking our own conceived idea I'm saying this is what it is then we turn around we take the message of the hour that we believe that God sent us a message and then we've come to that basis and we we want to make it line up where we want it to line up to be able to see it so people's afraid of foreknowledge because you're sitting there right now thinking something all right because it's impossible for the human mind not to think right all right so you're thinking you know that God knows that thought yeah that's right and he not only knows the thought he knows why you had to talk and he's going to know the next thoughts you have about the thought right now if he doesn't he's not God all right so then what you have to do is you have to to bring it to a basis of where you say wait just a minute now God knew I was going to be saved to have everything ready for me the only thing I can do is accept it all right now me accepting him is one thing amen but him accepting us is another thing amen now him accepting us is based upon a higher level or reasoning or some you know reason for it to be done and uh then that way we want to go into that point to see that and like I said now if we just deal with being in the mind of God whether than Judas this guy it was in the mind of God that's right the at the same time Peter James Johnson and all of them was upon the Earth Judas was right there and in the mind of God he knew exactly what they would do he knew exactly what Judas would do all right see then the thing formed the scripture says can't say why did you form me this way because God never made us wrong that's right right like I'm trying to tell you all even into the Fallen condition God gave you a perfect soul I didn't say eternal a lot of difference in the word but how could God give you an imperfect Soul well it's God's fault because of my problem here now you're talking about the flesh but still it doesn't make no difference because the a baby is as perfect as it can be when it's born unless there's something wrong physically in the body so then God gives you a perfect Soul a perfect spirit and he does the best he can and that's putting the distance blank that just blank as I can make it under the condition we exist in he's done as good as he could do about bringing us into the world hmm but see then what we do after then is what salvation is based upon because if you won't accept it well if I'm predestinated I'll be there all right the predestination is whether or not you accept it because he could predetermine but now as I started saying a moment ago then according to about 154 churches book it's not the person you know but you're looking at the the people we're looking at from God it's the seed our word that's right all right now so then that cedar word can be predestinated and it will take place but see in doing that then if you believe in it that he would predestinate the word like we'd say forever Age The Prophet would say it they would be a word and God before the world predestinated it and he knew where that would be director so when Martin Luther walked out there to preach the message to the just shall live by faith that was that justification was the predestinated seed all right now Luther the flesh was predestinated by foreknowledge of what would come upon the Earth and all of his trinitary and Doctrine they had and believing I think he would neither one that said the Jews were to be taken out and killed was Martin Luther you see because he didn't understand what the that part wasn't predestinated eternally it was that word for that day but it would have to be somebody on Earth to take that word and preach that word to bring It Forward all right so then that would be the word would be predestinated eternally thank God for giving us the word that we can believe it because they're deceived forever ages you live in see then nobody can take your place but God's waiting on you and I to realize it well I've always believed presidentialize the word well how do you believe it well I believe I come into this world with eternal life that's the way some of the people of the message never believe well that's their belief that's nothing to do with me and you I'm not going to argue with them about it that's their business you can believe what you want to you can believe you're a big toes God but I always tell you don't stick it up for me to kiss it cause I'm not going to do it I might hit it with a hammer because I'm just not going to play around no all right but as far as what you believe you believe what you want to I've never tried to convince nobody of what I believe I try to preach the gospel and unless you make up your own mind all right you see then I believe before you can have eternal life that you must receive eternal life that's what I'm trying to get over Wednesday that night there you know and and everything and I've had these notes so you forgive me when we get over at a while and you got x's on them because I've had these notes for a while and then Joe's having a joke on them backers and forth for them to be able to get them on the internet but still what I want you to think about today is did you come with eternal life that's the way some people believe wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if it was true but I don't believe it would that be a wonderful situation you think about it you wouldn't have to worry about a thing that's right you just live like you wanted to and then you're going to help me anyway because we're eternal because I don't believe it I believe you must be born again that's right I believe you must receive eternal life as the prophet of God said even your little Virgin Mary that you call the mother of God said she had to go to the upper room to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I believe that anybody would have had any right to us to have hollered and screamed about eternity it was probably her that's right because she was a carrier of almighty God but a carrier didn't make her to the bases that she had eternal life she still had to receive it right that's right all right now somebody tell you you don't have to receive eternal life you just tell them say well I'm sorry I don't believe you cut away that's right ain't no need to argue with because you ain't gonna do no good because they got quotes Let's see we had quotes from raising the Baptists because I could quote to you and prove to you that there was one God when I was in the Baptist Church because the Baptist Doctrine is one God but then the way we explained it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity coincarnal till then you can see we really didn't have it right we just had words you know words will kill you all right but you say but I came to the world with eternal life let's read some of those things if your Prophet had to say about it and I don't mind reading them when he said something you know I love to read it because I believe it'll all come together and do it now I've been trying to get these notes done for three sermons now so all right you know and uh so you just forgive it you that are visitors you you try to bear with us because you know if I do it in another sermon I'm going to be waiting four sermons to be able to say what I'm trying to say so I'm going to just go ahead and try to do it and then if you don't understand me you talk to me I have a service about it because I believe that you must have you must receive eternal life right that's right now we'll get to it in a minute so we'll we'll run around and said we always was eternal all right that's a direct quote Jesus told the people said you know the disciples said search the scriptures that's it right there instead of in them you think right you have eternal life right amen now that's what Jesus said yeah and I believe that's what brother Bradford was saying search the rest of the message you think you have eternal life you know what as far as God was concerned if we believe that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain according to revelation 13 8. if we believe that then in God's mind as far as God was concerned then anyone that would ever receive eternal life in his mind they had it then is that true Amen in his mind right but remember now his mind would be dealing with looking down through and coming back to his foreknowledge that's right and that's how he would predetermine and I've always told you see people say I if I just thought I don't want to be a thought in God's mind I'm just as honest as I can be I want to be a part of the one that done the thinking because that way of giving me eternal life if I'm a thought of in God's mind you can see me that I'd be dying going to hell so I don't want to be a thought in God's mind he said well that's just a carna we're putting it well it may be but that's the way I believe it I want to be a part of the very one that done the thinking then I don't have to worry about it right right I've got everything under control you know as long as if he's in command no but you see as far as God is concerned because I said every person that would ever receive eternal life before the world he could he would believe that they had eternal life now here's our point that we've been trying to get I gave you a few quotes back on it to show you you can go down through there and read them as you as I'm talking we talk about eternal life what is your thoughts of eternal life like I said we take it and we say and read Around used it and it's a good illustration that eternity's like a circle which means it has no beginning and no end well in mathematicians you would know what I'm saying take the circle and Tool it like this and what have you got you see my hands turn one's going one way one's going the other grab the sides of the of the thing and twist it you've got the Signet or sign of what they call the infinite which is really not a circle right like this it goes up and down and back around and up and down and back around that's the Signet of what you call Infinity all right but the point is good and wonderful about no beginning and no ending but I tried to get you to see a point and I keep making it over and over it's easy for us to look at eternity is going that way and I believe it and I believe after this world is over with I believe we're going to preached to you for 40 years about it that we're just getting enough understanding here by the new birth and all of our great mentality we have we're just getting enough ability to be able to comprehend when we Step Beyond the curtain's time do whatever you want to call your happy hunting ground or whatever you want to call it or Heaven we're just getting enough the prophet said we get a message of tear down to the endless ages now how can you take an eternal word which would mean that word never had a beginning and it can never have an ending how can you comprehend that with the human mind but it said we make it a circle but my point is we can go that way looking at eternity and talk about a great time of coming to a position in eternity and that's wonderful but now if we believe that eternity had no beginning and no ending we ought to be able to go just as far that away going to be able to look back through time until time becomes non-existent and we can step back into the great eternities just as far that away as we can go that way amen all right now the prophet would say in the beginning before the eternal Now where's the human mind can comprehend that right that's right we might as well forget it you can't comprehend what he's saying he's just simply explaining eternity right all right so now there's no beginning there's no ending all right that's why we don't believe in an eternal sonship see because the sun has a beginning that body that Jesus we call Jesus dwelling upon the Earth two thousand years ago that body had a beginning and that body had to be one day made Eternal right in the resurrection Ascension Etc all right you see it went from a time element to Eternal position all right and I don't understand why we can't see that our soul come into the world lost and doomed and on the way to hell born in sin shaping in an English past my mother's womb go forth a liar according to the psalmist David right and that's why I don't I don't understand if Jesus had to go through to that to be able to hit body be made eternal yeah I don't see why we can't comprehend that his body could receive eternal life why is it we can't understand that our moral part of us which is all of us Body Spirit and soul why we can't receive eternal life you know one day the body you're looking at here will be made Eternal we don't believe in getting a new body that's an old denominational Doctrine right Jesus raised with nail prints in his hand showing that that won't work now you don't need to arguing with nobody he just raised when they'll press in his hand right but yeah we've been taught by Mom and Daddy uncle and Sudi and and all down through time that we're gonna get us a new body you know what they're doing still doing the message now they're still preaching we're gonna get a new body we're going to walk out one of these days on our own ashes in the Millennium then we're going to walk around in some kind of a form or something and then we're going to walk back and at some way that's going to come come back or something I listened to him I couldn't understand it but that's their business we we're here right but do you see that eternal life has no beginning right and we don't believe in Eternal sonship see that's why I said the the denomination teaching uh you know God is three persons Blessed Trinity co-worko eternal now how could see that Doctrine they believe each one of the three and then they'll say oh no it's not three it's just one but yet they make three personalities and they make them co-equal and co-eternal yeah yeah well if if words is words co-equal means co-equal go equal means identical same substance so what kind of a theory have you got but see we believe in God being made manifest the Eternal God condescending from Glory down to where we are and in doing that he took upon himself human flesh he could dwell here as melchized he could dwell into the Old Testament at the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant all that was wonderful but one day he stepped in the flesh to show us what we had to do that he had eternal life because he was God he didn't become God as they're saying now on the River Jordan that's they're Doctrine did he become god well no you got a problem he he was God Almighty or you got a trinitarian concept you got to do this more than anything else but that's that's other people's business I try to preach the gospel I believe almighty God came down in human flesh to fulfill the Bible and then him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he said I come from God I go to God he said if you've seen me you've seen the father all right all of that to show who he was show us the father they said Jesus said have I been so long waiting you didn't see me if you see me you saved the father right but they couldn't comprehend that but if he had to come into the world and then had to receive eternal life into that body why can't we see that we come into the world lost and his purpose for dying was to save us to where he couldn't part eternal life to you and I yes but I just believe Brother David I just believe what the prophet said when you're going to believe I almost said all right if eternity never begins and Eternity can never end so then Eternal sonship goes out but now we do believe in eternal godship sir amen all right so you believe in the Eternal godship that means God can come down and live with us the great Eternal can live right here with us and we can handle him as the Bible says all right but you know one day the Bible says we'll be lacking because you know we we will because we'll be like him right in other words we're going to keep advancing forward we receive eternal life by the new birth that doesn't make our body and spirit eternal neither did the eternal life dwelling in him make his body eternal he had to live for those 33 years as a human being in the outward realm amen right but then one day that body stepped into eternal life right we just keep walking in the word and one day we'll step into eternal life that's Body Spirit and soul man all right so your denomination said we got to get a new body because they don't believe God can can redeem this and if he can make it I don't think he got no problem about redeeming it yeah but now Brother David he made me like it no he didn't make you like that he did not make you the way we You Were Me The Way We Are we volunteered for it when we become of age of accountability he paid the price we didn't have to do it we put ourselves in the pawn shop of life right we blame God for doing it or at least try to blame the devil for doing it ain't gonna blame you need one we've done it ourselves we put ourselves into the world of lost condition God was right there when we reached that age of accountability that's what accountability is accountability is the the ability to give an account is that what accountability is in other words you reach to a place that you're responsible we'll see if we hit right at that point had we realized we're responsible for what we're doing and we stopped right there and said God save me that's right but what would have happened right but we didn't do it did we know all right so think about what he's saying look down at number four you know it's because I don't want to read these notes as much if these have been before you before but look at the one down where it says E6 of have not I sent D 1962 uh 124. eternity never begins never ends see never had a beginning this is our brother back there I have a copy somebody to make sure he's got a copy of how do we believe right around him was a prophet and we believe that you know I don't know who you are and how you believe but we believe that God sent a prophet in the last days and I sure like to read about what he said we don't believe that Prophet to be God no don't believe nothing about it being God but God used the man to bring a message and if you're a Baptist then God used John Smith to bring you a message if you're a Methodist do you use your I mean yeah you use John Wesley to bring you a message if you're a Lutheran the youth Martin Luther to bring your message so whatever Church you're from you got somebody back there that was doing it and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ all right that's right do you say I'm not gonna follow no man who are you following you walk around and look and you'll find out you call me her a certain way you walk a certain ways because somebody ahead of you you liked it that way right my brother-in-law got his arm blowed off years ago right in here and he would you know he didn't have a hand to clap with so if you've done anything he doesn't know if you know and he hit his hand well you know his little grandson you know that little grandson he didn't clap like this thank you because that's what he's saying so just remember that all right now look what he said he turned it he never begins never ends see never had a beginning never had an ending you can't explain it but anything that had a beginning has an end now watch so you say What About Us brother Branham well as long as your natural human off the Earth here you had a beginning now everybody knows because if I'm standing up here today and I said well I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm gonna pull a hat I'm gonna I'm gonna pick a day in the year and I'm gonna pull a number out of that hat and I'm gonna give the one that says they were born on that day I'm gonna give them a hundred dollar bill well if I pulled your pulled out to your birthday you jump up and run up here wouldn't you do you understand what I'm saying you realize you you know your body wasn't eternal right right it's not now if he did but I'll tell you what I'd hate to stay here like this if this is heaven Forgive Me Lord you know yes because I'm a human see as long as you're a natural human of the earth you had a beginning but if you're born to heaven you're part of God and that Spirit never had a beginning because it's part of God it's Eternal that's the only way you can ever live forever is to have eternal life that's right and eternal life but anything that has begins has an end all right now if anything happened beginning if you can't go with your understanding of predestination or existences or whatever but if you can't go all the way back and tie that and be just as Eternal as God is then you've missed it now here's our concept that we've had and it's all right Jesus was God manifested in flesh called a son right right he called a son now that word that come out of God in the beginning the logos is called a son of God that's why the trinitariancy believe in it's a Eternal sonship when there's no such thing as Eternal censorship there's Eternal God but not eternal sonship all right now do you believe the new birth makes you a son of God okay now how do you believe that if he was the son of God and had no beginning he was only just called a son to eternal life doesn't make you a son of God it makes you eternal God now you're going too far brother Dale no we just think never went far enough yet we're not getting it you explain it to me the new birth May son Oh you mean you won't admit that that's what it is you will say it from your lips and make many Eternal son or daughter how could it make you an eternal son or daughter it can make you God manifest right in another form called son that's what he was he was God manifested in a form called a son amen we are his offspring yes sir we're his children right what do we believe so if you're born of heaven and that's what Jesus said to to Nicodemus when he said you must be born again you go back to the original translation you'll find that says You must be born from above in other words Jesus was saying to Nicodemus you've got to be born from where I come from if you're not going from where I come from you don't have a new birth that was what he was saying he said you got to be born from the same place I came from where did he come from heaven so he must have a Heavenly bird all right no you keep those and stay with it now let's just get over here and read a little bit look at number nine on your notes this is the one everybody likes to use okay and I believe exactly what he's saying future home page 34 1964 802. there's your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal thing it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day this you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved amen and Jesus came to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with that sounds really what really shadow of that couldn't we yeah boy we don't have to worry about nothing do we like I said while ago we just feel like the devil and don't worry about it we always was eternal but what did Jesus Christ have to die for yes did he die to bring you an I'll ask you a simple question I left questions you know what they make you think see if it's like what most people think that we always was eternal then Jesus must have come into the world and done all he done and died to just let us know we always was eternal well what didn't why did he not tell that to Nicodemus and then go right on back up to heaven and not have to pay the price you sure put him through a whole lot by your thinking that I just come in the world eternal life that's what my pastor preaches well I'd find me another Pastor because that's what the prophet of God said he said you stay with your pastor as long as he stays the truth said he gets off the truth lead the pastor to find you another pastor and stays with the truth I stopped trying to brush churches or doing nothing I tell them what the prophet had to say about it I don't want you here if God don't send you because you've been hinterest to me and I'd be a hinders to you hey that's what I told my son-in-law when he was dating my daughter I said I want you to lose because you you're just moving there I said I want you there because of the word uh that's just I'm sorry that's just the way I am but while you're looking at that one see that's in the message future home let's go over to number 17 on your notes get on over that's why I like to read all the prophets had to say like the prophet of God said one day he said I can show you one scripture said Judas went and hung yourself and give you another scripture that says you go do likewise now I told you two scriptures go hang yourself huh but that's not what the scripture says that's taking it out of text that's not saying what God Said you're making it say what you wanted to say look what he said here out of the same message that was page 34 that we just read now here on page 37 in the same message he says now you say well look at this priest wasn't he a son of God he proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what now you know he's talking about the priests they they made in Belgium did he say I believe the Bible was sure he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that's been back before him and it's the same thing today see I know that's strong but it's the truth that was the word as spoken exactly for what day and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not have representation of predestination she only had the predestination he see only the predestinated will only be the one that does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be a part of God all the time because he's the only one that's eternal now them little words right there there's a question there we got in the message of one time it looks like we just all Eternal everything's Eternal we come in the world eternal life we don't have to worry about nothing don't have to be saved don't have to do a thing no we're just eternal but then he asked the question or makes a statement that's really not a question if you have eternal life you were a part of God in the beginning now he's definitely not talking about her body is he that's right he's definitely not talking about our spirit and our soul of our natural human mortal or mortality immortal you're not talking about that but being a part of God as I said when Jesus spoke to the disciples one day he said it's I and you that's easy to understand isn't it he come down give his own life come live in us but read the rest of that sentence you and me I and you you and me it's easy to understand that we received a new birth he can we talk about as I said eternal life if you've got eternal life today the eternal life you have always was eternal not you man and it didn't make you eternal until you received it well that's that's making the beginning no it's not that ain't making it a beginning that's making exactly what it is if you have eternal life that eternal life that you have never had a beginning right you know you go along through life and a lot of people you know you more than the family and one day comes on somebody comes along to you and say hey you realize you wouldn't Dale and you realize they adopted you you said who am I so everybody start searching I haven't told you my concept on that of course my concept don't Mount the yellow beans but it is mine my concept is if I've been a Dale now for 70 years and somebody come along tell me that I'm not no Dale I was a McGillicuddy well I'm not going to go change my name to McGillicuddy now here's what's going to break your heart because you're to say I don't mean it but if I could find out I was a McGillicuddy and that made me heir to the throne of England I would never change my name to McGillicuddy because I'd be a hypocrite so you don't believe that away you think Money Changes thing now I've had the opportunity for money to change this man it ain't changed him yet I could be a multi-millionaire from what comes in this church but it don't go to my pocket that's just flat but you understand what I mean you mean my family would take me and they would raise me and feed me and then one day I found out that I wouldn't a Dale I want to know who my daddy is I know who my daddy is my daddy's once took care of me and fed me man that's just brother Dale's concept but that's I like it that way you see you say yeah you know you're giving the money and he changed well you go do what you want to see I'm a child of God and there ain't enough money in the world to talk me out of being a child of God giving the whole world the Bible said and I ain't gonna lose my soul and take it the devil offered to you so you didn't you're not as trapped if you're sitting in that you understand what I'm saying yes but I want to know who my daddy is why well I just never did feel like I was part of this family yeah cause you didn't like it cause you got a weapon your daddy raised you right you didn't like it that's blood takes one thing about it I never knew my doc my daddy in this world because I was four years old when he passed away but my mother but she could whip you good and you remembered all of them but you know when I got to be about 25 years old I thanked her all right you know why because she said something in me that's kept me all of my life she said Son you look get in jail I'll come and look through the bars at you I knew she would none of you she's getting out because it was still her ways I told you about it I seen her take them the wooden ring off of a I mean a metal ring off of a wooden barrel in there about that much real heavy metal take it and pull it off of a barrel and hit my brother with it you call that child abuse he was 18 years old he said I'm leaving home she said you're not leaving mad go in the house until you calm down then you can leave he said I'm leaving she said you're not and she pulled it up you know why he never left home you see that's child abuse take it what you want to but he stayed there you know what he realized this mama loved him absolutely you children don't want to be corrected and things I hope you have enough time to live up we sit at the house one day and the boys retired I said boys you remember when I used to tell you that it hurt me anymore with y'all than it did for you to get the whipping and I said yep I said now you've got kids of your own you know what I'm talking about don't you they said yep all they had to do some whipping all right we'll get off of that trying to make a point but listen then I gave you all of these as I've been wanting to read and you take them home and you read them I hope you have I reprinted them to where you could do it and we won't go through it we'll just give the tape you want us give it for the tape but look how many times what your Prophet had to say 32 things that are to be 1965 1205. if you got eternal life then it always was eternal if you got it if you've got eternal life that's the title of the sermon if you got it that's not a question that's a statement if you have it um Revelation chapter 5 part 2 61 6 18. and you can't have eternal life unless you're saved you've got eternal life do you cannot burn in hell for Eternal you'll be punished for your sins with your natural life but you cannot have eternal life in hell if you've got eternal life then you cannot burn forever because there's only one form of eternal life identification 1964 to 18 or 216. talking about all of the Zoe and he says if you've got eternal life and if that's God for you was in his thoughts on the eternal first we would see Jesus 1964 304. now if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and has no ending so if you have eternal life you are an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him sure as we would see Jesus 1964-18. if you got eternal life read all of these because they're underlined voice of the sign 64s 321 if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life we just read that one from future home God rich in Mercy 1965 with 0 19. 019. if you've got eternal life if we have eternal life then we always was because there's one form of eternal life we always were excuse me I'll use words and the reason we were because we are a part of God and he's the only one that's eternal except because they're repeats when their eyes were open 64 312 if you got eternal life you always was what read the rest of these I'm just doing it for the type situation people out there where they can do it proving his word eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life you were his attribute who is this male chedded at 65 221 the evening and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but to shape and form that the infinite God me all right thinking man's filter 65 8 22. but when you're born to the spirit of God then you've got you are a son of God and you always was the son of God and you always will be a Son of God there's no way to separate it because it's you have eternal life and the Eternal never had no beginning take them home and read them now that's just a handful that's nothing comparative running down your computer always was in our eternal life and just run run all day and look at it so not trying to preach to you the prophet is saying to you and I if we have eternal life the eternal life we have right now we hadn't got to this point but we will but he said the Bible says that his seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin yet the prophet says we sin every day you know what's he saying Paul was the one that we're talking about for the sins plural was he contrary to John that would say his seeds remaineth in this and we cannot sin then you've got a problem but if you're looking at it to see that that's mortal human beings are doing wrong every day yes because we're mortal human beings we have problems but that seed that that new birth which is a birth of that seed which is a birth of the word huh that always was eternal as I was saying even the other day then one day the foolish virgins right Matthew 25 where they got to five wise and five foolish one day those foolish virgins will be given eternal life you agree well you know what they're done lived their life out in this world they've done diet they've done went beyond the curtain of time into what situation they could exist in and maybe you've been there for thousands of years and they're not eternal they'll be taken up and brought before the Watcher on judgment and given eternal life you know what that day they can raise their hands and see I always was eternal run because the eternal life they have never had a beginning it never had an ending and God's thoughts about them was always eternal yeah so the day you get the new birth raise your hand and Shout Gloria Hallelujah I have eternal life always was what the eternal life so that's the only way we could be in Jesus Christ if we wasn't in Jesus Christ when he walked the shores of Galilee then where did we come from where did eternal life you have come from it was in him see then before the world ever begun God knew whether or not we would want eternal life he had it ready for us and his thoughts about us has always been eternal right what is eternal life remember my definition of what it goes just as far right away but if you can't go just as far that away you say yeah but now I can comprehend back so far and here's where you got your blockage at you need to try it you need a uh you need to get that huh blockage out of your hand you see yeah but if I go all the way back I'm going to wind up being God I'm glad you thought of that because that's what I'm appreaching right that's the only way to have eternal life is what to be a part of God amen amen that ain't talking about this body spirit and soul as you're looking at that's right that's right you're talking about eternal life that God gave me 1969. he gave me eternal life that made me a part of God right an offspring of God a child of God called a son then we're called the children of God we're called Sons and Daughters that's wonderful but just remember that a son of God is God in another form that's right thank you Lord or else you got a second person involved somewhere right right we're not a second person we're either God made manifest in human flesh upon the earth called the children of God are we a second person what do you think about eternal life throw the prophets right we always was eternal you wasn't saved on no certain day God before the world it's all you saved and wrote your name down in the Book of Life that's where we'll get back to it when we get time I'm gonna go and redeem this evening because we want to go on to that word next but we'll eventually get back to where we can go back there and see how the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for joy in eternity my brother Dale I was born with a seed in me where was it at and when was it prepared what do you mean when did they put that foot down when I was born I wouldn't want your Prophet said you know Gordon he said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world wow that's right that's a lot different than saying when it would come into the world he said it was put there before the foundation of the world what in God's mind as a part of God amen see the Plan of Redemption is simple if we get it in correct order that's human Mortals can receive eternal life that's only in your soul your body and spirit is not eternal I don't care how much you think it is how can it be that's what's keeping us from stepping into eternity right is the spirit in the body right those virtues have to come forth from the soul out through the spirit and bringing the spirit under control then the body will walk bear him right amen what is eternal life right and no beginning had no ending right see as far as I see God going that way and talking to me that's eternity but then I look back down through there and see that he said he had fellowship with us before the world that's what he told him to disciple that makes pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of the seed or eternal life I just don't believe in pre-existence of mankind like Mormon doctrines of Soul Etc I don't believe in it I mean I believe we come into the world law doomed and on our way to hell and deserving every bit of it God came down and paid a price come on come on pay the price and all I got to do is accept it part is not pardon until received is one but if I'll accept it then I can have eternal life but see that's what I said though we're afraid of foreknowledge because see that puts it on the basis of what we do and don't do it see then you'll come up in your mind when you ain't worth it salvation I don't know what we do or don't do it you tell me it's not on you tell me you don't have to receive eternal life and I'll tell you you're in the delusion to the devil I'll tell you about Jesus don't Nicodemus you know the law you know all about it they claim they knew him so well they could take a scroll hold it up stick a pin through there and tell you every letter it went through because it read them so many times but when that the greatest because Jesus called and said go back to your original and read it he said no our deep teacher D teacher meant he was the highest greatest ranking of all the teachers of Israel he said you must be born again Nicodemus and he said how can I do that he said I can't talk to you about these things ain't gonna leave me talking to you about anything else you see if we don't get born again they don't need to talk about anything anyway my brother now I'll have you to know I've been born again I'm tired of you bringing it up maybe that I'm not well you know what that proves you're not safe because your attitude toward what I said proves you're not saying if you get offended from me saying you need to be born again you're not born again is that simple enough I've offended people saying it that way run them off but I'm sorry that's the truth whether it be me you're an idiot right if I get mad at you because you tell me the truth there's something wrong with me we need to be born again in the morning again because nobody no man can call Jesus a Christ except what by the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's stand together what do we go through 539 is final book 539 anybody have a need always was yeah if you have Daddy eternal life you have always was eternal possession of looking down watching that Apostle Paul he not fall off that horse and down onto the ground yeah every from old new bird Knock You Down in fact it was made Chef Jesus Christ is his savior what you know in the Bible the message is ours how long have you been in it we must be born again and foreknowledge is still involved let's run around and said your gifts are predestinated eternally cloudful Ministries predestinated eternally just wanted to tell who was it Jeremiah one of them back I knew you before the world and ordained you into they didn't make Jeremiah before the world that made that guilt foreign concerned about him and we don't really enjoy watch my dad do to me salvation Ally pray and Believe on it father you know our sister you knew her before the world knew that the nature and ways you'd be and all we're doing here today is just standing here fulfilling what you saw before the world and we can just look back there and see Lord that you saved US dollar true but it's got to be transmitted down unto us come to a place that we can realize and hear upon this Earth and then it's not just a knowledge in our mind because that's all you would have done with Nicodemus you told him you already got knowledge he must be born or Jesus our sister said she needs it and you we ask you to just come to make her a candidate for you for you and just fill her with our holy spirit because we believe you thank you just commit everything to you now so you with our sister about what she has to do we can do it but we want to believe you you father is accepting what you've done believe and say thank you Lord you say one of that or else it can be Gloria Hallelujah reality you do it the reality that yourself thank you for the University now that you'd go with us as we just meet us and go eat a natural meal and come back your scene and with us to understand help us to see that we truly must receive eternal life but then once we receive that eternal life then that eternal life existence and goes just as far one way as it goes another it doesn't have a beginning it doesn't have an ending there was never a time that eternity could begin because it did it would it would have a time to end Lord and it can't do it eternity is eternity that's just all the words we can use we can make examples and thoughts but still is one thing for sure there's only one eternal and that's God's own life the only way we can have eternal life is to die out to ourselves and accept you as our savior and then we have eternal life and we wouldn't save them no certain day no we wouldn't we say before the world but it was transmitted down to a time that we accept to hear upon Earth we love you thank you and father and just have your way bless each one knowing they're finishing up with Brother Dean and their things are just blessed to be with him be with all the others that are not here today I wouldn't just let your manifestation be with each one of us we love you and we thank you and Jesus is your name you're dismissed if we're never again all this Earth my precious friends me a meaning ful there was a Rapture some sweetness dear my loved ones let me say sir he will come again and catch and catch right go and greet him and I'll see you see in the Rapture so ciety forever and I'll see I'll sing in the rapture
