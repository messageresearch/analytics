everybody had a big time I hope yesterday at the the yard sale they said he didn't make a lot of money but I guess they got a lot of talking done so that could be a lot fellowshipping okay Revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw now remember the testimony of Jesus Christ remember that as we're in dealing with the fifth seal that they have their own testimony that's corre of staying with the word but not the testimony of Jesus Christ right blessed is he that reth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written byin for the time is at hand amen right all right Revelations 69- 11 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw on the altar The Souls of them which were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held see not the testimony of Jesus Christ testimony they hell and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their bre Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I was trying to bring out a point our Wednesday night and the Lord begin to open up some more to me you know of what I was talking on and I just pray that the Lord would help me to be able to express what he's revealing to us amen now we know that the Bible is the complete Plan of Redemption amen that's right all right and so we read here that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen all right so then the the book itself being the Plan of Redemption and the revelation of Jesus Christ see then we are studying The Plan of Redemption amen now the Plan of Redemption right and remember now what we tried to express and all and this is what I I'll get back to in a little while and I just want to lay it down and then back up and do like I do a lot of times to make you to think that we have put a lot of emphasis upon the uh Redemption and we've dealt with it in a lot of ways as to Bringing out and we we've dealt with it as the uh The Plan of Redemption for salvation you know for the for the Bride of Jesus Christ we've dealt with Israel salvation in the Old Testament because they had one they had the bosom of Abraham the place to go that uh you know was related to the faith of Abraham and and they come when Jesus Christ came he come and paid the price right and would be able then to open up the uh Old Testament Saints you know bring them up with him yeah in the resurrection and things and uh go into the City and uh you know I don't claim to understand all of the things of redemption but I just want us to follow Redemption so then israels had their Redemptive plan as far as the Old Testament people they were not left out then the Gentile Bride Comes In which means Nations means anybody can come in right and a lot of the Jews came in to because it began basically on the day of Pentecost with Jews you know in the upper room and all and then it come turned into the Gentiles go Gentile just means Nations all right then we know that we've de we've dealt with and studied about even the foolish virgins and their Plan of Redemption and you know how that they will be given eternal life at the right Throne judgment all right and we've dealt for quite a while with the 144,000 to see their Redemptive plan and to see you know that they have a position a place and knowing where they're going to when they leave from here and you know that they will actually be in the millennial rain as Unix to the bride so we' we've tried to cover those things in doing it but we haven't spent much time on the uh fifth seal Jew and their Redemptive plan all right and I begin to see that open up more Wednesday than than I ever have you know and to to try to express it and to see what we need to understand because the I'll say this part of it and W can pick it up and bring it on into the U sixfold purpose one day maybe because see the fifth seal Jew must be also brought under that's correct the uh sixfold purpose that's right amen it's not just dealing with and I'll show you in a minute where the Prophet is reading it and I never noticed it even to be in the uh the Gabriel's instructions of what he was dealing with go we've always just basically made that um you know as to be the 144,000 right but it's not it goes into the Redemption of Israel of the fifth seal which is to be that group of people that was from Calvary down through and coming out into the end time you know when we go up then that Plan of Redemption will stop for them y right because then God will start dealing with the 144,000 all right now it might be surprisingly when we get through maybe some of it to to be able to try to express it but I'm just saying that we've we've dealt with those things but we haven't dealt with the uh part of the fifth seal Jew and that's what we're trying to do now is to see their Redemptive plan and you remember the statements that I've made that the the first four seals shows what this the the seals are not to the bride because they're after we leave out of here I hope that's beginning to click in your mind to to settle it we get the revelation of those things that's right amen all right we see where that that seal will go all the way back to Genesis and come all the way through the Bible but not be fulfilled until the time comes up because you remember how we were bringing out about the the fifth seal Jew the fifth seal Jew is actually uh her ceiling her bringing her forth her her being killed is during the church ages right amen but the prophet will say this is not during the church ages right he said because the the the ages is over with the brid are gone right but yet he's not saying that those fifth seal Jews are not placed in their position corre to be the souls under the altar yep all right and as it is then those Souls under the altar can cry how long but then it says white robes were given unto them all right now I believe that's where we're missing some of the part so we'll get back to it in a little while to to to get a little better understanding but let's just keep our thought going the way we're going right through who this group of people is and by looking at them you'd say well what has that got to do with us it's because we see the Plan of Redemption right right all right we see how they're redeemed we can see how we're redeemed we see how we're redeemed we can see how they're redeemed everything that's why the Bible made an outstanding statement there it says Jesus Christ died once for all it didn't say he died and then he has to come back again and die again and and this out of the other it said he died once all right in him is the complete Plan of Redemption right amen right whether it be the Old Testament Saints they're dependent upon who he was all right you know because of Salvation is dependent upon Jesus Christ amen the bride is dependent her salvation is dependent upon Jesus Christ all right now then the the foolish virgin is dependent you know Upon Jesus Christ and then the 144,000 is dependent upon Jesus Christ all right so the fal Jew her her Plan of Redemption is dependent upon Jesus Christ it is not some other halfhazard form or whatever just something happened along the way that uh would give them salvation no matter whether they believed it or not it is dependent upon that right in the Old Testament they did not know about Jesus Christ right but their salvation is dependent upon whether or not he was that God that the word has spoke of that's right now surely they believed in the God and they believed in their Redemptive plan is being evolving around that God but they killed that God when he came see because they couldn't understand all right then truly if we look at it all salvation is based upon Jesus Christ yes amen so now if you hear me coming through the message in a little bit and it looks like I'm leaning over a little just just remember I'm not leaning I'm trying to explain but not lean but stay with the word amen all right see then that way we can understand the Plan of Redemption right because all Redemption is related together right no matter that's what I'm trying to get to point to you no matter where it would be an Old Testament say the bride the foolish virgins the 144,000 the fal Jew or whatever it's based upon and got to have a Plan of Redemption to where we can see it and then to see how that they so Lac together right until we talk about the fifth FAL Jew one day be given eternal life all right not because they want it right but because God said it right trying to get to to to you and I like the prophet said the word is what is right right all right and if whatever God says we can't argue with it of course we do because of the carnalities of our mind but yet who are we if the prophet said it in the Bible said it then where do we have any right to think or say anything else that's right right right because see that would make us the prophet right that would make us the one to bring the message all right you see church that's not that way all right now so remember now we get the revelation of the Plan of Redemption right that goes all the way back to Genesis even really goes back up into heaven cuz Christ Min God reveal is a great message for the prophet he said let's go back in the back part of God's mind so he went all the way back up into heaven and brought it down to where we're at see then we can stand here still in Mortal bodies dying decaying you know rotting away getting older and yet be able to look back into eternity and see what was there by way of the Prophet right and then be able to look for forward all the way into eternity the future home and the thing and that's still standing here right amen that ought to make us the most happiest people in the world if it's not even revealed if it's just the fact that we can say it that's right it order to make us the happiest people in the world to be able to understand the Bible That's Right amen and what it's saying right sir right the word of this the most beautiful thing that could ever be and once it's put into place there's no problem but yet until it's revealed to us we argue it that's right because we don't understand it see there's no writings check your your thing there's no writings about this fifth seal Jew right you know now I'm sure people spoke of it and all but I mean you got writings of about all the other things of the Redemption but yet you have no one being able to speak on these things but I hope in a minute that you'll see what I was trying to bring Wednesday that you know the Apostle Paul wants it unveil from his eyes and remember now he said he saw things that he was not able to talk about right but where would he get get there's such a statement to make that we'll get to in a minute where he would be standing there persecuted and everything by the Jews and you know the Israelites as we call them but yet he would make a outstanding statement he said all Israel shall be saved now where did he get that man emphasize a statement brother B made and let you think on this idea and then you'll see that the seals are broke to the bride of Christ right brother BR said one day he said that one of the seals opened up and John saw his name right and he said have you seen your name in the book that's right by the opening of the seals as the seals revealed Jesus Christ to you right have they revealed The Plan of Redemption to you right come on would there be any problem to even think and say that God allowed Paul for that to just open up right to him in his day and him look right down and see this fifth sealed Jew and see Israel saved as a nation right right right yep then you'll understand what I was getting at those two witnesses those Jews 144,000 see the Plan of Redemption and see they've missed it but see the sunship that is that is for the bride of Christ the beautiful thing they turn down but yet see that God has finished their transgression right and made an end to their sin that's right and brought them into a place they're not going to be mad because that they servants to the bride they will rejoice amen amen but just think when that opens to them they see this fifth seal youw that God has given Redemption to their people y not just them no that's right but he's given it to Israel right not every Israelite we'll get in a minute just read it where the Prophet will say it right all Israel is not Israel right man all Jews Better Way saying are not Israel that's right all Israel is Israel when you really get down to the word Israel but think on that point and you'll see what I'm driving at that I'm trying to get us to see the Plan of Redemption for ourselves how much could it be a greater message of Grace when we would realize and say grace is unmerited favor amen an unmar favor to Israel we see it even though they crucified him and said let his blood be on us you said now wait a minute it wasn't that group of people outside that that day with Jesus I'm glad you thought of that because if you going to take that route then I'll take a route with you I didn't have anything to do with Even Adam in the garden so I'm sinless uhoh you got caught out in the open didn't you right we know that Adam and Eve in the garden represented us us and made us into the point of being lost amen and no hopes whatsoever we didn't have to be back gued for that to be that way so is it with Israel those people as I said they were even so blinded until in that group standing there was probably some of the people that finally gave their lives and would be this fifth sealed Jew was standing there that was crying out let his blood be on us right CU they were blinded right right that's where we try to make little things to fit our personal thoughts or ideas of the Bible but then it won't line up after you try to bring it down through the correct way cuz I hope you understand what I'm saying yes I try to take something like that to prove a point do you say no no it wasn't that group of people people well I don't have to be blamed for what what he's done in the garden then so you're denying the word of God trying to make some point of her own for a thought right sit back and listen and try to understand because we're going to get out of here when this Plan of Redemption is completed to you and I then we'll see as we'll read in the scripture then out of Zion the Bible speaks of the a deliverer coming to Zion all right that's the bride it comes from B gar over to the Jews over to the Gentiles that'll come from out of Zion right amen then we know that Zion represents the bride and see then the Bible says out of Zion will come a deliverer we'll read in a minute who far for Israel right this message is going to Israel to deliver them after we get out of here so we have a great key point to to be dealing with cuz without us they cannot be made perfect amen we put that to this other things but why not put it on to the rest as I said if we don't fight this battle of Armageddon spiritually speaking and win the battle over Satan and the mind there won't be no literal battle of Armageddon right there won't be no time of anything like that because he would defeat us if he defeats us right then he's defeated God himself right righten right think on these things that's right but think about it now look even these even now watch light had not shined on these scriptures that's what I'm trying to get you to see right you know understand light in other words it was written but light had not shined that's right the prophet when he saw the the great vision and the things you know and the or the man did which way it is whipped off the tot and looked down in there he saw these things he went West and come back and preached the Seven Seals The Plan of Redemption that light had not shined upon but truly this is one thing that we see we talk about the the Mysteries Paul would speak a lot of about Mysteries and he says that the The Mystery of the engrafting of the Gentiles right and that's a great understanding amen of how that there was a group of people to receive eternal life that would not be the chosen Israelite you know or Jew right but would even be Gentiles dogs right but yet it's a mystery and then look back and we can see tops and shadows of you know Ruth and Boaz and you know Rahab the Harlot coming into the lineages and the things and we can see and say well the Gentiles were spoke of and on this fifth seal there's hardly anything whatsoever that was even spoke of because we didn't realize what Paul was saying right when he said all Israel shall be saved we argued well does that mean this or does that mean that or does that mean this it means exactly what he said all the chosen predestinated will be saved brother R says those that had their name on the lounge Book of Life and it remained amen then we can get into invisible Union and understand that there can be a transferring of names right right that Israel could have her name name still left in the book but not go into the Eternal section of the book until she receives eternal life right then she will realize Redemption but looking at them and seeing ourselves what is the greatest message of Grace it could ever be that God would save a group of people that don't want it right then you'll see that it's Grace for you and I right think on these things as we go along let's go ahead and you know this was even closed up so much until the prophet of God he didn't see those seals until 63 right right amen all right this mystery of redemption was sealed up even after even though he preached 1 2 3 and four sure ab and brought in the Journey of the Antichrist and the things Y and even curries it to death and CES it to the white thr judgment and the rejection into the things right and yet he says the Lord had to speak to him that morning because see he thought her that day right he thought this was the martyred right Saints amen all right so let's start right there go ahead brother look number one this is paragraph 215 of the fifth seal notice now the ninth verse sold under the altar now here's where I'm going to get some real disagreement but just watch just a minute just see I thought that too y but it didn't come out didn't come that way amen we I've always thought that these Souls under the altar were the martyrs of the early church yep that's what he thought sure and I'm sure that Dr U Smith and every one of them says it and all and I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't it it isn't the soul it's not the Marty n right he said show division so he saw this and without even just to say a MH a thought coming to him right he said he saw the vision amen look at the next one now which is a continuation of reading but this is paragraph 28 now for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being opened see the church is gone it just can't be the sold under the the early church now now please if you ever did give this attention now cuz this is a great controversy so I want you to listen real close now and you got your papers and things to write them now I want you to notice now these cannot be them Souls because the souls of of the righteous martyr and the rightous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in the Rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation they was taken up now who are these Souls then see that's the next thing who are they that they if they are not the early church who is it then this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation all of them that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel itself you say oh wait a minute see people to argue with it y but it's Israel to be saved as a nation it is not talking about the 144,000 it is not talking about the Israel of the Old Testament because they have their Plan of Redemption right amen it is talking about those killed from Calvary mhm up until now right that were blinded amen I know people don't like that part either they don't like that they want to make some form of blinded they they don't understand what I'm getting at they say well they blinded theirselves no you blind yourself you lost that's right amen I hope people get that idea right those Jews those people that blinded them yeah are not the chosen of Israel right amen those that blinded the people back there can't claim this point of Israel cuz they blinded all right but you see they were blinded for you and I right amen amen if they were not blinded salvation would not have come to you and I but it's all right brother D but I just don't like the point of of you saying God blinded them well Who blinded them come on now amen that's right well they blinded yourself I just covered that you blind yourself you got a problem right amen right but think about it God is the only one that can blind anybody that's right right no no no the devil blinded people I thought we understood that but I thought we understood that God permitted him to do what he done come on you say well now all right you go on with your blindness then all right you calling me blind brother Dale no I'm not calling you blind you're calling your own self blind right the understand because that's is what I've always preached people who blind themselves are lost right right amen but when God came the way he came your Prophet said it blinded them right now I covered it Wednesday night that if the foolish virgin truly you have to say that she's blind to the truth then God don't destroy her right he gives her eternal life one day that's right amen that's right so he can deal with Israel see the Plan of Redemption so what did he say this is the Israel to be saved as a nation go with number three the last Gentile bride to be brought in for the bride the bride the blindness come to Israel for that purpose for so all Israel shall be saved and is it written there shall come out a design of deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob now you you'll see it in a minute that'll coveres right on the end of that six-fold purpose right now they are Israel that's under the altar what Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved you believe that now Who blinded them God God blinded his own children that's right all right now I'm not talking about everybody that's blind right I Do cover that right we're only talking about the F seal Jew that's blind we ain't talking about Gentiles that are blind or who's blind we're talking about this group of people let be blind all right now watch the next one 227 no wonder Jesus standing there at the cross look and then Jews howling for his blood that was his own kids y look what he covered and he was the scripture you understand what he's meaning he knew what was going on right you see what the prophet is say in other words he's the word he he knows what's going on he knows what them people's doing yes right but he knows also what he's going to do right right come on and he was the scripture he was himself the word and here he knowing that those people would have gladly received him and that's the reason he blinded them right so that they wouldn't recognize him y now you better get into the thought of what we're trying to bring because if those people would have gladly received him right and he done anything to keep them from receiving him he can't judge them Noe sure not man mhm Y and he would be overriding your freeo agency y That's it because they would want to be saved now that's what he said come on you just talk to talk to God and the prophet don't argue with me about it I don't have time fool with you he blinded them so they wouldn't recognize him once he come in such an humble way and blinded them to it y that they wouldn't receive it you see they already they had it figured out he going to come riding in on some great warrior you know going to kill them Romans and take over and and all this at the other you know or he was going to come down and they'd be a carpet rolled all the way right up to cus the high priest he'd walk up and oh cus you stayed with the word I come to you since doing that he's born as a baby amen exactly the way the Bible said he would come that's right now is the prophet saying anything wrong no he come in such an humble way he said well well that's what blinded the people because it's so they was reading the word they knew the Messiah was to be born right MH Isaiah 9:6 said so y yep right but you see they had it figured out right could that be you and me right brother there I think it's just a way oh good Constitution permits that Bible don't but you see what he's saying yes they would have received him that's right so he had to do something mhm that's right well no he just comeing on boy yeah why is it that we'll get to it in a minute that the Bible says they had eyes and can't see ears and can't hear right right come on Church Jesus pied them in so much as he said father forgive them yeah they don't know what they're doing they were blind Paul said they were blinded for a cause for us Jesus said father forgive them now that would be applied to everybody that was standing there if they had the right attitude but the wrong attitude made a lot of people standing there yep that'll never never be saved amen that's right cuz they blinded themselves the prophet of God you remember what we bringing out Wednesday the foolish virgins in the seal book what did he say those who never heard the message right are those who were blinded by false Shepherds amen preachers in this message in other words that's right amen is blinded the people to the truth y right now if I do that deliberately I go to hell right amen that's right but you be blind you might make it to heaven right yep do you see where I stand and where I preach that's right but look they were blinded Paul said they were blinded let's go to the scripture now and just read it and we're going to basically read the entire 11 chapter but I want you to think about it and think about what I said there a moment ago God opened Paul's eyes you know why why did God give wisdom to Solomon that's it amen and remember wisdom is different than understanding and knowledge right remember I might do the message with it why did he give him wisdom because he asked him for a way to lead his people amen right so he gave him wisdom to know how to lead his people Paul said I would be a cast away if it were possible for my people the Bible say about Isaiah stand us continually pleading see right right anybody that's ever had salvation wants to deliver to somebody else right like I've always told you salvation is the only thing I want to give away yep I want to give it to you amen but how many preachers would be a cast away for their own people brother right you can see what they're doing today we'll get off that look what Paul said 13th 11th chapter of Romans 13th verse we're going to go way down now so we're going to read we're going to see if Paul really saw something so went right in there and spoke of it for I speak to you Gentiles in so much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office if by any means I may provoke to emulation you know stir them up them which are my flesh and might save son of them some of them I speak to you Gentiles remember he went to the Jews right that's right but they wouldn't have Paul that's right y right but he said lo I turned to the Gentiles right God said through the man there said I'm going to show him what he's going to suffer from me y I'm going to send him to the dogs that he's been so much against all of his life I'm going to send him to the Gentiles with salvation y I'm not even going to let him go to my people y I'm going to send him to the dogs Paul was speaking about I preach to you dogs I preach to you gentille to try to bring you in try to stir you up but his mind was on his people he wanted to see his people sa right sure and was he wanting to see him saved as just individuals to come into the body of Christ why didn't he stay with the Jews no he wanted to save his people the nation of Israel he wanted salvation for his people what about you if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh you talking about Jews right Israel and may might save some of them and he did right some of them came into the body of Christ to be there but what about the rest of them now let's cover that for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world remember what we read the prophet said he blinded them for we for we could come in right look or if the casting away of them what the Jews be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiveing of them be but life from the dead mhm well won't will it be they'll come to it one day y for if the first fruit be holy yep remember we are not the first fruit Israel is the first frot amen we are not the root Israel is the root we're grafted in right right all right y for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches why because the root is Holy right come on the tree brother Ram saw that all kind of things on it said will it ever put forth another Orange He said yes but it'll have to be from the original root right come on and if some of the branches be broken off right and thou being a wild Olive Tree were grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree so our BAS is upon Jewish this is Jewish roots this is not Gentile Roots boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee all right thou W say then mhm the branches were broken off that I might be GR in right well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high minded but fear in other words don't build yourself up too good you know folks for if God Spar not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and sovereignty of God on them which which fail listen the goodness and the nature the servant which would go to Servant Hood the understanding how great God is on them which fail y who he talking about Jews servant but toward word thee good if thou continue in goodness right otherwise Thou shalt be cut off right and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be grafted in that's right you remember there's a covering over their heart but Paul says that one day that'll be taken away that they'll see but God is able to graft them in again right he hasn't forgotten Israel or if th were cut off cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and work grafted contrary to Nature to a good Olive Tree see in other words what you do you don't you you take a a wild Olive Tree you take the Wild and you graft into if you're going to try to hybrid it and bring it up and do the thing you take a wild Olive roots and you you Graft in the T into it right a good one but it's not so with God I were cut off cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and work grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural Banes be grafted into their own olive tree right future event amen right m mhm for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery y let you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in you feel still Jew come on and so all Israel shall be saved now I've got it in here so don't worry about it not ever Israelite right but the chosen of Israel that's right amen so all Israel shall be saved now that's a bold statement what are you talking about Paul I'm talking about all of the chosen of Israel right the predestinated let me I'm quoting brother brandom for references in later in the quotes the ones whose names remain on the book the natural nation of Israel is where these people come from and here they are yeah but brother Dale you said it you taught us that yes they will the natural nation of Israel amen will not be saved in the tribulation period That's Right none of them will be saved in the tribulation right of the natural nation of is Israel the 144,000 will come out of Israel yes right right that's the part to be saved come on get it all right and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written yeah let spoke of in the scriptures yep you got your Bible to over to the side of and they'll tell you where that's coming from mhm I think it's Isaiah isn't it so all Israel shall be saved even as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliver and that scripture says come to Zion right over there I think it's in Isaiah isn't it the deliver and she'll turn away ungodliness from Jacob it was spoke up in the Old Testament what this was going to be and this is my Covenant come on Isaiah 59 for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins amen amen there's your sixfold per amen all right now we're going to read where brother R puts that in there in a minute now so don't just think this is just me talking but look a covenant with them amen I thought we believed God gave Abraham an unconditional Covenant is not Abraham the father of the Jews or Israelites true Israel is really the way of saying it right cuz he was the first one called a Hebrew because it means one from the other side of the river and the Bible said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood so he really was a good Hebrew that's right they give it to him because they saw him cross the river come walking toward him oh your name is Abraham you're a Hebrew you just crossed the river the Bible said I brought him from the other side of the flood yep amen so I thought Abraham was to have an unconditional Covenant oh brother you're walking inside I love it because when I can walk in that word I don't have to worry every Israelite will never be saved no way that's right but every true Israelite that is a Covenant right Israelite amen will one day be saved and folks I thought that we believe that we were the Seed of Abraham by faith right and I thought that we didn't have anything to do with our Salvation come on I thought that's the way we believed it well but brother d i right that's what you've done but the Bible said no man sought God and your Prophet told us we didn't that's the Bible said the goodness of God is what leadth the to repentance oh you're getting into Redemption that's you around we seeing that Paul spoke of this yeah so no wonder he said right I went up and I saw things that are not lawful me to even talk about if he was talking about all Israel to be saved and the world is arguing the religious world is arguing what that Paul was saying when he said all Israel be saved before they come up we Baptist we had that figured out all Israel is not Israel all Jews not Jews all this that Bo we're smart well we did out some much figured out we certainly didn't see what Paul was talking about right but brother Dale I've just always been taught that if I don't seek God God can't seek me where's that at in the Bible I want the quote from the prophet and I want the Bible for you never sought God right look at even a man like the Apostle Paul that God had to run him down and bury his nose in the dirt right to get him to even think about being saved amen because he thought he always was what about the feel of this message yeah come on come I've always was eternal I don't have to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I come in the world eternal life and I want the prophets message on that I want the Bible right right if you can't have it then I don't give a hoop what you got right amen cuz it won't fit the word it's time to be plain I always thought it was pretty good anyway but look this is my Covenant unto them not you and I unless we come into it by a new birth but they have a covenant that they won't be annihilated my brother R says in the Bible our word speaking and this generation shall not pass away even Scofield picked that up brother brother said that's a Divine promise that Israel would never be wiped off of the face of the Earth we thought it was some help but even Scofield had that much understanding sure listen for this is my Covenant when I shall take away their sins sixfold purpose as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake that's it oh the natural nation of Israel right but as touching the election come on they sealed you come on folk that's right as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake amen read your Bible right I CH to just read it y make it verse by verse I'd love to be able to do that all the time with the Bible just I love to do that just take it just take one verse right after another I said that 40 years ago ain't got back to it yet I going to do that one day so I'm doing a little of it listen as concerning the gospel they are enemies that's it for your sake see what makes them enemies is the fact that they never re they don't accept Jesus Christ right that's right so they're enemies but that's touching the election now I love the next verse when you put it that way Y for the gifts and callings of God are because I repented because I was so good yeah well it's because I cried and prayed and S him read your scripture amen for the calling gifts and callings of God are without right repentance so you never repented to get something right you repented or ought to because of feeling knowing how sorry you was right amen amen listen that's your FAL youw that's the all Israel that will be saved not every Israelite not every Jew they wouldn't call Jews until you come on down into the scripture matter of fact that first time the word Jew is mentioned is in the Jew or Jews is mentioned in the Book of Esther and it's mentioned of Mori was a Jew but I can't find it to place it in the scripture to show exactly what I'm talking about but I can find it in brother R's message brother R said the Jew refers to the tribe of Judah Judah amen don't I believe what the scriptures I mean what he's saying right listen for as ye in times past I not believe God y yet have now T Mercy through your unbelief what good thing we do to get saved right that's right well I I I never did drink and I never did smoke and chew or anything I never run around with women I never had this or that or the other I was never a prostitute talk about the girl the sister I I was always true and God saved me because of that you religious hypocrite all is screaming out against you what goodness did you have what goodness do we have now bless God I don't cut my hair I don't wear no pants I don't I'm a Christian that don't make you a Christian that should be the attributes of being a Christian right you should do that because you're a Christian whereas in times P have not for ye in times P have not believed God yeah have now obtain Mercy through their unbelief right their unbelief you received it through their Israel's unbelief you and I to come in are you reading even so have these also now not believed come on even so have these also now not believed y that through your mercy y they also May obtain Mercy did you read that y amen no wonder where's it El not in there back of the out of sign comes a deliverer when we were over in Israel Ruben he said Sam I fought in four Wars he said pray for the Peace of Israel I said I do every day that was really playing for the 144,000 right the true Israel right why that they might come in and you know what they will one day right cuz the Bible says it will so read it again even so have these like what for as in times past for ye as in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief then why wouldn't we want them sa why wouldn't we want them to get the word why wouldn't we want them come on why would we not want them saved but you see we're blinded like Martin Luther said the Jews ought to be got killed even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy right for God have concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all yes yes all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom amen you remember that amen you remember the message wisdom not knowledge and understanding right wisdom comes first cuz you don't know how to use your knowledge right right unless you got wisdom which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right oh of the dep of the riches both of wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments in his ways P finding out well now I'll tell you what so I just I I don't believe that is because you you're making salvation without Jesus Christ I've done preach the message for nobody goes to heaven without Jesus Christ am all right Old Testament newest Testament foolish virgins they s Jew nobody goes to heaven without Jesus Christ F in the briide right you accuse me of that but I always thought we had to be born again yes well we used to all think that didn't we yes then we begin to read the Bible find out a little about F about foolish versin right Matthew 25 then we found out hey there is somebody maybe that's going to heaven that's not born again then we found out about 144,000 y now we're finding out about Israel amen okay all right let's prove a couple of points go ahead and number six this is 222 the the seal paragraph 222 oh yes there to be saved here let's settle it just a moment let's see what yeah okay I'll take one let's take Romans just a minute and find out if they are let's take the book of Romans so now the reason I'm giving you this is because showing you that he was verifies what we're talking about in The Book of Romans okay just started he said 11 chapter 25 26 and listen to what Paul and Paul you know said for an angel from heaven can preach any other thing let him be a curse he said I wouldn't have you be ignorant Brethren of the mystery therefore blindness is a part has come to Isel look at the next one this is the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel paragraph 43 see we read over the I admit I did when I read Daniel 70 weeks I was only dealing with 144,000 couldn't figure out how to do what to do with the other 24,000 CU remember that in the in the seals you remember Dan and Ephraim was taken out back under there was originally supposed to have been 13 tribes y it was in the children of Israel and when they sinned Dan and ephra did they were taken out and Joseph and Levi was place 10 to make the 12 tribes in the book of of Revelations that where you're dealing with the 144,000 what are you dealing with Dan and Ephraim is left out until they return and when they return what are you going to do with the other 24,000 that takes their place thank God I know where they're at now I know where to go with I always wondered what are you going to do with that 24,000 Brother Gary you mean you just going to throw them away no can't no paragraph 43 six more purpose of G until God is finished with the Gentiles Israel was blinded not just speaking 144,000 right they went off into sin and transgressions against God because God blind their eyes that we might be drafted in you get it 26th verse now and all Israel shall be saved he may have not known that FAL Jew and what it was dealing with but he sure being a prophet he knew how to put the word together now do you see why brother randam was say that's reason I said I'll give some of these things to way where you can pick it up because the prophet said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you won't understand the seals so youd miss the fifth one Y come on you totally missed the fifth seal without the Daniel 70 week right amen and you'd Miss Revelations 12 yep 13 and all the things he listed guard you miss look and all Israel shall be saved God blinded them perfectly uni they cannot see God blinded them and all Israel true Israel shall be saved what did the angel say to finish the transgression of Israel I've come to tell you that there will come a time when Israel's transgression will be finished that's not just 144,000 right that's that F still Jew God will cut off that wild branch and graft into that back that real Branch again oh sometimes it makes my heart junk to see them poor isra people cut off that under not knowing where they're going and think that God in his Mercy did that so I could be saved blinded their eyes from their own Messiah shut their ears up that they could not hear him it look right at his miracles and look right at his miracles and things that he was doing they look right at him and couldn't see right go to the next 46 Matthew I believe the 12th chapter or the 8th or the 12th chapter matter of fact that's Matthew 13:15 right you know if you want to write it down he's a human being you know right he could give up on his scriptures because in Matthew 15 13:15 is where this scripture the Matthew I believe the 12th chapter or the 8th or the 12th chapter said though Jesus said had Jesus had done so many miracles yet they could not believe because God said they got eyes and they can't see and ears and they can't hear unless they would see with their eyes and hear with their ears and I would convert them see I used to just think that's because they blinded theirselves no it's because he blinded them the ones that blinded themselves is not the ones I'm dependent upon of the roots that's carrying me come on Don said they said sometimes you get sometimes I do get upset at the stupidity and carnality of us that's right bunch of preachers and car the things twisting this message that's right amen but so that we could have a change he pulled a curtain down on his own children's eyes right turn his own children away from the table and turn them off to leanness of spirit that he might find that we might have a chance to life give us life 26th verse now he's back in Romans so all Israel shall be saved it is written there shall come out of Zion to deliver the out of Zion because this is where it's coming the message is going to go and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob run that scripture back in your reference and you'll see that it says two Zion yeah because it was back there coming to Zion now it's out of Zion going to Israel see yes he will come to Mount Zion one of these days watch upon the Mount of Olives they recognize him and all Israel will know it's him now there's your 144,000 MH the Gentiles will be finished then that Branch that's been grafted in God will take them take from it the fruit that's been gathered and that wild Branch will be yep go to the next one still in the six full purpose PR he is now remember and on back in here as you read he said if that Roots was holy and that Roots was a holy root also the fruit that comes up from that Holy root will bring holy fruit and if that root was Jesus Christ who is both root and offspring of David if that life was in him come up through the Jewish generation and was cut off from them come up through the Jewish root remember Christ in the Old Testament right right and cut off from them and their eyes blinded that we might see our lives will have to pattern with a blessed Branch oh yes brother that's right why can't we weep for them right why can't we weep go ahead to the next one paragraph 49 still in God cut them all purposely and blinded their eyes so that we can have a chance to see giving us an opportunity and we will rock around like mhm we're somebody Paul tells them here take heed of how you do that take heed for if God sped not the natural Branch how will he have an have any more Mercy on the wild Branch that's already so we walk around and say I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm Pentecostal that don't mean nothing to God we got to be born again of that Holy Spirit that come from the root he come and remember he's not speaking of the Gentiles I'm just throwing this in here so that you can see where the Gentiles had their change but he come to finish the transgression make a finish of it that's right in the transgression right if I go any further I got a bunch of scriptures to read so we'll pick up right there this afternoon continue to the thought I hope you see what I'm talking about amen amen amen amen amen yes sir Daniel 70 weeks is dealing with amen Israel as a nation yes right now to show you some keys somebody is going to preedee us here and build a millennium Temple right and I don't think that it's going to be some goofball American I think it'll be Israel amen that's right yep amen I always thought I'll pick this up this afternoon and car the thought on I've always believed having to change some thoughts that I'm having yes but I've always believed the Millennium is to Israel yep because it's a promise to David that his son would sit on his throne Solomon in the natural but one day Jesus Christ will set on that throne in the Millennium and it ain't going to all be Gentiles that's surrounding it no right we know for a certainty the 144,000 would be in the Millennium the prophet said M right is he going to leave out to 24,000 to keep them from being in the Millennium I don't think so but where is all that Israel come for no is Israel is a nation right in the Millennium yep that's Le thing have we left Israel out of the Plan of Redemption right is there a way that she could be redeemed I'm talking about Israel as a nation I'm not talking about Old Testament Jews I covered that now I'm talking about the Israel as a nation from Calvary until the end the fifth seal Jew we going to do with her yes Lord amen and brother brandham says that when he comes in the Millennium to the 144,000 then they'll see him in a body they don't see him in a body until that time that's right they see him through two witnesses that's right right he's coming in the Millennium let me make another statement the Millennium is in him the Millennium is in Jesus Christ right right there won't be no Millennium without Jesus Christ right amen and all salvation is tied to Jesus Christ let's stand think on these things the more is unold holding right more is opening to us that we may see the Plan of Redemption amen where the Prophet said you would miss it in the Daniel 70 week said you'd miss it if you don't get this correct amen so You' Totally Miss the fal Jew if you didn't have Daniel 70 weeks cor cuz they got to have a place somewhere that their transgression comes to an end amen you're going to see one of these days why three then we keep making that drawing doing those things three of the sixfold purposes happening to the 144,000 that's right but three of those sixf purposes is in the Millennium and you'll see all of the things that's been said why it been said yep what do we got 161 one Inspire book anybody have a need let's just sing and worship nations are breaking Israel Awakening the for I know not able to
