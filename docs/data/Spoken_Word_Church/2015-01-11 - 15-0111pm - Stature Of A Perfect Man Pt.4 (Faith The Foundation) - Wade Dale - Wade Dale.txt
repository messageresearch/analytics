========================================

ah i've found a friend in jesus he's everything i see all i need to cleanse and make me fully hold in sorrow he's my comforter in trouble he's my stay he tells temptation is keeps me by his all the power forsakes me and satan tempts me through jesus i shall safely reach the good he'll never never leave me nor yet forsake me here while i live by faith and do his blessings with his see his blessed face where rivers are like to my soul he's the lily of the valley the bright and morning star he's the fairest don't forget now we put some more prayer claws up here if you didn't get one this morning you want to put them in your house put them over your door try to get rid of all of these bugs and things that's around you know if you come at the house and open the medicine cabinet door there's a bear claw stick in there right why because that's the way we were to believe it right when you get your medicine sanctified just like you do eating what's the problem right i mean it take you just a couple of minutes to say a little prayer over it you know it might just work if you believe it if you believe it might work amen you're enjoying the series that way to bring them let's get ready to do that and remember now the fellowship meeting this coming saturday brother longoria alabama if you want to go with us let us know ahead of time be ready to go at 10 30 saturday morning we'll run over and be coming back you know that night and all and fellowshipping together we always stop somewhere and eat and have a good time the reason we leave a little early where there's no problems with all of the traffic and the doings and all so just remember that if you want to go with us all right let's just sing open the eyes of my heart while white comes to minister the word of the lord unto us amen open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see is that your desire i want to see open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i to see shining in the light of your glory shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy amen you want to see him turn around shake his hand say god yes hello there we go well josh told me said turn that microphone off they left it on so i turned it off and didn't turn mine on so i don't think you have a problem hearing me thank you sister i appreciate that i like i like this picture see this picture we're going to start using it a little bit as kind of a background um and that kind of shows you uh what we're talking about amen christ is the head we're the body man so we're the body of god but we must have these virtues in our life to be the body of god amen all right sure we're birthed into the body we're sons and daughters down here but he he'd look kind of funny having the head stuck down here on the feet now there's a there's a functioning body there's a lot of moving parts in between the feet and the neck that brings all this thing together so uh i kind of want to give you a little visual there to see and christ is the head that is what we are the christ is the head stone he's the one or what is stone revelation so he's the head revelation all right so uh if you want to let's go ahead and turn to second peter one and we'll uh continue our thought i hope this morning was okay we didn't uh get to where i wanted to get but uh but we can get to it now it's scratching we're trying to benny put brother benny said it was scratching this morning i think it may be coming from our from our collar how about that that better okay i'll be still i'm going to stand here all day just like this second peter chapter one no we'll be all right i like this bear and i do the harness because you don't feel anything on your head that thing would pull you know on your head so i like this underneath the collar but we just got to get used to it so just uh technology sometimes takes time but uh 2 peter 1 verse 1 and let's pray before we get started i know i know i i wanted sisters freedom them to sing that song because it struck me when we were when we were laying the prayer cloths out you know the the song says a wall of fire around me there's nothing now to fear so that's what we got to do we got to get a wall of fire around us amen uh what happened to gaheza and elijah gaheza said in other words there's only two of us here you know and elijah says no more of us than they are them he said open my servant's eyes right so you can see when he did he said there's ring of fire chariots all around that prophet in geheza so we got to see that rim of fire around us to take care of all these natural problems that we got right okay i want to take care of these natural problems because we are we're working on the spiritual man but we got to have that natural man sharp too so that he can uh enjoy the service and not not be sick and you know how sickness it does it takes your mind away from things that's what satan likes he likes to take our mind away from stuff by giving us a sickness or a worry what have i got what's going to happen how long is it going to be out my temperature is going to be this i'm going to be out of work it's all that worry and that fear so let's just take that fear out know that it's the devil know that he's trying to stop you and then just stand there and wait on god to manifest himself so let's pray before we get started the heavenly father we pray today lord that you would sanctify us one more time for this journey that we're on forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord we pray that you just touch the ones that are sick lord be with them raise them up for your honor and glory lord truly let there be a wall of fire around us the holy spirit take care of all the things that we have lord the little sicknesses and the worries and the problems lord i pray that you would take them all away lord that we'll look to your word that will believe that your words are truth and that it's our absolute lord and i pray that you should be with each one lord take care of the ones that are not here the ones that are away for different things lord be with brother louise take care of him lord raise him up lord we all bind together and bind that power of satan that's trying to stop his voice from being heard over there in the foreign countries we pray that they'll have a very successful time even from now on lord we pray that you're just blessed take care be with us lord as we open your word and read it may you bless the hearer and the speaker in the name of jesus christ amen ii peter 1 simon peter a servant and apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith so who's he's talking to he's talking not to him he's talking to us okay like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according as his divine power they see that divine power has given us now we ain't got to the virtues yet when i got to the virtues he's talking about we're talking about the divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to the life and godliness all right the way we live our life and how to live it godly through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the prophet said these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature can't partake of the divine nature until you do this having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all right stop period and besides this besides this divine nature beside this being a partaker of the divine nature of god and beside this giving all diligence there's that word diligence again add to your faith virtue and diverse your knowledge and all these temperance temperance patience and i'm really going to be glad to get into all these because there really will help us i think and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if there's that word if that little word that's very big if these things be in you and abound in you not around you or an anointing that just comes on you while you're at church right if these things be in you then everywhere you go you carry them with you right okay if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ listen there's only one thing that we as christians should be looking for and that's to be number one be in love with god and waiting for that body change because it's not going to happen a baby is not going to take a body change jesus wasn't a baby he was a man right all right he was a man when his body was changed all right but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins that's why there has to be there had to be a remembrance in the old testament every year of sin remember you read that in hebrews that every year the high priest went behind the veil and he made an atonement for the sins and people forgot about it same thing with you and i now even if the new birth sometimes we forget things and we forget that we were purged from our old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence there's that word again to make your calling in election sure for if you do these things you shall never follow right you lord man is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated but remember this morning as we're talking about the foundation we put it as being required obviously it is but i don't think and i think i was talking to somebody between the break that um most people don't feel it's a requirement so it's not preached on that much it's just it's just that we're in this age and we're up here and that's the automatic process that since we're in the last age we are we got all this and we're just waiting on we're waiting on the bus to pull up as brother dale always says but that's not the truth we all start down there at faith and then we go to virginia's tempers all the way up to the capstone and remember bring the bring the full picture up brother bob's running it today so thanks brother bob for doing that but you see this is the full stature the only way to get into this is to be born again right all right we're going to talk about faith this evening because you are going to have to believe in something i know there's an old song i think it's an old country song said if if you can't don't stand for nothing you'll fall for anything you know and that's the truth if you don't stand for something you got to put you it doesn't matter even when you were a sinner there was things that you that you said this is the way it is and this is the way it is and this is where there was something that you stood for but now we're talking about now life and godliness we're taking those things life you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything you'll fall for any doctrine you'll fall for any slight of the devil you know i'm quoting scripture really any slight of the devil or cunning craftiness remember we read it this morning how that false teachers come in and they you know give you something to that they'll give you a false hope right okay but we're talking about the faith of god the new birth is not the faith of the devil or anyone else the new birth is the faith of god being delivered to you you have to believe to see right right not see to believe right all right you say well i don't see myself coming to whatever well that means you don't believe right right or maybe let's put it this way maybe you don't understand how to get it like i was talking about the electrician with with brother tim you you you don't know how to get there because you can have the new birth and not be taught well and not know how to get to a place right okay and what the problem is is when you get the preachers of the message because see peter had to have these virtues working in his life for him to be able for it to be in the eternal word of god he could not preach it presumptuously right brother branham didn't preach anything presumptuously what he preached he saw amen all right because if he didn't then then he's remember what he said he said if if god don't break those seals he said we're just what presuming right right and presuming is it is venturing without authority and that's the problem with a lot of people the message they venture out without the authority god i've got they have the power but they don't have the character yet right okay so power apart from characters what satanic but power with character is fit to what rule you and i must have dominion to me all in a nutshell you don't ever have to come back anymore this is the whole message this is dominion yeah this is the dominion of uh we have lost the dominionship of our patients that's why we need to have the patience of god right because i believe that adam walked in the garden of eden with these virtues because he had the holy ghost and the holy ghost are these virtues right now what did he do now when adam was walking on the into the garden of eden before the fall adam would say that's a lion that's a tiger wind stop wind blow and remember god wasn't looking over his shoulder come on god wasn't looking over his shoulder going now adam i wouldn't call that a tiger no adam was the son of god he had the mind of god god was working through him and god said that's what that'll be for an eternity adam named the animals and they'll never be different right so he had dominion genesis 1 26 let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and all the creeping things on the earth this is dominion because remember when brother branham came to that mountain the storm and the deer and all those things remember he had become he was at the stage of adoption where it wasn't it wasn't god speaking it was brother brown speaking right yeah but it was god speaking you understand what i'm saying but god trusted what he said remember remember he told brother brown he said whatever you say you're out here hunting you're out here doing these things you're out here doing these things what do you need you speak it right all right now he wasn't right here that didn't happen in 1947 but remember the first message brother branham preached was what faith the substance last sermon he preached was bob communion all right first sermon was faith last sermon that's the communion with god right there amen sure your communion with god here it's like like bob and i were discussing just a few minutes ago you have a you know your your wife and you have a the only way i can understand god is by natural things yeah i mean you even when you say supernatural there's a natural in there right supernatural so it had to come we had to learn it naturally like you and your wife you know you your wedding night you consummate the wedding and and it's you know it's like the love between you and god but remember then you learn each other on through the time right that's not just that's not just it you learn you learn to love and learn to do these things same thing with god because your relationship with god starts at the new birth right all right it doesn't stop there it continues on it continues on until it comes to the headstone to where it's like it's like the analogy we use somewhere that uh a little boy five or six years old he's a human he has a brain you know take brother west back there take him your boy he's a human right he's got two eyes on it we got out now you got two eyes on each side of his nose he's got on each side of his nose but now give him your car keys let him drive you home today no no don't shake your head he's a human he's just the same thing you are he ain't got a hairy face like you do but soon he will but give him your car keys he's got every faculty you got right he's got everything you got he's a human being he's your son you should trust him driving a car same way with god god's not going to give you the keys to his car right here he's going to give you the keys to the car up here right he's not going to give you the keys down here yet you are a son right right robby how many people kids have you stopped driving a car at five years old i hope none you stop adults right okay so then they are able by watching by what's instilled in man we come to a place where we say what 16 years old you are mature enough to handle driving a car but now let's go a little bit further you take that 16 year old and you don't give him the key to a 250 mile an hour dragster same car four wheels steering wheel brakes clutch it just goes faster so what does he have to do when he turns 16 he has to learn and grow right to drive faster and that's the same way with god that's the way i see it when i started to baby form with god when i started at faith god give me all the things i needed i was always i was a kid i was crying but i was unskillful i only could drink milk but you know what there was a desire in my heart to eat strong meat because see i could look i could look at the adults and say man i'd rather eat that steak than to eat these peas ground up in this baby food you eat right i mean how many of you would want to eat ground up green peas right now no but you know what at one time that's all you can handle right same way with god that's why i said why don't we try to grow with god as the same way that we see ourself grow up because even the godhead can be understood by the things you see all right same thing with adoption they never adopted a little boy that boy had to come to an age to where he could be responsible enough to handle what you give him same way with god same way with god he's not and you know what he doesn't expect you to drive a car at five years old right he don't expect you to do the things at five that you you know that you would do at 50 or whatever but with god there's no you know there's no time limit with god right i've seen some 18 year old people that come into the message get born again be on fire with god that's got a lot more understanding than the people spending the message for 30 years or 40 years but it's what but you know what it's what you make yourself available for that's what we're trying to do here is we're trying to make this available where we can all grow don't leave nobody behind we want everybody to grow but there's one thing for sure we're not all going to get to the same place at the same time right so just understand that just to understand that and you know what there are some 16 year olds that i wouldn't give a car key to yet the law legally says he can drive or she a lot of sheath but i wouldn't give them the keys why because of the maturity because of their background because of their training that's the same way with god we need to be skilled in the word of god and the only way we can be skilled in the word of god is to hear it let it come from here down to here i like we're sharing sharon sharon says not up here down here right and that's right right you get it all up here but when it don't go down to here i like that very simple not here here that's what we're trying to do with this this is not head knowledge of god right this is the knowledge that god puts in here that he wants it to work out he wants to uh and i don't think i have it but we'll read it later on he wants us to be a walking instrumentality of god right that's what he wants for all of us but we got to start with a foundation of faith all right now so if these things are a requirement we can't skip one we've got to grow in grace and knowledge we've been here 50-something years since the prophet preached we're still here the reason we're still healed is because i'm not ready i'm not ready that's the reason i'm still here we're all still here because i'm not ready because remember we all go together right so i'm blaming me you need to blame you okay i'm not gonna blame you because i don't know where you are you got to blame you and if you're still sitting here and you're not raptured you need to blame you praise the lord india so now then we look and we see that the headstone was rejected now to take that away is is not that god went away somewhere man's ideas took that away that's right right god didn't ever leave but the fullness of god left it always let me try to put it right it's always been in the word but down through the time in in saying nicea you know the first three church ages they had all these things working in their life right right all right so you get to the fourth church age which is columba you see that they have they eroded it they eat all the effects of the word down and then there had to be a restoration so the head like i said this morning the head had to become a corner right right he didn't leave he just come down here and you know what he's done he's hiding himself sure he's hiding himself down here in the foundation so that he can grow right back up if a corn of wheat die and go on the ground it'll bring forth much fruit but if you don't put it in the ground it'll bite it alone right he would have been the only one could come to maturity but it's not true he wants us all to come to maturity all right so he had to start down here brother donnie had to give us an example that same example that walked on the earth had to be the very first baby example that we have down here amen all right do everybody understand that so when you see cornerstone and headstone sure he's the headstone of the church he's the head which is what the intelligence everything that happened from the neck down has to happen from what's up here right all right amen amen all right has to happen up here first and it goes through here down into your body same way with god it all starts with the head then it flows down through the body because remember sister shepherd's dream they were pouring the water in and the water was boiling out the trash being washed by the water of the word the water was running it out and doing away with our contrary virtue contrary knowledge i said contrary to god our contrary temperance he's burning or pouring or boiling all that brother brown said boiling boiling all that trash out and remember the trash was running down the side of that mountain same way with you and i he's trying to burn the trash out so it's run down the side of the mountain but there's only one way to do that and that's by the new birth right no other way you can you can you know you can make this thing alcoholics anonymous you can suppress that demon so much that's what's happening now these people leaving the message the people turning the message down they never was born again right you can't leave the apex of the of the word and and say that you're born again right so what they done was though just trudy they just suppressed all that back stuff they just suppressed all that down and but you know what happened it's still there still you hide it right it don't go away so i said this this christianity is not alcoholics anonymous and for those of you that don't know and hadn't been through the program alcoholics anonymous is once an alcoholic always an alcoholic you've just got to suppress that thing you've got to do things different you've got no no i don't believe that brother brown said remember that girl georgie carter i believe it was or one of the girls uh that he said she was an alcoholic she was a prostitute he said now she's a wife she's testifying god and she's a christian woman same woman same woman right same person you see but the power of god took that old nature out okay we listen so i was gonna try to say that this morning everybody says you know they talk about the seed being in you and that's that desire listen people if you're a human being god put every human being from adam on this earth with a desire in their heart to serve god you know what the prophet of god said every person on this earth he gave you a desire to serve god now what you did with it and i did with it we took that desire and we went to smoking we took that desire desire we went to drinking we took that desire and went to xyz it doesn't matter but it was a desire to serve god to begin with it's that old nature that we lean to that's contrary to any of this our old nature has a temper don't have a lot of patience definitely ain't got no godliness you understand what i'm saying so what it has to be it has to be not that we suppress it it has to be a total conversion justified is the path we take to start with justification all right we turn from our old sin and we start in a new direction all right we'll get into that in just a minute but let's just to review all this we talk about the cornerstone now we're coming up to where we were talking about faith this morning and we re we read the quote where brother bynum said he said leave it right there we said or he said he said that your faith is going to determine how high you go right okay it's your faith but what what you're going to have to have is is you're going to have to have faith in what a five-fold ministry says didn't i read ephesians 4 he gave some apostles prophets pastors teaching and evangelists for the perfecting of the saints all right so that's how we got to get it we got to listen you got to hear can you get it from the prophet he said you couldn't he said i give it to the ministers and they break it down right okay that's why you know and and i don't want you to get this wrong but brother tim and i were talking about that because a lot of people are are beginning to realize and brother dale's always taught us this that brother branham was not our absolute you hear what i'm saying let me finish because brother branham was a human and he made mistakes just like i make mistakes but the word he brought amen but now remember not the word he brought on paper anybody okay not the word he brought on paper because the word he brought on paper is just what i said this morning they got polygamy two soul seven thunder it all comes out of the message the written part of the what brother branham said they're making all kind of denominations same way with god when god was on earth he wrote there was four books written matthew mark luke and john 30 000 denominations have come from that four those four gospels so it's not the written word that's an absolute it's the written word revealed amen it's the absolute amen so the written word revealed being the absolute we can take matthew mark luke and john and see that the prophet had to come to bring that together take the loose ends put them all back together and say look this is what jesus was saying right amen amen so it's not that that we we brother branham in in the purity of the messages are absolute right right because it's like brother william said the word is the highest apex of god so that's our absolute is the word of god revealed like god because you know what the baptist says god revealed me a trinity out of the bible right no he didn't right he didn't god didn't reveal the trinity to anybody right never was in the bible but man takes that out that's why the prophet had to come to straighten those things out get them all back together and you know what just like we talked about zerubbabel that's what he done he swept that thing off and started again he told the pentecostals he said he said you got to go through these three stages of grace he said you just don't come right here and go well i got the holy ghost because i shouted and spoke in tongues whatever that ain't it zerubbabel swept that foundation and started again and built what god started in the beginning that prophet of god brought us the whole apex of the word amen the prophet of god brought us that whole apex of the word but what our problem is is satan got into that and started injecting two souls seventh on you name the doctrine it doesn't matter because you know what that's not the doctrines doctrines like that never come through here now listen hold on a minute though babies can't be shook mature men cannot be shook women but babies can be shook right right let's read something here let's read number four we're going to start we're not going to read that go to quote number four brother bob we talked about this morning that uh thank you we talked about this morning we have to go through justification sanctification and baptism of holy ghost all right so here we're going to see we saw the analogy that brother brown made about the cup or the glass all right so watch what is redemption redemption is not replacement so we fail as human beings we fail so god's got to restore us back all right so in the restoring back sure the pure word of god had to come through the prophet of god to make us help us understand what god's really what he really was talking about so the plan of redemption is going to be just like the earth right just like the natural earth has got to go through it the spiritual earth has got to go through it first because remember who fell first the earth or man man fell first so everything under him fell in romans eight it says they became subject to the one that it failed they came subject when adam fell the the the animals fell all nature fell well now to take us back he can't start with the earth he's got to start with the one it fell from it's got to start with man when man gets back to the place then nature comes back to the place all right so that's what we're going to see right here and then we'll get started a little bit into into justification sanctification i know it's i know it's simple but sometimes we really need to understand are we really justified right are we really sanctified and honestly do we really have the holy ghost where we can start and begin for god to work in in our life all right so and notice how god makes plain this is on future home 1964. god makes plain to us his plan of redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when i saw it how he makes plain to us here now his plan of redemption now compare that we see with our compare what we see that's what i just told you compare what we see with our own eyes what we see the natural things that we see what god has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plan or anything such a glorious thing how he led us to himself to a tabernacle in us by three stages of grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come to the world as god will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of grace i taught that at the beginning see there's a doctrine in the in the message and i know a lot some of you heard it but somebody hadn't that brother branham changed his way he in other words when the seals open he got a greater revelation and it was just to believe the message that was a new birth we've all heard that one or the ones that had heard it know what i'm talking about but what do you say right here i taught that at the beginning i've never changed since why has he never changed since it's god's word you have to keep your threes together your sevens or twelves the numerics of the bible must run perfect or you'll get your picture all messed up if you can't understand it just keep praying you watch it'll cut right in exactly god is perfected in threes see notice how god makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from god when i see this and see that since a boy first time ever christ dealt with me i've still always taught those three stages now where'd he change where did he change he said since i was a boy i've taught these three stages of grace notice if it isn't true now now the first step is repentance toward god right and then follows after that is water baptism water baptism repent it says repent first repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ see water baptism follows showing that the repentance was genuine amen that's been our problem we've tried to get them to the water without getting them to repent if you get them to repent and then get them to the water much better much better line up there because it says here repent be baptized see what about this and follows showing that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with future sin everybody understand that say amen all right it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ what for remission taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future right right just your sin has been chopped off what you did now stop right there for a moment and it's a whole nother it's a whole another sermon but what he's doing is when he talks about future home with the earth for some of you that don't have a a background like the others the earth went through a water baptism right in noah's day right the flood washed the past sin of the earth off but remember sin still came across the ark once justification in the type of the world being you know everybody was killed except eight people right eight people was all that was saved on this whole world and the bible says as it was in the days of noah so it is today so there was as many people and more on the earth then as they are now right so it took and destroyed everybody but eight people but the very next day that they got off the ark noah made a sacrifice showing that the sin had come on across the earth why do you need a sacrifice if there's no sin so what justification does it chopped off their past sin same way with rahab the harlot how do you think she married that israeli general woman where are your accusers you know what jesus said to the woman they threw down in front of him woman where's your accusers he had to get rid of her accusers same way with rahab everybody was killed in the whole city except her and her family so all the accusers because remember she was a harlot right so she had friends you understand what i mean if they were all killed all of her witnesses were gone okay same way with you and i we did it we did it that woman that was in front of jesus when she was caught in the act of adultery she did the act he just didn't see it jesus didn't see it he couldn't but now if he had if though some of those people would have stayed there he would have had to let him stone her but he got rid of her witnesses and he said i didn't see you do it that's what he does now our sins are covered not just covered they're taken away and that's the same way with the earth the earth sins was wiped off but remember they started sinning the day noah got drunk they come on down and you know they started back sinning again right same way with justification it just chops off what happened in the past and then you got you keep walking you keep walking with number one having faith you got to believe that god cut your sins off if not you're just dragging them with you so see it starts all with faith believing what god said having a conscience of your sin but it being chopped off you can't repent for what adam done you've never done it adam did you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still there right okay all right the old nature is still there now look if you've got the old nature still there how's the room for this light and darkness can't dwell in the same place okay so you still got darkness you can't have light so see there's no way you can come up this statue of a perfect man having the old nature that you had before amen you can't have that old nature that old nature's got to be dead not put in a closet right we'll get to that in a minute then secondly come sanctification which sets your mind in order for holiness to think right taken away sanctification is a compound greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service not in service see it's sanctification you shouldn't be taking communion you shouldn't be you can't be deacon there's a lot of things you can't do because you're set aside for service you're not put in service yet right okay putting in service for god is putting you in the family amen right here this is what you get this is the household of god all right the rest outside the household of the devil and remember by that picture i showed you justification sanctification was outside the pyramid you're not in the family till you have faith until you help until you're born again all right second comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right take it away sanctification is a compound greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service now what in a type of the earth what happened that what did he say when jesus christ died on the cross he spilled his blood on the earth to cleanse and claim the bodies that were in the earth and all the bodies were in the earth right right to cleanse and claim the earth jesus shed his blood as a type of that sanctification but now remember did that do away with sin they just kept right on sinning 99 of the world never even knew jesus was on the earth amen then the next comes the baptism of the fire and holy ghost that god might dwell in us and the fire of god cleanses our heart from sin and puts the holy ghost inside i thought you already had it no you don't already have it you weren't born with the holy ghost i'm sorry naturally born right spiritually born yes naturally born no you had to receive the holy ghost listen why can't god come on this earth now why can't god come on this earth now all of his people are here he's hearing you and me why can't he physically step on this earth this earth has not been burned off for him to step his foot on this earth same way with you when you were in sin you didn't have the holy ghost right you didn't have the fire of god in you you had to fire the devil right i speak for all of us amen brother branham said he used to wash his car on sunday and watching people go by now if he had to fire god in him he had been in church right right you say a prophet yeah remember he was born a prophet right but he had to receive the holy ghost just like you did right man i said just like you did that's what he said then next comes the baptism of fire in the holy ghost that god might dwell in us in us and the fire of god cleanses our heart from sin and puts the holy ghost inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us notice in the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural life types to spiritual life now let me ask you a question on that one when the baby's in the mother's womb is it alive no it's not brother branham said it's nothing but wiggling muscles just like an animal if you need a quote i'll bring it to you but we know that right it is not a human being when it's in the womb that's what the prophet of god said and i believe it too because there's not there's not there's there's a life being brought forth right but that's just nothing but just the same as a as an animal at that point that's what he said and i agree with him when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural birth first thing happened breaking the water now my point was if we come here with an eternal life already in us he can't type that all right everybody understand what i said he can't type that because if he types it like this then the baby's already alive in the womb the baby's not alive in the womb the baby's not alive until the baby gets here after the water breaks after the blood comes then the spirit the life right grab the little felon spank him and away he goes screaming water blood spirit and now when a baby is born into the kingdom of god he comes the same way how about that now notice sanctification the third stage second stage he's meant the second stage of it cleanses the mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of holiness a man can repent of sins and he's still thinking of well maybe he's an immoral man every more looking woman he finds is still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells a drink it's still there see but then when he gets sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the one of it away he can still be tempted sure but he takes the one of it away still but look still he's not right yet right right you're not in this yet you're not in the family of god yet now look god knows whether you go on we'll go on or not but you don't right god knows who's he is you just don't know it you got to live it you got to go through the experience if not it's not your experience right pretty simple it takes one of it away still he's not right yet then he is baptized with the holy ghost and fire cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put into the service of god sanctification only sets them aside for service all right everybody understand that say amen amen okay and notice just exactly how that come the message come martin luther justification john wesley sanctification of the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the messages that's where there can't be no more ages of it see we're at the end time three stages baptism cleans the heart with the holy ghost glory that's what i mean about clean it cleans it takes that old nature and kills it right doesn't kill your soul your soul's you it it burns the nature off of that thing that's contrary to all this we're all born contrary to god right i just i just wish we'd i can see it burns my heart i can see more of how that it would be so easy to be born with an eternal seed and that would be just easier and and it would there would be no overcoming and no fighting you just always was this wonderful thing no i was going to hell right that's right i was going to hell and god amen came to me and said hey you want some of me and you either going to say yes or no and then if i said yes he said hey look at all these things i got for you how much better is that brother richard marlowe how much better is that in my heart to know that i had an experience right that i was on my way to hell and i had an experience with an eternal god glory and he thought so much of me he came down and burnt that thing out of me and then he put himself inside of me hallelujah amen benny told me not to move around much 101 kind of wake you up a little bit now he's called the church through justification called it through sanctification and then filled it with the holy ghost and fire and he took it through a process that he himself the holy spirit himself the son of god could dwell in the human heart now look it's not the human heart right the heart of the person is i'll read it in a minute now it has to go through that before he can come into it i thought it was already there no people we were all born in sin right shaping iniquity come forth into this world there's only one man that wasn't born contrary to god right that was god himself amen everybody else was born contrary to god because sex was not the way we were supposed to get here right right spoken word like it was when jesus come notice he done the world where that bride is going to live in the same way his same plan of salvation everybody got that glory the same plan now let's go to number five angel of the lord 1953 brother braham said the new birth is an experience it is a gift of god right it's the seal of your faith because peter doesn't say add to god's faith peter says add to your faith in other words add to what you believe in virtue add to what you believe in knowledge right all right the holy spirit is a seal ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god for by your seal until the day of your redemption right so put the um last picture back up there brother bob right there so we have to go through justification what is justification just to start over again what is justification turning around and going in another direction right god i'm i'm tired of living this i look people if i went through it you're gonna have to go through it right right if i'm a son of god and you're a son of god or a daughter of god if i went through it you got to go through the same thing right right i went through that right there i'm tired of what i was i don't want to do that no more god says okay but that's not all i come to church one night stood right here and give my heart to the lord now i may be a little different than some of you because i had a background as far as that goes being different i had a background when i was 14 12 11 10 i knew nothing but this message i was raised in this church sharon was raised in this church esther some of the ones that are here we were raised in this church but remember that don't give you free pass to the rapture sharon was telling me she said 30 years 30 years well sister 20 years i did my thing raised in the message knew what the message said but there was never a true justification there was always that little will i'll fall back over here but when i come to that point to where i was done with my past life i believe i came into true justification now i believe my sanctification may have come quicker than yours because i believe god had you know a work for me to do same way with you but see all the desire of all the things that i'd done like chewing tobacco and all the things that i did it went away that day so i may have went a little bit quicker because you got to remember one thing the the people at the 120 in the upper room when they received the holy ghost it quickened all that word that they held and they went from here they went from justification baptist whole ghost to right here in a very quick short period of time why they had a background of the word okay and that don't give you that don't give you free ticket anywhere either you can waste it i did for about 20 years i wasted all that knowledge but it was nothing but human knowledge sharon it was up here it wasn't down here i like that that's what it was it was all head knowledge it was all i knew what the what the what happened in the garden i knew that water baptism was right i knew i knew that but it never got down here but this right here true justification sanctification is right here right so i come to a realization then i come to sanctification just like you're gonna have to come to sanctification where the unclean spirit goes out of you okay remember we preached the sermon not too long ago on ezekiel where it talks about a new heart okay with that we got to go through that again right now let's go to number six i'll let brother branham explain it better than i can number six why some people can't keep the victory in 1957 yes that's what we need today is the experience of the new birth now i want you to watch the order that ezekiel brought it he said i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you now how many is that three three processes of grace ezekiel taught it before anybody else did i'll give you a new spirit and put my spirit in your heart i want you to watch there's three of it a new heart i'll take the old stony heart away what the old nature and start working on it that's the old different heart you have and i'll give you a new spirit now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people that thought sometimes that that new spirit was the holy spirit that's why you have to be careful in sanctification that unclean spirit will go out and you'll feel good you'll start feeling what religious not christian you'll feel religious right i did feel religious but something's got to come back in to make you the christian all right i want everybody to see this i want everybody i'm kind of like uh saint martin was i want to know everybody in this church has got the new birth amen that's my desire that everybody not that i know it that you know it right right because if you if you know it and you got it i'll know it because you'll act like it right all right now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people who thought sometimes that a new spirit was the holy spirit because remember sanctification brother brown teaches on further in sanctification that you become part of a religious order right so you become religious you become part of a religious order but you can stay in that religion and die and go to hell right never go up the statue of a perfect man right all right now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people thought sometimes that the new spirit was the holy spirit because you know what that new spirit it makes you want to go to church it makes you want to read your bible it makes you want to do because it's a new spirit okay it's a new one that you've never had before but it isn't it's a new spirit god gives you a new why you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old spirit yeah how you going to get along with the holy ghost god had to give you a new spirit so you could get along with his spirit right and sometimes people a new heart a new heart of flesh so you'll receive it then a new spirit in that heart and then i'll put my spirit in that you see i'll explain it to man just hang on new heart new spirit my spirit three things he spoke up justification sanctification baptism holy ghost works the same way all right now many times we try to make that thing just say well as soon as you get the new spirit you quit your stealing you quit your line things like that you say oh hallelujah i got it and you find out the first time anyone crosses your path or a little bit oh mercy what a difference sure you blow up like a frog eating buckshot but let me tell you brother that's the reason you never got god's spirit that's true oh you say he stepped on my toe i'll just not put up with that all right that shows what you got in you that's true i'll put a new spirit in you and then i'll put my spirit in you now right here watch this now the heart is in the center of the emotions of the human being right anybody see that now the heart not not your not the thumping part your heart the the very person of the center of you is the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so god puts a new heart in the middle of the old man then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit three rings then he puts a new spirit in the middle a new spirit in the middle he puts a new spirit in the middle of a new spirit our heart and puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit right one more time you confused now your heart is the middle of you so god puts a new heart in the middle of the old man then he puts a new spirit in the middle it puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit remember sanctification and he puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit right so see you can have this new spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell right right right brother brown said you can have beef you can have the holy he didn't say you have the new birth no he said you can have the holy ghost anointing your spirit every day of your life and dying go to hell well that's right here but if he ever puts his spirit in the middle of that new spirit you're born again right you're done because his spirit not your spirit or not another spirit he puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit you're born again now you're a child of god now you can grow in god now you're just beginning you're being born again amen all right everybody got that saying man amen all right now let's read number seven we'll make a few comments we'll honestly i kind of enjoy this because at least i can finish up next sunday or the next day the unfailing realities of a living god because you know if you if you're one certain if you preach just one sermon you gotta have a punchline you gotta raise it to a crescendo you know how the they got to come up you know to where the but when you when you're when you've got several days to do it or several sermons to do it you really don't have to just give you some thoughts for next week so you can think on them now look i want you to watch this the unfailing reality is the living god in 1960. brother braham said now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another right it will make each person come into its character because it's the spirit that leads you it brings makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature and the holy spirit makes you live and love to do it not just do's and don'ts that takes do's and don'ts out right there it makes you live and love to do it oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the holy spirit comes in how it cleans you and washes you and puts a desire in you to to to follow him and a thirst and a hunger for more of it amen for more of it just bathing yourself he brings realities amen man there's more to it than just getting born again sure you get it all when you believe but you don't know what you got you just don't know what you got that's right is that simple enough to explain it that way you you get the holy ghost you get everything you need you got everything you need for your body change you just don't understand it right you just don't know how to get to it yet just same way with that boy back there the the um i had his name and i just forgot it but anyway he's got everything he needs to drive the car all the faculties he's just not mature enough to do it he hasn't understood yet what he's got exactly right right same way with you and i we've we've got the holy ghost it's like i said we've got the power if you've got the holy ghost you've got eternal life in your soul but god just doesn't want that to happen he wants to take what's in there and move it out where to go out let's read this next quote right here number eight if god be with us then where's all the miracle someone said to me one time i know the doctor was talking about a miracle that happened among a sick person he said to me preacher don't you believe if you told them people to go out and touch a tree or a post the same thing would take place i said no sir i said because you cannot have faith in touching a tree or a post faith is not that loose it's got to be based upon some noted fact you've got to know something about what you are having faith in before you can drive the car before you can have faith in it so we first must know how and what right what god's desire is what god's plan is and how to approach god by that plan and then we can walk up boldly to the throne of grace and plead what the plan is promised us everybody got that amen you cannot have faith in touching a tree or a post faith is not that loose it's got to be based on some noted fact so there's where we put the foundation of our faith on what the word of god says not just the letter of the word the revelation because remember faith is a revelation right all right let's let's go to number nine is your life worthy of the gospel 1963 when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that god says in his word for you to do that pretty plain and everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day or night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you certainly above everything bear the fruits of the spirit so you're bearing the fruits of the spirit even as you go along you say well i speak with tongues you might do that and you might not will i shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you'll bear the fruit of the spirit glory fruit of the spirit is love joy peace faith long suffering meekness gentleness patience your temper will not be old just remember when you get that that poisons the holy spirit away from you see when you temp your temper will not be oh just remember when you get to that that poisons the holy spirit away from you see when you get to a place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along with there's something wrong we get a place where a minister will read from the bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing and you'll just remember there's no christianity there at all that's now that's now that by their fruits you shall know them that's what jesus said see roll it on up it's the word and god said so that spirit in you will cope with that word every time because genuine holy spirit will cope with the word because the word is life and spirit now let me stop here for a moment he's not saying you'll understand every bit of it just like driving the car you won't understand it you got to be taught all right but it's there if you've got the holy spirit and you hear that word you'll not be contrary to it right you can't because look how can the word deny the word exactly right if you've got eternal life and he is the word how can the word deny the word what kind of a person would you make god that's one thing to know that you're a christian and when you come fully when you can fully agree upon every word of god amen you might say i don't understand that part but you'll never read that bible and say well i don't believe that right right i mean if you look at this bible and say well i don't believe he said that then you're an unbeliever right you're an unbelief that you make yourself an unbeliever but you can read the word of god like we all do and say well now i really don't understand that yeah i put a comma yeah because if it's in the word and you got the holy ghost somewhere along the line he's going to reveal it to you he's got to all right let's finish this let's go to christ the mystery guard reveal now this is after the seals this is one of the great messages that he preached and he preached it mainly on the new birth because christ is the mystery of god reveal but remember it's not just christ it's christ in you is the mystery the mystery of this world is is that god is now living in a group of people and we're hid from the world right amen the world will not see me anymore but you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world right so who's going to see him only the people that are in that faith are going to be able to see truly see what god is and where he is you know the denomination says well we think this and we think that no we know where he's at right he's in the word of god look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you which is what the word christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god's trying to do what is the new birth then you say well brother branham what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally right to you amen the revelation of who that man is personally to you not a revelation of who the prophet is not a revelation who brother daley is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you like i've said many times before and i hope you don't get this wrong i'm going to say it again when we start talking about that city it's 1500 miles square right that's the law that's a long way that city is a pretty big city that's where that's where the bride lives right that's where the chosen elected lady that's where his wife is going to live right the whole bride of jesus christ is going to live in that city the blood washed the eternal all the glorious things that we get but 99 of them percent of them people is never going to hear about william branham or have never heard of william branham are the message of the hour you understand what i'm saying what i'm saying i'm not not belittling the message what i'm saying is brother brown come to turn us back to that man right there not the revelation of william branham see a lot of people get some revelation to william branham you got to get a revelation of jesus christ and that will turn you see what is malachi 4 to do turn the heart of the children to the fathers that's what the prophet of god did he turned us he showed us really where christ was not somewhere over there what did moses do he said god's not over there he's not over here he's in he's right here right not you joined a church you shook a hand or done something different you set a creed you promised to live by a code of rules see that's the message that's the old message live by a coat of rules your dress has got to be four inches but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says now see this is the part you got to hold on to because that's your foundation we'll talk a little bit about that next sunday but your foundation is you got to believe beyond anything else right you got to believe no matter what anybody says what takes place is christ right pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was what built upon so what what is this built upon the foundation the foundation is that you have got to believe faith you got to believe in something right you say well i'm lutheran i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian that don't mean one don't mean brother brown snaps his fingers that don't mean one thing to god not a thing not a snap of your finger what is it it's christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it doesn't just it's not just revealed it expresses itself it comes out it expresses itself see that's god's purpose for jesus christ was to express himself that was god's purpose to express himself so that we can understand a god that can't be understood how can you understand a god that created something from nothing how can you understand a god that before the eternal he was eternal right how can you understand that you can't but when he come down condescended itself to jesus christ i can understand that right and i can understand the one that created the world lived in that amen and that was my savior that god came see so now he's condescended so that we can see that great god's purpose for jesus christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws cun and fulfill his law by death and christ god died in the flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of god and not swap it like eve did for intellectual conception of man you see it that's christ's idea right that's god's idea the new birth reveals this which is what christ in you the hope of glory all right let's go to one more and then we'll stop right here paradox 1963. that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it now this message was preached right after christ the mystery god revealed was preached because it was preached on seven in july this was the first of august so he's still continuing his same thought the that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people right they can't understand it they don't know what you mean they have belittled it amen watch this that same devil's working today right in the message of the hour they have belittled it bring it down saying well just because you believe something the devils believe the same thing in tremble it isn't what you believe it's what god has actually done the new birth is a birth it was a new it was a paradox when god brought new life to the human race to reject it as eternal separation to receive in his eternal life you're on the look you're on the same basis as adam and eve was that's right you can take if god puts you on anything else it would be unjust adam and eve so remember because he's the greatest judge there is he's the only eternal perfect judge we can judge on earth and make mistakes god can't judge and make mistakes it would be unjust to adam and eve each adam and eve tonight has got the right and wrong setting before them you can make your choice you can take god's word or leave god's word it's up to me and you right you can take it or you can leave it right but the new birth is a mystery glory so the statue of a perfect man has to be a mystery sure it has to be a mystery people cannot understand it because it's a mystery but um let me hit this real strong if you're not born again you're not going to understand it right right you're going to try your best to live as close as you can to it but it's just like brother brown said the the black bird trying to stick peacock feathers into his into his body somewhere you're going to shake him off and you're going to be still be the black bird all right so the basis of this whole thing that all today is is faith is the new birth glory so faith has to be something that you believe in not just something you believe in you got to believe that god glory did what he did for you amen not for richard marlowe not for danny fountain he did it for me he didn't die for them he died for me sorry well you got to say he died for you not me because you know what you don't know that he died for me i know sure we know he died for all of us but i'm talking about the culmination of it the culmination to get into this right here there's a lot of there's a lot of people comes right here and don't have enough faith to get the new birth right right right that's wrong they've come right here at sanctification and don't have enough faith to get the new birth see let's just explain it like this this is the wise virgin this is the foolish virgin right right this is the wise virgin because they have oil oil is a type of the holy ghost right but now listen to this though where does the foolish virgins go to to try to get the oil right right they try to go to the ones that's got the oil so they're going to try to come you know you can't go get gasoline i mean you can't go yeah you can't go get gasoline at a water station or you can't go get water at a gasoline station you understand what i'm saying they have to come they know they need the oil right but what do they say they say we only have enough for ourself because really you're only going to have enough to get yourself through you you're not going to have enough for even for your wife or your children or your family you're going to have to have enough for you to get in now they can come to you for the oil but what if the oil's not there right right what if the oil is not there for them to get it right like brother brown said about a bounce check he said somebody goes and writes a check got no money in the bank what does it do comes back insufficient funds let me leave you with that thought because as we go up this statue of perfect man the first one is virtue virtue is what strength right you've got to have it to be able to draw from it you can't acquire it somebody need it and then you'd say well i got to go get it no it's got to be something that's birthed in you each one of these let's stand each one of these is a birth all right this each one this is being we'll read it next sunday you know what peter the same one and said you got to be born again to get into this same peter said being born again by what the incorruptible word of god that liveth in the body forever right so i want you to think about that till next sunday these virtues are a birth right they are not just well i need to have it well i think i'll get it no it's a birth it's a birth of what the word i believe it's the birth of the word you hold on to because i don't i i i don't think that uh who was that said this morning somebody said brother al brother al said i ha i'm gonna have to listen to this four or five times he said cause i'm not gonna get it all at one time and he's right out of this one hour and 10 minute sermon you're probably gonna get 15 minutes of information that you might take back and apply it to your life or think about it till next week that's why we've been around for 50 years really that's why we've been around for 50 years we're only getting a little bit at a time but i hope you get enough a little bit of the time to carry you on to carry you on in the revelation of god not a revelation that i got a revelation you've got to have a revelation that you've got a revelation amen it's got to be personally to you i want us to have a personal relationship with god i believe sometimes our relationship comes well brother branham was a prophet brother dale is the preacher or the the pastor and and brother bob's a sunday school teacher and i got it all from them well yeah you'll get it from them but it's not just because they got it right that you got it right right not just because they got it you got to get it yourself amen you got to get yourself in the family you got to be involved i want i want everybody to have the new birth cause you know what it changes it'll change your life i'll be quiet go ahead oh you want to sing something yeah let's sing something let's try it let's try that 67 in in the spiral book spiral book 67 in the spiral book didn't mean to put you on the spot over there sorry i thought right out of the line no you're doing fine no i do get out of line from bethlehem came forth a stranger it says in earth not on earth in earth let's do that let's be like him to be like blind him is i and holy by grace to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like him all through life's journey my faith in the name of jesus christ to be like jesus in earth is he's your it's a desire in our brother's heart for this to be done lord and you told us that you would give us the desire of our heart we ask these things in the name of jesus christ that we believe amen amen you already confessed it that's all you got to do and it'll accomplish everything that they're supposed to accomplish in the name of jesus christ to be like in the name of jesus christ give her the desire of our heart that everything will work out for your honor and glory lord and not for each one of us but for you lord she's already confessed it and we believe it in the name of jesus christ let it be done amen holy and jesus this morning for your home come and get them or either at your work you know there's one thing i want us to understand through all this there's a point in time where we all come to a place to where when we first started you know with the lord it was it was wonderful and then all of a sudden you know you thought maybe god took a vacation and you can't find him nowhere who all went through that okay but he's still there he just wants us to grow up not be children not cry daddy daddy anymore the times that we we lay hands on the sick that's fine but you know there's a lot of times you watch brother branham and you watch jesus and we're that's our example right you watch them you watch brother branham in the prayer line and you watch jesus in prayer line or talking to a demon he don't scream the demon's not deaf and god's not deaf sure what the problem is though what many times we try to get that emotion built up to where you get the people's faith built up which is fine that's okay but now it comes a time to where you start talking to devils you don't have to scream at him going to stay right there until the life of god right tells him to leave remember the the legion jesus never laid hands on any of them people actually the devil said can we go they don't even want to stand around close by the devil the devil said jesus why did you come here before our time what are you doing here you let us leave and you know what he said go he didn't scream shout you know beat him on the head he said go and they said please can we go into these you know into these animals over here you know they were actually in subjection to the god that was standing in front of them when you come up for prayer when you break the sound wave when you speak and you and you confess something believe that it's already done then sometimes what we do is we come up here and that's okay but we come up here and we ask something and then you want the preacher to pray then you want god to do it you know then you want the manifestation of it remember god does it then he reveals it right the last thing is he makes it manifest but he already does it when you open your mouth and you make that confession of what you need doesn't matter who it's for for you or somebody else but you make that confession right then believe that before a preacher prays for you anoints you with oil or anything believe right then that god heard you first he heard you before the foundation of the world but see you've got to come up and make a confession and once you make that confession you watch brother branham he'll come up he'll say you've got a demon and then he'll start going back and picking their life out and finding out where that demon remember the woman that that was in the insane asylum he said you could have poured 55 gallons of oil on that woman's head and that devil would have stayed right there i know the bible says and we should anoint with oil pray the prayer of faith but you know you remember what brother brown did one time to cast out the devil he said the lord's prayer remember that our father who art in heaven hallowed the devil left in me and we didn't have to raise anything up he just quoted the word right thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth that is in heaven the devil knew then he was right there in earth so that devil just had to leave he'd have to scream at him so we don't have to scream at the devil but remember it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble amen it's the life behind the name so what i'm trying to get us to see is the life that we live it's what the devil's looking at remember he's very spiritual he knows whether you got it or not he knows whether you got it or not even before you know whether you got it or not because remember he's right there behind the behind god so let's realize that when we come up for prayer believe it settled as you just brother brown said just walking up to the altar defeats the devil getting out of bed in the morning and put your feet on the floor all the hell breaks loose oh god a born again believers then got up out of the bed again well you know what you didn't have to go you didn't have to shout at no demon they know where you're at right right they know where my house is if they not don't know where yours at they'll soon find it but you got to take this and believe that god's already done it it's already done even this is already finished but we got to go through the process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to get into that body to where we can you know what i i love brother dick but he's not my daddy brother dick's got a will right you got a brother that's got a will he is i'm not in his will because i'm not his son i'd like to be but i'm not maybe sister gayle's not his i'm being sister gayle i'll be a sister gayle as will but the reason i'm not though is is why i'm not a part of that family oh she might will me something cause she likes me but no in in god though what is his will his will is his word he already wrote his will and if you're not in the family you don't get the promises that's in here you know what you don't deserve them i don't deserve brother dick's money because i didn't come from him or sister gail either one i sure probably would be rather with her but you understand what i'm saying natural things type spiritual things if you're a child of the devil you know what you don't get any of these benefits but if you're a child of god and god knows your heart he'll know whether you're going to make that or not but you do not know but you got to fight your way through it right you have gonna fight every day of your life this is not a picnic this is the battle right we didn't come with forks and spoons we come with knives and swords and that's what you got to do you got to fight your way through and fight your way through this week and come out wednesday night what are they supposed to listen to i was in the back and i didn't hear what you said questions and answers on genesis i think i know where that's going to but remember that that's a good one so remember that also read merit read uh statue of perfect man blasphemous names for next sunday i hope you're enjoying this i hope it helps everybody and i hope you can understand because i i want everybody to understand that if you're not born again this is not for you but you can be you say oh if i'm predestinated seed i'll come that's a whole sermon in itself but it's your free moral agency decides whether you get in or not amen your free moral agency let's buy our heads dear heavenly father we pray lord that you'd be with us as we leave grant the request of all these people lord that's come up your children your sons and daughters lord they've come lord with a petition to you father now it's been taken to the angels and the angels delivered to you father and now as their faith arises lord may you bring everything to pass that's been asked for even the things that's asked for in a congregation i know many times though there's been things in the congregation that people have asked for that didn't have to come up here lord that your word healed them and took care of them right there where they were sitting father we pray that you'll raise our faith up so that we can believe that we are the children of god not going to be or not could be but we are the children of an eternal living god bless us now father go with us may you break the bands that bind us with all this sickness and cold and flu may everyone come back to service lord and and be well and not have to worry about this old flu and all the things that are going around lord these prayer cloths have been given out now we have a ring of fire a wall of fire around us with nothing now to fear lord we ask you to take care of us now bless us as we go our way come back on wednesday night in service for you father in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed
