[0:02] all right
[0:04] everybody keep brother Bob in the prayer
[0:06] if he's preaching for uh
[0:08] Matthew Brown today so yeah and Tracy
[0:12] Cash's father died this morning oh no
[0:16] he just called us yesterday
[0:20] he's giving us a report on Daddy that he
[0:24] hadn't
[0:31] he said they told him it'd be about two
[0:34] months
[0:35] she died today
[0:44] I mean they you know a lot of people
[0:46] going home real bad shape and then the
[0:49] next there or two they're gone they're
[0:51] homicidal
[1:14] just like I said remember brother Bob
[1:17] he's keeping his Bible close handy he
[1:19] said
[1:20] oh remember him in your prayers let's
[1:22] turn to Hebrews 11.
[1:30] verse one now Faith is the substance of
[1:33] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:36] not seen for by it what faith the elders
[1:43] obtained a good report now they've
[1:44] obtained a good report but they didn't
[1:46] obtain profession
[1:49] they just believed
[1:52] they have faith for their time you say
[1:54] did they have Holy Ghost Faith yeah but
[1:56] they didn't have a new birth face
[1:59] we're going to talk about that maybe a
[2:00] little bit
[2:02] he said oh what's different well
[2:04] Luther had Faith didn't he
[2:07] he had faith and follow us on Holy Ghost
[2:12] right
[2:13] he had faith for his time that's right
[2:15] he had faith for what he could see
[2:17] that's right he believed that the just
[2:19] shall live by faith and God stabbed it
[2:21] and said that's it right there that's
[2:23] the faith I need right there at this
[2:25] moment I did I don't need
[2:28] remember
[2:30] I don't need the faith of one God or
[2:32] that right now that's God winked at the
[2:34] ignorance of man and the ignorance of
[2:38] people in denominations and things like
[2:41] that
[2:42] he wainted that but he had Faith yes
[2:45] faith for the time
[2:48] all right so these people had faith for
[2:50] the time
[2:52] Abraham had so much Faith he just
[2:54] believed God but he didn't have New
[2:57] Birth Faith because New Birth face
[3:00] in this hour takes you to the pure word
[3:03] of God nobody got that because in stages
[3:06] I didn't have the word and have the word
[3:09] to go with it they had part of it but
[3:11] they didn't have all of it okay so you
[3:13] that's what brother Brown said the
[3:15] little woman at the well had faith for
[3:16] what the time now she wasn't born again
[3:19] Christian but she had faith for the time
[3:21] and the woman at the well had faith for
[3:23] the time that she needed it
[3:26] all right Bob said all is well so just
[3:28] keep praying for him
[3:29] but look look what Abraham did Batman
[3:34] and he didn't have that much word
[3:37] yeah zero word really I mean he just had
[3:39] the word of God telling him straight to
[3:41] go do something
[3:42] that's why I do Abraham's the father of
[3:45] our faith
[3:46] he's the one that we're supposed to look
[3:48] to and say regardless of any
[3:50] circumstance I believe
[3:52] because he he looked he had plenty of
[3:54] circumstances but he just said okay God
[3:56] you said you was going to do it the
[3:57] problem with us is we say Okay God you
[3:59] said you're going to do it but I'm going
[4:00] to help you that's right that's our
[4:03] problem amen we say God I just lay it in
[4:07] your arms but now I'm going to help you
[4:08] a little bit tomorrow no I'm gonna
[4:10] figure this thing out for you yeah
[4:12] Abraham
[4:14] just got up and did everything God said
[4:19] he didn't I'm sure he laughed at one
[4:21] time that was a human man Abraham
[4:22] laughing at at something that he looked
[4:27] and saw impossible maybe for a split
[4:29] second in his Humanity but down deep
[4:32] inside he believed that what God Said
[4:33] was going to come to pass
[4:36] and he just walked and one day he walked
[4:38] right into what he saw
[4:40] he walked right into that and like club
[4:43] now we're talking a couple days ago
[4:45] we're talking about Abraham and
[4:46] Melchizedek the reason he could call him
[4:48] my Lord had already met him
[4:51] he met him on the road for the slaughter
[4:53] of the king
[4:54] right all right so he he saw the man
[4:57] Melchizedek
[4:59] right right then when he saw the three
[5:02] men coming he said my lord well that was
[5:05] the same man
[5:08] that told him said your name is now
[5:10] Abraham not Abram
[5:13] so he had he believed because he saw
[5:15] what happened in his journey he saw what
[5:17] happened in his life he saw what
[5:19] happened in the time that he was living
[5:22] that God was leading it and he just you
[5:24] know what he done he understood that it
[5:25] was God leading him I believe that's
[5:27] what Abraham he just understood
[5:29] God picked him God's one is going to do
[5:32] this God said I was going to have a baby
[5:34] so I'm just gonna have a baby and I'm
[5:36] not gonna sit all day and worry about me
[5:39] getting older and I'm not going to worry
[5:41] about me and Sarah not having relations
[5:43] with each other because it got worse and
[5:44] worse didn't get better better it got
[5:47] worse and worse but remember when he met
[5:50] God that was that was what Claude and I
[5:53] were talking about when he met God he
[5:54] knew it
[5:59] and then you got to know that you meet
[6:01] God well then he's going to call your
[6:02] name or change your name
[6:04] to Christian or change your name to
[6:07] adopted there's a lot of different
[6:09] things that you got to look at here in
[6:11] this age that they didn't have to look
[6:12] at Abraham didn't have to worry about
[6:14] being an adopted son of God
[6:17] because remember Abraham didn't do any
[6:19] miracles
[6:21] did he he didn't do a miracle one
[6:24] John the Baptist didn't do a miracle one
[6:28] but John was the greatest of the
[6:29] prophets and Abraham was the greatest of
[6:31] our faith yet not one miracle was done
[6:33] now God did a miracle to Abraham
[6:36] but Abraham physically didn't I mean not
[6:40] physically but spiritually he didn't
[6:41] raise up Lot's wife
[6:45] remember she turned into pill of assault
[6:47] but he went and got a lot
[6:49] he was he was looking after his brother
[6:51] and brother-in-law or cousin whatever it
[6:53] was he was looking after him right
[6:56] that's right but he never done a miracle
[6:58] in other words there was nothing done
[6:59] through his life
[7:01] that he called a squirrel into existence
[7:03] or that he called this one into
[7:06] existence or that went into existence he
[7:09] didn't have any of that show me the
[7:12] mirror show me the miracle
[7:14] now God did a miracle to Abraham in his
[7:16] whole life
[7:18] and we look back at Abraham and we see
[7:21] that it's a miracle
[7:23] every day that he walked that's right
[7:25] but he didn't see it I don't believe
[7:27] until he come to a place to where he
[7:29] woke up that morning
[7:31] and his body was changed that was the
[7:34] realization that now I can produce that
[7:37] child
[7:39] physically I'm talking about physically
[7:42] spiritually he produced it brother Brown
[7:44] said he started buying the booties in
[7:45] the bird eye 25 years later earlier
[7:47] spiritually he was ready for it
[7:51] see that's the way when you and I
[7:52] spiritually we may be ready for
[7:54] something that's right but now this part
[7:57] right here works on you say physical
[7:58] yeah it works on the physical part again
[8:00] because it's your spirit in your in your
[8:01] body your soul should be renamed your
[8:04] soul should be put into place but if
[8:06] your spirit and your body is is what's
[8:08] controlling
[8:09] and it is sorry your spirit and your
[8:12] body controls
[8:13] your soul 90 of the time that's right
[8:17] laughs
[8:18] that's right
[8:19] it controls you 90 of the time because
[8:22] we live in this world that's right we're
[8:25] not all hey if all y'all are living in
[8:27] in some spiritual realm 90 of the time I
[8:30] want to walk with you just for about a
[8:31] day
[8:33] we'll find out whether you are or not
[8:34] whether you think that's what that is or
[8:36] not you understand what I'm saying so
[8:38] let's just be real that's right
[8:40] that 10 of the time we walk in a realm
[8:43] of God 90 we walk in the realm of spirit
[8:46] and body because the body really does
[8:49] nothing but what the spirit tells it to
[8:50] do right if motive it's the motivator to
[8:53] tell the body what to do all right so
[8:55] we're dealing with the soul of man now
[8:58] we come to a place where brother Ram
[8:59] said the soul is born again we know that
[9:01] because Peter says we are sitting in
[9:03] Heavenly places where the Bible does in
[9:05] Christ Jesus and then Peter tells us
[9:08] says having Divine this divine nature
[9:10] add to that right
[9:12] in other words add to your faith right
[9:15] so faith is a revelation it's a
[9:17] substance it's something that you have
[9:19] now that's not like what Abraham had
[9:23] in the degree you hear me in the degree
[9:25] it's the same Holy Ghost but Abraham was
[9:28] not a cleansed Son of God
[9:32] sorry his soul was still black if it
[9:35] wasn't black he was a born-again Son of
[9:38] God and though we there's none of those
[9:39] in the New Testament Jesus had all that
[9:42] with him when he came here that's right
[9:44] Old Testament because Jesus the death of
[9:47] the testator that's why I had to be a
[9:48] new testament he said a new testament in
[9:50] my blood
[9:51] because he held that Holy Ghost
[9:54] right that's what he said he was I and
[9:58] my father are going to come back the
[9:59] comforter so he knew he was the Holy
[10:01] Ghost but he had it all bottled up
[10:03] inside of it
[10:05] and then he had to release that life
[10:07] when he died that's why Christ had to
[10:10] come now when he come and released that
[10:12] life he brought Abraham in all those Old
[10:14] Testament Saints because they had faith
[10:17] good faith for their time because I want
[10:20] you to read now look at all these people
[10:22] that have just tremendous Faith all
[10:25] right but look over here go to the verse
[10:28] 38.
[10:31] this is explaining of whom the world was
[10:35] not even worthy for them to be here
[10:38] that's how great God thought of them
[10:40] what all these people in the Old
[10:42] Testament
[10:43] get in Barack it tells you all of them
[10:45] Isaacs Abraham Moses Joseph
[10:49] you hear me
[10:50] but now watch verse 39. and these all
[10:55] having obtained a good report to Faith a
[10:57] good report
[10:58] receive not the promise
[11:01] now in my Bible I put an arrow close to
[11:04] buy close by it and I wrote New Birth
[11:06] because that's what it is they did not
[11:08] receive the new birth they are not
[11:11] or ever will be
[11:13] sons of God
[11:15] as far as a lineage of God
[11:19] everybody understand that say amen amen
[11:21] if not say oh man
[11:23] right you don't know
[11:29] but do you understand that because they
[11:31] can't have the Holy Ghost in their soul
[11:33] there was nothing to burn it out they
[11:35] were still under bulls and goats which
[11:37] covered it
[11:38] it covered their sin
[11:40] until Christ come to not just cover it
[11:43] but do away with it but they were
[11:44] already dead you can't see see how
[11:47] Catholicism can work here even if you
[11:49] even in the message of the hour
[11:52] the people it's a lot of people in a
[11:54] message I've had discussions well
[11:56] argument
[11:58] discussion argument whatever
[12:00] they said that that the people in the
[12:03] Old Testament had a new birth just like
[12:05] we did
[12:06] no way people no way the Bible says no I
[12:10] say no because of my confession and the
[12:12] way I see it and God says no he said
[12:15] right here receive not the promise
[12:18] I ain't gonna go past that
[12:22] well so yeah and even brother Brandon
[12:25] well even the Bible calls Abraham a
[12:27] friend of God no son of God
[12:30] right that's right
[12:32] when you said that like like art never
[12:34] will be friends nope never will be they
[12:38] will never be Sons and Daughters of God
[12:40] they never will be brave
[12:42] find me one quote where brother random
[12:45] called Abraham a Son of God I don't
[12:47] think there's one find me one quote in
[12:49] the Bible where they said Abraham was a
[12:50] Son of God had not died so the people in
[12:54] the Old Testament could not have gotten
[12:56] the new birth or like like we did
[12:58] because Jesus hadn't died yet peace what
[13:01] peace what other words
[13:04] okay listen what happened was in the old
[13:07] in the in the Old Testament if you read
[13:10] back where it gives you the lineages
[13:13] it's in Luke or Matthew one of the two
[13:15] there was only one son of God in the Old
[13:18] Testament and that was hit
[13:19] Adam because Adam was imparted eternal
[13:23] life in the garden his soul was given
[13:26] eternal life in the Garden of Eden
[13:28] because you know why he was Christ right
[13:30] okay he was the one that was going to
[13:33] produce all the children down through
[13:35] time that were born the right way
[13:38] everybody understand that
[13:40] but what happened was Satan
[13:44] took the Beast
[13:46] saw the natural act could be produced so
[13:49] he just blocks it well from then on God
[13:52] cannot bring anything clean through
[13:54] something unclean
[13:56] so Eve's womb was polluted that's why
[13:58] the serpent sea is not just sex it's
[14:01] everything that is involved in this
[14:04] message
[14:08] absolutely he gave him that and Eve was
[14:12] inside of them so she got it too yeah
[14:16] okay so that was the only way that God
[14:19] was going to bring me and you Sons and
[14:22] Daughters of God
[14:24] kids lineage Offspring that's the way we
[14:27] were supposed to come but when Satan did
[14:30] what he did he didn't he didn't he
[14:32] didn't uh destroy the plan of God he
[14:35] just cut it off for a little while he
[14:37] just took where God couldn't go any
[14:38] further because remember God cursed the
[14:40] ground and that's where our bodies were
[14:42] God curse the ground so no further so
[14:46] what did he do he took that book The
[14:48] Prophet said he took the book what is
[14:49] the book the book of names of the
[14:51] Eternal
[14:53] not every name but the Eternal part of
[14:55] the book the Lamb's Book of Life
[14:57] Abraham I mean Adam was going to be able
[15:01] to produce that
[15:03] but when I stopped God took the book
[15:05] back
[15:06] titled D he took the book back so you
[15:09] and I couldn't be born that way
[15:11] and he held that book all the way till
[15:13] he was born a baby and who he was born a
[15:15] baby that Holy Ghost came in that baby
[15:17] called Jesus
[15:19] you didn't have to receive something to
[15:21] be God he was God that's right okay
[15:24] he wasn't he was another person
[15:27] I don't understand that but people in
[15:29] the message the same way they preach the
[15:31] same thing that Jesus was just a man
[15:33] until God indwelled him I don't know the
[15:36] Bible says he was born Emmanuel God With
[15:38] Us so I was born god with us so they're
[15:41] not a part of the adoption
[15:46] they're not going to be able to all of
[15:48] them live inside the city like daddy's
[15:50] been talking about
[15:51] you only got inside that City you got
[15:53] 144 000 units which is the 144 000
[15:57] that's going to give their life when we
[15:58] leave right and the bride that's it
[16:01] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all them
[16:03] may have a position somewhere because
[16:05] they're Patriarchs but the rest of these
[16:07] others
[16:09] even Moses
[16:10] gonna have to live outside the city he
[16:12] can't live inside that City because he's
[16:14] not
[16:15] family
[16:16] but the New Testament that's correct the
[16:20] New Testament you will but let's take in
[16:22] the Old Testament people in the Old
[16:24] Testament will not be living inside that
[16:26] City that future home is just for the
[16:30] bride and 144 000 period now they can
[16:32] come in but they got to go out
[16:34] they're gonna live outside the city and
[16:36] be eternal but when Moses died he did
[16:40] not have eternal life and his soul when
[16:41] Abraham died he did not have eternal
[16:43] life in his soul so that we're born
[16:45] again so to me that's very simple okay
[16:52] no you got the two cities right that's
[16:55] why I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do a thing
[16:57] and I'm gonna help they're going to help
[16:59] me do a PowerPoint presentation of what
[17:01] what's in the Millennium and what's in
[17:03] the future home because remember Daddy
[17:04] hit it kind of class he said there's
[17:06] certain things can be here that's not
[17:08] here well in the city down here in the
[17:11] Millennium yes the fifth seal Jew that's
[17:13] just going to be their natural City
[17:15] but now the future home is let me
[17:17] explain I can explain more yesterday the
[17:20] Millennium we're just there as
[17:22] bystanders
[17:23] just let's just do it humanly just plain
[17:26] you and I are going to the Ball Game and
[17:30] we're going to sit and stand spectacles
[17:35] the Millennium is only to the Jews it's
[17:38] promised to the Jews to have the son of
[17:42] David sent on the throne in a temple a
[17:45] city there's going to be a City built
[17:46] over there a physical City and
[17:49] somebody's going to build it
[17:50] everybody understand that yeah the Bible
[17:53] says they'll build houses and inhabit
[17:55] that's not future home
[17:57] totally separate
[17:59] John 14 is the future home Jesus said
[18:02] I'd go to prepare a place John didn't
[18:04] see the city coming down in people
[18:05] building it was already finished because
[18:08] that's where you and I are going to live
[18:10] see that's the difference
[18:12] no that fulfilled you from my
[18:14] understanding he's gonna have to live
[18:15] outside the city because he was given
[18:17] eternal life later on for something else
[18:20] to show
[18:21] the grace of God
[18:24] but but as far as I'm reading what
[18:26] brother Brown says 144 000 will be units
[18:28] to the bride servants attendance inside
[18:31] the city and you and I are the only
[18:32] people who's going to live in the city
[18:33] it was built the future home was built
[18:35] just for the bride that's what I was
[18:37] trying to say yesterday to brother Mark
[18:39] the the Millennium is not actually we
[18:42] have no connection to the Millennium at
[18:43] all
[18:46] we don't we come riding back in the
[18:49] millennium
[18:51] the Jews are building the Temple the
[18:53] Jews are doing the worship the Jews are
[18:54] doing this and somebody's going to live
[18:56] a thousand years we're already eternal
[19:00] we're not going to prove that the
[19:01] Thousand-Year curse is over
[19:03] we prove it here okay
[19:06] okay we prove it here
[19:09] because we are impart in eternal life in
[19:12] our soul part of God
[19:15] everybody got that everybody got that
[19:18] but they're not
[19:19] they have to be given eternal life
[19:23] as an impartation they're giving eternal
[19:25] life and they live in a millennium and
[19:27] there's going to be people living in a
[19:28] millennium that's not Eternal gotta be
[19:31] that Heathen that's raised up
[19:34] somehows gotta have the gospel preached
[19:36] to them somehow the even the Bible says
[19:38] the child will die 100 and you hear all
[19:40] that that's not future home that's a
[19:43] millennium
[19:45] because the future home when that
[19:47] thing's done is sealed it's finished
[19:49] when that City comes down see even in
[19:51] the Millennium you got the devil still
[19:53] around he's not up here where we are but
[19:55] he's around
[19:57] he's bounded he's bound but he's around
[19:59] he's alive
[20:02] his little imps or his little
[20:04] spirits
[20:06] are not going to affect us but they're
[20:08] going to be
[20:10] still alive
[20:12] because remember like Dan said it's
[20:14] doggie May dogs they're going to be
[20:15] raised up
[20:16] they're gonna make an army somehow and
[20:19] try to destroy it it's not going to
[20:21] happen
[20:22] right but in a future home
[20:24] you don't have none of that fighting and
[20:26] and building houses and no that's all
[20:30] done the future home then the future
[20:32] home turns and it's to the bride period
[20:35] and the 144 000 as the units to
[20:39] the city never understand that see so
[20:43] this really we have nothing to do with
[20:45] the Millennium we're just there as a
[20:47] spectator watching the ball game
[20:49] and The Spectator does not
[20:51] produce the outcome of the game we're
[20:54] just there to watch it we'll partake and
[20:56] enjoy though
[21:00] never mind
[21:03] yeah we're no we're gonna have some
[21:05] we're gonna have some things to
[21:08] to do but it's not going to be
[21:11] it's not going to be things pertaining
[21:12] to a thousand years because that's what
[21:14] millennium is is to prove that the sin
[21:17] curse is over so if somebody's got to
[21:18] live a thousand years well like I said
[21:20] before when me and you leave this earth
[21:22] when our bodies change and we're made
[21:24] Eternal here
[21:27] our thousand here is over
[21:31] we're in eternity if you'll go back and
[21:34] want and listen and or read the future
[21:36] home brother random explains it watch
[21:38] him
[21:39] see because the seventh day the seventh
[21:42] Church age goes all the way through the
[21:44] millennium now I know he said the church
[21:46] age is over but you watch him he said
[21:48] that seventh day day
[21:51] time goes all the way through the
[21:53] Millennium because we're still in time
[21:55] days and nights and days and nights and
[21:57] days and nights all over the world
[21:59] things are going to be growing there's
[22:01] going to be a lot of different stuff
[22:04] the wife said seven years
[22:06] absolutely
[22:10] but watch
[22:11] but they said well now brother around
[22:13] you run out of your tires
[22:16] remember when he was talking about the
[22:17] future home he said you run out of your
[22:19] times you only got seven sevens is 49.
[22:22] do you believe on a 50.
[22:24] he said no I have not and he went back
[22:26] to Leviticus
[22:29] 20 something I can't remember what it is
[22:31] now I've just read it just the other day
[22:33] somewhere in there remember it calls an
[22:37] eight day holy convocation
[22:40] on the eighth day which is not an eighth
[22:42] day of the week it's the first day so
[22:44] it's a big circle it's eternity
[22:46] seven days goes just like this
[22:50] but when you put the Eighth Day in
[22:53] it just keeps going like that there's
[22:55] not a night day of the week
[22:56] God always said you think brother Brown
[22:59] talked about the Beatles being spiritual
[23:01] what was one of their what was one of
[23:04] their songs back in the 60s eight days a
[23:07] week
[23:08] they picked up on that
[23:11] spirit and produced a song eight days a
[23:14] week
[23:15] now everybody will be singing it all day
[23:17] long
[23:20] Lord forgive us all
[23:26] but no you see that and just like Clark
[23:29] was talking about The Fifth Dimension
[23:31] singing The Age of Aquarius that's
[23:34] Spirit hey it's not just
[23:36] foreign
[23:40] they get a piece of it they don't get
[23:42] any of it as far as spirituality but
[23:44] what what did Satan do he just Twisted
[23:46] it just a little bit
[23:47] so the eighth day was the future home
[23:51] because when that City comes down and
[23:54] Revelation 21 that John saw
[23:57] everything's old
[23:59] remember brother Brown said Time and
[24:01] Eternity Blends together we're going to
[24:02] be in time right up till that future
[24:03] home comes down
[24:05] yeah it's gonna be in time just because
[24:08] we leave and go out here doesn't mean
[24:10] time no that's the old Sabbath day the
[24:12] Millennium is still in the seventh day
[24:14] when God rested that seventh day that's
[24:16] still seven days all the way to the
[24:19] white Throne judgment then when all the
[24:22] judgment is over then brother Brown said
[24:24] time will blend into eternity all right
[24:26] but see time Blends me into Eternity for
[24:29] us here
[24:30] right now you're living in the Eighth
[24:32] Day in your soul
[24:33] your body's still living in the seventh
[24:36] day
[24:37] is that too much for everybody but I
[24:39] mean it's simple for them for a lot
[24:40] that's been here forever Daddy's Chris
[24:42] on it for 30 years
[24:44] I just have one question about
[24:47] future home only the people who have
[24:50] received Christ the Messiah while they
[24:53] were living can that's correct cities
[24:59] but they accept the Messiah before they
[25:01] die that's correct but see they that
[25:04] these people in the Old Testament died
[25:08] they died with a good report see it said
[25:12] you know not changing the Bible said and
[25:14] these all haven't obtained a good report
[25:16] through faith
[25:18] so they had a good report when they died
[25:19] they believed in God
[25:22] and see they didn't get the seals and
[25:24] the plagues and the bowels and the okay
[25:27] what time for it right but what they
[25:31] believed what God said they believed it
[25:33] that's right you know it's like Trudy
[25:35] said what about Abraham Abraham didn't
[25:37] have a study book
[25:39] to go by and say okay like we're
[25:41] studying now how to live and how to do
[25:42] things right he didn't have one though
[25:44] he just lived his life
[25:46] he didn't have a library to go to
[25:49] or he couldn't press play
[25:51] and to be honest with you up until about
[25:54] 50 or 60 years ago nobody else did
[25:57] either I mean you had Bibles and study
[25:59] books but you didn't have the message or
[26:01] the hour to pull us in the right
[26:02] direction
[26:03] that's why then in verse 40 says God
[26:07] having provided some better thing for us
[26:10] what is that some better thing when you
[26:12] birth
[26:14] to be a son and daughter of God a total
[26:17] lineage of the Almighty
[26:20] when the Bible says follow me into
[26:21] regeneration what does regeneration mean
[26:23] you've heard me preach on it it's
[26:25] regening you
[26:26] you were gened by your parents you
[26:29] understand genetics you were gened by
[26:31] your parents I was Gene by Mom and Daddy
[26:34] this thing you see here but if I'm born
[26:36] again inside that was regime
[26:40] from above right that's why Jesus said
[26:42] you must be born from above right that's
[26:44] right what he was saying was he was
[26:46] saying you need to be redeemed because
[26:48] your genetics is going to kill you
[26:50] that's right
[26:51] your natural genetics we're going to the
[26:54] ground
[26:54] but if you've got spiritual genetics
[26:57] if the spirit of him that raised up
[26:58] Jesus from the dead dwell in you what is
[27:00] that that's the genetics of the almighty
[27:02] that's the genetics of God that's not a
[27:05] like substance
[27:09] the new birth is not a life substance of
[27:11] God that's right it is the substance of
[27:14] God faith is the substance of things old
[27:16] for that's right that's why when you
[27:18] read second Peter you've got to have the
[27:20] new birth first that new birth
[27:23] changes your thinking it regenerates or
[27:26] regains you into a way where you can
[27:28] understand what your family is talking
[27:30] about
[27:32] because Dad's your family member
[27:35] Rodeo any preacher Any teacher any
[27:37] Minister that's your family member
[27:39] and they're telling you the part that
[27:41] you don't know about your family they
[27:43] are telling you the part that you don't
[27:45] know about your family
[27:46] everybody got that it's pretty simple
[27:48] but it's the truth that's what he's
[27:50] doing and look at the population
[27:54] uh just what sister um
[27:57] Braden was there a while ago
[27:59] um we have an advantage that they did
[28:02] not have because they came before us we
[28:05] had the advantage to learn what they
[28:07] knew remember what I read last Sunday
[28:09] about they were given to us for examples
[28:12] to whom the ends of the world's come
[28:14] upon see we can look back to them and
[28:17] and look at the trail that they Blaze
[28:19] and see that Abraham made mistakes and
[28:21] Isaac made mistakes and Jacob made
[28:23] mistakes and all these other people made
[28:25] mistakes
[28:26] they characterize that with our life
[28:28] examples yeah
[28:31] but now remember you've got to bring it
[28:33] up higher too that Esther wasn't exact
[28:36] was not an example
[28:39] she was the person right
[28:42] when we got to the end of that into the
[28:44] scripture reading she had all power and
[28:47] authority
[28:50] where was the king his name wasn't even
[28:52] mentioned in the last chapter
[28:53] it was Astra Mordecai Aston Mordecai
[28:56] extra Mordecai so where did all that
[28:58] come well that comes like sister
[29:01] um
[29:01] Regina said that comes with the adoption
[29:03] that comes with
[29:05] real quick before we go we're never
[29:07] gonna get into these virtual games but
[29:10] look if we build faith we will yes if we
[29:13] build faith in who we are we'll get to
[29:16] adding the virtues let's get let's get
[29:18] Faith of where we are now
[29:20] all right so let me get my thought back
[29:23] what were we talking about adoption
[29:25] adoption
[29:27] all right adoption means Authority right
[29:30] that means that God has said okay you
[29:34] can handle it just like we were talking
[29:35] about Jonas he can he has everything he
[29:38] needs to grab a car even the dirty
[29:39] riches he has everything he needs to
[29:42] drive a car but what does he have he's
[29:45] not responsible enough
[29:47] so we as adults we as the father
[29:51] got it I'm giving you a good example me
[29:54] as the father I say he can't drive the
[29:57] car because I can't if I give him that
[30:01] responsibility he can't handle it all
[30:03] right Abraham Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[30:07] now they were son now he's a son he's a
[30:10] Canada
[30:12] he's a Canada yeah right okay
[30:16] but I'm not going to give him my full
[30:19] Authority yet he's still a son
[30:22] so being a son in the in the New
[30:25] Testament
[30:26] being babies in Christ
[30:28] that's what God does and even in the Old
[30:31] Testament he said hey what he's saying
[30:33] in the Old Testament he's saying just
[30:34] like this right here they have all
[30:36] obtained a good report through faith
[30:38] all right so that's what God was looking
[30:40] at they believed in God and that was it
[30:43] now God could not listen to me God could
[30:47] not
[30:48] give them the keys to the car
[30:52] yes because they were not they were
[30:54] irresponsible look at all the
[30:56] irresponsibility in the Old Testament
[30:58] David a man after God's Own Heart but he
[31:02] murdered his best friend
[31:04] now with the new birth he'd never done
[31:06] that that's true he commanded adultery
[31:10] with his best friend's wife that he had
[31:11] killed right
[31:12] and there was a lot of things that David
[31:14] did that you can't understand but if he
[31:16] had a new birth he wouldn't have done
[31:18] that so I see in the Bible two examples
[31:20] one example the way we're supposed to
[31:22] live and another example of people that
[31:25] had had that had God but they were not
[31:27] responsible enough to do what he said
[31:29] right
[31:30] but now in the New Testament that's what
[31:33] these virtues and all are for is to
[31:36] bring a group of people that's all ready
[31:39] a little bit responsible
[31:42] because we are in the family of God and
[31:44] now God's ready to say hey you can take
[31:46] more because
[31:48] I'm going to give you more there's more
[31:51] availability for you to have so I'm
[31:53] going to give you more
[31:54] okay
[31:56] all right so let's go it's time to go
[31:58] we'll pick this up next Sunday thank you
[32:10] whoa
