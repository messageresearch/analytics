[0:00] it's a good start thanks brother Donnie
[0:02] for being here at the duty last week
[0:08] right uh brother brother ain't your name
[0:15] he got six foot tall he'd get upstairs
[0:20] when he grown up he'd get up into it
[0:24] you gotta beat somebody like us right
[0:28] that's fine some people don't make you
[0:30] know
[0:32] but you do like to tell how you got your
[0:35] fire Death
[0:58] all right
[1:01] of course he probably would have been
[1:02] yeah
[1:05] I brought two thoughts together
[1:08] well those of you on the internet we've
[1:11] been talking about pecan before we
[1:12] turned this thing on but anyway
[1:14] Revelation chapter five which is going
[1:16] to read
[1:17] we're going to read a lot out of the
[1:19] seal book today just let brother Brown
[1:22] kind of
[1:24] quote back what we've been what we've
[1:25] been talking about and then we're going
[1:27] to move on
[1:28] all right
[1:30] what we're going to do next Sunday is
[1:32] we're going to read some today out of
[1:34] the seal book and next Sunday we're
[1:36] going to wrap it all up we're going to
[1:38] read the whole chapter just do kind of
[1:39] an overview and then we're going to move
[1:40] into the first deal so everybody read
[1:42] the first seal and bring your Shield up
[1:45] all right chapter five now I saw on the
[1:47] right hand of him that said on the
[1:48] throne of book written within and on the
[1:50] back side seal the seven seal and I saw
[1:52] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:54] voice to his worthy to open the book and
[1:56] loose the seals thereof and no man in
[1:58] heaven
[2:00] knowing Earth neither under the Earth
[2:03] that means in heaven alive and even dead
[2:07] right anybody was able to open the
[2:10] button either to look there on and I
[2:12] went much because no man would have been
[2:13] worthy to open and read the book neither
[2:15] will look their own one of the owners
[2:18] said unto me we've not behold the line
[2:20] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[2:22] have prevailed to open the book into
[2:24] loose the Seven Seals thereof and I'll
[2:26] be held in low in the midst of the
[2:27] throne and the four beats and in the
[2:29] midst of the elders now remember what
[2:30] the four beef
[2:31] there's you it's the bride John's there
[2:33] with all in full array
[2:37] and in the midst of the elders what's
[2:39] that 24 Elders which is the 12 apostles
[2:41] and twelve Prophets
[2:43] student lamb as it had been slain having
[2:45] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[2:47] seven spirits from God sent forth
[2:49] into all the Earth and he he came and
[2:52] took the book out of the right hand of
[2:54] him that set up on the throne
[2:56] and when he had taken the book The Four
[2:57] beast and 420 Elders fell down before
[2:59] the lamb having never one of them hearts
[3:02] and Golden Balls full of odors which are
[3:04] what prayers
[3:06] of the Saints and they sung a new song
[3:10] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[3:11] and to open the seals and they're up for
[3:13] now what slain and has redeemed us to
[3:15] God by thy blood
[3:16] redeem who he only can redeem human
[3:18] being
[3:19] right all right can't redeem angels
[3:22] Don't redeem angels He redeems people
[3:25] you don't redeem animals you understand
[3:28] but the animals will be redeemed I'm
[3:29] talking about these four B's and these
[3:31] four beasts are the four powers
[3:34] that's given to the bride to make it
[3:37] through in other words
[3:38] right and the seven spirits that lamb
[3:41] wasn't standing there and didn't look
[3:43] odd because he had seven horns and seven
[3:44] eyes
[3:45] we understand that the prophet told us
[3:47] that was to horn means power
[3:51] and eyes mean seers or prophets all
[3:54] right so there were seven
[3:55] Kingdom ages the power of God in all
[3:58] those seven churches and the Seven men
[4:01] that brought the message are the seers
[4:03] s-e-e-r-s that brought the message
[4:07] of God to see what it says which are the
[4:09] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[4:11] the Earth which is Spirit-filled men
[4:13] right
[4:15] and they sing a new song saying they are
[4:17] worthy to think the book and open the
[4:18] seals thereof or thou what slanted has
[4:20] redeemed us
[4:21] to God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[4:25] and tongue and people and nation and has
[4:27] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[4:31] and the prophet said if we are Kings and
[4:33] Priests we got to have something to
[4:34] Reign Over and we shall reign
[4:37] now Scofield uh the the original
[4:40] translation if you have a Schofield
[4:42] Bible will show you the original
[4:44] translation the Latin translation is we
[4:47] shall reign over
[4:49] the Earth uh the King James version is
[4:52] on the Earth all right I like the word
[4:54] Ober
[4:55] now that don't mean that we're supposed
[4:57] to be heading and high-minded remember
[5:00] but we are going to rule and Reign Over
[5:04] something
[5:05] and we got to rule and Reign Over this
[5:07] Earth before that you're looking at now
[5:09] before we rule and ran over the round
[5:11] ball that they call the Third Rock From
[5:12] the Sun and the Earth
[5:13] all right everybody understand that
[5:16] when I see the word Earth I do not think
[5:18] of
[5:20] the round ball right I think of the one
[5:23] that I'm standing in like the brother
[5:24] said yesterday and he made a good point
[5:27] he said it we he said we say that we're
[5:30] having all these problems and we're
[5:31] going to just quit everything and just
[5:33] go out in the woods and just sit there
[5:35] you know and and fast and and you know
[5:37] get away from all my problems and he
[5:39] said he said you took it with you right
[5:42] he said you're taking it with you when
[5:44] you go out there you know it's a little
[5:46] funny little statement he said he he
[5:47] said it was a man on an island living by
[5:49] himself and some people come to see this
[5:52] man and he had three buildings they said
[5:53] what's those three buildings a man says
[5:55] well so this is my house
[5:57] and says this is the church that I went
[5:59] to I built this church here we go then
[6:02] one man on the island he said well
[6:04] what's that church in the middle he said
[6:05] oh we got a split at that church and I'm
[6:07] going to that church
[6:11] good point
[6:13] I told a brother one time that took us
[6:16] from that church of churches split and
[6:17] asked him to come passion I told him
[6:19] personally you know me I can't keep my
[6:20] mouth shut I said you I said if you take
[6:22] the split part of the church you better
[6:24] preach that split out of that church are
[6:26] you going to have a problem well six
[6:28] months later he was gone that church had
[6:29] went back together so
[6:31] yeah didn't know if I want to do to say
[6:34] anything but
[6:36] some people want
[6:38] them after a church it doesn't matter if
[6:40] it's him and his wife so
[6:42] God will make a way for you gift don't
[6:44] worry about that that's right
[6:46] well here we have the book
[6:49] of Revelation chapter five
[6:52] the book was closed nobody had ever
[6:55] understood it to the degree now listen
[6:58] everybody understood it to the degree
[6:59] that God wanted people to understand it
[7:01] that's right the book had been the
[7:03] physical book had been open all for
[7:05] years
[7:06] you know physically open the book preach
[7:08] the word of God out of John Wesley
[7:10] Luther Columbus Martin all those people
[7:14] opened the real Bible you know the Bible
[7:17] and read out of it and and saved sold
[7:20] and got people into the kingdom of God
[7:21] that's why when I was Minister the other
[7:23] night I kept saying John was a
[7:25] born-again Believer for 60 years and he
[7:27] comes to Revelation 5 and he's got a
[7:29] problem
[7:30] it's not a problem in John stole
[7:33] John Soul saved the book was opened just
[7:36] far enough for John to get into the body
[7:39] but in God's eyes that wasn't enough
[7:43] that's like you know last and I had not
[7:45] listened to him to Sunday afternoon
[7:47] service I like to listen to it first
[7:49] sometime that's kind of something I like
[7:51] to do listen to Daddy I listen to the
[7:52] afternoon service first and then listen
[7:54] to them to the morning service the
[7:56] second and it's just something that I
[7:58] can understand him better on but uh he
[8:01] and I were talking going downstairs and
[8:02] I haven't said anything to him about it
[8:04] but I was thinking actually coming back
[8:05] from Brother Oakley Sunday
[8:07] if people don't understand brother Brown
[8:09] this is going to help you in this book
[8:11] right here
[8:12] and Daddy brought it out Sunday
[8:13] afternoon but it was I had not heard it
[8:15] and we got together suddenly went down
[8:17] and you know he kind of looked over at
[8:18] me like I was playing like something was
[8:20] going on you know but I told him I said
[8:22] you know I've been thinking I said all
[8:23] this that we say you know run around
[8:25] talks about the seed always being in and
[8:27] he says well you weren't born on any
[8:28] certain day and and then he said well
[8:30] your eternal life started at the altar
[8:32] well now he's not contrary
[8:35] but let me tell you what happened this
[8:37] is what I believe happened
[8:39] brother Brown
[8:41] was you know and and I've heard
[8:44] preachers go through the whole sermons
[8:45] about Jesus speaking in Rhema and Logan
[8:48] Rhema being just natural human language
[8:50] and then logos being God doing the
[8:52] speaking all right even a minister told
[8:54] Daddy not too long or he told me about
[8:56] daddy not too long ago brother Pinkston
[8:57] he said your daddy speaks a lot and and
[9:00] there's a compliment he said he speaks
[9:02] in logos he said you have to understand
[9:04] what he's saying right he said because
[9:06] he's speaking Dutch language versus
[9:08] human language right pretty good for a
[9:10] preacher say that right about somebody
[9:12] else
[9:14] but that's what brother Brandon was
[9:16] doing though
[9:17] now it's not that he was contrary to his
[9:19] self
[9:22] what was he doing
[9:24] brother random would say himself and I I
[9:27] listened to it not too long ago or the
[9:28] Reddit
[9:30] he said sometimes I don't even know what
[9:32] I say on the tape I have to go back and
[9:34] listen to it everybody says well that's
[9:35] a prayer line that's the whole thing
[9:36] because he said there's some things in
[9:38] there that I said that I don't know you
[9:39] know I don't well who was saying that
[9:41] right God was speaking that now in God's
[9:44] eyes
[9:46] in God's eyes you and I never sinned a
[9:49] day in our life
[9:50] that seed always was there it always was
[9:53] eternal
[9:54] God never saw us you understand me now
[9:57] the the the logos part never saw us lost
[10:01] we'd have to kill us
[10:03] so brother randomly speaking from God's
[10:06] eyes you never was born on any certain
[10:08] day you always was eternal there always
[10:11] was a seed of eternal life laying
[10:13] somewhere not inside your body but I
[10:15] believe it was in the word right because
[10:16] the word of God is what he spoke out of
[10:18] his mouth way back before the foundation
[10:19] of the world all right because the daddy
[10:22] read it Sunday afternoon he said you
[10:23] wasn't he said that seed was placed in
[10:25] you before the foundation of the world
[10:26] well where were you before the
[10:27] foundation where you were in the mind of
[10:28] God right right you were the actual
[10:31] logos or the speech that came out from
[10:33] God it said let there be light that's
[10:34] the way we can understand the Bible all
[10:36] right because we were there with the guy
[10:38] that wrote the Bible all right
[10:40] so you and I are the same way when we're
[10:42] listening to brother Brown and brother
[10:43] Brown was preaching and he's looking
[10:45] from God's view saying you always was
[10:47] eternal you never was born only a
[10:49] certain day now he wasn't looking at
[10:51] flesh people right
[10:53] he was way in the low Gospel of God's
[10:56] mind that's right
[10:58] telling you what God said about you
[11:03] but then he turned around and say you
[11:05] bunch of Sinners you're lost you're
[11:08] doomed and on the way to Hell which is
[11:09] true
[11:11] you were your eternal life then didn't
[11:13] start for you
[11:15] the person now her hair is human
[11:18] he's preaching to human beings now you
[11:20] are lost right you needed a savior
[11:23] that's right you needed Redemption
[11:26] okay but now to speak in the positive
[11:29] Mind Of God he can't say that you were
[11:31] lost that's right that's right that's
[11:33] right you always was eternal that's
[11:35] right right if you're born again that's
[11:38] right if you are Eternal I mean if you
[11:40] were born again this morning you have
[11:42] eternal life that person inside of you
[11:45] never sinned a day in his life never
[11:46] seen a bad word never had a bad thought
[11:48] that's right but
[11:49] brother Branham was a human right
[11:53] he had the same responsibility of his
[11:57] body as he was preaching to our body
[11:59] right
[12:00] God had to tell him William Branham
[12:03] you're a sinner you're lost he told us
[12:07] remember he said he was falling remember
[12:09] when he got shot he was falling he was
[12:11] dying you know
[12:12] brother Rhino or William Branham you're
[12:16] lost all right
[12:17] but see when he comes on on the on the
[12:20] Rapture message
[12:21] he come up to a place where he says I'm
[12:24] not the son of Charles another brown but
[12:25] remember he was still standing in human
[12:26] flesh just like Danny was bringing out
[12:28] Sunday afternoon and that's what I was
[12:29] kind of thinking about coming home
[12:30] Sunday not knowing what he was preaching
[12:33] but that's the way I see now that you
[12:36] can take a quote that brother round said
[12:37] here and then you can take the quote
[12:39] that looks totally opposite but it's not
[12:40] right he's speaking from the mind of God
[12:42] showing the very positive God's mind is
[12:45] never negative it's always positive
[12:46] right right but he had to see the
[12:49] negative
[12:51] because he came down and human flesh
[12:53] that's right and he physically had a
[12:56] physical
[12:57] um eyes with with meat on his skin human
[12:59] skin he saw
[13:01] mankind saw what we needed
[13:06] and it could be known I believe he was
[13:10] walking in the Garden of Eden
[13:13] in a supernatural body
[13:17] because remember people when we go there
[13:21] we're going to have a flesh body
[13:23] but it's not like this waste body
[13:25] right right it's redeemed
[13:28] okay so he was walking in a supernatural
[13:31] body because brother Brown said I hugged
[13:33] them people and they were in their
[13:34] theophonies he said they were in some
[13:36] kind of a body so Jesus I mean God Jesus
[13:39] you can say he was in that body talking
[13:40] to Adam and Eve
[13:42] because it was a it was a human form it
[13:45] was a human body
[13:46] okay
[13:49] sad that you always was eternal
[13:52] hey saying like you always was in town
[13:55] they don't go on and quote where brother
[13:57] Brandon said yeah you're born again
[14:00] right that if you're born again that
[14:03] eternal life you are you've got always
[14:05] one that's right that flesh was
[14:08] not true because if you don't then you
[14:10] really you do away with like like that
[14:13] said but you know Jesus doesn't have to
[14:15] die for you
[14:17] because you always was
[14:19] well now
[14:22] let's go a little deeper than that
[14:23] because it wasn't because he did die
[14:27] but remember one thing
[14:29] Jesus didn't die to give you an
[14:31] inheritance right
[14:34] exactly
[14:36] he died to make you realize you had an
[14:40] inheritance right
[14:43] so that eternal life you have always was
[14:45] eternal that's right
[14:48] the Redemption part comes from when he
[14:50] was born from your mama and daddy and
[14:52] God give you a permitted part
[14:55] to permit you to come to the Earth to be
[14:58] a human being to have a living Soul
[15:00] could not be born again because that
[15:03] stopped when we're going to read it when
[15:04] God had to take that book back from Adam
[15:07] Adam couldn't save nobody that's right
[15:10] he had to come himself that's why I say
[15:12] Genesis 3 15 shows the whole Bible
[15:15] the whole Plan of Redemption is in
[15:16] Genesis 3 15. see to the woman I've got
[15:19] to come nobody else can do it I got to
[15:20] do it and that's what it shows in
[15:21] Revelation 5. Revelation 5 against 3 15
[15:24] is the same thing
[15:26] because who comes to redeem Christ
[15:29] the bloody lamb that's what he was
[15:31] saying in Genesis 3 15. he said I've got
[15:33] to come down and die nobody else can do
[15:35] it there's no man ever going to be
[15:36] worthy Adam forfeited that so let's
[15:39] start reading hearing we'll get to that
[15:41] page 66 67 and I'll quote the paragraph
[15:46] all right
[15:47] paragraph
[15:50] 48.
[15:53] all right this is in the breach now
[15:54] paragraph 48. we're going to read a
[15:57] little bit today I don't want to I
[15:58] really didn't want to take that much
[15:59] time you'll have to stop me from
[16:01] preaching
[16:02] that's just the state of the teaching
[16:04] party yeah all right Sunday School
[16:06] okay
[16:08] the seven steel book seals the Seven
[16:11] Seals holds the mystery of the book
[16:13] until we can see what those Seven Seals
[16:16] has sealed in we're only presuming them
[16:18] things now remember he didn't know one
[16:20] thing about seal but he knew about
[16:22] Redemption
[16:24] because he was redeemed let me say again
[16:27] John was standing there watching what
[16:29] was going on being 60 years born again
[16:32] brother Branham standing right here in
[16:34] Revelation 5.
[16:36] probably 30 something years being born
[16:38] again I think he's born again when he
[16:40] was like 22 years old or something like
[16:42] that which would have put in about 1920
[16:45] or something 19 20 21 something like
[16:47] that he born in 1909
[16:49] let's just say 1933 just to add up
[16:52] everything 33 to 63 is how many that's
[16:54] 30 Years brother Brandon was born again
[16:57] believer for 30 years but he said if
[16:58] it's still if it's not open we're only
[17:00] presuming right so he said wow for 30
[17:03] Years brother Brown was presuming that's
[17:04] what people in the message say that for
[17:05] 30 years he kind of just floundered
[17:07] around and he said things wrong he said
[17:09] no go back to what I just said
[17:12] remember God is speaking to you through
[17:14] a prophet that's right he does not
[17:17] if he's a true prophet he does not speak
[17:19] his own mind amen but there is a time
[17:22] when even you have to understand it even
[17:24] in preaching there's times when you
[17:25] start preaching and there's some things
[17:27] that that that that I know Dad does and
[17:29] I do too we will start ministering and
[17:31] we're like I really don't know how this
[17:33] is going to end
[17:35] but boy God just brings up and they'll
[17:36] just take it right you know just take it
[17:38] right where you need to go to bring a
[17:39] climax to the service you know and you
[17:41] haven't got a clue about it well that's
[17:42] God coming and bringing it to you all
[17:44] right same over brother Brandon but he
[17:46] had a more he was a prophet
[17:49] so God made that man where he could
[17:51] literally speak through his through his
[17:53] own lips and just literally take his
[17:55] mind out of the way and put God's mind
[17:57] in there and he's speaking to you and I
[17:58] speaking about that down inside man
[18:00] that's right
[18:02] but then you got brother Brown the human
[18:03] preaching
[18:04] now here we go I'm not I'm I'm I've
[18:07] heard people preach for hours trying to
[18:09] separate what they said I just like to
[18:12] say it was all God that's right there
[18:14] was just a human side of God talking to
[18:16] us and then the logos side of God
[18:18] talking to us
[18:21] you know what one thing's for sure he
[18:23] was not speaking to a lot of them people
[18:25] in front of him what he was saying
[18:27] it was for a future generation that
[18:29] generation is here now
[18:31] he was speaking to you and I not to
[18:34] those people back there not to say
[18:35] they're not born again not to say
[18:37] they're not filled with the Holy Ghost
[18:38] not to say some of them even come up to
[18:39] stack you a perfect man but to say one
[18:41] thing's for sure they never got the
[18:43] Capstone of this message until this day
[18:45] and time right here until the ministers
[18:47] because see the Bible doesn't say that
[18:48] the prophet one Prophet was for the
[18:50] perfecting of the Saints he said a
[18:52] five-fold Ministry so brother Brown had
[18:54] to give it to a five-fold minister right
[18:56] let them break it down because it didn't
[18:58] say that a prophet will perfect the
[19:00] Saints it said the file form Ministry
[19:02] was given to you to perfect to perfect
[19:05] you yes okay because really a prophet
[19:07] can't perfect you a prophet can deal
[19:10] okay but he brings Grace that's right he
[19:13] brings Grace but remember brother Brown
[19:15] said each one of those Messengers as
[19:16] soon as they hit the earth he said a
[19:18] plague followed on the earth what if you
[19:20] accepted this it's Grace if you reject
[19:22] it it's judgment that's right so let's
[19:24] read we're not going to get finished
[19:30] we're only presuming these things
[19:31] because I've told you this morning upon
[19:33] the little message this morning of God
[19:34] hiding excuse me in Simplicity you see
[19:37] we are we are sure to miss the thing
[19:39] unless it's absolutely genuinely
[19:41] revealed by the Holy Spirit
[19:43] and he didn't stop there he said and
[19:46] Vindicated the same all right
[19:50] if the prophet Rises and tells you that
[19:52] this is that this is just that and God
[19:55] don't vindicate the same forget it but
[19:58] God in every statement and everything
[20:00] has to be indicated to make it right his
[20:02] children will watch those things see and
[20:04] be alert notice
[20:06] set was sealed on the book has those
[20:08] Seven Seals has the book sealed the book
[20:11] is absolutely sealed
[20:13] all right the book is absolutely a
[20:16] sealed book until the seven sealed was
[20:18] broken it is sealed up with Seven Seals
[20:20] now that's a different from the seven
[20:21] Thunders see this is Seven Seals on the
[20:24] book
[20:25] all right just going down we're
[20:26] presuming but the genuine revelation of
[20:28] God will be made perfect in that
[20:30] sounding
[20:31] Vindicated truth paragraph 50. and this
[20:34] seven seal book remember it was closed
[20:36] here in Revelations 5 and in Revelations
[20:38] 10 it is open
[20:40] and now we're going to see what the book
[20:42] says about how it became open
[20:45] and it's not made known until the lamb
[20:47] takes the book and breaks the seals and
[20:49] opens the book see the lamb has got to
[20:51] take the book brother Brown had preached
[20:53] to a point where he could bring that
[20:55] Lamb on the scene in his life
[20:57] same thing's got to happen to you and I
[21:00] paragraph 52. it's hid now remember no
[21:03] man in heaven no man on Earth Pope
[21:05] Bishop cardinal state presbyter or
[21:07] whoever he is can break those SEALS or
[21:10] reveal the book but the lamb
[21:12] and we have probed and presumed and
[21:15] stumbled and wondered
[21:16] and that's the reason we're all in such
[21:18] a confusion
[21:20] still
[21:22] I put that in there for those on the
[21:24] tape
[21:24] but when the Divine promise that this
[21:27] book of redemption will be perfectly
[21:29] opened by the lamb and the seals thereof
[21:31] will be loosed by the lamb in the last
[21:33] days in which we're living now
[21:35] and is not made known until the lamb
[21:37] takes the book and breaks the seed
[21:39] because remember the book was being
[21:41] holded in the hands of him that sat upon
[21:44] the throne and the lamb comes to him and
[21:47] him that sits upon the throne and takes
[21:49] that book out of his right hand takes
[21:51] the book oh that's deep we'll try to
[21:53] solve it out if we can by the help of
[21:55] the Holy Spirit and we're depending on
[21:56] him and we'll see later
[21:58] it is at the end time no denomination
[22:01] has a right for interpretation of the
[22:03] book no man has the right to interpret
[22:04] it it is the Lamb who interprets it and
[22:07] the lamb is the one who speaks it and
[22:08] the lamb makes the word be known by
[22:10] vindicating and bringing the word to
[22:12] life
[22:13] paragraph 55 this book is not revealed
[22:15] until the churches and denominational
[22:17] ages has run out and there is time no
[22:19] more now here's where a lot of people
[22:21] think that brother Brown was talking
[22:23] about him coming back and having to
[22:24] reveal
[22:25] the seal that they're
[22:28] still closed I had a brother called me
[22:30] from a certain place not too long ago
[22:32] didn't even tell June about it but uh
[22:35] that a certain brother was on Facebook
[22:36] blasting this church because of our
[22:39] stand on the seventh seal
[22:40] and
[22:42] anything on Facebook to me is rotten
[22:44] anyway so he's got to get on Facebook
[22:46] rant raving he's got a problem
[22:49] so and he can get into trouble
[22:52] and you know I don't want nothing to
[22:55] happen to him but
[22:56] bless his heart if you can't see it but
[22:58] he thinks brother Brown's got to come
[22:59] back and reveal them
[23:01] the seven seal okay just because of some
[23:04] of these statements he says if you read
[23:06] this and if you read this in regular
[23:07] reading all right we're in the seventh
[23:09] Church age right
[23:11] right okay this book is not revealed
[23:14] until the church ages and denominational
[23:17] ages has run out
[23:21] and there is time no more
[23:24] now we're going to be in a layout of
[23:27] seeing time age until the Rapture takes
[23:28] place
[23:30] so their point is is then when the you
[23:33] know right at the resurrection brother
[23:34] Reynolds got to resurrect and
[23:36] teach us what the Seven Seals are and
[23:38] that's going to change our body and then
[23:40] blah blah blah
[23:42] but I thought the dead in Christ
[23:45] has to come out of the ground when the
[23:47] Resurrection trumpet sounds and it's got
[23:49] to be a live group of people to do it
[23:52] and brother Branham is now a part of
[23:53] that group
[23:54] he was prophesying
[23:57] okay he was prophesying
[24:00] see it it only revealed after church
[24:03] Asian denominate denominational ages has
[24:06] run out that's the reason the thing is
[24:08] in such a scruple tonight see they pick
[24:10] up a little Doctrine and run off here to
[24:12] one side and say this is it another one
[24:14] picks up another Doctrine runs offices
[24:16] this is it and each one builds a
[24:17] denominational and denomination hundred
[24:19] until we've got hundreds of
[24:21] denominations and I wrote in my book in
[24:23] this message
[24:25] but still in all of it to see the
[24:27] confusion the people are wondering what
[24:29] is true if that isn't just a condition
[24:31] today
[24:32] but then he promises
[24:34] that when that when that time has
[24:37] finished out there will be the sounding
[24:39] of the seventh Angels voice and when the
[24:41] book will be revealed see at that time
[24:43] see
[24:46] brother Brown knows as a human being
[24:48] he's in time
[24:50] but he's looking I think
[24:53] she said right here saying I don't he
[24:54] picked up somebody's thought he said
[24:56] don't say nobody them people ain't saved
[24:59] back now
[25:00] if they don't say they ain't safe
[25:01] they're safe thinking about filled with
[25:03] the Holy Ghost just like you are
[25:07] but their body is dead
[25:10] and needs a change from where it is if
[25:12] not it will continue to stay in that
[25:14] grave
[25:15] all right
[25:17] but the Mysteries that they couldn't
[25:18] understand
[25:20] so I can tell you today if you're born
[25:23] again you're caught out of the age so
[25:25] that you're not in an age right
[25:27] you're not in a denominational age I
[25:29] hope you might have some denominational
[25:30] ideas in yourself that you need to get
[25:32] out of but that's in self that's not
[25:34] insult right okay everybody understand
[25:37] that I can really I can and it's hard to
[25:41] say but you say pick out but you can
[25:43] pick out what brother Brown I'm saying
[25:45] if you'll just listen let God speak to
[25:47] your heart listen to what he's saying
[25:49] he said all the ages we've got to run
[25:51] out well they all run out they run out
[25:54] for the ride
[25:55] there is no other age is there no is
[25:57] there another bright age no I don't
[25:59] think so no no so all ages have run out
[26:02] that's right you saw your
[26:04] yeah your body's in the lab of CNA but
[26:07] if you're born again you're caught out
[26:08] so see when when the Ephesus Church was
[26:10] called out there was a Smyrna Church to
[26:12] come right right to be called out that's
[26:15] right there was a pergamist age to be
[26:17] called out now is there one past Dutch
[26:19] no no what does it go into past us
[26:21] eternity
[26:22] so is there any other agent no
[26:25] have we been called out yes then we're
[26:28] not in no age
[26:30] are you denominational in your soul no
[26:32] then all denominations
[26:35] that's what brother Brown was talking
[26:36] about he was talking to a group of
[26:38] people but he knew there was a group
[26:39] coming that was going to shave all that
[26:41] junk out of their life or God was going
[26:43] to do it and what was he going to do he
[26:46] was going to take you out of the age
[26:47] sure you're still in the age
[26:49] Lord we know we're in this age
[26:52] we drove a loudest in car we turned on
[26:54] our lattice and electricity right right
[26:57] I haven't seen any horse and Buggies
[26:59] coming from still in the parking lot
[27:03] but I believe that the people in the in
[27:06] the during these ages before are going
[27:08] to really
[27:09] I think they saw us
[27:11] they they at least saw the Spirit of the
[27:13] age any High minded levels of pleasure
[27:15] more lovers from God and all these
[27:17] things that lay out a sins wretched
[27:19] miserable blind naked and don't know it
[27:21] I think they God let them see and
[27:23] they're going to really I'm I'm serious
[27:25] they're going to look for you when we've
[27:27] been on the other side they're going to
[27:28] look for you and they're going to say
[27:30] how in the world did you make it out of
[27:31] the most wicked age
[27:33] could ever watch
[27:35] you think it was wicked back in the
[27:37] fourth age when they killed 68 million
[27:39] Christians
[27:40] brother rammsted spiritually they're
[27:42] killing them by the billions now
[27:44] and I'd rather be naturally dead than
[27:46] spiritually dead I'm naturally dead and
[27:48] I'm born again I'm okay right I'm
[27:50] spiritually dead and still alive I'm
[27:51] dead
[27:53] man right that's right so we have been
[27:55] caught out of the age so we have no more
[27:58] ages to the bride there is no more ages
[28:01] right right
[28:03] all right to the denomination inside of
[28:06] you if you're born again there's no more
[28:07] denomination that's right so I can see
[28:10] what he's talking about right not verses
[28:12] that that we got to wait till the
[28:14] literal clock quits ticking
[28:17] so he comes this time the longer when
[28:20] time has run out folks time has run out
[28:23] what other time are we promised we're
[28:26] promised a Rapture right that's it
[28:28] brother Brown said the next greater the
[28:30] next great
[28:31] event is the rapture of the right right
[28:35] so time is no longer
[28:38] if time was longer we would have got out
[28:40] here in 77. we got out here in 80 88
[28:43] 2000 all in predictions that people have
[28:45] made right but times no longer we go up
[28:48] when the last one comes in there's no
[28:50] time to it what would help me a lot on
[28:53] uh everybody gets Sandra Brown is coming
[28:55] back and people don't see it just the
[28:58] spirit is not the same person yeah
[29:00] yeah Elijah Elijah and all those well
[29:03] remember one thing it's the voice is
[29:05] what carries us out of here
[29:08] right it's the voice it's what carries
[29:10] us out of here the voice in a five-fold
[29:12] minister
[29:14] we need to read that maybe in Ephesians
[29:16] the Bible says for the perfecting of the
[29:19] Saints nobody else has been perfected
[29:21] and no we didn't get to that
[29:23] uh we got this for about three minutes
[29:25] let's turn to
[29:27] page 72
[29:30] anyway brother Brown says on paragraph
[29:33] 69
[29:34] just hold that word Redemption
[29:37] all right because that's what the Seven
[29:39] Seals are going to be but let's turn to
[29:40] page 72. which will be paragraph
[29:45] 91.
[29:48] this is the Adam and Eve Park that
[29:51] brother Branham is talking to
[29:54] the two different sets of people
[29:55] remember he's born again why in the
[29:57] world are we at Revelations 5 and
[29:59] everybody's crying
[30:04] we need bodily Redemption
[30:06] 91 and when Nature and people as the
[30:08] Bible are groaning it shows there's
[30:10] something that they're not in their
[30:11] ought to be condition
[30:13] everybody got paragraph 91.
[30:16] they have fallen from somewhere
[30:19] now if you're born again today are you
[30:21] fallen no your soul is not your soul
[30:24] just is redeemed it's God make manifest
[30:27] in no form all right they have fallen
[30:29] from somewhere now we don't need anybody
[30:31] to interpret that for us see for of
[30:33] course we know it was eternal life they
[30:35] had fallen from and they lost their
[30:37] claims on eternal life
[30:40] by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell
[30:42] from eternal life to death in the Garden
[30:43] of Eden though they didn't lose eternal
[30:45] life in their soul
[30:46] daddy cold and it's Sunday brother Brown
[30:48] said Adam will reach over and take hold
[30:50] of Eve he will reach over and take care
[30:51] take hold of of Abel and then Seth and
[30:54] all the way down the line what they're
[30:56] coming up all right
[30:59] to death in the Garden of Eden and
[31:01] brought all nature under them to death a
[31:03] tree never died before Adam an animal
[31:05] Wouldn't Die before Adam there's only
[31:07] one thing that cannot die and that's God
[31:08] because he's Eternal and that's the only
[31:10] way we can ever keep from dying we have
[31:12] to have eternal life in us to be Sons
[31:14] and Daughters of God but when we died as
[31:17] I said in the message this morning to
[31:18] sin we sold out our Birthright and
[31:20] caught crossed this Chasm what we were
[31:23] born from natural Mom and Daddy natural
[31:25] seed all right and this this right here
[31:27] these couple of pages proved to me that
[31:30] natural seed don't save anybody because
[31:31] watch this
[31:33] yeah
[31:34] but when we died I said in a message
[31:36] this morning to sin we sold out our
[31:37] Birthright across this Chasm now we're
[31:39] beyond the reach of God
[31:41] no beyond the reach of God
[31:44] on this other side of the chasm now of
[31:46] course when Adam fell to death he
[31:48] brought death upon all creation
[31:51] now he was given three more agency it
[31:53] was given to them just as we so to make
[31:56] a choice
[31:57] 94 paragraph 94. the Adam and Eve in the
[32:00] beginning there was a tree of right and
[32:01] wrong before them and that same tree
[32:03] sits before each and every one of us
[32:06] all right
[32:08] 95 paragraph 95 but you see when we are
[32:11] redeemed we are no more we no more want
[32:13] our own choice but we want his choice
[32:16] now go to paragraph 99 now when Adam
[32:20] sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning
[32:22] instead of holding to the word of God
[32:23] that's what that's what made Adam sin
[32:27] his wife reasonable with Satan and then
[32:29] produced the product to Adam and Adam
[32:30] turned loose the word and sold out
[32:33] now you know the doctrine of the message
[32:34] they think that Adam had to have sex
[32:36] with they need to save her but let me
[32:37] prove something right here
[32:39] he lost also his inheritance when he
[32:43] lost his fellowship and right to life
[32:47] and to save space let's just go down to
[32:49] paragraph 103.
[32:51] now remember everybody knows Adam was a
[32:54] god of the Earth
[32:58] Adam lost his inheritance paragraph 103.
[33:01] the Earth it loses eternal life he lost
[33:04] his inheritance to the Earth what did
[33:07] Revelation 5 say we'll be Kings and
[33:09] Priests over
[33:11] the Earth there's full redemption in
[33:13] Revelations 5. this is how we lost it
[33:15] Revelation 5 is going to show us how we
[33:16] get it back
[33:17] now it passed from his hand I'm sorry
[33:20] I'm too loud
[33:21] now it passed from his hand to the one
[33:23] he sold out to Satan
[33:25] now he couldn't hold on to it because
[33:27] he's not a Creator and he can't do
[33:29] anything about it so Satan's just a
[33:31] squatter
[33:32] because remember he sold his faith in
[33:34] God to Satan's reasoning therefore his
[33:36] eternal life his right to the Tree of
[33:38] Life his right to the Earth belonged to
[33:40] him and he forfeited every bit to the
[33:43] hands of Satan right he passed it from
[33:46] his hand to Satan now Satan's not the
[33:48] original owner you're going to see in a
[33:49] few minutes that the book went back to
[33:50] the original owner Satan just had a
[33:53] little bit of hold on it because when
[33:54] God said you'll be a serpent Now dust
[33:57] you'll eat that's what he's been doing
[33:58] he's been eating
[34:00] therefore now it has been it returned
[34:02] and has been polluted now listen to this
[34:04] right here and the seed of Adam the seed
[34:08] natural seed they come forth out of his
[34:11] loins we're all adults we know what
[34:13] we're talking about the seed of Adam has
[34:16] destroyed the inheritance
[34:18] that Adam should have had
[34:21] that's the Earth that's right the seed
[34:24] of Adam
[34:26] I'm not finished let's go right on over
[34:28] to paragraph 111.
[34:31] it's page 75 of paragraph 111. now what
[34:34] happened the polluted seed of Adam has
[34:38] polluted and absolutely
[34:40] destroyed the Earth remember we weren't
[34:42] supposed to come by saying
[34:44] any man born of sex was a problem of
[34:46] Revelations 5 was there when everybody
[34:48] was crying
[34:50] right no man was worthy there's only one
[34:54] man that was worthy and he was born not
[34:56] a thing right
[34:58] that gets pulled to me it gets more
[35:00] plain as the day is long you know right
[35:02] that that Adam that Adam's natural
[35:05] genetic seed that he had a relationship
[35:08] with Eve did not save him actually that
[35:12] polluted her more
[35:15] did it not that's right did Abel not die
[35:19] did Seth not die that's right did
[35:22] everybody after that now we know Eno was
[35:24] a was a different story but God took him
[35:26] to show how he's going to do us but
[35:28] listen
[35:30] do you know the Bible says that and
[35:32] because that he has did this the
[35:34] polluted seed of Adam God will destroy
[35:37] them now tell me how he saved Eve
[35:41] by placing a natural seed and he loved
[35:44] Eve he knew Eve was going to die if he
[35:47] did not say God I will take her sin
[35:51] she's a part of me if you and same thing
[35:54] as Moses
[35:55] God God said get out of the way and
[35:57] we'll destroy him right what did Moses
[35:59] say he didn't go run and start having a
[36:00] relationship with him let's just be
[36:01] plain right Abraham didn't go run and
[36:04] have a relationship with Sarah to save
[36:06] her when she giggled in her heart and
[36:08] brother around said God should have
[36:09] destroyed her right there but he
[36:10] couldn't destroy because of who
[36:12] Abraham loved her she was a part of him
[36:16] God could not kill now if Abraham would
[36:19] have turned around and said woman you
[36:21] did the wrong thing she'd have died
[36:24] Abraham didn't have to run in and have a
[36:26] relationship with Sarah to save her no
[36:28] in his heart he loved that woman God
[36:30] knew it
[36:32] and God knew the Integrity of Abraham
[36:34] that's why you sisters can't preach
[36:37] okay
[36:39] right that's why any sisters can't
[36:42] preach because you take on a different
[36:43] seed
[36:45] than what God has for you that's right
[36:48] let's just be honest I mean that's
[36:49] that's really the reason because you're
[36:50] weaker
[36:51] and Eve was weaker Adam knew that God
[36:55] knows we're weak
[36:56] we're the bride we're women
[36:59] okay we're weak he knows we're weak
[37:02] that's why he did what he had to do
[37:04] right he took us to himself to save
[37:06] actually Adam took on death remember
[37:09] Adam could have said that he could have
[37:11] said Destroyer I'll take another one and
[37:13] he would have been just right
[37:15] but no he couldn't do that he had to die
[37:18] because when Adam took on each sin
[37:20] physically 900 years later he died
[37:23] right but he didn't lose his eternal
[37:25] life but he died a physical man let's go
[37:29] we're going to read probably in the next
[37:30] three or four or five six pages
