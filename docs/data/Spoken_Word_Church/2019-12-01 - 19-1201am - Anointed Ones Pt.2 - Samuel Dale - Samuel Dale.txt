and touch by the aisle brother there can brother colleagues our Lord touch him just keep bringing them on out of these brother Dale is doing marvelous and we appreciate it sister Mary and we pray that you would just be with each one have your way now and keep us in jesus name amen we're going to Matthew 24 Matthew 24 we'll begin about verse 15 he says when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the Holy Place whoso readeth let him understand now that's really the mosque of Omar alright standing in the holy place you're in that position the mosque of Omar as we call it so then is the abomination that maketh desolation alright then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountain let him which be on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with suck and to them that give suck with child in them that you'll suck in the last days alright now this is coming on down to from the mosque of Omar coming down to Titus and AD 70 alright we'll treat you to review that just a little bit but that's actually what's taking place here is this is what happened in Titus in AD 70 when he come into destroyed Jerusalem that's why that was bad for them to be here they couldn't be left they was left in the city then they'd be destroyed so they had to leave okay we pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day so you get out of Jerusalem Titus was coming for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or thyre believe it not now we'll get to that in a minute we'll do who's this Christ for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now we know they will not be able to be very close behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert in other words this great Christ this Antichrist is in time being you know wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shina 'the even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be now coming right down to the last days now here's the point for who saw it for water so ever the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered together amen he must be seated the Lord had his blessing for the reading of the word now we won't we tried to pick up a little bit the life service and spoke just a little bit about anointed ones but we want to make sure - to see this and find out because it says here in the last days they'd be false Christ the false Christ Matthew 24 that would be false Christ don't go after them they'll say that here there say they'll die there say their doctor don't go after them because you get caught and you'll be in the wrong place alright so as I'm saying this is when it comes down to the mosque of Omar that was to be put it was put into the place door of the temple and then coming on down to Titus when Titus came into Jerusalem and destroyed it in AD 70 senior fulfilling the Scriptures of what is to take place all right it's not something hard to be understood it's something that we must think about for a little bit all right seeing those things as it happened but then we come on down to the very hour that we're living okay and someone would come and say there Christ all right now for someone to come today and get up and preach in the pulpits around America even and say that he's Jesus well now there's some white balls and twist up points along the way that some will do that but not not a whole lot they're not going to say that they're Jesus because that's just a little bit too much but they'll be saying they are the Christ because Christ means The Anointed One all right that's what the word Christ me because that's who Jesus was he was the Lord Lord the Christ he was the anointed God he was God in human flesh what all God was he poured into Christ see pouring himself into that human flesh that we called Jesus and he was called the Christ all right so then Christ means The Anointed One all right he's putting in that place so we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we believe in the Christ and it being in the correct way because Christ is among us Christ is that baptism with the Holy Ghost that you have in the new birth that is the Christ that's the son of the Living God coming and living in you see to make us to what we need to be alright so then it's the Christ it's this age this is the age of the fulfilling of all things we would have to admit that we were down here at the end of all of it if you don't then go home turn on the news and look what's happening between the time you were in service here in an hour or so and you go home and read what's happened and you'll see the world is fastly falling apart all right and those things are taking place around the world you'll see earthquakes in divers places and all kind of things that we just read about all of the the masses of destruction is taking place in our day all right we'll see then we're not to look at those things a lot of people have taught and I'm not throwing off and on nobody but they've talked you know that Russia is this communism is this and this is that it is but there's no scripture for communism or Russia coming to take over that's just man's ideas there's no scripture that teaches that there is I'd like to see it you know you say well it's this is the king of that is you know but it's remember it's not that it's got to be something religious if the word Christ means The Anointed One and if that we do believe in the Lord Jesus Christ you know and believing him to be Almighty God all right see then we're looking for something to be deceiving not just something to say this you know and I've always told you my my brother-in-law he used to say that what he thought would be that great beast in the end time would be a great big King Kong walking across the earth you know no one walking like that I said well now who's that going to deceive I said might scare a lot of people you know and they decide to run but it ain't going to deceive nobody it's got to be something very religious all right see that's why I'm referring to it as the Christ to get you to see me looking for that Christ because there is just one little bit added to it and what did it become in the last days is to be the Anti Christ right instead of Christ Antichrist all right Sid we've all blue can talk about as I said people say Russia China this Saturday order some of those countries they're there they're the Antichrist well we know they are the Antichrist because they're against Christ but yet that still doesn't make them the Antichrist because it tells us here that to be careful that these things can happen and it would deceive the very elect if it was possible now that's how close it'll be so it can't be some King Kong monsters on this that or the other you know looking for those things don't get into that get into thinking about the Bible and looking at Jesus Christ and then seeing that it's got to be real close it can't be a great big art shutter some word over that and deceive with it it's got to be so close think all right so in the last days now is to come to an apostle 'ti of being so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible and like the Prophet said one day he said frankly to get them thought up that he had to cut it short you know he may have to do some things because of the deception in the land today because that's what people are believing all right looking for the Antichrist when we've all just been brought right down through that thing because anti-crisis Anti Jesus so we know it's not Jesus that we're looking for it's an antichrist it's an anointing so now you look across the land and you see it everywhere that you have these great ministers and great things taking place and some of you came through Pentecost and you saw the great things that happen back there in the anointings that would fall in and you see it today around the land of how the the things are that way but we've got to be careful because if it catches us in the wrong ranks we're gonna have problems and the wrong ranks to me is what I'm talking about is in the wrong position or thought as my old saying is if you're going to catch a bus don't go down to the airport you know there might be one down there but they don't tell me where you might get you get on it you know go to the bus depot alright so what am I saying what am i point go to the Word of God study the Word of God and see what the Word of God says about these things then as we see what it says then we can follow that and see the day that we're living and see right we're reading and why it's to be see don't worry about all of these great big things well here comes Russia will look Russia they're supposed to be down but don't worry about it now Russia will be used yes no come on Russia will be used the old buyer just went to sleep no see you don't worry about you come up there and there'll be bombs falling every which way one of these days because that's what they're building up see they just went undercover with it and and went bankrupt as we call it and if they demanded payment of us at the same time that they demanded it to them we would have went bankrupt you know but to see we're we can't do that called we're going to be overnight revelations 13 I don't want to get too much into that but you get over in Revelations 13 see the word 13th nation you know in different things that's the United States and who would have the power to control the world in a war outside of you and I I mean America the America has the power to control those things and that's why it's based on that and that's why we are in that position and no one is standing there horror but thinking now what we're going to talk about that the Bible said they would come false Christ right now we've established a point of what now Christ means The Anointed One alright and see then that's what we're looking for something to that is in the anointing rim to deceive you say yeah brother well God won't let us be deceived but you don't need to play too much with God either because there's a lot in the Bible that is dire and it's because of the fact to try you and I right how about just reading a few scriptures let's get a little bit this let's go through this this morning and then we'll get you know we'll get to the lives let's go to the number two brothers on our scripture there of Joel 2 let's just think about it says it shall come to pass afterward that I'll pour it my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke all right yeah Joel is speaking of in the compound form so think about it now he's speaking of the coming of the day of Pentecost when God poured out his spirit upon the people of that day you know alright but it didn't finish that because he said he poured out upon all flesh see it comes on down to a greater meaning so it's in our day our day is to expect to see and Azusa Street fulfill that to the point of the Spirit of God being poured out there on the day of Azusa Street in 1906 there in in California and that fulfilled that but that's still not to finish because he's gonna pour it out upon all flesh you mean God will pour out his Spirit upon far oh yeah he poured rest this morning I woke up about two or three o'clock somewhere this morning it was just rain in like everything I laid there I said thank you Lord for the rain but you know what I was thinking for the rain because the pasture in front you know it needs to rain well you know everywhere else needed the rain see then he poured it out not just on my pasture and just dump the buckets you know and went out through the pasture and and said no he poured it out on all of this area no telling how far it went north east south and west of the rain coming because it support out upon all they the same rain that brings forth your corn that you've planted will also bring forth the briars and the thistles and the things in your garden that you've got a hole out right because that's that's what it's doing all right but now listen he said he'd pour out of him pour out his spirit when Azusa Street came into being now look some of you may not be familiar with that but it's the beginning of Azusa Street was the beginning of Pentecost in the last days their own in California all right and you have a lot of Pentecostal people still left around the world who go with that and thanks all right but that's that's the point that God poured out there on those people in spirit now you have to be real careful with it when God is pouring out his spirit because he would say I'll pour my spirit on all flesh he he doesn't make differences in his pouring out he pours it out on all all right now that can be very deceiving you say yeah but do you mean that that God would pour out his Spirit upon the false people he poured it out on the briars don't don't he pour the Rhine on the briars don't they pour the thing you say yeah but you sound like you're making God do something well I am I'm making him do what a word said he does all right let's just read something in the word going over to number 4 brothers will pick up Deuteronomy and let's just see what God says about what he'll do in this day of the false Christ then we get back to that in a minute and and determine the you got for a excuse me now listen if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give it the assign or a wonder now we read in the Bible this is what we're supposed to be based on right scriptural then what and the sign are the Wonder come to Pais we're all he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them now you listening signs and wonders to come to Pais great things to happen if there's anybody in the world today healed it what so eat of anything God done the healing right right come on then see look and I shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet what if he take you to another God now look how easy it is Christ Antichrist that's how close it is now come on we'll get down to it in a minute that God poured out his spirit on all see the anointing comes from God Himself water I shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proved with you now listen he proved with you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul now he's gonna pour out things are gonna happen great signs and wonders by somebody coming and giving you a sign in other words some preacher come in here and he says we're gonna roll bout four caskets in here in a minute and we got four proven to be dead people and you know but I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna lay hands on them and and they're gonna raise up from the dead well that's good I mean you were to rejoice you know instead of looking at me and wonder what's going on you ought to be smiling to think that God would do those and you can know but what if he takes you to another god I remember my point keep it in mind Christ and Antichrist Antichrist is so close to Christ until it's just that little point you just added was not that what happened in the Garden of Eden was it not there that Satan just added one word to Eve and it caused all of this to break down there's you beginning of your Antichrist which Christ is the word right all right see then are you following me the point I'm trying to make somebody give you a great sign in wonder and it come to pies what are you gonna do well we got to believe that because this happened that happened and we've seen it three people raised the dead but what does it take you to another God what if they try to teach you something wrong in the Word of God now you've got a problem and God said or the dreamer dream before the lord god prove with you the three raises of the dead what are you gonna do you gonna follow down and worship that person you're gonna declare that person to be of some great authority from God then raise three from the dead I'm playing the language don't ask me to try don't don't go in the wrong direction either cuz we've seen the dead right so we're about to have we've seen that so don't worry about it the man raised up from the dead don't worry about it we've seen too much all right I'm not trying to do it that way I'm trying to get you to think think about the day in the hour that we're living in a deception that's in the land today and the things about the religious world of Christianity and how that there's 900 or more different denominations out of one Bible out of one Bible there's nine hundred and something different interpretations right not throwing no stones cause he who lives in the glass house he better be careful he don't want to throw stones he lives in Glass House what do you mean I mean we don't throw off on nobody we just try to tell it like it is the engines talking like it is in plain language all right the three raises from the dead what are you going to do he if he takes you to another God are you going to follow his teaching cause remember one thing we're talking about Christ remember a man in the Old Testament called Balaam you remember him Balaam could do all things that Moses and him could do there's nothing wrong with his anointing he even prophesied about the coming of the Lord Balaam with nothing wrong with the prophecy because he couldn't prophesy something contrary to the Word of God and be God's prophet and he was God's prophet he's here but he was Falk now that was made false when he faced stood up before Moses and Emlyn shoulder Elisha and then you come on down with all the other stories then he becomes and shows forth and proves he's what he is but just remember he was a prophet and what he prophesied is written in God's Word the yet is teaching his teaching was what was wrong right he talked to children of Israel to do things that was wrong Ricci Bible and this in doing those things he he took his rope to destruction yeah what he said was the truth there's your anointed ones Balaam could not say something wrong by the spirit now he could do it by his own self and teach the people wrong and he did but yet in the Holy Spirit if it spoke Balaam had to speak what the Holy Spirit how about who is it coughs the one that was the high priest when Jesus was there and Caiaphas prophesied and said it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people that was the anointing of the Holy Ghost on caucus and he was the guy that put Jesus on the cross come on read your Bible he was the guy that put him on the cross declara didn't seem forth but he'd already profits out it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people so if not they were gonna have it up rising on the insurrection was gonna take place so coughs was trying to solve it and he prophesied the very thing that would be happen that they'd take Jesus out and crucify him and they would not have an insurrection of the good you know in the land did the Christ and calf was cutting under that anointing then he could go out and do wrong and make the Sun but under that anointing of the Holy Spirit he could not say nothing except what God said come on go back to Balaam when he was told you know go ahead and do this he said I'll go over said I can only tell you what God tells me read your Bible I can only do what God says for me to do he was straight about it he knew what he was doing not away see because that anointing was on him and see you say you mean that that the Holy Spirit can be on somebody that's wrong like that I'll remind you of one thing in the Old Testament there was not anybody warned again wait a minute now what do you mean there was nobody born-again in the Old Testament Jesus Christ had to come and die to give his life to be able to release it to be able to save people there was nobody in the Old Testament saved under the basis of what we talk about salvation they didn't accept Jesus Christ as their Savior they rejected all of it down through there but you see the point anointed ones how are you gonna know the difference now remember we just read where God would send these among us to try you want to read it again that God would send this among us to try they got these things they call them out deprogram and you know they've they got you your program this way then they take you in deprogram you well that don't work too good with me no I hate how trouble finding my brain to be able to program it but you know but listen Church what I'm trying to get you to city that we read there in Matthew 24:24 that in the last days they would be false Christ's false Christ's it would be anointed people right Christ anointed people you see them in the land today look all across the land I'm gonna take it no I'm just telling yo you you got a mind you've been using it you know who's about their preaching and what's taking place you know Benny hen walked off the platform one day and walked right out in the congregation turn walk back we're not denying the truth of what's happened because the anointing is here if poured out its anointing its the Christ poured out it's him to bring forth but he wants to try people the Prophet said it like this one day he said he wants to prove that this bride won't fail like he did the Eve took Satan's word this shade one word he just said you shall not and she took that and it created all the havoc that we have in the world all the troubles is because of the fall in the garden how close is it to us then yes for brother Dale I know the Spirit of God I can just feel it you do you know what cuz you can just feel it well what if it don't speak according to the word what if it takes you to another God you got to admit the Trinity doctrine the God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal something like that has deceived the religious world and brought it into their ranks brought it to their own people so there's no such thing as a trinity in the Bible short to me show me the word Trinity in the Bible it's not that that was taken it I can show you even in your we don't need to encyclopedias anymore okay the I used to say I can take your cuz I got a piece in my Bible here that I can show you where all look the water baptisms and things was changed by the Catholic Church we don't need no come don't need nothing doing that paperwork no more pop it in your cell phone right now type in Trinity in your cell phone you'll see where it comes up where it come from right it was established by the Catholic Church starting off at 325 AD that's the first Nazi in council what do you see in that form I'm saying it to show you what we're talking about if they take you to another God they take you to another teaching or another doctor in another point you got to stay with the word that's why all I ask show me in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized father son Holy Ghost I got away from them saying what he used to say cuz he used to say I'll give you ten thousand dollars you'll come short to me but they got so many perversions today till you know I got them the language is poverty they got all these things for verdict it better be careful I guess what we say but I'll just say it in plain language come show me the word Trinity in the Bible show me three guards in the Bible what's the first commandment hold all this with the Lord on the hardest one they've never been but one guard taught in the Bible and anybody teaching anything outside of that is an antichrist anti teaching and that's the point of what I'm getting at Deuteronomy says there's there's wonder it's and back over in Deuteronomy says if a prophet give you a sign that comes up I suppose to follow the Prophet that's Bob but here comes the understanding of what if he takes it to another God another teaching like I said there was nothing wrong with the anointing of Balaam I remember the Prophet talking about him one day and he said to be a prophet in Israel meant a lot you realize that I'm not a prophet in Lulla no problem I'm not supposed to be huh did you say what are you talking about don't don't tell me to bring signs and wonders of a prophet cuz i'm not in that class yet God has used this and done things but my point is what is that anointing that's on you what is it remember Satan can pass out supernatural gifts every day of his doing so don't put it on gifts don't say what brother Dale I know cuz see you say well I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried they do it the ballgame whole lot more than we do right they shout all over the place until they just go haywire they never didn't like me I told him adorable one day I said how come to me all the all with this ballgame stuff and all this volume stuff I said cheapest game you've ever heard his football one guy you know what he said the Falcons alone is worth billions of dollars I said will you answer me one question I said when they start the game what do they do three or four guys gets on one side three or four gets on the other side they'll up gets in the middle he takes out a quarter and he thumps the quarter up in the iron to see whether it lands on heads or tails and the rest of the game is hollering Hawk get the quarterback you get it rest of the game they holler and get the quarterback well if you can't afford to lose quarter now don't tell me how many pigeons you were sorry about that little something to break the the dead feeling off of you get you from smiling instead of frowning because you wondering what I'm doing what I'm doing there's one thing I'm trying to tell you one thing for sure the Bible drop right and it says in the life stage that would be false Christ the anointing now let's get to this serious part the anointing of Satan is great he can pass out gifts new things of his own remember the Bible called him The Anointed cherub who stood beside the Lord come on it was the anointed cherub he stood right beside the Lord he in other words he was God's right hand man until he fell well what you see the main thing is to get what we want a few minutes to this talk about that then it said there'd be false christs all right now was Balaam false no he was a genuine prophet until he faced a larger name he was a genuine prophet until he faced the word he was riding all the other things even his prophecy was right cause he spoke of the coming of the Lord in the last days right look how wonderful look at Moses with all the things they could do was he not anointed that true Moses was anointed but Balaam was anointed you can't go by the anointing or what you think about of the feelings and the things like that you can't go about one thing but the Word of God yeah but I felt it I I know I'm I know I've got the Holy Ghost I felt it was the Word made alive to you what about she the only way you will ever know the difference in the cross in the Antichrist is by the word check him out by the word what are you supposed to do I know where old Pentecostal seems to say you know they get and look each other in the face you know and I'm earning your spirit well that ain't no discerning no spirit cuz I don't work we just try somebody by the word you see I just flopped it out now to try the congregation to see whether you believe the Word of God or not do you believe in one true and living God in Jesus being his night because you don't your aunt across now I just flopped it out but let's see you come and take the Word of God and explain it of the Christ because that Christ is the genuine it's genuine it's the Christ it's the Anointed One he was the anointed one that was anointed with the anointing right cuz he was the Lord to Christ the Bible says but what about me and you you realize that baptism of the Holy Ghost that you received to give you the new birth putting you in the body of Christ makes you the Christ the Lord it makes you a child of God makes you the Christ and see by being the Christ then we have within us the very life of Christ and no wonder Paul could say the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God cuz he knew what was inside of him can we be deceived the real true pride can never be deceived to the point of being lost no that won't work you can't put it that way because it you'd make him giving you eternal life and taking it away but the Christ the Anointed One comes and lives in you and I in the new birth and we become little messiahs right he's the Messiah were the messiahís we're his children right don't think about it think about this Christ and remember the anointing that was on Balaam was genuine the anointing that was upon koffice was genuine there was not the devil's anointing it was a true genuine Holy Spirit now we're stepping up a life - you got to think a little bit with me Satan can do a lot of things but he can't be the Holy Ghost he can pass out gifts he can do all that but he cannot be the Anointed Christ it can't be I remember what we brought out the other day this will be for later in a message just remember anointed ones they are not sealed in the body of Christ only born-again believers are sealed into the body of Christ the difference between just being anointed or the Holy Spirit that's why Balaam could be anointing of the Holy Spirit and go out and do all the things wrong Catholics could declare Jesus Christ to be and have him killed but yet he was the anointing was right he's not it's not the fact that you are an anointed one that makes you saved oh we just said something didn't and now you're gonna have to explain it anointed ones are not sealed in the body of Christ because the anointing is on your spirit we'll get back to that later I don't want to get into it and talk much okay but think about it anointed ones we say Old Glory Aidan it's something that I feel the Spirit of God that's wonderful we should we should be happy we should rejoice right but just remember you can feel every bit of that and still not be right you can feel every bit of those things that still not be right well what do you how do you tell the difference by the word by the word right so what do we try each other by by the word what you should be trying me today is by wearing whether or not I'm staying with the word and if I'm not you come show me where I'm off that's the point is I can be open call see I'm not trying to be some kind of a Christ to lead you to an idea or a thought I'm trying to be a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ and leads you to the word and unless you decide yourself remember it's left up to you whether or not it's the truth not left up to me it's not left up to where we could raise the dead it's not left up to worth that this could happen in that could happen cuz we just read in Deuteronomy what if God lets that happen he's doing it to tries to see who we are Percy if we will stay with his word where would evolve that word one word he turned down the word you just think about those Pharisees and Sadducees standing there before the Lord Jesus Christ which was according to John 1:14 I'm limited in that he was the word made flesh and they crucified him right they killed the very Christ that they claimed that they were serving and claiming him to be they couldn't argue with him who was it Nicodemus he said we know that you're a teacher come from God we know but nobody can do the things you do read your Bible he said nobody can do the things you do without God being with him yet when he just said you must be born again Nicodemus just fell backwards and Senator understands you you mean I got to go back to my mother's womb come back out of my mother's womb you know to be born again Jesus said if I speak to you of heavenly thing or earthly things and how can you do it you said you can't understand heavenly Nicodemus wanted to talk to God he came to him to see him and talk with him but yet he turned down the word because he admitted the anointing was right come on what is it to be then according to Matthew 24:24 then in the last days that be Christ's false Christ the anointing is not false look at this for a second and we'll quit the anointing that's on Balaam was not false it was a genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost the same anointing that was on Balaam was on Elijah that anointing is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the new birth of who else is not we need we don't need this to be anointed of son spirit we need to birth of that spirit within our heart see those Old Testament Saints they couldn't go no further than the point of just having a point of believing in it and being anointed to that because Jesus Christ had not come and died in their stead but that's no excuse now for me and you are we just anointed ones well brother Gary Atkins sister say it like this he said brother Dale he said me and you are not too much of knowing at Arwa I said I have to agree we what's your point you mean the devil and his children can outshine the bride across it's getting pretty close but you see now here is the point we'll get to the two anointed ones as I said they're not sealed in the body they're just anointed on there spirit and we do back to that later it's just anointed on their spirit because you're a body spirit soul you're three rim person or whatever you are see you know you've got these parts that works for this and what works with it body see taste feel smell in here then spirit memory reason conscience affections and things like that working with that inside of you there's a soul that's in demand which is not in the animal that's why the animal cannot be a living soul God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul he didn't breathe into the animals and let him become a living soul no he just breathed life he gave them life that's the difference in a dog in a human being a human being as a soul whereas a dog or a cat or something it's just a life not a soul the soul is your being who you are all right I don't want to be anointed in my spirit I want that to be genuine anointing on your spirit is no difference in owning on any anointed that's the point of getting it doesn't matter whether you are born-again Christian or non born-again Christian the anointing is the same its anointing on your spirit right it's anointed in that spirit realm to do and to to worship and to rejoice and have a great time of serving God in that spirit realm but if that's all we do then we're no different than Balaam and kai force or anybody else then really we're not much better than a dog though the dog won't lie here and killed like humans do but now listen anointed ones is what the scripture calls them it calls them false Christ because of something being wrong with that person and what is wrong what was wrong with Balaam his doctrine what was wrong with Caiaphas his doctrine all the rest of it was great line you think Bailey you think Catholics didn't believe in in God you think he didn't believe in the anointing thing he didn't believe in all of the great thing but by believing in all of that put him in a dangerous position because we got to go further than just in her anointing well brother Dale I'm satisfied with the anointing you you seem to like this you don't like hey don't talk to me about anointing okay I've been around too long I've seen God I've seen the dead raised I've smelled God been in his presence inside so don't talk to me about those things it's done too late I'm sorry you don't talk to me come and talk to him about the word just remember before you forget it you say will God permit these things to happen to try us yes he will permit us to be tried the Lord Jesus Christ according to the Bible wasn't tried as we are he was tried he he wouldn't put no special cubicle or a spot and moved out and said he's the stage there he doesn't know he was fighting off his whole life he was fighting the whole time he was here it cost him his life but you see anointed ones is the genuine if we'll get back to it into the message we're going on only wanted a genuine anointing on your spirit and you're still not born again that's hard and they be stumbling to some but just don't stumble just think about it and come back let's talk about it because that anointing can be on your spirit and you can shout speak in tongues glory hallelujah do all kind of things great things can take place and it's an anointing on your spirit it's anointing just on your spirit doesn't mean you're born again brother Brown said you can have the baptism the Holy Ghost everyday life and dying go to hell that we believe that you better start thinking about the norwich one to the fish some statements in her that he's made that we're gonna claim to be the truth think on these things anointed ones that even that anointing is true yet the person could be false right for a person themselves to be false and anointing to be true like on these things come on musicians I want you to just be concerned enough to think on yourself is that anointing on me and brother Dale was talking to her minute ago he made a statement and I still keep making that statement the same anointing that noise anybody else annoys you there's Ness there's not but one babe there's not but one anointing that's why the anointing is genuine the teaching can be false and being false in it proves what we are because we will decide whether or not we accept the word can we say truly the word is the word and say this is it anointed once we can just be anointed with on on our spirit and not be born again Christian but don't forget this statement anointed ones are not sealed in anointed ones that this is like the anointing of that that's not that don't seal you in the body of Christ then anoint your spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what seals us then and that's in the soul that's not in your spirit yet it can be so close what do we do with it we have to judge it by the word now I go back to for a second or what if he comes and he gives you a sound and it comes to Paes and he takes you to another God believe him he takes you to another doctor and another idea that's contrary to the Word of God don't believe it cuz he said I have sent this among you to try you to see whether or not you'll stay with the word false Christ the anointing is not false it can be the genuine Holy Ghost himself he follows do we want to call it false anointed ones the mornings not fog the morning is genuine but the person will be determined by what to do with the word let's stand together [Music] how about it every father [Music] I love you [Music] I bet it every sealed in our we get the door god I love you come to Jarek under anointing ones [Music] inside [Music] Heavenly Father I agree do you [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
