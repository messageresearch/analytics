six o'clock okay you got it it's coming Saturday there will be the Bible study now the children will be meeting at two o'clock is that right I believe that's right two o'clock two o'clock okay we're getting a nod and they will be having their times together so remember that remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother Tony's on the third Saturday of December make your plans to attend and all I can say meant relations for will try to read the first seven verses and then get into our thought anything else that we've missed always we had a real good time yesterday at the festival time and all like that and it was really good it would rain a while and look like it was gonna rain and then it quit and then it rain and quit and we were going up and down with wondering whether to have the the the little cookout things you know where the kids could do so we decided not to have that because you get started and the windup you know started raining and all like that but we had a good time our thoroughly enjoyed it and I just want to give a clapping hand to all of those that helped to do it put on the things and do your games and all for the children I know the children they appreciate that because we had a good time and that I even got to do the nanny couldn't do her part yesterday so I got to I got to have her part and we were fishing for little duckies you know and I happened to admit they told me that I couldn't cheat you know because they always tell you I'd always give too many you know little cards back to everybody you know and all like that and they they said now fall fall that's cheating so you know you don't do that this time we're gonna have a coin and I you know and everything has to match so they got that I still got mine cuz I'd help them hook those okay I'm still a kid that's just the way it goes amen license for one through seven now say that the air as long as he's a child differed nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but his under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world in other words we were lost needing redemption right okay but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to what to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because your sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ our Lord amen you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and we've trying to bring forth we preached on that last weekend in trying to talk about adoption we're in the day and time when that is a big word to be used because there's a lot of it going on you know and we found out a lot of things through adoption and stuff like that that really is it's glorious to help us and the way the the things go on of a natural adoption and all and we learned off for one thing that was something that in in you know you may try to disown one of your children disinherit or whatever you want to do but if you adopt a child you cannot disinherit that child that's the laws see because it's the way that they got everything set down and to do and it's really topping right but we're going right back into understanding all right now what were we talking about last week as we were trying to cover the adoption and bringing it forth that Paul here in Galatians is picking up from the Old Testament the laws of adoption and bringing it forth and man it's showing it and and you know showing us what to expect all right seeing the old law of adoption in the Old Testament they had would be a child born into the family well you know that child is a member of that family sort of born into the family all right you know and it's part of the family with inheritance with all the rest and all but it's not an adopted child because they had to form back there that when they got on up to their time and I always missed that Bar Mitzvah you know his weight groups correcting me all the time that they try to say those words that a child a son back in the Old Testament when they become to a time of maturity unnecessarily age wise but maturity you know they were adopted into the family which put them to the position that they were able to as we call it today write a check you know you've given the authority to do all kinds of things and you know and he was placed at to the position to be able to run the farm or to do what was needful because he was a son positionally placed in adoption all right then in doing that it sets a stage back tire and I hope you followed my point and I'll repeat it a couple of times that remember in the Old Testament now you can only deal with the point that you brought into the family as a child you're born into the family all right then you've got the second stage which comes into the stage of the adoption or authority of that child in the family all right now and then doing that then see it cuts off because there's nothing else to give examples with you know you don't have the things the you need to go but you have enough to type up to that point so Paul see he could take that and he could look back in Chapter three and fourth hour of Galatians and he could see that a child coming into the family he even though he's an heir because he's born into the family he's an heir he's a child he he's a member of that family all right but yet he doesn't have the authority to do and all is doing and that's what the father wanted so when a son was born the father would you know after a while raise it up you know they would when they bring it up I don't know what age you would start it off but eventually he would be given a tutor it's mentioned there in the third and then over end of the fourth chapter a tutor or a governor someone to raise that child to teach that child and they would would would take over you know and that would be their tutor you can hire it today you can your children can be grades bad in different things you can hire a tutor to put in the position to try to teach that child you know to upgrade it and see back then the father wanted to be able to his son to come into maturity so he would hire a tutor well that tutor would be the the one that would teach that child well that tutor also had a position to her it would report that person would report to the father and say your son is not acting rotten your child is not acting correctly you know and then I guess they'd out to decide what took place and the doing could have never studied that much ever to see what they do but I do know one thing if that child never reached the maturity of the authority it would remain a child yes but it would not have the right of inheritance in the form of the heir as a son of a manifested son or daughter now we only use appalled in them users only to the men so I told you women now you just hold on you you're in there it's not leaving you out of it it's just an example form that it was done for the Sun in the Old Testament and things like that it was brought into being all right and as it would come forth that Sun would take on the nature now listen the Sun would be trying the father would want the his own nature instilled into his child but how would that nature be come into the child through the tutor so he wouldn't go out and hire the drunk next door to raise his child you know or this out of the other he he'd go out and get the person that was the closest to his nature his ways and his doings to her that he could put that child underneath that tutor or governor you know schoolmaster as Paul calls if they're in relations and they would then that child would come forward when it would come forth whose nature would be in the child you realize then the nature of the tutor would be instilled into the child just as much as the because that's the only way that nature of the father could get into the child is to for that father to you know say okay now I want him raised this way well on it and when he would raise him see and my point is is what it comes forth in the New Testament and you hear the prophet in a minute to read to say that we had the greatest teacher of all placed on us we received a new birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost were born again right into the family of God but then the tutors that is given to us there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in a higher order our point to to to be a razor and you look at it as the same thing as we've been on the statue of perfect man for so long see faith virtue and knowledge difference places growing up into his nature whose nature the nature of the Father God wants his nature instilled into his children well then he picks a tutor that has the closest nature to him right and as he would do those things then who would be actually passing the test you know they say that they can go to a college or something like that and they give them a tutor that they know that tutor so well until I can say well we know who taught this child because of the nature and the ways and the things you know that are in it all right but are you following me now so they're in the Old Testament now you only had the two examples you had the example of being a child born into the family now that child is even though he's an heir we get the scripture says he's no different than a servant there in Galatians truth and forward he's no different than a servant even yet he is heir of all things see he has the right there but yet just because he's born into the family only placed him in the family it didn't place in the way the father wants him so the child would actually just be he would be an heir to her he would be a child right but he wouldn't have the authority and that's what God wants in the Christian for us to do is to come forth to through him as a sin a statue a perfect man the growth development you know in things in the Christian to where it would come to be that we would be like the father so he would give us the new birth think all right we get the new birth that brings us into the body of Christ correct that places us in the body of Christ but then he would give us with that and the Bible said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost after you believe not when you believe so then we don't stop just on that point but we're trying to bring the point one that that child it represents back there within the New Testament he gives us a fuse them with the holy ghost in a higher order because see all of this is the baptism with the holy ghost he's here we were being born again as Peter says you know by the incorruptible Word of God all right and as it's doing then we come to a place of sonship okay goes the son back in the Old Testament he was a son when he's born okay when you and I are born again but the baptism of the Holy Ghost given us the new birth we are the children of God heirs as we'll cover in a few minutes in Romans we're all of those things because we are the children of God but there's more to it than just stay at that point of a child you know coming into the family come on in brother welcome you know there's more to it than just to say well I'm a born-again Christian you know because see that's where we mess up we think that we get everything when we first believe it and that's what no what the scripture said is I was quoting our minute ago it's after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise then so the scripture lays out to show us that the adoption back there was an example that that child was born into the family made him a child made a son made a child are we breaking up no okay okay got you know me now we got it so we got we've got someone welcome and we need to get in and I thought was breaking up because this thing has broke on the bottom and it's not quitting the minute you'll know what either Richard pushed the wrong button or I did one all right but now think about it see backing up just a moment to cover where the brother won't be lost in what we're saying that we are the children of God by the new birth by that new birth we are the children of God heirs of God as well reading Romans even joiners what about that what God would think of his family to make us his children that that you know that would be there in us Gentiles we had no right of any form of adoption the Bible says the Dobson was for Israel go see that was the natural story to line up with the natural people so he got the natural story of Israel and their natural story of adoption that their son was a son but then after a while he was given a tutor and the tutor raised him up to a position and then once he reached that position to where the father could trust him and everything then the father would would give him his signet his seal is his approval to use his name or write a check as we call it today you know and it would come forth as being into that position all right yeah but like now here's the point try to put up where we are now then but see you only had the two stages there the Old Testament you only had the stage of the son born into the family and the next stage was the teacher or tutor are coming to authority because you didn't have anything else to carry on there but Paul picks it up in Galatians C and he advances into the form of bringing it to the New Testament all right and as he brings it to the New Testament then he begins to tell us that there's more to it there's more to it see we will I mean I'm not throwing those stones now we just know we got old Baptists we said we've got it all and we believed well I didn't believe it when I've argued with him because I told him I said why does it say he that believeth you know I was by the way then and that's what I believe but yet still see there's more to the Christian life than they're just going to church being good you know and all like that all that's well and good well that part is good that is the nature instilling that's good it's wonderful but that's not all of it he expects us to come to the position of authority but it's to come to his authority not ours it's not for us see all right salvation is of the Lord John or two and nines they are now see then we come to the position to her that we see these examples are wonderful but when Paul picks it up into the New Testament he continues the thought all right he continues the thoughts he like we look at the pyramid and we see we're born again at faith that's in 2nd Peter there's a born again at faith then we're birthed into these things as God is bringing us forth in the body and teaching us the authority and the position and all like that but then when it gets to where it says Holy Spirit see then there's a place above they are called a headstone well I that headstone was never brought forward they rejected the headstone Jesus Christ was a headstone but they rejected him and see that was not for that back there it would have to wait until the end time as we'll get to it this evening to where that it would come to having that headstone would come and see you can say well I've got this and I've got that all right there's still more of God you know that ever if ever but ever person I make a carnal illustration but it I like him if every person in the world today was born again it'd be a wonderful world wouldn't it but you know that would just be the starting point and that wouldn't be all God wants it's not that he just wants his children born he wants his children to have his authority his his nature his ways is their makeup into me he wants that to be in each one of his children men women children at home because that's that's what God has always desired for his family to have his ways in nature about him like I was always saying I know it's carnal but I don't want my kids to act like the neighbor because I don't want to find out they belong to the neighbor you say well that's carnal well that's plain no it tells it like it is I want them to be to where they can have the my nature in my ways we was going around behind home door one day and the neighbor was dire and you know you know we were talking to him about a horse or something but anyhow Terence was talking to it well we get in the car and leave and come back around the house and Terence said damn I'm glad you didn't look like that then I remember the guy had long hair you know good-looking long hair hanging down I said well okay he said I said why he said because that's the way I'd want to act if that's the way you act okay okay maybe I can't be from having a long higher of a test I'll have to beat the rest if out of him attention okay raising our children you know that God sometimes he has to give us a whippin to bring us into the position to work we're lino okay but now are you following me see then when we get into the New Testament now we've got to come to a higher order because oh let's see how is it that the Bible speaks about the law that he magnified the law he made an honorable he it was many things that God done to the law he didn't just throw it away all right and see that's what God wants with all of us he wants us to come to a place that he can trust us then he can put his confidence in us that he can give us his nature in his ways that's all that I'm trying to teach on adoption and you think we'll adoption I said did not entity think it's a simple point it's simple it's just becoming more like God and acting like him all right and here Paul is covering that sea but the air as long as he's in a Chow she born into the fan he still everything's not right yeah God wants more of you and me other than to just be the point of trying to get us born again you know we say well will we send out this we sent out with we don't try to have these deep things in the message or something we try to have it simple well the most simple thing there is is an uber but you know what that's the deepest thing there is in the Bible because it was God's first doctrine right is that right the Lord Jesus first doctor knee priests was you must be born again and see the whole Bible is you must be born again all right now are you listening and getting the point then see it then the son when he's a son that's when he's born so bringing that into the New Testament and we see that when a person is born again that makes them a child of God puts them in a wonderful position to be brings us to a position there to where we can start something we can start growing seeing the Bible says grow in grace and knowledge all right see then that's where people messed up people messed up by thinking we could everything when we believe are you Pentecostals when they say well we speak in tongues we shouted we done we got it all well see that's not that's just a start that's my whole point of trying to get you to see it is you're a new birth it just starts your journey because you're born to get it faith all right then these things have to grow into us and grow in grace and knowledge and things all right and as it comes forth then see we don't stay just a child I mean yeah you know I mean you you got pictures in your billfold or ladies with your pocketbook but when you kids within a certain age and and really you're like from the state that way you know I used to have them on the wall at the home not going on Excel which way to stayed that away way Terrence stayed that way and an estate that away but you know that's well and good but you know what that's not the way God wants it and they wasn't given to us to be that away our children were given to us to be raised to bring in a nature in a way all right see that's where the Prophet said people messed up by thinking they got everything when they believed well you know there's a growth development there's more to it what because it didn't just stop as to come into a family it doesn't even just stop us to come into having full authority but that's what everybody wants right everybody wants the authority oh we want this willing that we want we want to to control less this but C Authority without character it's satanic you take authority and have no character with that you don't even want them working for you at work you've got you got to the boxes and things event you don't want them people to be there when they want to run everything their way you didn't hire them for that they always tried to tell them use this and here Chet Atkins didn't hire people to play the way they wanted to he hired him to play the way he wanted him to play and if they didn't like it they could get out the door you know but maybe God order throw us out the door sometimes but okay now go on what see the Holy Spirit is our tutor all right so when you come into the New Testament now you're coming into a different position cause now listen to the point even though in the Old Testament you had the son that would be born into the family even though you would give him a tutor a person to raise them that still never gave them a new birth there was no new birth in the Old Testament you say well no wait a minute no way see Jesus Christ had not died how could you have the old new birth in the Old Testament when Jesus Christ had not died he could not come and live in us that away they had the anointing yes they had great things David could do all of the great things those mighty me and all kind of things could take place yes but still it didn't have the new birth you think David with all that what he could do what if he'd had a new birth you don't never thought Samson well he could do what if he'd had the new birth oh man he wouldn't worry about taking on ten thousand then why sometimes he he didn't care all right but you get the point now what I'm trying to bring the Old Testament could type and shatter examples that's what the Old Testament solely is all the way through is the examples and then you get over into where is it Ezekiel then you get over into those you've got examples of coming forth in as a new birth position but it could not come forth me there was no way to bring that new birth until Jesus Christ had died so as we read to our in Galatians that he was made of own made under the woman to redeem them that were under the law that they might be the children of God which that didn't make them the children of God in the Old Testament I Drive that point hard because you cannot bring those things into understanding you've got to wait until the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes all right and that's it would come forth into that position then you can start thinking about things as they begin to grow and what takes place and then you'll see why the scripture speaks of the way that does me and why Paul would give the scripture to go through that the air as long as he's an air he's fine but he's not positionally placed so we need to get into the Bible and study it not to just read it for something I know I came through the Baptist Church I'm not throwing no stones I came through there I appreciate all of that all of those things and times but I learned from that that you don't just take the Bible and try to read it for your own concept you'll mess up every time you try to put it into the position to where you can have some understanding and I tried back then to do that because that was my idea excuse me for having to put in a cough drop but that's all part of that coughing you know not the graveside all right but now listen as I said you had the two examples now in the Old Testament the birth and the authority but no new birth all right but Paul picks it up in the Galatians and begins to speak of something else to come Peter's picks it up in the in his in second Peter you know he picks it up and he begins to speak of something greater than for us to just be you know babies that God don't want us to be that and just stay that he wants us to grow up in him to where he can trust us right you don't put a novice you ever noticed it even to show you one example you don't have a novice to know just I mean in the New Testament writing there were one of those writers in the New Testament was tutored and brought to a position before they were given the right to write what they were to even drive all right so then that shows that what's what God wants us to be all right let's see Paul went on to pick it up so we'll try to to just get to point to where we're at today so turn over to Roman's of course they can pull it up and we'll get into Romans and pull it up on the screen I want you to see from this that there's three stages in this adoption that you deal with instead of just the two instead it's just getting born you know born again her baby or even the authority even the position even God trusting us to be like Peter and Johnson silver and gold have I none what's it in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk well ladies reach down and get a million C's they had come to the position that they had the authority with God Paul could say that you'll be judged by my gospel now what about a man like that you realize we're gonna be judged by his god you realized the world's gonna be judged by the the gospel of the Apostle Paul that's what he said and he said if anybody comes and brave anything one Gleason's 1:8 that right he comes and brings anything contrary to what I brought didn't let him be accursed that's something it what about a man with that kind of authority then when he spoke it God honored it and brought it to PI's all right but now let's get into this will this picture caught up from from this to try to cover three stages of adoption all right instead of just two instead of just of a two stage two were you birth and then position we're gonna get into another stage it's gonna cover a real good point those sorts right where everything is that so look at the Scriptures are now Romans 8:14 where as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God that's wonderful it if you're a child of God you're led by the Spirit of God you have the Holy Spirit the new birth that you've received and watch what he says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit of adoption all right see not all together than one but you'll have to have to have a place to start your new birth is where you start your adoption right same as the Old Testament the child born into the family in the New Testament the child born into the family by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where you start your journey that gives you the spirit of adoption are the holy spirit of adoption it gives you that to her that you can can have a lot of things and not watch what he says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit how long could we stay on talking about the Holy Spirit bearing witness in you you ever had him to do that you ever had him to tell you something before it took place you ever had him to direct you into something or tell you to go a different way then once he went going down the highway you know and you turn to go the other way come find out you get home and they had all kind of wrecks over on that road see that's that Spirit of God directing you through your life to direct listen and tutor us and carry us home to bringing us to the right place right the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit the Holy Spirit will bear witness with your spirit if you really got the Holy Spirit that spirit within you and I need to or just your natural see taste filled smell hear type of for more memories God it's the deeper meaning of the Holy Spirit coming to each one of us in our lives to guide us and to keep us into all of it the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now back to where we were in the message a moment ago he wants you children to act like you you know that's what God wants God wants his children to act like him right that's the very purpose that way we can know by the speed that's what dealing with us whether we're the children of God or not if we live like the devil whose children are we if we act like the devil we must be the child of the devil that's why I love what is in Galatians five we're talks about the one of them says the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness and all huh but it's the other one says the works of the flesh there's a lot of difference in the works of the flesh and the fruits of the spirit it's the fruits of the Holy Spirit but it's works of natural flesh that doesn't work too good okay now listen now and if children what's how Polly begins to coming forth to to cover the toward the nature part of of God to be instilled into us to bring us to what God wants and says and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ what am I then yeah I never read that well read it and see what about to be an heir of God right because that new birth the new birth makes you an heir of God and it even makes you heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ and here's one that's hard for us to swallow some time to think that God wants his children to be so much like him and he makes them joint heirs your heirs of God called you receive eternal life God alone gives eternal life right and he gives us eternal life that makes us joint heirs with Christ not that Christ is another person we don't believe in trinitarianism we're not that we believe in one true and living God Almighty God he gave us his nature who does none of the reasons you cover it with cross is the point to where Christ is that r19 are the anointed that comes within you to live in you all right so look and if children if we're the children of God look what we have no there's no if we read everything correctly you know I'm 79 years old we're anything correctly a few years from now I kind of Python well if my family is my family and I love all of them equally then it will be divided equally what I have what because there'll be errors me by being born into the family will make them errors but what about being born into the family of God to make you heir of God are with God and it makes you join a hair's join tires means there's a society right plain language right it's the same what about all born-again Christians are the same now all true born-again Christians are the same one because they have the same God living within them and their heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ what if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together alright now that's the point we like the other we want the heirs we want everything he's got we want to be healed we wanted me deliver one two but we don't want the afflictions and things that goes with being a Christian right ain't none of you want to be sick no we want to be delivered we want to be well all right come on this little point listen if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for our reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us the little banner afflictions that we long you know I'm so down and out and I'm so there's no being sick it's being sick right but see you can take my wife for an example she's at home today oh she has pneumonia but now you tell me how many times she's ever met services before they we come to church if we're sick I thought that was the place we're supposed to be I didn't know we're supposed to go to the hospital no don't don't let us understand me we go to the hospital we believe in doctors we do medicine and everything right so don't misunderstand my language just get what I'm saying if you're sick where you go I went by my mother for one day and she said where you headed I said I'm headed to the church with the kids they're sick well then she going to the doctor I would take care of that second we're going to the church to be prayed for well a lot of times when church got prayed for it didn't have to go to the doctor right see if cultures what we believing okay now listen I reckon that the sufferings of this present time what about now if your join tires remember whatever he has you them but he suffered for you and I he suffered for you and I what's the problem was suffering a little bit for him you know I think saying we got to be sick to glorify God no no no you are going to be sick let's get that into your mind well now you're making that set in my mind and I'm gonna be sitting no I'm just telling it like it is you're going to be a sick eventually somewhere down the road but we don't have to go down the road looking for sickness right we believe in being protected but I ain't standing out here for the Train we don't go in those lines guard listen look for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God the earnest expectation of the creation that's what that word is creature creation you realize the world is groaning you realize the animals after being run over like I said you know train come down the road or a deer running across the highway or something and they're being killed their suffering their groaning wanting to be delivered understand how can it be done you say well I can't talk he can communicate pretty good with him I've seen deer do amazing things I've seen deer walk down there through the woods and starting to look at me and me sitting completely covered and everything in the book and look at me like wave hey I see you sitting up there something took care of them but look what is the creature our creation waiting for okay now back up where was that what stage one adoption went into the family the Old Testament people had that second stage with Ora T right now what's the third C we're picking up to another stage now we're in the scripture picking up to another stage what is that stage that the creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God where the creature was made subject are put under death and dying and all the livings and things like that see he was made subject to vanity not willingly not of his own self but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope but the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God I love to hunt I love to see the animals and watch them and I was sitting watching a squirrel one day and he jumped on this big old tree beside of me and he went up that tree and he went a good 50 feet out up that tree and all at once he just sprung off and he went sit and about ten foot off the ground there was a limb sticking out and he goes to bloom to blow this walks down off of that I cried I said there cried I said God could I trust you enough to jump out the top of that 50-foot tree see there one day they'll be delivered there won't be no more hunting in the millennium won't be no killings and doing be a wonderful thing the word death will be taken away but the point of getting at is what what's gonna cause that it tells you in plain language the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children go well we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now waiting for backup above there a few verses for what the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God children with authority sons and daughters join heirs with Jesus Christ and given authority to speak it speak a storm out of existence are speaking it rain speaking all kind of things take place you have never seen those things like that speak of the dead race you haven't been in that place well you've heard the story here how they're on two different occasions the same man God raised him up from today of course of our our very word calling his name that wouldn't me I haven't didn't have nothing to do with me that had to do with that point back over there of the joint Irish back up to where the join tires is in there if we have anything whatsoever he give it to us see if there gonna be anything in our life worth anything it's worth it okay waiting for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God the making known rolled up back down a little bit where we can pick up the the word says there you go see if you look that up that word manifestation it literally means a making known you know are declaring bringing out into the open revealing showing or delivering see the cold creation everything is waiting for the manifestation of the sons I say end daughters cuz that's not adding to the scripture of God all right but we don't believe that they're women know how no authority that's where you see you're just as wrong is to take the other side alright listen but waiting for something to happen waiting for God to be able to live among his people and to share his word isn't that the most marvelous thing that God would want to share his nature his beings but he wants us to be part of him in the word to be in us but coming on down to see there's your second stage the manifestation of sons of God all right Stage one is the new birth Stage two is manifestations of sons and daughters of God all right now there's another stage here the that if we look at it correctly we can see where we're at because that's where we'll be picking up the scene remember my thought remember the point that I told you last Sunday we're going to not be looking backward because that's the problem with us we're not going to be looking forward because that's our problem we're going to try to be realizing where we are right here now because it's fine to see tomorrow but we're not there it's great what has happened in the past wonderful opportunity to receive those things but yet we're not there we're we're right here now right we're right here now you start trying to call on the God that was back there come on or a god that was over will be over there he doesn't have to answer us but if you can make it present tense God he is a spirit not was whatever he is he still is whatever he was anywhere because that's what I like about the reason we don't want to look back and look forward because we're constantly moving science is constantly moving I was reading that yesterday where they've got some kind of a thing they said after all these years would atomic energies and things like that there was one little thing that they can't figure out they're working on it but you just think an age where we're out of all this stuff that we've gotten all the things that are taking place but they admit they got one little thing that they can't answer we'll get that to seasoning there's a mystery be the children of God has that little part already figured out because that's where we're going to you say well we've got it figured out yeah if science would just listen to us what do you think they are no but listen the world's waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters for God amen all right now we take only we keep going now we're going to another stage what because the creature itself shall be so she'll be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God those animals one day are going to be delivered to her that they will be with us for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now everything all that the 6,000 years of mankind is groaning and travailing waiting for something the Bible says in Hebrews there 11:40 they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on us you realize everything is waiting now let me say it as to the point of what we believe because we believe God sent a prophet and there was a time that he he turned around and spoke to these Hornets and they went back in her Nash he's seen a time that this bull was gonna come forth and kill him he told it to go lay down anyone laid down you know what nature saw its master just for a moment but that's not all of it that's got to be for us right that's got to be for us now come on listen and we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they now look at the great Apostle Paul not only nature not only all the other look at his cell not only they but ourselves also the great man the great Apostle Paul is waiting on something he's waiting on something to take place right look and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit right back where we started baby born into the family coming okay all right even we ourselves groan within ourselves what about the great man that he was the Apostle Paul yet he was waiting on John you know he's in the grave right now the Apostle Paul's in the grave right now right what's he waiting on me and you know what else would you be waiting home if we are to be the sons and daughters of the Living God if we're to be heirs or God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ if we're to have the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God among us then who's Paul waiting them he's waiting on us to call for it right add that little point Paul's waiting on us to call for it for what we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body all right now you can use that word wit as to witness and that's good to witness with what are you to witness what is this to happen waiting for the adoption to witness the redemption of our body I like to use it like this to wit to understand I'm saying the same thing now just to me it's just picks it up into a higher order but to it means to understand what is it we're growing within ourselves we right now we're groaning crying out dying with all kind of sicknesses and heartaches and problems lying waiting groaning within ourselves waiting for the adoption what is the adoption the redemption of our body right come on read it you say you ever - come in - no no just reading like that waiting the adoption the redemption of our body well my body's already redeemed no it's this in the process it was renamed rise and the day you got born again God laid a claim on that body that you're living in he later claimed on that to say that's mine right let's see there's still problems we're still dying but waiting the adoption to witness our to understand the redemption of our body what about it waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters of God to come forth right let me give you a couple of that adoptions great big ol long word about that loan but I'm writing or taking out a Scofield Bible to just show you how this lines up and then I'll give you the other I gave it to you the other day but he says adoption placing as a son is not so much a word of relationship as of position let's go field knew that cuz he could read it he said the believers relation to God as a child results from the new birth where is now the very act of God were by one already is a child there's a new birth and through Redemption from the law he's placed in the position of an adult's on he's brought up the spirit given the realization in the believers present experience to full manifestation of the believers sonship now listen awaiting the resurrection the what are we waiting on the resurrection what we're waiting on the change of these bodies what are we waiting on the translation of these bodies those people knew that now let me give you I love thee to have a Bible that I've read a lot out of and it's got 26 translations and I like to use it sometime and out of one writer said it this way longing for the adoption that shall ransom our body from its bondage that's one of your writers that's that's the early early Joe beans is the epistle of Paul another writer the 20th century New Testament awaiting our adoption as sons the redemption of our body see those writers knew that that's the translation I'm bringing that from their translations of what you're saying we will that's that's another Bible or whatever eagerly one of them says eagerly awaiting we're eagerly awaiting our adoption the resurrection the redemption of these bodies eagerly awaiting it see those writers knew what they were bringing it out from as we wait for full sonship in the redemption of our bodies full sonship what is full sons you wild reformed I was a sudden wondered morning in right then there's a growth development part of that right now redemption to this body cuz about my Bible says we'll have a body like unto his glorious body sonship deals with the three stages of adoption birth sonship in manifestation and now covering it into the resurrection and the change yeah that's why I told you a long time ago hey I quit looking for the coming of the Lord a long time ago because I found out by reading the Bible that the dead in Christ is gonna rise first so I need to look for the resurrection now when the resurrection takes place then the rest gonna take place the dead in Christ gonna rise and then we which are alive and remain it will be changed see we move in to the change in the body Berkeley Cooke says it like this as we await that write of sonship that involves our bodily Redemption Phillips of the New Testament translation says which we wait for the redemption of our bodies which well means that the lie that at least we have realized sonship in him now that's that's the scripture that your reading of Romans where it says Romans 8:23 from brought from other translations to show you they were all looking for sonship our sonship is dealing with our redemption of these bodies until these bodies are fully redeemed it's not worth anything waiting for the adoption everything is groaning the trees are struggling everything is taking place waiting for the redemption of our bodies I'm reading you some quotes all these years until now now listen to him the prophets in now we have the earnest of our inheritance now we have the earnest of our inheritance all these years something's been waitin you know what was waiting on Malachi 4 we know that that's easy but watch Malachi for behold I send you Elijah the Prophet you'll turn the hearts of the children back in time that has to take place before you can talk about redemption of these bodies was dying we're going by the grave but God promised us that he would send us the voice of Elijah to turn our hearts back to bring forth the message that would bring the redemption see we are waiting for the fullness of adoption that will take place when at the first resurrection salvation fully in the fullness of sonship see the Old Testament on the top - that's what I kept trying to lay that down now this evening we'll pick it up and we'll try to bring it on over into the dispensation of adoption there's got to be a dispensation or we can't fit in all right where's that dispensation what is it the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters of God we got that we understand that we understand that God sent a prophet in the last day to bring us the message well we've got that but he's waiting God's waiting on you and I adoption when he can pour his fullness into us and the things that we have need of well I just don't see it does that mean it's not there where would you be in the old days where would you be you know in the Bible times in time with Jesus well I just don't see it is that gonna change it they're gonna make it not true no somebody's gonna see it and they're gonna realize it but you're gonna have to realize it in yourself to start with are you gonna not have anyone else to realize all right the world is waiting on the sons and daughters of God to come into full maturity statue of a perfect land that's why I've been through these things we showing you what we have need of having a new birth is wonderful the manifestation of sons and daughters are making known of the sons and daughters of God what's gonna be the greatest makin known the day somebody steps through death right somebody's gonna step through death and say death where is your sting grave where is your victory just brush it off and walk right on through there won't be nothing there the end to say well I just don't believe that took place what about it come on musician what about it can you see my point the Old Testament let me review at one point where you'll make sure entreated I know I say a lot of things in it you get tied up wonderful wait a minute he said in the Old Testament you could only have the example of a son being born into the family then it could move into the second stage to her that it could be authority that the son could come forth and act like his father but that was only tops and shadows well when Paul picks it up in Galatians and Romans Peter in 2nd Peter is explaining what is taking place the headstone has not communist that's the words of the prophet you know what the headstone is reveal word that means there's something about the word that's we need to realize what took place well I've done told you what I'm doing I've done this and stood on it from the very beginning when those seals broke to the Prophet he saw Redemption when we see it by revelation we'll see Redemption well we don't get it reading Greer's almanac you know what I'm saying you don't get it that way you get it by going into the Word of God and searching it out and crying out to God to reveal it which went wrong with our thinking why are we not a eager to serve God let Stan I hope you'll just take what we've said and consider it Oh politely there are three stages then so what the New Testament added another stage to your addiction exchanger the body these old bodies are gonna be change they're gonna be renamed they're going to be resurrected don't be change and evolve on the twin mover die [Music] what about [Music] can we get it to be presentations now we will stay back there why I want to be here I don't want to leave that guy I want to be here [Music] I don't want to be over there either [Music] I wanna realize while taking brain right now that's the only way I'll ever get over there you'll never get over there without knowing where you are here what about it here's his [Music] anybody have a name y'all doors open to God [Music] make everything right we believe it in Jesus name Amen anybody you believe it I see these the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] [Music] you know what the scientist named and Revell puts everything parentheses right where we at what a day what a time [Music] they shake hands with one another to leave men with their services afternoon never waiting him coming home and all of the thing is prepped the Lord would bless a man you're dismissed father we just ask you to be with each one as we go our separate ways for a few minutes and come back in you guide us in Jesus you're dismissed [Music] you
