[0:00] that so he had to come to bring all this
[0:04] up and us last people
[0:08] to the complete work he didn't he didn't
[0:12] come to just scruple around he'd come
[0:15] for a reason right and that was the
[0:17] reason the restorative complete well see
[0:20] 40 1947 he preached the word first serve
[0:23] when he preached was what
[0:26] 1947 first recorded sermon was so he
[0:29] started right here and from 47 to 1963
[0:33] he preached it here
[0:34] in tight okay and type he preached to
[0:37] hear
[0:37] he thought he was finished remember
[0:39] spoken words original C 1962 he said the
[0:42] true word struck the Earth or Robert
[0:44] Plant the scene Billy Billy Graham plant
[0:47] seed and I plan to see but remember the
[0:49] holy spirit said pick up your pen and
[0:50] run he said as of yet yeah Malachi 4 has
[0:54] not been made known now it was not the
[0:56] first part of Malachi 4.
[0:58] remember the prophet Malachi 4 has to do
[1:01] two things number one go to Malachi four
[1:03] go to Revelation 10 7. that's why my
[1:04] brother Brown had to put them two
[1:06] together Revelation 10 7 was this coming
[1:09] down
[1:10] so that we have the ability to receive
[1:12] this
[1:13] so he had to put 10 7 Revelation 10 7
[1:16] with Malachi 4 because Malachi 4 does
[1:18] say
[1:19] restore the hearts of the children right
[1:23] to the fathers this was to follow
[1:25] children to the fathers
[1:27] okay
[1:29] because remember it was the fathers to
[1:30] the children's what John took the Old
[1:32] Testament fathers and brought them to
[1:34] newborn baby brought them you know in
[1:36] dispensation coming across then
[1:39] you come back around where the fourth
[1:42] Spirit of Elijah had to bring this
[1:45] restore back to here 47 to 63 but you
[1:48] can't throw away 47 to 63. you have no
[1:51] Foundation
[1:53] you just have this and you can't
[1:55] understand this without this
[1:57] this for well that's not really working
[1:59] in your life there's no way you can
[2:00] understand this we got to go sorry Fred
[2:02] well just hold it for next week
[2:06] that's why these are we have to do these
[2:08] people it's a recorder
[2:11] we're gonna read some things today
[2:15] what we're going to do is we're going to
[2:16] try it we I think we're okay and through
[2:19] with brotherly kindness that's going to
[2:20] be a hard one for everybody to grab a
[2:22] hold of but it is this the thing
[2:27] that this whole pyramid hinges on
[2:31] is if we don't come to brotherly
[2:33] kindness
[2:34] we can't come to the rest of it so as we
[2:38] come up
[2:39] and we see these virtues working in our
[2:41] life
[2:46] let's start this
[2:48] and we see them working in our life we
[2:50] got to come to brotherly kindness and I
[2:52] want to
[2:53] mention something to you today for you
[2:54] to think about
[3:01] all right in every age
[3:04] okay in every age everybody got me every
[3:08] age
[3:09] Paul we know for sure do we say well the
[3:11] first church age
[3:13] are they even actually the first three
[3:14] Church ages
[3:16] had the faith of the fathers which is
[3:18] right here
[3:20] got it everybody got that everybody
[3:22] understand that
[3:24] this is the faith of the fathers James
[3:26] says contending for the faith that was
[3:28] once delivered to the Saints
[3:30] Peter said Silver and Gold Have unknown
[3:33] Paul casting out Devils we see those and
[3:36] I like what that brother said Wednesday
[3:37] night I really enjoyed it that was good
[3:39] if you weren't there you better listen
[3:40] to it that's right twice right because
[3:43] he brought out some really good things
[3:45] one thing he brought out was about gifts
[3:50] gifts are not to be leaned on as a
[3:52] positive identification of where you are
[3:54] that's right gifts are given to you like
[3:56] a gift like a gift God gives you a gift
[4:00] and you open it and what it does is a
[4:02] surprise or it's something to enhance
[4:04] your Christianity not to say that you're
[4:07] a Christian right right I love that and
[4:09] I've never seen it that way before to it
[4:11] to explain it to somebody and you know
[4:13] brother random around about what he did
[4:15] explain after the Pentecostal but he
[4:16] really didn't say hey this is to enhance
[4:19] your Christianity not to say that you
[4:20] are a Christian because gifts and
[4:22] callings are without repentance but if
[4:25] you're a god-called person and God gives
[4:27] you a gift that's God working
[4:30] in you and through you with a gift right
[4:33] because remember
[4:35] Caiaphas had a gift
[4:38] he was black inside
[4:40] right he went to hell but he rejected
[4:44] the word he killed the word actually but
[4:46] he also prophesied that was a gift that
[4:48] he had that he could enter into Balaam
[4:51] had a gift that he could enter into
[4:53] speak to God he knew how to get an
[4:55] audience with God he knew how to make
[4:57] the right sacrifice be new and you know
[5:00] what it wasn't uncommon
[5:02] that he would get an audience with God
[5:05] right right so he had been getting an
[5:07] audience with God for a long time but
[5:09] that's the gift that he had that if he
[5:12] would have used it right
[5:13] then see let's just put it this way for
[5:16] an example if he would have been a
[5:17] born-again Christian he couldn't turn
[5:20] the word down like he did if Caiaphas
[5:21] would have been born again God in his
[5:24] soul see God would have used that gift
[5:26] and also he would have used the gift of
[5:28] the Holy Ghost then he would the gifts
[5:30] that went on top of that that would
[5:32] enhance your journey and I love what the
[5:34] brother said because that's what he
[5:35] meant if he didn't say that in words he
[5:37] meant that he it enhances your journey
[5:39] it doesn't prove your journey
[5:42] speaking in tongues don't prove you got
[5:44] the Holy Ghost right but speaking in
[5:46] tongues if it's a prophecy to somebody
[5:47] it's God using you to help somebody else
[5:50] right which is what
[5:52] virtue
[5:53] say so the first church age the first
[5:56] church age had these gifts and I want
[5:59] you to look now remember brother round
[6:01] and he'll explain and will not read it
[6:02] but right before this explanation
[6:05] brother Brown talks about looking at the
[6:07] pyramid on the back of a dollar bill
[6:09] the capstone's not on it even the
[6:12] pyramids in Egypt is not caps on them
[6:14] they're flat there's no there's no top
[6:17] or head on it all right because remember
[6:19] Jesus was rejected he was the headstone
[6:24] he was the head of the church
[6:26] so this is his head this is his body
[6:30] okay
[6:31] this is adoption
[6:33] this is not
[6:37] right this is not Paul wasn't adopted
[6:40] that's right but Paul was right here
[6:44] now you received the spirit of adoption
[6:46] right here right
[6:48] right right where you cry out by father
[6:50] our daddy daddy I'm crying for my daddy
[6:53] right here but you're not crying up here
[6:54] right you're speaking right you're
[6:58] speaking the word here this is what is
[7:00] What God Says now see remember on the
[7:03] River Jordan
[7:04] God identified who his son was not had
[7:08] become or already he was already a son
[7:10] but his identification came on the River
[7:12] Jordan
[7:13] the anointing for his ministry came and
[7:15] he preached for three and a half years
[7:17] well that man was this total pyramid
[7:23] right that man was this total pyramid
[7:26] even because he was the head of the
[7:27] church right The Headstone came
[7:32] in Jerusalem in April in a Manger
[7:37] right Born of a virgin
[7:41] say we and I know and I know it's right
[7:44] listen but brother Branham and brother
[7:45] Bill always quotes that he became the
[7:47] force of the godhead on River Jordan
[7:48] well I showed him a quote to other
[7:49] neighbor brother Brown said he was born
[7:51] the fullness of the godhead he was born
[7:53] because he couldn't he couldn't he could
[7:57] not gain any attribute
[7:59] God don't gain attributes right right
[8:01] that's right he grew into those
[8:03] attributes
[8:04] just like you do see that's the same way
[8:07] you do you don't have those
[8:09] attributes at your natural birth sure
[8:12] you may have some of these naturally but
[8:13] like brother Tim says like I said these
[8:15] are god-given these are nothing man you
[8:17] can't go to school you can't go to class
[8:19] and learn this in a university that's
[8:22] right just a School of Hard Knocks is
[8:24] the only way you're going to get these
[8:26] right right right right right
[8:31] yes if he was all the attributes he grew
[8:34] he grew and to me Jesus was not a dual
[8:38] person don't get me wrong you hear me
[8:40] he's not doing he's not two people right
[8:42] but there was a human part of Jesus not
[8:47] separate when he had to contend with the
[8:49] things on this Earth God never had to
[8:51] contend with the things on his earth
[8:52] like Jesus did when he was born a baby
[8:57] remember I told you though that
[8:58] Melchizedek stepped into a body spoke to
[9:01] Abraham
[9:03] turned into them Sada and went right
[9:05] back out of existence well he didn't go
[9:06] through life as a child he didn't have
[9:09] to eat sure they fed him a calf but he
[9:10] didn't have to Jesus had to eat Jesus
[9:13] had to breathe and all those things why
[9:16] that's what he chose to do
[9:20] God made his choices
[9:22] yep but he makes the right ones first we
[9:26] make choices and may make the wrong one
[9:28] first but he makes the right choice
[9:30] every time right so the you know what he
[9:32] said well I'd have done it a different
[9:33] way well no no you wouldn't if you was
[9:36] God that's exactly the way you'd do it
[9:37] the way he came but he had to come in
[9:40] human flesh to be our brother
[9:43] born a baby
[9:46] Holy Ghost
[9:48] was in him he was the Holy Ghost it's
[9:51] not that he it's not that he received
[9:53] the Holy Ghost he received an anointing
[9:54] for his ministry which is part of the
[9:56] Holy Ghost see remember you received
[9:58] baby form by father down here
[10:01] right baby baby daddy daddy I'm crying I
[10:04] need something because I don't have
[10:06] enough of these virtues to get into the
[10:08] Bible or get into the prophet's message
[10:10] and say oh that's what they're saying oh
[10:12] that's what that's meaning oh that's the
[10:14] way I'm supposed to live right
[10:16] if you don't see this in the journey
[10:17] like I was talking about the other day
[10:18] with Abraham if you don't see yourself
[10:20] in Abraham's Journey then you need a new
[10:22] birth I mean you just need to be born
[10:25] again you need to go back and say God I
[10:26] need to start right here
[10:28] when Abram was called out Abram was
[10:31] called out and you know what Abram came
[10:33] out he moved he was always moving always
[10:37] going somewhere all right so baby form
[10:41] Faith this same holy spirit is down here
[10:43] but this Holy Spirit here is not the
[10:47] same as this Holy Spirit here in you
[10:49] that's right as far as manifestation the
[10:53] Holy Spirit doesn't change ever
[10:55] he was the Holy Spirit that said let
[10:57] there be
[10:59] all right the Bible even said Jesus
[11:01] Christ created all things right so that
[11:03] was the Holy Ghost back in the back and
[11:05] back part of God's mind coming out
[11:07] speaking let there be
[11:09] right so Jesus didn't have a different
[11:11] Holy Ghost that's where people get these
[11:12] female Holy Ghost and male holy ghosts
[11:14] and two Lords and two this and do that
[11:15] no God was one God was Jesus Christ God
[11:18] all night all right there wasn't no
[11:20] other attribute somewhere else
[11:23] our Jesus would have displayed it all
[11:25] right so everything we need for our
[11:27] Earthly Journey God gives us at the new
[11:30] birth down here baby form Faith that's
[11:31] when you are born again and like I said
[11:34] before it happened in my journey it
[11:36] happened in Abram's Journey God was just
[11:39] giving him stuff
[11:41] he was just he was just if he say hey
[11:43] give a thing now sometimes you cry
[11:47] that's right yes
[11:50] and he says
[11:56] don't you know
[11:59] don't you know
[12:01] that you got to go through this
[12:04] right
[12:05] and this right
[12:08] see that's what don't you know
[12:10] that you got to go through these things
[12:12] most people in the message don't know
[12:14] that you got to go through this you've
[12:15] got to go through this to get even to
[12:17] get to where you can be raptured change
[12:22] of the body now remember truly down here
[12:25] you can be born again you're just a
[12:27] Eternal as God is that don't mean one
[12:29] thing you're boring me you're going in
[12:32] the rapture but you're not going to take
[12:34] a change of the body down here that's
[12:36] right right
[12:38] now or Paul would have took the change
[12:40] of the body right here
[12:42] that's why this message is so important
[12:45] because this message in its totality now
[12:48] listen to me and it's not just 63 to 65
[12:50] in its total form is this
[12:53] because remember
[12:56] this was rejected and it's not come
[12:58] right okay that's why there's no head on
[13:01] the pyramid again say that again
[13:03] can you say that again Jesus came this
[13:07] is Jesus
[13:08] I wish I had that I saw one time there
[13:10] was a statue of perfect man uh picture
[13:13] with Jesus imprinted in here with his
[13:16] head right there
[13:18] and I can't find it anymore so if
[13:19] somebody finds it let me know all right
[13:22] but this is Jesus Jesus was born he was
[13:25] the fullness of the godhead Bobby he
[13:27] didn't have to be taught now listen in
[13:29] his Humanity had to be taught to walk
[13:31] and deliver that's his this outside man
[13:34] not a different man but this outside
[13:37] flesh had to learn how to walk and how
[13:40] to learn how to go to the bathroom he
[13:41] wore diapers just like her babies do he
[13:43] wasn't if he was any different than a
[13:45] human he could not die for the human
[13:47] race okay
[13:49] brother Brown said he was tempted in all
[13:51] points what about Mary Magdalene
[13:52] remember he lived with me if not he
[13:54] didn't listen uh no he didn't live with
[13:55] Mary Magdalene he lived in the same
[13:57] house because remember all him were
[14:00] together Lazarus Mary Magdalene Mary
[14:01] Morrison all in they were all together
[14:03] that's right well she was a prostitute
[14:05] don't you think he saw some things that
[14:06] maybe
[14:07] Roger you know tweaked his senses
[14:10] because he was a human but remember
[14:12] the Denver said me and you and me and
[14:14] him is is that I will as a human
[14:18] as a human and not born again I will
[14:20] entertain those thoughts and continue
[14:23] with the thought somebody understand
[14:24] that but see now with the Holy Ghost you
[14:27] can't help those knots coming but what
[14:28] you do is you do just like Jesus that's
[14:30] right yeah that's right you do just like
[14:33] Jesus did those thoughts will come he
[14:35] just
[14:38] the prince of the world is coming he has
[14:40] nothing in me well now what did that
[14:42] what's that good to tell you he will
[14:44] come
[14:45] right the prince of this world has come
[14:47] what in other words what the prince of
[14:49] this world Satan has come to Jesus
[14:52] and tempted him
[14:54] but he said he has nothing in me yeah
[14:57] I like what a good attempts at last week
[14:59] he said uh I'm a Christian I don't do
[15:01] them things and it kind of helps you in
[15:03] your mind I'm a Christian album that's
[15:06] right
[15:06] because the thoughts are going to come I
[15:09] I don't and that's where a lot of you
[15:11] have this battle you have this battle
[15:12] that no one having evil thoughts and
[15:14] then I'm evil
[15:16] this is the Devil's Playground he is
[15:19] allowed by the Fall to come into this
[15:21] thing right here yes right
[15:24] because remember Eve let him in here
[15:26] first right
[15:30] special cases all aside
[15:33] male and female you must process in your
[15:36] mind what you're going to do next
[15:41] now sure somebody says well I reacted
[15:43] and didn't think no
[15:45] no you there was a process there
[15:47] somewhere and like you know like male
[15:50] and female men and women you get the
[15:52] thought up here before the act happened
[15:54] right you have to get this thing going
[15:57] right that's what Eve did she got this
[15:59] thing going Satan got in this thing
[16:01] instead of this he couldn't get into her
[16:03] heart remember she was born she's not
[16:04] born again but she had to hold it up
[16:06] right she had she had an eternal life in
[16:08] her soul so they couldn't get to this he
[16:10] got to this
[16:12] and remember what she done was she
[16:15] reasoned on the word because she wasn't
[16:17] Maybe
[16:19] had all these working remember because
[16:21] brother Brown said she took her Human
[16:23] Side her feelings emotions Satan knew
[16:27] that part was weak
[16:30] you know I was thinking something the
[16:32] other day
[16:34] we talk about free moral agency let me
[16:36] tell you how Free Will agency works
[16:39] here you've got only two people on the
[16:42] Earth Adam
[16:43] and eat right right at that time when
[16:46] they were walking in eternity when they
[16:48] were walking in the garden in other
[16:49] words maybe not an eternity but walking
[16:51] in the garden there was no time right
[16:53] God would come down every day and talk
[16:56] to Adam and Eve is that right that's
[16:57] what the prophet said both of them not
[16:59] just one both of them
[17:01] Now Eve one often did what she did why
[17:03] didn't God
[17:05] Adam being a son
[17:08] why didn't Adam go
[17:11] be careful son your wife's fixing to do
[17:14] something wrong he couldn't do that
[17:16] that's right three more right absolutely
[17:20] so don't tell me that the Primo agency
[17:22] is gone in the end time that's what a
[17:24] lot of people say well you don't have
[17:25] three more life you just always was
[17:28] Adam Adam God if it was me God I said
[17:32] Adam
[17:33] be careful tomorrow your wife's fixing
[17:35] to do something you know God knew what
[17:37] was going on because I knew when he
[17:39] created him what they were going to do
[17:40] but he couldn't influence Adam
[17:43] he had to let Adam make a human choice
[17:50] absolutely right
[17:52] absolutely to display what was in God
[17:55] God always wanted to save somebody
[17:59] because he was a savior he always wanted
[18:01] to save somebody he always wanted to be
[18:04] the one that that comes and brings
[18:06] somebody out of something
[18:07] that's what a savior is right when you
[18:09] save somebody in the water what you do
[18:11] is you go down to where they are pull
[18:13] them up out of where they are and put
[18:15] them in the boat our problem is we jump
[18:16] out of the boat sometimes to get back in
[18:18] the water
[18:21] that's justification justification is
[18:23] that you know you're ready God will
[18:24] bring you out but you know you jump
[18:26] right back in but now when you receive
[18:28] the Holy Ghost when you come back out
[18:29] you're not going to jump back in yeah
[18:31] that's right but during your journey you
[18:32] may jump back to water a few times so
[18:34] just a little cute little analogy there
[18:37] but to display the attributes to display
[18:40] the attributes he had to allow Adam so
[18:42] look brother Brown said whatever he gave
[18:44] adam he gives you
[18:46] that's right so it's your choice but God
[18:49] knowing your choice by your free moral
[18:52] agency and everybody
[18:54] there's no way that God could allow
[18:57] somebody to go into heaven because of
[18:59] their own merits and their own thoughts
[19:02] and their own
[19:05] ideas that were in listen I'm not
[19:07] finished that were influenced by God
[19:11] nobody understand that because if God
[19:13] influences Bible says Bob you got to be
[19:15] this you gotta
[19:17] and then he doesn't this person over
[19:19] here say me
[19:21] right and then I see him standing at the
[19:23] wife don't judgment judging that's right
[19:24] not being judged
[19:26] and my thoughts are why did you go do
[19:29] that God and why did you not do it to me
[19:31] but no at the at the Judgment God's
[19:33] going to say
[19:34] Tuesday August the 24th 1973 I came to
[19:39] you yeah and you turned me down you know
[19:41] what that person's thoughts gonna be
[19:44] yes he did
[19:45] but I've shared my conscience so much
[19:48] I've got so far away from God I don't
[19:49] remember that but God that's to me
[19:51] brother Brown said God is just the Bible
[19:54] says God is just and to be just he had
[19:58] to give you a free moral agency right
[20:00] right now you'll hear Brother Brown say
[20:02] you didn't have anything to do with it
[20:05] I agree with that but you got to put it
[20:08] in the context of what he's speaking
[20:09] that's right because if we didn't have
[20:11] anything to do with it
[20:13] he did choose this one and not choose
[20:15] this right and that's unjust right right
[20:17] a judge can't come in and be unjust he's
[20:21] going to go by the laws that he set
[20:23] forth himself right
[20:25] so everybody it doesn't matter if it was
[20:28] from Adam all the way to the end time
[20:30] that's right has been given this free
[20:33] moral agencies
[20:36] he does by foreign
[20:46] remember you didn't have anything how
[20:50] many of us had anything to do with
[20:51] getting us here
[20:54] your Mom and Daddy got us here by
[20:56] yeah
[20:58] having an act
[21:00] and one met one and here you come well
[21:04] now that is the problems of God but like
[21:07] I've always said God knew when you got
[21:09] here
[21:11] that you would want it
[21:13] more than Joe blow out here I don't want
[21:15] to say that Joe Joe Jones or whoever
[21:18] so he had it waiting for you sure then
[21:21] he gave you an angel at Birth he knows
[21:23] these things but we don't
[21:25] see if we knew the end from the
[21:27] beginning we'd probably all go crazy yes
[21:29] wouldn't we if we knew the end from the
[21:32] beginning see that's where God knows all
[21:34] things he knows if he dumps on us all at
[21:36] one time
[21:39] Jesus is the only one that can handle
[21:41] this all at one time
[21:43] right that's right because he wasn't
[21:45] born of fornication he wasn't born of
[21:46] sin that's right he's born right
[21:54] the first time we need to be born the
[21:57] second time to get born right okay so
[22:00] let me finish this somebody else have a
[22:02] I just wanted
[22:05] you know me but I I was wondering what
[22:07] those attributes that he had as a young
[22:09] child he was probably a tender little
[22:11] boy
[22:12] he didn't feel no I think he threw
[22:14] roxions
[22:22] he's got a human side
[22:33] no Jesus Christ is the baby got whip
[22:37] yeah I'm just because you did didn't you
[22:40] you had to know what it was like
[22:42] delicious
[22:45] but now remember the Bible says he grew
[22:48] in Grace and knowledge right he was made
[22:51] perfect by the things he what there's
[22:54] your scripture right there if he didn't
[22:57] suffer
[22:58] why suffering doing something wrong
[23:00] right we suffer because we do something
[23:02] wrong our backside gets flattened and
[23:06] hopefully it connects to the brain
[23:08] and I believe no actually I'm sorry I
[23:10] don't believe that I believe he was a
[23:12] boy
[23:13] right up to being a boy I believe he you
[23:16] know played with you know sticks and
[23:18] stones and yeah he probably pulled the
[23:20] girl's hair and if he didn't he wouldn't
[23:22] know what to be if God made anything any
[23:25] more special
[23:27] then you beside being almighty God
[23:31] then he's got to come back as a
[23:33] different person nobody understand that
[23:34] yes he had to come by because you know
[23:37] people say well and that's what people
[23:39] in the message are saying they said well
[23:40] Jesus wasn't perfect because the Bible
[23:41] said he was made perfect by the things
[23:42] he suffered no he was made complete
[23:45] right exactly he was born with this the
[23:48] fullness of the godhead Bible
[23:50] okay that led him and got him guided him
[23:54] but he had a human side
[23:57] he had a human side now I'm not saying
[24:00] he had human nature but he had a human
[24:02] side
[24:03] that would allow him to get angry in a
[24:06] temple and run the people out to grow in
[24:09] Grace and knowledge
[24:12] and it says and favor with men so yeah
[24:15] he was a proper child I believe when he
[24:16] got older
[24:18] but when he was a kid he was just
[24:19] kidding he was just a kid you know he
[24:22] run around with the kids and I just
[24:23] believe he did kid things because
[24:25] remember even listen let me prove that
[24:27] even when he was 30 years old
[24:30] John the Baptist
[24:33] who was his first cousin
[24:36] did not know he was the Lamb of God
[24:38] right he had played with him I just read
[24:40] that quote the other day brother said
[24:42] God Jesus and John the Baptist played
[24:45] together and John never knew who he was
[24:48] so he was not so special
[24:50] now remember the Bible says John was
[24:52] filled with the holy ghost from his
[24:54] mother one
[24:55] so he was a special child not special
[24:57] you understand what I mean but but the
[25:00] Bible says he was born for a purpose
[25:02] remember he was real young and went out
[25:04] in the desert himself but remember
[25:06] he played with Jesus Christ himself
[25:09] and probably that day when he said
[25:11] Behold the Lamb of God because remember
[25:13] the Bible says
[25:15] that John he told John said John whoever
[25:18] you see the dove
[25:21] descend and remain
[25:23] now remember I believe he saw these
[25:26] other kind of fish and all these other
[25:27] priests remember they would always come
[25:28] and they were questioning I believe he
[25:30] could see the Holy Spirit go on those
[25:32] people but not remain yeah yeah because
[25:35] the conference the Holy Spirit would
[25:37] come on confidence and he would prophesy
[25:38] Holy Spirit would come on confidence and
[25:40] he would take the sacrifice in for the
[25:42] Year and God would honor that
[25:44] but the Bible says the Holy Ghost would
[25:46] come on and remain so he probably even
[25:49] saw Jesus he probably saw an anointing
[25:51] come one day
[25:54] and he said well
[25:56] it's not leaving yeah
[25:58] this must be the man
[26:01] that's why I told him in that crowd he
[26:02] said behold in other words look finally
[26:06] the Lamb of God has made itself known
[26:08] this is the man right here
[26:10] and I believed in John's in John's
[26:13] Humanity he said
[26:15] I've been beside him all along
[26:17] and didn't know who he was
[26:19] now tell me
[26:22] tell me that he will differ from that
[26:24] now Jesus was not different Jesus went
[26:26] through every form and condition we went
[26:28] through but without sin
[26:31] you and I are sinners that's right our
[26:34] nature is so close like Tim said our
[26:36] nature is so close to a beast nature
[26:38] because remember that's what came into
[26:39] the fall was the Beast nature that Beast
[26:42] nature came into the human race yeah
[26:45] right and it doesn't brother Brandon
[26:47] said without the Holy Ghost you're just
[26:48] a brute beast that's right you have a
[26:51] nature that's Fallen well see Jesus
[26:53] didn't have that nature to deal with but
[26:57] he was remember when he came into this
[26:59] world when he was born into this world
[27:01] he was born in Satan's domain
[27:04] he got older so he was he was he was uh
[27:08] susceptible
[27:12] to to everything that was in this Fallen
[27:15] condition even though he's a child
[27:17] listen you are you not born again right
[27:21] well you don't look any younger than 10
[27:22] years ago that I saw you
[27:24] because this is a fallen condition but
[27:27] inside of me is eternal man
[27:30] that this 18 years old 20 years old
[27:33] that's the Paradox in the end time or
[27:36] all the way through actually is that God
[27:38] can indwell somebody and they still look
[27:40] old even Jesus that's why the scribes in
[27:43] them had a problem with this man they
[27:45] thought the Messiah was going to come
[27:46] like brother Brown said walk up to the
[27:48] temple yeah
[27:49] and live like a monk I guess you know
[27:52] you know no thoughts no bad nothing but
[27:54] they would watch Jesus he'd go ahead and
[27:55] talk to a prostitute
[27:57] they call him a wine they called him a
[27:59] wine Bearer he must have drank some wine
[28:03] he was a common man
[28:05] that there was no difference in him and
[28:07] me and you during his life except when
[28:10] he walked onto that River
[28:13] Brown said bears were God identified
[28:15] where he was
[28:18] so that was his identification brother
[28:20] Brown calls it this coronation day
[28:22] where God didn't give him the Holy Ghost
[28:24] to make him God he was all where he died
[28:27] but he got an anointing for his ministry
[28:29] so that now truly all these things are
[28:32] working in that man's life to its 100
[28:34] percent do you understand what I said
[28:36] 100 because that's what we got to come
[28:38] to we got to come to this right here
[28:41] Martin Luther
[28:43] I believe there's people on Martin
[28:44] Luther's age that come to Bubbly Commons
[28:47] but not adoption no one has reached
[28:50] adoption except Jesus brother Branham
[28:52] and the people in the end time is the
[28:54] only people that's why I said I told you
[28:55] the other day real narrow up here at
[28:57] stop
[28:59] a lot of people born again down here
[29:01] and Through the Ages Paul irenius Martin
[29:04] all these Great Men brother Branham
[29:08] come to this place and had to come to
[29:10] this place before the next step comes
[29:12] that's what we were going to get into
[29:13] but we don't have time but we'll talk
[29:15] about this Holy Spirit next Sunday
[29:17] the Lord willing and then me and Bob
[29:19] both are going to be gone so
[29:22] um
[29:24] you want to do it on the what fourth
[29:27] fifth October 5th
[29:30] I'm gonna be in Mobile Alabama preaching
[29:32] for a little brother Matthew Bray and
[29:36] um tagging along
[29:38] he's gonna sing special he's gonna be
[29:40] George Beverly Shea
[29:42] so anyway
[29:46] right here it's where every Christian
[29:48] began since the day of Pentecost
[29:51] the 3 000 downstairs started right here
[29:53] now the 120 upstairs had been tutored by
[29:56] this headstone
[29:58] see because remember he said I will draw
[30:00] all men to me draw
[30:02] right right I'll draw them in not just
[30:05] as a new birth not just calling it
[30:07] neighbor but I'll draw because look if
[30:09] if God was here
[30:11] somebody's got to be here to draw right
[30:15] so Jesus had to be here he had to be the
[30:17] full expression of God the headstone
[30:20] remember when it was rejected then from
[30:23] then on
[30:24] all down Through the Ages you had that
[30:26] was that was all it would come everybody
[30:29] understand that
[30:31] now sure you get Divine love down here
[30:33] but it's not the fullness remember this
[30:36] is a headstone this is a this is the
[30:38] pyramid in itself
[30:40] but remember this pyramid can't be
[30:42] complete without that pyramid yeah got
[30:45] it see that's not a true pyramid
[30:48] but that is right that's a true pyramid
[30:51] what but you put the two together he's
[30:54] the head he controls the body
[30:57] so the Lord Jesus on on Mount
[30:58] Transfiguration
[31:02] brother Brown said it was now
[31:04] this is my beloved Son whom I please as
[31:06] well hear ye him it brings it down to a
[31:10] point all right on Sunset Mountain I
[31:12] believe that's the same thing happened
[31:13] to brother Brown brother Brown was took
[31:16] it up on a mountain
[31:18] took on the mountain
[31:19] a cloud Roselle's talking about a cloud
[31:21] of witness well that's our cloud of
[31:23] witness right there that cloud that's
[31:25] our crap that's our greater cloud of
[31:26] witness
[31:27] but brother random came to this because
[31:29] he had to come to this before you and I
[31:31] can come to him somebody had to there
[31:33] had to be a first group they had to be a
[31:34] first partaker so he first partook of it
[31:37] Jesus number one then
[31:40] run around them but now you and I could
[31:42] get a body change you got to be up here
[31:44] we can't take a body change right here
[31:47] there's nobody changing this because
[31:49] remember all those people are dead
[31:51] right there's only a few people that's
[31:52] going to reach that right there and even
[31:54] the ones that reach there have died
[31:58] Jesus died
[31:59] brother Brown died
[32:01] so there's got to be a special anointing
[32:03] in the end time that puts all this
[32:04] together
[32:05] reason brother Brown couldn't take a
[32:07] body change because I wasn't here yet
[32:10] the body is not complete without
[32:13] you
[32:17] oh yeah
[32:19] go ahead I thought Freda had her hand up
[32:20] she had her hand up because you had your
[32:22] hand up no I had my hand up okay
[32:24] um
[32:25] that's what people don't understand why
[32:28] Prophet at the time they had that's
[32:30] right
