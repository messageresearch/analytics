[19:04] see
[19:08] thank you Lord
[19:13] zombies
[19:37] foreign
[20:40] thank you
[20:47] my shoes on my feet foreign
[22:07] good evening amen I don't know how I get
[22:11] Rebecca and Rachel but I do that
[22:13] everywhere I go my grandma used to call
[22:16] my mother
[22:17] Martha her name was Alberta and
[22:21] she called my aunt Alberta and her name
[22:24] was Martin and I thought she was trying
[22:27] to cause a problem between them but I
[22:30] found out later in life is that what
[22:32] that wasn't the way it was amen let's
[22:36] try about about the G baby
[22:40] ain't got good
[22:44] already
[23:33] already went
[23:47] away
[25:09] you know like I said this morning
[25:12] um
[25:12] it seems like every message I pick up
[25:15] here lately it has to deal with the new
[25:17] birth and I know when I came last night
[25:20] to the little bible study that they were
[25:22] doing they were talking about
[25:24] sanctification which is a part of that
[25:26] new birth right and so I know they've
[25:28] been teaching justification
[25:29] sanctification baptism all in a person
[25:32] absolutely coming and dwelling in you
[25:34] that's what it is exactly it seems like
[25:36] every message and I mentioned it this
[25:38] morning if it be transformation where
[25:39] something changes right right where it's
[25:42] the statue of a perfect man where you
[25:44] can't even start up here until you have
[25:46] the new birth right and then I've been
[25:48] reading here lately in The Invisible
[25:50] Union amen and basically it's the same
[25:52] thing right it's a new birth there can't
[25:55] be a union without a birth do you
[25:57] understand that so just it seems like
[26:00] everywhere now it talks about the new
[26:02] birth I think probably one of the most
[26:04] misunderstood uh should I say I don't
[26:08] like to use the word doctor because it
[26:09] almost sounds negative in some ways but
[26:11] the most misunderstood doctrine that
[26:13] there is around the message of the hour
[26:15] is the new birth and I believe there are
[26:18] many many people who do not understand
[26:20] it that's right I believe there's many
[26:22] preachers in the Pulpit who haven't
[26:24] experienced it exactly can I tell you
[26:27] that because if they've experienced it
[26:29] they could you know like I said this
[26:31] morning if a woman says she's got the
[26:33] Holy Ghost and cut her hair remember
[26:34] Graham said the Holy Ghost will let you
[26:36] touch your ear sister that's right so if
[26:38] you got the Holy Ghost how can you
[26:39] spread a strange Doctrine out there
[26:41] because if you got the Holy Ghost in you
[26:43] it would he wouldn't let you do that and
[26:45] so when you see these ministers and I
[26:47] see it many places who come up with
[26:49] these strange doctrines as you one thing
[26:51] comes to my mind no numeration how could
[26:55] a preacher actually teach polygamy when
[26:58] brother Bram said and the seed is not
[27:00] air with the shuck polygamy is actually
[27:02] adultery right exactly is that right so
[27:06] we know you can't be an adulterous woman
[27:08] and be married to Jesus Christ but yet
[27:10] they'll preach a Doctrine like that and
[27:12] spare it out on the congregation so it
[27:14] pretty well identifies who they are so
[27:17] you know but I've been preaching a
[27:18] little series out of invisible Union I
[27:21] usually don't go somewhere else and in
[27:23] the middle of what I've I'm not even
[27:24] through at the series yet what I've
[27:26] decided to do is take the book of
[27:28] Corinthians both books and Minister on
[27:30] it and I really believe if you look at
[27:32] the books in Corinthians first and
[27:34] second you know brother Graham said
[27:35] Redemption is two parts right out of and
[27:39] into go look at First Corinthians and
[27:41] second Corinthians just bringing them
[27:42] out of and into it okay and it's a
[27:45] separation is what it is there's what a
[27:48] lot of people in the message of our have
[27:50] not come to as a separation so what I
[27:53] want to title this sermon tonight is a
[27:55] water of separation and put a friend
[27:58] there and I'm going to put a sacred
[28:00] trust right and if you lead an invisible
[28:03] Union brother Branham talked about a
[28:05] sacred trust that every woman is endowed
[28:08] with did you know that and a woman types
[28:11] the church we know that brother random
[28:13] said that is that correct so as a church
[28:16] God has given you a sacred trust is what
[28:19] he has given you and his expectation is
[28:22] that you're going to keep that trust
[28:24] does everybody agree with that and
[28:26] brother random when he talked to about
[28:28] the women see God gave the women and I'm
[28:30] going to be kind of playing Avail is
[28:33] that right and God expects you to keep
[28:35] that Veil right until you're married
[28:39] does everybody understand that so and
[28:42] Eve in the garden God entrusted her with
[28:45] a holy Veil right is that right but what
[28:48] happened was she traded that Holy Veil
[28:50] for a lust that
[28:53] this is what started us on the road of
[28:56] where we're at in this house that we're
[28:58] in right right so I just want to kind of
[29:00] talk about that tonight if I may if you
[29:02] would let's go to uh
[29:05] Romans 7 and 1. if you would I'm gonna
[29:08] read it out of the invisible Union can I
[29:10] amen you know brother Ram said this was
[29:12] his Thanksgiving message kind of an odd
[29:14] one don't you think
[29:16] but this was absolutely brother
[29:18] branham's Thanksgiving meeting let's see
[29:21] the date on it and this is way down the
[29:23] line he's just about off the scene here
[29:25] 65 11 and 25. this was brother Ram's
[29:29] last
[29:30] Thanksgiving message that he gave right
[29:33] that's right kind of odd to preach it
[29:35] out of Romans 7 1 don't you think
[29:38] let's read
[29:40] know ye not brethren okay for I speak to
[29:45] them that know the law
[29:47] how that the law has dominion over a man
[29:50] as long as he liveth for the woman which
[29:54] has a husband is bound by the law to her
[29:56] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[30:00] husband be dead she is loosed from the
[30:03] law of her husband right so then if
[30:06] while her husband liveth she is married
[30:08] to another man she shall be called an
[30:12] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[30:15] she is free from that law
[30:18] so that she is no adulteress though she
[30:22] be married to another man wherefore my
[30:25] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[30:27] law
[30:28] by the body of Christ that you should be
[30:32] joined or should be married to another
[30:35] even to him who is risen from the dead
[30:39] that we should bring forth fruit
[30:43] under God
[30:45] for when we were in the flesh
[30:48] motions of sin which were by the law did
[30:52] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[30:54] unto death right
[30:56] but now
[30:57] we are delivered from the law that being
[31:00] dead wherein we were held that we should
[31:04] serve in the newness of spirit and not
[31:07] in the oldness of the letter
[31:10] that's about our heads dear heavenly
[31:12] father we pray that you'll Quicken your
[31:13] word to us O Father Lord we love you
[31:16] with it with every fiber of our being oh
[31:18] God and we pray now Lord that you'll
[31:20] come on the same we know you're here
[31:22] Lord because we brought you here be with
[31:25] us now break the words of eternal life
[31:26] to us and we ask these things in Jesus
[31:28] Christ's name amen you may be seated
[31:32] you know I was reading this uh book here
[31:35] the other day I started reading it after
[31:37] I'd done the the uh series on the Feast
[31:40] of uh or the statue of a perfect man I'd
[31:43] actually did the feast days went through
[31:45] them then I did a stature of a perfect
[31:47] man and then I I had a bunch of books
[31:49] there that I'd gotten out I thought I'm
[31:51] gonna go to 65 and read some there you
[31:53] know and I can't this book kept
[31:55] shuffling to the top and how I kept
[31:57] getting there I don't know and I was
[31:58] sitting there in my chair one day and I
[32:00] said well there it is again and I
[32:02] thought maybe the Lord's just you know
[32:03] and I don't believe in Ouija boards by
[32:05] the way okay I don't do that but this
[32:08] kept coming to the top and I said well
[32:09] Lord I said well I'll just read the book
[32:12] and if you've got something you want me
[32:13] to bring the people of course we read a
[32:16] book and we've got two messages right
[32:17] but if there's something that you want
[32:19] me to get to the church right now then
[32:21] you break it for me and then I'll
[32:23] Minister on that and I thought well I'll
[32:25] Minister one service well then I
[32:27] ministered two three four I'm up to five
[32:29] now and I've actually gone through a
[32:31] series and like I and like I say I'm
[32:33] going through the booker Corinthians and
[32:35] I don't know if you understand
[32:36] Corinthians or not
[32:38] the Church of Corinth is actually a
[32:41] Greek Church did you know that the
[32:43] Corinth church is 50 miles from Athens
[32:45] is where it's at to the West it was a
[32:48] city that was on an isthmus they call it
[32:50] which is a land bridge between the
[32:52] peloponnese and between the main uh land
[32:56] of Greece so Sailors would come in there
[32:58] and what they didn't want to do they
[33:00] didn't want to sell around these
[33:01] peloponnese islands because there's
[33:03] hundreds of them it made their Journey
[33:05] like 200 miles out into rough seas and
[33:08] they'd have to come down to back around
[33:09] to deliver their cargo so what they do
[33:12] they come up to Corinth they would
[33:14] unload their ships and then they go load
[33:16] them on another ship to complete the
[33:18] journey so they wouldn't have to make
[33:19] that 200 mile circle through rough Seas
[33:21] is the way they did it
[33:23] but to just let you know Corinth the
[33:25] Church of Corinth was founded by Paul
[33:28] does everybody understand that the
[33:30] Church of Corinth was founded by Paul
[33:33] so and then the Church of Ephesus we
[33:36] know he was a pastor over there right we
[33:38] know you know he was a church age
[33:39] Messenger to Ephesus Paul
[33:42] so he was he actually started the
[33:45] Ephesus Church he started the Corinthian
[33:47] Church and it was five years before the
[33:50] the the the books of Corinthians were
[33:52] written that Paul established them now
[33:55] we know that when Paul established the
[33:57] church he put him on the faith right I
[34:00] mean that's what Paul that was his part
[34:01] of faith I told the church if you think
[34:03] Paul didn't have faith he took 195
[34:06] Stripes he was thrown over a long left
[34:08] for dead you better have some faith if
[34:10] you're going to go through that is that
[34:12] right so Paul lived his message of the
[34:15] hour Paul expressed faith if there's
[34:17] ever a man that showed faith that was
[34:19] Paul and he was a master builder he laid
[34:21] a platform is that right and you better
[34:24] watch how you lay on that so if you come
[34:26] and preach marriage and divorce any
[34:28] other way than what Paul preached it
[34:30] right you're cursed with the curse I had
[34:33] a man one time a preacher tell me and
[34:35] brother Wade he kind of laughs because
[34:37] sometimes we're on the telephone I had a
[34:39] preacher call me one time and he said
[34:41] well I want to come minister before yeah
[34:43] so that's I said and I asked him this I
[34:46] said you know and I'm like brother
[34:47] brother
[34:48] Samuel is a if you're an evangelist you
[34:52] better have a pastor or don't call me
[34:54] because if you can't stand under a
[34:56] Ministry I don't want you coming
[34:57] administering you understand it shows
[34:59] that you don't have leadership or you
[35:01] can't set it under a five-fold Ministry
[35:03] if you're an evangelist you need to have
[35:04] a home Church does everybody agree to
[35:06] that that's my number one rule for them
[35:08] number two you better be living this
[35:10] thing right and I asked him are you
[35:12] qualified
[35:13] well I learned to quit asking them if
[35:15] they're qualified because with their
[35:18] definition of qualified is and what the
[35:20] messages definition of qualified is is
[35:23] two different things and I asked him
[35:25] Point Blank I said are you called
[35:26] qualified he said well yes brother I'm
[35:29] qualified I said fine then come on I
[35:31] wrote him in on the day okay a week
[35:33] later I got a call from a brother that
[35:35] said you know this guy's in second
[35:36] marriage I said what I said I asked him
[35:38] if he was qualified he said yes
[35:41] so I called him up I said brother you
[35:43] know I asked you I thought how plain how
[35:45] much player could I be I guess you got
[35:47] to ask them are you double married
[35:49] so now I got to where I do that I
[35:52] thought you know you learn as you go
[35:53] when you're a pastor right right it's
[35:55] OJT it's on the job training when you're
[35:57] a pastor you hit all sorts of
[35:59] circumstances it's like wow now what do
[36:01] I do Lord help me that's what you do you
[36:03] get in prayer don't you and you say God
[36:05] here's a situation you guide me through
[36:07] it and he always does but anyway this
[36:09] guy man called preacher so I told him I
[36:12] invite him out and he told me when I
[36:14] told him I said oh brother you're double
[36:16] married I said I asked you if you were
[36:18] qualified he said but I am he said you
[36:20] need to go read marriage and divorce
[36:21] brother Branham brother Brandon changed
[36:24] that I said
[36:26] yeah brother I'm sorry but I don't quite
[36:29] get what you're getting at you know he
[36:31] said oh yeah brother Brandon yeah
[36:32] brother Brown made that clear he changed
[36:34] that he said you need to go read it
[36:36] because you know brother Brandon said
[36:37] we're going to have the same message and
[36:39] we are all right the trouble is when he
[36:41] was talking to me he let me know I was
[36:43] out because I didn't believe it just
[36:45] like he did that I that I didn't have
[36:47] the message he had the message right so
[36:50] anyway I went and I said I'll tell you
[36:51] what brother I promise you I'll read
[36:53] marriage and divorce and I'll call you
[36:55] back I read it two days later I called
[36:57] him back I said brother I don't get it
[36:58] I'm sorry I've read it and I said
[37:01] brother Brandon never changed the
[37:02] qualification right for the five-fold
[37:05] men do you agree he never changed that
[37:06] now what he did was he gave Grace to
[37:09] those out here and I told our church and
[37:12] I shouldn't say this because it almost
[37:13] they'll take you up on it yeah I told
[37:15] him I said I don't care if you've been
[37:16] married 18 times it's what I tell them
[37:18] it's kind of scary I really do care I
[37:21] was just trying to show him you know
[37:22] that God can forgive you for that amen
[37:25] for marriage and divorce we have the
[37:27] answer for it right when this message
[37:30] comes wherever you're at you remain as
[37:32] you are right right is that what he says
[37:34] you can't go out there divorcing it
[37:36] marrying and divorcing and marrying and
[37:38] nonsense has to stop right is that right
[37:41] is it nonsense has to stop it really
[37:44] does see I don't believe in really
[37:45] divorcement I believe in a death right
[37:47] because if you divorce somebody you
[37:50] bring them back for the occasion that's
[37:51] right is that right so the new birth
[37:53] ain't a divorce you understand I don't
[37:56] believe in Two Souls does everybody
[37:58] understand that because if you believe
[38:00] that then you believe in divorce right
[38:01] because you can bring the old man back
[38:03] anytime you want and a lot of them who
[38:05] believe that do
[38:07] right is that right usually they'll go
[38:09] out and get him another wife and she's
[38:10] always younger well yeah my pastor
[38:13] brother just said you know they they
[38:15] want if they want to do polygamy like
[38:16] Sarah and Abraham did let Sarah pick
[38:19] their wife he said I'd pick about a 400
[38:21] pounder
[38:24] about a 60-something-year-old lady and
[38:26] say there you go you want to do polygamy
[38:28] you go duplicate
[38:31] look at these stuff will stop there
[38:33] right we'll double out getting my
[38:34] teenagers what they'll do right so I
[38:37] mean they are they don't even practice
[38:39] it right if you're gonna do it do it
[38:40] like Sarah and Abraham did it right
[38:42] don't do it okay like I told you the
[38:45] story polygamy is actually adultery can
[38:48] we just call it what it is
[38:51] for we're not wondering now
[38:53] or somewhere compared into a rest we've
[38:56] got the answers right we have the
[38:58] answers the people of the message are
[39:00] now right but what I wanted to tell you
[39:02] was he had marriage and divorce so
[39:04] messed up I said well brother I can't
[39:06] bring you in here like that and so I
[39:08] just I just had to race him off my
[39:10] calendar sometimes brother Wade will
[39:12] call me and I'll tease him I go hear
[39:13] this
[39:16] I'm scratching him off my calendar you
[39:18] know so medium's got in an entire joke
[39:20] about it but you know hey you know if
[39:23] you mess up around me and you're a
[39:25] pastor I'm gonna go
[39:28] you understand because I believe you
[39:31] ought to be qualified to minister the
[39:32] gospel it's kind of like brother Howard
[39:34] Carroll said and I really like what he
[39:36] says he said if you've got on and meet
[39:38] him or me and my wife's gonna fly out
[39:40] and the guy the pilot sitting there was
[39:42] shaking my hands and said I'm not
[39:44] qualified to fly this jet would you stay
[39:46] on the jam now I guarantee I'd kick the
[39:50] windows out to get out of that yeah
[39:52] so you're going to get on a plane that
[39:54] this man's supposed to take you up here
[39:55] you understand he's going to fly you out
[39:58] of here because you can't go as high as
[39:59] your pastor did you know that and he
[40:01] ain't even qualified to fly the plane
[40:03] you got to be kidding me right exactly
[40:05] is that right so there's some things you
[40:07] know marriage and divorce brother
[40:09] Brandon preaching Romans but we have to
[40:11] understand that in order for a union to
[40:14] take place there has to be a separation
[40:16] right a water of Separation does
[40:19] everybody understand that something the
[40:22] old Nature has to to die do you agree
[40:24] with that the rule of a resurrection is
[40:27] without a death there is no Resurrection
[40:29] so something has to die and you talked
[40:32] about it this morning me and you that
[40:34] old adamic nature that you were born
[40:36] with and that adamic nature is from the
[40:38] earth it was a lust Veil that was put on
[40:40] you is that right amen that's what it
[40:43] was you were born under a lust Bell
[40:45] Brother Brad said your mother was he
[40:47] was eat Trinidad sure was because you
[40:50] were born in sin shaping iniquity come
[40:53] forth speaking lies is that right and
[40:55] once lust is is conceived at bringeth
[40:58] forth sin once sin is conceived and
[41:00] bring it forth death you understand so
[41:02] that's why you have to be born again if
[41:05] you're not born again you have not
[41:07] passed from Death to life right so
[41:10] invisible Union is all about a
[41:12] separation is what it is and the old man
[41:14] cannot be alive does everybody
[41:16] understand that if that old nature is
[41:19] not dead then you are not married to
[41:21] Jesus Christ because Spencer says if you
[41:24] have two living husbands you shall be
[41:26] called an adulteress amen an ill-fame
[41:29] woman does everybody understand that you
[41:32] are not be the bridal Jesus Christ if
[41:35] you've got a living husband right
[41:36] because everybody understand that so
[41:39] brother random in The Invisible Union
[41:40] what's he telling us again new birth
[41:42] right amen amen statue of a perfect man
[41:45] New Birth almost through 16 360
[41:49] freeways showing us what the new birth
[41:52] was it's like I tell people if you can't
[41:54] agree on anything else you agree on one
[41:56] thing something has to die all right
[41:58] something has to die and Christ has to
[42:01] be formed within you is that right there
[42:04] has to be a death that's the rule of
[42:06] Resurrection so as low as we understand
[42:09] that we're going to get somewhere now is
[42:11] that right so what we have to do and I'm
[42:14] going to explain to you brother Brandon
[42:15] said this was his Thanksgiving message
[42:17] is that right let me read a quote to you
[42:21] Hey Brother Branham I think you know
[42:23] he'll go on for a while then all of a
[42:24] sudden he says I haven't even got to my
[42:26] Thanksgiving message yet is that what he
[42:28] said listen to what he said
[42:31] you may say what's this all got to do
[42:34] with Thanksgiving
[42:35] it is pretty strange isn't it Romans 7 1
[42:38] right yeah seems like a strange
[42:40] Thanksgiving message but no it's not he
[42:42] did right on
[42:44] constantly these little when you see
[42:46] these little stories that's right and
[42:48] these little uh Parables that he's
[42:50] talking about in a book go back and look
[42:52] at the title again I constantly when I
[42:55] read it I say now this is the book what
[42:58] does this have to do with that if you'll
[42:59] keep going back and forth don't try to
[43:01] interpret it just let it interpret
[43:03] itself you'll see that that little
[43:05] Parable that he was bringing forth has
[43:07] everything to do with that title is that
[43:10] right amen it does it go look at it and
[43:14] really ask God to give you the
[43:16] revelation of it and you'll see that
[43:18] those Parables hooked right up with
[43:19] what's talking in okay but listen you
[43:21] may say what's this all got to do at
[43:23] Thanksgiving what are you talking about
[43:24] brother Branham here it is quarter to
[43:27] nine you didn't say nothing about
[43:28] Thanksgiving
[43:30] what a message for the occasion to me
[43:33] yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very
[43:36] thankful for their Newfound way of life
[43:38] a new life can I say it that way right
[43:41] right they left their own life and they
[43:44] came over to their new life does
[43:46] everybody agree with that
[43:48] at their old church of England where
[43:49] they couldn't Worship in spirit and in
[43:52] truth is right right they were so
[43:55] organized they couldn't worship the way
[43:57] they wanted to worship so what did they
[43:59] do they crossed over the water right
[44:02] amen into the new land the new life
[44:06] because everybody understand so what's
[44:08] rather than talking about water of
[44:11] Separation it's a water of separation is
[44:14] that right what is the water the word
[44:16] right that's the only thing going to
[44:18] separate you from your old life to your
[44:21] new life amen does everybody understand
[44:22] you're going to have to have the water
[44:24] the washing of the Water by the word is
[44:28] what's going to take you from your old
[44:30] life to your new life is that right and
[44:33] once you come over you ain't going back
[44:35] does everybody under saying that once
[44:38] you come to the new life you're not
[44:39] going to go back into the world of sin
[44:41] right so you can't have the old man and
[44:44] the new man does everybody understand
[44:45] this guy is gone there's a separation
[44:48] you know separation means death right if
[44:51] you look at the word change means that
[44:53] there's so many things like I say the
[44:55] rule of Resurrection is death right so
[44:58] you have to understand something has to
[45:00] die in order for Christ to be born in
[45:03] you is that okay
[45:06] the Pilgrim problems we're very thankful
[45:09] for their Newfound way of life being
[45:10] separated from the old English
[45:12] denominations and Creed they could marry
[45:15] to the new anointed
[45:17] anointed right they can marry to the new
[45:20] anointed the anointed word for this day
[45:23] right can I tell you that
[45:25] word for their age
[45:28] see Luther was married to the word of
[45:30] his age is that right he was he was he
[45:34] absolutely preached justification
[45:37] it was the message of the hour he was
[45:39] absolutely adjoined to that is that
[45:41] right it was the truth for that day so
[45:44] what what are we absolutely joined to is
[45:47] the word for our hour is that right
[45:51] and new anointed word of their age for
[45:54] their day
[45:56] see I'm not live I'm not eating on some
[45:58] old dead carry-on right is that what he
[46:00] said right I'm not eating on a a Mana
[46:03] for another day this is Mana that fell
[46:06] in our day so I've got eaten on carry-on
[46:08] I'm eating on the unfailing Bodywork of
[46:11] the son of man amen is that right that's
[46:14] what I'm eating on
[46:16] so can we be thankful as pilgrims
[46:20] Abraham was a pilgrim wasn't he did God
[46:23] separate Abraham
[46:25] God separated him didn't he he told
[46:27] Abraham said Abraham you get away from
[46:29] your kin folks son you come on out here
[46:31] I want you Abraham you get out here with
[46:34] me is that what he's saying you know he
[46:36] said separate yourself from your
[46:38] kinfolks really he brought him with him
[46:41] he didn't do God never blessed him until
[46:43] he fighted did he he never really
[46:45] blessed Abraham until he got away from
[46:47] his old daddy his old daddy brought
[46:49] Idols over did you know that
[46:51] a lot of worshiper He's a fly in the
[46:54] ointment his old daddy died out now he
[46:56] was getting somewhere then he had to a
[46:58] lot of him where they gave her they
[46:59] argued all the time so he had to
[47:01] separate himself from lot once he did
[47:03] that now God right to start blessing
[47:06] Abraham is that right now he could
[47:08] become the world made flesh the this
[47:11] right right we talked about it
[47:13] Melchizedek the word made flesh could
[47:15] now come to him right is that right
[47:17] couldn't do that until he had a
[47:19] separation you got to separate do you
[47:22] understand that all right you can't have
[47:24] two living husbands expect to be joined
[47:25] to Jesus Christ forget it it'll work
[47:28] that way we understand it right
[47:30] so can we be thankful as pilgrims like
[47:33] Abraham separated ourselves from the
[47:35] things of the world all of our
[47:37] Associates yo young people this is what
[47:40] I see one of the biggest problem in
[47:42] young people is they want the message of
[47:45] the hour but they won't separate
[47:47] themselves from their own friends right
[47:48] now I'm going to tell you if God could
[47:51] not bless Abraham until he separated he
[47:53] will not bless you till you separate
[47:55] because that old friend if he's got
[47:57] fleas you're gonna get fleas you
[47:59] understand
[48:00] now that's the truth whoever you run
[48:02] with that's the influence brother
[48:05] Brandon preached the message influence
[48:07] of another until Abraham come out from
[48:09] under the influence of another and God
[48:11] under the influence of Melchizedek that
[48:13] voice that he heard is that right then
[48:16] God could bless him at that point does
[48:18] everybody understand
[48:21] Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated
[48:24] us from all dead religions right I'm
[48:29] speaking Across the Nation now all the
[48:32] dead Creeds and to what separated us
[48:36] been open to us a new land
[48:40] a new message
[48:43] for this day for this day right okay now
[48:49] brother Brandon before he read Romans 7
[48:51] 1 I want you to see what he says
[48:54] it seems like it's on marriage and
[48:56] divorce but it really isn't to me it's a
[49:01] prophecy amen a prophecy for the church
[49:05] in the last day so this message of
[49:10] invisible Union is a prophecy is that
[49:13] right and I'm going to tell you you must
[49:16] be born again was never preached
[49:20] after Jesus preached it until this day
[49:22] by our Prophet does everybody understand
[49:24] that you show me where Luther Wesley go
[49:28] look at their writings you won't find
[49:29] where they use the title ye must be born
[49:33] again I think it was one of the
[49:34] Mysteries they didn't understand don't
[49:36] you they knew they had to be saved they
[49:39] couldn't explain it we can explain it
[49:41] next day we can explain what died this
[49:44] day if you understand is that right
[49:47] and so for you in order for you to be
[49:50] married to Jesus Christ that death has
[49:53] to come to that old nature does
[49:55] everybody agree with what I'm saying now
[49:57] that's what he said now I want to go
[49:59] back to the Old Testament okay and I
[50:02] think brother Wayne almost got on it
[50:04] last night I told him you need to be
[50:05] still his mama wouldn't even talk I
[50:07] wanted him to be still because he was
[50:09] hitting what I was going to preach I
[50:10] thought if he takes my fire I'm gonna be
[50:12] mad you know what I mean but that's okay
[50:15] I know and he about got on it I said oh
[50:18] boy I wish you'd be still man because I
[50:20] really believe one of the biggest
[50:21] problems around the message of the hour
[50:23] is there's many many many many many
[50:25] people with no new birth right right and
[50:28] we don't want to make it through such a
[50:29] mystery to you do you realize everything
[50:32] that you receive is a gift from God if
[50:36] you go in the book of adoption
[50:38] and that's the final State isn't it
[50:40] adoption that's it it's where your words
[50:43] are his words whatever you say it'll be
[50:45] that way you sign the checkbook he'll
[50:48] cash it you write the check right
[50:50] now that's what full adoption is
[50:53] it really is so you go in the adoption
[50:55] book you watch how brother Brown does it
[50:57] he preaches Saint John 3 16. and God
[51:01] gave His only begotten son so it's a
[51:04] gift does everybody agree you're right
[51:06] then he said he gave
[51:08] some gifts
[51:12] everybody following me then he said he
[51:14] gave some Apostles right I read that
[51:18] this morning there's a gift amen then he
[51:20] said he gave you the Holy Ghost
[51:23] what is it you got that God didn't give
[51:25] you right is there anything you've done
[51:28] to deserve it there's only one thing you
[51:30] can do exactly accept it
[51:33] Daniel 70 weeks a pardon is not a party
[51:37] unless it's accepted you know why we
[51:40] don't have more gifts working in the
[51:42] church people won't accept it right is
[51:44] that right accept it I tell the church I
[51:47] said I taught on all the gifts and gifts
[51:49] is just like this pyramid in my opinion
[51:51] Brethren didn't say as I said it but I
[51:53] can see it see that pyramid there I do
[51:55] this and what the the least of the gifts
[51:58] are speaking in tongues the
[51:59] interpretation right we know that God
[52:02] the restoration of the gifts is that was
[52:04] the Pentecost God restored this speaking
[52:07] in tongues does everybody agree with
[52:09] that put the cabbage down they
[52:11] denominated they died right there that
[52:13] didn't stop God one bit did it
[52:16] you didn't stop God one bit now we're
[52:18] going to go beyond that Beyond
[52:20] organization does anybody agree with
[52:22] that now we're not going to do away with
[52:24] the benign spiritual gifts but when I
[52:26] said you do away with an I am spiritual
[52:28] gifts you're living in a delusion the
[52:29] church is living an illusion right so we
[52:32] believe in the nine spiritual gifts so
[52:34] it comes up right one of them is
[52:36] knowledge does everybody believe in
[52:38] knowledge
[52:39] I think you ought to be an expert in the
[52:41] word don't you exactly it's a gift Glory
[52:44] it's a gift that God gives you these
[52:46] things you understand so you come up the
[52:48] gift of discernment right not like
[52:50] brother Branham had right now there's
[52:52] only one of those gifts per generation
[52:54] is that what he's saying well you know
[52:56] what the gift of German is to be able to
[52:58] judge right you know we'll sit here in a
[53:01] congregation we'll say I can't judge
[53:03] that brother you're the only one that
[53:04] can right that's right who are you
[53:06] kidding right see people around the
[53:08] message I said oh you can't judge him
[53:10] really
[53:12] you mean you got the Holy Ghost In You
[53:15] remember it's a judgment seat we see
[53:17] with blood on it it's a mercy say you
[53:20] mean to tell me I can't judge a matter
[53:21] in the church isn't that what Paul got
[53:24] on to the Corinthians form he said
[53:25] you'll take a brother to law you've got
[53:28] to be kidding me you're supposed to have
[53:30] these nine spiritual gifts working in
[53:32] your midst
[53:33] and you're taking a brother to court no
[53:35] you're supposed to have the gift of
[53:37] discernment it's where you can judge a
[53:38] matter is that right matter of fact take
[53:41] the person in this congregation that's
[53:43] the least esteemed among you not the
[53:46] greatest the least esteemed among you
[53:48] set them down in a chair you tell them
[53:51] your side they tell them their side lay
[53:53] it all out that person ought to be able
[53:55] to discern that that gift of discernment
[53:57] should be working in every local
[53:59] assembly is that right right so God's
[54:02] Building this thing up okay the gifts
[54:04] you the last thing he brings
[54:07] wisdom right wisdom is that right you
[54:11] know what come down in 1963.
[54:15] wisdom thank you all right now I'm gonna
[54:18] ask you what was the first message
[54:20] before brother random preached the seals
[54:21] what was the title of it
[54:23] God in Simplicity I told the church if I
[54:27] was going to use one word to say what
[54:28] Simplicity or what wisdom is it's
[54:31] Simplicity right exactly is that right
[54:34] because remember in the Corinthians Paul
[54:36] had to constantly correct these
[54:38] Corinthians brother Adam preached the
[54:40] message Corinthians book of Correction
[54:42] now book of correction he didn't correct
[54:44] them because he didn't like them right
[54:46] and he just wanted to look up on him all
[54:48] the time he put the book he loved them
[54:50] Paul loved them Paul established this
[54:53] church he wanted to see him move up and
[54:55] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[54:58] really what Paul wanted is that right he
[55:00] did preach it again
[55:02] or beat him down he's trying to get the
[55:04] nonsense out of the church the
[55:06] Washington
[55:07] that's what he wanted to get he wanted
[55:09] he want to do separate him from their
[55:11] own life that old damning nature that
[55:14] old sin is what he wanted to get out of
[55:15] your life is that right amen that's
[55:17] exactly what he wanted to do that's what
[55:19] brother Brandon was talking about the
[55:20] invisible Union right you have to
[55:22] separate yourself from that if you're
[55:25] sin you're still a sinner right exactly
[55:28] John just tell you that don't say you I
[55:31] get more people in my church
[55:33] they'll say I believe and they think
[55:35] that's it good Baptist Doctrine isn't
[55:38] that what it is well they said burn that
[55:40] before you come over into this just
[55:42] because just
[55:45] just trembles the devil believes this
[55:47] entire message did you know that's very
[55:49] most creatures I know right he's way
[55:51] ahead of the curve the devil right he
[55:53] believes every doctrine of this message
[55:55] of the hour and he trembles like I say
[55:58] that's pretty well beats most preachers
[56:01] on that right is that right so just
[56:03] because you say I believe the message is
[56:06] not it
[56:08] you
[56:10] have to have a separation the old fellas
[56:14] got to be dead that old nature that old
[56:16] nature it was a damning nature and it
[56:19] strived after the world of things the
[56:21] world can I tell you that that thing has
[56:24] to be dead d-e-a-d
[56:26] everybody understands and if it's no you
[56:29] are an adulteress right right isn't that
[56:31] what's happened over there in Revelation
[56:32] 7 said she was an adulteress right why
[56:35] because she takes the name of Christ
[56:38] says she's married to Christ and yet
[56:40] she's married to the world and the
[56:41] things of the world she's got her own
[56:43] wine her own Revelation that she hands
[56:45] out is that right now that's what she
[56:48] does now if you've got your own
[56:50] Revelation then you're nothing but an
[56:52] adulteress you understand what I'm
[56:54] saying so like I said you better not
[56:56] hand out any wine or your wine you
[56:58] better have his wine is that right but
[57:00] Revelation to the message of the hour
[57:02] because if you know you're just like
[57:04] that Harlot that's missing in
[57:05] Revelations no different is that right
[57:07] why she hadn't come to the New Birth is
[57:10] why exactly exactly right man and that's
[57:13] where the big failure around the message
[57:15] of the hour is is New Birth right no new
[57:18] birth that's right if you get a new
[57:21] birth you're going to get yourself right
[57:22] with God exactly amen okay and I don't
[57:25] care what you say your mouth can tell me
[57:27] all it wants to I believe the message
[57:30] you go to Ezekiel 36 what I was talking
[57:33] about when he said ye must be born again
[57:35] you look at the last scripture
[57:38] said and you do it right and do it ain't
[57:40] that the last words comma and do it if
[57:43] you don't do it you don't believe it
[57:45] it's that simple so I don't care if you
[57:47] were born in a message church if you do
[57:50] not
[57:51] occurred you're not there yet right amen
[57:54] okay now I'm not gonna give up on you
[57:56] all right Paul didn't give up on the
[57:58] Church of Corinth and I won't give up on
[58:00] people in my church either that's right
[58:02] but I have many of them to say I believe
[58:04] and I'll see about smoking a cigarette
[58:06] you got to be kidding me
[58:10] there has to come a separation do you
[58:13] understand
[58:13] what I'm saying you have to separate
[58:16] from unbelief
[58:18] bitter and sweet does not come from the
[58:20] same Fountain right now I'm telling you
[58:22] we're down here at the very end of the
[58:24] end and we need to quit kidding
[58:26] ourselves if you don't have a new birth
[58:28] in this church it's easy right
[58:32] just accept it exactly
[58:35] it's so simple you can't believe it
[58:39] is that right but it's foolishness to
[58:42] your coconut right to your intellect
[58:45] it's foolishness because it's too simple
[58:47] right yeah if that asked you a hard day
[58:50] you'd go do it right right but if I tell
[58:52] you to go dip in the river seven times
[58:56] and that Almighty Jordan you got to be
[58:58] there's a lot clearer Rivers down here
[58:59] in Syria let's go there no that's not
[59:02] what he said he said dip in Jordan right
[59:04] death right right you gotta be separated
[59:07] does everybody understand that so your
[59:10] whole new life is based on separation
[59:12] right does everybody agree with that now
[59:15] do you understand I'm not going to read
[59:17] the scripture I could but I I won't have
[59:19] time does everybody understand the water
[59:21] of Separation in the Old Testament
[59:23] that's right the Old Testament if you
[59:25] were in the church and you were a
[59:27] brethren
[59:28] you say I believe the message and then
[59:30] you go out and sin in the world before
[59:32] you come back into the congregation of
[59:34] the righteous you had to be cleansed in
[59:37] that water
[59:38] of Separation now do you know what went
[59:41] in that water right there was one when
[59:43] it was hissa that I talked about this
[59:45] morning does everybody understand that
[59:47] kiss up
[59:49] Cedar
[59:51] was the third one help me and Scarlett
[59:53] thank you I remember that so you got
[59:55] hyssa which is faith he's got to go in
[59:58] the water the word right if you don't
[1:00:00] have if Faith's not in the word you can
[1:00:02] forget it you don't get the separation
[1:00:04] is that right and again the same rule
[1:00:06] that I told you in the Passover was in
[1:00:08] the water of Separation you didn't take
[1:00:10] part of the hyssop and put it in there
[1:00:12] right when you burn it with the ashes of
[1:00:14] the red heifer is that right so I took
[1:00:16] the red heifer too so you had to take
[1:00:18] the whole Revelation the whole Faith
[1:00:21] right and you put it in and burn it with
[1:00:23] the red heifer right remember he said
[1:00:25] Lord I come in a volume of book he's the
[1:00:27] red heifer is that right Christ is the
[1:00:30] red heifer so for Waters of Separation
[1:00:32] they had a red heifer that was perfect
[1:00:34] right is that right a perfect absolutely
[1:00:37] perfect specimen of a red effort so they
[1:00:40] would slay that heifer they take it
[1:00:42] outside of the can and burn it is that
[1:00:44] right they had to have cedar cedar the
[1:00:48] wood Cedar is red and white right but
[1:00:51] they said the red is for the blood the
[1:00:53] white is for righteousness is that right
[1:00:56] so they put that on it then they put in
[1:00:59] the hyssop that I told you then they put
[1:01:01] the Scarlet but it was Lamb's wool right
[1:01:03] so it's Lamb's wool it's Scarlet brother
[1:01:06] Raven said that was Redemption sure and
[1:01:08] that went in there doesn't that pretty
[1:01:10] well tell you everything that's in the
[1:01:11] water of Separation right right so you
[1:01:13] gotta have all those things to actually
[1:01:15] have the water of Separation so when you
[1:01:18] go out in the world and you get the
[1:01:19] world of things in the world before you
[1:01:20] could come back into the congregation of
[1:01:22] Israel you had to have the water of does
[1:01:25] everybody understand that because you
[1:01:28] would absolutely if you brought suit in
[1:01:30] the camp
[1:01:30] then what happens is let me just be
[1:01:32] honest with you you bring adultery in
[1:01:35] that back door and you call yourself a
[1:01:36] brother yeah
[1:01:38] they were an Israelite is that right you
[1:01:41] call yourself a brother that you believe
[1:01:43] this message and you bring adultery in
[1:01:45] the back of that church
[1:01:46] there's going to be a preacher to take
[1:01:48] care of that that's right and I'm going
[1:01:49] to read that scripture for you in just a
[1:01:51] minute okay but the water of Separation
[1:01:53] you went out in the world and with that
[1:01:56] water of Separation what you could do is
[1:01:58] now you could come into the congregation
[1:02:00] of the righteous and worship with them
[1:02:02] exactly is that right until you did the
[1:02:04] water it even if you were a stranger a
[1:02:07] stranger you could do the water of
[1:02:09] separation and come into the
[1:02:10] congregation is that right but you had
[1:02:13] to have the water of Separation to do it
[1:02:15] exactly is that right the word isn't it
[1:02:18] the washing of the Water by the word
[1:02:19] amen you had to have it you've got to
[1:02:21] have the word do you understand you have
[1:02:24] to what's the Holy Spirit going to
[1:02:27] anoint his word all right man you ain't
[1:02:29] got no word in you and you say you got
[1:02:30] the Holy Ghost you got to be kidding
[1:02:32] amen right the only thing he can anoint
[1:02:34] is his word is that right that's the
[1:02:36] purpose of the holy spirit is to anoint
[1:02:38] his word and make it come to pass in you
[1:02:40] right it's you're written Epistles
[1:02:42] written red of all men is that right
[1:02:44] you're living like I said you're a
[1:02:46] dwelling Tabernacle of God right if you
[1:02:48] ain't got no word in your house God's
[1:02:50] Gonna Know It God ain't gonna anoint
[1:02:51] that right he's got to anoint the word
[1:02:53] is that everybody agrees with that it's
[1:02:56] every Baptist Church in America today is
[1:02:58] going to read the word is that right
[1:03:00] yeah
[1:03:01] man but it's not life-giving right they
[1:03:05] don't have the Holy Spirit to anoint it
[1:03:06] they don't have a message to do like the
[1:03:09] life for this day they don't have that
[1:03:11] to anoint it and bring it up do you
[1:03:13] understand what I'm saying and that's
[1:03:15] what brother invisible Union was what is
[1:03:18] it it starts with the new birth you
[1:03:19] don't have a new birth no Union exactly
[1:03:22] it's what it is okay that's right now
[1:03:24] I'm gonna read a scripture to you real
[1:03:25] quick if I can
[1:03:30] hold on
[1:03:36] numbers 25 and 6 if you want to turn
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:41] I want you to hear that so this is going
[1:03:43] to get rough on some of your toes I
[1:03:45] promise you when I get through you're
[1:03:46] gonna get scanned so I'm just warning
[1:03:48] you up front get ready take a deep
[1:03:50] breath don't get nervous
[1:03:51] that's the way I preach man when I
[1:03:53] preach I preach okay I know you do too
[1:03:55] I've heard brother Wade
[1:03:57] so I don't have to wonder what you guys
[1:03:59] preach too
[1:04:01] and behold one of the children of Israel
[1:04:03] now this wasn't an unbeliever folks this
[1:04:05] was one of the children of Israel do you
[1:04:07] understand
[1:04:08] could I say a message believer would
[1:04:10] that give you more understanding
[1:04:12] right came and brought into his brethren
[1:04:16] a medianized woman in a sight of Moses
[1:04:20] here's this guy this Jew this Israelite
[1:04:24] goes out and gets a strange woman and
[1:04:26] brings him right into the congregation
[1:04:28] of the righteous
[1:04:30] and he didn't go through the water of
[1:04:31] Separation now if they'd done the law
[1:04:34] right
[1:04:34] right is that right they'd have been
[1:04:36] okay but they didn't do that they didn't
[1:04:38] go to the war
[1:04:40] of the word so this brother thought he
[1:04:42] could go out and get him a strange woman
[1:04:44] bring it into the congregation of the
[1:04:46] righteous and everything would be okay
[1:04:47] not a good idea
[1:04:49] you understand now listen to what
[1:04:52] happened
[1:04:55] a median ice won't decided mode and in
[1:04:58] the sight of all the congregation of the
[1:05:00] children of Israel and listen to this
[1:05:02] who were weeping before the door of the
[1:05:05] Tabernacle of the congregation they were
[1:05:07] in church
[1:05:08] he brought it here they were in worship
[1:05:11] crying at the door of the congregation
[1:05:14] and he brought this strange woman in
[1:05:17] yeah
[1:05:19] is that Brazen yeah do you know the
[1:05:22] devil when he was in Hammond exalted
[1:05:24] himself up and get up against Michael is
[1:05:26] that Brazen you know what job when he
[1:05:28] said he walked up there didn't the devil
[1:05:31] walk right before the sons of God right
[1:05:33] before the throne
[1:05:35] he said hey he said what do you think
[1:05:37] about my servant job it's when you got a
[1:05:39] hedge around him man I can't get it to
[1:05:41] him take the heads down and I'll get him
[1:05:43] to curse you to your face but the point
[1:05:46] I want to make is the devil went right
[1:05:48] up to the throne of God
[1:05:51] did he not right you talk about Brazen
[1:05:54] there's people that say they believe the
[1:05:55] message is our they'll go out in the
[1:05:57] world and get him a strange woman with
[1:05:59] this message says don't you marry an
[1:06:01] unbeliever under no circumstance if you
[1:06:05] really believe this message of the hour
[1:06:07] you will not go out there and get you a
[1:06:08] strange woman does everybody understand
[1:06:10] this is going to be tough but I'm going
[1:06:12] to tell you you're not supposed to do
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] you're not now listen to what happened
[1:06:17] to this guy
[1:06:19] and when Phineas does anybody ever look
[1:06:21] up the name Phineas what that means it
[1:06:24] means brass mouth can I tell you what it
[1:06:26] means mouth of brass you got it I heard
[1:06:29] you chuckle I know you got it so what
[1:06:32] was it judgment right right you know
[1:06:34] where judgment comes from all right
[1:06:36] Phineas he was a son of a high priest he
[1:06:38] was a priest is what he was and he's
[1:06:41] seen that thing going on he knew they
[1:06:42] didn't fulfill the law right he wasn't
[1:06:44] going to let him get by was he this guy
[1:06:46] ain't gonna let you get by either you
[1:06:48] understand what I'm saying you go out
[1:06:50] there in the world and you pull those
[1:06:51] things off Phineas is going to come
[1:06:52] after you if you're a pastor a true
[1:06:55] Pastor you're not going to let adulter
[1:06:56] Spirit come in your congregation and
[1:06:58] drag your people out is that right
[1:07:00] because he's a shepherd and he's going
[1:07:02] to take care of his sheep does everybody
[1:07:04] understand that so what did he do
[1:07:06] Phineas a priest now I want to tell you
[1:07:08] something there were other priests there
[1:07:09] oh yeah why didn't they do anything
[1:07:10] exactly makes you wonder don't it
[1:07:13] he wasn't the only priest there why
[1:07:16] didn't they do something right right
[1:07:19] I've seen it in message churches they'll
[1:07:22] let that stuff go on Elite your church
[1:07:24] up it's like a cancer you can't let
[1:07:26] those things you can't let the world of
[1:07:28] things the world come into your
[1:07:29] congregation and not be a Phineas and
[1:07:31] kill that thing right it sounds tough
[1:07:33] don't it oh yeah but I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:07:36] go into some real detail with you here
[1:07:37] in a minute I'm using one example and
[1:07:39] then I'm going to get real ABC with you
[1:07:41] and break down the real simple part of
[1:07:43] this message where I believe the failure
[1:07:45] is coming from
[1:07:46] you understand where I believe the
[1:07:49] failure of this this around this message
[1:07:51] the message will fail this message I got
[1:07:54] is perfect you understand but that devil
[1:07:57] will walk right up in front of this
[1:07:59] he's he ain't got no he don't care he's
[1:08:02] Brazen in there he'll walk up before God
[1:08:04] I guarantee you he'll walk up before me
[1:08:06] in a congregation right right
[1:08:08] so phidius the son of Eliezer the son of
[1:08:11] Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from
[1:08:15] among the congregation so he was a
[1:08:17] priest he lived among the congregation
[1:08:18] is that what I said this morning that's
[1:08:20] what a pastor he lives among you he 'll
[1:08:22] put up with that nonsense
[1:08:24] and took a job
[1:08:25] to Japan
[1:08:26] and he went after the man of Israel into
[1:08:28] the tent
[1:08:29] this is the tent do you agree yeah this
[1:08:32] is the Ten right right see I'm not
[1:08:34] worried against flesh and blood right
[1:08:35] does everybody hear it was Flesh and
[1:08:38] Blood it was a shadow of things to come
[1:08:40] right is that right I'm not fighting
[1:08:42] against flesh and blood I'm fighting
[1:08:44] against the spirit of that thing I'm not
[1:08:47] going to let that Spirit come into my
[1:08:48] congregation and have a bunch of that
[1:08:51] get off on a bunch of people is that
[1:08:53] right see we can't allow that to happen
[1:08:55] what did he slay his enemies with a
[1:08:58] flaming sword where did it come from his
[1:09:00] mouth right it's a mouth of judgment do
[1:09:02] you understand so the pastor is not
[1:09:05] going to let things come into this
[1:09:06] congregation and not take care of it
[1:09:07] that's what we're supposed to do if
[1:09:09] you're a true Pastor you're going to
[1:09:11] take care of that thing in a hurry
[1:09:12] because you're not going to let get off
[1:09:14] on somebody else right is that right
[1:09:16] and he went after the man of Israel
[1:09:19] message believer man of Israel right he
[1:09:22] said he believed the message
[1:09:26] into the tent and thrust both of them
[1:09:28] through the man of Israel and the woman
[1:09:30] through her belly so the plague the
[1:09:33] plague was stayed from the children of
[1:09:35] Israel right is that right
[1:09:38] it's exactly right now then let's go to
[1:09:40] the book of Corinthians the first
[1:09:42] chapter
[1:09:43] this is what got me onto the message
[1:09:45] that I've been preaching for a while
[1:09:46] here let's go to
[1:09:48] Corinthians I said right
[1:09:55] not know it's everywhere again
[1:09:58] does anybody know what the word Corinth
[1:10:00] means
[1:10:03] it means ornaments glitter
[1:10:05] they had the glitter but they didn't
[1:10:07] have the glow does everybody understand
[1:10:09] brother bran said you got the glow not
[1:10:11] the glitter of Hollywood right the
[1:10:13] Church of Corinth if you look at the
[1:10:15] characteristics of the Church of Christ
[1:10:17] it's identical to the the spirit of
[1:10:20] laodicea it is absolutely this is what I
[1:10:23] did in our church and I'm going to do it
[1:10:25] now so you'll understand
[1:10:26] now it's the Church of Corinth or the
[1:10:29] Church of Ephesus I'm gonna draw a line
[1:10:32] and too bad you're on the left you know
[1:10:33] it's the Sheep on the right go to the
[1:10:35] left you just don't you just have to be
[1:10:37] on the wrong side but you can move up
[1:10:39] when I get through maybe all of you'll
[1:10:41] be sitting over here okay that's really
[1:10:43] what we want as a pastor isn't it we
[1:10:45] want all of you to be just like the
[1:10:46] Ephesian church to where you can take
[1:10:48] adoption where you take predestination
[1:10:51] where we can move you up into the statue
[1:10:53] of a per that's adoption up there is
[1:10:55] that right that's adoption at the very
[1:10:57] top there that's what we're taking you
[1:10:59] to that fivefold Ministry is that right
[1:11:02] exactly Statue of Liberty right there by
[1:11:05] giving you the word right that's where
[1:11:07] how we're going to get you there right
[1:11:08] let's go to Corinthians 1 and 1. Paul
[1:11:11] called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:11:13] through the will of God and sauce to
[1:11:15] these our brother
[1:11:16] unto the Church of God so he calls them
[1:11:19] a church right right he don't refer to
[1:11:21] these guys as bright yet yet
[1:11:24] okay now listen I wanted to get you how
[1:11:26] he really looks at these Corinthians
[1:11:28] which is that Korean to them that are
[1:11:30] Sanctified remember what you said last
[1:11:33] night brother so you guys been preaching
[1:11:35] the same thing I've been preaching it
[1:11:37] ain't no different I can't preach a
[1:11:39] different message Than You Preach right
[1:11:40] right I preach the same message you
[1:11:43] preach I preach the same message you
[1:11:44] preach the fivefold ministry is saying
[1:11:47] the same thing is that right I'll read
[1:11:49] it to you in a minute okay I'm back at
[1:11:51] up here shortly
[1:11:53] Sanctified I said their behavior was
[1:11:56] what was in question see what he had
[1:11:59] done when Paul got there Paul got him to
[1:12:01] justification Paul got into
[1:12:03] sanctification you know now brother
[1:12:04] random said Paul got him to the baptism
[1:12:06] of the Holy Ghost he had to leave him
[1:12:08] like Billy Graham did 30 000 would come
[1:12:10] up say make their confession brother
[1:12:12] random said Billy Paul preached
[1:12:13] justification did he Billy Graham did I
[1:12:16] say Billy Paul Billy Graham thank you my
[1:12:20] wife always corrects me I love it it
[1:12:22] don't bother me it don't matter who
[1:12:23] cracks me I love correction amen do you
[1:12:26] understand I love correction you really
[1:12:28] do
[1:12:30] if you're one of his you'll take
[1:12:31] correction see God don't correct the
[1:12:34] devil's youngins
[1:12:35] right he corrects his youngins is what
[1:12:38] he does okay
[1:12:41] it says their behavior was what was in
[1:12:43] question I got after I said Sanctified
[1:12:45] because sanctification is your behavior
[1:12:47] did you know that you're right is that
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:52] right it's behaving out here is because
[1:12:54] you ain't got something right in there
[1:12:55] right and that's what Paul was saying
[1:12:57] Boys you ain't got the baptism the Holy
[1:13:00] Ghost because if you had the baptism all
[1:13:02] the ghost you wouldn't be pulling these
[1:13:03] things right so what's he do he's going
[1:13:05] to take them back now
[1:13:06] he's gonna put him right back and
[1:13:08] establish them again and bring him up to
[1:13:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's
[1:13:12] the way Paul did it that's why brother
[1:13:13] I'm sitting here
[1:13:15] right to separate
[1:13:17] from Prophet things and dedicate to God
[1:13:20] to consecrate so if you ain't been
[1:13:24] separated then you don't have the water
[1:13:26] of Separation right you don't have the
[1:13:28] new birth does everybody understand that
[1:13:30] amen if you're still sinning it's
[1:13:32] because you're a sinner let's just be
[1:13:33] bold okay I'm gonna say some things
[1:13:36] that's going to kind of got to put your
[1:13:37] hair on in here a little later I'm
[1:13:39] building up to it but these things need
[1:13:41] to be preached because there's a lot of
[1:13:43] people in the message of hour sitting in
[1:13:45] churches have been told you believe the
[1:13:47] message of the hour recognizing your day
[1:13:50] in the faith when you receive your
[1:13:51] message of the hour that's it you got
[1:13:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost no if
[1:13:55] you've got the baptism you'll do it
[1:13:57] right so if you're you've got one quote
[1:13:59] you're not living under it yeah you're
[1:14:02] in deep trouble right right we're at the
[1:14:04] end of this thing now you better start
[1:14:06] checking up brother man said you better
[1:14:08] be prayed up check it up every hour
[1:14:11] every minute of the day to make sure
[1:14:12] you're right where you need to be
[1:14:14] because we're fixing to take a Rapture
[1:14:16] of body change does everybody understand
[1:14:18] so you better be sure that you're under
[1:14:20] your messenger and the message and the
[1:14:23] messenger one right so that's what you
[1:14:25] need to if you have the separation and
[1:14:28] it separated you from unbelief you'll be
[1:14:30] under your messenger but we have people
[1:14:32] all over the place 90 of the people say
[1:14:35] they're mentioned and they say they
[1:14:36] believe it and they don't have the
[1:14:37] separation because they're not I can see
[1:14:40] it they're not under the
[1:14:42] man is that right
[1:14:45] in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with
[1:14:49] all that in every place called upon the
[1:14:51] name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both
[1:14:53] theirs and ours Grace be unto you see
[1:14:56] Paul was a Grace preacher right
[1:14:59] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:15:01] since John come we preach Christ exactly
[1:15:04] is that right because if you preach
[1:15:06] Grace Grace will put you under the law
[1:15:09] you understand what I'm saying you'll
[1:15:11] fulfill the law can I say it Jesus
[1:15:13] didn't do away with all he fulfilled it
[1:15:15] right the Old Testament still works
[1:15:17] today Thou shalt not commit adultery now
[1:15:19] there's some preachers don't believe
[1:15:20] that
[1:15:21] but it still applies today does
[1:15:23] everybody understand right Grace be unto
[1:15:26] you in peace from God our Father and
[1:15:28] from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my
[1:15:30] God always on your behalf for the grace
[1:15:33] of God which has given you by Jesus
[1:15:35] Christ gift right everything look at the
[1:15:38] scripture every time it says gave given
[1:15:40] what is it that you've worked for
[1:15:42] nothing right it's gift everything's a
[1:15:45] gift just accept it accept salvation
[1:15:48] accept your gifts accept it just accept
[1:15:52] everything that God given you if God
[1:15:54] says this is you then why can't you
[1:15:56] accept it right he gave it to you just
[1:15:58] accept what he gave you right he gave
[1:16:00] you your healing just accept it like I
[1:16:02] said this morning ask God tell him what
[1:16:05] you need and then thank him for it just
[1:16:07] say thank you Lord and thank any foreign
[1:16:09] and now what Thanksgiving is exactly
[1:16:12] Thanksgiving thanks for giving me
[1:16:14] something right that's what that's what
[1:16:17] Thanksgiving is all about just thank God
[1:16:18] for what he already did for you all
[1:16:20] right
[1:16:21] that in everything you're enriched by
[1:16:23] Him in all utterance now I want you to
[1:16:25] listen to this these Corinthians that in
[1:16:29] everything ye are enriched by Him in all
[1:16:32] utterance
[1:16:33] and in all knowledge right now they knew
[1:16:36] the message of the hour they knew what
[1:16:38] Paul preached them that's what's
[1:16:40] happened around the message there they
[1:16:41] know the message of the hour and they
[1:16:43] can even utter it right they knew it
[1:16:46] they could speak it but they lived none
[1:16:48] of them right does everybody understand
[1:16:49] where we're going with Corinthians
[1:16:51] that's what you said last night brother
[1:16:53] Wade see they say he said they were
[1:16:55] Sanctified dangerous like brother Wade
[1:16:58] said it and I thought boy you got that
[1:16:59] right big boy he said when you're
[1:17:02] Sanctified you're on Dangerous Ground
[1:17:03] right you are you're just like the
[1:17:05] Corinthians were if you stay in that
[1:17:07] Sanctified realm you can fall off there
[1:17:10] you understand and that's where they
[1:17:12] were they could they knew the message of
[1:17:14] the hour they knew the quotes I can
[1:17:16] remember my pastor who used to tell them
[1:17:18] the color of the book The volume number
[1:17:20] the page number at the bottom of the
[1:17:23] left hand when you
[1:17:24] I told him one day I said you're not
[1:17:26] learning that for me
[1:17:28] because you can clothe it and the Holy
[1:17:30] Ghost In Me will amen right what you're
[1:17:32] learning that for is to argue with a
[1:17:33] bunch of preachers is that who you got
[1:17:36] to prove it to
[1:17:37] him he's a Moses who gave him problems
[1:17:39] on marriage and Wars the 70 preachers
[1:17:41] that came to him the brother man say it
[1:17:43] was the preachers that got married to
[1:17:44] divorced all messed up
[1:17:46] there's where your problem lies today
[1:17:48] it's the preachers who ain't got a new
[1:17:50] birth can I say it that way they ain't
[1:17:53] got a new birth they can't keep it
[1:17:54] straight but if you ain't got a good new
[1:17:56] birth you're not going to live it and
[1:17:58] you're dead you're going to preach me a
[1:18:00] sermon aren't you that's right that's
[1:18:01] the problem look at them some of them
[1:18:03] polygamist you got to be that's the new
[1:18:04] birth no no it's proof to me there's
[1:18:07] something a lot of preachers
[1:18:09] yeah
[1:18:10] I'm not down enough I'm drawing a line
[1:18:12] say okay you're over here with the
[1:18:14] Corinthians now get over here with the
[1:18:15] officials Paul didn't give up on them
[1:18:18] you understand he didn't give up on the
[1:18:20] Church of Corinth he said you where what
[1:18:22] I'm going to do is I'm correct you give
[1:18:25] them some love yeah and that wasn't
[1:18:27] Brotherhood said love is corrective
[1:18:30] correction is love right so what do you
[1:18:33] do he's going to correct the Church of
[1:18:34] Corinth and get him to move over here
[1:18:36] move them up so they'll come to the
[1:18:38] Church of Ephesians and they'll be ready
[1:18:40] to take a Rapture then right so that's
[1:18:42] what Paul was trying to do with the
[1:18:44] church of Korean you know what I'm gonna
[1:18:45] go back to the history for a minute drop
[1:18:47] back but the Church of Corinth what they
[1:18:49] said the history of it was the Church of
[1:18:52] Korean was what it was where the church
[1:18:54] is supposed to influence the world is
[1:18:57] that right right that's what you're
[1:18:59] supposed to do influence the world what
[1:19:02] happened is the world started influence
[1:19:04] the Church of Christ and what do they
[1:19:06] have coming in
[1:19:08] um
[1:19:09] exactly I mean go read the stuff they
[1:19:11] had coming into their Church idolaters
[1:19:15] does anybody know what brother Brandon
[1:19:16] said in our daughter was
[1:19:19] let me tell you what an idolater is it's
[1:19:21] different what you think
[1:19:23] you and our daughter is a guy will come
[1:19:25] sit right in here
[1:19:27] the message walk right back out and do
[1:19:29] nothing with it yeah right did you say
[1:19:31] that's what an eye doctor was
[1:19:34] so if you want to know that's what the
[1:19:35] church you could do or they were
[1:19:36] idolaters and he called them that right
[1:19:38] they come in they hear a good message
[1:19:41] does everybody agree they'd walk out and
[1:19:44] do nothing with it they wouldn't put
[1:19:45] Flesh on it right right like I said this
[1:19:48] morning do you understand if this man
[1:19:49] preaches a word and you get it down in
[1:19:51] your heart it's going to have Flesh on a
[1:19:53] thing you're going to Manifest this
[1:19:55] message of the highway if you don't
[1:19:56] you're an idolater right right that's
[1:19:59] pretty tough isn't it just because you
[1:20:01] come in here doesn't mean you got it
[1:20:03] right all right because remember Satan
[1:20:06] walked right up to the throne it didn't
[1:20:08] bother him one bit right right so just
[1:20:10] because you come right here to this
[1:20:12] Tabernacle don't mean you
[1:20:13] you got to get it on the inside of the
[1:20:16] inside you got to come to water
[1:20:18] separation where that old nature that
[1:20:20] old damning nature gets off of you and
[1:20:22] then it's Christ that's formed in you
[1:20:24] it's not me that lives it's Christ in me
[1:20:27] that liveth is that right that's right
[1:20:29] and if you've got Christ in you you're
[1:20:31] going to bring forth fruit all right
[1:20:32] correct is that right
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:38] where would I leave off
[1:20:40] oh utterance and knowledge
[1:20:42] and this is the one I told you even as
[1:20:44] the testimony of Christ was confirmed in
[1:20:46] you your testimony is the prophecy
[1:20:50] confirmed in you does everybody
[1:20:52] understand that Brethren just didn't
[1:20:54] preach a message to be to be preaching
[1:20:55] it brother Adam say this thing
[1:20:58] to your church he even said Brandon
[1:21:01] Tabernacle is not my church when he put
[1:21:03] that in that Cornerstone the Lord told
[1:21:06] him this is not your church is that what
[1:21:09] he said brother Brandon was not trying
[1:21:11] to build a church neither are we trying
[1:21:14] to build a church any true ministers not
[1:21:16] trying to build a church we're trying to
[1:21:18] build a living Tabernacle for a living
[1:21:21] God is that right that's what we're
[1:21:23] trying to build here tonight right amen
[1:21:26] so we have a testimony if you don't have
[1:21:29] a testimony
[1:21:31] that prophecy hadn't been made flesh
[1:21:34] there is that right that's right because
[1:21:35] the testimony is the result of the
[1:21:38] prophecy so the preacher remember I said
[1:21:42] preacher means Prophet would this guy
[1:21:44] preaches the message if that don't take
[1:21:46] Flesh on it and you don't bring a
[1:21:48] testimony forth that absolutely unions
[1:21:52] with what he said that it shows you
[1:21:54] don't have a new birth do you understand
[1:21:56] because it means you got two husbands
[1:21:58] and you shall be called adulterers right
[1:22:01] so I just want to make sure you
[1:22:03] understand just because you said it here
[1:22:05] doesn't mean you have it that's right
[1:22:09] so that ye come behind and no gift they
[1:22:12] had every gift working in the Church of
[1:22:13] Corinth I want you to know when you go
[1:22:15] read the book of Corinthians he never
[1:22:17] corrected their Doctrine one time right
[1:22:19] do you realize that not one time does
[1:22:22] Paul corrected her doctorate they had
[1:22:24] the doctrine right they ought to Paul
[1:22:26] taught him he established the church you
[1:22:28] think Paul put him on false Doctrine no
[1:22:31] Paul put him on the right Doctrine he
[1:22:34] wasn't correct in their Doctrine
[1:22:36] he was correct in their lives
[1:22:38] right they claimed it they spoke it they
[1:22:41] had argued right why they argue with
[1:22:43] every preacher in the message right
[1:22:45] isn't that what we got the problem is a
[1:22:48] bunch of arguing preachers right you
[1:22:50] realize that's the problem right that's
[1:22:52] right brother Rams said when Moses and
[1:22:54] them were taking their Journey when they
[1:22:56] stopped and argued with those moabites
[1:22:59] that's what got him in trouble and God
[1:23:01] said no fussing right is that right see
[1:23:04] we're not going to fuss the medicine
[1:23:05] they want to believe it Go believe it
[1:23:07] I'm going to tell them the truth and
[1:23:09] then I'm gonna walk away is what I'm
[1:23:11] living in you will argue you're gonna
[1:23:12] find some other preacher to argue with I
[1:23:14] don't have time to argue I'm on a
[1:23:16] journey and I'm moving you understand
[1:23:17] I'm not gonna stop stop and spend my
[1:23:20] time arguing with some preacher that's
[1:23:22] right that's the truth
[1:23:24] so that you come behind a no gift that
[1:23:28] all the gifts working waiting for the
[1:23:30] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:23:32] shall also confirm you amen is that
[1:23:36] right isn't that what this word is sent
[1:23:37] for to confirm you you is what it is
[1:23:41] take this thing personal all right amen
[1:23:43] until the end
[1:23:45] that ye may be blameless in the day of
[1:23:48] our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by
[1:23:51] whom ye were called unto the worship of
[1:23:54] the son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I'm
[1:23:57] going to tell you I'm going to stop here
[1:23:59] first Corinthians 1 and 10 is the thesis
[1:24:02] for the entire book of the first to
[1:24:04] Corinth
[1:24:05] do you know that anybody and Paul had
[1:24:07] two phds does everybody know that Paul
[1:24:10] wrote 13 letters in the Bible Paul was a
[1:24:13] writer
[1:24:14] a writer well I was in college they
[1:24:16] taught us there's three parts anybody in
[1:24:18] college
[1:24:20] you're in college
[1:24:21] oh okay it was I was gonna say well
[1:24:23] you're alone to be in college
[1:24:26] we got a guy brother Wayne if you ever
[1:24:28] meet him he went through the second
[1:24:30] grade three times so I teased him every
[1:24:32] once in a while I told him to see God
[1:24:34] don't deal with your intellect because
[1:24:35] scripture said a fool need not air
[1:24:37] therein and why because wisdom is coming
[1:24:40] it's Simplicity now I don't care if
[1:24:42] you've got a college education or you
[1:24:44] can't even say your ABCs that's right
[1:24:46] because this message was brought in
[1:24:47] Simplicity for that the common people
[1:24:49] would receive him gladly so you reading
[1:24:52] and writing and all that and you're
[1:24:53] intellect they got one thing to do with
[1:24:55] it that's what he gave you does
[1:24:56] everybody understand okay this is the
[1:24:59] thesis of First Corinthians the book
[1:25:01] listen to it real close
[1:25:03] now I beseech you Brethren by the name
[1:25:07] of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all
[1:25:09] speak the same thing
[1:25:13] did your Prophet tell you to say what's
[1:25:15] said on tape all right is that right
[1:25:19] that's what he said
[1:25:21] and that there be no divisions among you
[1:25:25] is that right you're not supposed to
[1:25:28] have you know this is what the problem
[1:25:29] was in Creative they'd say summer of
[1:25:31] Apollos summer of Paul sir Christ and I
[1:25:36] told the church you know what they're
[1:25:37] saying if I said well I I go to Brothers
[1:25:40] to him your nails charged yeah yeah you
[1:25:43] know what that's going to buy you
[1:25:44] nothing all right
[1:25:47] if you say I go to Claude why so you're
[1:25:49] sure
[1:25:50] nothing zero you know what's happened to
[1:25:53] a lot of people around the message of
[1:25:55] the hour they've caught their pastor's
[1:25:57] Spirit right and they do it didn't get
[1:25:59] the Holy Spirit right this man don't
[1:26:01] want you to get his spirit because if he
[1:26:04] did you don't be on the same Anchorage
[1:26:06] climbed up in a tree tomorrow huh so he
[1:26:09] wants you to get his Spirit he wants to
[1:26:12] have some hunting land left do you
[1:26:13] understand so if you get the Spirit of
[1:26:16] this guy here I guarantee you I'll see
[1:26:18] you in camo tomorrow all right is that
[1:26:21] right no we're not supposed to take on
[1:26:24] the spirit of our pastor but you go into
[1:26:26] a message church and they hold their
[1:26:28] Bible like who brother Branham you know
[1:26:32] what they did they caught the spirit of
[1:26:34] their Prophet they didn't get the Holy
[1:26:36] Spirit right I know that sounds tough
[1:26:38] don't it right but that's what it is a
[1:26:40] lot of people I believe the message they
[1:26:42] hold their Bible the same way when they
[1:26:43] walk right and they want to act like
[1:26:46] brother Madam well what do they want the
[1:26:48] spirit of William Branham he didn't tell
[1:26:50] me to take his Spirit he said you go get
[1:26:52] the holy spirit so I don't care if
[1:26:54] you're in Samuel Dale's Church you're in
[1:26:57] Claude why is there Donnie Reagan
[1:26:58] whoever you are don't you get your
[1:27:00] pastor's Spirit you
[1:27:02] know spirit amen you get
[1:27:08] you get the okay so that's what he's
[1:27:11] saying that's what he told the
[1:27:12] Corinthians didn't he quit that nonsense
[1:27:14] there ain't no divisions Among Us it's
[1:27:16] Christ that's all it is there's only one
[1:27:19] great one Among Us Jesus Christ it ain't
[1:27:22] saving the only difference in this guy
[1:27:24] and this guy he's got a ministering gift
[1:27:27] in his life that's all that's different
[1:27:29] he's flashing blood just like you do he
[1:27:31] has the same emotions you do he's got
[1:27:33] the same gray matter that you do the
[1:27:36] only difference is he's got a
[1:27:37] ministering gift in him right it's only
[1:27:39] there so if you know if you want to
[1:27:41] thank God for the gift fine but don't
[1:27:43] exalt the man I tell people our church
[1:27:46] will come when I come out they say boy
[1:27:47] brother Claude we really appreciate
[1:27:49] thank you I know what they're saying but
[1:27:51] you know what I always tell them thank
[1:27:52] God don't thank me thank God God's the
[1:27:56] one who put the gift in there sometimes
[1:27:58] I'll get my stuff
[1:28:00] let's see
[1:28:01] who
[1:28:05] it's nothing I'll get up I'll go in the
[1:28:06] other night I ain't got nothing to
[1:28:08] preach Wednesday isn't that the way we
[1:28:10] do it right I go oh you know
[1:28:13] read a book and I'll say bam he'll give
[1:28:16] me something right is that right then
[1:28:18] after he gives it to me I'm like you on
[1:28:20] that line I'll say now I don't want this
[1:28:22] to be me Lord I want this to be holy
[1:28:25] spirit I don't want to be called Spirit
[1:28:26] yeah that's good I like it but Lord is
[1:28:29] this what you want me to bring to the
[1:28:31] church so what I start doing is getting
[1:28:32] myself out of the way I'll even start
[1:28:35] studying another subject yeah and you
[1:28:37] know what I'll do I'll study the other
[1:28:38] subject I'll go book like hitting a
[1:28:40] brick wall yeah I go okay you don't want
[1:28:42] me to go there let me try this one all
[1:28:45] right then that's the way it works for
[1:28:46] you and then you'll come back and say
[1:28:48] well and he'll open it up it's like a
[1:28:51] rush comes in the room right it's just
[1:28:53] like where brother Brown said when that
[1:28:55] angel come to him in the room one of the
[1:28:56] seals he had to stay it up it almost
[1:28:58] took his breath I can associate with
[1:29:00] that I've had to get up and walk to the
[1:29:01] refrigerator sometimes there's such a
[1:29:03] presence come down in my study you
[1:29:05] understand because why you hit a vein
[1:29:08] it's the men
[1:29:09] where you hit a vein and God said this
[1:29:11] is what I want you to bring the
[1:29:12] Tabernacle tonight is that right so the
[1:29:15] gift is the ministry gift in the man
[1:29:18] but he had no different use Flesh and
[1:29:20] Blood just like you are amen so there's
[1:29:23] no divisions Among Us right
[1:29:25] but that ye be perfectly joined together
[1:29:28] remember I said this morning the cements
[1:29:31] love right
[1:29:32] that's what's supposed to put us
[1:29:34] together in the church is love
[1:29:36] everybody agrees with that right
[1:29:40] the same mind
[1:29:42] let this mind that was in Christ being
[1:29:46] you he wasn't talking about the mind to
[1:29:48] Paul he was talking about the mind of
[1:29:49] Christ is that right that let everybody
[1:29:52] have the same mind the same message the
[1:29:54] same Christ right
[1:29:56] and insane judgment amen right yeah see
[1:30:00] you are supposed to judge something did
[1:30:02] you know that right
[1:30:04] you you're going to judge do you realize
[1:30:06] you're going to judge Angels one day
[1:30:09] yeah you realize one day you're gonna be
[1:30:11] sitting there with Jesus Christ judging
[1:30:13] people that come forward right man and
[1:30:15] you'll say you know he was good to me
[1:30:17] when I was on the earth Lord and he said
[1:30:19] he was he said enter in right whatever
[1:30:22] you've done to these little these my
[1:30:24] little ones you've done it unto me
[1:30:25] you're going to be sitting up there
[1:30:27] where is The Mercy Seat today by the way
[1:30:30] when I told you this morning the
[1:30:32] Tabernacle is a feminist name then let
[1:30:35] me ask you if that's where the seat of
[1:30:36] judgment was if that's where the mercy
[1:30:39] seat was where is it it's in the bride
[1:30:42] amen is that right exactly sure it's in
[1:30:45] the bride and you know what there was
[1:30:47] two things in there over that judgment
[1:30:49] scene there was Michael and there's
[1:30:52] Gabriel you know Gabriel is the
[1:30:54] messenger can I say the message you know
[1:30:57] what's in my heart the message you know
[1:30:59] the other thing with her Michael do you
[1:31:01] know Michael never lost a battle
[1:31:03] that Michael that Archangel never lost a
[1:31:07] show it I dare anybody show me the
[1:31:10] scripture where Michael ever lost a
[1:31:12] battle amen right Michael cast Lucifer
[1:31:14] Out of Heaven did he not with Daniel
[1:31:18] Prayed 21 days right who come and helped
[1:31:21] him to get him there Michael all right
[1:31:24] is that right Joshua when you come up to
[1:31:26] Jericho who was standing there
[1:31:29] Michael he was walking around taking a
[1:31:31] look at it and said man it looks tough
[1:31:33] don't it he knew the battle was won
[1:31:35] right you got Michael on the scene folks
[1:31:37] Christ you are a winner I don't care
[1:31:41] what the devil tells you and that third
[1:31:43] compartment in your heart is Michael all
[1:31:45] right is that right man Jesus Christ I
[1:31:48] hope the glory is in you Michael so I
[1:31:51] don't care don't let the devil get you
[1:31:53] down and tell you you're beat down you
[1:31:55] are not beat down Church you understand
[1:31:57] that all right you cannot lose
[1:32:00] how you like that you cannot lose you
[1:32:04] have Michael in that third compartment
[1:32:06] and he's never lost a battle amen and he
[1:32:09] never will right he can't so you look in
[1:32:12] that third compartment all those things
[1:32:14] in incense proper prayer right all those
[1:32:17] things in that
[1:32:19] is what's in your heart you understand
[1:32:21] what I'm saying so what's in you is a
[1:32:23] lot of different things you understand
[1:32:25] and it's showing you the symbolism of
[1:32:28] what is actually contained in you and
[1:32:30] the mercy seats
[1:32:31] is that right brother random said there
[1:32:34] not be another one saved when the bride
[1:32:37] leaves why because The Mercy Seat is
[1:32:39] going to be gone was that right right
[1:32:42] amen that's it a lot of people don't
[1:32:45] understand that but the mercy seat is in
[1:32:47] the bride
[1:32:48] and that's what Paul was trying to get
[1:32:51] to these Corinthians you understand he's
[1:32:53] got it so you got judgment boys you
[1:32:55] started using it is that right right now
[1:32:57] that's exactly what he did now I'm going
[1:33:00] to tell you something
[1:33:01] going through I'm just going to be
[1:33:03] honest with you what we've had in this
[1:33:05] end time and I see it over and over and
[1:33:08] over people are coming in Brazen just
[1:33:11] like Satan is and setting right in the
[1:33:13] congregation to the the righteous and
[1:33:15] you're bringing those old nasty Spirits
[1:33:17] in with you
[1:33:18] you understand what I'm saying right
[1:33:20] right now what I've told you this
[1:33:22] morning brother random said you're the
[1:33:23] final voice to the final age under your
[1:33:26] messenger right right now I told you and
[1:33:28] I want to repeat it look Satan didn't
[1:33:29] have an exalted himself up against
[1:33:31] Michael it got him cast out is that
[1:33:33] right right so if you as a message
[1:33:36] believer you tell me you believe the
[1:33:38] message of the hour
[1:33:39] now I'm going to get tough and itemize a
[1:33:41] few things so I apologize okay
[1:33:44] Brother Brad said If he if he wouldn't
[1:33:46] have a TV he'd blow it out with a
[1:33:48] shotgun does that mean you're going to
[1:33:50] have a TV you're going to go above your
[1:33:52] messenger all right and I'm gonna be
[1:33:54] just Real playing with you okay you mean
[1:33:56] you're gonna and I've had people in our
[1:33:58] church we'll have a get-together and a
[1:34:00] woman hand me a a a dish and have clear
[1:34:03] fingernail polish Sean do you find one
[1:34:06] quote where brother Branham ever said
[1:34:08] yellow red green he said polish right
[1:34:13] he said make up on the outside
[1:34:15] makeup on the inside do you understand
[1:34:17] what I'm saying I'm gonna get right down
[1:34:20] with it and the only reason I'm doing it
[1:34:21] because I said church I want you ready
[1:34:23] for a Rapture right right that's all of
[1:34:25] our responsibilities being pastors right
[1:34:28] and if you don't go take that Javelin
[1:34:30] and you don't run it right into the
[1:34:32] spirit of that thing and kill it then
[1:34:34] you have allowed it to come into your
[1:34:36] congregation and it will spread does
[1:34:39] everybody understand that and that's
[1:34:41] exactly invisible Union it's talking
[1:34:43] about a separation is that right so if
[1:34:46] there's people here that separated I
[1:34:48] don't want to allow the devil to come in
[1:34:50] amongst the congregation and bring
[1:34:53] Spirits in here that'll sweep them out
[1:34:55] do you understand what I'm saying I and
[1:34:57] you too we're as a pastor and I got a
[1:35:00] preach a pastor I'm not an evangelist
[1:35:01] guy so I got to preach what I'm
[1:35:03] preaching at church when you come to our
[1:35:04] church do you preach What You Preach
[1:35:06] here sure you do you told me you do same
[1:35:08] titles and everything so I can't preach
[1:35:11] any different than I preach if I do I'll
[1:35:12] become a hypocrite right did you know
[1:35:14] that's what Paul said in Corinthians if
[1:35:16] I come to you and I got to preach what
[1:35:18] he gave me right and this is what he
[1:35:20] gave me this is when I go home I want to
[1:35:22] start right where I pick I live off
[1:35:23] tonight that's what I'm going to start
[1:35:25] in our church because I've got down to
[1:35:27] chapter four of Corinthians but you
[1:35:29] start taking a look at Corinthians what
[1:35:31] he's doing he's cleaning up the marriage
[1:35:33] and divorce situation in the church
[1:35:35] is that right
[1:35:37] I mean they had a guy sitting there a a
[1:35:39] son living with his mama yeah
[1:35:43] you gotta be kidding me
[1:35:46] and they they knew it yeah they uttered
[1:35:49] it but they didn't live it do you
[1:35:51] understand what I'm saying so the
[1:35:53] water's a separation when he gets out on
[1:35:55] the inside of the inside it's going to
[1:35:57] make everything else on the app it works
[1:35:59] from the inside out it's going to clean
[1:36:00] this Rascal up you understand and if you
[1:36:03] still got the world the things the world
[1:36:04] hanging on you you're in trouble right
[1:36:07] I'm gonna be honest we're going to make
[1:36:08] a Rapture and if if one word threw this
[1:36:12] thing into what it is does everybody
[1:36:13] agree right like I said she was behind a
[1:36:16] holy Veil she walked out and took the
[1:36:18] lust Veil and look what it brought right
[1:36:21] now you were born under a lust Veil now
[1:36:23] you've taken on the word
[1:36:25] a holy Veil and you know what God has
[1:36:28] entrusted you with he says it invisible
[1:36:30] Union a sacred trust what has God given
[1:36:33] you the word right as long as Eve stayed
[1:36:36] behind the word she was okay once she
[1:36:39] walked out from behind that word she
[1:36:40] took a lust Veil on right and once lust
[1:36:43] is conceived to bring forth sin what sin
[1:36:45] is conceived to bring it forth dead now
[1:36:48] that's the steps of it does everybody
[1:36:49] understand so water is separation you
[1:36:52] got to separate from your old life
[1:36:55] but you got to come under your messenger
[1:36:57] folks you are not going to live higher
[1:36:59] than what William Branham is that right
[1:37:02] so I see people I see it all over where
[1:37:04] they wear the clear fingernail polish
[1:37:06] why
[1:37:07] can you guys help me out and tell me why
[1:37:09] when brother Ram said nail polish right
[1:37:11] he didn't say the color so I guess it's
[1:37:14] like remember the stagecoach driver
[1:37:15] brother Brandon talked about there was
[1:37:17] one to get real close to the edge right
[1:37:19] he said and that King said I don't want
[1:37:22] to ride in your Stagecoach
[1:37:26] you think Jesus Christ wants to ride in
[1:37:28] you yeah and you're as close to the edge
[1:37:30] as you can get no what you're going to
[1:37:32] do is the stagecoach is going to get
[1:37:33] close to the mountain as you can get
[1:37:35] right is that right so you're running
[1:37:37] around on the edge you think he's going
[1:37:39] to be sitting in your Stagecoach I'm
[1:37:40] going to tell you no he's not going to
[1:37:43] do that and I sure wouldn't ride in your
[1:37:45] stage coach either
[1:37:46] but as a Phineas mouth of brass
[1:37:50] the five full ministry has to go out
[1:37:52] there and kill those Spirits you
[1:37:54] understand that's right you can't think
[1:37:56] that you can go out there because your
[1:37:58] messenger already told you these things
[1:38:00] you come into the congregation and you
[1:38:02] call yourself a brethren
[1:38:04] in other words you're saying I believe
[1:38:06] the message right Brethren that's what
[1:38:09] he was they were crying and worshiping
[1:38:11] in the congregation and he brought that
[1:38:13] strange woman right amongst them do you
[1:38:16] think you're going to get away with that
[1:38:17] right no I'm sorry man that preacher is
[1:38:20] going to preach that message he's going
[1:38:22] to kill the spirit of that thing if you
[1:38:24] can stand it okay
[1:38:27] everybody understand
[1:38:31] but he's going to preach it right
[1:38:33] because that's our duty is being a
[1:38:34] pastor it really is so invisible Union
[1:38:37] Brethren was talking about a water
[1:38:39] separation is that right
[1:38:42] he's talking about the new birth right
[1:38:44] right we're gonna let these things
[1:38:45] happen in the church and just keep on
[1:38:47] and keep on and keep on I've got a book
[1:38:49] at home that's a red book about this
[1:38:51] thick that talks about television
[1:38:54] did you know that
[1:38:56] Ramen in one place he said television
[1:38:58] yeah right do you not believe that right
[1:39:02] and you know I where I work in the
[1:39:04] office they got a TV and a break room I
[1:39:06] can sit there there's not a fit
[1:39:07] commercial anymore
[1:39:10] you know I the people tell me they say
[1:39:13] brother Claude well I got one just for
[1:39:15] the weather I said really I said why
[1:39:17] don't you get away Oklahoma weather Rock
[1:39:18] and they say what's that I said you put
[1:39:21] it out under a tree
[1:39:22] and you go outside and you feel of it if
[1:39:25] it's wet it's raining
[1:39:27] if you feel of it and it's cold it's
[1:39:30] cold
[1:39:32] if you feel of it and it's hot the Sun's
[1:39:34] shining I know that sounds funny don't
[1:39:36] it
[1:39:38] that's right but it's a core excuse to
[1:39:40] have a TV
[1:39:43] you better clean your house up you
[1:39:44] understand what I'm saying brother rib
[1:39:46] said you're supposed to apply the token
[1:39:48] the token is the life does everybody
[1:39:51] understand that if brother Brandon
[1:39:53] preached against it then what do you
[1:39:55] think you could bring it in your house
[1:39:56] and get by with it right
[1:39:58] now I'm just going to be honest with you
[1:40:00] I know I don't get preached a lot of
[1:40:02] places but I'm going to preach it that's
[1:40:03] right my preach it at our church too and
[1:40:06] you know why I hate TV because if you
[1:40:08] put one in front of me I will watch it
[1:40:09] right
[1:40:11] that's right what's you
[1:40:13] don't tip me with that thing I think
[1:40:15] it's like a magnet man you'll be a
[1:40:17] turtle
[1:40:20] a man don't have I mean commercials
[1:40:22] anymore Phil fell on it right is that
[1:40:25] right me and my wife one day there's a
[1:40:27] Mexican restaurant just to be blunt
[1:40:29] about it we were sitting there and had
[1:40:31] the TV on the corner we're slapping each
[1:40:33] other eating pretty soon this man and
[1:40:34] woman got up there's a BBD commercial
[1:40:37] show them in her underwear I like to
[1:40:38] have a heart attack I couldn't believe
[1:40:40] it I said
[1:40:41] you got to be kidding me is that right
[1:40:44] that's what's on TV a commercial so if
[1:40:47] you're watching the news you're going to
[1:40:48] get some of those commercials you
[1:40:50] understand what I'm saying right I mean
[1:40:52] Bittersweet don't come from the same
[1:40:54] Fountain you better get away from that
[1:40:55] thing
[1:40:56] I don't like I say I know it don't go
[1:40:58] down good I know it there's a lot of
[1:41:01] people still smoking right
[1:41:04] not good enough you better separate from
[1:41:06] those things don't bring yourself into a
[1:41:09] congregation say I'll believe the
[1:41:11] message and you're pulling those things
[1:41:13] off we're out here at the end time now
[1:41:14] you better get yourself separated you
[1:41:16] better get the new birth is what you
[1:41:18] better get because this thing is soon to
[1:41:21] end does everybody understand that
[1:41:25] okay
[1:41:27] it's the truth I know it's hard but go
[1:41:30] look at what he's saying invisible union
[1:41:32] he said it's a sacred trust that he gave
[1:41:34] you
[1:41:35] God gave you this message of the hour a
[1:41:38] sacred trust and he expects you to keep
[1:41:41] that Veil right does everybody
[1:41:42] understand brother Ram said that woman
[1:41:45] is entrusted with that Veil right right
[1:41:48] you sisters have something very very
[1:41:51] special I'm going to tell you that God
[1:41:53] entrusted that to you amen amen and your
[1:41:56] responsibility is to keep it and we're
[1:41:58] the woman's a type of the church and he
[1:42:01] has given us a holy Bell in this end
[1:42:03] time amen and his expectation is you're
[1:42:06] going to keep it right
[1:42:09] so you're either living
[1:42:11] one of the other all right you're either
[1:42:13] living behind a holy Veil or a lust fail
[1:42:16] right
[1:42:17] there's no difference you understand
[1:42:18] what I'm saying right right you're
[1:42:20] either in the Church of Corinth and you
[1:42:22] know brother Branham half of his
[1:42:24] messages he had to correct people
[1:42:26] the other half he could preach the
[1:42:28] Revelation and bring him up is that
[1:42:29] right brother random he said I teach
[1:42:31] preach what Paul preached brother
[1:42:33] Abraham wasn't any different you show me
[1:42:35] a message where brother didn't preach on
[1:42:36] the clothesline can I say it that way he
[1:42:39] does but did he preach a revelation too
[1:42:41] right why he had a mixed multitude there
[1:42:43] he had the Corinthian Church he had the
[1:42:46] Ephesian church now he didn't preach the
[1:42:48] Corinthian Church just to beat him down
[1:42:50] he was trying to bring him up to get him
[1:42:52] over on the efficient side is that right
[1:42:54] so that's the goal of the pastor we're
[1:42:56] not here to beat you down but we need to
[1:42:59] tell you get away from those things
[1:43:01] right is that right amen
[1:43:04] and move up to a vision amen because we
[1:43:06] want to go to adoption
[1:43:08] as as pastors that's what we want to
[1:43:11] take you all too
[1:43:12] right is to adoption sure and you know I
[1:43:15] told brother brother uh Samuel you know
[1:43:18] brother Brandon had a quote he said you
[1:43:20] know
[1:43:21] he said God will not require you to do
[1:43:24] something that he's not willing to do
[1:43:25] did you know he said that right amen so
[1:43:28] when Jesus was born he was born Jesus
[1:43:31] capital J capital e capital S capital u
[1:43:35] capital s
[1:43:36] he didn't become God at the River Jordan
[1:43:38] right he was born
[1:43:41] a son will be given to you and his name
[1:43:44] shall call be called Emmanuel God With
[1:43:46] Us all right does everybody understand
[1:43:48] that he didn't become that at Jordan
[1:43:51] I'll tell you what happened to Jordan
[1:43:53] because he's going to do example what we
[1:43:56] have to do is that right he came to the
[1:43:58] spirit of adoption right right now
[1:44:00] Spirit adoption is this it's when he
[1:44:03] said this is my son and whom I'm pleased
[1:44:05] to dwell in exactly
[1:44:07] there's your spirit of adoption you
[1:44:09] understand so you're born right then you
[1:44:13] receive the spirit of adoption
[1:44:15] then after that you're going to come to
[1:44:18] full adoption can I put it that way you
[1:44:21] know where brother Brandon received his
[1:44:22] cool adoption sunset Mountain when God
[1:44:25] pulled him up into that cloud
[1:44:28] right is that right because remember in
[1:44:29] adoption you put your son on a high
[1:44:31] place and you said this is my son his
[1:44:34] check name's as good on the checkbook as
[1:44:36] mine is is that what happened to Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ when he pulled him up on a mount
[1:44:41] Transfiguration didn't he say this is my
[1:44:44] son here ye him exactly so he took
[1:44:49] adoption is that right so what did
[1:44:51] Brother Brandon well not sunset Mountain
[1:44:53] he took adoption let me tell you you're
[1:44:55] gonna have to have your sunset Mountain
[1:44:57] too is that right like I've told people
[1:44:59] you want to see and this is me now you
[1:45:01] can change this or whatever and not what
[1:45:03] in Revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel
[1:45:06] come down yeah that was logos does
[1:45:09] everybody agree
[1:45:10] you know what and I tell him and I'm
[1:45:12] going to tell you this to show you the
[1:45:14] separation Your Soul and Spirit are like
[1:45:16] that
[1:45:17] okay is that okay all right says in get
[1:45:21] it for me yeah uh Hebrews 4 12 and read
[1:45:23] it for me
[1:45:26] I can almost explode it but I want him
[1:45:28] to be sure we get it right
[1:45:29] he
[1:45:33] for the word of God is quick and
[1:45:35] powerful and sharper than the in
[1:45:37] two-edged Sword piercing even to the
[1:45:39] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:45:41] right Adam to join Samara Jackson's
[1:45:45] the only thing can take that old nature
[1:45:48] off you is the word amen that's what
[1:45:51] divides it asunder does everybody
[1:45:52] understand that all right so if you
[1:45:55] don't have then our message for our day
[1:45:57] is revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel
[1:46:00] did come down logos because everybody
[1:46:03] agree with that if that this message
[1:46:05] there is going to take that old nature
[1:46:07] off of you is that right like you said
[1:46:09] your your soul is the theophany you're
[1:46:12] right it is exactly what it is and a lot
[1:46:15] of people in this message don't
[1:46:16] understand that right so what is it it's
[1:46:19] when that word gets on the inside of the
[1:46:21] inside and kills that over damning
[1:46:23] nature out is that right and then you're
[1:46:27] born again and now you have the divine
[1:46:29] nature of God Amen is that right and in
[1:46:33] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:46:34] with God and the Word was God he was
[1:46:37] logos is that what word brother I said
[1:46:39] logos so what gave you New Birth it
[1:46:42] burnt that old you out of there exactly
[1:46:45] the OU is d-e-a-d Right amen is that
[1:46:48] right there's no more to be found of the
[1:46:51] old you right is that right
[1:46:54] you're born again is right you're born
[1:46:57] Anew into the kingdom of God is what you
[1:46:59] are what is the kingdom of God word
[1:47:02] word word is what it is right right no
[1:47:06] wonder brother random could start saying
[1:47:07] she is him right and everywhere I see
[1:47:11] now when I pick up a book I see the new
[1:47:13] birth I just can't isn't that what you
[1:47:15] do I mean you guys are Jessica you're
[1:47:17] seeing it sure
[1:47:19] it's because and the reason it is
[1:47:20] because God has had so much grace on you
[1:47:23] people here because he wants you to
[1:47:25] receive the new birth so that you can
[1:47:27] make a Rapture right all right now
[1:47:30] remember it's not an option it's a must

[1:47:55] what the devil tries to throw at you
[1:47:57] you're happy happy man because why I
[1:48:01] know I'm born again yeah man I can't
[1:48:03] lose brother Wade exactly amen no matter

[1:48:13] and that you've experienced the new
[1:48:16] birth
[1:48:17] I mean it's a wonderful thing people it
[1:48:19] really is but do me a favor go through
[1:48:22] the book of Corinthians see what they
[1:48:23] wrote and I told them I said the the
[1:48:25] prince church was misbehaving yeah
[1:48:27] yeah that's what I tell our church
[1:48:30] and go through there and itemize and see
[1:48:32] how they were misbehaving look Paul told
[1:48:35] him in the Theses of the book you've got
[1:48:37] to have the same message the same mind
[1:48:39] and the same judgment does everybody
[1:48:41] understand that exactly
[1:48:43] right you're all going to be doing
[1:48:45] living the same thing you're going to
[1:48:47] have under your messenger if we all live
[1:48:49] under the message
[1:48:51] we're all going to be living the same
[1:48:52] life is that right right it's the truth
[1:48:55] it can't I can't come to you and preach
[1:48:56] you a different Christ right right
[1:48:58] brother Ram didn't preach you a
[1:49:00] different Christ than what Paul preached
[1:49:01] we all preach Christ amen and him
[1:49:04] crucified amen and resurrected is that
[1:49:07] right
[1:49:09] a personal experience I like the way you
[1:49:13] put that last night it's a personal this
[1:49:16] this Bible has become such a new book
[1:49:18] today it is it is personal to me it's a
[1:49:22] love letter right it's personal right
[1:49:24] and I thank God that I could have that
[1:49:26] he'd let me have a new birth right away
[1:49:29] so that I could experience
[1:49:32] oh Grace you know what I miss Grace
[1:49:35] right that's right is that right that's
[1:49:38] what I am it's wonderful isn't it all
[1:49:41] right I'm gonna close with that hey Lord
[1:49:43] bless each and every one of you I want
[1:49:45] you to know it's one of my I don't they
[1:49:46] don't call me to preach a lot of places
[1:49:48] and if they did I wouldn't
[1:49:49] because I'm a pastor does everybody
[1:49:51] understand that
[1:49:53] but I do appreciate you it's always
[1:49:55] wonderful to come here and preach and
[1:49:57] like I told Brother Samuel when you're
[1:49:59] when a person when a church is taught
[1:50:00] and you're a pastor and you come to
[1:50:02] preach at a church because see pastors
[1:50:04] supposed to be able to teach too I mean
[1:50:07] you guys do good you know I don't have
[1:50:09] to just teach the ABCs and stuff like
[1:50:12] that all right zoom zoom zoom and preach
[1:50:14] some nice things right all right so when
[1:50:16] you go to the church and you feel that
[1:50:17] freedom and that Spirit right you know
[1:50:19] that the people have been taught
[1:50:21] correctly right amen that you could you
[1:50:23] could preach some good messages you
[1:50:25] understand what I'm saying so I
[1:50:26] appreciate your pastor can I tell you
[1:50:29] that sometimes I call Brother Wayne or a
[1:50:32] brother uh uh
[1:50:34] Samuel yeah I told Brother Wade I didn't
[1:50:36] want to talk to the secretary I wanted
[1:50:37] to talk to the main man
[1:50:41] he takes teasing very good but I'll call
[1:50:44] him up and I'll say so and so and I'll
[1:50:46] say I want to talk to the main man I
[1:50:48] don't want to talk to the secretary
[1:50:49] anyway so I pull brother Samuel out and
[1:50:52] discuss something with him and it's very
[1:50:54] it's been very it's a valuable thing for
[1:50:57] me to be able to have that fellowship
[1:50:58] with brother Sammy right so like I say
[1:51:01] you people thank God for the gift that
[1:51:03] God's put in this church not just him
[1:51:05] brother Wade do that these men can
[1:51:07] actually teach the word of God and break
[1:51:09] it down for you before you go out and
[1:51:11] live it is that right and really that's
[1:51:14] what it has to be and I said it this
[1:51:16] morning that word has got to become
[1:51:18] flesh it has to be that the prophecy has
[1:51:21] to become testimony right right to where
[1:51:24] you're written Epistles writ and red of
[1:51:26] all me right right you know you look at
[1:51:28] Corinthians it says that there are
[1:51:30] angels the world and men that you're a
[1:51:34] spectacle you know what says that
[1:51:36] exactly and you know what the word if
[1:51:38] you look up the word spectacle it's the
[1:51:40] later you know we're actors we're either
[1:51:43] acting out the message of the hour or
[1:51:46] we're acting out the darkness part of it
[1:51:47] you understand what I'm saying right and
[1:51:50] it says in Corinthians read it and
[1:51:51] you'll see what I'm saying it says you
[1:51:53] are spectacle to the world to men and to
[1:51:56] Angels right so you absolutely your life
[1:52:00] will bring people's strength does
[1:52:02] everybody understand that brother random
[1:52:04] when he talks about Mr Lily he said Mr
[1:52:07] Lilly when he comes up he comes up about
[1:52:09] them up comes up and when he Sprouts out
[1:52:12] the Bumblebee can come by and draw
[1:52:14] nectar out of him right he draws strings
[1:52:16] and brother random said virtue there did
[1:52:20] you know that virtue there it says where
[1:52:21] people could draw strength from you
[1:52:23] right yeah and you live the most
[1:52:25] confused life in the message of the hour
[1:52:27] do you think God can draw virtue or
[1:52:30] straight from you another brother no
[1:52:33] we're workers together does everybody
[1:52:35] understand right and we need to draw
[1:52:37] strength one from another that's why
[1:52:39] strength and virtue is so important in
[1:52:42] the message in the Believers all right
[1:52:44] so you need to start living the message
[1:52:46] of the hour if a quote says don't do it
[1:52:49] why can't you do it why are you going to
[1:52:52] exalt yourself over that
[1:52:54] right it's me you know what they did in
[1:52:56] crit they said
[1:53:02] I I mean read it as I mean it'll make
[1:53:04] you blush the life they lived right
[1:53:06] right see that's what's happening around
[1:53:08] the message of the hour we have message
[1:53:10] Believers say they believe it argue it
[1:53:12] speak it know it right and no life to
[1:53:16] back it up right right like you said
[1:53:18] brother Wade they're on dangerous Grammy
[1:53:21] they're on Dangerous Ground because they
[1:53:23] haven't went on and received the new
[1:53:25] birth and be separated right from the
[1:53:28] old man can I say that they're not
[1:53:31] living in a new land right that's all
[1:53:33] right amen God bless each and every one
[1:53:35] amen I'm going back to Oklahoma tomorrow
[1:53:37] I'll be glad to be leaving Georgia by
[1:53:40] the way Georgia's okay as low as you're
[1:53:43] here
[1:53:43] but I need to get home so Lord bless you
[1:53:46] I appreciate each and every one of you
[1:53:48] like I say I talked to brother Samuel
[1:53:50] and you know I just I'm out there by
[1:53:52] myself I don't even have a minister
[1:53:54] another minister in the church so one
[1:53:56] thing I really ask you people is be
[1:53:58] praying for us I'm asking God to grow
[1:54:00] the church give me a song leader give me
[1:54:02] a deacon give me somebody else who can
[1:54:06] so I'm asking for a lot right
[1:54:10] if you're a lot is that right so if you
[1:54:13] would if you'll be praying with me I'd
[1:54:15] really appreciate it amen and pray for
[1:54:17] the church we've had a lot of natural
[1:54:19] death in the church and I've had people
[1:54:22] in the accountant tell me I said we're
[1:54:23] not going to your church everybody's
[1:54:25] dying and I said no you don't understand
[1:54:27] they're sleeping right right nobody's
[1:54:30] died they're on the other side half of
[1:54:32] my church made it what about your church
[1:54:36] is that right so it's not my point right
[1:54:40] there foreign
[1:54:43] but it sure is rough on the flesh you
[1:54:45] know what I mean so if you would I
[1:54:48] really covet your prayers you pray for

[1:57:50] give our brothers
[1:57:57] you know I like what he was just saying
[1:57:59] about the book of Corinthians you know
[1:58:01] he said out of them too yeah that's
[1:58:04] right do you know that run around and
[1:58:06] said that Deacon I mean that man that
[1:58:07] was in Corinthians 1 that was living
[1:58:10] with his uh father's wife which would
[1:58:12] have been his stepmother you know you
[1:58:14] know what he said
[1:58:16] now I can't find it now but I know what
[1:58:18] he said he said in second Corinthians
[1:58:21] he'd become a great guy and was a deacon
[1:58:23] in the church
[1:58:25] that's what he's saying
[1:58:27] I can't find it
[1:58:32] and that's what I believe he knows what
[1:58:33] he's talking about he said to become a
[1:58:35] deacon in the church so he must have
[1:58:37] found something right and get
[1:58:39] straightened up let's just saying what
[1:58:40] do we got brother dude
[1:59:22] my heart for laughter
